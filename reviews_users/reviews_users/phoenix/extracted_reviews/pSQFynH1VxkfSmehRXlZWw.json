A table for six required a 45-minute wait in Bar Bianco.  It was well worth it.  Given there were six of us, we ordered five pies:  Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy.  Okay, I hate to admit it, but they were the best pizzas we've ever had, bar none.  I recommend the Rosa and my wife likes the Wise Guy.  This place is stellar.",

There is definite magic going on in their brick oven. -Caprese salad is delish. -Get the one with sausage. It's the best  Cons:  -$2 charge for parmesan. Really? -Long wait during lunch crunch and dinner. -Pizzas are amazing when great, and just good at other times. Not sure why there is a lack of consistency. Might be time of pie in oven. -Don't get the pizza with the onions. Not tasty. -Difficult parking. Valet only in their private lot, so look for street parking if available.  Verdict:  -Only get the pizza with sausage and go during off peak times. Will come back everytime I'm in Phoenix for work.",

    "text": "The pizza gods must have been looking out for us because we got into Pizzeria Bianco in less than an hour on Zombiewalk night! The boyfriend and I rolled in here on a whim since it looked less busy than usual. I love the look of the place. Small, cozy, lined with brick and warm colors. Loud, busy,  but everyone seemed to be having a great time.   We started off with some bread, oil, and olives. All very good, but it's hard to go wrong with bread and oil. The pizza was where the real litmus test would be. We went for the Sonny Boy, Rosa, and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was sort of boring. The sausage didn't have great flavor and I usually love Schreiner's sausages. The Rosa was very interesting--not something I'd eat very tie but definitely worth seeing what the hyper is about. My favorite, the Sonny Boy. How can you go wrong with Salami and olives?  I know there is an endless Cibo vs Bianco debate so I'll jump in to give my two cents. Both are excellent but I'll give Cibo a slight edge. I like the di Notte pizza at Cibo more than any pizza I had at Bianco. Also, I like the variety of things that you can get at Cibo. Although the small menu at Bianco works, I do wish there were more appetizers or desserts to choose from.   I had a great time. I went in with few expectations, just wanted to see what the hype is about! Would I come back? Absolutely. Would I wait three hours? Probably not. I think this is a great destination spot to take guests who want to know what everyone is talking about.",

On countless occasions, we've heard nightmare stories of waiting in line for three hours or more to be seated for dinner.  People seem to rave about the authentic and delicious Italian style pizza.   We had to have a two hour lunch break on a weekday.  We took a gamble to see if we would be able to be seated within a reasonable amount of time and finally check this place off our list. To our surprise we were seated within 30 minutes and had our food brought out within 15-20 minutes. We had the 'caprese' salad and the biancoverde pizza with prosciutto added and it was INCREDIBLE!!! The salad was fresh and tasty and pizza here reminded us of great pizza in Italy! BEST pizza in the Phoenix metropolitan area! Note worthy food, but probably would not wait 3+ hours for dinner, but this is a wonderful place for lunch--if you have a longer break! Note: The website states, \"Reservations accepted for parties of 6-10 when possible.\"",

    "text": "Overrated? Yes. But is it still good? Yes. When I moved to Phoenix 3 1/2 years ago, Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first restaurants I was told I had to try. But I also heard about the ridiculous wait times, so that always prevented me from going. My dad was in town, and after seeing PB on Food Network, he wanted to try it, so that's where we went.   First, I had no idea where PB was located, and I had a difficult time trying to find it. Unbeknownst to me, I drive by it literally every day, but the closed gate on Adams off of 7h street threw me for a loop. But alas, I finally found it! There is free valet parking right next to the restaurant, right before that closed gate.   It was a Thursday evening around 5:45, and I was mentally prepared for a 2 hour wait; so I was pleasantly surprised when I found out the wait was only about 20 minutes! Nice! That made me very happy!   We started off with the Caprese salad. The mozzarella and tomatoes were really fresh, and the salad was refreshing overall. We then ordered 2 pizzas, but we were able to try 4 different pizzas because we took advantage of the half and half ordering. Let's see, we had the Rosa, Wise Guy, Margherita and Biancoverde. The Wise Guy has big slices of grilled onions and pieces of fennel sausage. It was really good! The Margherita was probably my fave -- the ingredients were really fresh, and the sauce tasted like it was freshly made. The Rosa was my least favorite. Although it tasted good, the combination of red onions and pistachios was a little too pungent for me to enjoy more than one slice.   NEWSFLASH: The chocolate icee (which has a much fancier name that I can't remember) is a MUST! Oh my....I'm not even a chocolate eater, but this icee was absolutely delish! It was so refreshing, and the perfect after pizza treat!   My only gripe is that we felt like we were being rushed at the end, and not by our server, who was male. The moment we emptied a glass or cleared a plate, some chick would immediately come by to take it off the table. I understand that they're trying to move tables, but when we spend $16 each for medium size pizzas, we'll take our time getting up from the table. Nice try, though.   All in all, the pizza was good, I can't take anything away from that. But for me, it didn't live up to the hype of being \"the best pizza in the country.\" I've had similar quality pizza right here in Phoenix (i.e., try the prosciutto and artichoke pizza at Amano Bistro in South Mountain).",

We'll put our name down and debate\" - us  Well, we got intrigued by the 3 hour wait for pizza and was curious what the hype was about. Not to mention, our family foodie, db's SIL (Christine T recommended this restaurant. When she has a suggestion, we always listen).   I didn't make reservations since I figure \"it's a pizza place, why need ressies?\"  OOPS! My bad!  (disclaimer: we had a ressie to Mastro's City Hall that we canceled to eat here instead)  We got to Pizzeria Bianco about 5:15P on a Thursday. After putting our names down we had wine, beer and crostini from bar bianco. I was really amazed there weren't any hot heads complaining about the wait.  Everyone was pretty chill and mellow. I loved the atmosphere ! The 2.5 hour wait went by pretty fast.   Anyways, definitely worth a stop if you have the time in Phoenix.  We had the tomato with mozzerlla, basil and olive oil. YUM!!!  We had another dish with prosciutto wrapped around cheese on skewers or somehing.   It was good, though it was too cheesey for me.  We ordered the margherita pizza, but we added garlic and salami (db wanted to add the salami).  I just removed the salami, but the pizza was sooooooooooo delish!!!  Totally worth the wait, but that's me. Service was spot on! The staff was so friendly and my water always full.   I never thought I'd wait 2.5 hours to eat pizza, EVAR.  BUT, I'd do it to eat at  this place again. :)",

Located just a block away from Chase Field, Mr W and I decided to partake in some wood fired pizza and wine before the game. Meetings had us running behind so we missed the first two innings of the game but I think that was a benefit for us because we were able to grab a seat at the bar without the wait. We had a perfect view of the brick oven and the courtyard of the square.  We shared the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad. The tomatoes were firm and sweet and the basil was garden fresh. The olive oil is what really brought all the Flavors together on this simple but delicious dish. We also shared a bottle of 2011 Toscana recommended by the bartender whose name, sadly, has slipped my mind. We ordered the white sauce pizza ( Biancoverde ) and it was really good! Garlic flavored and topped with arugula. We had asked to add mushrooms and prosciutto both did not make it on to our pizza however, the prosciutto was brought to us on the side and it was deli delicious!  We were so deep into conversation and even offered a glass of wine from our bottle to the bartender ( he happily joined us in and out of moments as he worked ) that we hated having to leave but our seat for the game were calling.  I would say this dining experience was quite lovely, but I would have loved to try the pizza with the mushrooms and prosciutto incorporated. Also, prices are on the higher side so I am having to give Bianco's a 4 star \"better than most\" wood fired review!",

I could use some water but that is all they give us we were not asked if we wanted something else just assumed water. So then they ask if what we wanted so we placed an order and there was no further offer of something to drink. We wanted to try a few beers and a bottles coke.   After we are done eating and just sitting down we notice other people were given bread and a new party just sat down and were asked. \"Can I get you something to drink?.\" Are you kidding me.

Put your name in with the host, go next door and grab a drink, come back and order a pizza (preferable the margherita and something else to try) and be amazed.  This pizza was just beyond perfect in every way.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  Best pizza in the valley?",

    "text": "Found this place through yelp with tons of awesome reviews and happy to say that Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best.   The restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes!   The service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)",

Service was exceptionally friendly and attentive.  Really cool building with exposed brick walls, open metal roof, wood tables. Fun, cozy, small, homey-feeling.  Fair value: $18 for what equates to a medium sized pizza. Basic salad was $6. About $26 total with tax. $5 tip.  Would I go again, ya probably, would try a different pizza, something new and a beer or glass of wine. I'd recommend it for the entire experience.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco has gained notoriety over the last few years for having things said about it like \"Best in Phoenix\", \"Best in Arizona\" and even \"Best in US\".      As a result, if you don't have a reservation, the wait is typically an hour or more any time between 5pm & close.  This is not an issue as A) You can make a reservation and have no wait and B) Bar Bianco is a separate establishment next door that handily accommodates the hungry and waiting crowd with great craft beers and wines.  Bar Bianco is, by the way, a separate review :)  I want to be very up front about the pizza I have experienced here.  Having had two of the six pizzas on the menu, it is good, not great.  It is, in my opinion, not the \"Best\" pizza in Phoenix.  It's not even the best pizza in downtown Phoenix.  On this most recent visit, my Wise Guy + shrooms was mediocre, with an unremarkable flavor and an unremarkable crust.  The \"Spiedini\" appetizer (Fontina wrapped in Organic Prosciutto), however, was simple, delicious and the highlight of my meal.  They have a nice wine selection and a few good beers.    I liked Pizzeria Bianco for the atmosphere, it's upscale, trendy and loud with a lively bar of its own.   It's happening.   Inside is a relatively compact space, and there's outdoor seating that's great for cooler evenings. It's a good vibe.    But there's one final thing:  churn.   They know they have a lot of traffic trying to get in that door, they know there's more money to be made.  Previously, I didn't feel like it was an issue, but our server certainly let us know it on this visit.  I don't think I have felt more pressured to finish and vacate my table in a very long time.    In close, it's the letdown of mediocre pizza and the pushy service that led me to a 3 star review this time.",

Parking is an issue though, it's $3 for valet in their lot out front, or I think there's a neighborhood right before you hit the restaurant you can park at for free.  I started off with their mozzarella and tomato salad. This was good but typical. Slices of mozzarella with slices of tomato, drizzled with olive oil, salt and pepper. It was a nice refreshing way to start off my meal.   Then I got their pizza- half Margherita and half Rosa. Delicious!!! The Margherita tasted pretty typical, nice fresh tomato sauce with basil and mozzarella on top. The Rosa was really good- it was this salty, nutty, cheesy goodness. The pistachios with parmesan and herbs was just perfect. Thin, just burnt crust and fresh ingredients. I would get this combo again! One typical, one atypical.  Good ambience, nice service!",

My biggest problem was the wine mark up. We had the Turley Juvenile. Lovely wine, great with the pizza. But when I got home I found out that it is a $20 retail wine. Great Value! But Pizzeria Bianco sells it at $60. OK we wanted that style of wine, but 300% of retail is really too much. I will give them credit for quality stemware, but the mark up is huge. They likely buy this wine at about $13....and charge $60.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this off by saying that few things annoy me more than suffering through the agony of listening to either a New Yorker, or some dunce that has visited New York, verbally fellate New York pizza. At some point in the last decade, I was delighted to find out that Pizzeria Bianco - right here in lil' ol' Phoenix, Arizona - had been deemed the \"Best Pizza in the United States\". This was a nice thing to be able to throw out there when suffering through the aforementioned conversations.   Unfortunately, or so I thought, I had never been able to experience this delightful Pizza for myself. I had several conversations with folks that had gone or attempted to go that all ended in a similar manner: There was always a several hour wait, and pizza just isn't worth it. Until actually going there, which I recently did, I always assumed the wait was a testament to how great the pizza was, and Boy, was I wrong.   So a short while ago, I ended up in Downtown Phoenix on an intended visit to the AZ Science Center. My company and myself were hungry and looking for a spot to munch. I fire up the ol' yelp machine and BOOM! Pizzeria Bianco is right next door. How convenient for me. I feared a wait, but I said let's check it out and let the cards fall where they may. Roll up and \"Heck Yeah\" no line! Now I can definitely see why there would be, because the place is tiny. But it just wasn't the case on my visit.   Rolled in, promptly greeted and seated. I'm going off of memory here, and if I remember correctly, if you are a larger person like myself, it ain't going to be the most comfortable as the chairs and tables aren't large and accommodating. Obviously I blame myself for being a fat bastard, but it is worth noting. In any case, I peruse the menu and it was hard to decide. I let the server know it was our first time and asked if she had any recommendations. I can't remember what specifically was said by I do remember noting that it wasn't helpful at all. OK, whatever, I'll choose for myself. I ended up with a Margherita, add prosciutto. I remember thinking it seemed pricey, but for this acclaimed pizza, probably worth it.   The wait for the pizza seemed long, but maybe it is because I am looking back through brown colored glasses. Our pizza came out, and it was just a surprise disappointment visually. I felt like I was taking part in a culinary \"The Emporer's New Clothes\". The pizza is tiny. The Pizza is thin. The cheese coverage is sparse. The pizza is burnt. At this moment I'm looking at what I'm discovering to be an overpriced pathetic pizza and thinking \"great, this thing is tiny, and there's two of us, but I'm sure as sh*t not gonna throw down another twenty for another. Hell no!\".   So I haven't tasted the thing yet, and I'm just hoping that somehow this pizza is going to taste majestic and make up for my current state of utter let-down. Bite into what is basically a trumped up cracker and Bruh. Just Bruh. What a freaking bummer. I feel like the biggest idiot. Here I am invoking this place's name over the years to defend AZ honor and it has come to this? The most bland, disappointing, gustatory fart of a bite of food in my memory.   I'm literally chewing on disappointment, trying to figure out anything appealing about this pizza. Literally. Just waiting to taste anything. Bland. Tasteless. I would hand you a slice if you were to ask me what sadness tastes like. To eat this pizza is to buy a $20 losing lottery ticket. It's the same thing. Eating my half of this tiny pizza had become punishment and that is just the beginning of the kick in the nuts. You actually have to pay for it. Bummer.   So fast forward to today, my friend is telling me that a friend of his wants to go. He has heard from several other people that the place sucks and he doesn't want to. We get to to talking and I'm just getting more and more worked up about how much this place sucks. We talk about what he's heard about the place a little more and we start throwing out pizzas that we think would be less appealing and the only one that he came up with that I would possibly, not even certainly, recommend less is a lunchables pizza. Hahaha literally. The \"crust\" on a lunchables pizza is so awkwardly bad, that it's the only pizza I can think of as dissapointing. I'm going to stop at the grocery store later just to get one so I can compare to be sure.   Morals of the story 1) if you read this far, thanks. I'm sorry it takes me so many words to express \"it sucks - overrated\" 2) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING HOURS FOR THIS PATHETIC PIZZA. Literally go to any other pizza place if you value your time and money. 3) Eff you, New Yorkers. Eff you, but you win. Now eff off.",

    "text": "Dear Chris E,  I really think that you should try this place, man.  Chr1s Bianco & Marc Bianco and the whole Bianco crew are really doing something good for the community and that's the type of restaurant that I want to support.  I like you a lot, Chris E.  And, I think of you as a real friend even though we haven't met yet in real life.  You don't buy into the BS like a lot of other people do, like me, and you've made me a better person and definitely a better Yelper because you challenge me and I really appreciate that, dude.  But sometimes, and I hate to admit this, but sometimes the BS and the hype is right and that's how I feel about Pizzeria Bianco.  And I don't want you to shoot yourself in the foot just to make a point, like I often have, because good pizza is almost as good as good sex . . . almost . . . so please, try Pizzeria Bianco for me.  Currently, Chr1s Bianco & Marc Bianco and crew are building a game-changing facility in LA, and although I probably won't be in this city when it is completed, I'm super excited about it. They also have a great restaurant in SF called Tartine that I have frequented when in the Yay Area.  Here is my Pizzeria Bianco story:  I have not actually been in this restaurant but I have had the pizza.  As my Yelpies/Yelpers/Yelpests know, I'm pretty involved in the \"foodie scene\" in LA, so needless to say, I've generally gone above and beyond to have good food.  Whether or not it's ordering Bellota from Spain, Oysters from Connecticut or Crawfish from Louisiana, food is definitely #2 in my life and it has definitely been #1 for many of the people that I've worked for . . .  My last job, which doesn't appear on my resume or LinkedIn or anywhere on my record for that matter, was for a crazy Hollywood Mogul Producer guy who was more than a handful and nothing like the amazing dudes that I currently work with . . . See the movie SWIMMING WITH SHARKS for a reference. Needless to say, this abusive Mogul Producer guy drove out to Arizona to scout for a Film and on the way back to LA, they picked up 7 pizzas from Pizzeria Bianco and found a way to best preserve them in the trunk of their car.  When the team arrived in The LAnd of Dreams, of course it was my job to unpack and when I saw those pizzas, I had to make a decision about what was what in my life.  As you know, career and money take a backseat to the finer things for me, so when I opened the trunk and that gourmet Pizzeria Bianco smell hit me, I knew what I had to do.  I carefully took out the 7 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas, which they had wrapped together in saran wrap and then surrounded in ice packs and I pulled out 2 and threw them in my trunk under a sweatshirt when no one was looking.  I then rewrapped the remaining 5 and placed them on the top shelf in the walk-in freezer in his garage.  He had a ton of security cameras and even a few dudes hanging around his pad, but I've never had a problem getting around any of that and they didn't notice ish.  When I got home around 8pm and hadn't heard anything, I figured I was in the clear, but at 10:30pm (on a Friday night), the Creative Executive called me down to the office for a meeting.  When I got to the parking garage, my pass wouldn't work and that was all the indication that I needed.  I parked on the street, took the stairs up to the office since I couldn't get on the elevator without some sort of activated pass or ID, and when I walked in, our whole team was there waiting for me, along with my replacement.  I knew what was what when they showed me the receipt from Pizzeria Bianco and the 5 remaining pizzas, so I thanked them for the position and quickly left.  No Jerry Maguire ish from me, thaw fo shizzle.  When I arrived back at my pad, the first thing I did was get out my 2 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas and started to figure out how to file for unemployment. I ate everything but the last slice, of which I carefully wrapped in a napkin.  I then wrote out the ransom note from one of his famous movies on 5 napkins & stuck it along with a last slice in the mail the next day.  I've learned not to regret anything and honestly, losing my job for 2 Pizzeria Bianco pizzas was 100% worth it and to this day it's still one of the best things I've had in my mouth along with the Sopressata sandwich from Tartine (& I've dated a lot).  Btdubs, my friends who eat at Pizzeria Bianco all the time say that the entire menu is good.  That's it for now.  Thanks for being a friend, Chris E, and I look forward to your Pizzeria Bianco review, even if it is a 1-star review [wink].  Keep voting with your wallets, kids, and doing what you gotta do to make YOUr life and the community as positive and amazing as possible.  Oh, and only take care of the people who take care of YOU.  peace out playaz, jd",

SCORE.  okay, we're eating here. it's LINNER -- lunch dinner circa 2:30pm. nick bianco, himself,  was at the restaurant at the time. he's personable and friendly.   complimentary bread that was soft and chewy on the inside with a crunchy crust served with EVOO. we ordered the tomato, mozzarella, basil salad. the flavors and textures were ultra delicious. the curds are from wisconsin, but they stretch it out themselves to make the mozzarella. tomatoes were ripe and sweet. they go local with whatever they can. the flour is made in arizona.  we opted for a pizza that was half margherita and half rosa.  now for the taste test of the long awaited pizza. WOW!!!  fresh ingredients in the correct amount put together with the  MOST AMAZING CRUST.   loved the margherita!!  the rosa was very unique as it had no sauce just great ingredients of chopped pistachios, onions, etc.   I WAS IN PIZZA HEAVEN.  for comparison's sake since we are from socal.  we did have pizzeria mozza before.  well, pizzeria bianco is many times better than that. but don't take my word for it, try it yourself.  TIP:  1) the reason why there is a line most of the time is because the restaurant is small. people who know better come in 2s. 2 or 4, no more. 2) if you don't want to go to the original location, there is another pizzeria bianco...also pane bianco serves the pizza also.",

    "text": "From a food standpoint this is absolutely a 5/5 on the pizza scale. Thin crust, incredible sauce, amazing toppings. Downsides? Price... It is expensive (a 12 inch is gonna run you 20 bucks, and its going to only feed one person due to how delicious it is.) Another downside is the parking right next to Pizzeria Bianca is Valet only, which is annoying and extra cost... The wait staff and the service was quick. Im not sure what time the actual place opens on Sunday (we showed up at 1130 and it was already open), with no wait. Apparently the wait is fairly long typically, and I would say that it is absolutely worth it. Spring for the Prosciutto, it is to die for. Any of the pizzas are good, and when the server truly tells you their favorite is all of them... They aren't lying. You cant go wrong with anything here from a pizza standpoint (I havent tried anything else). The ONLY downsides to Pizzeria Bianco is the parking situation, and the prices. Other than that it is a definite must.... Even with those its a definite must.",

I am disappointed I wasted part of my trip to Phoenix going here,  I'm not sure how it got on the top 15 list and want to share my experiences with travelers.  ****This pizza is definitely not worth traveling for!******  I'm coming back to Phoenix in a month.  I'm going to call Metro Pizza in Vegas and ask who their family member in the city is.  The best pizza I had in Arizona in Brooklyn Pizza in Skybar in Tuscon.  That's probably the best I've had West of the Mississippi, up there with my favorite Vegas places.  Note: I actually found all of the food in Phoenix subpar except for El Taco Tote, and many of the places were critically-lauded on the national level: NYT, Food TV, etc. . .",

I wanted to buy a pizza to go while in the area and try it at a later time.   Well the host greeted us, we asked for a take out pizza. He said no take outs we are too busy. BTW THE LOCATION had empty tables inside and outside. He was a rude individual, he did not want to take our order and I didn't appreciate his BS.

Our flight didn't land until 8pm, so by the time we got our car and drove over (just a quick 8 min drive), the wait was only 1/2 hour. We went over to Bar Bianco (seat yourself, someone will find you) for a cocktail while we waited. The 30 minutes went quickly and soon we received a text to let us know a table was ready. Once we were seated and ordered, they started us off with some complimentary bread with a very bright and fruity olive oil. We ordered Caprese Salad, which was undoubtedly the simplest, but most delicious Caprese out there. The homemade mozzarella is everything. For the pizza, we had Wiseguy. The smoked mozzarella really imparts a different layer of flavor that compliments the sausage well. The meal just really showed the good ingredients and simple techniques are all you need for a great meal.",

However, the atmosphere is so enchanting being in a historic building, maybe an old garage, in the Heritage Square district, that I can forgive some slips like the dry pizza and having to wait so long we had to go for drinks in the little house annex next door. The forced wait turned out to be a quieter and more romantic spot than the restaurant, so serendipity had its benefits for had we been seated right away we would have missed being inside a charming historic home and conversing in whispers rather than raised voices.",

Recently went to newly opened location and got in within an hour only because we wanted to sit inside (heating up in the valley).  Seating is limited so once it gets really hot, I suspect the wait might get a little longer. OK the food: appetizer free because of the wait, nice touch, we had the anti-pasto which was not at all what we expected yet thouroughly delightful. Fresh beets, baby carrots, cheese, Sopprosetta, and fennel - very flavorful.  Pizza was good, the crust is really what makes it great, toppings were ok, my daughter prefers traditional pepperoni and sausage to the local schreiners sausage and supressetta (don't know how to spell).  Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean cream was an excellent end to a great meal.  This will probably not be a frequently visited restaurant due to the wait times but we will definately come back sooner than eight years.",

I was first approached by a valet who was chatting on his cell phone and requesting to park my car while exchanging my keys for a disclaimer ticket for any damage caused by valet.    Once inside, I requested to speak to the manager, who took 45 minutes to come to my table to hear my concerns.  However, she walked pass my table several times while talking on her cell phone.  When she finally graced us with her presence, she was irate to hear about the re-occurring behavior of the valet was still occurring and stated she will speak to someone at a later time.  The waiter took our order and stated the additional charges for extra items on my $18.00 medium sized pizza, which is the ONLY size available. (example .50 cent for extra onions or sauce) Once my pizza arrived I asked,\" Was there any Parmesan cheese available?\"  The waiter quickly returned with less than 4oz of processed Parmesan cheese.  After forcing the digestion of this bland, overpriced, limited toppings pizza, I quickly asked to the check.  The check came 23 minutes later.    After reviewing the check, I was shocked to see that I was charged $1.50 for the extra onions on half of the medium pizza and charged $2.00 for less than 4oz of Parmesan processed cheese that was not explain as an extra charge.  I did note on the bill my dissatisfaction and quickly went another pizzeria to get a reasonably pizza for less than $10.00.  PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS PIZZERIA FOR ANY REASON!",

I should also add I didn't get the Rosa --- gasp, I know. How've I'm not big on red onions so not really for me.  The sausage though is delicious! So I got the sonny but swapped the salami for sausage and was really happy I did. The location isn't awesome, I'm not from the area and the parking is a little ridiculous so I recommend valet unless you're comfortable walking around a campus at night. All in all happy I went and would definitely go back. Oh I should mention u was coming from the airport and was exhausted and really just wanted to order my pizza to go and take it back to the hotel and the Douchy guy on the phone said they don't take to go orders but if I come in and it's not that busy they might let me order to go. I understand if you have a look like out the site but it was 830 on a random Tuesday night and they close at 9. I got there and there was no one there so they totally could've let me order to go! So that was a little frustrating.",

    "text": "Echoing a lot of other reviews - it's definitely a bit overrated and the wait can be insane (even with a reservation; I can't imagine trying without one).. but it's still a fun and memorable experience with pretty good pizza and wine.  If you go, I definitely recommend going with a group of ~8-10 people and making a reservation well in advance (I've never been for lunch but I've heard that it's more feasible for that).   There's a nice beer and wine bar next door (which, I assume, strategically at least doesn't mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated).  As long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The biggest shame for me is that they don't have patio seating (in Phoenix it's nice enough for that almost year round). That said - it's a beautiful and central location, and if you go when it's a bit chilly out (by Phoenix standards), you probably won't mind eating inside.  I can't bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review (mainly because they're so overrated) but I can say that other than the waiting (which is part of the experience if you're with the right people and not in a rush), I've never been disappointed or had a bad time there. Definitely recommend trying it out at least once.",

I do not make it downtown to often but would never turn down an opportunity to go to Bianco. I found the best setting is going with a group of friends. Enjoy a good bottle of vino and laugh with friends in a great atmosphere. Nothing negative to say about my experience or the food. Go and enjoy a delightful evening!  Best advice about this style of pizza:   -If you are a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos type of pizza lover you may not enjoy the pizza in the same manner.   - If you are someone who enjoys a more traditional italian roots style pizza you will not be disappointed. Bianco did a great job creating a delicious signature style pizza. Two thumbs up!!!",

    "text": "On a vacation to Phoenix to visit my girlfriend's family, a friend said I had to check this place out, likely after he saw it on some Best Pizza list.   First off, it's in a rather difficult to get to spot.  It's on a pedestrian walkway near the Arizona Science Center... I could have sworn it was on some sort of campus, but whatever it is, it's blocked off from street traffic.  My girlfriend and I had to look for parking for about 20 minutes, and walked 4 blocks at 1pm on a Tuesday, which I thought was kind of absurd.  Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, just saying.   So... yes, this is a traditional wood-fired pizza place, close to actual Italian pizza, and not the thick chewy Americanized dough many of us are used to.  What that will mean is, thin pizza, possibly burned in patches on the bottom, little cheese, little toppings, and small selection of ingredients.  From what I can remember, the menu is almost entirely their 5 different styles of pizza, and 3 or 4 salads and a few other appetizers.   There was complimentary bread and olive oil, which was crusty and tasty. My date and I ordered a caprese salad and the margherita pizza, which was a mistake on our part because the margherita is basically just the same ingredients as the caprese salad on top of bread, and cooked, so our meal was a little redundant. It wasn't bad, but nothing I would write home about.   Depending on your personal taste, this could be a plus or minus.  It's a small room, with what little seating there is set very closed together.  We could hear the entire conversation of the couples on either side of us.  Service dragged a little, and our waters were only filled once our pizza came out.  We were in a hurry to catch a flight, and they obliged us by bringing our check and a to-go box out in a timely fashion, so I suppose I'll give them points for that.   All in all, very \"meh\" and comparable to any other brick oven type pizza place.",

Its in a little courtyard by the Arizona Science Center and you have to navigate a bit of a maze to find it.  We arrived at opening time and there was already a line. Luckily we got a seat no problem and had excellent attentive service. We split a refreshing salad and split a pizza that was half the sonny boy and half wise guy. The pizza's are wood fired and are thin but filling.  I loved the spices in the sausage.  Elegant pizza in a cute rustic restaurant with attentive efficient service.  5 Stars.",

    "text": "I first visited Pizzeria Bianco in 2008, back when Chris was behind the counter, painstakingly making every-single-pie himself. This alone, was fascinating to watch. And after waiting a good four hours to try it, the people who accompanied me claimed that it wasn't worth the wait - dismissing it as a victim of overhype. I, on the other hand, strongly disagreed with their sentiments. And almost a decade later, my opinion remains unchanged.  What's interesting about Pizzeria Bianco is that, I didn't go here once and quickly declare it to be the best pizza I've ever tried. That status came after eating it repeatedly, becoming accustomed to its flavor, and then comparing it against - well, pretty much everyone else. And my conclusion has remained the same: Few have come close, but I've yet to find anyone else that can produce a pizza that tastes like this.   To this day, I still see the common complaints. It's burnt! It's too thin and floppy! There's not enough cheese! Why isn't there any ranch to dip my crust in? How come there isn't a barbeque chicken option?    Okay, so this pizza isn't for everyone. It's not Americanized corporate pizza and it's certainly not Neopolitan pizza. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what you'd call it.  Their blistering crust is key here. There's a satisfying crunch to the outer shell, despite having an interior that's soft, airy, and filled with flavor. On a really good day, when eaten fresh from the oven, the crust will damn-near melt in your mouth on the first bite. They're pretty open about their sources and methods, but I'm still convinced there are some secrets they won't reveal.  Since I originally reviewed the Town and Country location, I decided I'd do something a little different and break down their pizzas pie-by-pie.  Your six options are as follows:  Margherita - Let's just eliminate all the fluff and fuss, people. This is essentially all that you need to achieve pizza perfection. The Bianco-DiNapoli tomato sauce is smooth and the house-made mozzarella is top notch. I've toyed with this pie in the past, adding sopressata or even sausage at one point, but I ultimately feel it tastes best in its purest form. It has since become what I refer to as my \"reference-level\" pizza - meaning that it's what I compare basically every other margherita to when dining out. And thus far, none have even come close to tasting this good.  Marinara - Allegedly, this is Bianco's favorite of his six pizzas. Personally, it's my least ordered, despite still being what I'd consider to be a very good pizza. With this, you have the same tomato sauce, some very thin garlic slices that don't overpower, as well as a bit of oregano. It's very bare-bones, but due to the taste of the charred crust, combined with the sauce, I wouldn't quite classify it as boring - just basic. Probably too basic for some, however.  Sonny Boy - This is the closest you'll get to a traditional pepperoni pizza. Although instead of pepperoni, Bianco uses sopressata, the same mozzarella found on the margherita, and the inclusion of some olives (which I typically eliminate). And while the sopressata is good, it's never really been a pizza that ever stands out as memorable.  Biancoverde - Three cheeses and some arugula. You're combining mozzarella with parmigiano reggiano, and ricotta.  Simply put, it works incredibly well when you're in the mood for something meatless.   Wiseguy - This one has smoked mozzarella, roasted onions, and some excellent sausage. My girlfriend, who typically hates sausage, likes this - as do I. Once again, it's done in a way where absolutely nothing overpowers, creating a perfect balance of meat, cheese, and subtle onion flavor.   Rosa - When I first tried this pizza nine years ago, I described it as \"strange.\" Now, after sampling it more times than I can count, I consider it to be Bianco's crowning achievement. A pizza that's completely unlike anything else you'll try, but yet still feels like it's a part of a long-standing tradition that goes back a century. You have your well-aged parmigiano reggiano combined with some extremely thin red onions. And when I mean thin, I mean razor-thin to the point where their presence is so restrained that even someone who dislikes onions can find the positive in this. Additionally, a small amount of rosemary and Arizona pistachios are added. It sounds strange - and it kind of is. But nothing beats the first bite of a Rosa slice when it's fresh from the oven.  In the end, this particular Bianco location will always be special to me - as it taught me a great deal about pizza that I never knew. And while I have since developed a preference at dining at their Town & Country location due to the expanded menu, you still can't go wrong with what can be obtained here.  The pizza is perfect. And when you've achieved perfection, how can you give it anything less than a perfect five stars?",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco's pizza is not perfect. And that's okay.   Anything made by human hands and cooked by fire is always going to variations and inconsistencies. It's the nature of the beast. If you want your pizza to be the same tomorrow as it was yesterday, you can ring up a national chain and have a mediocre pie delivered to your door.  Bianco's pizza is pizza for the pizza lover. And specifically, the pizza lover who loves an amazing crust. Because really, what is pizza without the crust. It's the very foundation of the form.   And this, this is where Bianco earns it's five stars. The crust is absolutely amazing. It's impossibly light. It stretches impossibly thin. It gets impossibly crisp on the bottom. It produces impossibly beautiful bubbles. It yields in the end crust into an impossibly tender, elastic crumb. And it's impossibly tasty.   Thankfully, I didn't see anyone in the restaurant avoiding the end crusts. Surely, such people must exist. Don't be one of them.   If you've been an end crust avoider your entire life, take a bite of Bianco's crust first, and see what a crust is supposed to taste like. You'll be hooked, and you may realize how inferior all the other pizzas you've tried are in comparison.  Now, Bianco isn't perfect.   The bottom crust can be stretched a bit too thin to support the wetter and heavier toppings. I'm a fan of the tomato sauce, but next time I might skip it for drier pies. I'm also not crazy about the fennel sausage, since I like my sausage on the juicier side.   That Rosa pie is extraordinary. I know it may not sound like much on paper, but holy cow is it good. It's a crust lover's dream. And I love how it's topped with Arizona pistachios.   This New Yorker was initially suspicious of Arizona pizza, but I have seen the light. Locals are lucky to have this in their backyard. And for lunch on Sunday, we were able to just walk right in.",

I was expecting a long wait but was surprised they were not busy at 1pm on a weekday. I was promptly seated at the bar and Dave the Bartender took care of both my drink order and food order. He checked up on me periodically and provided excellent service.   Now the the pizza. I had high expectations and they  offer a great pizza. Their wood fired Margherita pizza was excellent. It came piping hot and was topped with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil. The crust was super thin, crispy with a little chewiness to it. I would definitely order it again. Until next time, ciao!",

We had horrible service, they are busy but if that is the case maybe you should accommodate. We were literally begging our waiter to attend to us and after waiting outside in the heat for several hours this was a major disappointment.  I was genuinely excited to eat here after all the rave reviews. We order the fresh mozzarella to start. The taste of this cheese was utterly amazing, this had me even more excited about the pizza.  When the pizza arrived, it was a personal size maybe 8 inches? The sauce and cheese were very minimal, the was about four inches of crust. This is not my style and I never went back. I do however go to their Pane Bianco shop and easily give them a plus five rating.",

Service was so-so, the guy was nice but kept talking to his team when I was trying to order.   Good beer selection, no happy hour specials that I saw. Got a half and half pizza; the margherita was good but was not in the traditional margherita style, it was basically a cheese pizza with basil on it. Boyfriend got a white pizza with sausage that he enjoyed. House salad was great, came with lots of fresh baked bread and the best green olives I've ever had! So fresh and delicate, exactly how an olive should taste. (I should have asked where they came from, they were that good!)   Small dining room and bar setup, fire oven right next to the bar so you can see the pizzas baking. Really cute outdoor area with an herb garden, lime trees, tomato plants, etc., which I'm hoping they use for their recipes!  Overall, good experience, would return.",

The rustic brick building with hanging string lights and crowds of people can't be missed!  Had a dinner date here with Anthony L, to show him some Phoenix eats it had to offer. Considering we didn't have a reservation, we were able to be seated at a table within 15 minutes. The interior was dark and rustic, candle-lit tables, open kitchen showcasing their brick oven and it was seriously lovely.   We didn't have too large of an appetite so we decided to share the Wiseguy pizza. The Wiseguy consists of roasted onions, smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. The crust is flakey, crisp and the pizza thin. This pizza definitely showcases simple but flavorful ingredients without overwhelming you with tons of sauce and cheese, in fact it's on the dry side. It's more gourmet tasting, if you want to put it that way. If you're looking for gooey cheese, marinara sauce and pizza topped with tons of meat toppings this is NOT the place. The price also reflects it's ingredients at $18, for this pizza alone.  The atmosphere was cute and great for a romantic, dark dinner but is it the best pizza I ever ate? Not quite, but it was worth a try.",

Since it's so small we had to wait for a table and since it was so hot we didn't want to wait outside so we went next door to Bar Bianco.  It was cute and the menu was unique.  There were board games to play while we waited.  We didn't have to wait long for our table.  Each of us ordered a different pizza and we all liked one other than our choice best.  The Sonny Boy was good, the salami was thinly sliced but my son ordered it without olives and I think it would have been better with olives.  My husband ordered the margarita with sausage which was good and meaty, but not my fave.  I ordered the Biancoverde which had four cheeses and arugula.  I thought it was delish but am not a huge fan of arugula so would take that off and maybe add olives and sausage.  The pizza was very thin and more than one person can eat.  I did ask for a side of olives which was a real treat.  We finished with biscotti and the flourless chocolate cake.  I wasn't a huge fan of either.  Overall a great and unique experience due to the location in Heritage Square.  Will perhaps try again for a date night or when out of town guests visit.",

Not only was the order wrong, but nothing blew anyone's lid off out of the six of us eating the four different varieties. The arugula pizza was probably the best, but nothing flowed really well together and the a lot of the crust went beyond stone fire crisp to burnt which threw off the flavors even more. After spending over $100 for five pizzas, we felt as though a good basic normal pizza would've hit the spot more than the crispy thin cracker pizza we so wanted to love.",

Plus the attendant says he doesn't get an hourly wage.  Then the wait was forecasted to be 45 minutes but was actually an hour.  You're invited to drink at the bar but it's a limited selection. Each drink (3) and tip come out to $36.  2 pizzas and 2 waters $50 with tip.  So, $92 including parking.    What would make it better? Lower the price of each pie $2 or use organic ingredients.  Waive the $5 parking with a $50 purchase.  Serve pizza at the bar next door...I don't really drink-was just passing time and it was cold out.  Based on pricing of 3, it earned a 4.  But I'll also keep looking and see what's comparable out there.",

I ordered the Mexican Coke which was the old fashioned Coke in a bottle. Antipasto was delicious but from what I have heard changes frequently. The carrots, asparagus, and aged cheese were my favorites from the plate. We then ordered 3 pizzas for 5 of us to share. The pizzas were 12''. We ordered the margherita with prosciutto, wiseguy with mushrooms on half, and a half biancoverde/half rosa. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the rosa was. Who would have thought that pistachios on a pizza would be that good? I would say my favorite was a tie between the biancoverde and the rosa. Service was great and the employees were very friendly. Highly recommend.",

But there is a reason why people do come here to eat - the glorified pizza experience!  It is kind of neat to see pizza dough being tossed up in the air and seeing the pizza go into the brick oven nearby!  We tried the Rosa pizza (red onion, pistachios, parmigiano, rosemary), but felt that it needed an extra add on.  So for an extra $6, on top of the $15 for the pizza itself, prosciutto was added on the pizza = $21.  This is a thin crust, flat type of pizza.  This can easily be shared with 2 people or 3 if you're a bird eater or with a bird eater in your group.    We managed to have room for dessert.  I can't remember what I had exactly, but I'm going to say it was a cheesecake.  Sorry...it's been awhile!  But I do remember having to wait.  The parking around the area is very limited.  Metered parking or valet is available.",

    "text": "I cannot even begin to summarize (swiftly) my experience at Chris Bianco's Pizzeria Biano this past weekend... So, unfortuantley, for those who need a quick low down, I'm not your girl.  However, for those of you who are addicted to food and food experiences, my story might just be interesting enough for you to puruse.  Sorry to those who have to endure my lenthy way of saying how great my experience was.    My companion and I flew in this past weekend primarily to try Bianco (ok, so I got to stay at the fabulous Fairmont Resort and enjoy spa treatments on one day too, but without the possibility of Bianco, I would have elected to just go down to Miami instead).  We are self proclaimed pizza buffs -we've traveled all over Europe, Asia, the US... all in search of wonderful food, specifially pizza, experiences.  Pizzeria Bianco was finally going to be our next stop.  After reading about Bianco on blog after blog, mag after mag, we were qutie excited.  For us, this was going to be the end all be all of our search in the US.  So, on Saturday night (our second to last night in Phoenix/Scottsdale), we arrive to Pizzeria Biano at 4:30 pm, only to be met with a line the length of the Great Wall of China.  Ok, a slight exaggeration, but what a line it was!  I ultimately lost count of the number of people, but it did hit about 100 with a few more people in front of me.  I later found out that people had started lining up at 2:45 p.m. just to get seated at 5:00 p.m. that evening!  At this point, I still had hope... but, I was concerned.  I mean, there was literally fear in my heart - to come all this way from Chicago, only to be met by the possibility of not being seated and turned away and the option of returning the next evening being quite literally, an impossibilty (closed on Sundays and Mondays)... I was terrified.  Promptly at 5:00 p.m. Bianco's doors opened (hear: heaven's bells at this point).  However, a young woman, walking along the line of people and obviously keeping count of everyone in line, at some point (not more than 2 yards in front me), suddenly stopped and announced that from that point back in the line, seatings would occur after 10:00 p.m.!  Ahhh... that would be 5 hours later!!   Crap.  What does that mean for me?  Eat dinner elsewhere and return?  Hang around for dear life and hope things change?  Go next door and drink yourself silly with a few apps?  I wasn't prepared for this evolution.  A 2 hour wait was manageable; a 5 hour wait was unexpected at the very least and possibly brutal if you were rather hungry like me.    But, I stood in line until I made my way to the front and gave the hostess the number in our party and my name - at which point, she advised that the wait would be 3 1/2 to 4 hours long.  Well, to me, that was enough to give me hope :)  So, my companion and I settled in at the bar next door and began to relax.  A few glasses of wine and a cheese plate later... and having witnessed more than a few people summoned for their table, we were evetually called!  By this point, it was 8:15 pm - a time well under the 4 hours initially quoted!  I was ecstatic!!!  So, happily we walk next door where we were seated promptly.  We placed our order even more promptly - 3 pizzas for the 2 of us (having waited for so long, we needed to experiment as much as we could).  We ordered the Wiseguy (sausage and onions), the Rosa (I believe this is the  name; pistachios and red onions), and another which had ricotta and greens.  ALL WERE TOTALLY WONDERFUL!  Literally - the crust is probably the best I've ever had outside of Italy (chewy where needed in the finish, but crispy in the initial give; and the smell was so pure) - and we all know that a perfect crust is the basis for a wonderful pie.  As to the toppings, my fave was the Rosa, my companion's fave was the Wiseguy... but, we both agreed and have always agreed that toppings are just something that is relative and totally subjective - no one combination is right.  It's all about one's palette.  I can't testify as to any apps as we stuck only with what was relevant to us, but the salad on the table next to us looked fresh and enjoyable.   Funny thing - we finished eating by 9:00 p.m.!  A 3 hour, 15 minute wait all for a 45 minute meal, which we really enjoyed.  We can't wait to return.  But we did learn something - bring a couple of friends, be prepared for a wait, prepare to take turns waiting in the line while the others drink at the bar and you're good to go.",

We finally wised up and showed up at 3ish to be first in line. Yeah you still have to wait but only twohours since they open at 5 but you will always get sat in the first seating.  This place is really small and people seem to still like to come here in large groups and with small kids. The menu is limited to just a few items, I'm not complaining but it seems some folks think this place is something different. You can check out there menu online before you go if you don't like what they offer don't go. They serve a sorta traditional Italian variety of pizza either you like it or ya don't.  This past time I went a few weeks ago the owner is no longer making the pizzas, I am not sure why. They are not open that often so who knows.  Both times I've went I got the margarita and the wiseguy pizza. Both of them were quite good. If you dine in you can get some extra pizzas to take home but they don't have any regular take out. So I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in Phoenix but try to get there early so you don't have to wait so long.",

Don't get me wrong, both places have cute quaint interiors, delicious food and an atmosphere perfect for a romantic evening. Its just that Pizzeria Bianco has tastier pizza- I'm not sure if it's herbs, the cheese, the sauce, or all of the above. I love seeing the wood fire pizzas come out of the oven while I very patiently wait for mine.  And I hope you're ok with waiting, because you certainly will- for a table as well as for your pizza. Yes, even with reservations you will be waiting. Just get outside and discover the lovely historic homes & shops. It's worth it, I promise you.",

    "text": "Ok, I finally went to the Almighty Pizzeria Bianco after living in Phoenix for nearly 3 years, and am truly left wondering what all the hype is about. Is it because someone, somewhere years ago in an A-list city wrote a flattering review? Or is it simply because there is always a line and it's really hard to get in unless you wait, thus adding to the mystique? I don't know but I can honestly say that Bianco is very overrated. It's most definitely a decent pizza, but 3 hour wait decent? I think not. In fact I can name 5 other places in Phoenix alone that have as good and better pies.   First, the wait. I don't care about waiting, as long as the process is orderly and controlled, which at Bianco it is not. Our party arrived at about 4pm on a Wednesday, and there were around a dozen or so people already waiting. No biggie. Well, as 5pm approached, it was suddenly like Euro Disney in France with entire families cutting the line and people coming out from nowhere to jump into the action. When something was mentioned to the hostess, she politely said they \"would look into it\". Right. Has anyone running this place ever heard of a sign in sheet like they do everywhere else in the free world? Honestly the pizza could even be much better than it actually is and it still would not be worth the stress and weirdness of the 'line' waiting to get it. The biggest issue in this regard is the staff and their indifference because, quite honestly, why should they care? They will always be sold out, every night, right?  Ok the food. When we did get seated 1.5 hours later, we decided to order 3 of the 6 pizzas on the menu. The white pizzas were bland, but really salty, and the red pizzas were more flavorful, and really salty. The crust was good, but soggy in the middle. The fennel sausage was average at best, but the roasted onions were tasty. Honestly the appetizer of prosciutto stuffed with fontina was the best thing we had. They had a nice wine list, and they do score points for offering an outstanding local wine that's hard to find in restaurants. Everything was reasonably priced. The atmosphere is quaint, but truly not that memorable, and I think the only reason anyone comments on it is that it's in Phoenix, and it's not in a strip mall. The bar next door is quite charming, and it's worth mentioning that our server there was awesome and kept the drinks flowing. I actually wonder if much of the reason for the popularity of this place is that everyone is half-cocked by the time they actually eat any pizza.  If there wasn't such a hype surrounding this place, and if you could just sign up when you arrive, like any other restaurant, it would be much more enjoyable. The expectations are too high and unfortunately Bianco is just too complacent to live up to it.",

    "text": "I just got home from a short trip to SF today and I feel compelled to wrtie a review about Pizzeria Bianco. I ate at the Pizzeria about a year ago while on a business trip here. We were there on a Wed. night at 7pm. the wait was stated to be two hours. We patiently waited and eagerly indulged in wine and conversation to pass the time...all the while I was thinking in the back of my mind that this had better be some flipping orgasmic pizza. And I mean the kind of orgasm that curls your toes and gives you the goose bumps and makes you feel like you are going to have a panic attack good. Well after waiting, drinking and conversing for over two hours we were seated and quickly ordered. When the food arrived I was fairly hammered and liberal with my opinions. I proceded to dish forth my opion and was quickly kicked under the table by my business partner because apparantly speaking poorly of Biancos Pizza to a Phoenician is similar to telling the Pope that Jesus doesnt think that it is cool for his Priests to touch little boys. Well I really didn't think that it was special. Don't get me wrong it is very well executed and very tasty pizza but not two and a half hours good.   This episode was running through my mind while I was enjoying my favorite pizza in SF at Pizetta 211.  I almost shot the slice of pizza with the perfectly cooked sunny side up organic egg and baby arrugula through my nose. Well now that I am living in Phoenix I just want to stand up and apologize to all Phoenicians that I don't think that Bianco is the \"Prince of Pizza\" or the \"Godfather of Pizza\" or the \"Messiah of Pizza\". I just think that he makes a solid wood fired pizza nothing more nothing less. Sorry guys don't hate me.",

The wait, well let's just say it is not worth it to wait even a half hour for this stuff. Go eat at Parlour or Cibo and you will be just as happy with no wait. Would only go here again if someone held my place in line and I could swoop in here at the last moment. Once again, hype outweighs reality.",

    "text": "Let me just preface this review by saying, I really really didn't want to like Pizzeria Bianco because of all the hype I have heard about it. Unfortunately (or fortunately I suppose), I actually did like Pizzeria Bianco. While I cannot say it was the best pizza I have ever ate, it was good and I walked away a pleasantly full and happy gal.  To avoid having my opinion of Pizzeria Bianco swayed one way or the other by a potential 3 hour wait, and since I don't feel like any food is worthy of a 3 hour wait, I went with a group of 6 friends and made a reservation. My biggest advice if you are going to make a reservation, make it way before the date you want to go! It took three times calling for a reservation before I got one...last night the hostess shed some light on why...they only take one reservation for each time slot. If you do decide to go without a reservation, take advantage of drinks and apps beforehand at either Bar Bianco or Rose and Crown!  Pizzeria Bianco is small and tables are very close together, so if you don't like dining almost on top of the table next to you, I suggest skipping this place. Our waiter was friendly and provided good service most of the night. Coke comes in the old fashioned bottles and the alcohol selection is a bit small, but I guess the focus is really the food. Our group started with an order of the spiedini (fontina wrapped in prosciutto) and an order of the tomato and mozzarella as appetizers. Definitely if you are with a group, order at least two of the spiedini, as it only comes with two skewers which only affords each person a very small bite. The tomato and mozzarella fed our group easily, so one order for a group of 6 should be fine. The tomatoes were so fresh and juicy, and the mozzarella was super fresh as well...all and all, it was probably the best caprese I have had. Both appetizers were winners with our group. We also went through two plates of the bread and olive oil before our pizzas arrived...my only complaint was that I prefer when restaurants put a bit of seasoning in the olive oil to kick the flavor up a bit.  We ordered five pizzas...2 Biancoverdes, 1 Margherita, 1 Rosa, and 1 Sonny Boy. We probably should have just gone with four pizzas, but with five, we had leftovers for some people to take home. I really enjoyed the Biancoverde and the Margherita, although the Biancoverde was by far the heaviest of the pizzas and had intense flavors. It had a bit too much argula for my liking, but it was very good. The margherita was simple, yet tasted very fresh and had a good cheese to tomato ratio, which is very important in my book for a quality Margherita. The Rosa and Sonny Boy were hits with our group as well, although I think the Sonny Boy was probably the least favorite of the four kinds we ordered. For the two appetizers, five pizzas, a glass of wine, a coke, double expresso, and a cappucino, our bill came to $111...when we added in the tip, each person in our party of 6 paid $22. I thought that was incredibly reasonable and actually much less than I had been planning to spend.  There were a few negatives about my Pizzeria Bianco experience: 1. Parking - the lot for PB customers was full when I arrived at 5:30 pm, so I was directed to the garage on 5th Street which was fine. However, even after getting my ticket validated at PB, it still cost me $3 to park. Not a huge thing, but I think that people turned away from the lot (which is free) should be told that they will still have to pay to park at the garage, just at a discounted rate.  2. When we arrived at 6:30 (time of our reservation), we had to wait for 15 minutes for a table. Granted, not a three hour wait, but it just irks me a bit when you have reservations for a specific time and then are still made to wait.  3. The table of two guys next to us were asked to leave by the hostess...she told them they could finish their beers outside or next door, but they had to leave so a party of two could be seated at their table. I have never heard of something like that happening before. Our group was a bit shocked and as my friend said, \"I guess to be a hostess here you need to have quite a pair\".   4. After we got our check, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to take it and bring the change (we paid in cash). Our waiter never actually came and got it...the hostess overheard us wondering when someone was going to come and get our money, so she picked it up and handled it for us. The funny thing was that there was a group waiting for our table outside!   Overall, I would say Pizzeria Bianco is a 3.5 star establishment, but I'm giving it 4 stars (Yelp really needs half stars!) because the food exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and freshness, and our group walked away quite happy with our dining experience despite a few hiccups.",

    "text": "I am reviewing after my FIRST experience at Pizzeria Bianco. I will start from the end.  I'm later walking my dog after an incredible meal and think to myself \"where else in the valley does the experience begin with a wait?\" And I am not talking the walk up, get a buzzer, and wait. No sir, I'm talking people lining up before the doors open. Chris Bianco must love to come to work every day with a line out the door. Because the day there is no line and no wait? That will be a sad day.  I'm in marketing, so naturally I think the setup is brilliant. A small, cozy place, the owner cooking who actually acknowledges you when you walk in and the feeling of honor to be a part of the \"Bianco Secret Society\" when you finally do get in. I stood in line for just over an hour - just enough time to chat with a few people in front of me and behind me. And although I didn't make the first seating because my party was too large (8) - when I finally did get in, it was very cool to see the people I stood with in line give me a nod and smile and say \"Hey! You made it!\"  THE FOOD:  I swear in the back of Pizzeria Bianco is some secret garden where all of the fresh ingredients come from because the quality is there. You can't find veggies with that kind of flavor anywhere. The sausages are definitely imported from Italy (I know I've been there) - so many people might not like the flavor because it's not Americanized. It's all real here folks.   I studied for my venture here on yelp. Every review helped me but here is my own experience and hopefully it will help others. My grandma wanted to try this place for her birthday, so with 4 seniors and 4 others totaling 8 - I thought we would need reservations. I called for a few weeks but never seemed to get through when I called and they seemed booked for months in advance. So after reading yelp, I found out that even if you do make reservations you still wait. So unarmed with reservations, I agreed to go into battle alone and stand in line. It was a Friday, and with 7 hungry people on their way to meet me at 5, I was a bit nervous about being able to get in at all. I left work early, hopped on the light rail and stood in line at about 3:50 and was the 25th or so in line. I brought a book, but chatted most of the time anyhow - there were plenty of trees and benches and so it was very relaxing. When the doors opened at 5, they did the first seating but then everybody else in line waited to be put on the list. We were quoted 7:30. So we walked next door and grabbed wine and beer and relaxed. It wasn't 6:30 and they called us in - and there we were! IN!  I ordered one of each of the pizzas on the menu. Everybody thought it would be too much food, but there was NOTHING LEFT. The pizza is not the heavy, cheesy, pizza we're used to normally - you can eat quite a bit. We started with a few salads and the antipasto. LOVED the antipasto. Salads were definitely fresh grown greens, the flavor was amazing.  I could go on with much more detail, but I'll end this by saying we each had our favorite, mine was the one with Arugula on top. We all walked away talking about how amazing it was and how great we felt, after dining on pizza. That's a sign of quality ingredients.  All of that said, I can appreciate many places for what they offer to their customers. I will definitely be back to Pizzeria Bianco, but can also say a good greasy slice of Slices also does the trick at times. The dining experience is all what you make of it.",

My biggest fear was that the pizza was hyped because most people traditionally do not have pizza cooked in a wood burning oven.  After waiting for an hour and half I was beginning to think that the hype was bigger than the restaurant itself. Wow, was I wrong. I had the Sonny Boy pizza with fresh cured salami and olives. The flavor was incredible. Mix it with the flavor of the crust and it was like a party in my mouth. My family had the margherita pizza and the sauce was simply spectacular. Best sauce ever!  Alton Brown once said that great pizza comes from the crust and Chris Bianco's recipe proves it. The flavor of the burning oak is easily imparted to it. Even though Chris is no longer handling day to day cooking chores I'm glad to see that his recipes are still being cooked the way he expects them to.",

    "text": "There are very few restaurants that can avoid making a two hour wait in to a chore. Pizzeria Bianco is one of these places.   Pizzeria Bianco and Bar Bianco's property is very charming. We spent our two hour wait on one of the many benches, admiring the historic buildings, looking at Chris' gardens, watching kids play and generally enjoying the great weather. We also had a couple of good glasses of white, some excellent salami and crutons and a nice variety of green olives all from the bar.   The hostesses at PB were impressive in their attention and professionalism. I don't know if they have great memories or hidden crib notes, but they immediately remembered our names, where we were waiting, how many were in our party (which changed during our wait) and what we were eating and drinking from the bar. I assume they also did this with all the other guests dispersed across the premises, which had to be at least 50 other people.   When we finally did get in to the restaurant (at almost exactly the time predicted when we got on the list) we were greeted by Chris, who thanked us for waiting and were immediately given menus. After a couple of minutes our very personable waiter gave us some details and got us going. It was a very efficient process that made us feel attended to and gave us a sense of progress after the long wait.  Pizzeria Bianco's food was excellent. Their version of spiedini, with prosciutto wrapped around fontana was served on a bed of greens that was dressed with a tasty vinaigrette. The tomato/mozzarella/basil was good-- although the tomato was not the best I've ever had. Then again, we were the dumb asses ordering a tomato in March in Phoenix. Had we been keeping True to our principles we would have gone with the market greens salad, but we were so taken in by the thought of the mozzarella we couldn't help ourselves. And the mozzarella, really, was worth tolerating the average tomato.  The pizza was unlike any I've had before. The dough was extremely thin, and the crust was so light it reminded me of a well executed popover. It was unique, flavorful and appealing. The topping combinations were very enticing. While we both wanted to try the margherita, we ended up being draw in by two pies that didn't have tomato sauce. The Rosa, which had an autumnal, nutty flavor from ground pistachios, rosemary and onion was fantastic. The Wiseguy, which I had read about on numerous occasions because of the house-smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage was spicy, smoky and lived up to the hype.   All in all, our evening at Pizzeria Bianco was wonderful. I have a great admiration for Chris Bianco's dedication to his craft and his insistence on making pizzas one at a time with superior ingredients. He has created a charming, relaxed setting with his restaurant and bar, and employs individuals who work at making your time at their establishment a memorable one. Sure, two hours is a long time to wait for pizza. But if you approach the wait as just one part of the whole evening and allow yourself to be taken in by the small corner of the world Chris Bianco has created, you'll have an opportunity to experience food created by people who truly care about their craft. And isn't that worth a bit of a wait?",

I went last night for the first time in 2 + years. It was good! I mean, I won't take the weight of the hype and so forth, because the atmosphere is incredibly charming, the service is dependable and kind, and the food is fresh, mostly local, and very handcrafted. Quite frankly, there's not much in this town that brings so much local flavor and independence to cuisine as PB does.   That said, the menu doesn't offer much variety, probably for the same reason it's the champion of slow-cooking and primarily local-based. The wine list is fantastic, and, yes, you will be waiting. So don't bring your first date, don't bring the girlfriend you're trying to get rid of, bring your homies who you can talk shit with for hours on end, because it's very possible you're looking at a 3 hour experience, 2 of which are spent outside of the restaurant.",

He is unwilling to grow the business and add more people because he knows the food will suffer. He's made a choice to do things his way and I applaud him for it.

Being a resident of Chicago, home of the deep-dish pizza and raised in northeastern NJ, home of the thin crust, I've been spoiled. I also spent 10 days in Italy and ate pizza just about every single day in search for the \"best\" in the various cities. Pizza is my favorite food hands-down.   Five of us went - waited, and waited, and waited and planned out our strategy - we would all order one of their specialty pizzas. We rotated so we could all try a slice. The only one we didn't get was the marinara one. Slice after slice - despite its appearance - was literally better than the next. I was so pleased with them all and so stuffed at the end. I recommend going with a group so you can savor all the specialities - and I really wouldn't detract too much from how they make it. Some of the topping combinations sounded a bit strange - but trust me - they know what they're doing at Pizzeria Bianco.   We also got some appetizers which were amazing too. Service was topnotch, wine list was great, wait was long, but you need to prepare/plan for that like we did. If you have a party of six or more call way in advance for a reservation...at least 4 weeks.   Thank god I do not live in Phoenix because I would be here weekly!  Thanks for a great evening of yummy pizza!",

The pizzeria itself is small and classy.  The wood burning stove is visible from every table in the restaurant.  The menu is small but everything I have tried on it has been delicious.  The \"Spiedini\" appetizer is so good it makes me want to cry and the salads are always fresh and creative.   The pizza is thin crust, love that, but I wish there was a little more variety.  Overall, a great place.",

    "text": "I was on my way to Tucson from LA, so I had to check out what's the hoopla about this place.  We got there around 4pm before they are open.  There were already a few people waiting around.  So we went to the bar next door to get a drink.  It was one of those hot Phoenix day, the sun was out, good thing there were a few shaded trees around.  We got lucky to get the first round of seating, once they open.  We ordered a salad and a couple of thin crusted pizzas which I thought they were very good.  The dough was very tasty.  I have to agree with most people that this is probably one of the best pizza places in the US, having enjoyed real Italian pizzas in Napoli.   I understand why the place it packed and having such a long wait.  The restaurant itself is very small.  They could easily move and double the size of the dinning area, and still able to pack them in.  Great pizza at reasonable price.  Too bad they are in Phoenix not LA.",

There's only one Chris Bianco and he can't make the pizza any faster without compromising quality - crusty complex dough and generous tasty toppings.   We've worked out a system.  There's two of us and we try to go early in the week before 7pm.  We leave our name and get the usual \"it'll be 1.5 to 2 hours but check back in 40min.\"  Make sure to call back exactly in 40min - we almost lost our place when we called back 10min late.  Plan something to do during your wait - bring reading, go shopping nearby, whatever.  Both times, we lucked out and got seated in less than one hour.  Make sure to get an extra pizza - tastes just as good the next day - 5 min in a 500 degree oven.",

(ummmm, especially after polishing off a bottle of wine or two while waiting).  There's a reason I won't go here more than once a year or so.  I refuse to wait several hours to be seated at any restaurant. It makes no sense for the customer that Bianco won't take reservations.  Our only recourse.... follow the advice of others here and go find a better way to spend your waiting time than spending money on wine and appetizers.  But seriously, the pizza is amazing and memorable.",

Our scenario:  Hostess: It'll be about 2 hours. Us: Ok, no problem. (Walk around downtown, go to Fate for appetizers, come back 2 hours later) Us: What's the ETA? Hostess: You left?! (Weird shuffling and glancing at reservation list, no feedback) Us: ...Uh yeah (thinking that it was 2 hours to kill). Hostess: Keep waiting.  Despite 3 hours, this turned out to be a good spot for entertaining my out-of-town friend (especially since she loves pizza and is highly susceptible to hype). If it's not a hot night and you have a few downtown bars in your repertoire, you can make a good time of walking, talking, and relaxing during your wait.   Personally, the pizza was too thin for my style (On one piece, it felt like my ingredients were touching me through the crust). However, my friend raved about how it was the best she'd ever had. Since I was entertaining her, I was really happy with the place. There are a lot of little quirks about Pizzeria Bianco, but there's something about the whole package that works into a really memorable experience and I think this is what the high profile reviews tap into.",

They have it set up so that you can wait at the bar next door and they will tell let you know when your table is ready, so it makes a potentially long wait not too bad.  We ordered the mozzarella salad and biancoverde (?) pizza. The fresh mozzarella was amazing! I've had this salad many times before all around the world, and the cheese quality here was just so great. The pizza had rosemary and local pistachios on it, making it a unique combination. I would definitely have waited WAY longer for this pizza!!!  The service is also fantastic! They had most of our food to us within 10 minutes and were constantly checking up on us and our drinks. I love this place!",

    "text": "IF YOU WANT A TRULY HONEST REVIEW OF THIS PLACE...READ ON... ... ...  I don't get the hype over this place???  The only possible reason this place has anything better than an \"A-OK' review is people must be too embarrassed to give it a honest review after they just waited 2-3 hrs for a below average pizza.  And I use the word pizza with hesitation...what they serve is far from any definition of pizza.  We had been wanting to try this place for a while and since the line into the NFL Experience was crazy long we thought, hey, lets go sit in line at Pizzeria Bianco, based on all the \"talk\" we ought to come out with smiles on our face and satisfied bellies.  If we are going to wait \"in line\" for hours on a Saturday, lets do it there instead.  First, the wait is loooong, we completely expected that.  We were actually relieved when we got there and it was only 1 1/2 hours.  We went over to the little house next door where the waiting takes place and bellied up to the bar (which has about 6 chairs).  Now, if you are a \"regular Joe\" (hey I make over 100k a year but I still view myself as an average person), you like the normal beer selection (Bud, Coors, Stella, Blue Moon), you get the drift.  The ONLY beer that was recognizable was Tecate.  The rest, never heard of them!  And, you can pay upwards of $10.00 for a beer while you wait for your typical 2-3 hours.  I also favor wine but I cannot part ways with my hard-earned money and justify $20.00 for a glass of vino.  So in essence, lets make everyone wait for no less than 1 1/2 hours to get in and lets bend them over with our drink prices and unrecognizable selections.  As I mentioned, it was the day before Super Bowl so the \"big names\" were all over the place downtown.  Unless you are a celebrity, you are going to wait at this place.  Yes, we sat at watched as the \"celebrities\" and \"A-listers\" walked in the door with their followers (8-10 people in tow) approached the hostess and somehow got seated in front of people that had already been waiting their turn for well over an hour and a half!!  We had a great window seat right up front and yes, we did only wait for 1 1/2 hours and yes, we saw this happen a few times.  We noticed when we were seated that not only is this place very small but there were several open tables big and small so the managements choice to only seat a limited few or to keep tables purposely available for whom they deem to be VIP's, well enough said.    The menu, completely unimpressive!  Again, being an \"average Joe\" I like toppings on my pizza or at least a \"normal\" choice of typical, expected toppings.  There was nothing tempting about any of the limited pre-selected topping pizzas on the menu.  We ordered and added mushrooms.  We were pretty hungry and looked over the so-called salads and again, there was hardly anything that came on the salads and the prices - crazy!  We saw one being delivered next to us and our mouths dropped when we saw a big plate with a little lettuce, certainly not a $10.00 salad any place I've ever been.  Can you say rip-off???!!!  Finally, the moment of truth, the pizza arrived.  Do you remember they saying \"Where's the Beef\"?  Yes, we were asking \"Where the hell is the $18.00 pizza with the $3.00 in extra toppings we ordered\"????    Pizza crust, there was none.  I regularly make pizza on my grill and let me tell you, MY pizza on the grill made from scratch has a beautiful crusty edge.  Not only was the crust lacking, the thin, no paper-thin bottom was tasteless, yes, completely tasteless, like a saltine cracker without the salt.  As for the so-called toppings, they were non-existent!  I carefully tore off one small piece and what do you know, not one piece of cheese was on my sliver of pizza.  Not only would a little cheese been nice but it would have helped to secure what limited a toppings I did get to stick to the pizza.  Every time I took a bite everything fell to my plate.  Our selection was to have come with salami and guess what, that was lacking on my piece as well.  The olives, tasteless!  The only thing on the whole pizza that had flavor were the extra mushrooms we requested that too failed to make the whole pizza.  We sat and collectively decided right away that this place is ALL HYPE and no substance and certainly, not worth the hours of waiting or the price!  So ignore all the hype you read, somebody's getting paid off to write the A+ ratings or perhaps, THEY ARE BEING PUSHED TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE, each and every time they frequent this place.   Save yourself the time and money and get a much better pizza, go to Grimaldi's (fantastic pizza every time).   I highly suggest Sauce (several locations in the valley) for a pizza that is made the same way and 100% better taste.  Their salads are priced the same and you can actually make a meal of them.  If getting into this place and eating here is on your Bucket List of life, erase it and go somewhere.  Truly Yours Average Joe  : ^",

Reason for 4 stars is because an incredibly obnoxious individual (possible the owners son?) came in. Slapped high-5's with everyone, took selfies with the employees, talked loudly on his phone, etc. He clearly worked there cause he served a few pizzas. Guy literally came in like a tornado. Tall, short hair, wearing button down white shirt with a black vest and jeans. He made some inappropriate jokes (Customer next to us said \"that looks amazing\" regarding their pizza to which he responded \"that's what she said\" - customer did not find it amusing.) He really just ruined the whole ambiance of the restaurant.   Pricey - 2 pizzas and a salad cost $48 plus tip, plus tip for valet. Coming from NY I can get a bigger (and tastier) pie for 1/2 the price. But I get it - we're not in NY.   Taking the obnoxious guy out - 5 stars.",

We ordered the Biancoverde  Pizza(parmesan, mozzarella, arugula and ricotta)  with a side of Farmer's Market salad.  Nothing beats freshly made mozzarella.  I think the ricotta is as well because of the very creamy consistency, almost like a burratta, unlike the store bought kind.  The spiciness of the arugula complemented the three cheeses.  Oh, and the crust...nothing compares to it.  I want an outdoor oven in my backyard...it's actually in my backorder list.    A glass of Pino Grigio for me and ice cold beer for the hubs.  Then spent a couple of hours at the Science Center....awesome day!  Was the perfect timing a fluke, to get in that quickly and not having to sit around to wait?

I have had better pizza before. for sure.  We were quoted a 45 minute to hour wait. No problem, we chilled at the bar next door and played a make shift game of chess. Just as I was about to stomp my brother's king we were called in. It hadn't even been ten minutes. What luck!  The place was swamped and the staff was clearly working very hard. For that reason we lost a little bit of the personal touch. I hate when I ask for something and it feels like I'm a burden. Still, they were very efficient.   We shared a small salad and the margherita pizza. I very much wish we had had one of the more unique options but Davis doesn't like white pizza. Ahwell. The food came out in a reasonable time and we dug in. It was not a cheap pizza. It was about sixteen dollars for one a little bigger than a plate. But it was clearly very fresh ingredients. And very thin but good crust. The salad was uninspired. It was only lettuce and a few olives tossed in dressing.   Yes, the pizza is good but I really wouldn't wait very long for it. And I don't have a problem waiting for food at all! This one just wasn't very fulfilling.",

Our \"Wiseguy\" pie was very good, but for $19 it certainly should have been.  My 3-star rating stems more from paying $6 for a salad that was literally a generously handful of spring mix and four green olives... the lettuce was not even torn/cut up!  It was pleasantly dressed, but only a bowl of iceberg or romaine could have been more uninspired.  I was also turned off by a server who seemed pretty disinterested in us once we announced that water was all we were drinking that evening.  All in all, obviously good quality food and nice venue, but didn't like paying over $40 for a single pie, salad, two waters and valet parking.",

Get there well before 5 to line up to put your name on the list (which for us, meant a table almost 4 hours later). Then just enjoy yourself and the nice random people around you.  The farmers market salad, when I was there, was shaved fennel, orange, grapefruit and herbs. Refreshing-- but next time, I'll save room for pizza alone. The Rosa-- parmesan, rosemary, red onion and local pistachios is fantastic. After 3 pieces, it's a bit rich. But then move onto your buddy's pie. The Margherita was light and fresh. Pizza Bianco is the ultimate because of the dough-- it is tender but chewy, crisp and charred.  Unlike others have reported-- we found the hostesses and the servers to be incredibly friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco represented a conundrum of pizzeria dining for me. On the one hand, it's hard not to appreciate the labor of love and culinary excellence that goes into their pizzas, from the fresh ingredients to the brick oven to the intimate, urban setting of the place. On the other hand, it's hard to justify a two hour or more wait, mediocre wait staff, and tasty, though not one of a kind flavor of the pizza there. My girlfriend loves to cook, and always keeps up to date on the nearby restaurants that get rave reviews and/or have staked their claim in the culinary industry. Naturally, she had this place on her radar for a while. Pizzeria Bianco has been called the best pizzeria in the country by such people as Rachel Ray and many others who have even eaten at pizza powerhouses like New York or Chicago. I have never eaten pizza in either of those cities, and yet I even had a hard time imagining that a pizzeria in Phoenix could be better than what they have out there. That is the collective theory, however, and people flock from all over to eat here. Like I said, I can see why it gets rave reviews from a culinary standpoint, but I really didn't find the pizza to be worthy of being called \"best in the country.\" If you're lucky enough to eat here without having to wait for hours, it is a pretty great pizzeria and you'd be hard pressed to find fresher ingredients. If you aren't a pizza snob, though, you'll find that other places like Grimaldi's and Oreganos serve up delicious, if not better, pizza with a substantially shorter wait time.",

    "text": "THE LOWDOWN: Good pizza, but not worth the wait nor the aggravation.  I've been here the once, after hearing my girlfriend and her roommate rant and rave about it. Our group was composed of my girlfriend and myself, and two friends.  First things first. Being where it is, parking is, excuse the language, a bitch. After arriving and finding that the very limited parking spaces had all been taken, I was forced to park in front of (presumably) another patron's car. Throughout the two hour wait and one hour meal, I was praying that I wouldn't get called out to move the car and find another parking space (ha, yeah right) or, worse, get towed.  After that was the wait. Oh God, the wait. Even though Bar Bianco right next door provides for a comfortable waiting spot with a great selection of wine and cheese to tide you over, two hours is two hours. Two hours is four separate deliveries from any pizza chain that knows what they're doing. Two hours is about half the drive to Las Vegas. Two hours is... well, two hours.  After the two hours of wondering just how good this pizza would be, we were finally seated and given menus at a simple wooden table inside the similarly simple and comfortably home kitchen-like restaurant proper. I was hungry and expecting nothing less than food that would give me an orgasm.  I didn't get it.  Don't get me wrong. The antipasti was good. The pizza was good - I especially liked Sonny Boy. But it was just that. Good. Not mind-blowing. Not life-changing. No sudden epiphany. No orgasm. The cappuccino was pretty good, though.  This is a place that lives - and thrives - on its reputation and exclusivity, which stems from the difficulty of actually getting seated and served. Pizzeria Bianco is one of those places which has transcended from \"a restaurant\" into \"an experience\", and deservedly so. The reputation is justified. The food is good. However, despite being pleasant and a must-do at some point during your stay in Phoenix, the whole experience isn't worth going through a second time; while the food and the ambiance justify the (very reasonable!) price you pay, the difficulty of finding parking and the wait are ALSO part of the experience, and is something that cannot be rectified.   So unless you happen to enjoy waiting, my advice to you is to go there the once and experience it for yourself. And then, regale your friends with tales of how amazingly awesome the whole experience is, con them into going, and tell them to bring home some leftovers.",

There is NO sauce, \"white pizza\".  Not a whole lof of choices, but I guess they do that because they are always so packed and need to make sure they get pizza's out in a timely manner.  The caprese salad was really yummy.  They use olive oil instead of a balsamic reduction, so it is different.  I thought the crust could have used some flavor so I really didn't eat it (too burnt anyway), but I really like how they blended the cheeses, meats and vegetables for the toppings.  We had a party of 10, so I was able to try a slice from three pies, but I can't pick a best because they are all so very unique.  I will probably go back, but I thought a pizza, splitting a caprese salad and one glass of wine just for me, is a little pricey at 40 dollars.",

Antipasta was absolutely delicious, but that's where it stops.   The salad was extremely bland with only greens and oil nothing else. Please put at least a mixture of spring greens if you're only going to put lettuce in your salad.  We had 2 pies. I like to try unique pizzas, and they have one with pistaccios.  Had to try that, and we had one of their other suggested pies with salami and olives.  Both pizzas were beyond charred, and trust me I love an extra crispy thin crust pie.  These were both ridiculous.  I would understand if I asked for well done, but these were their normal cooked pies.  The salami and olive pie was inedible; it tasted like a burned salt lick.  The pistaccio pie was too burned to get the flavor, but from what I could tell it too wouldn't of been that good.  All four of us that dined there that night are pizza fanatics, and we were extremely excited to finally dine here.  We were all terribly disappointed.  The price was very reasonable considering the quality of ingredients.  They should know when to pull a pie out of the oven, or at least within ten minutes of that time.  They should keep an eye on a wood fire oven like that instead of letting pizzas almost start on fire.  I can't believe they didn't remake them, and actually sent those pies out.  Maybe that is why everyone waits 3 hours to dine here, they probably burn all the food and have to remake it.",

I always start with the Antipasto platter & Spiedini, although if it's just one other person & myself, I'll skip the Spiedini.  Their Antipasto platter is definitely my favorite anywhere, hands down.  It's served warm and all the vegetables, cheeses, and meats literally melt in my mouth.  I'm salivating thinking about it.  The Rosa and the Biancoverde are my favorite pizzas.  (The Margherita is always a classic, but I'll usually only order it if I'm with a lot of people.)  The Rosa comes with onions, pistachios, and parmigiano reggiano cheese which, although sounds unusual, is amazing.  The Biancoverde is covered in arugula and melty cheese.  Part of the Pizzeria Bianco goodness is that all the ingredients come from the farmers' market so everything is always fresh and local.  Ooo and the crust.  Wood-fried, with the right balance of crispy & doughy.  (Don't overdo it on the bread!  Save your appetite for finishing the pizza!)  This place is definitely worth the wait...one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants!",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco delivers on a great handmade, wood fired, traditional pizza.  Its touch to dethrone my personal LA favorite pizza from Mozza but Bianco is right there at the line!   I had been warned about the long waits, and seen them first hand in the evenings walking home from the stadium, so I slipped in right at 11 for the start of lunch.  I got a table right away and was able to enjoy a great meal without feeling rushed in any way, I would definitely suggest trying for weekday lunch if you want to miss the crowds.  The pizza was really good with the great wood fired flavor that you can only experience in a few spots such as Bianco and Mozza.  The dough and crust were perfect, I was really impressed with the crust that took on a great caramelized taste right around the edges.  Don't run from what you think may be burnt spots, embrace the caramelized doughy bliss.  I sampled the Margherita which I consider the ultimate pizza to judge a spot by, and the Wiseguy because it sounded great and I could not pass up house smoked mozzarella.  The Margherita passed the test with flying colors, the basil had a great aromatic presence that perfectly complimented the great tomato sauce.  The Wiseguy was impressive and the smoked mozzarella complimented the wood fired greatness of the pizza as a whole.  Well done Pizzeria Bianco, if Phoenix were my hometown then you would be my top craft pizza spot in the States",

My expectations may have been too high. Our party of four went for a late lunch, we did not have to wait for a table.   My fiance and I decided to try 2 pies, the margherita and the Biancoverde. The Margherita pie came out quite dry, not with the wonderful chewy crust that a great margherita should have... however, the Biancoverde, a white pizza with Ricotta and arugala, was fantastic! Incredible flavors, the extra toppings kept this pie perfectly moist and delicious, it was really quite perfect.  Unfortunately, we had a hair in one of our pizzas, however, that's only part of the reason for the mediocre rating...  The hair, the 1-2 star margherita, and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating... (I'm a bit of a carnivore, I need more meat!) I'm still looking for something to replace the incredible pizzas I've had at my favorite neopolitana joing back home in Canada, Famoso.   Will I be back to Pizzeria Bianco for another go?

The atmosphere is definitely what makes this place so great, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. I recommend the margherita pizza with procuitto added, the arugula that's placed on top gives the pizza a great contrast/different taste thats excellent. We also had another pizza (the last one listed in the pizza section on the menu) that was equally as good.   The only reason i gave the review 4 stars is because of the wait. Everytime I've been here there has been at least a 2hr wait. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, so you have to show, get your name on the list, and wait. Bar Bianco (an old house right next door that's been converted into a bar) definitely makes this wait go by faster, and has an equally great atmosphere as well. You can order some small appetizers there, choose something from the beer and wine list (try the dos cabezas if you like reds) and they will come and get you when your table is ready. The food is definitely worth the wait tho, I have never been disappointed and will definitely be back.",

We tried to go on numerous nights but each night the wait was longer then the last! We finally decided on the night before we left to make our way over EARLY..... And still had to wait 40 minutes which didn't bother us a bit.... We headed next door to the wine bar and had a few drinks.  We got literally a little bit of everything. 10 pizzas and 6 apps. Each one better then the last. My favorite was the rosa pizza and there was an app that had arugula and mozzarella cheese on a skewer I think...... And that bottle of wine. :) Overall it was totally worth the wait and not really that expensive considering the party we had and what we ordered. They accommodated our 10 people the best they could. If you've ever been there you know how small it is inside. We were there for 2 hrs and spent a good chunk of change on alcohol and food.... But definitely got the \"it's time to leave vibe\" bc they started their peek operating dinner hours.  I'd go back.... No questions asked.",

    "text": "If you don't love it, you don't get it.  Make an evening of the Bianco's experience.  Here's how:  When you arrive, walk inside and put your name on the wait list.  They will tell you an astonishing number like, \"Your table will be ready in three hours.\"  Don't worry, waiting is just as fun as eating there.  Proceed next door to the wine bar.  Order an appetizer and a bottle of wine.  Enjoy the company of your friends.  Slow yourself down, relaaaaax.  Order another bottle of wine.  At some point midway through this bottle your table will be ready, if you do it right.  I have never waited the actual time quoted by the hostess (or it didn't seem like it because I was having fun).  After a few glasses of wine, and the fun but hefty wait, your food will taste better than if you had gotten it instantly--  I promise.  After getting your table, continue to relax and enjoy yourself.  You waited for this table, and it is yours.  I recommend that you order at least one more pizza than you think you want, because you will want it, if not right then, at least later.  Have another bottle of wine with your food.  Here is what to order:  MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil   ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios   BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  +++ ADD Crimini Mushrooms  Again, if you try it, and you don't like it, that says more about you than the place.  It is okay though!  Bianco's is not for everyone.  Walmart is for everyone, and look what that place is like!  The difference is, this restaurant is NOTpretentious.  The owner cooks the pizza right in front of you, while watching Suns games with his cap on backwards.  If you don't think you can handle the wait, I have a simple solution:  Go anywhere else.  Excercise your freedom of choice!",

    "text": "Reading the reviews of Pizzeria Bianco is hilarious to me, as a Phoenician.  For anyone reading this, allow me to say that no matter what anyone else says, I promise that you can trust me when *I* say that if you have not eaten here, you must, and you will want to come back. This is the premier eatery in Phoenix. It is the best pizza in the country. A writer for the New York Times once wrote that in his column and nearly lost his life for doing so. The only way to make better pizza is to do what the owner, Chris Bianco, does: make each individual pizza every single night with your own two hands, grow your own basil and fresh tomatoes, and import the finest ingredients from as far away as Italy. No one does that. No one is crazy and OCD enough to consistently do it for over ten years.   Chris is.   If you can sense the passion I feel for this place, good. There's a reason for the defensiveness. People who come here and don't like it (a) weren't educated on what to expect regarding wait times, or (b) are simply in stubborn denial and can never be saved. That's just the way it is. Some people still insist the earth is flat.  So what's the deal with wait times? It's really not that complicated and if you know what to expect, your experience will be perfect. (Yes, perfect). They don't take phone reservations. If you show up with a small party (let's say 4 people) at 6 pm, a two hour wait time is typical. What do you do during those two or more hours? Plenty of things! Pizzeria Bianco is right next to Bar Bianco, which is a charming restored historical house with great service, nice appetizers and a lovely drink menu of unique brews and wines. The bar alone is the kind of place you would go to chill out with friends, so killing your wait time there is not exactly a chore. Alternatively, you can wander out of the Heritage Park area where the restaurant is and have a drink elsewhere downtown, say the Roosevelt or Majerles.   The key to all this is as follows: Their ETA's are on-the-spot accurate, and you'd better be back within 30 mins of that in case they are early. If you lose your spot in line, you're screwed. On a busy night you will probably not get seated again. The one reviewer who missed his spot and was seated one hour later was incredibly lucky.   Almost everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious. I like several of their appetizers. The tomato/mozarella is comprised of hand-picked tomatoes and mozarella that Chris (again) makes himself every day. The \"Spiedini\" consists of a mouth-watering melted cheese wrapped in Italian prosciutto. Mmm. There is a small set of choices (5 or 6) of their custom made pizzas. My personal favorite is the Wiseguy. You can also hand-pick your own toppings. Be aware that the pizza is thin-crust, and a few of their selections are sans tomato sauce. The ratio I've found that works best is approximately 3 pizzas for 4 people. One per person usually leads to taking some of the left-overs home, and since I live downtown this in turn typically involves my handing the take-out box to an extremely lucky and usually very happy homeless dude (downtown has no shortage of those if you walk around, alas).   You cannot know or understand Phoenix (or claim to be a True Phoenician if you live here), if you haven't eaten at Bianco. Go forth and enjoy. You can thank me later.",

    "text": "Eh this pizza was pretty good I suppose. There was an awful lot of hype and much too long of a wait for us to have been discussing out favorite delivery chains during dinner.  The hostess got a little rude because our group was \"incomplete\" (I feel like she really gets me!).  The server was so charming, friendly and funny that it was extra disappointing to realize he pretty much took the order delivered the food and...well and nothing that was about it. Not terrible service but not great by any means.  Had we waited 20 minutes as apposed to two and a half hours and had the staff een a bit less off, this place could easily hit the 4 star mark. As it is I had to be very optimistic and throw in a lot of benefit of the doubt to go with 3.",

    "text": "I had been really looking forward to eating at Pizzeria Bianco as my last restaurant in Phoenix.  In my 8 years here as a Phoenician, I had never set aside an evening to devote to getting a pizza here.  So for my last evening here, I made a point of going.  It was okay.  I don't think it's the best pizza in Arizona, let alone America.  It definitely wasn't worth the 2 1/2 hour wait. And it absolutely was not worth the attitude from the bitchy hostess.  I didn't like the charred bread that covered my hands and face with soot and gave the pizza a bitter and burnt flavor. And the pizza with salami we ordered was limp and soggy.  Ignoring those things, the pizza was pretty good.  And I did ignore those things because I was starving.  Maybe that's why so many people love this place - being taunted with the idea of good pizza for hours kind of skews ones perception.",

Thank goodness I read the reviews here so I wasn't surprised.  4 people who were going to eat with me and my friend high-tailed it out of there when they heard the wait time. We stuck it out with a couple of glasses of muscato from Bar Bianco next door. Dessert first.  We were lucky, we were seated within 2.5 hours instead of the 3 hour wait we were promised.  My Rosa pizza was very good hot from the oven.  Not so much the next day room temp in the hotel room.  Would I go again? absolutely!  It was everything I had envisioned in my head for the last 4 months!  The Wiseguy with the fennel sausage was not so great.  Both my friend and I concurred that the sausage would be better as ground sausage rather than the slices they used.  I guess they should have asked us.",

    "text": "Ok just to preface - if you are going to pizzeria bianco, you better know you are going for the experience not just the food.  But for the record, the food - is AMAZING.  Be prepared.... Yes, the wait is long.  Yea, on a Wednesday, you probably dont want to be waiting 2+ hours for a 14 dollar pizza.  But you have to respect why its this long wait exists - Chris Bianco single-handedly makes EVERY SINGLE PIZZA FRESH TO ORDER.  BY HIMSELF.    The wait is made far less worse by hitting up his 3rd business directly next door, Bar Bianco.  Its reasonably priced with 8 bucks a glass - ps you must try the moscato, its sweet but amazing.  The ambiance is calm and relaxing, just sit back with a cheese plate and a glass and enjoy.   So accept it.  This man knows what he's doing - his flavors are fresh, unique, and individual.  Portions are perfect, prices are very reasonable (14 av. per pizza)  very decent wine and beer selection.  There is no dessert, but trust that you wont need it!  If you live in Phoenix, you like fresh food, you WILL love bianco's greatness.",

Between the three of us at our end of the table, we ordered 3 different pizzas to share.  The pizzas were okay...definitely not spectacular like many others are saying, but not bad...NO WAY is this the BEST in the US!  On top of that, it is over-priced.  I think all of us were in agreement that the reviews were over-hyped.  The restaurant is \"cozy and brick-walled\"...like their description and the service was good...no complaints there!

It's been two years since I've lived in Phoenix and while I was there I never got the chance to eat at this uber-famous world renowned pizzeria that has been featured on Oprah, Martha Stewart, and in Bon Appetit as the best pizza in America.  Not that I didn't want to, I just never got the opportunity to go.  Well, During a mini-vacation to the city of the sun this weekend, I had one thing in mind, and that was to wait the 4 hrs and eat some pizza lovingly made by none other than Chris Bianco himself.  Let me just say this....The Hype?  Believe it!!!  And, it totally is worth the wait.    I have heard stories of loooooooooong lines waiting to get into Pizzeria Bianco.  Stories of lines 4 hours long are not uncommon, and it sounds really dreadful to wait in a line that long.  What does a great businessman do?  He opens a wine bar right next door, cleans up the lot, takes names, establishes a system to let people roam free while they wait, and plies them with wine.  Happy people, problem solved.  Disneyland could learn a lesson or two from the man.  Once you get seated, the waiting is pretty much officially over, you sit, you order, you get food.  And I can not properly describe the glory of this food.  It is the best pizza I have had, ever.  Let me tell you this...I had a slice of pizza in my claw when I came out of the womb.  I've been eating pizza for 41 years!  There were 4 of us, and we ordered the prosciutto wrapped fontina (sublime) and the anti pasta salad, warm, salty, fresh, crazy unique, and  perfect for 4 to share.  We each ordered 1 pizza: 1 Margarita 1 Wiseguy 1 Biancoverde 1 Sonny boy  The pizza cant be described in words.  Chris Bianco brings pizza to a new level.  The combination of flavors is so exquisite,  that no other pizza in the country can compare.  The crust was crunchy and chewy, and I even saw some coming out of the hearth on fire!  You have to experience it yourself, and then once you do, you will know.  Read the menu on the link above to get the idea.  We ended up taking a slice of each home, but that was only because we were obliged to, otherwise there would have been none left.   I had a cappuccino for dessert, and it ended the already perfect experience on a celestial note.  I encourage one and all to go to Pizzeria Bianco if you are ever in Phoenix, but make sure you call me before you go, I don't want to wait any longer than I have to.",

    "text": "How disappointing.   We had heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to give it a try on a Friday afternoon. We went there pretty early and were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table. The service was pleasant enough but we were starving so we were primarily focused on the food. Our pizzas came out fairly fast. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Rosa (with extra mushrooms for the latter). The first few bites were good (we now think it was because we were so hungry) but over the next couple of minutes the pizzas became less and less pleasurable to eat. The crust was thin (no issue there, we both appreciate a good thin-crust pizza) and very very hard. So hard, in fact, that it hurt the roofs of our mouths and we could feel it for a couple of days afterwards. I had to keep washing it down with water to soften each bite. While I enjoyed the flavors of the Rosa, I probably had about a tablespoon's worth of sauce and toppings on mine, and it dried out within minutes. My husband had a similar complaint about the Wiseguy, and upon tasting it, I thought it also could have used a little more flavor. We both felt the crust tasted like a dried-out ciabatta. The only reason we finished the hard crusts was that we were still hungry. Overall, we definitely won't be going back there. Grossly overpriced for what it is. I can't even imagine how upset we would have been if we'd had to wait for a table given the quality of the meal. And the pizza certainly didn't rank anywhere near our top 20.",

    "text": "This is the Pizza Nazi.  It's definitely out of the way, in an odd part of downtown Phoenix, and the wait can be pretty gnarly - I recommend packing provisions, in case the wait is unbearable...   Prior to eating here, I'd read raves and reviews of this bastion of thin crust pizza in Saveur and Gourmet Magazine.  The proprietor is kind of a lunatic - he makes his own sausage... but I like that kind of fanatacism.  He kind of reminds me of the Soup Nazi... and having eaten the crab bisque there at least a dozen times... Seinfeld DOWNPLAYED the vibe.  It is what it is.  Once we found the place, (there was a lot of construction and accessibility was kind of wonky) we waited for about 45 minutes... they do have candle lit tables and wine service while you salivate, waiting patiently for a table to become available.  This restaurant is definitely part of the \"slow food movement\" -  the salads are incredibly fresh and crisp, and the pizza... definitely worth the wait.  Obviously, you want to implement some \"strategery\" and arrive early, so as not to get stuck in the queue.    If you want the equivalent of pizza from the Gap, then by all means, call up one of those places that keeps their product under heat lamps and guarantees delivery in 30 minutes or it's free.  But if you're looking for the Savile Row version of pizza, this is where you need to be.    The pizza  arrives, toothsome and crisp, direct from their wood burning oven, made to order... bubbled and complete with a perfectly juuuuuust charred crust  This is the kind of mad genius that is essentially non-negotiable, because it's so eye-rollingly delicious.    Get your headspace right - this is an experience, not a standard reservation.  Go early, have a glass of wine, be in the moment:  revel in the comfortably arid dusk, and just enjoy it.",

    "text": "All things considered, Bianco gets 2 stars.  Only pizza/food considered, I'd probably give it a 3.5 or 4 stars.  However, half of dinning is the experience.  And when it comes to Bianco, the experience is terrible.  Basically if you don't like to wait longer than 1-2 hrs for a table, you should go somewhere else.  The owner purposely keeps the place small so the wait time is always over 1 hour.  They only take reservations for 6 or more people (assuming availability).  They own the house next door and have converted it to a bar/waiting area.  Actually even the waiting area requires you to wait in order to score a seat inside.  Otherwise you are doomed to wait in the 100+ degree heat on the porch.    Having eaten at Bianco, I am really perplexed by why there is always such a wait.  I mean the pizza is pretty decent but bang for buck it's really not that much better than the Phoenix chain NYPD (NY Pizza Dept).  The only assumption I can make is that Phoenix area lacks well-reviewed restaurants so people always flock to Bianco because it has been pretty well-publicized.    As for the food, Bianco has pretty good pizza.  After all the chef did grow up in Brooklyn.  The pizza is thin crusted, good amount of cheese and sauce and they are wood-oven cooked.  The menu has a choice of 7 or 8 pizzas, a few appetizers and a few deserts.  If you want good pizza without a wait, go somewhere else.  If you want to wait for 2 hours, eat good pizza and be able to say you ate at the pretentious Bianco's then go try it.  ADDED: Finally, I think part of the reason why I think it is over-hyped is because it is pizza.  In my opinion, something like Bianco's pizza has minimal ingredients and uncomplicated tricks of the trade.  Of course there is probably a lot of skill that goes into making the dough exactly the right way and I can respect that.  He does a good job at that.  The sauce probably has some ingredients and seasonings that add to the quality.  But at the end of the day, it is pizza...and American pizza at that.  He makes all the pizzas himself because he wants to, not because he has to.  If he wanted to, I can't imagine it would be terribly difficult to hire assistants to help him put the sauce, toppings and cheese on.  =)",

    "text": "Best pizza in the country my ass! There is no way some pizza place in Phoenix can compete with Chicago & New York or could it?  That was the question I was out to answer on Tuesday night at 9:15 PM as I put my name down at Pizzeria Bianco.  After a 15 minute wait I was seated and ready to try \"The Best Pizza in the Country.\"  Being the consummate fat ass, I ordered the Spiedini, a Caprese, the Sonny Boy, and bottle of Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale all for lil ole me! The Spiedini was a string cheese like piece of Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto and served warm atop a bed of baby arugula.  You can't beat cheese wrapped in prosciutto can you?  I can't.  The Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with EVOO salad was brilliant. The mozzarella was soft and had a beautiful saltiness to it.  I could have eaten 2 pounds of the cheese alone.  Making the dish really sing was the super ripe and delicious tomatoes.  If I had to manufacture a gripe about this dish it would be that they may have been a little heavy handed with the EVOO.    Here comes my pizza! The Sonny Boy is topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and gaeta olives.  Man was this a good pie.  The crust is crusty, flaky, a bit blackened, and thin while still being a tad chewy.  The tomato sauce was so plain and simple that it made me question why anybody would go and ruin perfectly good tomato sauce by over seasoning it.  The salami and olives paired perfectly and worked in concert to deliver a world class pie.  The interior is almost too perfect.  I kept looking around to see if I was on a Hollywood soundstage that was built to resemble a quaint pizzeria in Naples.  Bianco is almost too perfect!  He's pounding out pizzas behind his counter with sweat and flour both clinging to his brow.  He too looks like Hollywood's image of the perfect pie guy. When something seems too good to be True it typically is, but Bianco lives up to the hype.   Is it the best pizza in the country?  No. Is it an amazing pizza that's worth waiting for? Yes.  1 Spiedini 1 Tomato Mozzarella Salad 1 Pizza 1 Beer -------------------------------------- $40",

Heard they took reservations for parties of 6 or more, so we got a group together and called. Took 2 months to get a reservation- so annoying!!  Their staff isn't overly helpful, and it took forever for our server to finally get to our table. Once he did, he was knowledgeable and friendly and service was fast after that.   We all ordered salads, mine was a house salad that was really good. Portion was just right, not too big or small. However, it was so good that once I was done I wanted more. I shared a margherita pizza with added mushrooms that was pretty good, but my friend let me try her Wise Guy pizza and that was amazing.   Not sure I have the patience to wait as long as some people did, and maybe if I had I would not have enjoyed it so much. But saving time with a reservation was worth it, and I'll go back if I have some time to kill or want to pay a little more for pizza.",

    "text": "Extremely Disappointing Experience, Especially Compared to their Town & Country Location...  I arrived at Pizzeria Bianco downtown Phoenix on Adams St. prepared for a repeat of my wonderful dining experience a week earlier at their Town & Country location on 20th St. That was not to happen...  I arrived early, just as they opened, since this location has a reputation for being very busy, and long waits to get in. By the time I left, 30 minutes later, the place was packed. Arriving when they open is apparently a sound strategy for getting seated.  I had so enjoyed my Pizza Margherita at the other location, that I was certain I would have a similar experience here. Even though the staff was busy with seating back to back arrivals at the front door, my seat at the bar proved to be a good idea as a server came to bring me water, and take my order almost immediately.   The pizza offerings here were the same as at the Town & Country location, so once again I ordered the Pizza Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) with the addition of garlic and prosciutto, understanding that prosciutto would significantly increase the cost of my pizza. As at Town & Country, I was assured that additional ingredients would not interfere with the crust being thin and crisp. I considered ordering a glass of red wine, but my server never returned, or came within \"hailing\" distance.  My pizza was brought to me by a different server after a very short wait. It didn't look quite as perfect as my pizza from the Town & Country location because this pizza had many burned areas on the edges of the crust. Before trying it, I had to cut through the prosciutto, which was apparently added after the pizza was sliced.  My bite of the first slice was not quite what I had expected or hoped for. The crust was super thin, but not quite crisp at the center as it had been at Town & Country. It was also barely warm - not even close to hot. I wondered if once it came from the oven, it had to sit and wait for someone to have time to finish it with the prosciutto and basil.   Finally reaching the edge of that first piece, it became clear to me that unlike at Town & Country, this WAS going to be one of those pizzas where part of the crust would be left on the plate - the burned part. I tried a bit of it, but it wasn't slightly charred, it was burned through on most of the edges.   Since no one came back to check on how my pizza tasted (all attention was focused on the stream of incoming diners) I made my way through a couple more cool slices, eating less and less of each slice as the burned edge was increasingly large as I worked my way around the pizza. It had turned into a pretty poor experience.  As I looked up, I saw that my check had been left for me - no offer of dessert - nothing - just an apparent indication that I should pay and relinquish my check. I got my credit card out, and placed it with the check. When the server came to get the check, he did ask if I wanted a box - but I had NO interest in taking that pizza home with me.   I would have preferred focus on the pizza preparation and service, rather than how quickly they can seat people as they walk in the door. The door seemed to be all that the staff was attentive to. This ended up being like a pizza cafeteria rather than a pizza dining experience.   My experience at Pizzeria Bianco, the original at 623 Adams in Phoenix was a complete and very expensive bust. It was a complete waste of money for a poorly executed pizza, poor service, and poor value. I would not recommend it, and will not return. I will, however, be returning to their location at Town & Country again soon.  As an aside, looking at the photos on Yelp for both locations, I see more pictures of burned crust for 623 Adams than for Town and Country.",

Their dour manner of treating their customers and behavior general lacks basic customer awareness.  Like the old Seinfeld show.... Nazis Soup Kitchen... must have been  their/ charter inspiration...we had hope for a superb place....wrong...it was freezing inside... refused to let us sit on patio where it was warm and  comfortable ...staff controls the thermostat .... just like plane and spas...  client comfort  low priority.  The crust was superb the top of the pizza was OK preparation perhaps more European then classic American... The onions were excellent... Overall rating of the pizza is a six... Clearly a pretty good pizza not worth the poor treatment ... not worth the line.....    there are many places in Phoenix Arizona with equal pizza without the discourtesy or the long wait  The bottom line is good pizza but clearly no Chicago here...sadly  Oh yes the mozzarella tomato salad was very good...",

It was simple but did not impress.  Very very light cheese, some pieces had zero.  There were four small pieces of basil and the crust was partially burnt.  I understand the wood burning oven but the burnt flavor took away the flavor in my opinion.  Just not the best for $15.  The \"green salad\" is just that.  A bunch of lettuce and light dressing.  $6  Again the service was good but in our opinion not worth the price.",

Cut to today around lunchtime and I happened to be in the area and it was open, no lines. Decided to go in and try this amazing pizza. Talk about being underwhelmed. The pizza is expensive and frankly, it's just not very good. I would believe it's very fresh and the ingredients are good, but the end result is a very so-so pizza for too much money. We ordered a total of 5 pizzas, (which are all about 12\" and 6 slices), a water, a Coke and 2 teas and the bill was $97 and change. For that kind of money,  I expect an amazing pizza.   The service was very good and they were fast and friendly, but otherwise there is no reason to go there. Of the three different pizzas I tried, none of them were exceptional in any way and no one at the table seemed to enjoy their food very much. Maybe I missed the train on this place by waiting so long, but I see no reason to go back.",

I was fortunate enough to have our local team join me for my visit so we ordered one of each of the six pies they offered.  The favorite amongst the group was the Rosa and the Biancoverde.  The Marinara was a close third.  The service was excellent and the food was spectacular.  The beer list at the main location was poor but their \"drinking cabin\" next door had great beers on tap.  They have to run over to the other building to get you the better beer.  My advice: Go on a weekday and go early.  Get there at 5:45 and the place is yours.  Avoid game days.  I can see why thus is on most top 10 pizza lists.",

The restaurant is super cute and there's even a lit patio outside. Service was good and fast. The only bummer was that you have to valet and the restaurant charges an additional $3 (not including tip) to \"validate\" parking. Validation means the restaurant pays for your parking if you buy from them so if you have to pay for it, it should be called parking FEE, not parking validation. Just my opinion, but I don't think it's proper etiquette to charge your restaurant guests for parking.",

I can't park myself and walk the extra 6 feet? I got the rosa pizza, which I would not recommend (though it was good), but the verde pizza my date ordered was delicious.

Antipasto:  Your typical fare of vegetables, cheese, and meats.  I enjoyed the squash and prosciutto-wrapped figs.  Yum!  Spiedini:  With bites of spinach to cut through the saltiness of the rich fontina cheese and prosciutto, it was almost a perfect bite.    I won't drone on about every single pizza but I will say that the Rosa was my favorite.  The Rosa pizza is just a flavor-explosion.  I love how the pistachios adds an interesting texture and who doesn't love rosemary?  Delish.  All the pizzas were beautifully charred with the perfect balance of crispiness and chewiness while the toppings were top-notch and great quality.

To my surprise my party (only 2 of us) waltzed in and sat right down.  Easy enough.  The restaurant is nice and cozy and very small.  When the weather is cooler I would expect longer waits simply on the small size of the place alone.  The pizza oven was directly behind my and I felt sorry, if only for a moment, for the two guys manning the oven.  The wood fired pizza will bake quickly.  Don't expect to wait very long.  That is one saving grace if you do happen to get stuck waiting.  Most parties should out in a timely fashion unless they decide to hang around too long after they eat.  This is the kind of place that anyone with common courtesy will depart when they are done eating.  The Bianco pie is hyped.  While it is very good I can think of two places off the top of my head that are better (neither is located here in AZ).  Based on the food alone I would normally give a place like this 4 stars but two things irk me about Pizzeria Bianco: value and selection.  You must choose from a selection of only 6 pizza varieties ranging from $12-16.  If you want to leave with a full stomach expect to order 2 or 3 pies and expect to drop some cash.  I shared a pizza with my friend.  The 3 slices rationed to me were akin to eating on slice of your standard pizza.    Service was friendly and attentive and they will validate your parking ticket if you are parked in the garage next door.  Good pie and place overall but not up to the hype.  If you can get right in, by all means, go for it but I'd wait for another day if the wait approaches the fabled hour mark.",

    "text": "As soon as I found out we were headed to Phoenix, this place was at the top of my list, the one that I  know by heart.  And I wondered of it really could be as great as I've read it is for the past few years.  It was, and truly may be the best pizza I've ever had, including ones in Naples, NYC, and Chicago.  Never mind that each of those locales has their own particular style and genre, Bianco's is just simply amazing.  The antipasto platter was fine, roasted peppers and fritatta being the best of it.  The cauliflower was vastly over roasted and swimming in oil which was disappointing but that still doesn't lower my rating.  I just wish we had ordered 2 pizzas with no \"starter\" so that our enjoyment had been further maximized.  As it was, leaving half (it is that rich and filling) of our Biancoverde was truly difficult.  If we had planned better, we could have tried the Rosa as well.  I cry a little on the inside...  That said, believe the hype, wait if there is a line, make sure you are truly hungry and find your way here.  Completely worth it!",

    "text": "After living 2 blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)    Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.    Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.    The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place.   We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.    I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.    Is it good, yes.  Is it worth the wait, nope.",

Not sure if we are able to give a fair review due to waiting 3 hours, being starving & having super high expectations. We both agreed that we would never wait 3 hours again for this place or any other restaurant for that master. It was just ridiculous. We ordered the Marguerita pizza & although we did agree that the crust was light & thin we again didn't think it was worth waiting 3 hours for.  It also seems ridiculous  that they won't seat people & serve them at the huge picnic tables outside- they could cut the wait time way down by doing that.",

I took some locals' advice and got in line about an hour ahead of opening.  Thursday, I understand is the easiest night.  Friday and Saturday are impossible.  I was seated quickly both times since I was traveling by myself - this is one instance when it is not good to have friends.  Now the first time I was at PB, I had to have the magherita (you know me, it you can't make a good magherita, you have no reason to be in business).  It was good, not as good as I've tasted in Italy but superior to most pizza.  However, the second time, I tried the wiseguy.  It was amazing.  The crust was beyond perfect - light, bubbly, but not bready.  I couldn't stop eating my pizza.  However, it could have used a lighter hand with the smoked mozzarella.  It overwhelmed the delicious onions and fennel sausage.      The best view is at the bar watching the guys craft the pizzas.  The fire undulates in the brick oven creating a hypnotic pyromaniacs fantasy.",

My #1 is Milo and Olive (dough is crisp/thin/soft) in Santa Monica, and #2 is Pizzeria Mozza (dough is crisp and thin but a bit thicker and chewier than Milo).   The Pizzeria Bianco was pretty good. It did taste different. I'm pretty sure it's because of the water. Every pizza in different parts of the country has a unique taste because of the water.   Their pizza dough has a good balance between softness, crisp, and chewy. I don't like chewy at all so I think whether or not you love this place depends on your dough texture preference.   Still, I ate the entire pizza I ordered myself. I did drive all the way from LA to find out if it was the best pizza in the country. I also got off my ephemeral no carb diet for this pizza. Worth it? Only if you happen to be in town.",

Having ate there, I can attest that it is wonderful.    It was very pleasant to sit outside on a warm evening.  The staff was attentive and helpful.  My server told me that I did not have to choose between the Sonny Boy (Salami & olives) and the Wiseguy.  The wood-roasted onion and fennel sausage on the Wiseguy were flavorful.  Because I was by myself, I thought about leaving the crusts but they were too chewy and yeasty to discard.  The farmer's market salad was fresh and crisp and the beer selection is small but well curated.",

    "text": "We came on a Saturday at 1pm for a party of two and had to wait for about 30 minutes (although they originally said our wait was going to be 45 minutes). They have valet parking for $5. They send you a text with a link that tells you your place in line so you can walk around while you wait.  I always prefer thinner crust over thicker crust but there's also a chance that the pizza crust burns if it's even cooked a little bit longer. Our pizzas were a bit burnt but it wasn't too bad.  WISEGUY ($19) - One of their most popular pizzas. It does not have sauce in it which makes it really interesting. I love the crunchiness of the onion and then the random sausage when I bite into it. I think I would've preferred if the sausage and onion pieces were smaller and more spread out so I can take a little bit of each in every bite. It's a different kind of pizza than you're probably used to. 4/5  SONNY BOY ($19) - Another issue about thinner pizzas is that with sauce the pizza itself may be soggy. That's how it was like with this so it was a little flimsy to grab. It was still really good though since I love meat. 4/5  Overall, a good place to stop by and grab a pizza as it's close to a lot of attractions like the Arizona Science Center and Heritage Square.",

My boyfriend's dad insisted we go when he came to visit for the weekend (since he loved it last time when he visited a year ago), and I'm so so glad we did.   The house salad was fresh but nothing special. I will say that the olives were the least objectionable green olives I've ever had. Now to the pizza... it was SO GOOD. And I'm not even really a pizza person. It was crunchy and chewy all at the same time. I got the Wise Guy, s/o got the Margherita, and his dad got the Sonny Boy. All of these pizzas were delectable. I thought mine was the best. Although I'm not typically a white pizza (no tomato sauce) kind of person, I thought that the lack of sauce gave my pizza a greater depth of flavor. I got to enjoy the fired taste of the crust, the sweetness of the onions, and the magic of the fennel sausage. Mmmmmmm, I should not have written this review while hungry...",

There was also a University of Phoenix graduation so that might be why. We walked around the whole block because it was the Heritage Square and our wait being a little less than half an hour, thank the pizza gods!!   I got the wiseguy and the bf got the sonny boy. The sever will tell but note that the wiseguy does NOT have sauce. I still liked it better than the sonny boy because for me it was a little too saucy. The taste of the sausage was prominent in each bite. I really wished that they cut the onions in smaller pieces so that I could have it in every bite rather than one long string that is gone way too soon.   All in all, I'd recommend it if you've got a hankering for pizza. I wasn't particularly impressed with their apps and desserts.",

Between the 3 of us the two pizzas were quickly devoured, we probably could have easily done one more but we wanted to get dessert.  I never thought I would say this but the arugula on the pizza was really good, it somehow balanced the other light flavors really well.   As others have mentioned- this pizza is made of really high quality ingredients and this is apparent from the very first bite. The crust is crispy but very light and flavorful!!   Easily a top 5 pizza spot ever. If you're in town, don't miss it! The beer selection was nice too, got to try some local brews!   I'm curious to try the pistachio next!",

Owing to the odd hour, there was no wait at all. We ordered two pizzas, a margherita and a Rosa. Both were cooked appropriately, with the correct amount of char. The dough crisp on the exterior yet chewy on the inside, with a wheat, nutty sweetness. Salted perfectly as well. Really just an incredible specimen. The margherita's sauce was, in my opinion, a little too raw/fresh tasting, though otherwise it had no obvious defects, and was made from quality tomatoes. The cheese was quite good, and some browning improved the flavor. The basil was standard but fresh and flavorful and entirely appropriate. 4.5 Stars. Both pizzas shared the same crust, so I need not describe it again. The Rosa was interesting mix of flavors, and quite good at that. The rosemary really tied the whole thing together without being overpowering.   Additionally, the local IPA I had was clean and hoppy.  And lastly, the service was excellent. Would love to return next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Yelp directed us towards Pizzeria Bianco and although I have no other pizza in Phoenix to compare it to, I'd recommend eating there.  We decided to try out two pizzas among the four of us: the margherita pizza and the biancoverde. The margherita pizza was delicious; just what I would expect from a quality pizza joint. The biancoverde on the other hand wasn't quite my cup of tea. There was a strong flavor in the pizza that threw me off, but I should mention that two of the others in the group loved it. I think I just wasn't a fan of one of the cheeses on it so I can't knock them for that. The only small quarrel I have overall is with the crust; it was a little too thin and crispy for preference, but that didn't take away from the tasty pizza experience.  Overall, Pizzeria Bianco provides great artisanal pizza so it doesn't surprise me that it's acquired the reputation that it has in Phoenix. I'm certainly a fan!",

We sat at the bar and had a nice local draft beer and the house Pinot Grigio, both great. The had Dragoon IPA and Wren House Kolsch on draft. We started with the farmers market salad and the caprese, both were very fresh and tasted great. For pizza we got a Sonny Boy (red sauce with salami and olives) and half of the Biancoverde and Rosa. Both pizzas were really good. We even ate the crust. We ended the meal with the rice pudding but it was just average. Overall the experience was excellent.",

The bartender advised me to get 1/2 of their 2 most popular and it was a great choice. I very much enjoyed my meal. Large detractors were the wait-the food is really good, but the fact that they have out door seating as large as the main restaurant and don't seat it is stupid. Also they don't have enough help. The staff was great and very knowledge-but they were running around like the possessed. They need more staff to handle everything. Now I did come in at an off time but it still speaks to a great idea poorly executed based on how the food was delivered.   Had they taken care of the few issues I easily could rate this higher.",

I called the restaurant the next day to notify them and I asked for a refund as we had ordered double the amount of pizza so we had leftovers for the next day and I had to throw them all out. The restaurant did not refund me instead offered me a gift card. Eating a second time at the same restaurant that gave me food poisoning did not seem like a good solution to the problem. The staff did not seem very concerned or sympathetic to the situation nor interested in solving the problem of their food safety. As a customer and medical provider, I would not recommend going here.",

After the 4 of us ordered  two bottles of wine and 3 pizzas we decided we wanted one more pizza, which we ordered while still eating pizza #3. The waiter said , \"OK, but this is the last call.\" In other words, the waiter told us we had been there long enough and it was time to leave even though we were continually ordering food and wine. And to make matters worse the same waiter told us we needed to be \"more thoughtful of others who were waiting for a table.\" Do you have a per person quota of pizzas  per hour?

I ordered 5 pizzas based on previous Yelp reviews, Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy. It was a great sampling of pizzas and perfect for a group of 7. The crust was of the thin variety but soft and tasty. All toppings were awesome, everyone was satisfied. Great for dinner, great food, nice decor and great service! Wholeheartedly recommend!!!",

    "text": "This place is just heavenly, it's a small restaurant with maybe 40 chairs inside and about 20 outside. With usually long long long lines to get a table. I've waited 2 hours before for a seat at the bar, yes it is that good. On this occasion I must have hit a sweet spot, because at 7 PM on a Tuesday night the place was  1/2 full and the bar seating was empty. I waked in and was worried it was closed. Thankfully it was not, just a lull between the storms of guests I guess. By the time I left an hour later it was packed and people were waiting for a seat.  In any event I started out with an organic salad topped with blue cheese, bacon and house made croutons with a light vinaigrette. It was incredibly fresh, tasty and yummy and got my tummy yearning for my pizza. Sure I could have dined on pizza alone, but hey I need my greens and vegetables.  Secondly I had the ever popular \"wiseguy\" pizza. All their pizza's come in one size and can easily be shared with your best buddy, if you like to share. Or like in my case take half home and eat it for breakfast in the morning. The \"wiseguy\" is a very simple yes incredibly delicious white pizza, with fennel sausage, caramelized onions and very thinly sliced fresh mozzarella. Because the crust is so thin it stays supper crisp and the ingredients get to shine. It's hard to describe why this pizza is so so good, but it just is. I think between getting a pizza with only three toppings on homemade fresh dough, made the way it is in New York has a lot to do with it. The cheese just adheres to the dough and creates this cheese skin that the other topping just stick to. Add that to the char that the wood fired oven creates on the dough, and you have pizza perfection. Plain and simple.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place because of the years of hype I have heard about this place. I guess that is what happens when a place is over hyped, they just don't measure up when you finally get to the experience...  First off Id like to mention my experience was not off to a good start. The hostess was on her phone chatting about what to do that evening and saw I was walking up to her. But she waited Til the very last second of me approaching her to get off her phone to greet me. And I mean I could have put my arms on top of the podium last second to greet me! And I'd like to think it was the restaurant orders and not her bad judgement, in which case the restaurant should take note of it! But she told me to walk in and take any table id like because it was slow. I would like a courtesy walk to my table by a hostess if I were in a decent restaurant. It's just the nice thing to do. Take note of that pizza Bianco. It wasn't like the place was so crowded she couldn't rush back to greet the next guests. She obviously was under worked and probably over paid.  Onto the restaurant. I loved how the pizza making station was out on the floor. Ambiance was nice, servers were quick and friendly and greeted me, unlike the hostess.  And the food... I ordered half fennel and half salami. For me, a good crust makes the pizza for me. And here, it just failed to impress. My crust though textured nice and chewy how I like it was nothing more than that. The outer crust was burnt and tasted like cigarette ash because it was that burnt! And the middle was so soggy that water ran down the tip when I picked it up. I had to practically slide the slice off the plate and into my mouth to eat it and then liquid dropped off onto the plate! That first bite just set the unimpressionable taste for the rest of the pizza. The least they could have done for a $18 pizza was add a little more dough in the middle. That's the cheapest part of making a pizza. I'm not asking for more meats or mozzarella. Just a little tiny bit thicker dough so the middle isn't a soup party. How do people like that shit?!   On the positive side tho, besides their terrible crust, I did like the fine quality ingredients they did include on the pizza. The smoked mozzarella tasted great and the fennel and salami was tasty as well. Tho the salami was on the saltier side and I think they could have added more mozzarella tho because I had many red spots on my pizza which was not appetizing... And also I liked that as I left the restaurant, everyone working there said good bye and thank you for dining with them. That was nice.  I am shocked to hear that so many national reviews stated this as the nations best pizza place! I think the people who enjoy this place must enjoy cigarettes and don't mind the taste of a burnt soggy pizza in their mouth. But I for one have enjoyed better fire pit pizzas with similar crusts made by pizza shops who understand my dislike for a soggy centered pizza. I'm glad I tried this place and could eat here again if someone took me here but I personally would not choose or ask to eat here again. I've had better pizzas.  I've tried many pizza places in my life, in every town I have visited. Pizza is my absolute favorite food in the world and I can appreciate Chicago style, New York style, I don't discriminate. But what I do not like is soggy burnt pizza, and this place is just that. No thanks. If you enjoy this type of pizza minus the burnt and soggy crust (though made with a similar dough), you must try gjelina in Los Angeles. They make their pizzas right. Not so burnt where you must pick black bubbles off the pizza, but also middle is thick enough to support their many ingredients but still very thin. They also have a variety of ingredients, more so than this place.",

    "text": "What is hype. Hype is that thing that is yelpers go crazy for. The latest and greatest. The thing that has to be tried to believed. This was one of those places. I had heard that it was gonna be some of the best pizza I'd ever had. With that and the multitude of positive yelp reviews I had to try it for myself.   We pulled into the valet and handed off the keys. When we walked in I realized how small the place was. Maybe 30 people can fit in total. We saw the hostess and were told that the wait for our part of 3 would be a hour 30. We were then told that they had a wine bar next door we could wait at. The review for the bar is separate but suffice to say I liked it. When our time had come someone came and let us know that we were up. We had to sit at the bar but at least we were in.   We sat down at the bar bringing our drink for the previously mentioned bar. Now I'll new brief with the actual review.   Service was 2 stars. - place settings weren't set when we arrived. We had to ask for silver after our salad had already arrived. Our waiter seemed to be in a hurry through everything including pouring our wine which we had been pacing out for the last two hours.   Food was 2 stars.  - it was good. We had the biancoverde and the wise guy. We did the wise guy with no olives and added sausage. The food came out really fast but wasn't really out of the oven hot. Was just kind of warm. Now I'm not a local so I'm not sure what the choices are like in the area but I wasn't blown away. It was good. I just wanted more.   Ambience was 3 - small place with a bar. You can see them prepping the pizzas and putting it in the oven.  I wanted more from something rated so highly.    Bottom-line.  If your with a group of friends and wanna bring a pack of cards so you can play something at the wine bar they stick you at while you wait your 2 hours then come here.",

I love the pizza, the atmosphere, the service. It's great! I have rarely waited more than 15 minutes to be seated even though it's always busy and the space is small -- it probably helps that I enjoy sitting at the bar and there is never more than 2 people to seat.   The servers are nice and allow you to split the pizza into half white sauce/half red sauce and the toppings are SO GOOD.  Also, I always get the local greens and the olives they put on the side are so so so tasty -- would go just for the olives.  If you're in the area, eat here!",

My good friend and I stumbled upon this place after a long day in the Arizona Science museum. You literally walk outside of the museum and there it is! So convenient! Especially since we were all hungry. We chose to sit outdoors and enjoy the beautiful outdoor seating area, the kids had plenty of room to run around while we enjoyed a glass of wine and waited for our food...SCORE! We had the farm salad (arugula, fresh pear and Gorgonzola), fresh mozzarella/tomato salad and kids stuck to a margherita fresh basil pizza and a pepperoni combination pizza. Everything was delicious! We will be coming back for sure.",

Hanny's downtown is priced better, nicer serving staff, and a much nicer place to eat. Red Devil is better too.  Who cares about \"quaint\" when you sit on wooden chairs and old tables....",

Perfect amount of crispness as an exterior, and the inside was just the right amount of chewiness.   We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The red sauced sonny boy was my personal favorite with salami and pickled olives. The meat was definitely exceptional. You can taste the quality of where that meat has been, and the olives were definitely not your run of the mill. Their sauce was a good balance: slightly sweet which is how i like it.   The Wiseguy I was a little less impressed with, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white pizza. It was still very good, don't get me wrong, and one thing i really liked about it were the caramelized onions as toppings.",

I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. Bianco lacks customer service, size and comfort. The menu is limited and additions seem too costly for such small portions.       Needless to say, we ordered one pizza and that came down to exactly two slices each. Which still left us with traces of hunger after consuming the margherita with added sausage and mushrooms. To top it all off we felt like it lacked a certain kick, it was just too simple. A pizza too simple? Yeah, I'm not kidding. The service was sub-par, with a ditsy girl sitting us down and then a server that after taking our order, and bringing it over, was nowhere to be found after, we even had to ask a different server to bring us additional drinks.      Finally, the size, this place is cute but tiny, it gets uncomfortably busy and tight inside. I'm okay with closeness and all, but this was just too much that the table next to us kept dropping into our conversation. All we wanted was to enjoy our food and time there. Overall, It was a rather strange and unexpected experience .       Thankfully, we had The Rose and Crown a few steps away to unwind after such experience!!                                                            -See ya never Bianco.",

The salami and gaeta olives were a tremendous flavor combo and it was literally inhaled w only a few skid marks on the plate as evidence that it ever showed up.

I ordered the wise guy, half sauce, lets start with the sauce.  Spray painted on, and an up charge, couldn't taste the difference with or without, no flavor from the sauce I expect a nice zesty flavor nothing here.  On to toppings, quite a bit of onions, a drive by of cheese, basically another spray paint of cheese, and a few pieces of sausage.  Wow so under performing!  I paid for bread at $18.50 this is an $8-10 pizza anywhere, the amount of toppings on this, pizza this is a $6 pie.  I don't understand the pricing here, I paid for crust!

    "text": "I have never been able to eat at this place so I can't rate the food but I can rate TRYING to eat here, something I have done twice without success.  The place needs to add a \"Pizza Garden\" outdoor area or start taking reservations.  The no reservations thing is simply asinine on the part of the restaurant owner and shows great disrespect for me and my time.  Certainly plenty of people have made this complaint and the arrogant owner is not listening.    The first time we tried to eat at this place was a few years ago.  I heard the hype and decided to try it.  We arrived and were treated to a snobby hostess telling us there was an hour's wait.  We were hungry but we tried to wait it out.  After 90 minutes, we gave up.  We were hungry and getting bored.  There is only so much small talk to be made.    Hoping that the reason for the rudeness and long wait the previous time was a fluke, I tried calling for reservations.  I was told they don't do that in a very snooty way.  Undaunted, because we wanted to try this alleged best pizza, I and my party decided to go down and survive the wait.  This time it wasn't just me and my spouse it was my brother and his wife as well.  We were greeted curtly and told there was a 45 minute wait.  Again we braved the 45 minutes and then complained.  Our complaint was not well received and the bitchy attitude I got from the hostess made me re-think my desire to ever eat here.  We left.  This place may know how to make pizza (I will never know) but they sure don't know how to provide good service or listen to the customers.",

We went for a late lunch.  Small place, very warm inside and the service was very spotty.  We tried the Wiseguy, the Margherita and the Bianco Verde.  So I need to ask, how do you burn the heck out of the pizza where the 'very thick crust' looks and tastes like charcoal and the rest of the pizza is limp and still dough like?  This pizza never stood a chance with all the hype surrounding it.  I am sorry to say, however the only taste I got from the crust was very burnt charcoal.   Along with the price associated for the quality, this has much to be desired.  There are much better mom and pop shops that know how to prep, cook and present a pizza all while giving great customer service.  However, Pizzeria Bianco is not one of them.",

Service was good although it could be a bit more professional/polished given the prices of this place. Parking was valet for $5. We came just before the dinner rush so we were seated right away at the heated patio which provided great ambiance. According to some posted pictures some other yelpers seem to confuse this location with the other location. This place only serves PIZZA and like 4 dessert items. The wine prices are ridiculous, so next time I will opt for a soft drink. I chose a simple cheese pizza so I'd have a chance to properly judge the crust, sauce and cheese. I really enjoyed my pizza, it had fresh basil leaves on top. Does it taste like the pizza in Italy I grew up on and adore? No. No matter what or where you go, this just cannot be duplicated but I can see myself coming back here sometime. I also really enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla sauce as dessert. Definitely a very pricey dinner!",

To reduce the wait time, we took the first available table which, not surprisingly, was outside (ugh - would not do that again with temperatures in the low 50's and no sun on the table).   We ordered 5 of the 6 pizzas listed on the menu (all of them except the Marinara - no cheese on that one!).      It's clear the ingredients are high quality (the arugula on the Biancoverde was amazing!)  but all 3 of us (yes 5 pizzas for 3 of us - we wanted to try them all) agreed we would not necessarily come back.

We ordered a Margherita Pizza with fennel sausage and mushrooms for what struck us as an outrageous $24. It was good wood fired pizza, with a thin crust and fresh ingredients but scarcely bigger than many individual pizzas I have had. The flavors were nice but not outstanding and I agree with another reviewer who found it somewhat bland. The \"best pizza\" - sorry I think not. The service was acceptable but not great. At those prices we shouldn't have to ask to have our water glasses refilled. There is valet parking which adds another $5. I won't be going out of my way to come back.",

Pizzeria Bianco kept coming up and I had it on the list but was hesitant since I'm from New York and an admittedly a bit of a \"pizza snob\" haha. This ended up being the perfect storm. It was 3 minutes away from Chase Field, where we were going after the game, and then when I googled \"best pizzerias in the United States\", I was blown away. USA Today had it as #3 and two other lists had it in the top 10. And guess what? It did not disappoint! At all! The Wiseguy was incredible (we added mushrooms to it which were out of this world good). The ambience and decor were inviting and cozy. And the best part? We walked right in and sat right down and had our pizza within 15 minutes.  I was afraid of the wait time given everything I had read, and granted this was a Tuesday evening, but it wasn't an issue at all. Overall, I highly highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco. It was everything advertised and so much more. This pizza snob and his partner were both highly impressed.",

The crust IS delicious and the outside of it puffs up etc...it simply seems to lack a bit of chewiness along with the outside crunch,.  The ingredients are good though as is the sauce.

    "text": "Well, we were downtown last weekend and happened to be hungry at an odd hour due to a very late breakfast that morning and so immediately I thought \"Hey, lets go to Pizzeria Bianco. They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday.\" Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it.  Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there.  I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return.",

I even had 3 glasses of wine which usually curbs my appetite. I had bread. I sampled all our sides(roasted garlic, prosciutto, and the caprese salad.)

The Biancoverde was my second fave...the arugula compliments and balances the creaminess. Margherita tasted good, but too safe for me.  The Rosa I couldn't get enough of. I had 2 slices there, and another as soon as I woke up the next day.  A cold slice of pizza.  And I don't do cold pizza EVER.    Bianco lived up to the hype.  Bravo!  Please open a location in LA.",

People who claimed it was the best pizza in the world, and who had traveled to Phoenix on occasion specifically for the pie. Having recently moved to AZ, but being born and bred in NY myself, I was a bit skeptical. Best Pizza ever? In Phoenix?  C'mon, anybody who knows anything knows the best pizza is greasy cheesy NY thin crust. It's something in Manhattan's water that just makes it perfect, right?   Well, my sister and her husband and I went for dinner after a long day of hiking in Sedona. We each ordered a different pizza so we could share and try as much as possible. I got the Rosa with salami added, sis got the classic margharita, and brother in law got the wiseguy (the one that I thought sounded the best). All of them were awesome, though I really liked the Rosa. It had the most amazing combination of rich and hearty tastes and you could tell, in all three, the ingredients were fresh and high quality.   Verdict? Best pizza EVER?  Well...i'm admittedly biased and probably  predisposed to what i grew up with, but you could certainly do a lot worse. However, without a doubt, Pizzeria Bianco does earn  the title for Best Pizza in Phoenix.",

    "text": "This place is good, very good, but it was overhyped for me.  I have seen them on several \"Best of\" lists, and was excited to finally get a chance to try them when working in Phoenix.  The pizza is classic Neopolitan and very good as they were one of the first ones to offer this style since 1994, so I give them great props for that.  There are just now so many others offering similar styled pizza with unique and more flavorful crust offerings.  If I hadn't been to so many other places (see my pizza list), I would probably give them 4 stars.  I came on a Tuesday night when there were no sporting events nearby, so it wasn't too crowded, which was nice.  The parking is a little strange as when you turn into the street directed by your GPS, it dead-ends into the park near the restaurant.  Fortunately they have a valet guy that will take your car for a reasonable cost of $3.  I tried the margherita pizza with sausage and it was flavorful, and the crust was nice and chewy.  I was disappointed that they only offered one of the Four Pointe brews on tap in the restaurant (the lighter one), but the Bar Bianco next door had at least four drafts.  Tip to remember for next time is to go next door to order your beer and then bring it in (I think they allow that since they are same ownership.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco! Delizioso!  The pizza here... Like nothing I've tried. The restaurant setting... so cool and hip yet romantic and city-like. I'm glad to say us Phoenicians have this local spot, which is located in the Heritage Square in DT Phx. I always love going to the DT Phx area and trying this place out just topped off the mood of the evening for my date and I! I saw this area while at the Matsuri Festival back in February, and I told myself I wanted to come back to sit on the patio of one of the restaurants in Heritage Square... When my date brought me here, I had no idea the location.   They have fun lights that string across the patio connected to the actual restaurant building. It's the perfect spot on a perfect-weathered day, especially at night when those twinklies light up the area out front. The hostess was pretty friendly, halfway wheeling around on a scooter thing, looking like she had a broken leg - but that didn't stop her, she was full of energy! We were greeted by our server who was very helpful and friendly. He recommended a few pizzas to try and brought us some bread with our waters. I ordered a Moscato (as usual lately) that was just perfectly sweet and buttery with a tiny hint of bubbly. My date ordered a \"Very Dry\" Ginger Ale that came in a glass bottle that I've never heard of, and it was exactly as described... Very dry! But still very good if you like Ginger Ale!  We ordered the Handmade Mozzarella Salad that went great with the Sonny Boy pizza. The salad being not too overpowering really brought out the taste and flavors in the pizza! And who can go wrong with some greenery eats in their life?? The server was on top of everything, filling up empty water glasses and checking up on us. Come time to wrap things up, we didn't have room for dessert and the server was prepared just in case and placed our check down for us to pay. The price was very reasonable considering I also ordered a glass of wine. Our pizza was boxed up and ready to go by the time we paid and we didn't have to wait forever.  Overall, with the ambiance, good food, great location?.... These guys will definitely see me again!  Update: The leftover pizza I was able to reheat a few days later and still was so delish :)",

Ours were not even good pizzas, let alone exceptional. And for two regular beverages, a small appetizer and two pizzas we paid $92 including tip. I just think they're coasting on the momentum of their own past success at this point. And what's with that distracting oak smoke flavored crust? Not good.

Anyway, we spent the hottest day of the year (118 are you freaking kidding me?!) at the Science Center. I thought, ok PB is next door and there is no line, so we went for it.  It was about 4:45 and the place was practically empty! So the 6 of us rolled in and were seated immediately. Fabulous.  The menu is simple. Love that. We ordered the salad, roasted garlic pizza, margherita pizza, the Rosa, and the chocolate flourless cake.  Oh my stars. The food is excellent. What more can be said after 800+ reviews? My favorite was the Rosa pizza. Carmalized red onion, pistachios, rosemary...now I'm not a pizza expert (like I am with cupcakes and coffee lol), but this was probably the best pizza I've ever had. And I can't believe I'm saying that since I've traveled all over, and the best pizza ends up in my own backyard?   Chocolate flourless cake was also the bomb. So fudgy and rich and dense. So good!  Service was excellent too. Maybe because we were only  1 of 3 tables, but still. Food came out super fast, waters refilled, nice chit chat with the server about the owner Chris and the concept of the restaurant...I mean the whole experience from start to finish was perfect.  Great spot. Now, I would never wait for hours and hours. Just come for lunch or between lunch and dinner. But if you absolutely have to wait, it's worth it :)  Can't wait to come back!",

I start with their simple organic greens salad and olives for the table. Their olives are to die for, I LOVE the bright green ones, in fact, sometimes I ask for ONLY the bright green kind! Their Antipasto is always a winner and is different according to what is in season. Their grilled fresh veggies + EVOO really can't be beat. For pizza, honestly, i've had them all and have loved every single one. But my FAVORITE is Biancoverde, add prosciutto. The only downside about Pizzeria Bianco is that it is very small and there can be a long wait so definitely come prepared to hang out in their adorable wine bar next door {sometimes there is even live music!}.

The ingredients are good. The pizza was burnt (you can use fire, but don't burn my pizza!)   I think the prices (average $16) for a pizza was high for what you get. I left hungry and rushed to get out. The staff wasn't very personable to our table of 3 so I didn't feel obligated to tip.   All in all I was disappointed because of the hype.

I admit I was so worried about getting a table especially when walking up and seeing how small and intimate the place was! Phew! Got a table within a couple of mins! They are quick at turning those tables! Service was great, we were greeted and given water right as we sat down. The menu gives you an option for any craving. I wanted to keep it simple with the MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil. As many reviews will tell you the pizza dough is really out of this world! To be honest, the entire pizza was out of this world. All the ingredients are so fresh, you can really taste the difference. What's nice about Pizzeria Bianco is that they have a garden area, I'm sure a lot of things are picked right there! They have outdoor seating which I'm sure is lovely at night when the weather is a little cooler.",

An entire year has passed since then and somehow I never got around to trying it. I had a visitor last weekend from California who was really keen to try this place and that's how I finally dragged my lazy ass here. The place itself is quite small but it adds to its unique, quaint quality. We went in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and we were seated right away. They do have a $5 valet service right outside, which makes it super convenient.   I started with a glass of Cabernet, which was quite great. We decided to get one half Rosa and the other half Sonny Boy. Our server warned us that Rosa does not have any sauce on it but I wanted to try it anyway. I mean, pistachios on pizza is a ridiculous sounding idea.. bordering on crazy. Thankfully, it tasted anything but ridiculous. This has gotta be one of the most unique things I've ever tried. Chopped up pistachios, delicate rings of red onions, a hint of rosemary and Parmigiano-Reggiano baked to delicious perfection.. lord have mercy! The other half was nothing short of spectacular. There was ample salami on the pizza and I was a happy camper! We were both very pleased with our meal and left with a big smile. Highly recommended!",

I've heard nothing but amazing things, and have read plenty of foodie articles claiming this is the best pizza ever. You can't ask about pizza in the Phoenix area without Pizzeria Bianco in the picture. That being said...this place is way smaller than I anticipated, but so cute! Thankfully we came at the right time and had no wait. Our waitress was very nice, and our food came out in no time. We got the local salad with red wine vinaigrette and the margherita pizza. Both were delicious, but the only thing I would say is that the pizza seemed pretty soggy in the middle, even when it first got to us. All in all, great food and great atmosphere. I would come back again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",

Both delivered and I found myself wanting more once we finished our slices. The crust is thin, crisp, and airy with a good proportion of sauce and toppings (Gaeta olives, salami).

Now the menu is very simple and consists  of 4-5 varieties of pizza and 3 salads.  They do have a full bar with several local craft beers on draft.  There is not much seating so be prepared to wait if you go during peak hours.  The service is very good and it was impressive how the staffed worked together so well.  The pizzas are right in between 1 or 2 servings depending on your appetite.  I would recommend splitting a pie for lunch and going solo for dinner.

We walked in a few minutes after opening so it was relatively quiet.  We were quickly seated and offered menus.  The guy helping us was nice but for whatever reason, he gave us zero time to decide what to order. Not quite literally but it felt like he took a step back, got something for another table and came right back to us.   For starters, we went with the spiedini which ended up being more of a salady thing.  It was tasty nonetheless.  But it made me crave more proscuitto!  Then we got two pizzas.  (Note:  The selection was surprisingly small...I think about 6-7 pizzas?).  We decided on the Sonny Boy and the Biancoverde.  I LOVE the suggestion the guy gave us when he served up the pies - let the Sonny Boy cool a little but eat the Biancoverde hot.    Verdict?  The pizzas were good. Not out of this world good but glad we came good.  I did have a problem with how burnt our pizzas were, to the point that it was bitter to eat certain slices, especially the Sonny Boy.  I'm familiar with wood fired pizzas and they don't have to be that burnt to be authentic or tasty.  Final note: Their bread service is fantastic.  It was all I could do not to eat the entire basket before our pizza came.  Anyway, glad we tried it!",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco, one of the most iconic pizza places in Arizona. After living in the Valley for almost 5 years I finally paid a trip to the original location last night. My wife and I arrived around 4:45pm and to my surprise we were seated right away at an outside table. The server was friendly and we ordered two pizzas. I had the margherita. Overall, this was a good pizza. Was it the best pizza I've ever eaten? No. I have heard amazing things about Bianco ever since I've moved to AZ and I don't necessarily disagree with the fact that it's very quality pizza, but I have had better. The crust was extremely light and crispy, the sauce had a good pure tomato flavor. However, the pizza would have benefited from some more mozzarella. I wish that the crust had a slight more chewiness to it. I think that Pizzeria Bianco is a classic Neopolitan style pizza place that was probably one of the first of its kind here. However, just because it was the first doesn't mean its the best. I would recommend checking it out as it is a very nice restaurant in a cool area of downtown PHX. See for yourself, and then you can determine where it ranks in your pizza list.",

It was some time after 8pm, I don't know exactly when- we had been at a show at the planetarium next door that ended at 8. Maybe it was as late as 8:30. Given the reputation of pizzeria, that is a short wait. We joined friends waiting for us at Bar Bianco, where the plan was drinks and snacks until it was our turn, then we would split up, as our friends had already dined before the planetarium show. Midway through my drink, we were called for our reservation, in person- a few minutes before nine. I don't think a half hour had passed.  I asked if they could take whoever was next on the list, we were not ready. I was told there were no more people on the list, and that summer hours, they close at nine. Here it was, my chance to dine at Pizzeria Bianco! But having worked in a restaurant in my youth, I know what it's like to have to stay in a kitchen at closing time, and I was still mid-drink, and I'm also disabled and was going to be riding a scooter over to the Pizzeria. So I politely apologized and asked the host if it was okay if I forfeited the reservation so the kitchen staff could start shutting down and get an earlier night off, and I would return another night? He said it was okay and smiled. No attitude. I actually gave up a shot at a Bianco Pizza. For now. But they were so nice about it!",

I think the pizza was good but it may have been overhyped, and I was there with two NY/NJ natives who have tendencies to get offended by non NY pizza.   We came for a late lunch at 3 so there were many open tables. We got the caprese salad and two pizzas which was the perfect afternoon meal for us. The caprese was extremely fresh. The pizzas came with a fantastic woodsy aroma and good taste. I was a little disappointed that the crust had a GIANT burnt crust bubble in one of the 8 slices which made the slice inedible.  The service was prompt and we were close to the pizza oven and got to see some action. We reheated the leftovers the next day for breakfast but it wasn't as delicious.",

    "text": "All the prices you will find for pizzeria Bianco menu items online are conveniently listed less expensively than they are in the restaurant.   If you question the staff about the price discrepancies ($4+ difference for The margarita pizza for example) they will swarm you like African killer bees!   I was continually told that my search on Google and Yelp and other easily accessible search engines were out of their control and there was nothing they could do about it.   When I mentioned how easy it was to suggest edits to these inaccuracies, they proceeded to degrade me by calling me \"buddy\" \"dude\" \"man\" \"bro\" and using quite a aggressive tone when I did not reciprocate such a manner.  Now, about the pizza... It's good. If you've traveled much, and tried pizzas around the country and even around the world, as I have, you will find this pizza to be unworthy of the price, the wait, or the interaction with the rude staff.   I'd absolutely never eat here again. I tried it 10 years ago and had the same experience. I decided to try to get out of convenience, but lesson learned! The shame is on me.  Also, do not try to place an to-go order over the phone. Even when you tell them you are walking to the restaurant, and you are in a rush, I need to save five or 10 minutes, they will take no mercy. They will just tell you \" we don't do that. You will have to come in.\"  Well, at least I can appreciate the consistency of this restaurant. It's not about you, it's about them.",

They have a sign outside that says \"wait here to be seated\". Phoenix heat this time of year, you really don't want to be waiting outside anywhere, but I did anyway. Comes out, I tell her im waiting for more people, tells me she can't give me a table until they arrive, turns around and almost shuts the door on my face. I grab the door as its shutting on my face and tell her; im going to wait inside, its very hot. She immediately replies to go stand in that corner, I can't have you in the middle of the restaurant (yeah, like that was my plan all along). I sit at the bar grab a drink. The rest of the party arrives a few minutes later, they walk in and she immediately tells them to walk outside and wait until the table is ready. Didn't feel a warm fuzzy feeling for this place and the food is just ok. No reason to go back. You would think because they have the more than 6 person 20% mandatory tip policy, that you would get better service, but I guess what that means to them is \"we are entitled to 20% gratuity, and service is not really what you will get in exchange, since you disrupted how our tables were set before you interrupted us, that 20% only covers us pushing tables together\"",

    "text": "Ok, as much as I want to give this place 5 stars.... I just can't. The wait is just too ridiculous. So I think this place plays psychological tricks on it's patrons. People have to wait so long that they either go get drunk or get so hungry that the food tastes amazing once you finally get it..... plus people need to justify the wait. But alas, I have fallen for their tricks. We got there at 4:45 and had to park in the garage which has validation ,but not complete validation, it still costs 5$ (Lame!). We found the restaurant by looking for a mob of people. We got in the 30 min line to put our name on the waiting list... whoa. When we got up to the front we found out the wait would be 3.5 hours, but at least we didn't have to stay the whole time. I think that is the best possible thing this business has done. If I had to sit there for 3 hours, I would not have been a happy camper, but we went to Body World and came back and only had to wait 15 min, so that was great. Also our wait wasn't really 3.5 hours, it was more like 2 hours 45 min. Whatever. So we got some drinks at the bar and then got called in to a table. The waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait, so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it's customers unlike a different restaurant I recently went to *cough*postino*cough* There were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas. We got the roasted veggies with cheese and sopprasetta (sp?) and the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. They were both amazing!! This was the best part of the meal. The veggies included purple cauliflower, carrots, squash, asparagus, sunchokes, and olives. They were sooo good. Roasted and kind of sweet. These were some of the best veggies I have had. Also the cheese, I don't remember what kind it was, was so creamy... it tasted great on bread. However, nothing touched the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. I have not had prosciutto before because I don't like bacon.   Yes, I don't like bacon.  But I was being so closed minded because prosciutto is delicious. And this was especially good, it could have only been better if there were more of it. The BF and I ordered the biancoverde and our friends got the wiseguy. I didn't try theirs, but our was very good. It was garlicky, but the flavor was more subtle than it usually is. The three cheeses were great and the arugula tasted very fresh.   So the problems include: long wait and no dessert. Why doesn't this place have dessert? (oh except for biscotti... biscotti is a weak dessert choice). The rest was good and if someone were to invite me to go back, I would, but I probably wouldn't go back on my own.",

I have eaten pizza all over the US and throughout Italy, so I have a basis for comparison. Honestly, I don't even see how Bianco gets into the conversation. As an example, it was no better than the pizza at Ciao Napoli in Chicago or Tutta Bella in Seattle (and I didn't wait anywhere close to 3 hours at either of those places).

There's no kids menu, which is just odd to me. Even high ends restaurants have that plus maybe a couple crayons with a placemat to color on. Then we ordered waters, and they brought the kids tiny glass Pilsners filled to the brim with water and no lid. The floor is also hard surface. Toddler + water + glass + concrete floor = seriously? Has no one that has ever worked for this establishment birthed a child? Ok, I know what you're thinking. Don't bring your kids to a swanky place. It's was 11am on a weekday, and you're a pizza place so be for real. I'm from the East coast; pizza isn't posh. It's pizza. Lastly, the second they brought our check you could see the hostess type lady literally standing there eyeballing us. Give me a second, lady. Back off. It was irritating at best. The pizza was very good. The salads can not really be an entree as there's nothing to them, and one of them is \"market price\" but it was literally a garden salad with croutons. I think they think they are more awesome than they are, which is probably True for a pizza place in AZ. Lastly, I just want to say both children were very well behaved that day, so it wasn't that our kids were buttholes. However, even if they were buttholes it doesn't excuse the fact that you're a moron if you give a toddler a cup of water filled to the brim and the cup is made of glass. Also, give me a crayon and a piece of paper for the love of god.",

I went next door to get a snack, the bartender completely ignored me for 10 minutes. When he did come over he was snooty and a real bastard. I ordered olives to keep myself from passing out, that took another 15 minutes. He brought it, I gave him a 5 and he never returned with my change! He didn't deserve my money!! But once we finally entered the pizzeria it was boring and overhyped. The wait staff was just as uninterested as the bartender and never brought refills or a glass of water!! Seriously, eff this place",

From the downcast look \"nooo, we don't have pepperoni\" to the quick \"hey, you got to order something beyond drinks if you hang out at the bar\".  ..   It is good pizza.  Nice solid crust, crispy, and fantastic and unique ingredients.  Yet the place isn't Tru or Gary Danko or Aliena.  So for good pizza, yes. . .but that is it.  It still isn't as good as Frank Peppe (CT) and that is served with over a 100years of experience.  Our two pizza's were great  A olive and salumi pizza that was pure goodness.  The next was some sort of white pizza \"are you sure you want a white pizza x10\" was equally impressive.  The beer selection was anemic (with one local draft and a few bottles).  The wine selection fared even better.  If you don't want a pizza , don't eat here.  Certainly not a bad place.  . . should be easy to cut the attitude.",

Charred but not burnt, and never feels like too much dough.   Sauce and toppings have the salty bite you hope for, complements the crust very well.   Service was good - personable enough and relatively prompt. I went during non-peak hours though.   I didn't have any salads, apps, desserts, or drinks since I was in a bit of a rush.   It's not cheap (especially for a lunch), but it is good - I'm more likely to do it as a dinner next time.   Note:  parking is Valet only (unless someone has a yelp tip).",

It was definitely nice to go with a larger group so we could swap slices of the different types of pie!  Three pizzas come with sauce and three are sauce-less, aka white pizzas.  The white pizzas can also be ordered with red sauce, but c'mon...do you really think you know this pizza better than the legendary Mr Bianco??  And don't you DARE ask for red sauce on the side because that just ain't happening!  Well...I tried the margherita...gotta stick with the classic.  It was definitely one of the best margs I've had before, but not the best.  Blasphemy for me to admit this in writing, I'm sure...but the crust was absolute perfection on this and the others I tried.  One gal did the unthinkable and ordered the Biancoverde with red sauce, so was able to try both the traditional white Biancoverde and her modified version. Both were fantastic (and preferable to my margherita!) but Chris had it right without the red sauce.  No shock there!  Parking situation is pretty tight but they have super quick and easy (and free!) valet at the ready.  All in all, I most certainly would NOT wait in line for hours, but for a quick meetup WITH RESERVATIONS it's a great spot.",

    "text": "First trip here in awhile.  A couple of things to update since my last visit.  For starters, they now have longer hours so you can take in this place for lunch, dinner, or a mid-afternoon meal.  We came here for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and didn't have to wait long for a spot inside.  Second, they now have dessert offerings.  Today I had their flourless chocolate cake and it was unquestionably the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever had.  Smooth, rich, velvety texture that is easily sharable.  The one thing that hasn't changed much are the pizzas.  The pizzas choices are limited, but good and are made in the same brick oven that has garnered worldwide acclaim for years.  Today my family and I split a margherita, a wise guy (a white pizza with sausage, mozzarella & onion), and a biancoverde (a white pizza with three different cheeses and arugula).  All had great clean texture and a crispy crust.  Bianco is a Phoenix institution and now has locations in central Phoenix and soon will be opening a location in Tucson.  With good reason.  It's good pizza.  But despite the hype and the accolades, I still can't declare this the best pizza I've had in AZ.  That title still belongs to Pomo just down the road in Downtown Phoenix.  In my own humble opinion, Cibo and Bianco are pretty evenly matched, but Pomo is just a step above.  That said, Bianco has a great product and (as long as you're okay waiting in line for awhile) is worth trying at least once.  From the ambience of its historic downtown location, to the friendly servers and pizzailolos, Bianco definitely offers a unique experience.  Some of you might even find you like Bianco more than the other local titans I mentioned.  Just be sure to pack your patience when you ask for a table.",

Of course try to go on off peak hours and you'll definitely enjoy your experience more and feel neither rushed or crowded.  Limited menu and some ingredients aren't always available, but to me that's a big plus because it's a testament to sourcing only the best available ingredients.   Also make sure to tell them EXACTLY how you like your pizza cooked, light, medium or well.  Either way you'll always a light chewy & flavorful crust,  really excellent to wash down with a cold draft or glass of wine .

    "text": "This place was recommended to me more than pretty much anything else on a trip I made out to Phoenix.  Additionally, I was told that along with their supposedly legendary pizza, were the legendary wait times.  With that in consideration, I strategically planned my visit to be on an in-between time on a Saturday afternoon well after lunch, but fairly before dinner time.  Being downtown, if there's any free parking, I didn't find it, and I parked in a pay garage easily within walking distance.  Pizzeria Bianco would validate my ticket, and in the end, I still paid just a dollar to park for this place.  Regardless, it's located in one of the nicer parts of Downtown Phoenix near all the sports complexes, and not within any eyesight of any of the slummy looking areas.  Regardless of my odd time I chose to show up, there was still a wait, but it wasn't to the extent of three hours as some other users may attest to.  30-40 minutes wasn't bad, mostly because of neighboring Bar Bianco we were suggested to wait at, which was definitely worth a trip in its own right, due to the smoking hot woman working the bar, the Four Peaks beers on tap, and the comfort of a relaxing outdoor country-style patio where I could people watch and enjoy some suds on a not-hot November afternoon.  When I got seated, the interior is very sparse, but an intimate, cozy feeling, and not at all pretentious as a place that might have three hour waits might make a customer feel.  The centerpiece of the establishment is the giant stone oven where pizza is wood baked freshly to order.  I ended up ordering a Wiseguy, but my friend ordered a Rosa.  Trying both pizzas, I'd have to say I preferred the Rosa, but my Wiseguy wasn't bad at all.  If you're thinking of commercialized New York style pizzas with tangy sauces and the entire produce section on it, you probably won't like Pizzeria Bianco.  Their's is definitely more along the lines of artisan, Italiano style, where everything is fresh, tastes fresh, and is absolutely delicious.  The centers are soft and chewy, but the crusts don't make you feel like you're eating wood, either.  $16.00 for my Wiseguy doesn't in the least bit feel steep at all, considering it's far less than what I'd pay for a satisfying steak dinner or something else considered \"fine dining.\"  Ultimately, it was worth the wait.  Classy downtown location, cheap validated parking, great bar with its own great attributes to wait at next door, fantastic bang for buck, and wonderful pizza.  As easy of a five-star rating as I'd give.",

We went almost as soon as it opened on a weekday & got the last indoor table. Within minutes there was a line outside.  The interior is charming but small. We thought the service was great & ordered ice teas before figuring out our pizza choices. I was surprised that they only serve sugar...no sweeteners, but that was ok. During our 45 minutes in the place, they refilled water and teas repeatedly. Next came absolutely delicious bread and very very potent olive oil. Yummy!  We ordered one 1/2 margherita/sausage and 1/2 pistachio red onion and parm. The other pizza was a plain margherita. The oven is so hot that they came in no time & were they ever delicious! The pistachio was very odd, but very compelling. The Italian sausage was the best I've ever eaten...so flavorful! We loved every bite. The crust was delicious as was the sauce on the margheritas.  Best pizza in America? I think that is just too subjective. Certainly one of the best. Don't miss a chance to go to Pizzeria Bianco!",

I've heard from many people that there is usually always a long wait (the place is tiny), but my friend and I were delighted when we were seated immediately. Despite the small amount of customers, it took quite a while to get our order. And, unfortunately I was not impressed with our pizzas. The crust was of the crispy variety, yes, but I don't think burnt is the same thing. I had to waste most of my crust (which is my fave part of pizza) due to this. All in all, it was just ok. I would never wait in line for this pizza ever. In my opinion, Grimaldi's is at least ten times better, and similar in style. Our server was slow and not very attentive and our cashier, despite us handing her two credit cards to split our order, charged just my card for the complete total. Then brought us back BOTH our cards... Whaaat? All in all, disappointed.",

    "text": "This place was disgusting.  It has been almost a year since I went there for the first time and I am finally so sick and tired of hearing people praise this establishment that I finally feel the need to speak up.  Let me describe this horrific experience for you...  First we arrived an hour prior to it's opening because we had heard how busy it would be.  My boyfriend and I were about the 9th or so in line when it began to rain.  Not just a light drizzle, but pour down like the clouds ripped open and dumped everything they had on us.  Since the mesh netting that they have hanging over there outside table and chairs serves ZERO purpose we were all forced into the bar next door.  And by bar I mean walk-in closet sized room that only served a small selection of over priced beer and wine that was busting at the seams with 15 people inside.  I literally felt like a sardine in a tin can.  When we finally made our way out of the over packed room we did enjoy watching the rain fall on the patio.    The time had come and the pizzeria opened their doors to a crowd eager to get out of the wet and cold and chow down on some delicious pies.  Boy were we about to be disappointed.  In our quest to keep dry we had met a guy traveling across the country that really wanted to try as many places as he could that he had seen on food network.  In fact he had stayed an extra day in Phoenix just to try Biancas.  We all decided that we should eat together if for no other reason then to save space and allow another group to get a seat in the 9 table restaurant.  We decided on 3 pizzas all together.  The Rosa, the Wiseguy, and the Biancoverde.  Upon ordering we were reminded that we weren't eating any red sauce pizzas but we were pretty confident with our choices so we went on ahead.  The pizzas arrived and while they did appear delicious, their taste was something quite different.  The rosa was completely bland.  It tasted like nothing but grease.  Definately the worst of the 3.  I thought the Biancoverde was alright but definately missing something (tomato sauce).  When I asked if I could have some I was immediately replied to with NO and the server just walked away.  She then told the chef what I asked for and he proceeded to stare at me with this \"stupid american\" look.  HELLO!!!  I went to dinner in america.  If I want a side of tomato sauce to help choke down YOUR monstrosity then you should JUST GIVE IT TO ME!!!  I am paying for this extremely over rated garbage.    We left disappointed, sopping wet, and grateful that a pizza hut was right down the street from us because I would call there before we will EVER return to Pizzeria Bianco.  Oh and did I mention that my boyfriend also had the WORST case of food poisoning for 36 hours after we ate there.  What a freaking waste of time, money, and what could have been a good meal somewhere else.",

    "text": "This is the toughest review for me yet. Why you ask? Because I really don't think I get it..... I feel the same way about this as I feel when I tell people I hate the Beatles and they look at me like I just ran over their dog.....   I am the type of guy who loves \"an experience\" and from that standpoint, I can handle a very simple meal turning into a 4 or 5 hour process. That said, if I am set to do this, I expect to be completely dazzled with the outcome. When I got there at about 3:45 pm I was about number 35 in line. By 4:30, there were like 100 people in line. The anticipation was building and a strapped myself in for the wait next door. Unfortunately, this was the best part of the evening.  This is my dilemma, it's not that I hated it or thought it was bad in any way, However, the food was ok, definitely a place I would order pizza from and pick it up and take it home. I guess I just fail to see the \"genius\" of this pizza. We started with the spiedini and also ordered a Sonny Boy, Good Fella and the Arugula pizza. Again, it was all good, dough, cheese, meats and veggies. All good ingredients, but seriously, I don't get the big deal. This is not your typical pizza joint pizza which is a good thing, but in my opinion as someone who is a complete pizza nut who eats way too much of it all around the country, I've had better in my opinion.... Oh, I must complement the wait staff, particularly Dave the waiter. Great waiter and friendly as can be.  Maybe my expectations were set too high. I expected to love it so much that I wanted to eat until I exploded... I didn't. A couple years ago I was in NY on business and I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and ate at Patsy Grimaldis under the bridge. Now that experience left me thinking \"HOLY CRAP THAT WAS AWESOME\"... To each his own I guess",

I've eaten pizza all over the country, the top in New Haven, New York and Chicago and even in Italy and Bianco is still the best.  The pizza is unique in the chewy and crispiness plus the hand picked farm fresh ingredients and flavors that will throw your mouth and tongue into doing the tango with each bite.  I always laugh when people tell me they can't imagine waiting 2 or 3 hours to get a pizza.  I've been here probably a hundred times over the last 10 years and it's worth the wait every time.  Why?  It's a great place to wind down and enjoy the fantastic staff, the colloquialish environment and sip wine or beers with friends.  Our modern day everything now, instant delivery, always on society leaves much to be desired in real connection and honest experiences that life is truly all about.  Diving into the Pizzeria Bianco experience with the intention of establishing a delicious connection with Chris Bianco's brain child and allowing for a savory experience- an evening of un-rushed fulfillment is one of the best decisions one can make on any particular day in the valley of the sun, downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "so after having lived in the phoenix area for 2 years, i decided it was high time to finally see some of the restaurants everyone raves about.   This was the first restaurant i was told to try and boy was it amazing.   The wait was crappy but my friend and i just brought something to occupy our time.   Since we are medical students we had plenty of notes to keep us busy. nonetheless, we decided to see what the wine bar was like next door and a couple of glasses of wine later we are all giggles and boy talk.  3 hours later (which is a bit too much in my final opinion) we were seated at the bar and promptly ordered.   We shared an appetizer, spiedini (Italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto with arugula greens) and it was fantastic!! the cheese was perfectly melted and cut by the salty prosciutto and peppery arugula.  As for the pizzas, we each ordered a pizza knowing that we would have leftovers to take home.  I choose the Wise Guy mainly for the fennel sausage and it was worth it!  The pizza crust was amazing, super fresh cheese and the onions were caramelized perfectly.  My friend decided on the Rosa, which she really enjoyed, although we both agreed it was incredibly greasy.   All in all, a fun night away from studying, but is it worth 3 hours of smelling pizza and being starved while you wait? ....That's your call, but i will say it's the best pizza I've ever had in the US and almost as good as the pizza i had in Spain.",

There may have been a couple places in Italy that I liked better, but I don't get there very often.  The pizza at Bianco is so good that I was ready to build a wood-fired oven in my backyard to try to replicate the pizza goodness.  But even with the oven, I'm not sure I could recreate what Chris Bianco is doing in downtown Phoenix.  As if the food weren't good enough, the actual restaurant and neighboring bar just have a great feel to them.  Don't worry about the wait and make a whole evening out of the experience.  As far as I am concerned, Pizzeria Bianco is the single best thing in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Nightmare on My Birthday....  I've never had a Yelp account, but Pizzeria Bianco was so bad tonight I had to write one.  I don't know if the pizza is any good, after 3 hours of rude service and the bartender next door mumbling under her breath at us we confronted the manager, were called trash by her, and told to \"Go back to Scottsdale\"....  I don't even live in Scottsdale!!!  It all began when my girlfriend made reservations for a party of 4 last month for my birthday.  She showed up early at 5:45 with a birthday cake for me from AJ's and asked if they could keep the cake cool until we were seated.  The hostess flat out told her no, the bartender next door was nicer and obliged after a bit of a coaxing.  Then, after ordering a bottle of red wine my girlfriend asked for a red wine glass (larger) to drink out of instead of the chardonnay glass she was handed.  The female bartender told her sorry, they were all out, even though we had ordered a bottle of wine.  Not 3 minutes later a man walked up who must have been a regular because of his and the bartender's familiarity and lo and behold, she found 4 red wine glasses when he ordered a bottle and promised to push more through the dishwasher!!!! Now that's service, just not for us.....  We then ordered multiple appetizers and waited.  And waited....    After we tired of eating the bread, cheese, olives, and other apps we had the bright idea that we could perhaps eat the birthday cake first and that would hold us over until our actual dinner, which was still an hour away according to the rude hostess.  When we asked the bartender if we could have some plates for the cake she curtly replied no, that they had no plates and silverware on the bar side and we couldn't eat there anyway because they would take away the restaurant's food license if they allowed food not prepared on premisis to be served at Pizzeria Bianco.  Funny, but Banderas had no qualms serving us my birthday cake later when we left fed up with the bad service and wait.  I suppose restaurants are held to lower standards than pizzerias.  When my sister's friend said we'd eat it outside on the park benches and started merely cutting the cake into slices at the almost empty bar using a dull cheese knife (empty except for us and two other people) the bartender rudely told her that she couldn't cut the cake at the bar because this was also against the law and Bianco policy.  Really?  A waitress reiterated this and when my sister's friend asked to see this policy on cake the waitress replied \"We can't write every policy down!!!\"  Again, seriously???  We went next door and sat on one of the 3 (three!!!) empty tables outside the actual restaurant with the cake when a server told us we couldn't be there.  We told her we had been on a wait list since about 5:45 (it was 8:40 at the time) and she showed me our name and the time 9:20 next to our names.  I then complained that my poor girlfriend had been there for 4 hours and the manager became very confrontational, saying no one had been waiting that long and getting very huffy about it!  (admittedly, I was wrong, we'd only been there a mere 3 hours!!!) I then asked her what the long wait was about and she motioned at my friends sister, who had said something sarcastic to the bartender next door when my girlfriend was filling out the tip on our tab, admittedly.  My sister's friend had told my girlfriend not to leave a tip because of the rude bartender to which the bartender naively said \"Really? But I've been soooooo nice to you!!!\" My sister's friend then said something along the lines of \"Honey, if that's you being nice I don't want to see you when you're angry.\"  Back to the patio area outside Bianco, a server had called the manager who came out very confrontational and angry, asking if there was a problem.  I noted the long wait time and she said that my girlfriend was welcome back any time because she had behaved nicely but that the rest of us were trash and should \"Go Back to Scottsale\".  I have never been angrier or more shocked at the service, attitude, or general lack of tact by a restaurant.  I was a server for 3 years during college, had much worse behavior by customers and still managed to be calm and understanding when they had a complaint.  The staff at Biancos's?  No chance.  They acted as if we were lucky to have the privilege to wait three plus hours for the chance to eat their sacred pizza and we should shut up and accept however they wished to treat us.   Maybe the pizza is phenomenal, I don't know.  All I know is that we left and went to Banderas where the waitress told us she'd had different customers with similar complaints about the service at Pizzeria Bianco who left and came to Banderas.  She also told us the long wait times were engineered by Bianco to ensure we spend time next door buying wine and appetizers, which are higher profit items than the pizza.  I don't know if that's True, but it might explain why we weren't seated at 8:40.",

    "text": "I dined at Pizzeria Bianco with 10 other people in my dining-out group, all of whom are experienced with quality restaurants both in the U.S. and abroad.  No one thought this came close to being a quality dining experience.  A 7pm reservation for 11 people meant that we were shuttled over to an adjoining building to wait, where one glass of house wine was $13, which immediately set the wrong tone, along with the wait.  The reason given for the wait was to be sure the group had all arrived, despite the fact that everyone had arrived prior to 7pm; the real reason is to get more money out of everyone waiting,  through excessive wine prices.  Bad customer service.   At 7:15 someone came to the waiting room and said our table was ready; everyone marched over to the restaurant to find out that our 7pm reservation was still not ready.  Bad customer service.  Back at the waiting room we asked for menus so we could make our food selections while waiting.  We were told that they had only one menu for everyone in the waiting room (others were waiting besides our group also).  Bad customer service.  Finally at 7:30 I went back to the restaurant  to check on our table and was told at the door that the table was ready, a fact we had to find out on our own.  Bad customer service.  We were seated at several small tables pushed together in the corner, not in a separate room as I had been led to believe over the phone.  Bad customer service.  Extremely cramped; noise level so high that conversation was difficult.  Drinks were brought, and I had to insist we were ready to order, not wait. The pizzas came out fairly fast.  Mediocre.  Thin crusts that were more like dried out crackers-a smear of tomato sauce with no distinctive flavor-some cheese.  The much-praised quality was simply not there, and this assessment was shared by all the other members of our party.  Some mentioned how much better Humble Pie is for pizza; others mentioned Grimaldi's.  I asked for separate checks, as I had requested over the phone when making the reservation.  Absolutely not.  Bad customer service.  We left, with no one planning to ever return or recommend  the restaurant.  Due to non-distinctive pizza, lack of customer service, high noise level, and cramped seating, this restaurant is vastly over-rated, and it is another mystery of marketing that this establishment has created the unwarranted hype that it has.",

They did an alright job on the sauce. It isn't pasty or anything. My friend didn't put cheese on the thing so I really can't give you a good review because it was missing one of the key ingredients. The bread and sauce were good though. Who knows what else the taste combination could turn out to be?

I got there 40 minutes before they opened and still missed the first seating and then ended up waiting over 90 minutes after they opened which by what some people have written was a short wait. I'll agree that it's in a cool old building and the little house where the bar is next door is cute too but I can't justify the wait to the quality of the pizza being served. If there wasn't such a long wait I would have given them the 4th star but with that wait, I can't be a fan. There's not much of a selection in there pizzas but they do have a short list of other toppings you can get. I had a margherita and had them throw on some Sicilian Anchovies and sliced tomatoes. The anchovies were great but the tomatoes were sliced way too thick and they skimped on the Basil. I have a bit of experience working in a pizzeria and I know that you sometimes have to pop the bubbles, I guess they don't believe in popping the bubbles on their pizza because I had a big one and with a super hot oven it just burned an looked nasty. No, I won't go back but I don't live in Phoenix but I travel here often. Next time I will try a different pizza place where I don't blow an entire evening waiting.",

On a cool weekend night, you'll notice the long wait for a table; however, go to their building next door for a glass of wine while you wait. If you like your dinner companion, why would you mind? It's a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere, like a barbeque from your friend's back yard. The food is excellent and served for sharing across the table. I recommend it.",

We arrived at 9 PM to which the hostess gave us an approximate wait time of 90 minutes.  We sat on the benches and grabbed some wine from the bar next door.  Sure enough, we weren't seated until about 10:30 PM.  Be sure to stay around the restaurant at 10 PM as they perform a roll call.    We ordered a Wiseguy and Margurita for our entrees.  Our waitress gave the tables by us bread and olive oil but neglected us until we asked another waitress.  The bread was actually quite delicious.  As for the pizza, it was good, but not outstanding as we hoped.  We have had similar pizza in Dallas and San Francisco.  Was this the best, no it was not.   Waiting for a few hours, one expects the pizza to live up to the hype and unfortunately the pizza is overrated.    We left saying that we tried Pizza Bianco but we won't be back here for our next Spring Training trip.  It's just not worth the wait and there are other pizza places just as good in the Phoenix area.",

I think Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria is almost as good but less pricey (still not cheap) and no wait. If Bianco was closer to me in Chandler I'd go more often but Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a mile away and 90% as good.",

Our food ticket got lost and it took 45 minutes and us trying to flag someone down to even get attention. When we brought up that we didn't have food, they acted totally clueless. Then offered us a complimentary salad to make up or it. We didn't want the salad because we weren't that hungry, plus after 45 minutes they finally put some bread on our table. When the pizza came, our server and everyone else ignored us. No manager even came to apologize. So when we got the bill we expected at least 20% off especially since we didn't want the salad. No discount, no server, the hostess brought it to us and therefore, very little tip.",

I was glad to see they have not changed their menu and tthe quality of food hasn't changed, which is a good thing because they keep everything fresh and delish.    If your going just for the pizza pies, this might not be the place for you due to the wait time. My advise for the people that complain about the wait time ~ make friends!  Take someone more interesting with you next time you go to Pizzeria Bianco and your wait time will fly by!!   If your planning to enjoy an evening hanging with some friends, this is a wonderful place to go and enjoy some pizza, wine and conversation. Our wait was just over an hour, which is very good considering most wait times are 2 hours + but that didn't matter since we were at the bar enjoying some good wine and catching up on life's frills and thrills.  Time flew by during our wait and we were eating in no time.    We had their tomato, basil and homemade mozzarella salad for starters.  It was very good, fresh and the perfect balance of dressing. For dinner we had the Wise Guy and Sonny Boy pizza pies which were good but not the best I've tasted.  Their pizza crust is exceptional and the best feature of their pies in my opinion.  This is a must try if you haven't been and remember to take some good friends and enjoy the wine before you dine!!  We like Patsy Girmaldi's pizza pies as good or better but we enjoy the experience we have with our friends when we go to Pizzeria Bianco.",

A year later, I found out they are serving lunch and we gave it another try - this time on Sat. for my husband's birthday - he loves pizza! We were seated right away - our choice bar or table.  We opted for a table and were waited on promptly. We both got Bubble Up to drink (Basically 7-up in retro bottles) and the Sonny Boy.    The pizza was good, wood fired (Honestly, not a big fan of this style), fresh ingredients.  One pizza is enough for two.  Once they spotted we were getting to the end of the pizza - we were asked if we wanted a coffee or anything else - no we didn't and was promptly given the check.    We both felt that the pizza was good, not worth waiting any time longer than 10 minutes for (too many other places to choose from) and the wait staff moved you along very quickly, don't even think about lingering for after dinner conversation unless you are ordering more food/drink.  Now I can say, I've been there done that.",

Please note that many legendary great chefs throughout the U.S were featured. The longest line was for Pizzeria Bianco. O.K., now I get it! That pizza was beyond delicious. I love that the chef was making that pizza dough on-site and brought along a portable wood-burning oven. OMG, I was thrilled to donate money to facilitate pediatric cancer research. However, when Pizzeria Blanco shows up with his great tasting samples and Suzanne Goin gives away her famous short ribs as sliders and Jonathan Waxman flies in from NYC to serve up a great skirt steak, you know you are in a for a good day. Consensus: Pizzeria Bianco \"stuck the landing.\" Thanks for mentoring Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton.  Fortunately, I have friends in Phoenix.

Last night (Friday), my friend (a former Phx resident) was back in town for a quick visit and wanted for us to finally try out Pizzeria Bianco. We put our name down around 8:30pm and were surprised to hear the wait was only about 1hr 15mins -1hr 30. We went next door to the bar (which was super cute, btw!) and chatted over a bottle of wine. Right when we started to get really hungry, we were notified that our table was ready. Yay.. time to find out what all the hype is about!   Since there were 6 of us, we decided we'd order 1 of each pizza so we could try it all. However, once the waiter came to take our orders, we all changed up our orders. After about 10-15mins or so, out came our pizzas. Well, 5ish of the 6. I say, \"5ish,\" because the 6th one was really really burnt (whereas ours were just \"really burnt\") and the waiter said another one would be made and ready in 2 mins.   We all hungrily waited for the last pizza to come out and when it finally did, we dug in. I dont know if it's bc we waited a few mins or what, but all of our pizzas were soggy. That combined w/ the burntness made for a very bleh pizza. While it wasn't horrible, I dont see how it could get all the hype and 5 stars that it does.   Since the ingredients were really fresh, the wait wasn't as bad as anticipated, PB (and the bar) have a cute cozy atmosphere and the service was good, I'd be willing to give it another try.. but definitely not if the wait is any more than 1.5hrs.",

But when my mom flew in and insisted on Bianco I thought, what the heck so we made a day of it, we got there and put our names on the list, went next door and got a bottle of wine, the wait was long but I had great company and awesome wine....when we got called and walked in and the smell of the resturant was so overwhelming, I was almost scared that the food was gonna disappoint for sure because nothing could top those delicious aroma's in the air....then the pizza's arrived!!!! HOLY COW!!!! I got the ROSA and it WAS worth the wait..in all honesty its unlike anything I have ever tasted!  Will I go back...Absolutely!  My advice is, do not go if you are in a hurry, you have to make a day of it, enjoy the wait by going with awesome people, have some wine and be ready for the best pizza you have ever tasted!  For those people who freak out about spending money on wine and what not, you're probably right..you SHOULD goto Costco, this place isn't for you..Bianco, and places like it are for people with a True appreciation for culinary experiences and not impatient people who wouldn't know the difference if you served them a Bordeaux Chateau Lafite or some Franzia.",

    "text": "We finally bit the bullet and decided to wait for dinner at Pizzeria Bianco. I was disappointed. No, I was angry at how bad an experience it was.  I won't be so naive as to complain about the wait, we went knowing it would be a long wait, and arriving at 4:45, we were told it would be 3.5 to 4 hours. No big surprise there. Luckily we were actually sat at 7:45, so that was nice.   The market salad was great, a super light vinaigrette, super fresh escarole greens and nicely shaved parmigiano reggiano. The Antipasto was amazing as well, with roasted vegetables and olives and sopressata. So far I was very pleased with my meal.  Then came the pizza. We ordered the Wiseguy, and added mushrooms and garlic.  Now I've had thin crust pizza cooked in a wood fired oven before, but I have NEVER had it be not only undercooked in the center but completely sopping wet. We're talking grab the crust and pull a slice to your place and only get 2 inches of actual pizza, with the rest of the mush still in the center of the plate. Ok, so its a little undercooked, big deal right?  Wrong. So wrong. The sausage must have been sitting next to the anchovies (which I like) because the sausage slices on half of the pizza tasted like  bait chum smells. If you've ever been to a harbor, and smelled that rotting fish carcass smell, imagine how that would taste and you'll understand.   My wife apparently lucked out and didn't get any pieces with that taste because she said it was fine. I was not so lucky. When she had a leftover slice the next day though she got a taste of that and literally lost her lunch.  I'm a VERY forgiving type with restaurants, but I am not ok with waiting 3 hours to feast on undercooked rotted fish tasting pizza. I've never been angry about a dining experience before now, but that's the only way I can describe this debacle.  I may give it another chance, but only after I've simmered for a while.",

Also, whenever I have family or friends in town my husband and I take them here.  When I went there tonight, I was really disappointed though.  The food was amazing- the service of one particular waiter was not.  He was pretty rude to us.  We were only there eating for an hour, this was after waiting over an hour for a table (which we always wait, and never have an issue with, it's well worth the wait and we just go next door and drink wine), and we decided to get a fourth pizza.  Keep in mind there were four of us, we had two bottles of wine and several pizzas, always eating and drinking, never lagging just sitting there talking keeping the table from other costumers.  We told the waiter we wanted to get another pizza while we were only half way done with our last, and he was really rude and said fine- but last call.  Seriously?!?  There were people there that had been sitting there longer than us, not eating or drinking, just wasting time- get snooty with them!  Then we decided that we were just going to go, my husband asked the waiter to cancel our pizza, and he sighed and said it was too late and we have to have it now.  Then when it was done he kinda threw it at us.  We ate then decided to only tip 10%- super rare for us, and we wrote a note telling him why.  On our way out, the waiter said something to my uncle and my uncle just replied that we loved the food but we didn't appreciate being rushed out even though there were others around us that weren't even eating.  The waiter kinda left for a moment and by the time I caught up to my husband who was lagging behind my uncle- the waiter said that we need to be considerate of other customers and be more thoughtful.  My husband replied, yes I see your point, and if we weren't buying 2 bottles of wine, salad, and four pizzas in just an hour I would agree that we were just taking up space, but odds are we spent more in our one hours just us four than if they had two normal tables come through.  The guy just said, nah, its about consideration and walked away.  Seriously guy?!?!  I wanted to go back and take away all his tip and just give it straight to the bus staff, hostess and cooks- pretty much everyone but this guy.  I called there after we left and spoke with the hostess and she was amazing!!!  Seriously, she saved the night.  All she did was apologize for this guys behavior and offer to pay for some food.  We would not take her up on paying for our food because that was not the point, but she saved it for sure.  Mr. Bianco: please know that your hostess with the broken leg is amazing- and if is wasn't for here we would never come back no matter how much we love the food.  Furthermore, the way she took responsibility for the situation- even though it wasn't her fault was amazing.  She's a great employee- I highly recommend some kind of commendation for her.  As for the waiter- if we ever visit, and see that guy we will make sure we don't sit in his section otherwise we will leave.",

Ordered Antipasto which was a mysterious combination of 1 slice cheese, 1 slice fried eggplant, a bit of sausage and some mystery food (I think beans). This was on the menu for $15. I never had anything like this before, and hope I never will again.  It was gross. The pizza tasted fabulous.  My only objection was the price of this tiny pie,  12\" pizza pie for $20.  Only enough to feed one hungry person.  Way overpriced!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am from the East Coast, have lived in Boston, New York and Connecticut and good pizza has always been at my fingertips. But not like this!   I read some reviews before I went and decided that I would get there 3 hours early! They open at 5pm but believe it or not by 2:30, there had to be 40 people waiting outside! Bar Bianco next door opens an hour before The Pizzeria and waitresses serve you cold drinks and appetizers while you wait in line. (Not such a bad idea Mr. Bianco)  We were a table of 6 and were able to be seated on the first turn. I ordered a 'Wise Guy', wood roasted onion, smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. After my first bite I summoned the waiter and ordered a second pizza. \"To go?\" He asks. \"No for right now!\" That first bite was like revelation. The crust was crispy but also light and airy almost like freshly made indian naan straight from a tandoor oven. The second pie 'Sonny Boy' was a blend of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami and olives.   I had made friends with a guy in line. He was from Italy and had just moved to the States. He said that this is the pizza that tastes the closest to what he grew up eating in Italy.    My personal favorites rank Pizzeria Bianco (PHX), Frank Pepe (CT), Lombardis (NY) and Upper Crust (Boston)  This pizza is definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "I came here on a recommendation of a friend from NYC that this was quite possibly one of the best pizza places in the United States. Of course, I'm pretty biased towards loving my New York style thin-crust pizzas but I decided to give it a try.   My friend Rachael and I arrived at around 5:30 pm hoping to catch the Suns game (about 5 blocks away!) at 8 pm. My friend from New York had warned me about the wait time, but when we arrived, we saw no line and found that it wasn't terribly crowded inside. However, once we got in and put our name down, we found out the wait was 2.5 hours! The hostess kindly suggested we go to the bar next door while Rachael and I debated back and forth whether or not to wait that long for pizza.   Anyways, we ended up going to Bar Bianco right next door (brilliant idea to have this place open next door) and waited for our turn. We were called about 7:45 pm (2 hour and 15 minute wait). We ordered the Margherita pizza - $11 (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) and Biancoverde -$14 (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula - aka lots of cheese). The Margherita was perfect with the right amount of tomato sauce/basil taste and the Biancoverde was good up to the second slice where it might have just been a tad bit more cheese than I can take in all in one night.   Thumbs Up: price (relatively cheap - we spent about $30 for both of us with two pizzas including tip!), quality, staff was very friendly, and lastly - probably the best pizza i have ever had in my life.  Thumbs Down: the wait (was horrible - but drinking does help), uber small space (why can't they just add an extension and make the wait shorter for everyone?)",

    "text": "I'm in Phoenix and staying with a friend for a conference (TPE/NASPA). Never having been to Phoenix before I asked my friend for a few suggestions around the convention center area to have lunch/dinners with old friends and colleagues. He suggested this place and informed me it is ranked #1 in the nation. Being an aspiring foodie and someone who is very judgmental of pizza, these are big shoes to fill. Myself and a good friend went on a Friday around 12:15, I was a little nervous about getting in and out in the needed time, knowing that it was a small place and could have hours of wait time for dinner. Not a problem. We were seated immediately and there were tables to spare. We both ordered coke lights (apparently the Italian version of diet coke) and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty. We asked our server if we could only order one pizza which one he would suggest. He told us the Biancoverde with added prosciutto was the one to get, so we went for it. NO REGRETS. This pizza was tasty. Thin crust and oh so flavorful, the ricotta and cheese were amazing, and the prosciutto was yummy, not overly salty like some can be. It can seem a little pricey, our one pizza was $24 but it fed both of us comfortably. I definitely recommend and passed along the info to a couple friends at the conference as well. I may even end up venturing back before my time comes to an end in Phoenix...only time will tell...",

It is not unusual for  patrons to wait 3-4 hours for a table.   I usually go to a restaurant when I am hungry.  The concept of waiting  hours to eat while you are hungry escapes me.  Having said that, it is certainly not the fault of Bianco's for being so popular.  It's their choice not to take reservations. It's my choice not to patronize a place that does not take reservations.  My dilemna is Bianco's is unique and I like their food.  Basically, we are talking about a pizza joint.  But you just need to observe Bianco himself at the brick oven, making his fabulous pizzas, and you will get it.  You are watching something special, an artist at work. I know it sounds corny, but until you observe this culinary artist at work, hold your judgment.",

We were told the wait would be 2 hours, so we decided to go to Nobua instead.  We went back on Thursday night around 9PM and were able to get in with just a 20 minute wait.   I LOVE neapolitan style pizza.  Here in Dallas, I go to Cavalli's on a regular basis and love it.  I knew I would love Bianco, the big question is would I think it is the \"best pizza in America\"?  It might be.  Honestly, any certified Neapolitan pizza place is going to be nearly as good as Bianco.  It's not rocket science, it's just the right oven and the right ingredients and the right touch.  However, I will say Bianco might do it a touch better than the rest.   The crust is amazing.  It's perfectly done, with just enough burnt on the edges for my taste.  I ate every piece of edge there was, which is unusual for me.  (I tend to leave some crust edge.)  The toppings are perfect, the Sopprasata was amazing, the fennel sausage was great, the sauce was perfect.   It's basically the perfect pizza.  Yet, I was kind of disappointed.  It made me realize that I've tasted the best pizza out there and it is only slightly better than some local places.  I guess I should look at it in a good way, that I can drive 10 minutes and get an amazing pizza at Cavalli any day of the week, a pizza that rivals the best in America.",

Anyway, we arrived at 5:45 PM and the restaurant was packed. It was a 2 hour wait and since we never ever get the chance to eat out anymore, we stuck it out. Ms. C and I sat in the lawn chairs underneath a romantic string of Christmas lights and shared a bottle of Pinot Noir ($36) which was soft, round, and lovely. K had a beer.   90 minutes later we were starving and shared a cheese panini appetizer.  At exactly 7:50 PM we were seated at our table. After a bottle of wine, Ms. C and I were feeling rather swell. We looked at the wine list and debated about which glass of wine to get. Then we laughed and said \"screw it\" let's just have another bottle!  This time it was the Cabernet Sauvignon. I had an early early morning flight the next day, and believe me I wasn't looking so good in PHX Terminal 4 at 8 AM.   I think it's  a trick that Bianco has--get you liquored up and relaxed so that a meal that really should cost only $50 for 3 people, ended up being $120. Haha...he really got us!  We got 2 salads: the Mozzarella and the Farmers Market salad. Both were satisfying. The FM salad was interesting with arugula and pomegranates.   We shared 3 pizzas: the Rosa, Wiseguy, and Sonny Boy. All 3 were delicious. I'd definitely come back again but only WITH reservations.",

Even arriving well before opening time, there was already a line forming in front of the door just like the reviews said. The hot June sun was not making this any easier, but we were only a handful of people from the front of the line.   I went with the Wiseguy - wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage and was not disappointed. Every ingredient worked together to form a masterpiece. The smokey cheese complimented the caramelized onions, and savory sausage quite nicely. From making his own cheese, to picking fresh ingredients himself at the market, you can tell that the man behind this establishment has a passion for what he creates. Well worth the hour and change in line.  On our way out Chris Bianco himself, even though he was busy with orders in the kitchen, took the time to ask how our experience was. Awesome! I will definitely be back back again.",

It is better than any pizza I have found in Rome, Florence, Venice, Chicago, LA, Boston, NYC, etc.",

    "text": "FOOD: The pizza itself was quite tasty. It kind of melts in your mouth. This probably isn't a common thing, but my friend found a bug in her pizza that was probably thrown on with the vegetable toppings. By this time, we've all grown a little frustrated with this place. If you get a bug-free pizza, it's great.   PRICE: A little expensive for pizza standards, but nothing that will have you digging deep into your wallet. Beware, the drinks do NOT come with free refills, including soft drinks. I spent around $15.   SERVICE: The absurd wait for a table is what's keeping me from going to Pizzeria Bianco more often. Be prepared to wait a couple hours for a table, unless you make a reservation weeks in advance. The hours of operations of this place are laughable, only a couple hours each night, and are closed for at least one day out of the week. I wasn't too impressed with the service. The waiter failed to mention that soft drinks do not come with free refills.   SKINNY: Great food, but there were too many drawbacks to this place to keep me coming back again and again. The long wait, bug in a pizza, lack of free refills, and higher than average prices are too much to be ecstatic about Pizzeria Bianco. Worth to try once, though.",

    "text": "If you have 5 hours to kill for dinner, Pizzeria Bianco may be your best bet. I've been going here for years, since Chris' place was in Town & Country mall, next to my other old favorite Coyote Springs Brewing Co. You could go in for lunch and not have to wait one bit. I don't even remember if he was open for dinner, but damn we used to go 2-3 time a week for lunch.   So flash forward to when Jerry Colangelo coaxed him into moving downtown, as part of Jerry's dreams of a DisneyLand downtown. The waits got longer and longer, and as of about two years ago were still tolerable. The last time I went was just before the Oprah/Martha Stewart mess, and at 9:45 only waited 40 minutes for a table. People wait longer at Oregano's. This is no longer possible though as half the time they cut off the names at 8-9pm if they realize they are going to be there to 1am to accommodate everyone. I'd say average weekday wait is 2 hours, weekends 3+. I can ONLY, and I mean ONLY justify this because I live across the street.  The food is amazing, and literally the perfect pizza. The crust is perfect, the ingredients all extremely high quality and homemade much of the time. Gotta love the Shriner's Sausage as well. I like Cibo's Antipasta better, but everything else about Bianco nudges them out. One thing you can count on too is no matter how busy Chris is, he will absolutely aknowledge and smile at you. It's that kind of thing, letting someone know you appreciate their business even though you don't need it, that really counts.   Even with the awesome food, and fun ambiance, is it worth the wait? I'm not sure any pizza is worth waiting 3 hours for, and like I said, if I wasn't able to walk home, watch a movie, and then come back, I'm not sure I'd go back. You can go to Cibo and have no/little wait... sure it isn't as good, but I have to question if any pizza is that good. Try it once at least, and be your own judge. You owe it to yourself.",

    "text": "Okay, so... I finally hopped on the Pizzeria Bianco bandwagon, after noticing the unyielding avalanche of praise being thrown its way.  (Actually, if I'm being perfectly honest, I only happened by because I went to see the Star Trek Exhibit at the Arizona Science Center - *Snort!*)  I knew in advance about the insufferable wait, and it certainly appeared as described. Worse, even, than I had previously been made aware. For a sense of scale, let me simply say that I brought my Nintendo DS... and beat a game.. and started another one..  ..and still had to wait another hour.  But, Jesus Tiberius CHRIST, was the food worth it! Mind you, I had been previously assured that the pizza was delicious, but I wasn't quite aware that it would be completely unlike anything I've stuffed down my gob prior. Fresh tomatoes, fresh dough, fresh cheese, fresh seasonings, Fresh Prince (psyche!) - that's this place's secret. The tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, not some canned, processed rubbish. I could make a meal of the crust, alone.  I'm not even a food snob about this sort of thing. I happily proclaim that Little Caesars' 5 1/2 dollar pizzas are some of the yummiest pies around. But this pizza is truly Ninja Turtle-worthy. Worth both the wait and the above-average price. I want to buy the guy who made it a drink - non-alcoholic, mind you, because an adult beverage might prompt him to take a break.. and we simply cannot chance that.",

    "text": "To start, I'd like to point out that Pizzeria Bianco did not make the claim of having the best pizza in the country (to my knowledge); it was made by others. Regardless, I thought it was a bold statement. I mean, who could possibly say that about pizza? Pizza is so subjective (i.e. deep dish, thin crust, grilled, electric oven, brick oven, etc.), and you can't possibly satisfy everyone with one type of pizza.  Well, curiosity still managed to get the best of me, so I convinced two of my friends to drive 5 1/2 hours with me to Phoenix to find out for myself. (As an FYI, we did go to a few other restaurants on that day-long trip. Just wanted to make that clear so you don't think I was entirely crazy for driving that far to check out just one joint.)  We got to PB around 6pm and I gave the hostess my name.    \"It'll be a 3 1/2 hour wait,\" she casually informed me.    She smiled, but she didn't blink. She didn't give off even the slightest impression that she felt bad that we'd have to wait so long for pizza (in 110+ degree Arizona heat, mind you). It's nothing short of crazy that we are living in an era where pizza-in-under-thirty-minutes has been replaced by pizza-in-three-hours. I guess if I had to think of anything positive about waiting that long is that you can go next door to their bar, go across the way to The Rose and Crown and shoot pool or just befriend others who are just as crazy as you are for waiting that long for pizza.  Having said all that, here is my review:  The ambience is nice. It's dimly-lit to create a romantic environment for couples, or just a peaceful dining experience if you're with friends.  The country bread, as simple as it looks, is really good, especially when you dip it in the olive oil (add salt and pepper).  Finally, the pizzas were... AMAZING. We had built up our expectations so much that by the time we got the order, we were positive we would be disappointed. But with the first bite, we knew our trip was not made in vain. It was completely worth it. And that's saying a lot since I'm a die-hard deep dish guy. To say these were thin would be an understatement; sometimes you could see through the pizza because it was so thin.    Sonny Boy - The amount of tomato sauce and the fresh ingredients went perfectly together. Though I'm not a fan of salami, the pieces on this pizza created a party in my mouth. So rich. So good.  Wise Guy - No tomato sauce on this (note that half of the pizzas on the menu do not have tomato sauce), but the onions, mozzarella, and sausage were amazing as well, just bursting with flavor. Yes, bursting.     So... was it worth the drive? To be honest, I think even if it didn't meet the hype, the experience would have been worthwhile. I mean, come on, you only live once. Why not do a few out-of-the-ordinary things occasionally? Fortunately for us, Bianco's was outstanding and definitely worth driving out for.    Mr. Bianco, you get 5 stars from me because your pizzas are my favorite in the country.",

Just like everyone tells you, you're going to wait 2.5 to 3 hours for a table for two. Sounds ridiculous, but just be prepared to make an evening out of it (and do not come starving). We sat at the bar next door during our wait which is a fabulously cozy, home. They have small shared plates and a nice selection of beer and wine to choose from while you wait. When it came to the actual pizza - yes, it was good but I think you can find better - or at least comparable elsewhere. Overall, great expereience but not worth the hype.",

    "text": "What can be said about Bianco that hasn't been said before? Pizzeria Bianco has been raved about for many years now, with good reason! Chris Bianco has built his establishment into a Phoenix staple. Every visit I'd say well over half of his clientele is brand new, no small feat since he's spent 14 years in the same location. To say the least, Pizzeria Bianco is a well-reviewed, well-loved and die-hard restaurant.  Put this into perspective: I've patronized Pizzeria Bianco roughly 40-50 times (many of those times have been in post-100 degree heat, non-coincidentally the Bar Bianco next-door opens an hour earlier than the Pizzeria so grab a beer) and each time I've waited 1-2 hours for the privilege. Are there many places in the whole world where you'd do that? Once you taste the sensation within, you'll understand.  The pizzas are wood-fired in a brick oven and until recently, they'd all been fired and created by one man, Chris Bianco, whom forcefully had to take a leave of absence from his dedication to his craft. Why? All the wood smoke and flour dust has taken a toll on him over the years and irritated his asthma to a point where his doctor insisted that he stay out of the kitchen if he wanted to live into his 50s. It may seem silly to an outsider but to see Chris's passion for what he does, you'd instantly empathize.  The creations that come from the oven are simple, yet complex in flavor and texture. They're thin-crust Italian style pizzas that are True to the heart of Tuscany and Roma. In True Italian spirit, less is more on the pizza with only a few ingredients playing on the stage. My favorite at Bianco is to order a Margarita pizza and add mushrooms and perhaps some garlic. What returns is amazing. You wouldn't think that dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, Criminis and garlic could formulate something so flavorful and distinct but there it is.  A favorite before the pizza is unquestionably an Antipasto plate! Familiar ingredients grace the plate almost every time (mushrooms, sopressata, olives and parmesan) with one or two guest players (eggplant parm or roasted red pepper). Given a health dose of olive oil and graced in the oven, the plate comes to you a variety of textures and tastes.  There are a few salads offered as well. The pizza, antipasto and salads comprise the entire menu. It's simple but elegant in a setting at Heritage Square that makes it a True, one-of-a-kind experience and completely unique to Phoenix. Yes, you need some time to kill (I recommend getting there at least an hour before opening) and the ability to tolerate weather and a few line cutters, but you will be rewared with what has been called and I whole-heartedly agree is the \"best pizza in America\".",

As repeatedly hyped by reviewer after reviewer, I was expecting a well above average pizza comparable to those in New York. Instead, I was shocked to be served the worst pizza in my life.  Honestly, my high school cafeteria's had more flavor. The bland crust had ok texture, but when topped by a scant amount of what tasted like canned tomato sauce and packaged mozzarella, I could barely get through it. And how did they find utterly flavorless basil? I'll never know. The fact that an amazing pizzeria (Mama Mia's on Indian School) exists just a couple miles away makes me sick that I wasted my time and money at this place. I visited the Town & Country location FYI. Won't be back. Ever.",

Either way, as with most places, if you know what you're getting yourself into, then just plan for it and have a good time.  The pizza is really freaking good, and what's even better is that it reheats super well.  Just pop it in the oven the next day and bada-boom, bada-bing - lunch!  Oh, one more thing - if you can't decide which pizza you want, you can get a half and half!  Who could ask for more?!",

We arrived 30 minutes before they opened to find a line of at least 60 people.  This is why were advised to go a different night.  When we finally put our name in the hostess informed us it would be 3 to 3 1/2 hrs before we got a table.  Normally this sounds horrible, but the wine bar, Bar Bianco, next door makes that wait bearable.  The hostess and staff at Bar Bianco are absolutely fabulous.  They let you know that you can leave and call back every hour to check on where your name is on the list.  When you sit down at Bar Bianco the waitress will ask your name and keep track of your reservation and let you know when your table is ready.  The most important part of the pizza, the crust, was excellent.  It had the perfect slightly charred crust but chewy when bitten into.  Of course we tried the margherita then went with the wiseguy as we wanted to try a white pizza as well.  Best margherita pizza I've ever had.  I could have done without the wiesguy.  I should have known to stay away from a white pizza but was glad we tried something different.  A couple we met in line suggested we try the Spiedini-Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm.  Oh mama was it good.",

With the opening of their new location wait times are short or non-existent during the week. Although, this convenience comes with a caveat... increased prices. It is now $15 for a Margherita. Really? Maybe if this was truly one of the finest pies in the US you could get away with that. Alas, it is not.   The pizza was just okay. It was a cracker-thin, crunchy crust with no chewiness whatsoever. If I wanted crackers I would have picked up a box a saltines. The Wiseguy was just decent as well. The onions could have been sliced thinner. The sauce was on point. The pizza was not bad by any means I just had very high expectations going in.   Our service was attentive and efficient. Our drinks were filled even after the bill was paid. Needless to say, it is unlikely that I will return. I'd rather go down the street to Cibo and get a delicious $10 Margherita.",

I tried it once at night and after an hour and 15 minutes I gave up. I couldn't help but wonder  1. why don't they serve food outside? 2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger? 3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?  Well, they they started serving lunch. Usually it's too far for me to run to during the work week but I happened to have a random day off and luckily I put this on my list.  I was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. Hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. I had a tasty coke from a bottle (I'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the Margherita after debating whether to go red or white. 5 minutes after I ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. Wish I woulda known!  It took awhile to get my pizza but it was damn tasty. Maybe a 20-30 min wait tasty, but not a 4 hour wait tasty. Still good, still glad I went, still want to go again, definitely not at night, but lunch is my saving grace.",

    "text": "After all the hype surrounding Pizzeria Bianco, what would a visit to Phoenix be without giving it a try.   A Wednesday night we arrived at 4:30 and got on the back of the line. The doors opened promptly at 5pm, when we got to the hostess we were told an hour and 20 minute wait. I hate waiting, I make reservations for everything to avoid waiting, but since we had a delicious late lunch which I'll save that for another review, we didn't mind the wait so much. We headed over to the wine bar and waited with a couple of glasses. After close to 1.5 hours our table was ready.   The place holds about 40 people. After reading all the reviews we had to try the Spiedini which is Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm and on a stick. Salty and creamy, it was very yummy. The bread they serve is excellent. Thick crusty crust and tender chewy on the inside. Not that you need bread before pizza, but after all the waiting how could you not have a piece, especially when it smells so good.   Pizza we had to try the Bianco Verde; Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. I am not a fan of Parmigiano, so it was a bit too much for me, but overall it was a good pizza. We also had the Wiseguy; Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage. This pizza was more my style. It was delicious, the sweet onions paired with the smokey mozzarella and sausage was almost perfect. The crust on both pies is pretty amazing, it has the same chewiness and spring that the bread had.   Would I call it the best pizza ever? No.  Would I consider it really good with an awesome crust? Yes.  Would I go again? Yes, but maybe I can hire someone to do the waiting for me.",

    "text": "I was weary about visiting Pizzeria Bianco because it's location from my house but I thought- if Oprah recommends it- it must be amazing! And it didn't disappoint. It's a smaller space so if you're coming with a large group I'd definitely come in early and maybe put in your name and have a drink at one of the (within' walking distance) bars nearby. Once you're in, it's so worth it! The pizza is so authentic and woodfired, which is a favorite of mine! The atmosphere is another factor that I really enjoyed. The industrial/cosy combo was a nice touch and they had many options on their menu.   A con would be the parking. I had to park at a nearby parking garage and walk over. They did wind up having a lot, but it was small and only valet (that I could see) so you end up paying either way. Something to keep in mind if you're pinching pennies or just want the ease!",

We started at bar bianco next door with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the hard apple cider -really good and we shared the cheese plate and the ricotta crepes. Yum! The Bianco Dinapoli tomato sauce with the crepes was really good, we dipped our bread/crackers in it.  Once our table was ready they called us over to the restaurant. We had a table for 2 inside, it's a bit small inside, making it pretty cosy.  We ordered just the Rosa pizza, the one with pistachios. It was really good. Good medium size ish pizza with great flavor. Good for 2 to share. While I did like the bar, the appetizers, pizza, and the location...I'm just not sure I want to wait 40 mins to 2 hours to get in every time.",

    "text": "Plan ahead.... Thanks to all the factiods on Yelp, my best friend and I had a pretty good idea what to expect at Pizzeria Bianco. We were in a pretty good mood after catching a matinee of Hangover, and some light shopping, so we headed down to Heritage Square to check out this place. We got there at 3:15, and nothing is happening until 4. When we got there, there were already 2 ladies and a baby in line for a 5 p.m. opening. (And remember it's 110 degrees out!!) We chatted with these regulars for a while, and they did confirm if you're not in line, when the doors open, you don't get in. Seriously??? For pizza??? We headed over to the quaint Irish pub across the square to 'hydrate' and play some cards. At 4 we strolled back to Pizzeria Bianco (up to 5 people in line now) and claimed our spot. We brought books, chatted with the other folks and within 20 minutes, there was quite a line. We were saved from total boredom by buying a bottle of wine from Bar Bianco where they graciously kept it cool while we tagged teamed for fresh glasses so we wouldn't lose our spot in line.   The doors opened promptly at 5 and we snagged spots at the bar (very little leg room), and watched the people who didn't get in . We ordered the antipasti platter, and the bread which we munched on while we waited for our 3 (yeah three!!!) pizzas. The antipasti was amazing- an interesting combinations of veggies that you don't usually see- white carrots, beets, and potatoes along with the salami, cheese and olives all drizzled with super fresh olive oil. We came just short of licking the plate!!   While we chatted with everyone at the bar, all of whom were in a great mood (probably from the thrill of getting into the place!), our works of art, also known at the Wiseguy, the Biancoverde, and the Rosa arrived. We took some ribbing from the other patrons, but we wanted to try them all! The Biancoverde was our favorite hands down- the cheese combined with the arugula fabulous. The Wiseguy boasted sweet onion that stood shoulder to shoulder with the fennel sausage and cheese. And the Rosa was intriguing with the pistachio nuts along side red onion. With all the wonderful flavors going on we didn't think to ask for red pepper or grated parmesan (don't need either one!!). We waddle out with 2 'to go' boxes, and not even complaining about the $60.00 tab!  As long as you plan ahead, bring something to do, and keep a positive attitude, Pizzeria Bianco is an absolute 'must do'!",

I have eaten pizza in Italy, where, granted, it is very good, and I grew up in New Haven, CT, pizza center of the U.S., and I can say that Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the best in the U.S. The crust is the gem, thin enough for the thin pizza lover but also doughy somehow.

They'll spend thousands of dollars to have these experiences and spend weeks of planning to do it. Well, that's not me BUT, I did decide one morning to drive  350 miles for some pizza. I had always heard how the best pizza in the world was in Phoenix, Arizona at Pizzeria Bianco. I live in Los Angeles and have experienced Mozza so many times that I couldn't believe that there was a better slice of pizza anywhere (New York and Chicago included because I've been to both). One Tuesday morning, I woke up at 5 am and decided to hop on the 10 east and settle this once and for all. Bianco is Downtown Phoenix and while it opens at 5 pm I had heard that if you don't stand in line well before then you may not get in for the rest of the night. I arrived at around 2 and there was already someone waiting at the door. In the 3 hours leading up to the door opening the line grew 40 deep and I was glad I had made the early commitment the rosa with arizona pistachios, red onion and parmigiano reggiano was a nice surprise because I didn't expect that combination to work, especially the pistachios. The Wise Guy with fennel sausage, wood roasted onions and smoked mozzarella really hit the spot. While nothing compares to Nancy Silverton's Mozza dough, Bianco's topping combinations are inspired and  perfectly balanced. The perfect pizza would be a fusion of the two and for THAT I would travel a million miles.",

On a TUESDAY night without any other major downtown events going on.  We said no to the appetizers and only later realized that the bread plates (1/4 baguette sliced) did NOT come with the meal and had to be ordered separately (for at least $5).    THE REWARD: It was heavenly pizza, but maybe only because I was so starving that I was about to kill someone!  I lived in Italy for nearly two years and have never had pizza even close to this authentic in the US.   I ordered the arugula/goat cheese pizza (\"somethingbianco\").    Food is the top. The wait is almost unendurable. The service is suboptimal.  If you really love food, it might be worth all the other difficulties.  I don't think any food is worth all of the hoops that you have jump through just to get this pizza though.  Because of this, I am giving it only three stars.",

But, if I wait 2 hours for pizza, that stuff better be divine intervention and the tomato sauce better cure cancer.   The hostess and waitress we had was stuck up and rude. That's one reason why I would hesitate to come back.  The pizza is good. I think LGO (in it's hey day) may have had pizza that competed quite favorably to it (without the wait).  The pizza was 4 stars, the service and wait (we waited 45 minutes) was a 2. Hence, my 3 rating.",

    "text": "Three years ago we stopped into this joint, only hearing about it on Oprah.  First things first, you are going to wait no matter what time of day you go unless you are the first person in line when it opens (good luck with that).   In fact, I put my  name on the wait list, then went  to watch my beloved Dodgers playing the Dbacks at Chase Field for 6 innings, then walked back and we still waited another 30 minutes!   So naturally, the question to ask is \"was it worth the wait?\"  To that I answer a resounding 100% yes!  What was impressive was that the owner Mr. Bianco was the only person who cooked every pizza ordered.  Of course he had wait staff, and he had people helping him in the kitchen, but when it came to actually placing toppings and placing the pizza in the brick oven, watching it cook and taking it out when it was ready to be served, it was all him.  I don't know if he still does this now as I heard he was cutting back for health reasons.  But back then, you talk about dedication to your craft and putting care and attention to each pizza personally, Mr. Bianco did it.  In fact, the kitchen was open for patrons to view so I actually watched him do this time and time again for every order.  It is a shame if he does not do this anymore as patrons going now are missing that TLC he provided to every pizza made which I believe makes the difference.   Getting to the pizza I had, it was freaking amazing, and I have had Tottono's NY, Lombardi's NY, Bronx Pizza in SD, and Gino's East in Chicago.   Thin crust is always a favorite for me and the crust consistency was amazing, crunchy, perfectly baked, and the toppings and sauce and cheese...well it makes my mouth water like a pavlovian dog just thinking about it now.   The dining atmosphere was also pleasant, brick themed building, seating was ample, but then again it probably felt that way because every seat was always taken.  Again, be prepared to wait, but I would suggest to do like what local Zonies do, bring some friends, some bottle of wine, find a picnic table outside and enjoy the hot AZ evenings.  (I don't know what you would do in the winter though) Or go and watch a baseball game at Chase Field (that stadium is niceee) to pass the time while waiting.    West coast pizza is well represented by this joint, but then again would you expect anything less from the Best Coast?",

I personally don't think the wait is that bad, there are tables to sit at right outside, you can spend time next door at Bar Bianco or across the way at the Rose and Crown, so at least there is something to do.  The place itself... I like the atmosphere inside, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the bathrooms are clean.  Aside from the pizza, I found the appetizers and salads to be quite enjoyable.  There isn't really much more to say at this point, but I do believe it's completely worth the wait.",

I had the massive good fortune of walking in on a Wednesday night to no line out the door whatsoever, still thanking my lucky stars for that haha.  I started out with a nice cold local IPA and the mozzarella-tomato-basil dish.  And it was extraordinary.  What's really nice is that they let you order half and half pizzas, as there was no way I could decide between the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy.  And I'm so glad I got to try both!  I honestly don't know which I would pick if I had to choose, they were both so unbelievably delicious.    Every positive thing you've heard about Pizzeria Bianco is True.  Simply amazing!",

The pizza was amazing and if I could have come back for a second time during this trip, I would have. The crust is thin and light. The proportions of toppings to crust are spot on. The ingredients are high quality and tasty.  Is this your typical NY slide on a street corner... no. It's an elevated experience without being pretentious.

Since Danny and I were on vacation we didn't mind doing that, but I can see how someone can be turned off for the wait. I had a glass of white wine and Danny had a beer. We also got personal size pizzas and shared. He got a sausage one that really enjoyed. I like it but didn't like the goat cheese. I ordered the margherita pizza and really enjoyed it as well.

Pizzeria Bianco has some interesting ingredient combinations, but most of which you can find on a build-your-own menu. They are a premium price (~$15-20 for a personal) for good quality but not great quantity (something that matters to my crew).  If you're in the mood for a dimly lit date spot, I'd recommend it.

My date and I got a seat at the bar and our awesome bartender served us promptly. He was very vey nice and fun to talk to. They've got some good beers so we ordered some while we waited for our pizza.  MARGHERITA Pretty good pizza. Not the best I've ever had, but it got the job done.  ROSA Very unique flavors. My date loved this pizza, while I wouldn't have ordered it again.   I think that the pizza here is a bit overrated, but it was good food and good service.   If you are near this place and there is no wait, definitely eat here.",

We had the Margherita & the Wiseguy pizzas. I prefer sauce on my pizzas so I liked the Margherita a little better than the Wiseguy. But easily solved by ordering a side of sauce for me. All the toppings are fresh & tasty so any you pick will be fine because the crust really makes this pizza. Old building space really fits this great pizzeria, but small. I can see why the dinner wait is long. Service was good & don't be afraid to ask for suggestions. Try getting there at 11am when they open for lunch. No waiting. Never been here for dinner. Don't think I could wait that long for great pizza.",

If it's in season, try the caprese salad. They grow their own basil and tomatoes, and make their own mozzarella. It's phenomenal.

The downside is that it is so small and the wait is so long, the servers are trying to turn the tables so quickly you don't have time enjoy the company you're dining with.  It really feels like they want you to hurry up and eat, so you can leave.  The pizza is good but not amazing and not deserving of all the hype Pizzaria Bianco has received over the years.  If you have ever eaten at Grimaldi's it is almost identical.  In my opinion, the best pizza in AZ is Oregano's; Their all meat pizza is on a level all by itself.",

The sausage on the wiseguy was outstanding although I wish it came with red sauce.  Huge cuts of onions. 2. Half rosa and half sonny boy - Rosa was so different and amazingly good at first.  I loved how different it was. However, as the pizza cooled down, the cheese (naturally) became rubbery and the pistachio's salty.  The sonny boy was average.",

You can sit at a table, order a drink and/or appetizer or play one of their board games on a small table to the left of the front door. A medium pizza is $12 or $13 and when I added prosciutto, $6 was added. The sign for parking states $5 and remind customers that this does not include a tip! The pizza is better than average but the slices are the limp kind that can be folded in half when eating. I prefer a more crispy crust. Fun place to go every once in a while.

The menu is HIGHLY limited and the service is average. ( they were bussing our table before we were finished and took my plate WHILE I was eating). We live in Chicago and have been in the pizza business for over 20 years, so I suppose we were expecting more. The crust was soggy but the ingredients were fresh, which was good. My 9 dollar glass of wine was okay, but not worth the money. Also, if your child likes juice or chocolate milk, they have none. Just coke, coke light (not diet), iced tea and sprite. I would never go there and wait 1 or 2 hours.  In an area that is in desperate need for good pizza, I guess this is a winner. However, we will not return. It is also VERY pricy for what they have to offer.",

I was introduced to the Pizzeria back in oh, 1995 or so when one of my co-workers mentioned something about this little pizza joint that was getting rave reviews in the NY Times or something like that and he had to find it and try it for himself, so a group of about 10 of us went searching for it for dinner that night.    It took us awhile to find it as it wasn't nearly as famous back then as it is now, and GPS and cell phones weren't invented yet so we had to rely on paper maps and phone booths (I know, some of you younger folks are scratching your head and saying what's that?).    What we found was a very small place with a bar and wood fired oven, and a very long wait.  I was skeptical of course, I mean, how good could something as simple as a pizza be to be worthy of an hour wait?  Well, I was pleasantly surprised and to this day it's the best pizza I've ever had.  As others have mentioned don't expect the usual pizza fare here, although in this day and age the ingredients aren't nearly as unique and surprising as they were to us 18 years ago!     I think we got at least one of each of their pizzas as it was a fairly limited selection.  The thin crust pizza from a wood fired oven, smokey mozzarella and fresh mushrooms and veggies, fennel sausages on an olive based pie with no tomato sauce was just awesome and nothing like I'd tasted before.  I recall we ordered an insalata caprese which at the time I'd never heard of, and it's since become one of my favorite salads to make.  I haven't had the chance to get back there in a few years but the Pizzeria Bianco is definitely on my list of places to visit when I'm back in the area.  I see the owner has opened some other restaurants in Phoenix now so I suppose those will be on my list to try too!",

That is not saying they are not kid friendly but its a very small place to have little ones who have the attention span of a gnat.  If you have time and you like sitting in the wine bar next door?

They were both very good but not what I had worked up in my head based on all the press they get and maybe that is my fault.

    "text": "I must start off by saying I LOVE pizza! Probably one of my favorite foods and because I travel a lot for work I always try to check out the local pizza place. Ever since moving to Tempe 2 years prior I had seen that Pizzeria Bianco was a highly rated pizza place in Phoenix. Over 1k reviews and a famous chef...needless to say I had been wanting to go here in a bad way, but just never had found the time or a reason to go. Pizza craving kicked in and in no mood to cook...this was the day! Woot! When we arrived I was surprised to see how small the place is. I had heard there are long lines to get in and now I could understand why. We got there at the perfect time though and were seated immediately. It was an early dinner. Needless to say that before we left, the line started forming outside. As we were seated we were handed the menu. Is this all? 1 page? Ok well that definitely makes it easier to order. Only 6 pizza choices really? At first this seems disappointing, but keep in mind these are 6 pizzas that you probably wont see at most places. Hmm even though there were only 6, I wanted to try all of them! Dang it! Our solution was to order 2 pizzas and get them both half and half...4 flavors covered! These are the 4 we tried: SONNY BOY (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives); MARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil); MARINARA (Tomato Sauce, Oragano, Garlic (No Cheese)); and WISEGUY (Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage). I didn't get to try the Biancoverde or the Rosa, but I vow to go back for those. All 4 pizza flavors were great, but the one that stood out the most was the Sonny Boy. My only complaint is the price of the pizza. Yes it was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had and they weren't huge pizzas. Pizza in places like New Haven, CT is just as good, yet much cheaper. Or I've even been to Neopolitan pizza places that had amazing pizza for a lower price. I feel that they charge you a premium for the Bianco brand experience of pizza. With that being said I would go back as I still haven't found anything better in Phoenix.",

I was watching an interview with Nancy Silverton and the interviewer asked her where she had gotten the inspiration for her own pizza crust. She said it came from eating at both Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix and from a bakery in Rome, called Forno, where Jim Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery in NYC worked for several months. So, inevitably I had to go there this weekend. Went on Saturday, late afternoon to the location on Heritage Square and not only had the most amazing Rosa pizza (Red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and AZ Pistachios), but ran into celebrity Chef Marcus Samuelsson who was also enjoying a pie!",

I liked that they have a bar next door for people to have a drink while waiting for a table if it's busy. We ordered a couple beers, the IPA on draft and a canned one named Valley Beer. We also tried the Rosa pizza which was DELICIOUS! Would definitely check this place out again if downtown.",

Not only was it perfectly thin, crisp, and lightly burnt, it had incredible crumb texture in the outer crust and an wonderful flavor that I have rarely found with any bread. For me the toppings, though excellent, did not come to the other-worldly level of the crust.  They were very good, fresh, and creative in the case of the Rosa.  We had the Margherita, Rosa, and Biancoverde, with sausage on half the Margherita.  My favorite pizza toppings are the veggy pizzas at the Gastropub in Albany NY that use preserved lemon - the combo of this crust and those toppings would be my ultimate. Beauitiful building, great service, nice atmosphere.  A win at many levels.",

It's located right by the Science Center gate and there's a guard that wont' let you drive through, but there's a small parking lot just for Pizzeria Bianco.   I visited on a Tuesday at around 11:45 with 1 other friend and the place was almost full.  We started off with the the Spiedini which is a fontina wrapped in proscuitto on a skewer.  It had the right amount of bite to it.  They also brought out some house bread with some olive oil.  We definitely cranked out some pepper on top of it and we couldn't stop eating that.  The salami sandwich was a big portion, glad we ordered this as well.  With the sandwich being cut in half you can see all the different components that came together.  Since we couldn't decide on a pizza we were told the Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy were the popular choices.  And any of the other options without protein on it could always be added on with an extra cost.  We stuck with the margherita and it was great.  Food came out fairly quickly.  The service is great and the staff is attentive with refilling drinks and checking up on you.  The menu isn't a phone book like many other places so you can tell they've perfected the ones that they have listed on their menu.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all True - it is fabulous!  LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).    FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!        SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive!   I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)",

When we originally came here to just do takeout, the hostess was quick to respond that they weren't doing takeout orders, what's that about?! We ended up finding a seat @ the bar. Ordered a appetizer, a drink & pizza to go. We couldn't enjoy our meal due to the size of the place (claustrophobia) and the hostess walking back and forth looking @ what we were ordering/eating. It was a uncomfortable dining experience. A place trying to be hip but is trying way to hard. Parking is limited in downtown Phx, there's valet, pssshhh. I've had far much better food/pizza than what Pizzeria Bianco had to offer. Tried it and that will be my last.",

    "text": "The hype of being one of the best pizzerias in the U.S. is tough to live up to. In my multiple experiences of visiting this location and the second one near the Biltmore, I have no reason to doubt it. For my money, it's certainly the best pizza I've had.   A quick note on the restaurant itself, it's pretty small inside. I would guess it could hold, at most, around 50 people. There are usually always waits but in my experience, the lunch hour is the best time to visit the original location. If you do decide to brave the wait for dinner, there is a bar that they run next door that serves alcohol and some small plates to ease the wait.  Now, onto the pizza. I've tried all the pizzas on the menu and the two that I recommend most are the Margarita and Wiseguy. Both having different appeal, the Margarita is superb. The tomato sauce is fresh, juicy, and not too sweet. The mozzarella cheese is easily the best I've ever had on a pizza - smooth, firm, and properly salted, it is a wonder on its own merit. Finally, there's the crust, crisp and bubbled on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Combine the three elements together with fresh basil leaves on top and for me, it's the best pizza there is.  As for the Wiseguy, any meat lovers will adore this masterpiece. A white pizza, this one features fennel sausage and roasted onions along with the aforementioned mozzarella. Both the sausage and onion carry a smoky flavor that is enhanced by the smooth creaminess of the mozzarella. This applies to both pizzas but I highly recommend adding garlic to the pizza for an added flavor dimension.   Overall, this is easily the best pizza in Arizona, with apologies to Pomo, Cibo, and Federal. As for the best in the country, perhaps that's a better question for someone with extensive experience. For me though, I see no reason to doubt the claim.",

I asked if possible to do takeaway ordering and was told they were on wait and no takeaway ordering. We went out and waited by the host stand and he rudely came out and said it was 45 minute wait. Since there were empty tables inside and out we said no, his response was \"fair enough!\" And huffed off. I'm sure the food is good, if you can get it.",

It was mid-afternoon and we thought it wouldn't be as busy as we had heard about the loong wait times.  We were wrong!! The place was packed and we had to wait outside in the 100+ heat.  The place is tiny and there is literally no extra room to wait for a table to open up.  As we didn't want to walk any more we decided to wait it out. It was worth it though.  We shared a Margherita and a Rosa.  Both were delicious.  The dough really makes the pizza.  We ended up sitting at the bar with the kids and the bartender was really sweet with them and gave them buttons with their logo on it.  We'll definitely have to give the one in Tucson a try the next time we're in downtown.",

I'm more than happy to wait an hour plus if the food is incredible, especially for a good pizza.  Friend and I sat inside at bar. Warm and comfy inside with classic dark romantic or classic interior depending on how you view it. Either way it's comfy and pleasant.  Pizza was Neapolitan style, I decided to order three. Two red sauces and their popular one with no sauce. I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza here, just pick one or ask for advice from the waiter. Bottom line - 4.5 stars Crust - 4.5 stars Sauce - 4.5 stars Toppings - 4.5 stars Cooked to perfection factor -4.75 stars Overall I give the pizza (all 3) - 4.5 stars. One of the best I've had anywhere, probably the best on the west side of the country that I've had. Desserts such as flourless chocolate cake is probably in the 3.75 star range. Don't get excited. Stick to the pizza, it's really good, not the best in the country in my opinion. I'll give it 4.5 stars and drop it to 4 stars instead of 5 for the review for the slightly better than average dessert and feeling that the pizza is just slightly under 5 stars.",

Their white pizza comes with no sauce at all; it was good but I am glad I did half and half and paired it with a red sauce pizza.  Our experience was marred by rude behavior on the part of the staff as we waited for them to open.  The first person who opened the door demanded to know if we were waiting to eat. He didn't want us hanging around outside under the restaurant awning.    The second person to open the door was outright angry that we were sitting on the chairs while we waited because \"they were stacked for a reason.\" We cheerfully offered to restack them for her and she huffed off.  We restacked them just as we found them and she walked out after 11 and unstacked them.    There was much discussion outside about the restaurant not needing to be polite to customers because their pizza is so good.  I disagree.  A good restaurant is good on all points from service to food. I've tried their pizza and it was good but I don't need to return and reward rudeness.",

There were 4 in our party so we ended up ordering the Margherita, Wiseguy, Rosa and Biancaverde.  The only pizza that we all felt wasn't that great was the Rosa.  It had a few cheeses on top plus AZ pistachios.  It just wasn't flavorful and was quite dry.  The wine paired with the pizzas was great.    Service was exceptional!

We wanted to take some family members to try it after a Diamond back game. We get there, there is no line outside and it didn't look full inside. I asked the gentlemen who came out if he could host 8 people. Mind you we knew they closed at 9pm and we were there around 7:55pm. The guy told us that it would take an 1hr and 15mins to sit us. I then asked if we could be seated outside since all the tables were empty. He then followed to say that they were only seating people inside. We felt like he just didn't want to take the time to host us because he didn't want to deal with us. There was still an hour left. Enough sits and we had a crew that was willing to try things from their menu. We left very disappointed. We felt like they could have seated us. I can not review their food on this location but we will most likely not be recommending this location to anyone. Poor customer service.",

From the farm fresh salad, Dos Cabezas wine, to the gourmet rosemary and pistachio pizza it was unbelievable. The grounds that surround you are vintage Phoenix full of history and character.  Bar Bianco next door  is the perfect accompaniment for this venue. Wine, spirits, and fantastic roasted vegetables and cheese plates prepare you for the upcoming experience. The husband and wife that run the bar are reminiscent of old world tavern host and hostess.  This was a wonderful and memorable experience. I recommend it to all.",

However, since it was my day off, and they were just around the corner from the Arizona Science Center, I went head and took a gander.  I wasn't really that hungry so I ordered the smallest pizza on their menu. I chose the Marinara, which is a 12\" pizza with marinara sauce on a crust with no cheese. It took some adjusting, but it was actually delicious. I didn't really miss the cheese, and I actually got to enjoy the crust even more than normal. I really did enjoy it!  I emphasize that because the waitress thought that I didn't enjoy my meal because I only ate two slices. I proceeded to explain to her that I wasn't really that hungry and I was also in a hurry. What I didn't tell her was that I also got several phone calls from work that was an unwelcome interruption and that pretty much ruined my appetite for anything after that.  In any case, it was a good lunch repast, and was well worth the $15 (including drinks) that I paid for it.  I am going to try to eat her again when my schedule is less obtrusive and I am much more ravenous. Perhaps then, I will really get to enjoy their offerings.",

I attempted on a weekend evening and not a chance. 3 hour wait was not gonna happen for me. The wife and I made another attempt during the early afternoon and was delighted to have no wait. We got right in and started to gaze upon the menu with thoughts of this magical pie wafting its way to our table.   While we waited for our pizza to arrive I took the time to look over the old brick building and this place had a great atmosphere. With all the wood and brick I got the feeling of comfort and old world artisanal craftsmanship. Like a place out of time....especially in an Arizona desert.  We ended up ordering the Margherita and the Wiseguy ($15 & $18 respectively). Both pizzas came straight out of the hot brick oven and to our table. As we devoured the pies before us I have to say that the wife and I were quite happy. Both were cooked well and very flavorful. I would recommend either. It was a pleasure to have nice wait staff as well.  Final verdict: I would highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco. Its not thee best pizza in the valley but a pretty damn good one. Both pizzas we had were really tasty. I would also recommend going there shorty after they open in the afternoon. It is a far less wait. If you want to make a day of it go for the weekend evenings. They have a wine bar next door for you to enjoy.",

    "text": "If you have the time to wait for a seat, Pizzeria Bianco is something every pizza lover should experience at least once. The pies are that good.  The 43-seat restaurant in Old Town Phoenix is nationally known and the crowds outside prove it. You will need to get there around 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon to line up for a seat or you may be left waiting until after 6:30pm for the second seating. Really. If you get there after 3:00pm, forget about being in the first group of patrons.  While you wait, Bar Bianco offers drinks and there are a few places to escape the hot Arizona sun. Most people are nice enough to let you back in line if you need to move, so bring a good attitude and make friends with your line-mates. It will help, believe me.  The pizza is crafted in a wood-fired oven which, legend has it, was delivered from Italy brick-by-brick and rebuilt on site. The meats offered are gourmet and can be a tad salty. The other toppings and the cheese are also high in quality. The oven creates a wonderfully caramelized crust that the uneducated might call \"burned.\" However, that's their problem...the crust is perfect.  I prefer the Sonny Boy, which has Salami and Olives, or the standard Margherita. However, the handful of other pizzas are equally as good. You might want to order two and take what's left home versus finishing and needing to order another pie.  If you're there during baseball season, you can walk to Chase Field to catch a Diamondbacks game...and you can park in the garage in between the two locations.",

The pizzas are incredibly small for the price and there are better pizzas to be found right here in Phoenix that are less expensive and you won't have to wait a few hours to eat.  The pizza itself is fine, it's not horrible or anything but it most certainly doesn't live up to the hype. The small space and huge demand means the tables are very close to each other.  If you are looking to a semi-private conversation over dinner, this isn't the place.

Most of the people who eat here don't have reservations, which means waiting in line for hours, even after you get your name on the list, you have to wait longer. So most people go over to the bar next door and drink, if you think  about it, by the time you  get your pizza you have waited at least 3 or more hours, and more than likely are drunk. Combine that with the preconceived notions they have already heard about this place, it makes for one amazing pizza.  Now I'm not trying to hate on this place at all, but it is just so overrated. The pizza was really good, the customer service was horrible, price was okay. My friends and I had reservations and ended up not getting a table until 30 minutes after our reservations were supposed to start. If you have a ton of time on your hands I recommend it, but your not missing too much. I have heard that Cibo pizza is actually better, and you don't have to wait in a ridiculous  line.",

Chris Bianco is an artist with a pizza oven, something to behold. No wonder he's won a James Beard and is noted as the best pizza in the US.  If you are as fascinated with pizza as my wife and I, you can't miss this one. Put your name in, get a bottle of wine, and relax. When your table is ready, ask the server what to order.

I was especially skeptical since, after spending a summer in Italy, I haven't been able to find any pizza that rivals a True Italian pie. So, Saturday night, I braced myself for a super long wait to get some good (not great) pizza.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. To start, the weather could not have been more beautiful. We've finally gotten a little taste of Fall! I'm sure it will be yanked away before we know it and we'll have to endure a little bit more summer, but this weekend was glorious. Sitting on the front patio of Bar Bianco while waiting for a table was anything but a \"wait\". It was a great time, with good drinks and friends! To those of you who stand around in a drab lobby for an hour to eat at Olive Garden and then complain about a \"two hour wait\" at this cute bar, you're insane.  On to dinner. Oh my. Our table had two Margherita, one Wiseguy and one Rosa. Each was amazing in their own way, but the sausage on the Wiseguy was incredible and everything about the Rosa was perfect. You have got to try these two. I think I may have dreamt about the Rosa that night... Onion and parmesan and PISTACHIOS!  Overall, I was super impressed with Bianco, mostly because it actually DID live up to all of the hype. Gotta love that.",

This restaurant was a recommendation from a local here who told me that Pizzeria Bianco is well-known throughout the country (not sure if this is True), which put it on my list of \"must-try.\" Eh, not super-impressed. Maybe because its reputation is a lot to live up to. Their pizza is good, but very expensive. The dining area is small, and they only seat complete parties. If you have a straggler in your group, you will get bumped down the seating chart until they arrive. There is a bar in one of the buildings next door that serves wine and tapas for you to wait in the AC which is nice. It has a bigger seating area which makes me wonder why the restaurant and the bar can't just switch... The service here is good. They made a mistake on my pizza. Since it was a small one, I wasn't going to say anything but they came with a corrected order and boxed up the mistake pizza, which I got to take home. Nice, 2 pizzas for the price of one. Made the $18 more worth it. I live super close and was going to pick up an order to take home and avoid the dining in madness---no take out orders! Dining in only! Really?! Also, there's parking, but valet only unless you can find somewhere on the street nearby. It costs $3 that you pay for with your meal.",

    "text": "Alright, let's move beyond the whole best-pizza-in-the-country conversational paradigm for just a ding-dang minute, folks.  This restaurant has created a wonderful way to enjoy your meal, something that is truly (and sadly) unique in Phoenix.  The long wait becomes an opportunity to relax - to slow down, and sip wine in a charming cottage, on a grass lawn, surrounded by historic brick houses, in the shadow of the modernist science center.  The wine and beer list is well-curated, the staff is attentive, and the carefree pace continues throughout the night.  Once seated, you are served in an environment that is casual but respectful.  Last time I went, the couple at the table next to us got their check 15 minutes after we sat down - and they were still there when we left.  The food isn't always impeccable - and where else is it, at $12-15 a person?  But the ingredients are always fresh, the dough is delicious even when soggy, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.  Honestly, it's something people don't talk about enough.  This is a place that is heralded as (at least one of) the best pizza places in the country, and a schlub like me can afford to take my beautiful wife.  We can both enjoy a glass of wine, a night under the stars, and delicious pizza for under $50.  Well done, Pizzeria Bianco.  Well done.  If you are coming here with your guard up, daring them to impress you, and aren't willing to slow down and embrace the whole experience, go to Cibo or Parlor or something.  That's not a knock on them, I'm just saying - if you can't take it down a notch, don't be a party pooper.",

Unfortunately we were not as excited after the meal as we were going in.  The outer crust was cooked perfect but the bottom crust was not crispy and a little soggy so picking it up was difficult. If you have to put parmesan and peppers on a pizza it's missing flavor to stand on its own.  The pizza itself was pretty good and I would do it again if not for the seating process where every person needs to be present to sit, valet parking, the bar at the house next store and the tiny little room to sit. There's a lot of good pizza places and this is above average,  but not really amazing.",

We ordered 3 pizzas for 4 adults and 1 child. Had some leftovers.  The beer and wine list is extensive with plenty of good offerings.  The appetizers are good also. Cheese plate could hv been bigger but very tasty. The olive order was definitely very good and a good portion.  Unless you arrive early you'll have to wait depending on the size of your party. We waited 45min.  They really should build another oven in the bungalow next door versus sending people over there to wait.  They'd be just as busy but they'd get people in n out quickly. Thru hv the space to do it. But maybe they just want to stay a small operation.  My wife would go back but maybe not if the wait is over 30mins. I think you can get thin crispy artisan pizza from a lot of restaurants throughout the valley.  ie. parlor, Grimaldi's etc.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go here for yearsssssssssss.  Typically when a restaurant has that much hype, you would expect to pay a ton of money to eat there, but I knew the pizza here is not crazy expensive, so I have no idea what held me back for so long.   So finally, on my b-day weekend, my girlfriend Abby treated me to Pizzeria Bianco, a place she been wanting to try out for a while as well.   As I'm sure many of the reviews probably already note, this place is now open for lunch. We went about 1:30 pm on a Friday and were able to grab a seat right away at the bar. The place stayed busy the whole time, even when we left at 3:00 pm, but you wouldn't have to wait more than a couple minutes for a table.   I started out with one of their draft beers, not too impressed so I switched to San Tan on the next one. I loved the coziness of the place, and completely understand why there would be such a long wait in the evenings.   I had the Wiseguy pizza and Abby had the Sonny Boy. Over all pretty good. I think we were both expecting to have some light shine down on us from heaven and the bartender bust out some harps as we took our first bite. The pizza was good, and in any other place I would be overly impressed but I think the years of hype stole away some of the pizza's thunder. I actually like La Bocca Urban Pizzeria better. Hope that don't break any of your hearts hearing that.  Everyone should go at least one time. I wouldn't mind coming back again as well, I wish I could go before Suns games. I could probably add my name to the list before the game and get seated after!   Protip: If you just want to try this place out, go for lunch. If you have time (and money) to burn, it would be a fun experience to drink next door for a couple hours, then eat some tasty fresh pizza.",

    "text": "I've been a handful of times now.  All I've had is the pizza, but I've had most of the menu (not difficult with only 6 choices).  The last time I went my friends added additional items which didn't improve their pizzas.  The positives -- good crust and fresh organic ingredients  The negatives -- poor pizza design, poor execution, long lines  One bit of good news is that Pizzeria Bianco is now open for lunch.  The last two times I've eaten here there was no line; both were afternoon meals.  The lines are still long in the evenings.  I like the crust, as overly thin and slightly burnt as it might be.  And I appreciate the organic ingredients.  But they just don't taste very good.  The Margherita and Biancoverde, two pizza styles I normally love, are just kind of boring.  Supplemental ingredients (expensive to add and the restaurant actually adds too much of them to your pizza) don't help.  The Sonny Boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isn't desirable, and the Wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of its parts.  But in addition to the flawed pizza design, I've experienced inconsistency in the pizzas I've had.  The same pizza can taste substantially different on different visits.  Some might argue something about each pizza being unique because they are made by hand, but my experience is that it is simply poor execution.  One last item.  This didn't contribute to the review, but is worth noting.  This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had \"the next day\".  Whether eaten cold or reheated (something I do with a lot of pizza), it is borderline inedible.  Not a requirement for a good pizza place, bur don't over-order because your take home portions will just go into the trash.",

    "text": "When it comes to top 5% of anything, especially something subjective like food, moreso with classics such as pizza, burgers and bbq, it comes down to personal preferences. Claims such as 'best in US', as this place's been tagged by many, is in the mouth of the beholder.   Since this was (relatively) close to wife & I's recent trip to the Grand Canyon, thought we'd stop by and check it out.   Taking advice of other Yelpers, we got there at 4pm to make the wait 'only' a hour. Sitting in 107 degree heat is no fun, but the anticipation and sips of IPA from bar next door made it tolerable.   It's located in a nice courtyard in downtown, with parking structure nearby.   Doors finally open and we were seated in a small yet clean and functional dining area with open kitchen and Italian pizza oven as the centerpiece.   We scanned the menu and quickly decide on antipasto plate, Rosa and Wiseguy pizzas.   Antipasto was really good, very sweet, flavorful veggies and savory pieces of sopressata and cheese.   Now finally the pizza. We had high expectations with all the hype, and it met them, which does not happen often. Crust is the foundation for great pizza, and this was a grand slam, thin but not too thin, crisp and slightly charred and smoky on the outside, chewy, yeasty, moist, and delicate at the same time. Quality, delicious and unique topping combos that work together, parm and pistachios, and smoked mozz and fennel sausage in our case. We both agreed that overall it's the best overall pizza either of us ever had to date, better than in Italy. Even though our(her) gut was about to burst, we wanted more! I'm still thinking about it.   Staff is courteous and service was efficient. I highly recommend a bottle of local brown ale while wolfing down slices, tasty brew even though it's not on tap.  I only give out 5* to special places, and this is one of them.   Place to try before you die? Yes, a must.",

    "text": "*Sigh*   I can hardly believe it, but I finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco, one of America's most famous and highly rated pizzerias.   After 5 different and failed attempts to try a slice of Oprah's favorite pizza, I contemplated a plan to get in by calling on behalf of a cancer stricken girl with only a month to live and one dream: To eat at Pizzeria Bianco.   Instead, I took someone's advice and made sure I got there early on a Friday night. And when I say early, I mean not early enough because at 3:45pm, there were already 50 people ahead of me. Estimated wait time? 2 hours!!! And did I mention I got there at 3:45pm and his doors don't even open until 5pm?   2.5 hours later...to be exact, I was seated. Browsing through the simple menu, I decided to start with the Spiedini. The Italian Fontina cheese wrapped in Prosciutti was a little too rich for me. As for the pizzas-did you catch the plural? I decided to order all 6, yes 6 of the listed pizzas.   I figured the chances of me waiting another 3 hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco were slim to none so I better order all of them and get it done! Efficiently, with the help of my BF, we finished 4.5 26\" pizzas out of the 6 pizzas in one seating (the Margherita, Marinara, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy). Told you I could throw down :) The tables beside us were either disgusted or shocked. Out of the 6, my favorite was the Marinara pizza. It stole my heart with its boastful, yet simple flavors of just 3 ingredients-tomato, garlic and oregano. The Rosa was my least favorite because of the overwhelming amount of onions. Being a meat lover, I was disappointed with the protein shakes...I mean pizzas. They were Hoover-daming and drenched with oil. Not sure if they're always like that or if it was just our order? I prefer my pizzas to be moist, not drenched.   Overall, Pizzeria Bianco has amazing dough and tasty pizzas. I don't think it lives up to its hype taking into consideration the ridiculous wait time and my hunger pangs. But it IS an experience-to be able to try such a famous restaurant located in our own backyard. I'd return...as long as someone else stands in line. I've already taken one for the team.",

Last time, we waited for 2-3 hours before getting a seat.  This wasn't totally unpleasant as there are picnic tables outside and the opportunity to get drinks/appetizers from the bar next store.  This time we showed up and were seated right away.    As with last time, my favorite pizza was the biancoverde.  Both times I ordered it with prosciutto as an extra topping.  As I recall, last time they had baked the pizza without the arugula and prosciutto until it was almost done, then taken it out to add the prosciutto and arugula and cooked it for another mintue or so.  This time they reversed the order for the final two toppings, adding the arugula and then the prosciutto.  The consequence was that the arugula was under the prosciutto and stayed pretty wet.  Oh well.  Pizzas are expensive.  $20 or so per person.",

The pizzas came out quickly, and the ingredients were fresh, but that's as far as it goes.  If it's a new concept to you and you're used to greasy Pizza Hut pizza, you'll probably love the change.  For us, it was nothing out of the ordinary.  The wait is long and might only be worth it if you can't get similar style pizza elsewhere.  Although they say it's first-come-first serve, they'll seat whichever group will fill up the table fully and pass over smaller groups even if their name is next on the list.  The quickest way to get a seat seemed to be if you come as a pair.  If you have a group of 3+, best bet is to arrive at around 3:15 you'll probably get in during the first seating so it'll only be a 1h45m in the end.  With Bar Bianco opening up at 4 with reasonable prices for drinks, thats the best way to go if you must try this place out.",

I have been twice over the years and would definitely go back if given the opportunity.    Expect to wait!!!  Pizzeria Bianco has their system down.  They open for dinner only and people get there early (like 2 hours early) and wait in line.  When they open the doors, they take you in order.  If you are not towards the front of the line, don't think you will get seated first round because this place is SMALL!  Your name then gets put on \"the list\" and you are free to wander about for a couple hours.  I have heard of people coming to downtown to watch a baseball game (the stadium is walking distance) and they put their name in at Pizzeria Bianco first, go watch the game, and then make it back in time for the reservation.  Genius!  Other than the wait, you MUST like THIN CRUST pizza.  Chicago style lovers beware.  You will not get your usual carb overload here.  Sorry.    This pizza is made fresh with really fresh ingredients.  They don't mess around.  And don't think you can order extra pizzas to take home.  It's not allowed - at least not when I was there.  This of this place similar to the \"Soup Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld.  \"No pizza for you!!\"  I will definitely love to go back if I can find someone willing to wait with me.",

When he moved downtown we tried to follow him for an occasional pie, but it got to be impossible. Major foodies were Dubbing Bianco, Best in the West...the country...the world. The lines were 2 hours for the very few seats. People started sharing reservation and line trading strategies. We went a couple of times and it was very good, but for me the best times were just before closing at the Town and Country, listening to Chris talk about wood-fired ovens and the search for perfection. If you haven't tried it, you owe it to yourself. Turn in your name, go to the Science Museum, come back have your pizza and file it in your memory. It's that good, but I have to wonder whether its as good as the memory",

The servers are extremely friendly and you can tell that the staff enjoy what they do(staff turnover at this restaurant is low).  The pizzeria is known for having long lines, especially Thurs-Sat, so I would recommend going on the off days.

Definitely NOT! Their new location on Camelback is a faster deal for sure, but the greeting hostesses and some of the waiters carry an attitude as if they are doing customers a favor by seating them or serving them!

When the \"blonde woman\" came out to start a list I overheard her arguing with a family that should've gone in first but was being pushed aside. This place is very small...people obviously love the pizza but perhaps they should be happy that they have a thriving business and should not be rude to their loyal customers. It was a turn off for me and it makes me not want to go back...you're not curing cancer, you're serving pizza.",

The atmosphere is that of a little cafe in Italy, but with an incredible view of the brick oven and the pizzas being made. Whether you're sitting outside admiring the lovely surroundings , or sitting inside enjoying the adorable rustic decor, you are sure to be pleased, and served promptly no matter how busy! I absolutely love the margarita pizza, but they're all delectable. I would definitely ask your sever for their recommendations as well, as some of the best ones I tried I would never think to order myself.",

We were treated like absolute crap by the management during our lunch. There was a woman who kept glaring at us the entire time we sat and ate. Our kids didn't even make a peep until about 5 min before leaving and even then they made a few sounds and we told them no and they stopped. Not to mention there was no one else in the restaurant at the time. We felt so uncomfortable the entire time that we didn't even finish our food because the woman and the staff stared at us and gossiped and rolled there eyes up at us. Our kids were very well behaved, weren't throwing all their food on the floor and weren't screaming or crying. We rushed to leave the place and I won't be back. Our waiter was nice, the pizza was okay and that's about it. As we were gathering our things to leave, another family was preparing to walk in and the same woman rolled her eyes and looked pissed that they were going to have 3 kids under 5 in the restaurant. Again it was empty at the time, this isn't Fleming's where small kids aren't welcome & you treat your customers well unless they are treating you poorly.",

    "text": "I'm going to admit, this place was not on my radar when I was yelping for places to eat in Phoenix. I have NO idea how this passed through my filters as I was searching for good eats on my vacation. Luckily for me, I have a friend who \"stalks\" celebrities online and somehow came upon a picture of Jimmy Fallon eating here. In short, thanks to my stalking friend, I found a great gem in Phoenix!  We came here at around 7pm on New Year's Day and were met with a 2 hour wait. Not surprising, but we were hungry. Luckily for us, they have a holding area next door with small bites and drinks. We ordered a few appetizers: marinated olives, a cheese plate, and the crostini plate. Standard apps and nothing to write home about. The crostini with the goat cheese was our favorite. We passed the time with a game of Scrabble. They have other games floating around the place.  Before we knew it, our name was called and we were ready for dinner. The place is small and could probably fit 40-50 people max. It was darkly lit, but felt warm and inviting.   For 6 ladies, we ordered 2 salads and 4 pizzas to share. The crust is crisp and the wood fire creates this amazing smoky flavor.   Margherita with prosciutto - great sauce and well balanced flavors. One of my favorites that night.   The Rosa - red onion, pistachios, and parm - interesting combo and a must try. Really tasty!  wise guy - onions and sausage. I was surprised I didn't like this as much. It was a little sweeter than I'd like. The flavors just didn't do it for me.  Sonny Boy - tomato sauce, salami, and olives - good, but totally nothing super special.  Overall, I'd say the pizzas are tasty! The wait is crazy, but worth it if you're visiting. I probably wouldn't wait here for 2 hours if I lived in the area. The dough/crust is something worth mentioning though and I'd play around with the different toppings to get something that suits your taste buds.",

PHX has grown into a legitimate pizza hub in the last few years and there are some great spots that offer comparable pizza and a better all around experience (i.e., parking, getting a table, good climate control, not feeling rushed to leave because someone is waiting for your table). Overall, this is good pizza, and I will reserve my final judgement until after I've had a chance to visit the other location (I am willing to admit that my current review may be biased by the heat of the PHX summer and the frustrations of trying to get food at a popular place without feeling rushed).",

I've been to Pizzeria Bianco on several occasions and the food and service  live up to all the hype.   All the entree's at Pizzeria Bianco are delicious.  However, my favorites are the caprese salad, Sonny boy pizza with a glass of wine, what a perfect meal.  The taste, texture and flavors of the woodfired oven pizza is second to none. I understand why there is usually a wait when going to Pizzeria Bianco. So if you get frustrated while waiting in line, which is a normal nightly occurance, I suggest going on the off-hours. If you're in the area give Pizzeria Bianco a try and then you can say \"I had some of the best pizza in the US\"",

I guess the first thing to start with is that if you don't show up to put your name on the list before this place opens up you can forget about having anywhere near a normal dining experience.  This was our second time there and the first nearly ruined it.  We originally stumbled across this place on a recommendation by some friends that swear it's the best in the country.  It top notch and definitely in the hunt for the top 5, but the wait and process takes a lot from it.    Normally you'd expect a place that is packed with a waiting list from open to close to want to expand, but this is exactly the reason that this place will always be this way.  You see... They own a little wine bar adjacent that dishes out beer, wine and appetizers to all those waiting to eat there.  And from sitting at the first seating and hearing people told a 3 plus hour wait from the hostess, I feel their pain.  Onto the food... Their fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and olive was good and highlighted by the top quality olive oil found atop this concotion.  For the pizzas, we have done the same the last two times there - the wiseguy (carmalized onions, fennel sausage on a tomato sauceless pizza) and the biancoverde (ricotta arugula and cheese on a tomato sauceless pizza as well) except we always add the proscutto di parma to it.  Both were terrific and yielded leftovers for us.  In fact, I think the only tomato sauced pizza is the margherita.    If you plan it right and eat an early dinner or at least plan to stop in near 5 to put youself in the queue, you should enjoy this True Italian style pizza that is so hard to find here in the states.",

You wait (just like everyone else) in the wine bar next door. They don't take reservations. You can't do take out. You wait. And you drink while you wait. By the time we finished our 2nd drinks, our table was ready... and we were really hungry.. and that made the food taste even better.   Make sure to order enough to take home... between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 3 pizzas: The Rosa (it has pistachios on it. and that may freak you out, but take a chance --- it's the best pizza I've ever had).  The Margherita (classic).  The Wise guy (for the meat eaters in your group -- not for me).   I love that the owner works the stove. It's a great experience.. maybe food shouldn't be instant.",

I am not sure this place would be worth waiting for, so go during the off peak times. The service was ok, but not fabulous. As empty as it was, you would think it would have been impeccable.

    "text": "First some background for context.   One of the two of us who contributed to this review is of 100% Italian heritage and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NY. Pizzeria Bianco was recommended to us by another couple who are long time friends, who used to live in Paradise Valley and who ate at Bianco frequently. They are \"foodies\" whose judgement in food we trust and the husband is also a native New Yorker with 100% Italian heritage. So, when they highly recommended Bianco, we were looking forward to great pizza. And since great pizza is among the world's most perfect food, we didn't even mind the long wait we knew would be a part of eating at Bianco.   BUT...well, we felt completely duped by this experience.   The pizza just was not that good. And it certainly wasn't good enough to justify the nearly two hour wait for a table. Even if that wait was made easier by being able to sit outside on a lovely Arizona evening while enjoying a good glass of wine from the wine bar next door and getting to meet a nice family of New Yorkers, also with Italian heritage, who had come all the way from Queens to try Pizzeria Bianco.   We went in for our table ahead of them. On our way out, as they were eating their pizzas and we had finished ours, the father gestured with a big \"thumbs down\" and we said we agreed.   I guess it made us feel better because we felt very much like the little boy in the story of the Emperor who has no clothes who, while all others are admiring the Emperor's finery, cries out \"But he's nude!\"   The good news is the salad that started off the meal was delightfully fresh and dressed just right with a lovely vinaigrette. The pizza itself was just not \"all that\"...the crust was OK but burned on the outside edges. Not burned as in nicely charred, burned as in incinerated. We've had lots of good wood fired pizzas and this is not a \"requirement\". Toppings were minimal, which is a good thing to let the crust shine when the crust is great, but in this case there was just too little topping. And the poor, harried waitstaff acted as if they were doing diners a favor to let us eat there.   All in all, we're glad we tried this one time to simply experience first hand a place that was getting so much hype. But with so many really great dining options, including pizza, in the greater Phoenix area we won't be back here during our upcoming visit. Fool us once, shame on you, fool us twice...",

So my friend and I got there at 5pm on a Wed, put our names on THE LIST, headed next door for some wine, and settled on a bench outside for the 2.5 hour wait. Luckily the sun was shining, and the refreshing glass of Riesling hit the spot.   I wish I could say the time passed quickly, but it didn't. At least we were seated after 2 hours, and I will honestly say that I've never been so excited about pizza.  We ordered the farmer's market salad, the margherita pizza, and the marinara pizza with roasted mushrooms. The margherita pizza was good, but the marinara pizza made the 2 hour wait worth it. A simple cheese-less pizza with tomato sauce, oregano, and garlic, it was simply incredible.  The sauce tasted fresh and very garlicky.  The crust was thin and chewy, charred in some places, but that's to be expected when baked in a wood-fire oven. I read that Chris Bianco's favorites are the Rosa and Marinara.  Definitely with him on the Marinara. Outstanding.  I normally like thick crust pizzas, but this was the best pizza - thick or thin - that I've had. Would I wait again for it? Probably not, so if you need an extra person to make a reservation for a party of 6, give me a call.",

It's like they said \"hey,  let's take the worst flavor in sausage and make it the star!\" So the food is certainly overrated,  but there are other problems here as well. Namely,  parking.  They have one tiny lot that depending on when you go may or may not be valet only.  Since there was no other option,  we used the valet. Three dollars to watch him park our car literally fifteen feet from where we stopped. Bizzare. And then there are your fellow diners. Lots of Ed Hardy wearing dudebros when we were there. Not really our scene.  I don't think we will be back here considering there are so many better pizza joints in the valley.",

    "text": "Oh Biancos.  This isn't really a restaurant you can just say \"hey, lets go get a quick bite to eat\".  This is a commitment of time.  There are other pizza places in Phoenix, with perfectly good food.  Biancos though, it's more of an experience.  Expect to spend at least 4 hours here.  1 ish hours waiting to get on the list, and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant, then an hour of eating.  Why would you want to do that?!  Well, because it's fun.  Make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with.  Go when the weather is fantastic, and make sure you want to have some fun.  I always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from Bar Bianco, which is next door.  You can start your tab over there, and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated.  After you get on the list, the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you.  Biancos is located in a quiet, great little section of PHX where there is actual grass and trees.  So waiting will be in a park, where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers.  I always find myself, and my party chatting it up with the other people in line... we all know we are going to be there for a while, so might as well socialize.    The food is always amazing.  I've gone several times and have tried most of the menu.  My one bit of advice, always get fresh basil on your pizza.  It's an extra cost, but makes a world of difference, no matter what pizza you get.  The Margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all, it's perfection.  Just go, expect to wait, and try to make the best of it.  It'll be a great time with friends, with wine, pizza, fresh air, and that basil.  :)",

Most of the pizzas you order here will not have more than 3-4 toppings, so it is simplistic. But these are some very very delicious simplistic pizzas.   My friends and I had the mozzarella and tomatoes then ordered the Margherita, Biancoverde, and the one with sausage (can't remember the name of this pizza). Every single one of the pizzas had the right amount of cheese and the combination was thoroughly entertaining my palate.   Here's a tip: If you come for dinner here you will probably wait for over 1-2hours. But they are now open for lunch which means you can get there at 11 and get a seat right away!",

We weren't disappointed. I love Neopolitan style pizza; chewy oven fired crust with amazing toppings, just enough to showcase the flavors and freshness of the finished product. Pizzeria Bianco does this just right in Phoenix. We've been hard pressed to find a pizza restaurant in Phoenix that comes close to those in larger, more metropolitan cities, but Pizzeria Bianco could hold their own in any one of those.

    "text": "Although we had heard of Pizzeria Bianco before, my fiance and I were presently surprised to stumble upon it in Heritage Square (we'd gone into Phoenix for first night, never having been before). We'd been warned about the wait, but at a distant glance it didn't seem to busy, so we went on with our night. When we returned, we were welcomed with a 1.5 hour wait which was our fault, really. Luckily the Science Museum, adjacent to Pizzeria Bianco, was open, and we filled that hour and a half quickly. As the time got closer for our wait to end, we went next door to the wine bar, which had a decent, but small, wine and beer list. Prices weren't bad either--beer started at $4, glasses of wine ran around $8-$9.   I loved two things about Pizzeria Bianco: the food and the location.   We opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting longer for a table. We shared (and finished all in one seating) a caprese salad (good, fresh, airy mozzarella), the margherita pizza, and the pizza rosa. I favored the margherita pizza, my fiance favored the pizza rosa. Both had good, chewy thin crust. The pizza rosa was a white pizza; I believe that only the margherita and marinara pizzas off of the menu have red sauce. Anyway, the pistachios on the pizza rosa were an EXCELLENT touch.   Heritage Square is wonderful, especially at night. The layout and buildings are reminiscent of old New England architecture, which is a like a breath of fresh air in adobe-packed Arizona (which I love!). It's definitely a good place to stroll around (which you'll most likely have to do while you're waiting for your pizza :) ).   My advice: expect to wait. They don't take reservations. Even if it doesn't look busy, put your name in. And also, don't expect it to be the best pizza in the world. It's up there, and certainly delicious, but not the best.",

If you live in AZ you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  Steel yourself for a long wait, however, 3 hours isnt much if you've got friends and wine with you,  just dont get too drunk to taste your meal when its finally time to eat.",

Pizzeria Bianco blew away my expectations and is hands down the best pizza out West in my opinion.  The flavor of these pies are pretty incredible and the service is excellent.  Make the drive if you're in PHX and even wait in line if you have to, it's absolutely worth it!    FYI, maybe I got lucky but I went for lunch on a Wed and there was no wait.",

    "text": "The Pizzeria Bianco Date Night:  If you're gonna show up at Pizzeria Bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway...might as well make a nice day out of it. Bring the following things:  -Reusable cloth grocery bag -Large blanket/beach towels -Playing cards and/or board games -Disposable ice chest (if you don't want to buy beer/beverages from Bar Bianco) -Sunscreen -Frisbee (optional)  There are ample patches and hills of nice soft green grass in and around heritage square...absolutely perfect spots for a makeshift picnic. Pack everything in the cloth bag and show up to PB around 4:30 or so. You'll have to stand in line for a few minutes to put your name in...but once you do...it's Picnic time!   Find a nice shaded grassy hill...there's a quite ideal one over towards the Science Center. Lay out your towels and make a fun evening of it. You can relax with some beverages while playing cards with your significant other and as a nice side effect the people watching can be pretty great while you do so. By doing this, you're really killing two birds with one stone...you're getting to have a nice picnic...and as a side effect...you're negating the whole negative aspect of going to Pizzeria Bianco...the wait. Once your name gets called you simply toss everything back in the bag, throw the disposable cooler out...and voila...you're ready to have some great pizza in a cozy rustic pizza joint after your picnic.   I really don't see why you'd want to do anything else...it's making the best of a less than ideal situation. Each time I go there I see people lethargically pacing around with a beer, bored out of their gourd...I just don't get it...might as well try and have some fun.   Now on to Pizzeria Bianco itself...I didn't feel the need to really add too much content about the place itself, because what's already been said by the 300+ reviews is more than sufficient. I will say this...the pizza is great, but it's not all that different than pizza you can get at Cibo for example, where the wait is almost non-existent. What Pizzeria Bianco is, however...is a dining experience every Phoenix foodie must check off their bucket list at least one time.   4/5.",

Pizzeria Bianco is located in a quaint historic area of downtown Phoenix surrounded by several other turn of the century homes that have since been turned into little restaurants and bars. We went here after hearing some good reviews for lunch this past Saturday. We got here around 3ish so we were able to get a table right away on their front patio in the shade, but things fill up pretty quickly and I've heard its fairly typical to wait an hour for a table. We split a salad and had the margarita pizza with added fennel sausage. Everything is very simple but is done with very high quality ingredients that gives the food a very unique and delicious flavor! We will for sure be back!",

    "text": "Of course , I've heard the hype and was skeptical. If one more AZ native tells me where the \"best pizza in Phoenix\" is and mentions a chain!! I take my  pizza seriously, I'm an east coaster with a brick oven fetish. I've been to Pane Bianco for lunch and loved the sandwiches , so I should love the pizza. Right? I was concerned about the wait since I have no patience and waiting hours for a pie is Craazzzy! So I leave work early on a Wednesday and grab the hubby and headed downtown. The valet was close & easy. I walked into the restaurant and score 2 open chairs at the bar! We sat immediately and ordered drinks. My husband got a microbrew ( ok 2 ... )and me the DD a coke. We ordered the wise guy , which everyone was ordering , just check out the reviews and the Bianconverde. The latter doesn't come w tomato sauce , so we asked for extra tomato sauce with the ricotta , mozzarella , Parmesan & arugula pie. I  recommend trying this combo! it was amazing!! I can't eat a pizza without ricotta cheese now! The brick oven is in the middle of this tiny family style restaurant , so you can watch them make your pie. I loved the atmosphere and talking to others at the bar. No Scottsdale pretentiousness here. I left full( we did eat 2 pizzas) and missing home. This place is the equivalent of Stella's Pizzeria at 3rd & Lombard in Philly. Honestly, I never thought I'd find a good pizza let alone a fab brick oven pie in Phoenix , yes Phoenix! I guess the gods have been with me , since I've never waited for a table.",

    "text": "Wait, Three stars for Pizzeria Bianco? Impossible! This is the Holy Grail of South Western Pizza!!! The most sought after seat in Phoenix! Lines and wait times often referred to as absolutely worth  every second for a bite of pure perfection!!   Yes 3 stars!   This was my third visit to Phoenix.  Each visit we swore we would brave the elements and visit Pizzeria Bianco. Why? Well partly the mystique. I built my expectations on my personal experience of tasting his crusty delights at \"Alex Loves Lemonade\", and at the \"20th Anniversary Dinner at Luques\". I braved the 30 minute line at \"Alex Loves Lemonade\", biting into a slice with the perfect crunch and chew. I knew that Nancy Silverton of Pizzeria Mozza had chosen wisely, the pizza crust to emulate.   But this isn't a review of Chris Bianco's Traveling Pizza; if it was, you would see 5 stars. This is a review of Chris Bianco's first Pizzeria in Phoenix Arizona. Simply put my wife and I were disappointed.   The Appetizer: Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata. Stellar!!! Included eggplant parmigiana, corn, incredible carrots and parsnips. This started us off and it was incredible! Because of a disease, I'm not even supposed to be eating this much in the way of vegetables, but it was irresistible and Delicious!!   The Pizza: kind of boring, the crust perfect of course. With fennel sausage, smoked mozzarella and beautifully roasted onions. It just didn't taste like much. We ordered the \"Wise Guy\", where we really should have ordered the \"Sonny Boy\" - with Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives and added onions. Looking art puns, this was the star of the show, and I wish our server had pushed us in that direction. She had no problem guiding us to order the appetizer and wine.   Lastly, the Bathroom! Disgusting!! Not what you expect when you go to a restaurant of this caliber! This is Bianco's first restaurant and he should really represent and shine here. The garbage overflowing onto the floor, walls cracked with wet black mold, and the bottom of the toilet leaking water. This was the men's room. If this were the lady's room, the restaurant would be \"bye bye!\" With the empire of restaurants built in and around Phoenix, and his traveling pizza show, Pizzeria Bianco really blew it!!! We travelled throughout New Mexico and Arizona, making pit stops all along the way, truck stops and the Golden Arches were much more on top of their game when it came to cleanliness!!!",

Be aware that the space is pretty small so you might expect to wait on a busy night - they do have a bar next door to hang at.   We started with a caprese salad that was definitely splittable. The mozzarella was creamy and delicious but the tomatoes were cut so think that it was hard to eat (like 1/2\").   We also split a pizza - they're about 12\" and have a nice thin, crunchy crust. If you were hungry, a single person could take one of these down. Everything came up quickly and we had good service overall.     Bonus for listing some great AZ wines (Dos Cabezas!)",

Parking: valet. They charge $5.  People: fun for all ages.  Perks: a great date spot or if you want thin crust pizza.",

We ordered an antipasto platter that was quite disappointing because the roasted vegetables were quite oily and the small quantity of cheese + charcuterie was mediocre. We then tried one Biancoverde and one Wiseguy pizza. Both had a great combination of toppings that worked well together, but the crust was slightly too charred. They definitely make a solid pizza, but I feel are a bit pricey relative to other pizzerias and were not as memorable as I expected.  Location is nice and they do validate parking for the heritage square garage!",

It wasn't anything I couldn't get in any other city or location.

I really wanted to not like pizzeria Bianco due to its popularity BUT they honestly have the best Pizza in all of Phoenix. It would make sense; Pizzaolo Bianco made artisanal pizza popular in PHX.    I heard that when you visit a pizzeria, the best Pizza to indicate if the joint is worth visiting again or not is the classic margarita pizza. Their Margarita has a light and naturally sweet tomato sauce that elevates your taste buds to the heavens. I think I could eat their pizza with just tomato sauce without any cheese any day of the week.  My new favorite pizza is the Rosa. If you are a fan of Parmesan as well as pistachio, you'll love the intensity of these flavors on a pizza. The crust on this pizza was really something special and differentiates Pizzeria Bianco from the competition. It was crispy on the outside while still chewy on the inside (no oil used) while still full of delectable flavor.   This place is not just for hype. If you have any appreciation for simple and quality ingredients go to pizzeria Bianco!",

    "text": "This place is overhyped. I went here in 2012 and it was a novel idea to have pistachios on pizzas back then and I was but a college kid who didn't know any better.   Last night I got the Rosa and the Biancoverde. Both pizzas depended highly on the flavoring of the parmagiano reggiano.   The Biancoverde is a great concept with variety in texture but pretty bland and tasteless.  Adding more ricotta cheese and an ingredient that has some taste would do wonders.   The Rosa is basically eating Parmesan cheese on a piece of bread. They add red onions and some type of citric juice to relieve the tastebuds of realizing that you're eating too much cheese for too long. The pistachios are there for texture and to distract you from the fact that you're eating cheese on a piece of bread.   If these pizzas were $10 range, fine. But they charge a whopping $16-$19 per small/medium-sized pie.  Coming from Italy where I ate like a queen for no more than 10 per pie or meal, this is subpar and not worth the bucks.",

    "text": "Sorry, Bianco's. I really want to love this place, but just can't seem to find it in my heart. I would fight someone for a caprese sandwich at the sister sandwich shop Pane Bianco, but the pizza place didn't impress my when I tried it years ago and hasn't changed my mind in recent times. I brought my family here while on a pizza tour about a year ago and it didn't win any popular votes. With the recent launch of their cocktail program at Bar Bianco next door, decided to give it another try.  I met the soccer girls at the Bar. The place is tiny- cute and cozy- but so much so that everyone in the place can hear your conversation. Luckily, it was a cool crowd. The bartender was super nice and went above and beyond when he chased me down to return a bottle I forgot at the bar. My round one negroni was good (bonus point for the creative sub of punt e mes for vermouth), but my round two martinez tasted watery. The girls agreed with the cocktail assessment, good but not great. Too bad because the veggies and cheese on the antipasto plate were very good, as were the olives and sliced bread with oil for dipping.   When a table opened up at the restaurant next door, they called the bartender to let us know (nice!). Unfortunately, you cannot order pizza and eat it in the bar, but they do let you bring your cocktail from the bar into the restaurant. Once in the restaurant, it's beer and wine only. We split the mixed green salad, market salad (same as the mixed greens but with apples and goat cheese), and a margherita pizza. The greens were fresh, but the dressing just tasted like oil. The real claim to fame here is the pizza and I have to say, it's not my fave in town. Tough to justify coming back for a $15 pie when I can get one half the price at Parlor during HH, or for the same price at LGO one loaded with toppings.   It's also not a place that let's you linger and have a conversation with friends when you are done eating. They really turn the tables quick at this place- food comes out fast, check comes out fast, they were ready to pick up the bill and run before we had a chance to put our credit cards on the table. I guess it's fine since it was freezing inside and I was ready to get out and warm up. The place was packed on a Tuesday with a wait to get in. Good for them, I wish them lots of continued success. As for me, I'll stick to Bianco's other restaurants and be thankful to have so many other good pizza options in Phoenix these days.",

I think it might have something to do with the sauce (or maybe not.. because I do like lasagna and spaghetti).  But I decided to give this place a chance and sucked it up and ordered a pizza.  My waitress was super friendly.  When I asked her about two different pizzas and which one was better, she said they were both great and suggested that I order 1/2 and 1/2 if I couldn't decide.  I ended up getting the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy.  I sat at the bar, so it was nice seeing the chefs make my pizza, put it into the oven, and take it out. All of the ingredients they used were FRESH.  Both pizzas were really good - much better than any pizza I've ever had, but nothing toooooo special. The crust was DELICIOUS though! Each of the pizza slices were HUGE and hefty.  I liked Sonny Boy much more than I liked Wise Guy -- too many onions!  I'd definitely come here again. I'd love to try all of their other dishes, especially their small plates.  One thing to note: this place is popular and it's relatively small.  If you plan on bringing a large party here, I'd plan to wait for quite a bit (or just show up before they even open!).",

The pizza is descent, but is very small and extremely expensive for what you get.  When I saw the price, I thought it would be enough for 2 people to share, but it's not. Just small, expensive pizza that is a little bit above average taste.The restaurant is also tiny so you might have to wait to be seated and there is not a very wide selection of pizza to choose from, especially considering that this is a pizza restaurant.  You also have to pay for parking. Why don't they provide parking for their customers?  I did enjoy the pizza, but I left hungry.",

I was skeptical that it would really be the best pizza ever, and while I still feel like it is a lofty statement, it just might be True. Still, I'm not sure it's worth a 2 wait.

I saw several people with bread and oil but we weren't offered any. We didn't know if it was complimentary so we didn't say anything.

Maybe because I've know them basically my entire life. Lol my dad usually gets the wiseguy, my mom gets the bianco verde with prosciutto and my brothers and I would all get the marguerite with soppressata!! I do recommend their farmers salads, they use the freshest in season ingredients when making these! The homemade brick oven bread is simply to die for with or without some olive oil and pepper and with the pizza. I definitely will be keeping this a family tradition when I have a family of my own. Thanks Dave, Chris, Roberto & \"Nacho\" for always being so amazing to my family for the past 19 years!

A bar is right next door with outdoor seating, so the wait isn't bad.  The service inside is outstanding. We were given constant attention (without being overbearing). I recommend getting the half and half, which you can do with any of the pizzas. My girlfriend and I were able to try four different pizzas (margherita, wise guy, rosa, biancoverde).

    "text": "I'm not sure why Pizzeria Bianco gets such high ratings.  I left hungry and thinking, really...?  This is the best Phoenix has to offer?  The pizza is not worth the wait, and wait and wait some more.  By the time I ate not only was I not satisfied, so much time had passed I was ready for another meal.  One reviewer wrote that their pizza is served \"simply\".  Yes, that pretty much sums it up and explains why I leave hungry.  Maybe Pizzeria Bianco has a cult following and people like to say they went there because they think it sounds current and cultural.",

The second I got was the sauces and cheese and a little basil Outstanding this truly is a great pizza  it's pretty close but I love the crust here  the sauce a little better at serious pie So I guess its a tie ! I guess il have to try both again to determine a winner Stay Tuned !",

Mr. Bianco has created pizzas exactly like Napoli, Italy!   After managing resorts in Bari, Ortranto & Sicily My wife and I found that the pizzas, salads and breads reminded us of Italy. So nice to see fresh products used on the pies!   I know some say the wait is long but dinner is supposed to be like that! Also want to say that the staff was very nice and the pizza chefs have been well trained.   Bravo!",

I know most consider it the best in the country or the best in the world, and maybe it so for some reason, which is great but it only means that some people don't travel outside of Phoenix as often as they should.  Once again, the food was a solid good food so there is no issue there.  My only issue is the claim that it is the \"best\" - that I don't get. OK OK if I have to be super picky, I can also add that the cheese was on the stingy side = large patches of exposed tomato sauce were evident throughout the pie.  and the parking, hmm the parking - sucks.  Small parking lot, Valet only (which I don't like at all) + $3.00 for the \"pleasure\" - really? really?",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm giving Pizzeria Bianco 3 stars...   Warning - Long Phoenix foodie history lesson starting.... NOW!  Here's the deal. Picture this: 2008, the Bush era was almost over, music got ridiculously good, fashion dictated perfection not seen since the 1950's, I had a beautiful boyfriend (crazy, and alcoholic as f***, but beautiful nonetheless), and the Foodie revolution in Phoenix was just about to take off.   Pizzeria Bianco had already been there serving the best food made by human hands. This wasn't a result of a competitive restaurant environment, it was a creation resulting from the passion inside Chris Bianco.   I would bring my beau to heritage square and put our names on the waiting list at 5 pm.    We would wait in the blistering heat. We'd go to a movie, then we'd sneak into the trees to make out a bit. We'd play scrabble outside and meet other people waiting.   At 8:45, if we were lucky, we got a table for two. Sometimes we waited until 10.   The food.. (queue Italian reminiscent theme music)...  The memory of the soppressata appetizer is my fondest pre-vegan food memory. Meat is a disgrace, but if I was an animal I'd way rather end up as that soppressata than a McDonalds burger.   The pizza.. I would always order two at the restaurant, then two to take home. I tried all six over several visits, but the Pizza Margherita was always the best. It had a perfection matched by no other pizza I had ever tasted - not from Rome, not from Sicily, not from New York, or Boston, or Chicago.  A perfectly soft yet crisp flat dough, slightly charred by the charcoal in the (coal?) oven, covered by tomato sauce that was at once fresh, yet matured with basil and salt.  house made mozzerella topped it, and it was perfection. Each Pizza was crafted by Chris Bianco himself. He would take a second to smile and nod at you between each Pizza. Every pizza was made by his hand. That was the magic.  Once, I caught Chris Bianco's eye from across the restaurant as I was leaving. I spoke to him in non verbal Italian, simply with my hands and my expression. \"Thank you deeply for the miracle you have created here. I am well nourished by it, what magnificent food!\"   He responded back with a clasp of his chest, as if saying \"I am so grateful you can appreciate and share this!\" Then blew me a kiss. It was a masculine non-gay loving Italian heartfelt goodbye.   So why 3 stars? That was 2008..   In 2010, Chris Bianco had to stop making the pizzas for his health:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azcentral.com%2Fthingstodo%2Fdining%2Farticles%2F20100127chris-bianco-no-more-pizzas.html&s=b43a4c6040c9bf1458bd053fdb2b5baf37c88f77cf991e7b62d20bf9c417e99d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azcentral.com/thingstodo...</a>  He turned the cooking duties over to his assistant, but now, 3 years later, the magic has been lost. There was very little special about the Margherita Pizza I had in January when I went. It was a ghost of what it used to be. Almost unrecognizable.   It's still good pizza, but dear readers, I am so sorry to say, it is not worth more than a 15 minute wait.   Chris Bianco earned every accolade he got. I do not fault him. I know he would still be making every pie if he could. The tragedy is there is only 1 Chris Bianco.",

    "text": "Ok, whoever said this was one of the best places to eat pizza obviously spent too much time in the desert sun, had no palette, or never ate pizza in their life. (or a combination of these) This was by far one of the worst places I have ever eaten pizza in my entire life.  21.00 for a pizza that the crust was so paper thin and burnt.    This place is by no means kid friendly.  No butter for their bread and no pepperoni.  Who the hell ever heard of that?  No pepperoni?  I speculate since the crust was so thin, the grease from the pepperoni would destroy the paper thin crust.  Just with the salami, stingy amount of cheese and the wood fired mushroom, they all fell off the pizza.  seriously, you would need a spoon to eat it if it was a real pizza with real amount of toppings.  And it was so thin you just may have needed a spoon to eat it an.  I was just telling my spouse how this was the most unfriendly kid place when in walked a husband and wife with 4 kids.  Wouldn't you know 2 of them were so excited about having pepperoni pizza.    Had it not been for the fact we had them put garlic on the pizza it would have no flavoring.  I did mention it before but let me tell you again, they were very stingy with the cheese.  For a place who boasts about making their own mozzarella you would think they would but a sufficient amount of cheese on their pizza.  It is alot cheaper to make fresh mozzarella so there is no reason for not putting enough on their pizza except for the fact their crust could not hold it.  This is by far one of the worst pizzas I have had in a very long time.  On the good side, the service was excellent.  Be overall I would say, BUYER BEWARE!  I have had some slumdog carry out/delivery  pizza which tasted better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh Yeah, did I mention, it was burnt like the desert floor too?????",

Not for 3hours, that just pushes you over the top with patience and so much more.  Good thing for them I was with a close friend so it was definitely a fun wait time to catch up in, but we were hungry soooo hungry.  Walked around all over.... CHASE Stadium picked up hot dogs off food vendor, overlooked at monster rally going on, walked around museum areas and etc..  The wait is so insane they have another house by them just for people to wait at, drink & snack there =/  Its really like a house inside, kinda weird but koo at the same time.  Dim lights in there.  Pizzeria Bianco already has a couple patio wood tables outside around it for people to chill at too.  Its just a waiting frenzy!  Pizza: Oven brick baked.  Seriously was good though.  Good enough for 1hour wait for 2 people, maybe 1 1/2 - 2hour wait for table of 4.  Thin Pizza, fresh & oOOo so yummy.  Better than my Under the Brooklyn Bridge Pizza, almost.... but hey freaking good for a place like Arizona right? Salad - not really worth it.  Drinks are mostly bottled, so dont get it if you're super thirsty.  Take Out: No take out unless you're seated.  If seated, you need to order it the same time you put in your order.  Service:  You'll be surprised.  If you sit at the bar, its wonderful service.  The time wait apology, drink order, food order chat, appitz comes, food comes & a nice check on how we like it etc....  Groups: Better to come by yourself, two people or 4 at max.  If you come with 3, lets just hope it doesn't take an hour longer because of the 3rd person haha  Parking: Difficult to find.  Tip: It opens around 5:30pm I think.  Come no later than 4pm!  And you might find parking.",

    "text": "First Timer!!!!!  I had heard about this place from so many different people that I felt compelled to try it. It is situated nicely off to the side of the Science Center courtyard. Upon entering, you no longer feel like you are in Arizona. You have an overwhelming sense of walking into the neighborhood, Italian family owned pie shop. The building itself is quite small and does not seat very many people, but it gives you the cozy, comfortably crowded feel that so many New York pie shops deliver.  Now if you are lucky enough to get in right away then my hats off to you. More than not, you will have a wait time of 30 minutes or more. Lucky for the wine drinkers of this city, directly next door is Bianco's wine bar. It's a casually romantic set up in there. The wine list is more varied than I thought it would be (happily surprised) and the value is not bad either. The prices are not pretentiously overpriced which is refreshing in this town. I recommend the Scarpetta Barbera... those who know this wine, you know why... those who don't, you'll know why after you drink the bottle :)  Now, back to the food... pizza! The menu does have more than just pizza but honestly, why would you go to a pizza parlor for a salad? The varieties of pizza on Bianco's menu are quite impressive. There seems to be one for everybody: the meat lover, the vegetarian, the health nut or the pizza connoisseur. We ordered the Margarita pizza and the Proscuitto & Arugula pizza. And let me tell you... wow! The flavors were so great and the ingredients so fresh! I cannot believe between the two of us we went through all the pizza... we just could not help it I guess :)  The only reason I cannot give this place the full 5 stars was due to the wait staff. Unfortunately, she seemed to be insincere, inattentive and very caddy. Oh well, you cannot have it all I guess. But that one piece to this complex and delicious machine will not keep me from coming back... see you soon!",

    "text": "We went here after years (literally) of hearing how amazing this pizza is and how highly rated it was on a national level. The place was so adorable and tucked away in the parking lot with cafe lights strung across the patio. Such a warm and welcoming restaurant. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly servers and chefs. The inside is tiny (10 tables or so) but we were seated right away.   We ordered a pizza and got half salami, half margherita. It took about 10-15 minutes but of course that's because it was being freshly baked in the giant wood-fired brick oven.  The pizza was really GOOD, it is exactly how I imagine it would be in Italy.  Super thin crust, slightly burned edges, sparse on the tomato sauce, and fresh ooey cheese and toppings. So yummy. Now I know this is a personal opinion, but there is another restaurant in the valley (it is a chain. i know....bad) that we both think is better. And cheaper.   But if you want authentic pizza and a romantic, cozy dining experience, I highly recommend trying Pizzeria Bianco!",

Also the establishment is quite charming.",

    "text": "So much has been written about Pizzeria Bianco that we had to give it a try, regardless of wait time. Fortunately, we decided to go there during an off hour, around 3:30 pm on a Saturday. The wait we were told was still an hour. We killed time next door at Bar Bianco but then I wondered why wouldn't they use this space to serve more patrons? Anyways, the wait ended up to be a quick 30 minutes.   The Wiseguy was what was recommended so I had that (fennel sausage, mozzarella, and onions) and added mushrooms to it. We also ordered the Margherita for the table. Overall, the menu is pretty short and simple. Pizzas came out pretty quickly. The combination of flavors on the Wiseguy was good, but it seemed a bit too oily. The Margherita was a bit more traditional and was good.   Staff was friendly and the ambiance was nice. I liked the waiting area Bar Bianco next door. It was like you were sitting in someone's home. The restaurant itself is small. If you have a large group, good luck.  So was all this worth the wait? Ummm, not sure 'bout that.",

Think of going to Pizzeria Bianco as an \"experience\" not just  \"getting dinner\".  Expect long waits on most days if you don't want to get there early enough to be seated immediately. There's a wine bar next door where you will find yummy cheese platters and vino. Which means you can sip and snack while you wait in line. Give yourself about 3 hours for the entire experience and after making a reservation check out the pub just across the way, (if you have to wait a while). They have great beer, my favorite onion rings, a pool table, and indoor-outdoor seating (just be sure to keep checking back to make sure you don't get passed up!)   Although each magnificent, My favorite Pizza's are:   \"Sonny Boy\"(Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives)    \"Rosa\":   (Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios) I'm a regular here and the service and quality is always the same: MAESTRO WORK... Eat well, live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers",

    "text": "Despite the lines, the crowds, and the wait, I found Pizzeria Bianco to be a worthwhile dining experience....even though it didn't fit into my Chicago-style definition of pizza.\r \r This isn't the place to loosen up, stuff yourself silly , and quaff beer by the pitcher.  If you're on a date or entertaining an out-of-town couple, it's pretty hard to beat.  But if you're looking to feed a softball team or a sizable collection of drinking buddies, don't even think about it.\r \r Getting seated at Bianco reminds me of doing the same at Zachary's ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/JsqK99Ka8gIgu1ZtzDupRg\">yelp.com/biz/JsqK99Ka8gI...</a> ) in Oakland, Ca.  You walk in, a receptionist takes your name, and they give you a projected wait time that can be as long as an hour.  Right around this time I'm thinking it'd be nice if we could wait in a bar, chat over a beer, and somehow be summoned back  when our table was ready. To my utter delight, our waitress informed us that LO AND BEHOLD!!! SUCH A SETUP EXISTED!!!  We were quickly shooshed over to a rather pleasant bar next door where the lengthy wait passed by painlessly as we sipped drinks and chatted up the locals.  The bar was crowded too....and I had my doubts about the restaurant staff's claim of a Saint Bernard-like ability to find us in the crush of humanity....but find us they did, and minutes later we were seated and perusing the bill of fare.\r \r First off, a glimpse at the menu told me I was in for something completely out of the ordinary.  Pizza's only came in thin crust, and were served in only one size.  There was no build-your-own list of toppings, and the pre-defined combinations didn't look anything like standard pizza parlor fair.  On the other hand, the sizable wood-fired pizza oven in the corner looked fascinating, and Bianco himself was running the kitchen with a focus and dedication that bordered on religious fanaticism.\r \r Tires hit pavement when the pizzas showed up.  I've gotta say it was dang tasty, and I didn't regret the wait or the expense one bit.  Still, if you're craving a more Chicago-style pizza, this just doesn't cut it.  The ingredients are fantastic, the preparation is perfect, and the ambiance isn't lacking in the slightest......but halfway through my first pie I found myself yearning for something thicker, and wound up fighting the urge to grab two pieces at once or fold one over to simulate a thicker slice.  If, like myself, you hail from San Francisco, it's similar to Pauline's Pizza ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/tIzKxpADKMMmzDr5n07lQg\">yelp.com/biz/tIzKxpADKMM...</a> ) on Valencia between 14th and Duboce.\r \r All in all, Pizzeria Bianco was great, but nothing to set the world on fire.  It was tasty, and it was without doubt a high-quality pizza.  East Coasters with their love for a thinner, more spartan pie will probably see it's virtues....But as for myself, I see it in the same way I do Pauline's Pizza in San Francisco...memorable and worth the visit, but it  never comes to mind when the pizza craving rears it's ugly head...",

The owner of PB is a genius, he has set up a bar next door so you can get buzzed while you wait, wait and did I mention wait to eat a pizza next door.   Anyways, by the time we were seated I was buzzed and the desert heat had gotten to me. We ordered a bunch of pizzas and from what I recall they were good.

After many years of not wanting to wait in the legendary 3 hour line for Bianco I decided to try it brave it and take an out of town friend to this famous pizzeria. It was a Wednesday night, about 6:30pm. We walked in and got a table immediately. Has the hype died down or did we just get lucky? Anyway, apparently Wednesday is a good night to go.  We ordered the market salad which was arugula with apples, goat cheese and a wine vinaigrette and a margherita pizza to share. The salad was delicious. Fresh ingredients, not too much dressing and the perfect amount for two to share. Following that came the pizza. It was good but honestly not that great. I was expecting to be wowed. I wanted to bite in and say \"holy crap is this good.\" Instead I bit in and thought \"yeah, it's pretty good.\" My out of town friend who had never even heard of the place (or the hype) agreed. Maybe if you wait for three hours it does taste amazing because by that time you're starving and any pizza would taste like the best pizza ever. I was just glad we didn't wait that long for pizza that was just good.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it. Overall I'd say the food was good but not worth all the hype. The salad was more memorable than the pizza. For a similar style pizza I'd recommend La Grande Orange instead.",

On a good note, Pizzeria Bianco serves extremely fresh ingredients and the bar next door is perfect for a pint.

Oh, to avoid a 3 to 4 hour wait to get in, it was advised to arrive during off hours. I was glad that we did! After all is said and done, if we had waited more than a few minutes to get in, we would have killed someone who HYPED this place up!   The menu was VERY limited and heaven forbid if you wanted an Antipasto-that was available ONLY after 5 PM. Oh, is it the oven that the pizza is baked in that causes the HYPE? You got to be kidding me! Some reviews have stated. \"It's the best pizza in the world\"-I guess those persons haven't traveled much. While it's not the best, the cost/price is one of the highest. Do NOT ask for Diet Coke as they think Mexican Light Coke is the same! It's not, so avoid ordering a diet coke as they don't have the real thing!   We compared Pizzeria Bianco to Grimaldi's +( NYPD-standard pizza oven) in AZ and John's in NYC and found those are better in every way. AND the cost is lower. Yes, John's in NYC has some hype but they can back that up with great pizza and a FULL menu. Grimaldi's is expanding their AZ locations and is better IF you like coal brick-oven pizza. If you want to get caught up in the HYPE, this is the place for you! Just arrive at lunch or dinner time and you can join the HYPE Crowd. Would we ever consider returning to Pizzeria Bianco? NO!",

    "text": "I can now say I have reached the pinnacle of pizza perfection.  Pizza has always been one of my favorite foods and has recently become one of my obsessions after visiting Naples this summer. I have found some amazing people within the states most notably in the Bay Area, Southern California and Chicago, but was simply blown away by the perfection that is Pizzeria Bianco.  I came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait for a table of five. We sat down and were super excited to sample some of the best pizza in America.  I started off with a salad consisting of fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and tomatoes. It is probably impossible to make that list of ingredients taste bad and this salad did not disappoint. Everything worked perfectly together. The salad was light, so fresh and so damn good.  I had to order the margherita pizza because that's the best way to judge a place I feel. The pizza came out piping hot and it was absolutely beautiful. The crust was for sure a clear highlight. It had a beautiful char and a great chew to it. The combination of sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil made this easily one of the best pizzas I have ever had. So amazing.  I also tried a few slices of the Rosa pizza and that thing blew me away. The combination of onions, paremesan reggiano and arizona pistachios was a flavor I had never experienced. The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful. It was one of the best specialty pizzas I have ever had.  I came into Pizzeria Bianco with insanely high expectations and I believe the restaurant exceeded them. The ingredients are what really set this place apart from everyone else and the pizza is simply amazing. Bianco sets the standard for Neapolitan pizza in the United States and I am not sure there is another place that could beat it....",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco is in downtown Phoenix, a five hour, nonstop flight from New York City. A simple Italian eatery set amidst south western mesas that outline the horizon, cacti, and bone-dry 100 degree weather.  One would not be quick to assume that this is the place where some of the finest pizza in the continental U.S. is made. An almost hour-long wait and the anticipation seemed to recreate a familiar occurrence. If there was something New Yorkers did well, it was they knew how to wait. The scenario is a familiar one. We wait for trains, the post office, our coffee, and the list can go on and on. Thus, waiting for a table at a prized eating location was no encumbrance at all. Especially if you did not have reservations on hand.  My dining partners in crime were peers I had just met at the AIGA Pivot Design Conference. Their anticipation for a memorable meal was just as apparent as mine and our other fellow pending diners, mostly other conference attendees. To disregard the need to wax lyrical about this experience would be inappropriate. While the restaurant boasts house made country bread, luxuriously delicate olive oil, makes their own mozzarella and has an herb garden in their backyard--I would like to address the pizza.  Every disc that emerges from Bianco's prized brick oven is a delicious discourse amongst ingredients that know a thing or two about savoir faire. They do not argue brashly. Rather, they express a point of view that does not over extend its stay and courteously assent to the other players in the game. This decorum is best exemplified in the Rosa, an intimate gathering of Arizona pistachios, red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano and rosemary. This is umami in its finest moment, oozing with salty pungency that is brilliantly composed. The crust was a juggle of thinness and chewiness that maintained a hearth char but a yielding surface for the ingredients to shine.  Bravo Phoenix!",

    "text": "As an avid pizza maker myself, I looked forward to visiting Pizzeria Bianco for the first time.       I was fortunate enough to be in town on a Monday for lunch, so I did not experience the legendary long wait times.  I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately.  I ordered the Sonny Boy pizza, which is analogous to an upscale pepperoni pizza.  It had tomato sauce, their house made mozzarella, sopressata (spicy Italian salami) and some fancy olives.    Getting the crust right is the first order of business for a great pizza place and Bianco does not disappoint.  It was baked to perfection.  The crust was stretched thin.  The rim (cornicone) was puffed up just the right amount and the underside had the perfect amount of charring; not burned, just baked correctly.  There was no \"gum line\" to be found anywhere in the crust and the end of the pizza droops just the right amount.  The crust wasn't a cardboard biscuit, nor was it floppy/soupy.  It had the right amount of structure and chew.    You really know that you've eaten a great pizza when it begins to taste even better as you approach the end of the pizza.  As much as I'm gushing over the crust, I will say that I've come to prefer the flavor of naturally leavened dough (sourdough) for pizza.  I think that the crust could be even better if he made the move to natural leavening, but that's just my preference.  The sopressata was spicy, but not overly so, not was it too salty.  The sauce was simple and tasty and I'm in love with their cheese.  Looking at the food on the tables of other patrons it's apparent that their produce is among the most beautiful I've ever laid eyes on.  I've never seen tomatoes that red or arugula that green, etc.    Is this the best pizzeria in the country?  It is uncommonly excellent, but I have had pizzas elsewhere that were every bit as good.",

We also go to the new one on camelback that serves pasta and sandwich dishes (both absolutely amazing, and made fresh in house.) We really like that they make their breads and noodles from scratch. The ingredients used are locally grown, which is awesome. They also feature Arizona ingredients and beverages on each menu.    My favorite pizza is the bianco verde with prosciutto, and my husband gets the margherita pizza with sopressata, or even just plain! These are our go to's, but the wiseguy and rosa are amazing too! I adore the speidini... procuitto wrapped around fontina cheese on a bed of arugula, drizzled with olive oil! Mmmm, I want this all right now! Also, we typically get a bottle of wine, which seems to be the best way to go. They have a good selection of local and Italian wines at a reasonable price.   Make sure you go before your starving though, because you are likely to wait at the original location. We have waited anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Luckily, Bar Bianco is right next door, so you can hop in for a cocktail... or three, and an appetizer while you wait. Both spots are quaint with timeless charm, so perfect for a date night or place to bring visitors. The pizza never disappoints! We will continue to come at least once a month!",

The ingredients were fresh and the dough was to die for. Can't wait to go back and try more flavors.   Not only was the food really spectacular but the staff was awesome. We had been sitting and chatting, forgotten that we had ordered when our wait staff kindly told us they had lost our order and were comping our meal. We weren't upset and honestly we would've still paid for the meal but the fact that they owned a mistake and compensated for it was awesome. Grateful for establishments that put the customer first and are full of integrity.",

The sausage was not too salty and had nice spices for flavor. The caramelized onions was a nice balance of slight sweetness to the savory sausage. Cheese was delicious but we added red sauce to it.

I didnt like the fact that there was only valet parking, but whatever. The staff comes off like Notherners: straight to the point. I ordered half Rosa half Wise Guy. The pizza was a thin crust, but it wasnt a cracker crisp crust. The crust ends all had their own unique characteristics. One piece was doughy, one was firm and chewy, and one was crispy firm. Although some people would be put off by it, I was actually intrigued. Dont worry though, the inner dough was consistent. These are definitely Neapolitan pizzas. These wont be overloaded with toppings at all. What surprised me how it wasn't greasy, yet had a good coating of grease throughout the pizza. The roasted pistachios and smoked sausage were grade ingredients that stand out the moment you eat them. This was also a good sized pizza that I could eat by myself and not feel bloated afterward. Overall, i was impressed.",

This really is one of the finest pizza places in the country for a Neopolitan-style pizza.  Full disclosure, I've already mentioned in another review that my wife and I are disciples of the Chris Bianco school of cooking (see review for Tratto):  simple food prepared well, letting natural flavors speak for themselves through excellent ingredients, local sourcing, etc.  My wife would kill, KILL a person, to get the bread service with olive oil.  I wouldn't go that far, it is good, but this is her favorite part of the meal.  We've tried everything on the menu.  4 stars for everything not a pizza.  The pizza bumps it up to 5.  The following, in my opinion, are the best pizzas from best to weakest: Margherita Rosa Sonny Boy Biancoverde Wiseguy Marinara  A pizza doesn't have to have meat to make it a superior pizza.  Balance between the crust and the toppings to the sauce (if there is one), along with flavor of the individual toppings themselves.  The interplay between cheese and crust, I'm salivating already.    His sauce is well-balanced, the cheese has nice drag and chew.  The blistered crust.    Yes, the wait could be long.  Just grab a drink next door and stop complaining.  You should be happier coming in buzzed and hungry rather than just hungry.  Reservations are taken for parties of 6 or more.",

My 2nd pizza I had the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy. Asked for extra garlic again but he forgot on my 2nd pizza! Well, the 2nd pizza was definitely a lot tastier than my 1st and I was kinda full eating it so that says a lot about the pizza. Parking sucks. Really, $5 for valet parking that's right next to the restaurant? That's day light robbery IMO. I just parked down the street and paid $1.50 for meter parking (1 1/2 hour).  Honestly, the location alone with the parking deters me enough that I wouldn't come back here unless invited and there are so many other pizza places in Phoenix.",

It was busy, but one of the perks at this location is the building they own next door allowing you to have a couple drinks while waiting for your table.  Our service was excellent, we shared a salad and margherita pizza and then a dessert that I can't remember.    I will say the place reeks of brownnosing clientele - no less than five times I heard people name-dropping trying to get a better table or chance at meeting the master, but alas he was not on site this particular night.    One big downside is the parking situation.  I don't like being forced to use valet, no matter what the event / locale is.  I can understand limited parking in that part of town, but this is something that the other restaurants deal with w/o making their patrons pay more.  The pizza, while really good, was not the best in town in my humble opinion (see downtown Pomo) - but that pie is so good I'm not sure I'll ever have better until I am actually somewhere in Italy.  I don't think there's a better pizza joint in that specific part of town, and it is close to the ball park and a few other venues, so it's likely that I'll go back some day - just not in a rush.",

I could eat here everyday if they weren't so busy! Please open up more stores!!!  I would not consider this the best pizza in the US. However, for Phoenix, it's probably the best pizza joint. Pomo Pizzeria is a very good second.",

We pulled up to the location which conveniently has a valet, not sure where you'd park otherwise since we were not from the area. Luckily there was no wait and we were able to get our drink and food order going quickly. We tried the Sonny Boy, Biancoverde & Wise Guy. All 3 pizzas were fantastic, no complaints. Even my mother, who doesn't like pizza much ate several slices including the crust...that says it all! Im so glad we listened to other yelpers, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "***Phoenix's Pizzeria Bianco has greatly influenced the many excellent Italian style pizzerias across the country like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza; I felt the pizzas at Pizzeria Bianco were good though less satisfying than several of the outstanding restaurants it inspired***  Pizzeria Bianco is one of the country's most celebrated restaurants for pizza.  It won a James Beard award long before many of the Italian style pizzerias featuring high quality, fresh ingredients started popping up in major cities across the country.  This Pizzeria Bianco (there is another location in the Phoenix area) is in Downtown Phoenix and is located just a few blocks away from the city's major sports venues like Chase Field.  Pizzeria Bianco has a great exterior with its historical looking brick structure.  The inside dining room is fairly small, but it is vibrant and comfortable and showcases a wood burning oven behind the bar.  In addition to their signature pizzas, Pizzeria Bianco's menu features a small selection of starters and salads.  Pizzeria Bianco's antipasto plate offers a variety of wood roasted vegetables, sopressata and a hard Italian cheese.  I did not really care much for the vegetables.  I felt they were a tad soggy and the broccoli was oddly sweet.  Zucchini and peppers were some of the other vegetables on the plate.  I really liked the sopressata though.  It was not just a standard salty cured meat.  It had a good salty note, but it also had a bit of spiciness.  The sopressata was also perfectly thin and moist; it combined with the dry cheese and their baguette to make for a great bite.  Prosciutto wrapped figs were also on the antipasto plate.  I tried a variety of their pizzas.  My favorite would be their margherita.  All of the ingredients were good.  There was a good tomato sauce, nicely melted mozzarella (the right amount too) and fragrant basil.  I did feel those same ingredients shined more at Los Angeles Italian pizzerias like Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive.  I also felt the crust at Pizzeria Bianco was a tad bland.  The crust at Pizzeria Bianco though was uniformly thin and crispy.  I also had their margherita pizza and added prosciutto and arugula.  This was a good pizza though the prosciutto at Pizzera Mozza has a much more delicious flavor as well as a more satisfying thin and soft texture.  Their Wiseguy pizza with fennel sausage, roasted onion and smoked mozzarella was okay though I personally have never been a fan of pizzas without tomato sauce.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Prices are okay.  Given that Pizzeria Bianco is a pizzeria, you are obviously going to be able to dine here at a much lower cost than other highly celebrated Phoenix restaurants, which tend to be more upscale and feature fine dining prices.  Pizzeria Bianco is priced similarly to most Los Angeles Italian pizzerias though it offers more reasonable prices than Pizzeria Mozza.  Pizzeria Bianco is a good option for Italian style pizza though I have enjoyed other places more for Italian style pizza like Los Angeles' Pizzeria Mozza and Milo & Olive and Minneapolis' Pizzeria Lola; while Pizzeria Lola does not have the great crust of Pizzeria Bianco, I felt the toppings, sauce and cheese at Pizzeria Lola were all more delicious.  I also thought my recent trip to Los Angeles' order-at-the-counter Pitfire put out a more satisfying pizza.  Still, Pizzeria Bianco has a lot of history and it has inspired many pizzerias across the country including Pizzeria Mozza.  Given Pizzeria Bianco's similarities to many other Italian style pizzerias found in major metros like Los Angeles and San Francisco, it might not be the best choice if you are only in Phoenix for a night or two.  But if you can try some food that is more unique to Phoenix and still have a few lunch or dinner slots open, Pizzeria Bianco is worth a visit.  I am not sure what the parking situation is in Downtown Phoenix, but it looks like parking would be easier to find here than downtown areas in other bigger cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco.  Pizzeria Bianco also offers valet parking.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco was the 2nd stop on the Tim S. Lunch tour.   Actually the way I look at it, it was just a 3 course meal at 3 different locations.  We had our first course appetizer, the Soppressata sandwich at Pane Bianco that was 5 stars and drove straight from there to our Main course at Pizzeria Bianco.  This is James Beard Award winning chef Chris Bianco's original location.  I've heard about this spot before as one of the top pizza joints in the country.  I've been to many of the greatest pizzerias in the country, so Pizzeria Bianco had some pretty big shoes to fill.  Tim, said his favorite pie here is the Wiseguy pizza.  This had wood roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage.  Perhaps some olive oil drizzled on the crust, but other than that there was really no sauce here.  This was an excellent pizza and I highly recommend it.  Although I'm usually a purist and love a traditional red sauce on a pie, I didn't miss it here.  The wood roasted onions, were nice thick strips of onion, but pretty much caramelized.  Not to the point of mush though.  I'm not sure their technique for wood roasting them, but there is way more to them than that, meaning lots of butter or perhaps they are marinated first.  The star of the show was the fennel sausage.  I wouldn't get a pizza here without getting their sausage.  Sliced diagonally, each piece of sausage was a good size.  The smoked mozzarella, melted in a very creamy way, more like a burrata would.  At first I thought some ricotta was added, but no, it was just the creamy mozzarella.  The pizza crust was very thin, and perhaps a little too thin for the weight of these toppings.  It could have been charred a little more as well.  But I'm nitpicking at this point as it had a great flavor to it and this was a 5 star pie for sure.  The pizzas here are all individual size, so the 2nd one we split was the Sonny Boy.  This is a traditional red sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella, salami, and gaeta olives.  I found the gaeta olives to be way too powerful for this pizza and covered up the sweet tomato sauce flavor.  When I pushed them off, I was much happier.  I was also happier with the crust on this pie as it had a little more char to it and the crust, while just as thin, held up well and wasn't soggy.  What a difference an extra minute can make in a wood burning oven.  Since the salami was cooked, it was hard for me to determine what kind of \"salami\" it was.  It had a little spice like a soppressata, but I can't say for sure that it was.  4 stars  Is Pizzeria Bianco one of the top pizza places in the country?  I'm not so sure, it's very good though.  When I first had Lombardi's or Di Fara's in New York, I knew right away that those are two of the best pizzas I've ever tasted.  Since I'm left wondering....I'd say on the national scale of best of the best...4 stars is about right.  And it's definitely worth coming in for that Wiseguy pizza.  On to our 3rd lunch stop.....the dessert course at Sweet Republic....",

    "text": "I've been coming to pizzeria Bianca since 2001. I've always had a fantastic time. So for my birthday I decided it would be a fun spot to take my husband. First the pizza was as good as always... But this time the service was UNACCEPTABLE!   Kari was our server and she was terrible. It took awhile for her to come over to us initially. She bussed a table before even greeting us (in a not so busy restaurant at the time between lunch and dinner). This is a forgivable offense, but then she never checked on us, she never asked how we were, she never asked if we needed anything or if we liked the pizza until our pizzas were gone. She asked if we wanted another beer only after it had been empty for 10 mins and the meal was over. She never refilled the water, someone else was nice enough to do that for her!   And here's the worst part: when we ordered the anti-pasta dish we were told it wasn't available until 5pm, yet another table (which happened to be employees / friends of the manager) got the same dish 20 mins after we ordered it. So it wasn't that it wasn't available, it's that it wasn't available for the likes of us. When I asked about it, Kari said well sometimes it's available sooner than 5pm. Did she bother to ask if it was available for us? No! When I mentioned, \"oh, it looks like they work here\" (since the hostess sat down with them) She said, \"well yeah, they're friends of he manager.\" To which I respond: \"Favoritism is always appreciated.\" So thank you very much for the horrible experience! Did she offer anything else in exchange? No! I didn't even bother to tell her it was my birthday. I asked for a manager. \"Oh, I'm sorry there isn't one on duty!\" Needless to say, I won't be talking up Pizzeria Bianco anymore like I have for years. This was a horrible experience and I won't be back.",

The line on a Saturday night typically begins forming at 4pm for a 5pm opening.  There is a bar next door, Bar Bianco to help keep you entertained for that hour.  There's only 10 tables or more inside so the wait can be very long.  Don't think you can go to dinner and then do something after unless it's really late.  You can never predict the line.  Also, once you get seated, dinner takes a while.  But if you make this your \"event\" for the night, enjoy the wait with come cocktails and maybe an app from the bar, you will love the food and experience.  Also, I think they only take 2 reservations per night of either 6 people or 8 people so that could be your best bet!",

Once we got there we saw there were a few parking spots but there was an orange cone that one of the employees had to move.  We were seated on the patio because the inside is quite small & it was lunch time so they were a bit busy. The best part was that there was a cute dog at the table near us...  The pizza was overpriced & very thin. There were not very many options & what options there were did not sound overly appetizing. Take a look at their menu before you make the trek there & get disappointed too.",

The restaurant is in a nice little spot in heritage square.  The place is a bit small, but I was there on a sunday afternoon so really only a 5 minute wait for a spot at the bar.    So my rating is based on comparing to other pizza places in town that people have recommended, this one actually meets expectations.  Look forward to going again.",

Then a large salad with croutons made from garlic bread. Delightful. Three fresh entrees cooked to perfection. All different, all wonderful. A wonderful lunch. A must for you to try.",

Also parking is valet only for $5 - ever hear of a pizza joint charging for valet parking?",

The crust was perfect, the ingredients were fresher than fresh, and for as long as you wait for a table, the food comes out surprisingly fast!

    "text": "Great brick oven pizza!  If you are in the downtown Phoenix area near the Arizona Science Center or Chase Field and want one of the best brick oven pizza's, you have to come here.  Street parking is difficult, valet parking is expensive, garage parking is bearable if you don't mind a short walk and get a parking validation ticket at the restaurant.  The entire building is brick with a nice lawn area with a long picnic table lined with fig trees. There is another building which they use as wet bar and waiting area. Get there early or expect to wait because this place is popular.  This is my second time to Pizzeria Bianco and the quality and service has not disappointed. We came a little before lunch time to beat the crowd and got a nice table in front of the brick oven which takes up a quarter of the restaurant. We decided to order just one pizza to share since we wanted to save room for other taste treats.  We ordered the Wiseguy which is originally one of their white pizza's, but with a tomato sauce. It's topped with roasted onions, fennel sausage and smoked mozzarella. All the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection.   The menu is limited, but seasonal ingredients are often available. It's a bit pricey, but worth every penny. I'm not sure if I would recommend it if the wait is more than an hour in the middle of the summer.  Recommendations: Arrive at least 30 min. early, park in the garage, get a parking validation ticket, and try a pizza.",

    "text": "After reading about it's opening so many years ago, and then watching bit by bit as Bianco received accolades as some of the best pizza in the country, I FINALLY was in the area of business with an meal time to spare... Okay, so I lied.  I flew in purposely a bit early, so I could have a friend pick me up and grab lunch with me here.  (To be fair some of my other coworkers were on the plane with me, so it was probably a good call).  So we stuffed ourselves on three pizzas:  Sonny Boy - Enjoyable pizza, and I kept thinking that my wife would've loved thsi since they used olives.  But for those that aren't olive fans, fear not, the flavor of the olives is somewhat muted likely thanks to the heat of the oven and combines well with the saltiness of the salami.  Tasty combination, but not a clear winner...  Rosa - Chris Bianco's personal creation and contribution to the world of pizza, the pistachio, red onion, rosemary, parmesan pizza is quite simply... spectacular.  While it sounds odd, the way the pistachios roast with the oil on the pizza, combined with a slight bight of the red onion and a rosemary/parmesan flavor to smooth things out.  This really is a spectacular pizza, and our favorite of the three.  For those that like your crust a bit stiff, this is pretty ideal as well, as you don't have the fresh mozz and sauce pushing on the thin crust to make it soggy.  Seriously, get this pizza...  Margherita - We ended on a margherita, and as many margheriitas, it's phenomenal for the first few minutes straight out of the oven.  The primary issue with Neapolitan style pizza is that it's crisp/firm right upon exit, and within 4 minutes or so, the middle will soak the sauce/moisture from the pizza, and become soggy surely but steadily... all the while, the flavors of the basil/mozz begin to meld better with the sauce.  That being said, this was still a great pizza, and being able to taste the difference from the first slice to the last slice is eye opening in terms of understanding how the ingredients play together over time.  A classic that worth getting.  Verdict:  Bianco lives up to my years of waiting.  Is it the best pizza in the US?  I don't know if it deserves that designation necessarily... is it one of the best pizzas I've had in the states so far?  Absolutely.  My only regret is not having enough stomach to try one of every pizza on the menu... Will be back whenever I can make it!",

    "text": "This is my favorite pizza spot in North America, so why do I not award it 5 stars? I'll get to that later.  I've been to Bianco twice in my life. I consider this to be the Holy Grail of pizzas (in the US anyway). Paul Bianco is a master when it comes to crafting the perfect pizza pie. The crust is always perfectly cooked and flavorful. He only uses fresh ingredients, such as the basil which he grows himself in his own garden. Paul takes so much pride in his work that you will actually find him preparing each pizza and cooking them in his oven. When he pulls each pizza out, he looks like a proud father as he checks out his work.  I've read many articles including one from the NY Times proclaiming this to be the best pizza in the United States. In my opinion it is. But keep in mind that this is Italian style thin crust (sorry Sparkley) which is not for everyone. You will not find loads of toppings and a chewy crust like you will at find at Round Table. But what you will find is a pizza similar to what you would find back in the old country.   Why take a star? Here is why. Pizzeria Bianco opens at 5:00, but do not even attempt to get here then because you will have absolutely no chance of being seated. Ok, how about getting in line at 4:30? Nope, wont happen. 4:00? You're willing to stand out in the hot Arizona sun for an hour for the best pizza ever right? fuggedabouti, it aint happening. If you do not arrive at least two hours before you will not be dining here. In fact, we have always arrived around 2:30 and still find a small line always forming out front.  On the bright side, there is a bar right next door (Bar Bianco) where you can sit and pass the time. But a member of your party still has to stand in line until 5 to put your name on the list. Once your name gets on the magical list, you are free to join your group and have a drink and they will come and get you.  No Jennifer L, no dessert is offered here. That too is kind of a bummer.  If you have the time and it's not May through September, I highly recommend that you check out Pizzeria Bianco. The pizza is absolutely amazing and you will not be disappointed.  One tip, they do take reservations for parties of 6 or more.",

We arrive to an hour and a half wait (which we expected with 5 people) and enjoyed some drinks in the bar next door as we waited. The bartender was excellent and the atmosphere was great which was really the highlight of the visit.  When we sat down I was surprised at how small the dining room is, but I guess it explains the continual waiting list. A small room isn't a problem unless you pack too many table in so that there is no room for your server to do his job without continually bumping your chair/elbow/table/head, which is exactly the case here. Our server was very attentive and nice but he just didn't have enough space to properly serve the table.   We ordered salads and some pizzas to share and the salads were very salty. Quite strange to have a salad with that much salt, and I've never experienced it at another restaurant. The pizzas were all very underwhelming too. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, just average. I had much better pizza a few blocks to the west although I don't remember the name of the place. All-in-all the experience was a disappointment and I don't see myself returning any time soon.",

I have NO idea who he is and what his job description is besides opening the door for people but he seemed very out of place and odd, especially if you've been going here for a while. He even pointed out and said \"There's Chris Bianco\" as he exited. I thought it was weird and unprofessional.   Everything tasted equally delicious this time but they had music playing, which was different and it just seemed like a different dynamic. I hate to be a snob about this place but I enjoyed it just the way it was: No one was overly attentive, Chris (now his brother) said bye to you as you were leaving, and you knew what to expect.  I know Chris and his business partner split up but I hope this isn't a beginning of some change. I'll still continue to go there and hope the \"new guy\" backs off a little.",

We were expecting the wait, but they were still irritated about it. They weren't nice to the staff, the staff thus wasn't nice to us.   However, the pizza is absolutely amazing. So, we went back a second time, just me and my husband. Our experience was much more delightful. We enjoyed a bottle of wine during our three hour wait (and therefore were not drunk as one reviewer suggests) and excellent conversation. The ambiance is wonderful. The staff was very friendly since we were friendly to them. We were not rushed to eat quickly, although the pizza is so good it is hard not to shovel it in your mouth! Overall, we were quite pleased and look forward to going again.   I'm not sure how one reviewer said it cost her $70 for her meal. Pizza's are $10 to $12, I'm sure soda isn't all that expensive, and salads range from $6-9. Must have left a pretty good tip!   We've had the Biancoverde and Rosa, as well as the Spiedini for an appetizer. Delish. I just love this place and wish I could go more often. It's how pizza should be made!",

    "text": "I was eating at Westville in New York, NY a few years ago and got into a conversation about food with a guy at a neighboring table. Eventually, talk turned to pizza. As it does in New York. And he told me about Pizzeria Bianco. And he said it was one of the best, perhaps the best, pizza in the USA. And of course I thought, this cannot be True. Because it's not in New York. Call it prejudice, and you'd probably be right, but New Yorkers are incapable of believing ANYTHING in New York is not the best of whatever it is. Pizza especially! Well, Pizzeria Bianco lives up to its reputation. I went twice while visiting Phoenix recently (second time was quite a long, New York-style wait) and had everything on the menu. Holy shit. Amazing. Many people I went with also thought \"best pizza I've ever had.\" One old curmudgeonly guy wasn't impressed, but he's that old guy that's not impressed by anything, so forget him for now. I liked it. Especially the white pies! Which NEVER happens because I usually think FUCK PIZZA WITH NO TOMATO SAUCE. I was WRONG. The Rosa is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. GET IT. And more. And go back. I had to wait years to visit. It was worth it. Read my other reviews. I'm not usually this nice, even when I'm nice.",

    "text": "I love the Spiedini! Every bite was freakin' awesome! The Italian Fontina is not like any cheese I've ever had before. Combined with the Prosciutto di Parma takes this appetizer to another level. YUMMY!  I love the Wiseguy! Grilled onions never tasted so good. The weirdest thing was the very last bite tasted the best. It's like I'm emotionally attached to that last bite and how it made me feel. YUM!!!  I hate the Sonny Boy but I'm not an olive person. Every bite was overwhelming with an olive taste. YUCK!!!  I could of done without the 2 and half hour wait though. Since there is a wait, people get super drunk. When you're sober and everyone around you is drunk, it can be a tad bit annoying and loud. The restaurant is super small. There is no room to really have an intimate experience when people are yelling in your ear.  Also, I could care less for the service. I guess when you're not hurting for business you could act however you want. I totally don't agree with that statement. I hope the staff reads these yelp reviews and improves the service. Eventually, the bad service will outweigh the taste of the food. Then people will stop coming.  If I ever had the chance to come back, I would probably order takeout. The website said you couldn't but I saw someone who did. It also said they validate, and they do but it doesn't cover the whole parking fee.  Overall, I'm still happy that I got to experience the BEST PIZZA for myself. It's pretty cool to say I've had Pizzeria Bianco. So I would suggest anyone to give it a try just expect the wait and the rudeness. Hopefully, the food will make it all worth for you.",

    "text": "Went here again (for the third time) on our annual Thanksgiving trip out to Phoenix. I discovered that they have new hours! Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. through 10 p.m. The new hours meant no more standing in line for one to two hours before getting seated, at least if you don't arrive during rush. We drove up at just after 4 p.m. and the place was only half full. By the time we left (around 5:30), there may have been one or two seats left at the bar.   I was wondering whether the lack of anticipation and having to \"work\" for your pizza by standing patiently in line was going to affect my appraisal of it. That is, whether my rave reviews were biased by the fact that after two hours in line, steadily drinking, anything would have tasted great.  Nope, the pizza is as awesome as ever. Right now, this is my favorite pizza in the US, all styles considered. If I only had one pizza to eat for the rest of my life, Bianco's would be it. The dough (centerpiece of a pizza for me) is amazing. Light, delicate flavorful crust with a hint of sour and black flecks of char from the oven. Judicious use of quality ingredients. A perfectly balanced pie, not overspiced, just letting the purity of ingredients shine through.",

We had spent the weekend in Sedona and stopped by here before hopping on a flight.  We weren't super hungry so just got one pie to share - half Wiseguy, half Sonny Boy.  The Sonny Boy was delicious!  The salami was excellent.  We asked for olives on the side, since my husband doesn't like olives.  And even the olives were delicious!  And not super salty like most olives.   You can tell they use high quality ingredients.  The wiseguy was a little too much onion for me, and I liked the tomato base of the Sonny Boy better than the white pie.  I don't think this is a destination spot, but if you're in the area, it's definitely worth trying!  Having to valet seemed a little ridiculous - we came for lunch and the lot was empty.  Seemed silly to have to pay $5 to have a guy park our car for us, so we just street parked a block away on Monroe.",

Well, for us the answer is a complete yes to around 40 minutes in June on random weekday but to hear people say they have waited four or five hours for a table is a concept I do not think I could understand under any circumstance.  The menu is simple and outside of some small before choices do not expect anything other than pizza. The pizza, however, is indeed what the place is all about and for me I had to try the Wiseguy - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage for my first visit and I think it would be hard to imagine going for anything else.  Before the pizza the Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil was simply stunning and if the food alone was not good enough the service is a definite match to the gastronomic sensation. In particular the person (manager?) that hovered around both here and next door at the bar making sure everything was moving smoothly was amazing.  Okay, I am hungry now, but sad that I am now too far away from here for an immediate return visit!",

The combination of all the flavors meshed well and the prosciutto was pretty fresh.   We ordered the margherita pizza and the Wise Guy with mushrooms. My recommendation would be to not order the mushrooms on the Wise Guy because it made the center soggy. The margherita pizza was the better one of the two.

I was skeptical about pizza in Phoenix, but I will have to say that Bianco more than met my test. I enjoyed a nice red blend wine ($9) and a pizza that was half Rosa (white sauce with pesto and pistachios), and half Margherita with fennel sausage. The mozzerella on the Margherita was itself worth coming to the restaurant, but the pizza crust baked in the charcoal oven was outstanding. I can't really say which of the two pizza halves I enjoyed more, but I am a sucker for fennel sausage (Mozza's is a bit better and seemed more fresh, but I am not complaining).   I promised not to eat the whole pizza myself, but I couldn't help it. The crust was thin, and besides, Oprah thinks it is the best pizza ever. If Oprah says it is, then I must eat at all so as not to disappoint her.   I arrived without a reservation, and I was immediately seated by a very friendly host who kept checking on me throughout the evening. Great service and excellent food, and one of the must stops in Phoenix.",

Cute little place, with friendly staff. Thankfully we  didn't have to wait very long (plus!) and the food came out pretty quickly (double plus).  I ordered a mixed local greens salad (literally just mixed greens and vinaigrette) and my friends ordered something similar to mine, but it had skewered salami/cheese on top.  All three of us were happy with our starter, and then came the pizzas.  I ordered The Marinara (marinara and garlic no cheese) and added organic roasted mushrooms for three bucks.  It was quite tasty and I ended up eating the ENTIRE pizza.  Don't judge me, I was hungry.  My one friend ordered the pizza with pistachios and onion and I can't remember what friend number two ordered (oops), but they were both pleased as punch with their pies.  All in all, it was a nice dining experience.  The food was good, but I don't think I would wait multiple hours to enjoy a slice.  However, if the wait isn't crazy, I'll hit this cozy little spot up again, for sure!",

I'm glad I went - had the margherita with prosciutto. Delicious ! It's a quick paced environment, but everyone was attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Wow.   For quite a long time I've avoided Pizzeria Bianco. I didn't want to be disappointed by all the hype. I'm a New Yorker. Pizza is like family. Don't f-with family.   So why did I finally break down and go to Pizzeria Bianco? I had to see for myself. I had to know. I had to understand why this place is rumored to be the best pizza in Arizona--and quite possibly, the best pizza in 'Merica. We were going to a Suns game that night and thought...why not?   And is it the best you ask? Does it live up to the hype? Is it worth the long waits?   Definitely. Most definitely. Absolutely. Unequivocally. Undeniably. Yes. I have had MANY a slice of pizza in my 4 decades of life and the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is unmatched in Arizona.   Despite the rumors of long waits, our party of 4 was able to slide right in at 5:30PM on a Wednesday night with no wait at all. Valet parking at Heritage Square made it nice. The restaurant was busy and before we left, that's when the wait was just beginning. We were greeted promptly and received drinks right away. We settled in and enjoyed this smaller size brick building and checked out the crowd. It was a little drafty on the cooler December evening but the number of people in the restaurant made it comfortable.  Within 15 minutes, we had two fresh, hot, straight from the brick oven pizzas on our table. We enjoyed the Bianco Verde pizza and the WiseGuy which is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Big deal--sausage pizza. No..seriously. This is sausage from Shriners sausage factory here in PHX. Like the best sausages in town. And they didn't disappoint. Both pizzas were incredible tasting though my meat lovers both said that they thought the BiancoVerde was superb.   It must have been the Gods smiling down on us that we were able to just get right in with no wait and I'm not sure when I will tempt fate again, but seriously...this is the best pizza I've had in Arizona. Hands down. No joke. Believe the hype.",

We were fortunate to be there on a mild spring day, a slower day, chose to eat around three (between busier times of lunch and dinner), and brought cards to play while we waited. Waiting was a pleasure. What a surprise, though, I think not typical.   After having eaten there, and enjoyed it (my fav was the Sonny Boy, even though I don't care for those olives) I'd have to say I wouldn't rush to go back for a longer (or hotter!) wait at peak times. I would go back off peak with just me and the hubs, as I'm not sure everyone in our group of 14 was as enthusiastic. The hostess was fabulous and sweet, our server, while adequate, could've worked on his interpersonal skills. Take a cue from the hostess, dude.   The complimentary house bread and olive oil was very good. I didn't get to try the Rosa, maybe next time, but we did sample the Speidini appetizer (try splitting that 12 ways! Haha No, don't, it ends up being just a bite) which everyone seemed to enjoy. Come on, it's meat and cheese on a stick in a wood-fired brick oven. Can't lose. :)  I went with infinite patience and entertainment simply to enjoy the experience of it. Was it the best ever? Maybe not. But it was damn good, unique Italian interpretations, heads and shoulders above what passes for most pizza these days.",

I picked this place for my husband, who is a pizza fanatic. Even he wasn't impressed. It was good, but unimpressive. We ordered the house special salad, which was tangerines and citrus dressing, and the caprese salad. Hubby wrinkled his nose up at the tangerine salad, so I took it and gave him the caprese, which I wasn't enjoying because the tomatoes were not ripe at all, they were hard and flavorless. We got one pizza to share, half Sonny Boy and half Wise Guy. It was okay, but nothing special. On a positive note, the olive oil served with the bread is awesome, and the guy behind the bar, David, couldn't have been nicer or given better service. We enjoyed our meal because the place is cool and hip and service was great, but not sure why all the hype about the pizza.",

Groups 3 or larger be prepared to wait longer.  Although there is a nice wine bar next door and cheap beer.    The caprese salad, mainly the mozzarella was to die for.  The flavor coming out of it, the richness, the cream, the silkiness of it was stellar.  The basil was very strong as well.    I had the Sonny Boy pizza that from a set of some very simple ingredients, a perfect pizza was born.  An almost buttery crust, mild yet robust olives, salami, a perfect amount of cheese, and a tomato sauce that was not too acidic...  But man oh man, that crust is fantastic, the fired brick oven just adds a flavor and complexity to the flavors that makes you wish one could just pour liquid smoke on your crust and get the same results at home...    Now I'll have to come back for more!",

    "text": "I finally got the courage to brave the epic wait for a Bianco pizza...twice.  Is all of the hype True?  Bottom line: Amazing pizza, but not worth the four-hour wait (both times I waited close to four hours).  I got in line at 4:30, waited almost 45 minutes to put my name on the infamous list, and then another 3.5 hours or so to get seated.  I was starving and tipsy by the time dinner was served, so a cardboard box would have tasted good by then.  The \"Wiseguy\" pizza is fantastic, and so is the pizza topped with onions and pistachios.  I've never had anything else like it.     If you are still motivated to try Pizzeria Bianco after reading this review, follow this advice --   Show up at around 5:15 to put your name in, and then leave for the next few hours.  See a movie nearby, or just go home and relax.  Make sure you call every hour or so to check in... sometimes the wait is shorter than they initially say, although it wasn't both times I was there.",

The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place. There are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to.",

Heritage square is darling and I love the vibe down there.  However, we had to wait 2 hrs. for a table.  Of course we were steered next door to their little overflow bar to wait for our table.  We got drunk and ordered several small plates out of ravenous hunger during our wait..... to the tune of 50 bucks.  It's really a brilliant concept Pizzeria Bianco has down there.  Send 'em next door forever til they've spent 2x as much as they would have if they'd just gone to the restaurant.  When we were finally seated and received our pizzas, they were very good.  I have nothing to complain about except they were a bit overpriced.  The last city I lived in has a pizza place called Punch.  You can order take out from Punch and because the ovens are so hot, the pizzas only take like 3 mins. to cook. You are in and out of there quickly. .....even if you choose to dine in.  It's not as fabulous as Pizzeria Bianco, and it has counter service, but their pizza is every bit as good.  They have my beloved Buffalo mozzarella and the pies are half the price.  So myself and my visitor, having dined at Punch many times previously, were let down by Pizzeria Bianco.  Maybe it was just hyped up so much by the press that it would inevitably disappoint me?  dunno......but I believe they would do well opening a take out space somewhere in midtown.",

    "text": "Bon Appetit Magazine's 2008 Winner of best pizza in the country, and well deserved. The pizza is amazing. I have to say, the hype is True.  Me and a friend decided to go on a Saturday. The place opens at 5pm, and we got there at about 4:30pm. There were already about 25-30 people in front of us. Not too bad. We put our names down, and went next door to Bar Bianco. Bought a bottle of wine, and sat there drinking and talking. For some reason, time seems to fly by when you're drinking wine :) They came around and took our names down, said they'd let us know when our table was ready. That was nice, saved us the hassle of having to go check every 20-30 minutes.  So after a little over 2 hours our names were called and we headed over to the pizzeria. We were seated in the back, near the back door and right next to the oven. We could see Mr. Bianco making the pizza. Only took about 5 minutes for someone to come over to our table and take our order, and another 10-15 minutes for our pizza's to arrive. Wasting no time with appetizers, we headed straight for the main course.  Here is what we ordered, along with the review.  SONNY BOY (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives) Very unique taste. You can actually taste the olives, and they have a strong flavor. Not too strong as to overwhelm, but enough to appreciate and enjoy it. Salami was very good too. This is their version of pepperoni pizza.  BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula) Wow, the cheese is just... wow. I could have eaten a bowl of just the cheese. The arugula also added a slight organic aftertaste. Legend has it they make the cheese fresh there everyday, and they have a garden where they pick their arugula.  WISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) The best of the three. Good grief, the onions are on another level! And the sausage is so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely order this one again when we go back to try the other 3 we still need to taste.  The crust on all three pizzas was thin enough to draw attention to the ingredients, but not too thin that it became soggy. When I picked up a slice, nothing fell off. But this isn't the kind of pizza where you eat the good stuff and leave the crust. The whole thing is the good stuff! You could smell the wood that was used to smoke these pizzas when they get to the table.  Chris Bianco is a master of pizza. Scratch that, he's THE master of pizza. And he's fast too. If you search youtube for 'pizzeria bianco', there's a 1:11 clip of Chris making the pizza. There's also another good one of him on Jimmy Kimmel Live.  Here's the total cost for the evening: Bottle of wine - $40. 3 Pizza's + Iced Tea - $51.  If you skip the wine, it's actually not that expensive, especially when you go with more people and split the bill. And on your way out, you're bound to get a \"Thanks for coming guys\" from the master chef himself. Will definitely be going back again, no question about it.",

If it hadn't been such a long wait for the table I'd TOTALLY give it 5 stars.  I just don't think ANY restaurant is worth waiting that much time for (it was my mom's choice by the way).  Anyways, definitely glad I tried it just to mark it off the list.  However, I don't feel compelled to return for another long wait... just sayin'.",

The sausage was practically tasteless and in big chunks, very little cheese, very little sauce and the crust was so thin in places that even the almost non-existent toppings were falling off. We asked if they use the same ingredients and recipes as the downtown location and were told they do. No atmosphere, tiny, uncomfortable tables and chairs. My husband wanted a diet Coke and was told they had Coke Lite which was the same thing. It was in a glass bottle and was imported from Mexico. Why would you import your Coke from Mexico?

    "text": "* This 5 Star rating is for the PIZZA only!!!  This review is long overdue. As a matter of fact I started waiting in line to get into this joint last year and I just now had my order taken. No joke here, the lines are serious and the people in line seriously want there food. It is a long wait!! I will not eat a PB during the summer months. It's actually a seasonal restaurant for me unless I have hired a place holder. Expect to arrive early to get a spot in line. If you are more than 25-30 deep you are going to have to wait until second seating.....sometimes taking 2+ hours. That is the bad. I have been here morethan a dozen times and it is always worth the wait. I love pizza. I mean c'mon, really; Who does'nt?   My very first time I said \"Pizza is not worth this wait\", on the contrary, it most certainly is. This is not NY style, Chicago style or any other this is Chris Bianco style and it is fantastic. Hot, chewy, toasty crust with a bit of a pull. Housemade sausage, frsh grown on site vegetables and an incredibaly hot oven help create these gems. If you are a visitor from out of state DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP!  Every pie is great. The fresh fennel and sausage is out of this planet. Enjoy!!  Please don't let the wait time and snobby people bother you too much. There are some pretentious pricks who wait and feel like they own the joint because they are regulars.....ignore them. Wait...Sit...take your time and enjoy yourself!!",

I had a pistachio and red onion pizza which was boring at best, though we went with a large group so I was able to try about 8 different pizzas, with only a few being decent. The place is small, the idea they have for reservations is ridiculous. You must call a month ahead for the same day, and all the reservations are taken within the first three minutes. If you get through and ask for the next day (the next month) you are told to call the next day. It's moronic. If you want to try it, just walk in on an off night and time, and sit at the bar area. If you want real New York Style pizza, go to Buono's in Chandler",

    "text": "Despite the fact that I think \"gourmet\" pizza is an extreme oxymoron and that Bianco is one of the most over-hyped brands in America, I did try to go there one night and give it a try. It was during a beer fest (what goes better than pizza and beer?). Evidently to Bianco that is not a valid question. They were open for business (we counted 3 people inside, despite the fact that there were thousands of people just outside their \"gate\"). We walked up to said \"gate\" (an arbitrary line in the sand) where a pimply-faced teen growled at us that we could not cross over the line.  What?  We want to have dinner at Bianco's.  NO, he bellowed!  Perhaps he misunderstood his job, because the ONLY way to dine there was to enter from the beer fest.  He told us to go away.  We did.  Which kinda underscores that this place only wants a \"certain\" uppty crowd to \"enhance their decor\".  Look, Bianco, if you are so paranoid, why didn't you set up a vendor table at the event so people could buy your imaginary pizza?  Why have your shop open in a controlled event if you can't let participants eat at your joint?  The whole thing reinforces what so many say about Bianco's ... nice if you're a snowbird and don't know any better and even better if you're a paid reviewer who get \"special treatment\" for saying nice things like how the best pizza in America is located in a tourist trap in Phoenix.",

Simply put it's a place you have to go to at least once. The food is great, slow cooked, atmosphere is awesome in the old brick house with art on the walls. Just a comfortable place where you feel like you are friends with everyone eating there. If you are going for dinner plan on getting there at least by 4pm to get a table by 5-6. Or come at 5-6, get your name on the list, go to Bar Bianco, and eat at 7-8! 5 stars because I have been there 5+ times, can always recommend it and be thanked, never had bad food.",

The ingredients are so fresh you can taste them in the sauce.  The crust is not made from cheap all purpose flour, not chewy, not sweet, not greasy.  Some people may end up with too much olive oil, I haven't had that problem, but I would recommend letting your server know to go easy on the oil just in case.  The pizza creations are simple, delicious, and customizable.  I would not change the set up, great location, great spring and fall place to go.  It's a great business plan with the bar next door, but they should have small bread stick apps or something to have with your drinks while you wait.  If you really think Papa J's, Pizza the Hut, and the other terrorist franchises are better, great!  Less waiting for me and more rot-gut for you.",

    "text": "We got there at 4:30pm, 30mins before opening, and we still waited almost 3hrs. They told us we would have to - at no point did anyone promise otherwise which was admirable, albeit disheartening. Unfortunately it was raining and I was not in the mood to drink for 2+hrs before dinner (those who were had a great time next door, some had cards to play etc, though I wonder if they tasted the pizza...). Had we known, we would have brought reading material or a DVD player and sat in the car, but no such luck. Fortunately it didn't rain the whole time - we wouldn't have lasted if it had.   Now for the food. Obviously wonderful/delicious. Easily the best pizza crust I've ever had - perfect combination of crispy and chewy, perfect wood fired taste and nice and light. The toppings were great too (though the sardines were a touch overwhelming - I wouldn't do those again). The antipasto was fantastic also.  But I have to say, if this is a 10 (pretty close), there really are a few 8s and 9s that don't require 3hrs of waiting. In my mind the \"marginal utility\" of the uptick in quality, just isn't worth it. I mean if the choice was Pizza Bianco or Domino's, then of course yes. But there's Lombardis in NY, Delfina and A16 in SF - all of which are 8.5s or 9s in my opinion. We had lunch at Scottsdale's Olive & Ivy and their flat bread was a solid 7.   So basically in my mind, not worth it. But there are obviously minions who disagree. I just wonder if there's some attraction to THE WAIT for some. I think there must be - not for me though. But I will say that if the wait were an hour - I'd feel very differently. It is incredibly delicious. But 3hrs is too much.",

We must have timed it right (2:30pm) as there was no wait. We did not get offered any of the tasty bread I keep reading about, even though it was sitting in plain view on the bar.  We ordered 2 pizzas, the margarita and a sausage pizza , for the 4 of us -2 guys and 2 girls .  What a disappointment!! The pizzas were the size of a dinner plate, and they couldn't have been more stingy on the sauce or cheese!  The service was ok, but it would have been nice if the waiter smiled once in a while .  The bill came to $54 for 2 lousy pizzas and 4 ice teas.  You can have this place , I've had better pizza at Costco!",

Every ingrediant is perfection. My recommendation though is don't go hungry....you'll have to wait two hours and pass out before you get any food! With the wait, even if you don't go there hungry, you will be by the time you eat. Be prepared to wait, but understand that it is DEFINITELY worth it. I definitely recommend the caprese salad, the mozzerella is home-made and SO INCREDIBLY fantastic! Words cannot even describe how wonderful it is. This place is great for a date, the ambiance is perfect and the wait time gives you time to get to know each other. I love it!",

    "text": "I came here after hearing the rave reviews. I have to say we didn't get off to the greatest start.  We walked in passed the empty hostess station and asked to be seated outside and were told they were not seating anyone outside. The restaurant was mostly empty at 4:30 pm on a Tuesday.  The waiter was friendly and promptly greeted us and took our order.  We noticed after ordering and getting our food that the other tables that were seated after us all had bread and olive oil to snack on which was not offered to us. The pizza was good but not AMAZING.  A glass of house wine, a draft beer, 2 pizzas and two desserts was $70.  Desert was a slice of flourless chocolate cake and (per the menu) vanilla bean ice cream. What came out was the slice of pre packaged cake and vanilla bean whipped cream.  Also for desert was biscotti and espresso. The espresso was great but the biscotti were soft and flavorless. After they brought dessert out we noticed the hostess staring at us every time we looked up. The dining room was beginning to fill up as we were now entering the dinner hour. We had been there less than 40 min total from the time we walked in. Still the outdoor seating was completely empty and they were now on a wait and sending people next door to Bar Bianco. We may have stayed and had another glass of wine following desert but we felt pressured to leave to free up thee table.  I definitely was hoping for a better experience overall and would not recommend Pizzeria Bianco based on my experience tonight.  I was really  underwhelmed after believing all the hype.",

It was very good different than usual with roasted pepers, squash, etc.  She also tired the tomatoes with mozzarella which she liked.  We tried the Margherita which we loved.

    "text": "First off, if you think you can beat the crowds just forget it.  I didn't even know there were enough people in Phoenix to crowd a place like this and cause a 2 hour wait on a random Tuesday night.  Also while the food itself is very well-priced for the quality that you get I think this place makes its real money off it's bar next door where you will most likely wait 2 hours and order some drinks to keep your sanity.  So in other words unless you like waiting in line outside expect to spend some money in the bar while you wait.  The pizza's themselves seem to live up the reputation.  Anything you order will have the kind of chewy but crispy crust you'd expect from a place that claims to be one of the best pizza joints in the US.  The real star of the show  though, is the toppings.    I was lucky enough to try two pizzas, the Margherita and the Rosa.  The Margherita had the freshest tasting mozzarella and basil on top of a tomato sauce that wasn't overpowering.  I knew I had to order the Rosa just because the toppings looked so odd (Onion, Parmigiano, Rosemary, Pistachios) and I was blown away by how well everything completed each other.  Unlike some pizza joints that just pile on toppings that tend to blend together, all of the toppings on display here were distinct and went together superbly.    This is one of those places that I would love to keep coming back to, if it weren't for the darned line.",

The wait is because the place is tiny but the pizzas take time and any bigger of a restaurant would lower the quality of the pizza.  I ordered the fontina cheese wrapped in proscuitto over a bed of arugula, and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the marinara pizza- just plain with only sauce and garlic. I also ordered the Wise guy and the Margherita. The crust is amazing on the pizza. You can also order 2 pizzas per person to go, which is what I did to bring them back to Chicago. Just reheat them on a pizza stone at 350 degrees for 3-5 minutes. I found the staff extremely polite and friendly. Service was great.   We arrived around 3:15 pm on a Friday. I just want to add that there is parking lot next to the pizzeria. Also, what out for skippers. There was a couple who skipped a lot of people, and unfortunately, the staff wouldn't get involved.",

The environment is pleasant where they're located in Heritage Square, and you can have a beer or a glass of wine next door while you wait. If you're not finished when your table's ready, you can bring it on over with you. Super accommodating for their small establishment, but definitely worth the wait.",

    "text": "Well we finally got in. About seven attempts and five years later we finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco. I think the only reason we got in is because they are now open for lunch. We were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before and went to the restaurant, there was already a 45 minute wait. We put our names in and didn't get called before we had to leave to see the performance. We got out of the performance at 3:45 and decided to hustle back to Bianco and see if we could possibly get in before the dinner rush. We spoke to the hostess and she fit us in! Yay!   The menu is minimal about five different pizzas, appetizers and salads. As we looked at the menu we decided to order everything we were curious about as we didn't know when we would ever make it back. So we ordered the Antipasto - wood fired veggies with big blocks of cheese, bright green olives and sopressata, served with bread and the most flavorful olive oil. The perfectly roasted veggies included sweet onion, red peppers and sweet potatoes it was wonderful! We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita, wise guy and sonny boy. The pizzas were good. We enjoyed the pizzas with Peroni which is a perfect pairing. My favorite was the wise guy. Wood roasted onions and fennel sausage - just incredible. Everything was cooked perfectly. Our tab for three pizzas, antipasto, beers, and sodas came to $92. Pricey lunch but we ordered too much.   I think I felt slightly stressed during the meal as the service was speedy and I felt a bit rushed. Maybe it was my Catholic guilt rising up feeling like we bumped someone else from getting in earlier. It was a lovely meal, lovely building, but it was not relaxing.   We took home an entire pie - a mixture of the three. Stuck it in the fridge and can you believe it actually tasted better the next day?? We warmed it in the oven and it was so delicious!   I'm so happy we finally ate there - cross that one off my list. I don't feel compelled to drive all the way into Phoenix and wait in line for hours any time soon but I would do it again. Probably when I have guests from out of town and someone else is driving so I can enjoy lots of red wine while I wait.  I'm torn between 4-5 stars but I'm feeling generous.",

    "text": "My wife and I visit Greater Phoenix a couple times a year.  Our fave restaurant is Pizzeria Bianco.  I have a story to illustrate how good the place is.  This is not a joke - this actually happened on our first visit.  As we were advised to do, we arrived several hours before they opened.  This was back when they had more limited hours and they weren't open for lunch.  We waited in the line, but it wasn't too hot out, and we had a nice time.  When we finally sat down, we were hungry.  But before we could order, a very normal looking middle-aged woman entered the restaurant and approached our table.  She said her son was visiting from out of state and they had to take him to the airport, and they didn't have time to stand in the line, but her son's favorite thing in the world is the Sonny Boy pizza from Pizzeria Bianco, so would we mind ordering a couple extra pizzas to go when we ordered our meal?  Apparently Pizzeria Bianco doesn't accept takeout orders, but they will give you a pizza or two to-go if you order them as part of your meal.  Before we could say no, the woman was already thanking us and I had $40 in my hand.  We were stunned.  When our server approached us, he asked if we knew that woman.  We said no, and we told him the truth when he asked what she wanted.  He told us he'd take care of the situation, and he went outside to chat with the woman.  Then she stormed back into the restaurant, told us we threw her under the bus, demanded her money back and marched back out of the restaurant.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.  We started with the Antipasto with the awesome roasted veggies, I think we had the Caprese salad and we had 2 of the pizzas - the Sonny Boy and I think the Wiseguy.  Fantastic meal.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.",

    "text": "Lured by the hopes of experiencing pizza nirvana, we went to Pizzeria Bianco for dinner.  I had some margherita pizza ($13) and biancoverde ($16).  The margherita pizza was made with fresh ingredients, but it just tasted OK, nothing too special (Good crust though).  I was more intrigued by the biancoverde pizza.  The creamy ricotta and mozzarella meshed well with the more piquant taste of the parmigiano-reggiano and the almost nutty, crispy taste of the arugula.  The pizza was somewhat oily in the center and slightly soggy in the middle though, but that didn't detract me too much from liking the biancoverde.    We were a large party of 8, and service was OK.  Minus some points for not getting a sugar basket for our iced teas despite asking for one (I like them sweet!).  The iced teas themselves ($3, free refills) while nice in that they were organic, really didn't have too much taste to me.  It was so mild I thought I was drinking colored water.  They offer Mexican Coke in glass bottles ($2.50), which is a nice touch for those that want real sugar in their regular Coke.  Is this pizza I would wait 3 hours for?  Not really, but if I came on an off day or a less busy hour I would be willing to try some more pizzas from them.",

It fills the veggies and pizzas with a wonderful charred & woodsy flavor.  Do not be discouraged by the hour's long lines because it is worth it. You have two options to make this more bearable. Show up before 5:30 and skip the line or make your reservation and get a drink at the bar next door. Just let Bianca know you'll be there and they'll come get you when you're up.  Everything here is cooked in the oven and this makes a huge difference in taste. Everything comes out crispy and flavorful it's too bad new wood fire ovens are outlawed. They have local brews but by no means is it a prolific selection, the beer is better at the bar next door and you can bring your beer into Bianca from there if you'd like.  It's a charming early settlement construction similar to the 100 years+ pizzerias in NYC. If you like Pizza you'll love this place.",

    "text": "The food at Pizzeria Bianco was okay, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed in my experience. It may have been that it had been built up for me for a long time, but the wait was long, the food wasn't the greatest, and the place itself was a bit cramped.  1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don't take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time.  **One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.  2. Food: I don't quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing.   3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side.   I don't regret this experience at all- I have to say it was worth trying, just because it was rated the \"Best Pizza in the US\" by various celebrity/food critic sources. I just personally wouldn't claim it as the best pizza I've ever had.",

While the pizza cooked in the wood fired brick oven, we snacked on homemade hard crust Italian bread and olive oil.  The pizza arrive in 15 or 20 mins and did not disappoint.  The crust was perfectly cooked and the toppings were fresh, hot and delicious.  It's a small space and often a long wait but well worth it. If it's busy, put in your name and head next door to Bar Bianco until your table is ready.  The location is a little tricky to find since it's on a one block long pedestrian only street between E Van Buren and E Washington. There is valet parking off of N 7th St or garage parking off of N 5th St by the Arizona Science Center.",

    "text": "Valiantly braving Saturday afternoon crowds and, the hellish seventy-degree weather that is Phoenix winter, I fought the good fight to eat here today. It was worth all the fuss.  My visit began at their wait-tank next door, Pizzeria Drunko (placeholder, forgot the name) where in my short two-hour wait I was able to consume five beers and a half-glass of wine, whiling away the afternoon, lusting for the highly coveted Bianco Pie.  My reward was a platter of the brightest green and tastiest olives I've ever eaten, a salad fit for royalty, and a pizza so indescribably delicious, I simply can't find words.  And that's when it hit me.  I was in the magic kingdom of pizza.  I summoned the server immediately and ordered three more pies, ate one and took the remaining slices home where in the last sixteen hours, I managed to eat every last slice.   No-one in my family is waking up to cold pizza this morning.  You hear me?  No-one!  PS. The margherita with prosciutto was the best, followed by the fennel, the biancoverde with red sauce, and who knows what the first one was, I inhaled that one.",

    "text": "I have been here twice and the pizza was excellent each time I came here.  On my most recent visit, my wife and I met my friend from out of town along with his wife and daughter.  My friend has had pizza all over the U.S. (especially New York/New Jersey area) as well as Italy since his entire family is Italian.  Since he lives in New Mexico, he judges all other pizza places against a restaurant called Farina.  Everywhere he goes, he orders a simple margherita and compares it against Farina's margherita.  My wife does the same and she makes excellent pizza at home (hand roll thin crust from scratch, fresh herbs from our garden, and in the past she even blanched tomatoes to make sauce from scratch).    My friend rated the pizza here close to the same level of Farina and I would agree.  These are two of the best pizza places in all of the United States.  The seating is very limited both inside and outside.  I would recommend using the valet parking if you have a nice car (for $3 and piece of mind) and getting here early.  We arrived at 4:30PM and put our names down for five people.  There was a small market happening nearby so we passed the time by walking around and checking out various booths before returning to the restaurant around 5PM.  My friend arrived at 5:15PM and our table was ready by the time he arrived.  We were quoted an hour to an hour and a half wait, but I think many of the guests eating here are very considerate to try and finish their meals quickly knowing the line outside to get in is very long.  We'll definitely have to check out their second location near the Biltmore area.  We ordered margherita pizzas and his wife (gluten free) had salad and an appetizer sampler plate.  The pizzas were excellent though the sauce could have used a few Italian spices (rosemary, oregano, thyme, and basil).  It tasted like it was home made (blanched tomatoes) with a hint of sweetness just the way we like it.  The thin crust was perfection and you can really tell they use fresh mozzarella cheese and the basil probably came out of their spice garden just outside the restaurant.  I like my thin crust to have a slightly burnt taste/portion and they delivered on this (though not too burnt).  I like my pizza spicy so liberally sprinkled red pepper flakes all over each slice with a little bit of parmesan cheese as well.  For dessert, we shared an order of biscotti.  My friend and his wife had wine and it came out to $100 including tip for four people.  My wife and I often share margherita pizzas and we only drink water so if we ate alone it probably would have been $18 including tip for two people.  I can't wait to check out their second location.",

Got a couple of beers and got a table at the Pizzeria before we even had a chance to finish our drinks. Valet parking for $3 in the adjacent lot. Service was fantastic! Super friendly with a smile.

I checked the website for menu and hours before making the trip. Someone had suggested to order ahead as the wait can be long, even on a weeknight, so while driving, I called ahead. No one answered but the voice message gave hours which suggested they may just be too busy to answer. Upon arrival, they were closed.  At 6 pm on a Tuesday evening. Their website and voice mail clearly stated 4 pm to 10 pm Tuesday-Saturday. There was another couple standing outside as well, in similar disbelief.  What a waste of a drive.  Luckily Federal Pizza was just a few miles up the road and they were not only open, but the staff was great and the pizza was outstanding. Very poor job of maintaining public communication.  Fail.

I was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they won't seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.)  I thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add.

The service is fast. I went around 2 pm, after the lunch rush and it still felt like the lunch rush. I am from New Haven, CT where pizza is serious business and people will stand in line (rain or shine or even snow) for a pie from their favorite place. New Orleans has their trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper) and New Haven has the trinity as well: Pepe's, Sally's and Modern. Anyway, back to Bianco. The the pies were excellent. For me, it starts with the crust. It was thin, very flavorful and held together with a firm texture that didn't just fall apart in your mouth. Kind of reminded me of the pies back home. The edge of the crust was puffy, crispy and had a few really dark spots. It was delightful. The sauce on the margherita was superb. Simple, not too thick, not too thin and adhered to the crust really well. The flavor combos on the wise guy were perfect. I like a little kick and would have added it if it were available. I never had the chance to ask our waiter as he was busy and did not check in on us. My only criticism is that the menu is what it is. Unlike the majority of the pizza universe, you can not create your own combination at Pizzaria Bianco. Aside from this, Pizzaria Bianco makes a fabulous pizza.",

The desserts there, absolutely divine!  The quality of food, service & ambience is always on point!  Love all things Bianco!",

    "text": "I'll have to admit I was slightly disapointed with Pizza Bianco.  Although giving them three stars reminds me of the first college class of my freshman year when I walk in the first thing out of the professor's mouth to the class was a C is a very good grade.  I wanted to give them more than three stars after reading a bunch of the reviews and the anticipation of eating the pizza, but after thinking about it for a few days it is not worth more than three stars to me since it was just good, nothing more.  I read reviews that people waited hours for the pizza since the building only holds 40 something people, somehow on a Friday night at 7PM the wait was only 45 minutes.  Right around the 40 minute mark our table was ready.  We already knew what we were getting in advance since the GF and I always get the margherita pizza when we try a new pizza joint. They served free bread and olive oil and we ordered diet coke which is in a glass bottle and labeled \"Coke Light\".  It reminded me of the European Diet Coke that I had in Paris.  The pizza came out relatively quickly, probably about 15 minutes or so.  I jumped on the first bite and after my first bite I thought it was pretty good.  And after I got done with the first slice my opinion did not change. Definitely not the best pizza that I ever had (the best was Tony's Pizza Napoletana, San Francisco).  With that said I would have been very disappointed if I waited more than an hour for this pizza.  This was my first time in Phoenix and if I can make it back I would try Cibo and many other pizza places with good reviews before I would come back to Pizza Bianco.",

My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.  Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.   I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there.",

It was a hot, hot, Phoenix summer day, noonish, and there is a bit of a walk from the station to the restaurant.We arrived red faced and thirsty for water- sat down at an empty table,(of which there were many) and were immediately asked to move as our table had 4 chairs and we were a party of 2. We did not wish to sit by the windows, where our server was directing us.  It was hot!!!  So we went to the bar.  We were the only customers at the bar, asked for water, and waited 10 minutes before receiving a glass or a menu.  We were then told that a water pitcher was outside.  Bottom line-  the attitude at Bianco is not worth your dollar.  Too many great pizzerias have opened so their product is no longer unique or exceptional.  Shame on them.",

Oh well must be our lucky night.   Nice wine list. Had the margherita pizza and the rosa which had pistachios. Margherita was one of the best pizzas I have eaten. The mozzarella melted in your mouth. The rosa was just ok. They seem to be best for simple pizzas. Also had the local organic greens salad which was very good. Dressing was not too heavy. Very reasonably priced for the quality and we didn't have to wait!!",

This little place was all my wife could talk about for the last 10 years. Living on the east coast for years you could imagine her excitement when we finally made it Phoenix to try this quaint little pizza shop in heritage square.   Upon arrival after the lunch rush, they greeted us warmly and seated us straight away. Once seated the waiting game began. With only a third of the restaurant and the outdoor seating area full we waited almost 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. No welcome, no hello, not even a have you dined with us before?   I never having been there before started asking basic simple questions about the menu and any information I wanted was available to me as long as I asked the correct questions. No explanation nor tour of the menu options were ever provided nor were we told about items that were available that are not on the menu!   The order was taken and that was the last time our server checked on us for the entire meal. Our server kept walking by to see to her other tables not once coming over to see if we enjoyed our food or beers. The beers went dry about half way through the meal and the water ran out shortly afterwards. My wife was embarrassed for all the people she raved to about this establishment. She touted it to be the \"best\" in the country and what we were left with was an absolute fail!  The pizza is interesting with high quality ingredients and delicate subtle flavors. However, it is not the best in the country and know where near the most exotic or exciting flavors that they should be boasting to make this place amazing.   I wanted to love his place but instead I have left never wanting to return to this particular location. Really unfortunate!",

Since we arrived on a Thursday at 12:30 pm, there was only a fifteen minute wait. The place isn't very big which is why there are long wait times especially on the weekends.   Everything on the menu sounded good. This is what my aunt and I ordered.   Rosa (5 stars) -  The flavor combination was brilliant. I would never think to add pistachios to a pizza. The distinct pistachio flavor transformed with the balanced combination of red onions, parmigiano reggiano, and rosemary. The texture of the crust was yummy and what to expect from a wood burning brick oven.   Sonny Boy (4 stars) - The toppings on this pizza was a good contrast to the Rosa. The tomato sauce was tasty, and there was just enough mozzarella cheese. They used good quality salami. I'm not huge fan of olives on my pizza, but these olives were delicious.   Service (5 stars) - The staff was friendly, and we did wait too long for our food. They even offered to take our picture outside since they do take many pictures.   This is must try for locals and tourists when you're in Phoenix.",

Well, we were not disappointed and wondered why we had not been here before. The reported long waits had scared us away, but on this day, we walked right in at the 12:00 noon opening.  We started with the antipasto and went right for the pies!! Delicious, unique, and very flavorful!! Service was truly great and friendly...non-intrusive but available.  Sharing pizza with family at Pizzeria Bianco was a memorable experience we will definitely do again and again!!!

We got completely lucky and walked up a little after 8pm and there was one table for 4 open. Don't plan on this, typically people wait hours to eat here. The inside of the restaurant holds maybe 50 people?  We ordered 3 different pizzas and shared them all. Literally they were all great. The Wiseguy had just the right amount of sausage to make it our favorite choice for carnivores. The pistachios on the Rosa were amazing and locally sourced. The Margherita was good but not great. It was actually the only pizza that left a little to be desired. If you're looking for the best that Phoenix has to offer make sure you go visit Bianco.",

In about 10 minutes I was served the beautiful pie with fresh tomato sauce   basil leaves and melted mozzarella . The aroma was killing. Had to immediately plunge. I happened to make friends with a lady who was at the bar and having the Wize guy ( pepperoni ) and happened to be staying at thane hotel and came in just few minutes before I did . We were talking about missing each other , else we could have shared a pizza instead of taking back left overs for breakfast ! So back to the aroma .... I quickly drifted from my conversation to my pizza and couldn't keep myself off the pie. The lady friend commented \"looks like you may not have left overs \". I wanted to play decent so stopped after my 4th slice. Two more to go and I asked for a box. We wrapped up paid and walked back. I got to my room , changed and sat down to work . All my mind was focussed on was \"The left over pie\" . I couldn't wait till breakfast . Not sure if it was my hunger or the pizza , I opened the box , found a plate and heated it slightly on the microwave and in no tin they left over was history !!! That's my tale of Pizzeria Bianco. It was irresistibly good ol plain pizza executed with simplicity.",

Service was good, appetizer was good. Sauce had no flavor, no depth, no texture no spice. By the way saying Oprah loved this place - complete turn off what does she know she's from Chicago where they think deep dish and eating pizza with a knife and fork is the best. We were the only ones at the bar eating our pizza the right way - Brooklyn fold,with our hands.Good try, but swing and a miss",

Good things are worth every dollar. Fresh ingredients and an explosion of flavor in every bite. The pizza section is a small but very unique with their ingredients. There are additional toppings available. This place features a good selection of wine and beers. The pizza is thin crust and the crust is amazing. The Wiseguy is a great choice ( caramelized onions, mozzarella, and fennel sausage) Simplicity is key to this exquisite  tasting pizza. The Margherita is another excellent choice. Pizzeria Bianco is the best when it comes to pizza, the place is small and lovely, and it's also in a beautiful location.",

As a former server I understand slow service if you're busy, but we were literally the only table in the entire restaurant-- and I don't think Kari cracked a smile once.

I suggest getting a Margherita and then adding toppings like Sopressata if you're not too adventurous with the other pizzas on the menu.

Their text messaging waiting experience allowed us to explore the surrounding area and even let them know that we needed a few minutes to get back to the restaurant when our table was ready.  My wife and I both ordered individual pizzas and neither of us were disappointed.  We are both from the NY/NU area so we know good pizza.  This wasn't good pizza, this was great pizza.  I loved that the crust was well-done.  The menu is small but that was a non-issue because everything seemed to be great.  Two of the best pies that we've ever tasted...with no leftovers.",

Started out OK, but when were were trying to finish our meal the server kept constantly coming and taking away our plates as she thought each person was finished....whether you were or not....the crust is great and some of us wanted to drizzle the olive oil on it, but we did not get the chance; the plates and the olive oil were whisked off the table in flash, no chance to dawdle! She even took the flatware from my friend WHILE she was finishing her plate! That was the last straw....I know you have to turn tables, but this was ridiculous.   We will not return, not a good feeling, not a pleasant experience. I have had pizza just as good elsewhere in the Valley and had a much nicer experience and treatment...I did not know this was a fast food restaurant :(",

Portion was good and the ingredients were very fresh.  The service was fast but not rushed. The wait staff was very friendly and efficient. We were in and out in less than an hour.

WISE GUY ($18) - Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage - cooked to perfection - I enjoyed every last bite of it - The onions really brought out the flavor of the fennel sausage - Definitely recommend!  SERVICE: I sat at the bar and the bartender was really friendly. All the staff members seem to enjoy working with each other to help the customers are happy. I didn't know there was bread offered but the bartender highly recommended that I try the bread with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  ENVIRONMENT: very casual. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. Depending on the day outdoor seating may be a great option while sipping a glass of wine or draft beer. Inside dining may be a little cramped but the pizza will definitely make up for it!  Overall, I would NOT hesitate to visit Pizzeria Bianco again. The pizza was crispy and well flavored. I even hear if you're lucky you'll see Chef Chris Bianco making your pizza himself! The prices are similar to any fine pizzeria establishment. There is valet for the rich and famous, otherwise a parking lot free for 2 hours with validation.",

    "text": "I think the hype really affected my expectation of the place. Best pizza in the country? ...arguable.   We are in Phoenix for a few days and I had a few places already bookmarked. The magazine on the plane raved about this place as well as thrillist and some other foodie sites. Did I want to wait and hour and a half for the best pizza in the country? Not really...but I would have kicked myself if this place was right by my hotel and I didn't try it  We ordered the sonny boy and the wise guy. Great combinations and the topping to sauce to crust ratio is pretty on point. If you're looking for saucy, doughy pizza oozing cheese this is not for you. You get a delicate crust with light cheese which is the way I prefer it.  I was unimpressed with the crust though... Parts of it was too burnt to be edible.   Overall their menu was too limited to be satisfactory. Two pizzas was too much for two people, but the salads were boring and the appetizer were scarce in options.  Good, but not one and a half hour good...and definitely not the best I've ever had. $18 for a pizza that size is also ridiculous. To each his, or in my case, her, own",

My friends were vegetarians and my meat-lover self was completely outvoted, so we tried a few pies that I normally wouldn't even glance at on the menu. We tried the Rosemary pizza...and I learned I'm allergic to pistachio's - who knew!?  The Margherita pizza was truly delicious - crisp, flavorful and the aroma of the basil was delightful.  We expected a long wait, and got an even longer wait.  On the plus side, it gave us more time to drink lots of wine and catch up!   I hear the wait times have improved as of late and am happy to see the expansions of this restaurant.   Looking forward to my next visit and trying new options!   Great local pizza place, proud to have Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix!",

    "text": "This is just a love hate relationship...ha. We all know no one REALLY likes to wait 2-3 hrs to sit and eat..a pizza at that, but at the end of the day, it's worth it. Here's the key, plan on making a night of it.  Enjoy some wine next door (you have no choice ha) and sit back and relax. We like to order the olives with a nice glass or bottle while we wait. Be careful though, it's easy to drop $$$ before you even sit down to eat. The pizzas are truly amazing. Some people make it sound like they're heaven on earth...not so much, but definitely live up to most of the hype. By far my favorite is the Bianco Verde (no sauce, heavy arugula) so fresh and delicious. Everything is just so fresh and I gotta give this place love for the great mozzarella. You cant go wrong with any of them so choose what you like, I like to get the Margeherita sometimes and just add what I want . My biggest advice...order the fresh sliced garlic on the side. WOW.  The cottage next door is cozy and romantic. Def not your norm place, and not somewhere you want to be stuck with someone you can't hang out with while you wait. The restaurant is very cool, brick inside, dimly lit and the man himself is there throwing each pizza in the wood fired oven one by one.  So yes..do go...do give a try...and yes...hate to love it.",

During summer months, outdoor seating is only for those who like to sit in saunas while having dinner.  We went next door to Bar Bianco and had a drink and some nibbles of goat cheese crostinis to pass the time, which really went pretty quickly.  The hour wait well worth it.  Anyone who says this place isn't worth the wait obviously doesn't know good pizza.  If you don't want the wait, and don't know good pizza when you eat it, please just go to Pizza Hut.  That will make MY wait here shorter.  We started with the organic baby greens salad, and then my husband and I had the Biancoverde, which comes with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula.  My parents had the Margherita, with added mushrooms, onions, and olives.  Our 8 year old daughter had plain cheese.  She HATES trying new things and gave this place 2 very strong \"thumbs up\".    I would put this place on par with the famous Grimaldi's in NYC.  3 pizzas, 5 people, no leftovers.",

    "text": "I saw the mention in that book-- was it \"The Best Pizza in America\" or somesuch?-- and since I was living pretty nearby at the time I dragged my sister out to get in line at 4pm or so.  The pizza was most definitely not amazing, stupendous, or even particularly impressive.  It wasn't horrible, it wasn't inedible, but it wasn't worth the hype and it was not worth the wait.  I would give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 stars, but it gets worse thanks to the atmosphere.  My sister and I chose what we were going to order and she excused herself for the restroom, and the waiter came over while she was away.  He made it quite clear that I had one chance to order and I would not be able to make any changes or additions once he put the order in.  Between that and the hectic din and the general sense that this place was all that and a slice of pizza, I was sort of let down.  As someone else here pointed out, though, the bar next door was actually quite nice.  Pleasant atmosphere and definitely more relaxed.  We chatted with the bartender for a time before we realized that we needed to get in line to get our name on The List so we could come back to the bar.  Hmmm.  I say take the time you would spend waiting on line for Bianco and spend it with friends and family at your favorite local pizza joint.",

    "text": "It took three tries to eat here. The first time we called (Sunday), it was closed. And according to their voicemail greeting, Pizzeria Bianco was booked for the next two months. The second time, we were told that there was a three hour wait, at which news we freaked out a little and ended up going to another restaurant. The third time, we showed up an hour before the restaurant opened so that we only had to wait TWO hours for a table. We were in Arizona, dammit, and by golly we were going to eat at this pizza place everyone kept recommending even if it killed us.   Luckily, they strategically opened their bar next door at 4 p.m. so that we could drown our boredom in cider and Mexican Coke while we waited. Their hostesses were stunning and very sweet, and very skilled at keeping hungry people happy during a two-hour wait.  We ended up ordering the Margherita, Rosa, Biancoverde, and Wiseguy pizzas. The Margherita and especially the Biancoverde were quite good and light. The Rosa and Wiseguy were very salty and oily. I wouldn't order them again. Still, the meal felt satisfying.   Pizzeria Bianco reminds me very much of Basic in San Diego; both places have the floppy, slightly charred, thin-crust pizzas, the rugged brick walls, the wood burning oven. But Basic has no wait, better hours, a full bar, cheaper pizza pies, and more toppings to choose from.  So is Pizzeria Bianco worth the wait? Sure, but more so you can say you experienced a Phoenix institution than for the food. 3.5 stars.",

I have heard of people waiting in line for hours to get into this place, (I can see why, food was great) but we were a party of 5 and we were able to walk right in, have our preference of a table. (We also went at 1pm on a Thursday) I love the Neapolitan style pizza, I recommend the Biancoverde. It is similar to a formaggio base, with arugula. The food was fabulous, I was a little disappointed with the service, I would have wished the server to be a little bit more knowledgeable about the menu, and be able to tell us about the pizza (such as if they made their own mozzarella, what type of products we were ordering, if they made their own crust, ect), other than that I would recommend this place to anyone!",

So we just moved here from Portland and had eaten at the best wood fired pizza in the nation (see previous reviews if you're ever in the portland area).    Pizzeria Bianco was recommended by a friend that owns a wood fired pizza oven, so we definitely were expecting the best.  The wait is everything everyone says it is... 1+ hours. We waited in the bar next door and I asked if they had a Rose wine and was told that they had one not on the menu. Now here is where it's both our faults.. I never asked the price and she never offered it.  I was a little shocked to say the least when I got the bill for $50, it was good but not that good.  We headed over and ordered our pizza.  We got the Fennel Sausage pizza and honestly it wasn't that good unfortunately.  The sausage wasn't crumbled and it didn't taste like fennel very much.. Just really uninspiring.  Service was not that great either. We sat at the bar and the guy rushed us and I just didn't feel the love.  So hate to do it but yeah... two stars.. I really wanted to like it but it just fell short.",

And if we didn't like it, then at least we'd experience it.  We actually arrived almost an hour early because we weren't familiar with the area and thought we could walk around the area to find out that there's nothing around there to go. But on the other hand, we were first, FIRST in line. After 10 minutes into us waiting, a steady number of people started to come line up. By the time they opened there were at least 100 people behind us. While we were waiting, there was a blonde lady that was annoying. She kept walking in and out of the restaurant...possibly the owner. She had this attitude that she was better than everyone else, driving her Mercedes. Not cool. And while we were eating she was chatting up the servers and the chef.   Also, they do make reservations of some kind because we were not the first to be seated. The restaurant was half way full before we were seated. While we waited for our waiter and food, I would watch the chef make the pizzas by hand and he seemed to be so happy. You can definitely tell he loved what he was making with a big smile on his face. Where else could you see that?  We ordered: Antipasto - My bf's favorite, vegetables were roasted perfectly Rosa Pizza - My favorite, the red onions were not overpowering and the crunch of the pistachios were great WiseGuy Pizza - Sister and bf preferred this one over the Rosa, the Fennel Sausage was very flavorful  The wait is a bit ridiculous...i wouldn't want to come back unless we were towards the front of the line again. But the food was very good.",

It was so nice and the atmosphere is really easy and fun.  I didn't order the GF pizza this time around but I had the olives, which were killer.  The olives were so good the second time around we ordered 2 plates of them! mm... I also had the salad with the fennel and it was absolutely delicious.  It was dressed perfectly, not too light and not too heavy... the salad was just refreshing.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also had a side of salami and that was also great.  The pieces were cut thinly and I really enjoyed the salami with the olives and even my salad.  Awesome!  My dad had the Sonny Boy pizza but he subbed in sausage. The sausage was delicious... I stole a few pieces off of his pizza.  Bianco is fast, easy, affordable and the obvious, Delicious!  Go there!  If you live in Phoenix, or are visiting!  I highly recommend.  Also, we did not encounter the so called 2-hr wait people in the area talked about.  I guess we got lucky, but were also there during the week days and during work hours.  Enjoy Pizza Lovers!",

The parking sucked, the wait was ridiculous (we went out for an appetizer at Majerle's while waiting and had a better time with better food), and the beverage situation for non-alcoholc drinks was just plain stupid. Atmosphere was way too loud and the waitstaff seemed scattered/discombobulated. Won't be back any time soon, just not impressed enough to bother with it.",

    "text": "So my trip to Phoenix didn't start out great.  I was in town for a conference awhile back, but while my flight got in on time, my bag handle broke almost immediately after I started to wheel it.  I managed to keep it together by holding it closer to the ground, and got aggravated talking to several bus drivers who couldn't tell me a damned thing about how to get to the light rail.  A lesser man might've just taken a Super Shuttle to the hotel on the outskirts of Phoenix instead--not me.  I've been to just about every single major pizzeria in the NY-metro area.  I had mapped out the route to what is supposed to be the best pizzeria on the planet--Pizzeria Bianco.  I was going to get there hell or high water.    So I dragged this bag onto the bus, figured out the light rail system, and then walked a couple of blocks to the pizzeria.  I was struck by how idyllic the street it's on was.  Looking at photos of the building online, it looks like a big, imposing structure.  Instead it's this little village-like area surrounded by the Phoenix science center.  I came in all beat up and the staff was gracious enough to allow me to shove my bag in the back.  I plopped down at my table ready to order (I came at lunchtime so no line).  Thank God it all was not for naught, as Pizzeria Bianco was worth the trip.    I decided to go with Mr. Bianco's 2 favorite pies: a marinara and a rosa.  Yes, I got 2 pies by myself: fuck you.  Marinara pies are not normally my thing but this one was exceptional.  First off, the crust was light, fluffy with some crispness, significant char from the oven and a certain \"freshness\" to it.  It wasn't one of those old world, rustic, converted-bread recipes that some places in NY have, but it was great in its own right.  The tomatoes used were of the highest quality, and with little spikes of oregano and crisp slivers of garlic, their flavors were brought out to the fullest.  It was as simple a pizza as you can get.  Much more complex and out-of-the-box was the rosa.  It's that same great crust topped with crumbled Arizona pistachios, pecorino romano, red onion, and rosemary.  That sounds weird, but it's fucking incredible.  One of the best single pizzas I've ever had.  Chris has called this pizza his 'the metaphor of me'; I agree to the degree that I can, as this pie is absolute artistry.  I've not had a pizza like it before or since.  Even though a few copycats have popped up, they don't come remotely close.  Then I noticed the man himself walking around, and Chris Bianco came right over to me given what I ordered.  We talked shit about Arthur Ave, the Bronx and baseball stuff for a few minutes, and we ended up talking to another table from Brooklyn.  Chris Bianco is a genuinely great guy living the American dream, and I think it's awesome that he has mad scientist hair because in a good way that's what he is!  I grab a quick picture with him, wrapped up my leftovers and ordered another pie to go (Sonny Boy, great but not as good as the other 2), but then got talked into some homemade chocolate gelato.  I am very glad that I did!  It was exceptional as well, almost a perfect melding of chocolate and extra-icy ice cream but a little more towards the chocolate side.  Considering the heat I was about to walk out into, it was the best idea ever.    I saw that Chris Bianco added a new Italian restaurant on top of the wine bar, sandwich shop, this pizzeria, and the others that he has opened.  Holy shit do I want to go (to all).  He's a little off the wall, but he knows what he's doing when it comes to restaurants and his passion is almost incomparable.  His story is very reminiscent of other great American success stories and proves that the American dream doesn't die so easily.  High-minded rhetoric aside, Pizzeria Bianco lived up to the hype and is worth going well out of your way for (I'd try to avoid the lines though).  If you're one of the mindless critics on here bashing this place without an actual argument or story to stand on, then fuck you.  You can see my story, and I'm sticking to it.",

Overall:  Food:  Lacking in options but delicious.   Prices:  Expensive Staff:  Couldn't wait to get you out of there.  We felt very rushed, as if the main concern is to just churn through paying customers.   Overall:  Not the best pizza in the US, maybe not even in AZ but worth checking out.

Takes 4 minutes to cook, the Rosa was better of the two. But both good. The GPS got confused and parked us around the block. Service was great, food was great. Like the very thin crust, no sauce pizzas one eats in Italy.  I think the price is a bit on the high side. Pizza & beer shouldn't be more than $15, a limited menu specialty restaurant that flips its tables every 30 minutes and a line at times of the day shouldn't have to charge this much.  (or is the rent that high in central Phoenix?)  star off for that.",

I would love to go back, however, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) Most frustrating is that you pay for parking,  directly next to the restaurant in (what appears to be) a private lot, and you must use the valet in order to park directly next to the restaurant. I understand parking is available elsewhere, but when you've travelled a distance to eat here and are hungry and have been anticipating this visit, you just want to eat.  So we used the valet. He made it clear to us as we got out that the  $5 was a parking fee and did not include any tip. And he works off of tips. We were in and out of the restaurant in under 40 minutes. Seems crazy to spend $50 (see number 2) and pay $5 for parking + tip for just over a half hour. 2) We had a party of 4. We ordered 2 pizzas and had water. Our bill,  with tip, was $50 and (as mentioned in number 1) we were in and out in under 40 minutes. I have no problem paying a premium price for amazing food,  but I want to leave satisfied. Instead,  we left hungry and started planning our next food stop. Good news is I was hungry enough to try another restaurant in this wonderful city.  Hope this is helpful!",

By the time we showed up we dwindled down to 10 and were sent to wait next door at the wine bar while they got our table ready (which was WAY better than waiting outside in the heat.)  After 10 minutes they came to get us for dinner, and once we got inside I went to tell the hostess that we had lost two more, and she could take back a table and two chairs for other parties. She rolled her eyes and walked away without responding, which was kind of weird, but I wasn't going to let her attitude kill my vibe.  Our waiter was very cool, nice, and helpful. We ordered several pizzas and bottles of wine for the table.   The pizza was delicious- I had the Margherita. It came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  Payment was really easy despite the several split checks we needed.  Will definitely return the next time I visit Phoenix.",

This restaurant is quite famous and everyone has wonderful things to say about it so I had to try it and put in my 2 cents.   I met a co-worker here one Friday evening (pretty busy) and I have to say that I was blown away! We were able to get a small table outside and enjoy a bottle of wine from next door, as we waited for a table. If you're not in a rush and enjoying your company, the wait of 45-60 minutes shouldn't be a problem. As we were seated, yes you notice that you are a little crammed but if you can get over that fact and enjoy a quant little authentic different place to eat you will enjoy yourself.   The pizza is cooked brick oven style, has thin crust and is a little burnt around the edges..... OLD SCHOOL! The pizza sauce and the fresh topping make this pizza yummylishious! I liked that it was thin crust, not full of grease and wasn't your normal pepperoni or olive pizza! Fresh basil leaves, round fresh sausages..... just FRESH! Everyone who worked there was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The menu isn't huge, but they have a variety of pizza, salad and appetizers to choose from. They are also pretty quick with getting the pizzas out, so once you have waited for your table, there is not too bad of a wait to get your drinks and food.  I would recommend this place for more adults on a date night then families. It is family oriented, but it's so small having larger groups is harder for them to accommodate. If you don't want to wait very long I would say try visiting this place on a week night, before the dinner rush. I enjoyed Bianco's and will definitely drive the 40 minutes again to have dinner here!",

Was quickly greeted and seated which made the experience even better.  Started with the house salad which was simple yet delicious.  Dressing was excellent and not overly applied on the greens.  Complimentary bread with olive oil were nice.  The menu has many options; however, did find some of the additions a little pricey.  Ordered the Biancoverde $18 and added prosciutto $6.  $24 for a pizza is a little steep; however, the service and ambiance made it worth while.  Great selection of beers and wine.",

    "text": "The pizza's here are OK  - pretty good, but nothing special.  They are the pizza's that we've come to expect at pretty much every pizza place with a wood burning brick oven over the last 20 years or so.   We expect quality ingredients, fresh arugula toppings, etc.  So they are not re-inventing anything here.  The menu is very small, with limited selection of toppings and combos.  Two pizzas and no drinks for two (we got btl at bar before we sat down) was $50; which is fine, but i definitely wasn't 'wowed' by the pizza.  In fact, I've had much better, and for less.  I've also paid more - so price wise, this was in the middle, although maybe slightly above average.  This would have a 3 star - A-OK rating from me rather than the 2 star 'meh- i've had better' rating - if it wasn't for the deplorable, disinterested service.   We had great bottle service at the associated bar/waiting area next door.  Unfortunately, the same friendly and attentive service didn't carry over to the dining room.  If they had truly great service, they could bump this rating up to a 4 - as in 'I'm a fan' - but they'd have to get an entire new staff probably to pull that off.  The hostess did not seat us, but rather pointed to a table for us as we walked in and she walked away.  The waiter never engaged us other than to say 'have you decided\" , shortly after we sat down.  We had - so we ordered.  But a simple courtesy greeting such as 'hello' or 'good evening' would have been both appreciated and socially appropriate.  Our pizza's arrived, and we ate them, with no question of if we needed anything else.  The hostess later came by to check on us (not our waiter), and asked how everything tasted.  I commented that it tasted like pizza - which it did.  Like every other pizza that I've had at any decent restaurant over the last 20 years.  Which is to say - it's very good - just not mind blowing.  Our waiter later returned when we were done eating and cleared our plates and asked about dessert.  We indicated interest, and he brought a menu.   The hostess momentarily followed with our check with an offer to 'take it as soon as we're ready'.  I'm not sure if they just have really bad communication between the staff, or if she was unable to notice the fact that we were looking at the dessert menu or what her problem was - but it was extremely rude to present the check at that time.  We were still drinking our wine, and looking at the dessert menu.    The prices are more than other similar pizza places, but only by $2-$3 per pizza - no big deal.  Sp overall- if it weren't for the disinterested and abrasive service, I'd be back if in the area, although I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  However, given that one of the reasons I go out, is to be waited on; this isn't a place I would choose.  If i were in the area, I might consider for carry-out; but I suspect there are other places within a few blocks with similar/equal quality pizza - perhaps better.  I'm looking forward to checking them out over the next few days.  Hopefully, we can get better service than the 'panera bread-esque' type service we received here.  if they had it set up as counter service rather than table service, I likely wouldn't have thought twice about the service.  But since it is set up like table service, and they only offer 'counter service' - it's a quite disappointing.  It didn't take any detective work at all to see that  no one in the place was getting full service, and that the staff had clearly not been hired or trained to provide such service.",

    "text": "I was one of Those People who insisted I would never, ever go to Pizzeria Bianco.  I had no interest in waiting 3+ hours for the privilege of eating pizza.  Bah Humbug!  Wait...  what is this?  PB is open for lunch? On Saturdays?  Without a wait!?  OK, I take that all back.  Let's go!  On a recent Saturday we made our way to Heritage Square.  I approached the little restaurant/house building with a hefty dose of skepticism.  Could it really be *that* good?  The space is not very large, and was nearly full at 11:30.  Grabbing two open seats at the bar (with a great view of the wood-fired oven), we decided to try two pizzas:  Sonny Boy ($16) - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Sopressata (salami), Gaeta Olives.  As I am not a fan of olives, I asked for this to be served without them.  It was really just OK.  The crust was slightly overcooked making the edges more burnt than charred.  Also, it was sliced haphazardly, making the slices strange sizes and shapes.  I was not very impressed.  Until the second pizza arrived:  Biancoverde ($16) - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. This was a very interesting and tasty pizza!  A perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  The Arugula was a nice contrast to the perfect blend of cheeses and garlic.  And, unlike the Sonny Boy, this crust was delicious!  About a week later, I had the opportunity to enjoy a couple of other PB varieties (in addition to the Biancoverde) during lunch with a few (skeptical) co-workers:  Rosa ($13) - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  This sounds like a strange combination, but it works!  Wiseguy ($16) - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  Good, but did not take the place of the Biancoverde as my favorite.  It was fun to watch their nervous expressions at the sight of an arugula-covered pizza turn to smiles of delight at their first bites.  So, I am glad I finally gave PB a try.  Will I ever wait hours and hours for these pizzas?  No!  However, you may find me there at lunchtime, savoring a Biancoverde with a smile.",

Might be great for area - but I've had better Neapolitan pizza in the US (including my favorite little place back home Pupatella). I did get to introduce my friend to Neapolitan style pizza - something he'd never had - but not sure I'd do the hour plus wait here again.  We ended up sitting at the bar since that's what opened up first and the bartender was great and didn't mind me practicing my Italian on him. I loved the house made mineral water. The toppings are all top rate on the pies, the sauce fragrant and flavorful, but alas the cheese and crust were a little disappointing - the crust in particular lacked flavor).   Our pies: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil (my staple for judging any Neapolitan pizzaiola's offerings - Really would never get this again; very disappointed in this pie)  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives (solid pie - great toppings make up for the flavor-lacking crust)  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage (best we had - perfect blend of flavors and aromas)  I'm giving Bianco 3 stars even though I've had better Neapolitan pizza. We had a good time and the staff was friendly - to give them lower would be unfair. But I really was fairly Meh about their much lauded pizza.",

Pizzeria bianco has thin crust pizza prepared in an old school brick oven. The waitstaff is friendly and you can tell that this place is definitely popular among the locals given that it was busy even at 2pm on a wednesday afternoon. The menu isn't extremely large, but it's the quality of the ingredients that count in this case.  Tried out the \"Sonny Boy\" and the \"Wise Guy\" pizzas and both tasted pretty good while coming straight out from the oven. This is NOT your typical pizza spot with supreme pizzas, but a place you go to enjoy the creativity and the craftmanship of someone's idea!  Note: Valet parking costs about $3",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco     During my first ever trip to Arizona there was only one must stop place on my list other than In and Out. (I'm from the midwest) and it was Pizzeria Bianco. I've been know to eat some crazy toppings on my pizza and was warned this was pretty basic. Once I arrived I was impressed by the set up. Bar Bianco next door complete with appetizers, the outdoor seating complete with games to play and the fact that our table was ready before the appetizer was ready so they just delivered it next door to us.  The setting inside transported you away from a busy downtown area to another place in time. We tried the antipasto with roasted vegetables, sopressata, and cheese. It was delicious especially the roasted beets.  When we looked at the menu it was clear, the selection was simple only 6 pizza's to choose from. My first selection was the WISEGUY wood-roasted onion,house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage. Why? Because it was the most out there ingredient wise. It was excellent the slightly charred crispy crust and the combination of the onion and fennel sausage was excellent. Then I made the mistake of trying both the Sonny Boy and the Margarita pizzas, it does not matter what was on them other than the red sauce. I'd eat that red sauce off the sidewalk. I've always heard if you are going to a simple dish you'd better do it well and Pizzeria Bianco did. Chicago and New York are known for pizza but I've never had a better slice than I did in Phoenix.  Pizzeria Bianco, back to basics pizza done right.",

Third, no reservations and your party MUST be present to enter. Note: no pepperoni - salami is the option (just incase the kiddos are fussy.) Sausage pizza - yum! Cheese pizza - yum! Cheese pizza NO sauce - yum! House salad dressing - yum! Loves this place.  All three kids ate all of it! A BIG thank you to the staff for rushing our order to get us out in time - incredible service!",

    "text": "So I'm always a little biased or not biased particular when it comes to Pisa I believe that you shouldn't charge a crazy fee for pizza you know like it's double cheesy might throw some meat on there I do sometimes find it kind of ridiculous if you are going to go to a place like this particular piece of real and probably walk away was a 52 $60 bill because you know it's Pizza but the pieces that you get at this place is pretty decent. And decent might not be correct it's it's really good like you're not going to regret the meal you might look back and look like a heavy Bill especially if you're getting wine in her drinks with the meal I think like let's say you just get a meal there for two people in my run E-40 if you get drinks or appetizers it'll run you 5260 probably but it's a nice location like it's less no group drink night I think they go more for like you know a little date not too fancy but enough where I take somebody that you're just meeting there or taking on a second or third date like your date's not going to be mad at you. Once again the food is delicious I'm not going to put that down sometimes I'm just one of those people that think now you can go and get like a nice thin crust pizza at a good amount of locations around here and there's other options that might have a little bit of better atmosphere that are almost right down the road that if you're if you're looking to impress somebody just buy food that might be pretty equal and price is going to be pretty equal at but the venue might be a little bit better but once again if you want to place you don't have to really have to wait for you'll still get great food and you will live on the app side of central I recommend it",

While waiting for our table, we were directed towards the cabin next door that also had a bar. Very cute, rustic feel. Indoor and outdoor seating available.  Drinks: Hot Mexican Chocolate and Warm Cider  The hot chocolate wasn't too sweet or chocolaty, in fact it was a little bitter. The cider was refreshing with a subtle hint of orange and ginger.   I was with an individual that had a nut allergy, and one of their pizza's was topped with crushed pistachios. We asked if they could make it without pistachios and we were told no. Ultimately, resorting us to two options on the menu.  Pizza: Margherita and Biancoverde Nothing special about the traditional pizza. The biancoverde was better than what I was expecting. It's a no sauce, and had a delightful blend of cheeses.   Overall, this place was definitely busy for a Saturday night, but I don't think they are as vegetarian friendly as they could be.",

For example, The New York Times wrote that this is the greatest pizza in the United States, and Alan Richman ranked it number four in the country as well.  Even after adjusting for the hype factor, I thought the experience was worthwhile. I recommend the Margherita with prosciutto, but not the pizza with fennel sausage. I'm not a huge proponent of Los Angeles-based Pizzeria Mozza, but the sausage itself is done better there.   I planned my dinner here as a side trip during Spring Training, which is relevant because it's the busiest time of year. If avoiding a four hour line is of any interest to you, the smartest way to approach to dinner at Bianco is to plan your entire day around it. If you check in at 4 PM on a Saturday, the line should be about an hour long.   Since this kind of wait is involved, the area surrounding the restaurant becomes a scene. In fact, our waitress and hostess both looked like models and so did a handful of the patrons. Killing time next door at Bar Bianco is advisable.",

Success! the place was virtually empty.  there is something magical about pizza cooked in a wood fire oven - it really has the best taste.  obviously that great taste stems from the organic ingredients and homemade mozzarella though! and on top of the wonderfully charred outer crust, it comes out in mere minutes. happiness for the A.D.D in us all :)  you can never go wrong with margarita, but for something a bit more unique we decided to get the biancoverde - ricatto cheese on pizza is always a good thing, and the arugula piled on top only added to the deliciousness. It's traditionally served without sauce (server warned when we ordered, which was nice since we didnt realize), but they will add sauce to it if you like. im sure its great as its intended but i enjoyed it with sauce.  we split between 3 of us for 2 slices each. decent for a small meal (since the crust is really thin). saw several people ordering a whole pie for themselves but i think splitting between 2 people is perfect to finish completely and be satisfied.  i was kickin myself we didnt order the caprese salad that comes with their fresh baguettes sliced along with it. so bright, so fresh and delicious-looking.  the chocolate shaved ice was a nice ending...light and airy.  i loved the building, part of the historic buildings in Heritage Square of downtown phoenix. The little garden boxes out front and around the corner are charming.  Free valet parking for customers.",

    "text": "Now I just want to preface that I'm from San Francisco, where we have PLENTY of amazing pizza choices, so I may be a bit spoiled when it comes to that. And considering the hype surrounding this place and the build-up it created, I had a pretty high bar it would have to reach to match or exceed the places in SF.  Came in on a Tuesday afternoon around 5pm. Wait was 45 mins. Part of the reason for the long waits is that the restaurant is tiny, but I was ok with the wait as long as the food was as good as its been storied to be, so moving on.  For the most part, service was okay, although for the small amount of tables each server is in charge of, I would have expected a little more attentive/faster service. I won't take off any stars for that though as it was busy that afternoon so I understand.  Now for the food. Ordered the Sonny boy and the Wise guy.  Yes they were decent and flavorful, but out of this world, best pizza I have ever eaten? Nope. Not even close to be honest. For the price they charge, I was expecting a little more. Its missing that \"wow\" factor - as I said, decent and flavorful, but thats about it, and thats something I could get at any reputable pizza joint without having to wait 45 mins and pay nearly $20 for.",

Knowing that he was not manning the oven any longer, I was interested in trying it again.   I stopped by on Saturday night and put my name on the list at about 5:30. My girlfriend and I were seated at about 9:30. I ordered the Wise Guy and she ordered the margherita with prosciutto on half and sopressata on the other half.   My Wise Guy was great with the fennel sausage and onions. Hers was great too with the spicy sopressata and melt in your mouth prosciutto.   Even though Chris wasn't around it was a great meal and remains my favorite pizza place in town for a special occasion.",

Our neighbors in CA recommended Pizzeria Bianco and we had to try it.  They open at 5pm so show up around 4pm and get in line.  While you wait (here's the genius idea on their part) you can grab a drink at their bar, which is just next door.    I love the crust.  It's chewy and has a great bite.  The menu is small but satifying.  The flavors are clean and fresh.  Just good old traditional Italian pizza.  I had the Biancoverde with proscuitto.  It's divine!  My husband had the Wiseguy - it seems to be a favorite among the guys.    The pizza is cooked in a traditional wood fire oven.  The ingredients are simple but the execution is wonderful.  It's all about clean fresh quality ingredients.",

I couldn't have been waiting for more than 5 minutes when they called my name though! I can't remember the name of the pizza I ordered but it was a white pizza with caramelized onions and fennel sausage and it was pure heaven.",

It was a hot day and they wanted us to wait on the side patio in the sun with our newborn in his car seat. Not a great arrival experience there. The restaurant itself reminds us of some pizza spots we visited in Italy, small and charming. Service was on point and the pizzas were tasty. Menu kind of small, Wife also ordered the tomato and mozzarella which was quite good. They serve soft drinks out of bottles hecho en Mexico! This is a great spot and we will definitely be back most likely before a future baseball game.",

And we were there early enough for Happy Hour.  Our table was ready shortly and we were able to be seated, order and get our food very quickly. We had the wiseguy, margherita, and bianco verde. They were all delicious but I think we all agreed that the wiseguy was our favorite.",

We had no idea bar wasn't first come first serve as most bars are. The door was open because guests were just walking in so we didn't see the sign. The host ran inside and yelled at me in front of everyone. He could have just come up to me. It was very rude and embarrassing. It's not like I knew!!!!  Anyways my friend really wanted to stay. So during our wait we went next door and got drinks. I like that they have the bar next door very unique. Drinks were fine.   For dinner we ordered the market salad, the pistachio pizza, and margarita pizza. I honestly LOVED the salad and enjoyed the pizza. While the pizza was good it wasn't stand out. Our server was very nice and attentive.",

Nothing really stood out, all of the ingredients were just okay.   I'd never wait for a table here.

That may have been True 10 years ago or so, prior to the explosion of Neapolitan-style pizza in the U.S., but now that this style is a dime a dozen, this is really nothing special.  I thought the crust was good, but the pizza was under-seasoned and needed salt.  Had the standard margherita, as well as a \"wise guy,\" and they were both fine but nothing better than your run-of-the-mill Neapolitan pies you can get everywhere these days in NJ, NY, etc.  Glad I went for the experience and the bragging rights of having tried it, but found the taste to be underwhelming considering the universal acclaim it has received over the years.",

    "text": "ok, I know I'll probably get a lot of flack for not rating this place 15 stars, but I gotta be honest...  We went for a friend's birthday since we needed a special occasion to wait 2.5 hours for a table.  We were told we could wait at the bar next door (bar bianco).  It was great, pre-drinking is always a good time, but about 2 hours into the wait we went to check on our table and we were told we were taken off the list because we didn't check in every hour!  We were never told this was required!! Oh well, it added another half hour to our wait time...annoying but whatever.  3 hours of waiting.  Once we finally got seated, we were so excited from the anticipation that we were immediately let down by the service.  We told our server we were celebrating a birthday, and he said \"you and three other tables.\"  Hmmm...well, ok, I guess you deal with special occasions a lot.  I'll sum up the rest of the visit:  food was good, but I'm sorry, not great.  Service was average, no enthusiasm about a wine recommendation, and I guess they don't believe in water refills. And lastly, our birthday girl wasn't even offered a dessert or a drink.  I'm not expecting free stuff, but I think it's just restaurant standard to make the b-day person feel special in some way, right?  All in all, maybe because of all the hype, and the 3 hour wait, we expected more.  Oh well.",

    "text": "We arrived for lunch right at 11 and waited for them to open the doors. There was already a good size crowd waiting to get in. We were seated right away and service was fairly quick (total lunch took about an hour, not too bad for sit-down service).   Since it was a work lunch, we couldn't have any beer or wine. they have 3 options: Coke, diet Coke or sweet tea (all bottles). No fountain drinks at all. That was fine by me, water is cheaper. It is worth noting that the beer they have on tap (Thunder Head or something ) is REALLY tasty and VERY hard to find anywhere else. It's available next door at Bar Bianco.  They only have 6 pizza options and 6 additional topping options. If you want fruit or something on your pizza, you better go somewhere else, because that's not what they do.   I had the Rosa pizza, with parmegiano reggiano, red onions and pistachios. it was quite good, but not amazing. Two friends had the margherita pizza and one had the one with fennel sausage. One friend LOVED his margherita pizza but hated mine; I had a piece of his and thought it was bland. The guy who had the sausage pizza found it to be so-so. I always thought they got a little crazy with the sausage. It's pretty strong tasting stuff, you should go easy on it.  After lunch, don't expect dessert. They don't have any. They do have a huge coffee machine, so you can have your espresso or cappuccino.   If you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait. You can make reservations for 6 or more, but you have to do that weeks in advance.   Honestly, no matter what you've heard, this is NOT the best pizza in the Valley. La Grande Orange does it as well or better, plus they have more topping options and are more than happy to give you a half and half pizza. This place is a little snooty. My friend had a salad and wanted to add the fennel sausage to it (he's on a protein diet). They said the sausage is for the pizza only! Really??  So, if you really want to try it, go right ahead and make up your own mind. Maybe come at lunch time. Not nearly as busy and it has all the same food (unlike Cibo, which has a different menu at dinner). But you would probably be happier at Cibo or La Grande Orange. Both make awesome pizza with more options and are way more friendly about it.",

    "text": "It's pretty hard to find a better wood fired pizza, it's the little things that set Pizzeria Bianco apart!  It is a little on the expensive side, and the waits can be a little long, but don't let that stop you.     First off, the wine bar next store is perfect.  We usually grab a bottle of wine and a cheese plate and enjoy the Hertiage District gardens.  There's also a pretty decent pub across the street, but since the wine bar is linked to Bianco they'll come find you there when your table is ready-a small bonus.  Of course, the real reason to come is the pizza!  Supposedly Chris Bianco spent a few years hunting down the perfect flour, water, and yeast for his unique pies.  Whether it's True or just a legend, the taste seems to back it up.  The crust has a perfect light and chewy texture that's still crisp on the outside.  It has a nutty flavor that I haven't had anywhere else, probably a combination of the wood smoke and overnight resting of the dough.  I usually go for the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, salami, and olives)  but you can't go wrong with any of the six pizza choices I've tried.  If you do go for an option with the red sauce, you'll be impressed by the simple, fresh taste of the superb tomatoes.  The cheese and remaining ingredients are every bit as fresh and complimentary to the balanced flavors.  Bianco is the perfect special occasion pizza.",

Well, based on the taste, I wouldn't  have minded waiting at least 30 minutes for the food.  it was amazingly good and I still talk about this pizza to my coworkers.  I had the WiseGuy and the server promptly informed me that it does not come with any red sauce but I can add it, which I did of course.  The flavor was right on and the crust was thin but did not have the cardboard texture like other pizza places.  The pizza was so good it needed nothing else added to it.  Not even red pepper flakes!  I highly recommend this place as the food is great and the service is equally great.  Whenever I am in Phoenix, I go to Matt's Big Breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco.

    "text": "Good pizza in Arizona??! Whaaaat?!!  Yes, that's the story to this place. Man grows up in Brooklyn, falls in love with Arizona, moves himself to said Arizona, opens a pizza place and BOOM! You have Pizzeria Bianco.  So being from NY, and after hearing much hype about this place and how, according to one NY Times critic, it could be even BETTER than NY pizza, I HAD TO HAD TO try this place.  First off, let me start by saying that for an out-of-towner, this place was quite hard to find! It was facing the street but within a closed restaurant square just outside of Arizona U. Considering that we were driving and didn't know the area, we drove around and around the area a few times before we decided to just park the car and take it by foot. After parking the car and putting approx 8 quarters in a meter that robbed us of 20 minutes (max 2 hrs but we were prepping for the long wait that is also associated with this place), we walked only to find a parking lot right next to the restaurant. Grrrrr.... Lucky for us, we went on an off hour and had no trouble getting a seat.  Next up, upon walking in we noticed that the place was teeny! No wonder they have such a long wait!!! I know that they're pizza was modeled after old recipes, but did they're structure have to model the old tiny places that the old NY pizza joints are also known for? I'd say no... So anyway, we sit, get a menu and are a bit thrown off by the prices considering the sizes of the pies in front of other patrons. $18 for a personal sized pie with only sausage on top??! Whatever... By this time we were a bit perturbed but fully committed. We paid our meter, lost the money, were seated, hungry and extremely curious about what all the hype was about. So bam... $18 gone for a little pie w/ fresh sausage on top. I swear this better be good!!  About 10 minutes after ordering we received our pizza, fresh from the brick-burning oven with cheese melting and sausage steaming. Looked good; smelled good... damn better taste good too! We stared at the pizza for a while as we tried to soak in the size vs price and come to terms with the absurdity of it, took our slice and took a bite...  The suspense as we chewed, absorbed and swallowed. Was it even better than NYC pizza? Was it deserving of all the hype from Oprah and Diane Sawyer? Did it deserve to have up to 3 hour waits? Answer: No. As a New Yorker who has tried many of the old greats (Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, John's, Joe's, etc.), and even some of the newer ones (Pulino's), the answer was a definite No. And my goodness man who wrote the review in the New York Times, were you really being honest or did you just have a connection? That said, for Arizona, it was definitely fantastic. In fact, for the nation, it definitely falls into my top 10 pizza places within the U.S. Will I be back? Most likely not. I have my fill of NY pizza when I'm actually in NY, and I can't seem to swallow paying $18 for a pie that I could honestly finish myself on a good day. Will you regret it if you visit Pizzeria Bianco? I'd say almost definitely not.",

The dough they make for the pizzas is something I've never had before and I lived in NY for quite a while. My wife was a bit disappointed as it didn't have red sauce on it and she wasn't aware of it when we ordered. So we ordered the Sonny Boy to go for dinner tonight. My only negatives (not enough to ding a star rating) were that I'm diabetic and ordered a cappuccino and they don't offer sweetener...only Sugar in the Raw. I understand \"keeping it real\" but it kinda sucks for people like me. I hate being forced to pay for parking too (Parked 30 feet from entrance)...just the way I am.

Food was flavorful and the inside of the restaurant is fairly small for how busy they are, but the service is very attentive and probably are slightly rushed due to demand for needing tables.  Next time no blind date experience there for maybe that impacted my flavor buds! FYI, they have Valet that must be from the 7th street side else they do validate your parking if parked in the garage by the Museum. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have been to Pizzeria Bianco a few times now and have loved every visit!   My trick is to get there around 4:15 (during months when the weather is nice), get in line, and send someone to the bar to grab drinks to make waiting in line a little bit more enjoyable.  Doors open at 5, you get in with the first seating and you're good to go.  Or, if you don't get in the first seating, you put your name on the list (maybe a 45-60 min wait) and you go find a table in the bar and order an appetizer.  My first trip to Bianco, I was wondering if I would be able to tell if it really was better than the rest.  (Please note, this was several years ago when I was early in my \"good pizza\" knowledge).    For me, this pizza got better with every bite.  It went something like . . .  First bite:  Yeah, this is good. Second bite:  Wow, I really like this sauce. Third bite:  Man, these tomatoes are really fresh! Fourth bite:  OK, I'm impressed, the sausage isn't greasy at all!  The Wiseguy and the Margarita are my favorites.  Oh, and I really love that arugula one.  Ok, they are all great.  They have a great antipasto platter too!  I understand that people are frustrated by the long wait and the small space.  What I don't understand are all of the demands or suggestions.   \"Bianco needs to do something about the long wait.\" \"They need to serve us faster.\" \"They need a bigger space.\" They need to do this . . . They should really do that . . .  The way I see it, they really don't have to do anything!  It seems to me their business is running quite well as it is.  If they choose not to open up more tables, or get a bigger space, or whatever it is, at the risk of lowering the quality of the food, then I have to respect that.  Just my two cents.  Take it or leave it.",

    "text": "Ambiance: Cozy little restaurant in a former shop/house. Red brick walls, open ceiling with exposed wooden rafters, warm glow of the brick oven makes this place as cozy as it gets. Tiny place though, 12 or so tables and a tiny bar area. Tables outside as well. Patrons mostly in the 30-60 range, white collars on business dinners and dating couples. Noise level is a bit high but not too bad.  Food: Gourmet Pizza rules here, considered by most culinary critics to be the best pizza in the state. All pizzas feature high ingredients to create unique flavor combinations. If you're used to Pizza Hunt/Dominoes/Papa Johns this will be a totally different experience. My favorite is the biancoverde, no tomatoes just mozzarella and ricotta topped arugula. Restaurant also willl full bar and decent beer/wine list.  Price: Gourmet pizzas = Gourmet prices.   Service: The place is usually packed and pizzas take time but considering this service time were actually not bad at all.  Overall: An Excellent little gourmet pizza restaurant with big time coziness factor!",

If you like saving money definitely park in the parking garage in back, it's only $1 with validation instead of the $5 valet parking in front.    They have a nice selection of Arizona beers.    For pizza we got two- the margherita and the 2nd pizza had 1/2 Biancoverde and 1/2 Wiseguy.  The pizza was fantastic, thin crust, cooked perfectly.  The margherita was very simple but tasty, the marina sauce was delicate and a tiny bit acidic and blended great with mozzarella.    The Wiseguy had a thick layer of wood roasted onion that enhanced the fennel sausage.  The biancoverde was almost too salty but the arugula on top was a nice counter point.    We had leftovers to take home, I think the perfect amount would be 1 pizza and an appetizer for 2 people.    We had rice pudding for dessert, creamy and delicious.  Prices are not cheap ($18 for a pizza) but worth checking out.",

If I say something is True about myself, it IS True don't cha know. No person who's had ANY pizza in NYC would think this pretentious over priced and frankly snotty boutique pizza shop was anywhere near the best. I can think of many that are better. Anthony's in Denver Colorado smokes this. Wiseguy in DC the same. Shit even Hanny's downtown here is far better.  The best?  The fucking balls....  In case you're wondering, the best is probably Joe's in the West Village. NYC. Go there. Before you die. You're welcome. And it's inexpensive! It shouldn't be. Unpretentious....Pizza the way it has always been made from way before hipsters started to \"reinvent\" it and then call it more \"authentic\" so that they can then feel superior (as usual) and charge you more. And by the way it's not in Italy either, I've been there... Having a few somewhat decent pies right there in Rome and Trastevere. Most notably Dar Poeta in Trastevere.  If you want Middle School cafeteria grade pizza with watery sauce and T O N S of attitude, visit this place. You'll love it.  Come on did you really think the best pizza in America would be in Phoenix Arizona?  Right.",

    "text": "Santi and I came to this iconic pizzeria for dinner, and as usual, it was a positive experience. The wait was about half an hour for us. The dim lit red brick interior started with a patio dining area and small cozy interior with an open kitchen, brick oven, and display of their signature bread. They specialize in a small number of artisanal pizzas with a high mark up. The noise level was high, as we were seated on the counter overlooking a number of pizzas delivered to the tables.   The Margherita ($15) came with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. Their pizza crust was excellent: thin, crisp, carried great flavor and a crunch in every bite. Their tomato sauce and mozzarella were equally excellent, but more basil could have helped to boost the flavor. I also suggest interested diners who wish for a savory anchor to order it with prosciutto.   The Wisebuy ($18) was made with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. The mozzarella had a nice hint of smoke coupled with savory sausage. The onions gave sweet rise to the flavors, and the thin crust was again, memorable. I would love to have the option of ordering the Margherita to come with smoked mozzarella.  They require valet parking which was an inconvenience when there was no street parking available in the area. The price of these individualized pizzas was also higher than expected, which unfortunately, influenced my rating when compared to other better pizzas in the Valley. Service was attentive and efficient. I would be interested in coming back to try their Sonny Boy and Biancoverde.",

So of course I had to check them out.  Besides the high praise, I had also always heard to expect a long wait. So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at 6 and found several empty seats outside. I ordered a pizza, half Rosa and half Wiseguy, and some of the house white wine. The Rosa had red onion, Parmesan, rosemary, and pistachios. The Wiseguy was topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted onion, and fennel sausage. Both choices were good, but not as awesome as I had expected. I actually was more impressed with the house wine.  This is a traditional wood-fired pizza, light on the toppings and with no tomato sauce. And while I have no problem with that, I've had much better wood-fired pizzas elsewhere. That said, I'll leave it up to you whether this is one of the best pizza places in America. I definitely think it's worth a visit, but not if you have to wait three hours. And if you're eating by yourself, as I was, I suggest getting a half and half (definitely try the Wiseguy; I'll leave the other half up to you).",

We went over to the bar to wait, drink, and listen to the live music- what a great vibe! We shared the fire roasted veggies- veggies have never ever tasted so good!! Also had the caprese salad, marghertia (my fav), and the Rosa. Our total was about $75. It was expensive, but I was okay with spending that much money to get quality food!!",

    "text": "If you like REAL pizza, not Pizza Hut or other chain type pizza, come here.  If you are used to Americanized pizza, you will not like this place which is probably what a lot of the recent reviwers are having issues with.  You aren't getting doughy pizza drowned with thick tomato sauces and lots of poor quality cheeses and toppings.   I read about this place in Men's Health Magazine as the best Pizza in America.  My brother was living in Phoenix and graduated from ASU so we were there in May and I made reservations way in advance to ensure we got a table.  Wait was less than 15 minutes with the reservation.  If you plan ahead, you don't have to wait 2+ hours.  The place is really small but love the look and feel of it.  I had the Biancoverde pizza which truly is the best pizza I've ever had and I didn't think anything could top the pizzas I tried in New York from some of the mom and pop shops there.  These are fire oven pizzas so they are not going to have oil soaked crusts and will be drier, and the fact that this joint makes their mozzerlla fresh is impressive and it's OH-mazing!  My wife had the Margherita pizza which was also out of this world and my parents who travel to Italy often said it's exactly like what they have had there.  The capri salad is also fabulous and so is the olive oil they bring out at the beginning you can dip the bread in.  All in all, a much healthier version of pizza that I wish America was more excited to adopt!",

    "text": "We came out for Spring Training and decided to see what all the fuss was about. The pizza is very good. Not even close to worth the wait. It just isn't. If you're from LA, just wait to get back home and go to Mozza. If you're from Chicago, just wait to get back home and go Great Lake or Crust.  If you're from New York, just go to DiFara. You'll be getting a better pizza at any of those places AND you won't have to wait for 3-4 hrs. Sometimes in situations like these I think that folks walk away saying \"That was totally worth the wait!\" so they don't feel like idiots for waiting that long for pizza that is good, but not THAT good.   We got the Wiseguy, Margherita, Rosa, and Sonny Boy. The fennel sausage on the wiseguy was pretty weak and the pizza overall was under salted. Too much smoked mozz just made the crust soggy. The sonny boy was better but a little boring. The Margherita was great (but once again, you can get better elsewhere.), and the Rosa was awesome. If you like Parmigiano Reggiano, you will love the Rosa. I have to wonder why they even bothered with the pistachios as you can't really taste them through the strong flavored cheese, but still wonderful.   What I'll remember most is all of us walking away and asking ourselves \"What the hell just happened?!\". Again, I'm not saying the pizza is bad. It's pretty good. Just not even close to worth the ridiculous wait. Never again.",

Used to be that Chris Bianco made every pizza by hand and the restaurant was only open evenings, but now he has turned it over to his apprentices and opens for lunch as well. This has reduced wait times and the quality is still there. They've also opened a new location making it more accessible. I go every time I visit Phoenix.  This is not a place to go if you are hungry and in a hurry to eat. If you've got some time and enjoy a dining experience with friends, then put your name in and go next door to Bar Bianco, enjoy some drinks, appetizers, and conversation, and before you know it you'll be eating great pizza straight from the oven.",

    "text": "Please, please, please do not go here.   I know you will see all the 5 star reviews and the fancy accolades this place has received, but you deserve to know the truth. This place is terribly overrated, and I had by far the worst dining experience of my life here. I know this is long, but I hope you read it.   I guess we were an anomaly because we only had to wait about 20 minutes. The waitstaff was fine. The place oozes pretentiousness, which is off-putting, but nobody was rude.   The pizzas are fairly small and thin and cool off very quickly, but we wanted to try several of their interesting-looking pies. Our approach was to order one or two at a time so we could enjoy them hot. We selected our first one (the Margherita) and waited eagerly.   The pizza was... okay. I probably liked it best out of anyone else in my group. The crust was okay. Maybe a little bit on the bland side, but still enjoyable. I liked the sauce. It tasted fresh and bright to me. Others thought it just tasted like tomato, not like good tomato sauce. The toppings were sparse. Basil is, like, the whole point of pizza Margherita, and there were only three leaves on it. The pizza was small and disappeared very quickly between four hungry people.   We ended up ordering the Sonny Boy next. The waiter asked us if that was all we were going to order, which was kind of weird to us. We said we would probably get more, so he told us we needed to order them all then. We added another Margherita because we knew we liked it, but we were pretty annoyed.   It felt like they were just trying to get us out as fast as possible, and we all got really put off by that. Going to a highly rated restaurant with the image that it tries to put forth, one expects to be treated well and for the staff to try to provide a nice, relaxing dining experience. Their approach is weirdly at odds with their image and reputation.   We ate our 2nd and 3rd pizzas (The Sonny Boy was not my taste), and were still really hungry. The pizzas are small! We needed more food.   Here's where things go from underwhelming and annoying to fully outrageous. The waiter brought us our check without us asking for it, and we tried to order another couple of pizzas before before he went off. He looked really uncomfortable but said he would see what he could do. A few minutes later, he came back and said we could not order any more. Uh, what?   The spokesperson of our group asked to speak to the manager. A few minutes later, we see the waiter, the manager, and the hostess having a pow-wow in the corner, and we hear words drifting over to us (the place is really small). \"What should we tell them?\" \"Say... reservation... customer volume...\" They were clearly trying to think something up, invent a reason they wouldn't serve us.   So, the manager comes over and starts telling us that their policy is that the order must be made up front to maintain the flow in the kitchen and quote accurate wait times for people. Okay, maybe that is True. Why is nothing about it posted? Why didn't the waitstaff ask if we had ever dined there before and told us how it worked? That mistake is on them. They said there was a reservation. One or our group said, \"That's funny, because I called a few weeks ago about making a reservation and was told that you don't make reservations at this restaurant.\" Well, apparently they do, but only if you call at specific times a month ahead of time. So why did they just say out-right that they don't? \"So, the reservation is for this table right here. Not that table or that one. This one that we are trying to eat dinner at.\" Yep, that's right, we were told.   It was such bullshit. The attitude from the manager was appalling, treating us like we were a nuisance and like we did something wrong. He was clearly making things up on the spot to try to justify kicking us out. We paid our bill, tipped our waiter (it wasn't his fault the restaurant had a stupid policy and his manager was an asshole), and left.   We were all completely flabbergasted. Had we just been refuse service? Guess it's more important to get as many people in and out as quickly as possible than to provide a pleasant experience for their paying customers. And the snobbery was disgusting. They seem to think their mediocre pizza entitles them to treat their customers like shit just because Oprah likes it (and it's a mystery why). If accommodating a lot of people is your priority, don't set up shop in a shed! If you present yourselves the way you do, Bianco, people will rightly assume that they are going to be treated like guests and be able to enjoy their experience.   Now, they're expanding to my city, Tucson. Their pizza is only okay, and their attitude sucks. Their success is undeserved and makes me rage. Please don't support them.",

The wait to get in is ridiculous and although it is nice to be able to wait at the place next door, the food options and service are poor.

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco in my opinion is a classic living lesson in social psychology.  The sum of the elements in this restaurant (most average at best) have combined to create a reputation that far exceeds the actual product.  The menu is quite limited, even more so for lunch.  Your choices are pizza or a salad.  But be warned, the salad (at least during lunch) is simply a pile of chopped romaine lettuce with red onions.  Ah, but the pizza...  Is it a New York style, maybe a touch of Chicago style?  Big beautiful slices of pizza loaded with fresh toppings?  Not quite.  Picture Martha Stewart on a diet tasked with making a pizza only with the ingredients from her back yard.  Sure, you get this nice looking crust made right before your eyes, then a very modest sprinkinling of toppings and any sauce.  Very modest.  Essentially for $16.00 you get pizza crust with some \"wood roasted onion\", a few slivers of fennel sausage, and a hint of mozarella....just a hint mind you.  No sauce, nothing else.  The crust is fine, average, much better crust at Upper Crust or Grimaldis.  The toppings are sparce, is it how he prepares the \"wood roasted onion?\"  Why do people line up for hours for this?    Much has to do with people wanting to seem more cultured or sophisticated than they really are and Chris Bianco has really catered to this.  Small restaurant with maybe 10 tables at best, no reservations...this creates lines and people tend to believe where a line ends is \"the\" place to be.  Must make the menu seem to appeal to the sophisticated pallet...check.  Small servings at a high price...check.  Parade around the kitchen so your customers can shower you with praise for making such incredible wood roasted onions.....check.    If you find yourself in the mood to eat a big piece of over priced pizza crust with a few items from Martha Stewart's garden tossed on there, you may want to give this place a shot.  The lines are wonderful there and just being seen at this establishment will make you more hip.  Or you can save your money and time, go to the store, get a boboli crust and throw on an onion, rosemary, and pine nuts.  Voila, you have a Bianco pizza.  Add a side salad, go buy the bagged romaine and dump it on the plate, boom, Bianco salad!  Impress your neighbors with your level of sophistication when you tell them its Bianco.    Will be trying his new \"Italian Restaurant\" next, will offer a full report after.",

There are only a handful of pizzas at Bianco but you can personalize them by adding ingredients if you so choose. The Rosa... wow. Never would have thought I would like pistachios on a pizza but the crunchy texture of the nuts mixed so well with the parmesan and onions. It was unlike any pizza I have ever tasted before. Keep in mind this is a white pizza, which I prefer anyway. The crust is thin and provides a perfect stage for the ingredients. I liked this place also because everything is out in the open. You can see the pizza oven, and the two guys are making your personalized pie right there. And one of them looked just like Luigi :) There are white lights strung outside and a nice intimate atmosphere inside which added to this place's charm.",

Unfortunately, the pizza was underwhelming at best. We ordered a salad and red sauce version of Wiseguy...and maybe switching to red sauce on that pizza was our mistake. Our waiter brought the pizza before the salad arrived, and when he realized we hadn't received our salad yet he said he would go back to get our salad and THEN bring out the pizza, which is fine - no big deal, timing mishaps happen. But when the pizza came it was soggy and pretty bland. The crust on the edges, which wasn't soggy, had great flavor, but that's about it. Too bad. Been reading for years how this is one of the best pizzas in the country and it most definitely was not.

It shows the flaw in Yelp that there are actually higher rated pizza places in Phoenix, when there should be no better rated in the world.  I am from NY, traveled the world and have been to Naples, Rome, Sicily, etc.  When my flight lands in Phoenix I beeline it to Pizza Bianco.  Burnt crust, light but textured, fresh but straightforward toppings.    Now that there is no or little wait it can truly be enjoyed! Go and go quickly.  Whoever is not giving it 5 stars is simply judging it against the fact that it gets rave reviews.  And from my standpoint the rave reviews are well deserved!",

Chris Bianco has created an outpost that this food blogger couldn't leave Phoenix without trying. I first read about the place about a year ago but the acolades have been pouring in since 2002. Bianco has his flour milled just for him and uses as much locally grown/prepared ingredients as available. But again up to 2.5 hours wait? In comes Bar Bianco right next store. It is a limited bar, but the wine selections are sound and the local brews spot on. Besides what else are you going to do in the Arizona heat for that long? Cheers!!!  We hit the menu ordering Local Organic Greens and quickly on to the traditional MARGHERITA (Tomato Sauce, Basil & Mozarella), the MARINARA (no cheese - just Tomato sauce, oregano and garlic) and and 50/50 of the WISEGUY (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) and BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta & Arugula) All cooked in a Wood Fired oven. All were outstanding with the MARINARA being my favorite. Just loved the garlic flavors running through out.   We should have left and given our table to one of the many waiting to get a seat but we all needed just one more bite, so we ordered up a custom pie, with Tomato Sauce, Ricotta & Prosciutto di Parma. An unconventional mix but great flavors after the wood oven.  As we left, I happened to meet a couple from Cleveland sitting at the table next to us. We got into a quick conversation abouts great places to eat there, as I often struggle on my trips to Cleveland finding \"real\" food. B SPot and Bat Symon, here I come.",

    "text": "Undoubtedly the best pizza outside of Italy. Arizona is honored to host such a superb artisan as the master chef who owns and operates this place. If you come to Phoenix, this is the one place that truly matters to go to. The wait is ridiculous, and for any other restaurant save a hand-full (such as Ruth's Chris for instance), the wait would be intolerable. For this pizza, however, the wait makes perfect sense. I literally spent over 3 hours out of my 18th birthday waiting in line for this place (I had already been here many times before), and I honestly don't think I would've rather done anything else with that time. The pizza here has been voted the best pizza in the world by the Travel Channel, by Bon Appetit Magazine, and by (the most meaningful in my book, since it's a slap in the face to every cocky New Yorker) the New York Times. With worldwide recognition and universal praise by critics, this is a landmark in Arizona. I love this pizza, and this restaurant, every time I go there without fail. For me, the Wise-Guy pizza is the best thing in the world. They start with the best brick fired crust you can find here, in New York, or even in Italy. Then they go for some salty house smoked mozzarella (it's one of their sauce-less pizzas), add some wood roasted petals of onion, then top it off with some homemade, hand-spiced fennel sausage. Oh yeah... the pizza is that good. But, that's just my personal favorite, they have 6 pizzas to choose from with 6 extra toppings you can put on. Doesn't sound like a lot? Well.. this isn't Cici's. This is art, PB doesn't need a menu full of novelty pizzas to make it. They have a short list of perfect Italian Pies that need nothing, and leave you wanting nothing. By offering little, they offer specialized, immaculate pizza to their patient clientele.  This place is a singularity in the way-overdone pizza business. The chef and his brother have a garden where they personally grow all the herbs, spices, and some of the toppings for their pizza. This place is one of the few places on the West coast to have an old-school wood fire brick oven (they are in Heritage Square in Phoenix and are in a historic building, so it was grandfathered in). Another quirk is that every morning they make 500 balls of dough to be made into exactly 500 pizzas that night. And when they make all 500 pizzas, they close shop and go home. They even slightly change their dough recipe for humidity and by season to help insure the perfect product, every time you go there. It's all of these small little touches that make this particular pizza joint stand out from all the rest. There are so many things to say about this place. I love everything, from the very best french bread I've ever had that they serve with olive oil and vinegar, to their minimalist, ultra-classic spin on a salad, even to the great bar next door for the adults in your group while you wait. This restaurant truly is the pride of the Valley of the Sun. If you come to visit, you didn't really see Phoenix if you didn't go to Pizzeria Bianco. Period.",

I was super surprised no one was waiting outside and decided rather then to wait hours later to steal a seat with my husband and have a nice little lunch.  We ordered the Rosa Pizza and shared. It was yummy, and the perfect size for two people.  The pizza is handmade and put into the wood oven located within viewing distance right in front of you.  I guess I'm not that big of a crust person but being near the fire of course it was a little burnt, but that didn't bother me.   We sat at the bar so not to have to wait and got in and out of the restaurant super fast.",

    "text": "THE BEST RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX. one of the few reasons to eat out in phoenix really.  So what you have to wait to eat here. It is well worth the wait. Bring a book, get here at three, enjoy a glass of wine at four when the bar opens next door, and enjoy your meal when you get in at five when the restaurant opens. If you are too hungry, you can always get a bar snack at the bar Chris owns next door. all the choices are great. wonderful olives and yummy cheeses.  Anyhow, the restaurant is worth waiting to eat at. My brother and I wait the two or more hours a couple times a month if possible. We drive from over an hour and a half away to eat here. Although I must admit we have sandwiches at Pane Bianco for lunch, grocery shop, then come here for dinner.  ALL the pizzas are amazing. Although my favorites by far are the margherita- his homemade fresh mozzarella is to die for and the tomato sauce is amazing- and the bianco verde. love them both. and leftovers are a great welcome the next day when im back in the shitty little town i live in.  The antipasto appetizer is amazing as well. cant eat dinner here and not get that to start off with. the vegetables change every time I go. whatever is fresh at the farmers market they roast that day. then they add yummy cheese and meat and olives. mmmmm... im drooling thinking about it. my favorite is when they have jerusalem artichokes. wow. amazingly delicious! and there is a market salad that changes regularly as well. nice and refreshing.  What can I say. I love this place! never been let down. Although I am sad Chris doesnt make the pizzas anymore, I understand why he doesnt and am very happy he has a replacement to make them instead. mmmmm... thank you Chris for such great food!",

Of course if you don't want to wait you could just take five of your closest friends and make a reservation. Reservations for parties of 6 or more are welcome. However, if any member of your party is late consider your reservation None and void. Don't blame them - there are others outside that have been waiting hours for a table.   But seriously worth the wait. Chris Bianco tosses all the crusts himself! The ingredients are always fresh! It's best to go with a group so that you can order multiple pies and try them all. I'm also a very big fan of their grilled veggie appetizer - it's marinated to perfection!  Don't let the wait scare you off! The adjacent wine bar has great prices and it's a nice wait splitting a bottle of wine on a picnic table outside!",

    "text": "One of the best pizzas I had.  Considering how I am a pizza snob when it comes to pizza outside of NYC, that alone says how much Pizzeria Bianco delivers.  One thing that I enjoyed was the unique toppings for the pizzas.  When first hearing it, pistachios doesn't sound too appetizing on a pizza.  But I assure you, the flavor combinations are great.  Highly recommend the margherita pizza.  Surprisingly, basil works really well on pizza.  The crust is what takes the cake for Pizzeria Bianco. It must be the wood-fire ovens they use.  The crust is crisp and light.  Blends perfectly well with the ingredients.  On top of that , the pizzas aren't too expensive and the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant adds to the experience.  Overall, if you're in Phoenix, you should stop by Pizzeria Bianco.  I hear that it is a 3hr wait.  But it only took me 20 minutes to get a table, so don't get intimated by the wait time.",

    "text": "Visited based on all raving reviews, and because the owner is supposed to be from phill (where we work) with several friends on our escape weekend. Had a borderline unreasonably long wait time as reservations are not accepted, however they sent us next door to a wine/beer and cheese bar type place, so that killed time pretty well.  My one friend ordered a basic white, and they were out. Not a good sign. We got seated, outside, which is lovely, and the table is so uneven my beer falls over. That sucked but I wasn't a fan of it anyways (nut brown ale, which I usually like, but I'm not faulting anyone for my tastebud preference). The selection of pizzas consist of 3 red sauce and 3 white, that's it. Ok. I can deal with that, because at the bottom of the menu  also has a selection of \"additions.\" I figure I can make my masterpiece. I try to request the addition of a red sauce to the white pizza and you would have thought I was asking the server to kill her first born child. No exception was made. I wanted to have a side of sauce and the explanation was \"the chef policy.\"  Forgive me, but who on earth can dictate what I think will taste better?  I offered to pay for the added sauce but still, no dice. I went ahead and ordered, and got a pizza that was absolutely covered in onions (which, were good in a much smaller quantity, but I guess I'm crazy if I prefer pizza w onions vs onions w pizza. ) The rest of the table tried 4 other types of pizza, none of them were finished. We were all very disappointed.  We are not going to recommend nor return.",

Their wood-fired pizzas are really good - you get the burnt bubbles on the crust - the crust is light - almost like putting cotton candy in your mouth, but in a good crusty kind of way. The tomato sauce is fresh and delicious.  What happens when it's a bad tomato season? Make the caprese salad with grilled peppers instead! Thank you for continuing to give me the required direct injection of fresh mozzarella that I crave. It's delicious.  The pastas - fresh pasta with amazing sauces. The bolognese might actually be as good as mine (that's a high bar to reach :) ), and the tomato sauce is always better - he must import the good tomatoes.  Wine - great selections, good prices.   And I'd like to drink the olive oil out of a glass.  I have never had a bad experience or bad meal at either if the locations.",

The good part now is that they are open for lunch, so the line isn't quite as long and they take RESERVATIONS! I made a res for 10 about 3 weeks out, and while it was very crowded in there with 10 people, it was well worth it. The setting is adorable; Heritage Square, to me, is perfect downtown Phoenix. The old house is super cute, as is the bar next door. Bonus points because you can walk to the ballpark and other downtown sites. The menu and wine/beer lists are small, but carefully-selected and unique. The pizza has an excellent crust with delicious, local-where-possible ingredients. I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for visitors and locals!",

    "text": "My first visit to Pizzeria Bianco was about 6 years ago.  We waited for just over 2 hours and got a pizza that, in my opinion, was totally burned.  Fast forward to last week.... my son and I were visiting the Arizona Science Center that morning and we were hungry.  Friends had been telling me for years that I was cRAzY for not loving Pizzaria Bianco so I thought, what the hell.  They're open for lunch now, it's just a 5 min wait, so lets give it a whirl.  My son was demanding pepperoni pizza (which I already knew they didn't have) so I ordered the Sonny Boy with sopressata, figuring he wouldn't know the difference.  I also had a glass of wine, and I was a little disappointed at the limited selection of wines by the glass, considering they had a wine bar next door.  The pizza, thankfully, was much better this time.  It still had the charring around the edges, which I understand is their thing, but it wasn't burned.  In fact, I think the bottom could have been cooked a little more.  The middle of the pizza was quite droopy, and not stiff enough to hold up the toppings that kept sliding off.  The sopressata was a fantastic salty treat and the olives were very flavorful.  My son loved it, too and we polished off the whole pizza in record time.  With the much improved pie, the food portion of our visit deserved 4 stars, but what brought my rating down was our server.  I'm not even totally sure she was our server to be honest.  She took our drink order, brought one of our drinks, and asked us if we needed anything else toward the end of our meal - but that was it.  Someone else took our pie order, refilled water, brought my wine, dropped off our lunch, and brought the bill.  Our server was MIA for 90% of the meal and I don't think she ever smiled once.  I'm cool with people who are all business - in the business world!  But if I'm at your restaurant, you should make some attempt to be welcoming and helpful.  If I were downtown, I would certainly lunch at Pizzeria Bianco again, but I wouldn't drive out from the East Valley just for this.  I know of several other places with great pizza that are closer to me, and who seem to care a little more about their customers' happiness.",

A number of people I know and respect recommended Bianco.  Plus it had been written up as one of the great pizza joints in the west.  So I went with an open mind when attended the Phoenix Film Festival in March.  Wow!  Was I completely disappointed. I tried two pies: the Margherita and the pistachio pie, which came highly recommended.  I would rank them about a 3 on scale of 10.  The sauce on the Margherita was bland and unexciting.  The cheese honestly tasted stale.  And the crust was like a bad imitation of typical NYC pizza.  Except dry and uninviting.  It was dry yet undercooked.  Go figure.  While the pistachio pie had an interesting flavor, the crust once again destroyed any pleasure I could get from the meal.  I was there with a friend from LA who felt that even by LA's miserable pizza standards, Bianco was a cut below.   Service was nothing special.  The atmosphere was fine, but who cares if the food is so damn bland.  Truly disappointed on every level. Pizzeria Bianco cannot even stand in the shadows of New Haven's holy trinity.  Perhaps the owners should take a visit to New Haven to learn what pizza should taste like.",

Although they were packed at 8:30pm, with a 20 minute wait at the time, we were able to snag two seats at the bar. It is a small but fun place with the only kind of pizza oven one should see, the brick beehive oven with real wood inside.  The smells were great and although the menu is simple it is very inviting. We chose the 4 cheese and arugala pizza and enjoyed a Cider while we waited. The cider was crisp and sweet and refreshing.  The pizza arrived quickly and was cooked perfectly. The dough was crisp on the bottom but had the right bite and chew. The blend of cheeses were delicious, a perfect bland making for an amazing taste. The peppery arugula on the top of the perfect compliment to the reach complex cheese flavors.  Basically the wait is worth it, good service, and excellent pizza that is as good as people say it is. Location is unique but worth finding.",

    "text": "Here's the thing about Pizzeria Bianco, it's very good. If there was no wait (I mean, you can go during off hours, sure) it'd be fantastic. Realistically, you need to plan on including the wait as part of your weekend dinner outing. If you're in a rush, move along. If you're looking for an 'experience', PB will do you right.   The pizzas are all excellent and I've never had a bad item, dirty plate, or subpar service here. The place is fantastic. The only knock against the name is that it was watered down by lowering itself to a location in Tucson -- but the REAL Pizzeria Bianco, the original, on Adams is as timeless a dining experience as there has ever been.",

    "text": "I WISH I had taken pictures of my meal so I could recreate my dining experience. This place wrapped me up in a blanket for the senses. Visually, its rustic with exposed brick and floor to ceiling windows in the front. The building looks like it was a converted space from decades ago, but I didn't get the story to confirm.  Enjoy the show from any seat in this place as you watch pizza being made and pulled in and out of their giant pizza oven. The hustle and bustle is so energizing and when it's dark out, it feels very intimidate and local.  If you get there early and you're Table isn't ready, you have the option to go next door to their sister bar/restaurant for drinks. You will be notified when you can be seated. The pizza is insane: crisp and packed with flavor, especially the dough. Even the olive oil that you dip your bread in is rich and flavorful. I feel like this place would be well suited in NY or NJ but was delighted to have it in AZ - it really is THAT good.",

    "text": "Aha! We finally actually got to eat pizza this time! The past few times we've been in the area and have stopped by here, it's been an hour or more wait, and I'm just too impatient to do so. Even the place next door for waiting gets too crowded as well!  This time, we planned it well... after getting breakfast at Gallo Blanco, we figured... hey, we're in the area, why not get some pizzas to go. Yeah, I know... I know... they don't do pizzas to go unless you eat there, so, as gluttinous as it sounds. We ate pizza right after breakfast!  We did it right this time. We arrived around 10am this lovely humid Saturday morning. No one was in their parking lot. Uh-oh, our timing was too good. We wandered off to the Arizona Science Center to chill (literally it was freezing in there) and then came back around 10:40am, and still no people waiting out front. The first family came around 10:45 and at the same time Bianco's brought the valet stand out. A few minutes later, more and more people came pulling up. So, 10am's too early. I'd say about 10:39am would be just right to park, sit in the air conditioning for awhile and then stroll up to the door at 10:48 and then even though there's a short line, you'll still get a table!  We ate the Margherita (tomato sauce and cheese was wholesome and good. Very light on the basil this time) and the Wise Guy (sausage was excellent on this one) pizzas there. They're about 12\" size pizzas which are good for individual pizzas especially since the crust isn't exactly thick. Everything is really light... the crust, the toppings, the sauce. No feeling of oiliness at the end, because everything is \"just right.\"  We ate the Rosa and Sonny Boy at home. The Rosa is very unique and delicious because it has both Rosemary potatoes and pistachios on it. I loved this one and am still crushing on it! The Sonny Boy is definitely for the olive lovers, because the olive taste is so strong! All pizzas had the fresh, light, brick oven taste. Is it the best pizza in the country as legend has it? Although I did love these pizzas, I can't reach a verdict because it's different. I don't know what to compare it to. La Piazza Al Forno was still this same type of thin gourmet pizza, yet the Al Forno cheeses were just so oily and rich and filling. Amaro Pizzeria and Vino Lounge has pizzas that also reminded me of Pizzeria Bianco's. All I know is... I loved Pizzeria Bianco and I would wait about 30 mins for it, but definitely not over an hour for it. And once I do get in again, I'm going to take home a bunch of pizzas again!",

Anyways, with the boyfriend and they sat us in the back where there are three SMALL tables for two ppl each. Of course, we get sat right in the middle. I ask the waitress politely if we could have that regular table and she gave me the \"resting bitch face\" and said um we like to save that for a party of 4. Didnt feel like arguing so just sucked it up.   Food was pretty good. Got two pizzas. Expensive though!!! $15 for a smaller size cheese pizza? Ummm  Grimaldis is so much better",

The Margarita was so good that taste remained for a next few hours, Rosa was also surprisingly good and I did like the idea of pistas as toppings for the Rosa. Highly recommended, will come back again with more friends.",

    "text": "The hype train is strong for Bianco.  Saying that, it is always hard to live up.  Located in a very cute square, Bianco shares a side with their sister Bar Bianco.  The cool part is that you can order from the Bar while dining at Bianco if thye have a drink that Pizzeria does not.  The wait for use was a reasonable 30 minutes, better than expected, and a perfect amount of time to grab a drink and sit in the waiting picnic table area.  Bianco is dog-friendly, always a plus, and seemed very kid-friendly as well.  We ordered the caprese salad and half half pizza of margharita and wise guy with some added mushroom.  The caprese was fresh with fantastic oil.  But just so much cheese.  And it seemed very lazy that the tomato still hadthe stem on it on our plate.  I get that it may look artistic, but I'd rather enjoy my meal instead of worrying if I'm gonna get vines stuck in my teeth.  The pizza crust was perhaps the best I've ever had.  The pizza itself was a mix between your new age craft pizza and New York style.  The cheese still oozed, but the crust was charred.  The wise guy was fantastic while the margharita was your classic pizza, but a little boring.  The mushrooms are fantastic and well worth the $3 upcharge.  Service all around was great.  Heat lamps make sitting outside perfect for any weather.  The restaurant was very cozy with that renovated house feel.  A plus in favor of Bianco, though no reservations are taken, is their system that tracks how long people have waited so you can time coming back to the restaurant if you want to take a stroll to a neighboring bar or around the district.  Bianco is well worth the trip to find fantastic pizza in Phoenix.  You can get in and out easily under $35 a person with drinks, which is always a fantastic selling point for top quality food.",

Rude rude rude. Well you know what karma comes around.  Restaurant review: Friendly servers except for not so friendly hostess who are seating people, no smile no welcome just how many people, this is tonight at 6pm. She looked like she didn't want to work that night. The guy with long black hair and beard that served us and the  brunette server were really nice and friendly.

The atmosphere is wonderful, the service staff treat you like family and they are always busy. The Pizza IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE the best pizza and the world. The crust has an amazing crunch/chew to it, while the sauce is just exploding with flavor. Our favorite pizza is the traditional Margherita but we also love Sonny Boy and the wise guy.   We love Chris Bianco's book and we buy the exact tomatoes he uses in his restaurant for his pizza sauce. I still have yet to perfect the crust recipe but I will continue to try.   This place holds the best memories for us, from our first date to our first outing with our babies. Cheers to so many more years of wonderful service and amazing food.",

I know there are people that like big pizzas with thicker crust and lots of sauce, cheese and toppings. Bianco not for you. If you want one of the best crusts on the planet you have come to the right place.  The Rosa pizza with AZ pistachios, Parmesan Cheese, Rosemary, Red Onions is out of this world.    Wait staff are knowledgeable and efficient.    I'll be back.",

I have heard the stories about the crowds but at 2pm on a weekday we were able to sit immediately.  There is no better test for a pizzeria than the Margarita.  Ours came quickly with blisters from the screaming hot oven.  Lightly dressed with sauce and mozzarella and fresh basil tossed on after baking.  I found the crust a bit too cracker like but still a fine pizza. Had dessert as well and I must say the flourless chocolate cake was amazingly great!",

A coworker of mine chose this restaurant while we were on a business trip in Arizona so I really had no expectations other than, \"if she chose then it must be good\".   Boy was I surprised just how good it was. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm smile and then immediately led to the best table in the house (which imho is the corner spot to the far back right). The tables were all wooden tables and the decorum was super hampton's-esque.   I ordered the classic that is the margarita pizza but made it my own by adding Sicilian anchovies.. Mmm. I'm known to be a pretty hungry fella sometimes so between this decently sized personal pizza, and filling up on some bread dipped in olive oil to start, I was pretty full.   Like I said, I'm a New Yorker so you better believe I folded my pizza in half when I ate it. I was the first at my table to be completely finished and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Scottsdale.   Spark notes: Great service, warm friendly server, laid back summery vibe and delicious food\"",

Because if I lived here, this would be my spot!     ---   ---   ---  I visited during a work trip where we had a giant table of about 20 people in the middle of the restaurant. It was hectic, loud and stimulating, because most of us don't get to see each other often, so there was much catching-up to do.  But I was focused.  Rewind to about 4 hours earlier in the day when I was unpacking my suitcase in my room. I was listening to Conan O'Brien's podcast with Jimmy Kimmel as the guest. They were talking about how into food Jimmy has gotten and how's even installed a pizza oven in his home. He mentioned his \"pizza guy\" was this guru named Chris Bianco who has a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona and he's won a bunch of awards.  *Record scratch*  Here I am, in Phoenix. And on our agenda for the evening is dinner at Pizzeria Bianco. Destiny is alive and well!  After hearing that podcast, I skipped past everything else on the menu and went straight for the pizza. I ordered a margherita and added prosciutto for $6.  This pizza was excellent in every way. I easily housed every bite of it and could have eaten more. My favorite part is that they do not sprinkle on a couple dustings of prosciutto - this pizza was caked in it. That was a nice change from other places where you don't even have some meat on every slice.   When I was told that one of the flavors of Italian Ice was nutmeg, I obviously had to get it. And let me tell you, it was the absolute perfect way to end the evening. I wish I could purchase a gallon of that ice and take it home. The flavor, the texture... it was what dreams are made of.  Our service was 10-stars out of 5. Despite our large/loud group our glasses were never empty and we never felt neglected. There was mostly only one person working the end of the table I was on and he did an outstanding job. I wish I would have gotten his name, but he deserves a raise :)  Pizzeria Bianco, you did not disappoint!",

They are very well flavored and cooked to a point they are soft but with textures. The pizza is good. I don't like the free bread (and the olive oil) at all.

I loved being here.  The decor was industrial and inviting.  The Montepulciano wine was lovely.  Smooth, full bodies with a subtle, dry, velvety finish. The pizza...oh the pizza.  It was a work of art.  Beautifully simple and perfected.  Quality, simple ingredients.  It was overdone or overdressed.  It was pizza.  The dough was light, airy with a perfect chew.  It wasn't too charred.  I had half Margarita/half Wise guy.  The Margarita had a wonderful red sauce, fresh mozzarella and super fresh basil.  The sauce was incredible.  I could have a bowl of just that!  The wise guy had a delicious fennel sausage.  It wasn't greasy.  The smoked mozzarella was delicious and the perfect combo.  The onions were wood fired but not overly caramelized.  I was happy they weren't too sweet.   The dessert was divine.  I was able to try all three and I can't choose a favorite.  The rice pudding was delicious, rich and creamy, served cold.  The chocolate cake was fudgey and very good.  The biscotti was light and had great flavor.   My favorite place in AZ thus far.  It was a rough day but when I walked into this place, it was my favorite day!  Thank you!!!  Finally something I don't feel compelled to make better myself!",

The restaurant is very small so we were asked to wait outside or at the associated bar next door. Our wait was close to three hours! We triple checked to make sure they didn't skip us and they assured us they would call us soon. We ordered a pizza with sausage but the sausage was sliced very thick and was four times thicker than the crust so it was very difficult to eat. The proportion didn't work for me and the flavors weren't anything great that I couldn't get from Sauce (fast-food, upscale pizza).",

If you wait for anything for over 2hrs, you are starving by then, and it tastes incredible no matter what it is! Honestly though, the pistachio pizza is so unique, and equally delicious. And once inside, the chef/owner (?) made a stop over, was very professional and appreciative of our business, and it shows in the rest of the staff. It's not quite Italy, but then again, what is? Given the choice though, I would go to Federal Pizza over this one. More selections, better crust.",

After living in NYC, this place just can't and doesn't measure up.  Clearly, the people who are rating this place haven't had really good pizza and dont' have many options in this small town....

    "text": "This place is certainly delicious, worth the wait on a special occasion (translation - not a place you frequent since the lines are so long) but \"Best Pizza in America?\" I think that title belongs to Di Fara's in NYC... but let's get to my review of Pizzeria Bianco.  We arrived nearly two hours before opening to find a line of 25 people and patiently waited for the restaurant to open. Around 4:30 p.m., Frank the owner came outside to tell everyone about the ingredients that are used, how the brick oven works and to thank everyone for their patience and patronage - he really is an awesome guy!  Once we got in the place (total wait time was 3.5 hours) we ordered: - Anti-pasta - Margherita  - Wise Guy - Bianca Verde - Rosa   The anti-pasta was delicious but my favorite part was the bread that came with olive oil - this bread was seriously addicting! It was doughy, crisp and had a wonderful charred flavor (in a good way, not a bad way).  The margherita pizza was good but not my favorite, in fact, it tasted better room temperature.  The wise guy had carmelized onions and their own blend of fennel sausage. This pizza was tasty as well, but again, not my favorite and tasted much better when it was room temperature vs. straight from the oven.  The two pizzas that were mind-blowingly delicious were the Bianca Verde and the Rosa. The verde had no sauce, mozzeralla and ricotta cheeses and was topped with arugala and drizzled with delicious olive oil. The combination was absolutely delicious! The pizza was creamy and wonderfully delicious!  The Rosa was equally amazing - a pizza with no sauce or cheese, instead incredibly delicious parmesan cheese covered the pizza and was topped with pistachios and onions! OMG, it isn't fair that something is this delicious!  I'll definitely come back to this place - primarily because I don't live in Arizona so it's a special treat - but next time I'd just stick with the Verde and Rosa pizzas, these truly are incredible!",

The parmigiano is way too overwhelming (unless you're into that...then by all means). The Wise Guy is alright but a little too greasy for my tastes. The margherita is solid and my friends rave about the sonny boy (I don't like olives).  But my goodness that biancoverde. That's the one I think about when someone mentions Bianco and the one I go back for every time. The fresh arugula pairs so well with the cheeses and it's so well balanced. You can tell the ingredients are top notch and the crust is just icing on the cake. It is simply incredible.  On the flip side, I would avoid coming here around noon and dinner time since the wait times are outrageous around then. Personally I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour for. Is the pizza good? Absolutely. Is it life-changing? No. As many have noted, it's just pizza.  Still, it's worth planning ahead for and trying out. You won't be disappointed.",

Good thing because this place is so over hyped we thought we'd be in for an hour wait. Doors opened right at 11a and we were seated right away. Litle rushed to order but if you are here you should already know what you want because you have researched it over and over dreaming of the day you go.   I'm going 4 stars not because of the pizza(3stars) but because i was transported back in time to when i was 10 growing up in(movie Sideways was filmed here)  Santa Ynez, Ca. When I was a kid, an older couple moved to the Valley from Rome and opened up a small pizzeria called The Roman Kitchen. The smell of Bianco reminded me of the old wood/brick oven they would fire everything in. To this day by far the best pizza I've ever had R.I.P. Roman Kitchen.  Overall the pizza was good pushing towards great. But not worth a hour wait. Then again I do not feel any food is worth that wait. Will I be back? Yes, only for lunch, for I do not care to stand around for hours for some pizza.   I do thank you for the flash back in time.",

Without knowing anything, I started reading these crazy yelp reviews about waiting in line for 4-5 hours.  I thought to myself, \"Are these people crazy?!?!  It's just a damn pizza!\"  Then I start reading... the #1 pizza in the country... Oprah ranks it her #2... and then I realized that I have nothing better to do while in Phoenix so what the heck.  A friend tells me it's not that bad on weekdays so I head on out to wait in line at 4:30pm on a Tuesday, 30 minutes before the place even opens.  It's 109 degrees out and there are already a bunch of people waiting in line!  After checking in, I easily have more than enough time to head back to the hotel to pickup the wife.  Two hours later, my life is changed.  I cannot give another pizza joint 5 stars ever again.  Pizzeria Bianco doesn't have the pizza's that I'm used to, it's just on another level.  If you're expecting a really good Round Table slice, it's absolutely nothing like that.  The toppings were just so fresh and flavorful with just the perfect amount of saltiness from the olives.  We had the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy, both very different pizzas but equally amazing in their own right.  It's very possible that I gave this pizzeria 5 stars because I was just starved for 2 hours before eating and probably anything would have tasted good, but I think I really tried to be extra critical because of all of the hype.  Conclusion.  Best pizza I've ever had, but I still think people are insane to wait over 2 hours for this place (let alone ANY place).  Go on a weekday!",

    "text": "Is Pizzeria Bianco really the greatest pizza I've ever had?  I'm not quite ready to go that far.  But does Pizzeria Bianco serve up incredible pizza that lives up to its hype?  Oh, dear God, yes it does.  We had the margherita pizza (this one at least may have been the best version of this classic that I have I've ever had) and the biancoverde (an amazing white pizza).  Simple.  Fresh.  Delicious.  Those are the three perfect words to describe Pizzeria Bianco.  The menu is small but everything looks tasty.  The ingredients are the definition of fresh.  The tomato sauce on the margherita tastes like it was cooked just before going into the wood fire oven.  I'd believe you if you told me the basil was picked when I ordered the pie.  I can say the same about the biancoverde.  The cow that provided the ricotta could've been milked that morning. The augural and rosemary, were also ridiculously fresh.  The prices may seem a touch high, but the quality of the food is worth every penny.   If I'm going to overindulge something so high in carbs and calories, I might as well know that it's not all processed junk.  The two pizzas were more than enough food for two people; but I won't lie, if there was a third pie, I would have happily consumed that one as well.  Everyone's top criticism of Pizzeria Bianco is the wait.  All I have to say about waiting hours for a pizza is this; You know what you're getting into before you enter the door.  Pizzeria Bianco isn't a place that most people stumble into on a whim.  It has a well deserved reputation, it's small, and you're most likely aware that there is a good possibility that you're dining experience is going to be two to three hours or more.  My fiance and arrived early on Saturday afternoon (4:30) expecting an hour wait.  We were told it would be about an 1:10 and we went next door to get a drink and wait.  To our surprise, in only about 15 minutes, a pair of seats at the bar opened up.  Lucky us.  Pizzeria Bianco is also now open for lunch.  From what I hear (and have just experienced) it is a lot easier to get in than it used to be.  You know you've been wanting to try it for a while.  Go ahead and do it already!",

Although my family generally despises waiting for a table at a restaurant (any wait time over 20 minutes usually means we look for a different restaurant), I managed to persuade them to wait at Pizzeria Bianco because, well, we had come all the way from New Jersey and would probably not be coming back to Phoenix anytime soon. Of course, since we were in Phoenix on a Friday evening in mid-June, there was a pretty long line and wait time even when we arrived at 9 pm. We didn't get seated until nearly 11 pm, making for the longest wait my family had ever endured for a table at a restaurant.   Based on the reviews I had read, I decided to order one each of the Rosa (Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Onion, Arizona Pistachios), Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives), and Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) to share between four people. First off, let me say that the crust on all of the pizzas we shared was absolutely phenomenal. There was a really nice char on the crust, and somehow, the crisp crust maintained a level of pliancy which I did not think was possible. This was my first experience with Neapolitan-style pizza, so unfortunately, my experience here at Pizzeria Bianco may have set the bar exceedingly high for my future visits to Neapolitan-style pizzerias. While I generally favor meat toppings, I was astounded to discover that the Rosa was my favorite pie among the three we had ordered. Everything about the pie - the sharp bite of the Parmigiano Reggiano, the sweetness of the red onion, and the crunch and nuttiness of the pistachios - worked harmoniously to create a pizza that was greater than the sum of its parts. I was absolutely blown away by how delicious this pie was, and I wish I had ordered another Rosa for myself. I thought the Wiseguy was extremely good as well. The combination of sausage, onion, and mozzarella made for a more conventional flavor profile, though it was by no means ordinary. As for the Sonny Boy, I thought it was quite salty; of the three pies, I thought this one was the least successful, as the salt content from the salami and olives seemed to overwhelm the pie.  So do I think that Pizzeria Bianco serves up the greatest pizza in the country? I really don't know, as I certainly have not eaten at many of the nation's top pizzerias. However, I will say that the pizzas from Pizzeria Bianco are delicious and are most definitely worthy of all of the praise and acclaim showered upon them. Despite the ridiculous wait time, I believe that Pizzeria Bianco's pizzas are worth waiting for (well, I'd wait up to 2 hours; I doubt that there's any food that I'd wait 4 hours for, regardless of how good it may be). If you are ever in the Phoenix area, definitely make a point of stopping by to try it for yourself.",

    "text": "I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...  Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)  Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)  After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?  Creating the \"Pizza Placebo Effect\"?  I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)  So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?     Other people, that's why:)  Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(  We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...  Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?  Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?  Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(  For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the \"you're barely worthy of eating here\" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.  I understand that all the kids \"assisting Chris\" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?  It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?  I can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)  And speaking of \"appreciated\"...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(  The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us \"the rules of PB\" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(  You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.  But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about \"customer service\" and being the \"the best possible pizza experience for each customer\"...the attitude of \"we're PB and you're not\" is pervasive and unpleasant:(  And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or \"regulars\" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.  But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)",

    "text": "Decided to stop by on our way to the Grand Canyon when on our drive there I remembered my friend telling me 5+ years ago that the best pizza in the US was in Phoenix.  I don't know why I remembered that... maybe because this particular friend used to bug the crap out of me everyday asking me to go on a road trip specifically to eat this infamous pizza.  Or maybe I'm a genius that remembers everything anyone's ever told me.  We came here for lunch and waited about 10 minutes.  Whew, lucked out.  The pizzas looked pretty big so we ordered one pizza --- Wiseguy --- and the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  The waiter also made it a point to tell us that the Wiseguy  did not use a tomato based sauce.  Odd but we nodded and said that was fine.  The salad was great... but then again, how can you eff up a mozzarella, tomato and basil salad?  The pizza was also good but pretty underwhelming after all I'd heard about this place.  Then we started wondering if the greatness of Pizzeria Bianco was the tomato sauce especially since the waiter mentioned that the Wiseguy didn't use it.  We flagged down our waiter and asked if we could have some of the tomato sauce on the side.  Denied!  He said they didn't do that and that that was the reason he mentioned the 'no tomato sauce in the Wiseguy' in the first place.  I don't want to get technical here but HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?!?  I mean, no biggie (but not really since I did ALL CAPS my complaint) and again, the food was good.  Just not 'let's drive for 8 hours from LA to have a bite of the awesomeness that is the Pizzeria Bianco pizza' good.",

I've also heard how many people wait hours just to eat here so my boyfriend and I tried going on a weekday for lunch.   There was a 30 minute wait which wasn't too bad. The service was fine but I didn't necessarily like the setup of the restaurant. I'm fine with smaller restaurants with lots of charm but our table was so close to the tables next to us it made it hard not to feel like we were sitting on top of the couple next to us.   But we came for the pizza and while it was good pizza, it is not something I would ever wait HOURS for like other reviewers mentioned! I guess after hearing  time after time that this is THE best pizza I had certain expectations and was sadly disappointed! It is worth checking out, but definitely check out a few other local places to compare.  To sum it up: good pizza, but not mindblowingly, wait for 3 hours good! I think there's a few other really great local urban pizzerias in Phoenix that I will go to over Bianco.",

All of the ingredients were the best quality, the crust was thin yet soft, and the bread was awesome. I ended up trying four different pizzas and all were amazing. The wait is bearable if you drink at the bar next door or the English pub across from it. You can call at intervals to check back for the approximate wait time, so you can venture out pretty much anywhere in the area while you wait. Just make sure to get there a 1/2 hour before you get called in. And make sure you go with people you enjoy hanging out with for more than a short while!",

Before I get into the pizza I have to say the staff was superb and very friendly. Including the lovely bartender at the bar next door-surprisingly no one was in a bad mood about waiting. The environment was so welcoming I didn't want to leave so I'll definitely return. Sometimes I like to consider myself a pizzaficionado and the pizza here was not disappointing one bit. I selected the Wiseguy for my first pie and boy ole boy was this love at first sight. I've never seen a pizza deck with onion filled with so much flavor. The sausage was so moist and blended well with the everything. The crust was so robust smoke seem to pour from my nose with each bite. Being a southerner and an avid griller I can appreciate the smoke taste within a dish. Let me tell you eating this pizza was like watching a suspense thriller with a dramatic ending hoping for a sequel... then there's another slice to relive the moment all over again ahhh :0",

With Bar Bianco next door, they really have a good setup. We ordered apps, which were excellent-- spiedini with prosciutto and fontina and a fresh tomato mozzarella salad. We had the margherita and sonny boy pizzas- both excellent! They have a limited menu, which I think can be pulled off only by a place that does everything on its menu well.

IMHO they should be handing out complimentary antipasti like salumi in seattle and apologizing for the unusually long wait.  but they don't have to, because pheonicians enjoy getting treated like dog crap i guess.  i'll be one person that won't ever go there again.",

This if anything should have given the pizza an advantage. Everything looked right: the vibe, brick oven, and service all suggested a great meal. We ordered the wiseguy, margherita, and biancoverde. Sitting there watching the pizza maker, I was wondering why he would never clear the ash from the oven. Now I only noticed this b/c I had been seated in front of the oven at pizzeria mozza a couple of weeks ago and had seen them clear the oven every 15-20 minutes of the ash. Oh well, I assumed they knew better than me. After the first bite, all I could taste was ash. Ash and more ash just pervaded the slice. Don't get me wrong I love the taste of char my pizzas. But this was different; this was nasty burnt cigarette remains in each and every bite. And it was the same for all three pizzas. But this wasn't the only problem with the pie. The most important part of a pizza for me is the crust. But Bianco's crust was just not that interesting, neither in texture nor flavor. The center of the crust was limp and soggy after 5 minutes. The toppings were also subpar and unbalanced: Fennel sausage lacked the punch that I'm accustomed to from homemade sausage. The margherita had too little basil, while the biancoverde had way too much argula to the point where the bitterness overwhelmed all the ricotta and other cheeses. Without the ash issue, I could see this being decent pizza, but definitely not deserving of a journey or a 4 hour wait. This pizza is not in the realm of Nancy Silverton's pie at Mozza nor in the universe of Dom's pizza at Di Fara's.",

My friends arrived later and were kind enough to run and get me a glass of wine.  5pm came and excitement buzzed in the air!  Would we make the first cut?  I couldn't see why not, but just then several large parties arrived and went in first...due to the reservations allowed for 6+ rule.  The line started moving and sure enough, the cut-off was right in front of me.  We'd have to wait.   My friends were irritated, even though I'd done the longest wait, but I dug in my heels and said \"I'm staying, you guys can go elsewhere if you like\".  They stuck with me and we went to the other building for an hour or so.  We had a cheese plate and more wine in the meantime.  Our number was up and we were stuffed into the last table at the back of the room.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share.  They were good but being so thin, not very filling and the dessert selection of tira misu wasn't very exciting.  We got the impression they didn't care much if we were satisfied, just wanted to keep the line outside moving, so I left still a little hungry.    Added annoyance was I forgot to have my parking stub stamped and had to pay the entire fee when I left.  So not a great experience I'd say.   It would be really nice to go there and walk in like a normal guest, not in a herd, and enjoy my first glass of wine WITH my pizza.   Maybe it's better now that it's open during the day?",

    "text": "So, after hearing from colleagues that this is often cited as the best pizza in the country, I decided to go to Pizzeria Bianco last week. We made reservations, since I wasn't sure if a pizza could justify a three-hour wait. Our reservation was pretty early in the evening, and thus when we got there, there were no lines. I ordered the Margarita; I wanted to leave the more exotic toppings for the next time (if there is ever going to be one!). To be honest, the pizza was pretty good, but definitely nowhere near the best I have ever had. It reminded me of the pizzas I had in Italy, so you could say that it is very authentic. To me, the cost (for the size of the pizza) and the hype doesn't justify what is served. I probably would not go back, unless someone was treating me. I have heard many say that Grimaldi's is actually better than Bianco, so it's onto try that next. If that too doesn't work out, I would rather make homemade pizzas myself. :)",

Bianco's pizza is clearly the best pizza anywhere. But the arrogance at Bianco's is now so over the top it disgusts us . Went there on Friday and the crabby hostess told us it was a 5 hour wait. Given it was almost 8pm and Bianco's is only for a few more hours, we were floored with her rudeness- she just could not care a less and she expressed verbally and in her body language. A simple, sincere \"we are full for the night\" was all that was necessary. This is now 3 or 4 occasions that we have been treated like crap by a hostess at Bianco's. We've always tolerated it, but the rudeness is so out of control we felt we needed to convey it to others. We will write to the SF Chronicle, NY Times, Zagat's and other food periodicals to share our view. We blame Chris for tolerating this arrogance and customer service by his staff. It's so sad to see someone at the top take the customers that have helped to some degree shap.e the experience/product and figuratively tell them to go to h&*%",

The first time there a number of years ago I got sick after eating the sausage pizza. That was after a wait for well over an hour and then having to be mistreated by some blond who I believe is/was the owner's girrel friend. I was not the only one ignored and berated by this woman. She is cwertainly no walking advertisement for this restaurant. Since that ime, I have returned and the food is acceptable but the pizza is not world-class by any means. Better than pizza hut--yes--but better than others, certainly not. And more improtantly, the service is horrendous and the rudeness of this woman is deplarable!   I would give this 1/2 star rating just to be kind as I klnow and see that Chris is a very hard worker and there all the time. It's just that he should be more sympathetic toward his custoemrs and be aware of the obnoxious woman and how she offends customers. Also the purpsoe of a dinner is not to make an evening of the event. By beign forced like cattle into a ber area where one spends more money than on the dinner is not my idea of an enjoyable time.",

    "text": "After seeing this place talked about on TV and via word of mouth, I expected amazing pizza.  Unfortunately, the margherita pizza by itself won't even make my top 10 list.  However, when I added prosciutto, sopersatta, and garlic to my second one, it was phenomenal.  Of course, adding those toppings to any pizza would make it great, but I like the way the edges of the meat get slightly burnt and the prosciutto covers the entire slice.  The bread by itself is worth getting... super light, airy, nutty, and fruity all at the same time!  We got there way before opening and were the next to get in when the restaurant filled.  But, no big deal, went to the bar next door and got called to the restaurant in an hour.  The bar has 2 drafts and 6 bottles.  The restaurant has a crappy beer selection... one draft only?!  Losing major points for that... pizza and beer is a great combo and they're missing out on the opportunity to sell beer.  It's a cool building and I respect the pizza makers... It is 4 star pizza, but the hype is overdone and it has to lose a star when you need to wait in 120 degree weather for a few hours to get a pizza that only deserves a little hype.",

    "text": "I must admit I was skeptical about all the rave I heard about Pizzeria Bianco.  We arrived at 4:45 behind at least 12 other parties.  So I knew we'd wait quite a while.  Seeing that there were at least 6 tables on the patio and one long picnic style table between the pizzeria and the wine bar next door, I was frustrated to have to wait to dine inside and asked why we couldn't dine outside.  The answer was simply if they served more parties the quality of the food would be compromised.  So I remained patient.  We went to the wine bar next door and had a few glasses of wine.  Our Phoenix relative met us there and took us to the pub across the street.  We had a few beers while one of us went back to the pizzeria every 45 minutes to check on our wait status.  Finally after 2 and a half hours we were called in to dine.  The building was first a machine shop from the early 20th Century.  So of course it's got an interesting character.  We were seated in the back of the building where behind a tall counter the owner throws his pizza crust and fires it in the large brick kiln which apparently came from Italy.  First up an order of wine.  While they're selection is fairly diverse it's not great.  So I order some decent wines and sip a bit while we wait for our pizza.  We ordered a Rosa, a Wiseguy and a MARGHERITA.  I tried to order my pizzas with easy cheese as I always do.  Pizza always comes with way too much cheese that is usually not the best quality.  Everyone in my party urged my not to do this.  I'm glad I listened to them!  Just enough cheese on every pizza.  The pizzas were made with such balanced flavors.  The Rosa was my favorite!  I think it was either drizzled with a little olive oil which brought the different flavors together.  The fresh herbs with the and cheese were complimented by the sweet onion with delightful crunch added by the delicious Arizona pistachios!  The crust was perfect!  Thin enough not to overwhelm the flavors of the well designed ingredients yet just thick enough at the end of each slice to add a crispy finish to a delightful experience.  I really don't think my review does True justice for Pizzeria Bianco.  One must experience it for oneself to see how spending 3 hours to eat pizza could be one of the best dining experiences ever!  Cheers Chef Bianco!",

    "text": "It's Overrated! Plain and simple! The reason it's famous is that it offers aspects that most Phoenix restaurants lack: (1) It's not a chain (2) It has hip swanky northern California feel as it is next to a wine bar. It didn't hurt that Jerry Colangelo would publicly recommend this place for a date and soon it just became a hit.   It was a trendier option to the usual bar food right before a Suns game.  That's how it got famouse.  People would park and dine here early before Diamondback and Suns games and then walk to the game afterwards. However, when the #1 ranking came out, it just drove this place through the roof. The food hasn't changed. Yes, they make great pizza but like another reviewer mentioned, i can think of at least 5 places in Phoenix that offer better pizza.  Is it worth the wait...most certainly not.  It's just annoying now because any out-of-town guest wants to dine here and taste the \"best pizza in America\" and they are always let down.",

    "text": "\"Woo hoo -- as good as it gets\" and then some. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix and easily the best pizza I have ever eaten and will continue to eat. I live in Boston and will continue to make Pizzeria Bianco and Bar Bianco one of my stops when I visit AZ. I have waited for 3 hours for pizza at Bianco's and I'm proud to say it. There are typically 3-5 pizzas on a menu per night. Different nights have different pizzas b/c Chris, the owner AND the chef (he's the only one who makes the pizza, about 200 night) gets all his ingredients fresh and if they aren't fresh, he doesn't use them. The Wiseguy is by far the most unique but delicious format but the Bianco is my favorite -- a margarita. The appetizers are just as good as the pizza itself. The mozzerella wrapped in prosciutto is to die for. Always super fresh and everything comes to your table hot. Next door to Pizzeria Bianco is Bar Bianco -- brilliant concept. Wait here, or outside in the courtyard with a glass of wine and a plate of cheese and crackers, etc. The cheese is not something to be taken lightly either -- he hand picks all the cheeses and you always get something yummy. Honestly, the family atmosphere, the service, the fresh ingredients and the delicious meals here are like no other experience. When you are in Phoenix, do like we do and dine with the Biancos. They will take care of you. Oh, and as for that long wait -- it's worth it but it's not for the crabby, complaining folk. It's for someone looking forward to a great meal with great people in a great place. It's no secret you might wait at Bianco's for a table but neither is the wonderful meal and people you'll meet. ENJOY!",

The staff is incredibly friendly and professional.  The whole experience is just really marvelous.  The crust is so ridiculously thin.  All of the ingredients are super fresh.  The sauce is ideal.

I loved this place, the decor was fake italian, perfect for a pizza place.  Kitchen is nice and visible, food is simple and non pretentious.  Waiters are very helpful but the hostesses are bitchy, just like NY!!!  I must confess though that I didn't have to wait more than 15 mins for a table, because I'm cool like that ;) I wish, but in reality I had reservations, and it comes free with searing looks from the rest of the folks thats been waiting in line for 3-5 hours.  I really didn't bother with the menu we just asked our water to bring us his favorite combination of 8 pizzas and then enjoyed couple of bottles of wine and some antipasto (the roasted vegetable platter), which was sooooo good.  Pizza was amazing, and didn't disappoint one bit.  Ingredients were fresh, honest, and each component held it's own.  the crust was crispy and delicious, sauce was simple and non-overpowering, and the cheese was minimal, just like any good pizza joint should be.    for a place this exclusive, the price was pretty down to earth, there wasn't an item on the menu more than 17$, can't beat that.  I can see why people would give this place 1 star, because it's a pain in the ass to wait so long for just pizza, and I could see people giving it 3-4 stars just because the experience as a whole, was disappointing.  In reality this is a 5 star pizza place, with 4 star service, and 1 star for the wait, but you should at least try it out once.",

    "text": "It's all been said before, but I'll give it my shot. But first: Get this straight: I was drug down here against my will. I had no desire to wait 2+ hours for ANY pizza, never mind one that's served with a side of attitude (that was what I expected after reading all the reviews).  Here's what I learned.   The place next door (also owned by the Bianco's) has a good selection of wine, beer, bottled waters and soda. None of the \"Big 3\" breweries either, to my relief. Nice micro stuff. It's small. It's much cooler than standing outside. It's easy to spend a bunch of money while you wait for the restaurant to call over and let you know your table is ready. Note that you still have to stand in line initially to get \"on the list\" for Pizza seating, but you can send someone in to get beverages and tables while someone stands in line next door.  Pizzeria itself is small (obvious from the other reviews n'est pas?). Our wait staff was quick and friendly - no troubles with the hostess either.   Food is awesome, although I don't think the mozzarella is \"all that\" like some would have you believe. After all -fresh mozzarella is pretty easy to make yourself. Google it, if you don't believe me.   Anyway, we all 4 had different pizzas. I went Margherita with garlic because I didn't want my thin crust all weighed down with stuff - I wanted to see what the place really had as far as sauce and crust, so that's really the best way to go. Others loaded up. All were extremely satisifed.   Was it worth 2 hours and $150+ between pizza, apps and drinks? That's a hard call, and the reason I gave this 4 stars...which I really wanted to be 3.75 but Yelp doesn't do fractions. Now, to check out Grimaldi's and see if their simulated NY water machine makes any difference to AZ water and its inclusion in a dough.",

You think the wait at Olive Garden on the prom night is bad? You ain't seen nothing yet! The wait can be longer than Jaden Smith receiving an Oscar nomination from the Academy. The pizza is delicious but you are going to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait. Don't look for support or the hook up from the hostess, she has got a thousand sheep right behind you waiting to be fed. If you leave in disgust or frustration, an eyelash will not be batted and one tear will not be shed.

Now for us parents, we are a bit more adventurous and we got the Sonny boy (for my husband....salami/their version of pepperoni and olives) and one with half Rosa (rosemary, red onions, smokey crisp pistachios, with a parmesean-reggiano cheese combination) and half ???? (fennel sausage, grilled onions, and fresh mozzarella).  I have never tasted anything like these pizzas!  I'm hooked....I only wish there was one closer to our home!  It's worth the drive, though.  I happened to be down near the place while I was running some errands and I got the pizzas to go.  Typically they don't do take out orders, but since they weren't too busy yet (3:30 on a Wed.), they were willing to do it.  The staff is very friendly and the bartender who took my order was great in describing the menu to me.  I can see why this place gets so busy....it is a small, quaint like restaurant with the big open oven as the centerpiece.  It is very cool and I was able to watch them make my pizzas.  They do have some nice outdoor seating, too.  I highly recommend this pizza place!!!",

Menu has like 5 choices, I understand its a speciality restaurant but then every item has to be super. Sorry big disappointment. Wanted to go there since long but would never ever go there again. I dont recommend it at all.",

    "text": "I was first informed of Pizzeria Bianco from watching a Bon Appetit special on Food Network that featured the best of \"...\". Third place was Mozza in Los Angeles, Second was Di Fara's and the best in the country was Pizzeria Bianco. Coming from a renowned source making a \"best in the country\" statement is pretty bold. Why Lombardi's in NY or Frank Pepe's in New Haven didn't finish top 3, I'll never know...  So I had a floating holiday that I took and decided to take the family to Phoenix, AZ. The main reason? To call out Bon Appetit on their bluff. Read up from many sources, like Yelp and Chowhound, and was told to get in line at least 1.5 hours before they open @ 5pm. You can read from the other reviews that they spent 3-4 hours waiting to get in. Plan ahead and you'll avoid their fates...  Got there @ 3:15pm on a Friday with mags and a cold drink. Within 15 mins, two cars pulled into the parking lot and within 30 minutes, twenty people lined up behind me. Thank God I did not take the warning lightly and so we waited...  Finally opened @ 5pm and not a second earlier. Got seated and we ordered the homemade mozzarella, tomatoes and basil appetizer. The real deal definitely tastes different than the factory produced ones: it had texture and character, but could use a splash of balsamic vinegar. Highly recommended. We then ordered the Margherita (ask for extra basil) and the Wiseguy. The Wiseguy was thick wood roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella and fennel sausage. While other tables took their leftovers home, we demolished dem two pizzas. The verdict: while it was the best pizza I had on the west coast, I must say it was not the best in the country, although it came very close. I am thankful that they are only 6 hours away from So Cal, so a weekend trip can be had at any time.  Housekeeping notes: Make sure to start a wait list. There are going to be snakes that try to jump the line. Pizzeria Bianco doesn't start their list until 5pm, so that only applies to the second seating. Bring reading materials and cold drinks (as it was 100 outside).  Stay hungry, my friends...and good eatings!",

    "text": "Yesterday we walked right up to dine at LUNCH TIME and got in WITH NO WAITING AT ALL!  We started with sharing the market salad it was perfectly dressed and came with the freshest greens , goat cheese and strawberries that were special ,meaning not the supermarket Frankenstein berries but REAL farmers market type and you really can taste the difference .  As far as I know the only thing you can't order at lunch time is the great Antipasto and also the Bar Bianco opens near dinner time .  We ordered two pizzas the Rosa and the Wise Guy .  We both agree the Rosa was the most interesting pizza but at the time I thought the rosemary was missing and the strongest taste was the Parmigiano Regiano . The crust had a small amount of raw flour and black burnt air pops . Still I thought this was a good pizza and took most of it home and also ordered a Biancoverde to take home and have for dinner latter .  We make some discoveries in the reheating process .  One I wasn't thinking and the Biancoverde doesn't reheat well and that is my fault I should have known but I wanted to try it since I never had that one before and it sounded too heavy for lunch time but it really wouldn't have been because it is  VERY lightly topped with Mozzarella , Parmigiano Reggiano , Ricotta and Arugula . In the reheating process this became very oily and sort of partially fell apart and the arugula fried itself to a crisp . The other discovery was the reheating process improved the Rosa pizza making the pistachios come to life and making the pizza taste wonderful I did notice rosemary was used but not every slice had a leaf . This has been our third or fourth time dining here but our first time with out all the waiting and chatting with strangers and drinking a few bottles of wine and also the first time not enjoying the Fabulous Antipasto . What I am trying to say is dining here during the day loses the MYSTIQUE , the ALLURE and the Romanticism that is associated with Pizzaria Bianco and sort of seems like you are getting your Birthday Present handed to you unwrapped .  If you asked me until just before my last visit I would have rated this 4-5 stars but now it really seems more 3-4ish and I also forgot to add the only iced tea is a bottled sweetened iced tea and they also offer house bottled water or Mexican Bottled Coke .  I thought I remembered the pizza much better? or maybe it was the wine and all the anticipation? or maybe it was different? don't KNOW?  Maybe it is the Best Pizza...I don't know but I think your first try should be at dinner time .",

Sometime there is a long wait, but they take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. There are plenty of great bars around the restaurant, so waiting is not bad at all. The pizza is interesting. Most places have basic Italian classics and Bianco has a bit more flair. I can't remember the name of the pizza I usually get, but it has pistachios on it  and it is killer! They have some good wine by the glass as well. It is definitely worth stopping by and checking out if you have the chance!",

Also, it seemed as if everyone got bread and oil and we had to ask our waiter for that instead of him bringing it to us.

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After  Cited as \"the best pizza in America\" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the True pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protege of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez.  My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time.  When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \"slice of heaven\".  And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, \"Well, the wait hasn't changed\".  Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, \"Are you cooking tonight?\" To which he replied, \"No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar.  At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed!  So what makes for the \"best pizza in America\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!",

    "text": "Here is my (probably not unique) take on Pizzeria Bianco:  Don't come here on a budget, order away, and leave satisfied.  Don't expect to walk right in, unless you plan ahead (get there at 4pm), *and* come on an off night.  Life isn't fair, so pay attention to who is arriving before and after you as you arrive (if early) as we have been placed on the honor system, otherwise you may not make the first wave.  So, on to the grub. They have (uber-cold) 4peaks Sunbru on draft. This beer HAS to be super cold for me to like it, and it was that, and it pairs great with pasta/pizza. We started off with the Antipasto, and yeah, we ate it all. The veggies cooked in wood gave it a nice flavor. Not necessarily the best antipasto ever, but different, and an excellent appetizer. We ordered a Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives) and a Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage). The Wiseguy is a white pizza, which I am usually not too fond of, but the fennel sausage and ultra thin crust it was excellent. The real winner in this meal was the Sonny Boy. Literally covered in thin, crisping salami and mozzarella cheese that actually had flavor, this was hands down the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  I will come here again, early, hopefully often.",

However, I left a believer in this tiny re-purposed building serving up Napoli-style pies, and have been back since. Each time, I was with a large group, so there was a bit of a wait. No sweat, as Bar Bianco (the accompanying small building twenty yard away from the pizzeria) is a cozy \"bar\" that feels more like someone's house (as it probably was when built in the early 1900's). The service at BB has been dynamite on both visits. After getting seated in PB's one room that houses the dining area, small bar, and brick oven, the service was prompt and friendly. Between my two visits, I have tried each pie, and the Rosa gets my vote as the premier pizza on the menu. Be brave and order it sans sauce (as the chef intended). It will not disappoint. Other favorites include the Biancoverde and Wiseguy. After visiting twice in one year, I plan on making Bianco a regular stop when I am in the Phoenix area visiting family.",

Not a good place for parties over 4, sweet spot is a party of two. I would recommend arriving 30 min before opening, to ensure you get in. Have eaten there before, food is outstanding....

    "text": "Once upon a time, Yahoo decided to take a break from their usual stories about the top ten uses for mustard, or celeb fashion faux pas, and wrote about the best pizza places in the US.  Pizzeria Bianco was on that list.  Since I was in Phoenix, and staying two blocks away, I had to try.  From what I was told by fellow diners, the wait can be as long as three hours.  I can see why.  Not only do they now have national fame because they are featured in many publications, but locals actually like this place.  Good thing I came late enough to enjoy some pizza before they closed, but I also made it just in time before the Diamondbacks game let out.  Which brings up a good point, if you want to try this place, avoid Dback games nights.  Being right next door to the stadium, Bianco is at ground zero.  The pizza I ordered was the Biancoverde, aka rabbit food pizza.  No tomato sauce, just cheese and various greens like arugula and spinach.  Quite tasty I might say.  So much so, that I had the Marghartia and the Sonny Boy.  You see what I did was sit at the bar, and traded slices with people sitting next to me.  We all got a good variety.",

That's what I do and it works nearly every time.  Or you can make a reservation, just be flexible and/or plan ahead.    The wait staff has always been very pleasant, perhaps because I catch them early in the evening, perhaps not.  Either way, the food is the star here.  Perhaps the pizza is not for everyone, but just about everyone.  The pizza comes out blistered from the searing oven dripping with flavors I didn't know could come from a pizza.  In fact, I was living in Chicago the first time I had it and it ruined all other pizza for me.  Recently, a place 1.5 hours away from Chicago that was an admitted copy of Bianco was named one of the top 5 pizzas IN Chicago.  It's not even close to Chicago but it was good enough to rate that high.  Enough said in my mind. I am not a reviewer but rather I feel I need to speak up for this business and the work Chris and his staff are doing here.  Local ingredients, mozzarella made each day and the best tasting bread in the state, hands down.  Keep it up, Chris and company.  I would eat here every night if I could.",

With that being said, Grimaldi's Pizza is just as good (minus the wait).  Pay attention: If you go with a group of 4 or more, be prepared to wait mostly due to the fact that they do not go in the order you were put on the wait list. This is very important to note. They will fill circles of 2's and 3's around and before you before your group ever even lays eyes on that infamous brick oven.    I went with a large group of people (7 ppl), and we had to wait for.... wait for it........... 6 HOURS. SEIS HORAS! I'm convinced that not only is the wine bar next door owned by Bianco but the Irish pub as well. They are making a ton of money making you wait if that were True.....  If you are prepared to wait, you have to bring your own entertainment. For real. This place has that whole leisure European \"what's the rush?\"  feel to it. This means engaging in long and stimulating, thought-provoking conversation. Bring a game of monopoly. or chess! I do not recommend this place for a first date as boredom may creep in and put the pressure on to find common interests.... besides the pizza.",

My first recommendation is avoid the valet parking and park on Monroe street one street north. There is always parking on Monroe and it saves you the 3 dollars plus the tip I'm always obligated to do when dealing with valet services. The pizza is wonderful but it can be a bit pricey. Splitting one pizza between two people isn't very filling so you're probably going to end up getting two. I do admire the area of heritage square you almost get the vibe you're not in Phoenix.",

I make my own pizza most of the time and everyone raves about how good it is but as far as I am concerned this is the BEST pizza in all of Arizona.  The crust is light and crispy, the toppings are fresh and flavorful and above all interesting.  I read an article in the Arizona Republic about how the vendors at the farmers market save their best for Chris Bianco (who last I knew personally shopped for the ingredients every day) because they like him so much and respect him.  I totally believe that.  I don't like the wait when you got there during busy time but I have to respect that he keeps the place small and the quality high.",

    "text": "I am the 697th review for Pizzeria Bianco, so what on earth can I add that hasn't already been said? Well, most of the reviews say that the wait is several hours long, which used to be True. In fact, several years ago, I actually waited for about an hour and a half. However, just recently, we walked through Heritage Square on the way to the ballpark. It was 6:30 PM on a Friday night and there was no way we ever would have imagined there would be room for us to dine. However, when we walked by, we noticed two spots at the bar. Could it be? We walked inside and yes, it was actually True! There were two seats at the bar just waiting for us. We couldn't have planned it if we tried, yet there we were sitting down on a Friday night at Pizzeria Bianco without a wait. I think this happened because Pizzeria Bianco has been open for lunch for awhile now and there isn't the excitement of waiting in line for them to open the doors at 5:30 PM. Whatever the case is, I think it's important to note that you might not have to wait for the two hours anymore...I think it all depends on the night.   Food wise, I will second what so many of these reviews say. I really, really like the pizza here and the Margarita pizza is a number one best seller for a reason. It has this buttery taste of perfection with every simple bite. The salad was so fresh I thought something was off, until I realized that I just hadn't ever had such fresh lettuce before! I wouldn't wait for two hours to eat here, but if there's room to sit without a wait, then I will definitely eat here again in the future.",

The waiter was kind enough to let us do 1/2 and 1/2 with our pizza so we went with 1/2 Margherita and 1/2 arugula white pizza.  My dining companion does not like arugula, so we ordered it just as a white pizza.  The margherita was good but not the best I have had, but the white pizza was amazing.  Such delicious parmesan flavor.  I am sure it would have been even better with the arugula.  I would definitely return!",

We decided to give it a try about a year ago. We got there at 5 pm and the line was really long and we were told the wait would be 3 hours. We decided probably not worth the wait.  After reading the mixed reviews on Yelp we decided we were committed to the wait and would give it another try. We got there at 3:30 pm on March 18th, a Friday night. The restaurant holds 43 people. We ended up being #37 and #38 lol. I would recommend getting there at least by 3:30 pm so that you will make it in the 1st round into the restaurant. If you come any later than that you will probably have to wait 3+ hours.  The waiter and staff were extremely friendly and quick. We were served bread and oil. The bread was very hard and dry but we still ate it all. We also ordered salads- the local organic greens with red vinaigrette. It was literally that. Ok, but very fresh. I ordered the Margherita pizza with the fennel sausage. It was really good. Best pizza ever....not to me. My husband ordered the Wiseguy pizza -wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. He liked it as well and said he liked my pizza better. Also stated not the best pizza he's ever had. We really like Gino's on the East of Chicago- deep dish golden crust pizza so maybe this wasn't exactly our style of pizza to claim \"Best Pizza that ever touched our lips\"   I would recommend giving it a try. We enjoyed our pizza and our night out. Our wait wasn't that long. Would I go again? Probably not.",

Okay I can say it's probably the best in Arizona. But outside of NY, I still prefer Apizza Scholls in Portland, OR. The crust at PB seems to lack salt. Although crispy and thin, it lacks flavor. I got half and half Wise Guy (onion and fennel sausage + mushroom) and Margherita. I'll give the Wise Guy a 3 out of 5 because it's kind of bland. The Margherita I'll give a 4 out of 5. The sauce is pretty good. But every pizza I've had at Apizza Scholls in Portland, OR I've given 5 out of 5.

My boyfriend and I had spent the day in downtown Phoenix, and decided to give Bianco a try. We got there a little after 4, and were 12 and 13th in like respectively (it was a weekday.) We were in the first group seated, which was a relief after the August heat.  Although I was braced for serious rudeness, the service was polite, and one of the waiters was willing to take a moment to explain the menu, which I appreciated.  We ordered the Margherita and the Rosa. The Margherita wasn't bad. I mean, it was cheese pizza with some basil leaves. Edible, certainly, but by no means a revelation. The Rosa, on the other hand, was awash in olive oil. It was massively greasy, almost to the point of being inedible.  I don't know if it was the people in the building, or the building itself, but the acoustics were terrible - my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other.  In all honesty, I've had much  more pleasant dining experiences at Buca De Bepo and Oreganos. So much for the best pizza on the west coast.",

They only have bottled Soda so no refills for which is kind of odd and a bit expensive. I guess they want to move people out.  The pizza's are a pretty good size for one hungry person or to share if you have two not so hungry people.  I got the pistachio pizza and it was pretty good.

    "text": "It's been over a year since the last time I went to Pizzeria Bianco, and I am admitedly a very harsh pizza critic. The first time I went to Bianco's I loved the pizza. It was incredible.    This time, a friend was in town and wanted to go to the famous \"Pizzeria Bianco\" so we went at lunch to avoid the 2 hour wait.  To be very honest, the pizza just wasn't that good - over cooked & dry.  The salad was good & the bread was great, but we went for the pizza!   There was no wait at lunch & the service was better. But I have to say that the pizza at Grazies & The Parlor are better. The incredible dough was always the best thing about the pizza at Biancos...but it was not very good this time. It's lost the chewiness and was more like a cracker.   So unfortunately, I won't be back. Grazie's has become my pizzeria of choice in town now.",

    "text": "Another disappointed visit.  I am starting to think this isn't a fluke and PB has lost it's magic touch.  We went for my wife's birthday around 4pm on a Wednesday.  We actually walked right in and sat down.  We were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over 3 hours.    The staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables.  We put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto, a wise guy, and a caprese salad.  The bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in.  I can't remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for 30 seconds before they serve it to you.  Next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto.  Not a big deal.  Maybe he didn't hear me, maybe the cook didn't hear him?  My wife confirms I did request it and I'm not losing my mind.  The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch.  The crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster.  Even though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members.  Finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill.  She brings it to us and when I give her my card I gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill.  Another guy brings the bill back for me to sign.  The 6 dollar prosciutto is still on it.  I inform him that there was no prosciutto and I told the other woman but it's still here.  I don't know if she thought I was just making small talk or what but I sure am not paying 6 bones for some sliced ham that wasn't even on my pizza.  He took care of it.  Here's the deal.  I don't know if it's because I didn't wait 3-5 hours to eat or if it's just falling apart without Chef Bianco but PB has definitely lost it's way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not.  I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case.  They are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long.  Just because PB is famous and Chef Bianco is world renown doesn't mean you are.    The dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way I would ever wait in line to eat here again.  If you read my previous review you will see I am not a PB hater and actually was a huge advocate.  I guess all good things really do come to an end.",

    "text": "We don't get all they hype about this place?! We are a 46 year old couple with no kids and dine out at least 3 nights a week. We love to try new places.  I always read Yelp for great, fun places to go for date night. This time I didn't have time to read the reviews but I had heard this place was on Oprah or the travel channel or some cooking show, so It's got to be great right?   This date night we had tickets to see Les Miserables at 7:30 on a Saturday for my Man's B-day. I called the restaurant on Tuesday to see about getting reservations for Saturday because I had heard about the nightmarish wait times because it is just THAT GOOD! They said they only allow 4 reservations and they were all full. Umm, ok...Well that's just wonderful. I explained that we were willing to come early so we could be through and get to Phoenix Theatre for our show. The woman said to call back at 4:30 on Saturday and she would tell us how long the wait would be. I did and we got in after 10 minutes! (at 5 pm) Yay! I thought, this is a great start to birthday night.    When we walked in it was extremely cramped, the tables are almost on top of each other. A very large man was seated behind us and I saw people just give up and go around. It was also EXTREMELY LOUD, the loudest place I have been in quite a while. We were seated right in the middle at a tiny table that barely had elbow room. I started to feel claustrophobic and couldn't hear a thing my man was saying and he couldn't hear me. I spotted and pointed to a newly vacant table in the corner and we made a mad dash for it. Ahhh... a little quieter but I still couldn't hear well.   Then I looked at the menu which was only about four choices of pizza to order from. I thought that we would share a pizza but when the waitress came by she explained that the pizzas were about the size of a dinner plate and most adults get their own. Then I looked at the price and about had a heart attack! Now, I am not a tightwad, I will pay dearly for excellent food. Then I was shocked to see that for the price we were going to pay the salads were not included? Really? This is a pizza joint, not the Four Seasons Resort.   The pizza came quickly. I was soooooooo disappointed. I am what you might call a pizza whore. I could eat pizza every day. I won't though because I would be huge. I ordered the Margherita and my man had the Sonny Boy. We were never served any bread and oil while we waited either. The pizza crust was so thin I bet I could have seen light through it and the sides were burnt.  I get the wood fired oven thing but this was ridiculous! There was a tiny amount of sauce, even tinier amount of cheese and 4, count 'em, FOUR pieces of basil. Now, I'm not saying it tasted bad after I broke off all the burnt pieces, it was just ok. It was nothing special and not worth the 40.00 we spent for 2 small pizzas and no drinks with tip. My hands were black and my man somehow got black all down his white sleeve. Then driving to the show in the car I noticed that I had black all over my neck! I know I really get into my pizza but come on! I shouldn't need a bath after. We won't bother coming here again because when we left I said to my man with a big grin on my face \"I'm still hungry where should we go for dinner?\" He laughed and said \"Me too! That was a huge rip off for $40.00 and you leave hungry.\"  Our conversation was overheard by some guy and he said \"I hear that a lot.\" Hmmmmmm",

Forget all the fuss you've heard about extended wait times and long lines, blah blah blah.  Waiting here for a table is half the fun, so get your name on the list and chill out.  I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but if you don't want to wait for dinner, go at lunch.  We usually show up at 11:15 or 11:30 and wait no more that 15-20 minutes for a table.   The pizza perfect in every way, starting with the ridiculously crispy/soft/slighty-chewy/thin crust to the perfect blend of minimal toppings that compliment each other more than new couples in puppy love. The Biancoverde is my all time fav, but you must try the Rosa which is this amazing mix of red onion, parmigiana and pistachios...unbelievable.   Remember...don't hate...appreciate (that you have one of the best pizza joints in the world right in your backyard)",

    "text": "The following is a live-Yelp of my first experience at Pizzeria Bianco.  Wine: Primitivo, Antico Sigillo '10 Salento, Italy (red) I'm starting out with the usual wait (45 minutes this time) at the bar next door*. I was impressed that the hostess will come over to let you know when your table is ready. The interior of the bar is warm, intimate, and very cute. I usually take my reds from California, Spain, Australia, and Argentina...this Italian is very impressive. Full-bodied, fruity (blueberry notes), very mellow tannins, consistent from the front to the back end. Thanks to the knowledgable bartender, I have a new favorite.  *The wait was more like 15 minutes. It pays to dine solo.  Pizza: Rosa, with extra fennel sausage - excellent, but not for red sauce lovers When the waiter set my pizza on the counter, my eyes got very big. It arrived piping hot and smelling delicious. It's as delicious as it smells and looks, too. The pistachios, cheese, and red onions are all melted into the wonderful crispy-tender bread. I'll ask for some olive oil...my promise to lose five pounds before New Year's Eve is now destroyed. The olive oil made a great thing even better...great for dipping the extra crust into.  Summary: Artisan bread lovers and native Italians, rejoice! Dominoes take-out palettes, Chicago pizza casserole gobblers, New York grease slice fanatics, and characters of the Jersey Shore persuasion... you might want to sit this one out.",

We arrived on a Monday evening at right about 6pm and there was a 30 minute wait  for a table or the bar was completely open besides two other people sitting there. We were hungry so we took the bar!   The seats were comfortable and we never felt like we were in the way of other customers or staff like you do at almost any other restaurant where you take a bar seat. Plus, I was sitting up high enough at the end of the bar to see into the wood burning stove where the pizzas cook. Rad.   Our service was killer. Super polite, friendly, yet real. What my man likes to call \"service with a smile.\" It was that! They would refill our wine or beer for us and supply more napkins. Because we are messy you see. The bread and olive oil they bring out to you as a starter is so delicious. I need to find out what type of olive oil that is! We then ordered the mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil salad and the Margarita pizza and added mushrooms. The mushrooms added so much flavor to an already delicious pizza.  I'm excited to try this place again! From what I hear, wait times can be brutal so it looks like we lucked out.",

I'll be quite frank: it was on my must-do list before I left Phoenix and moved abroad, so I called up some willing participants and planned an early weeknight dinner (630ish) to curtail the wait.  We put in our name and bee-lined for Bar Bianco (see my review). Waited just about an hour, if not less (it was June, after all, not exactly Phoenix's popular season). The pizza was good. Really good, in fact. And everyone was very happy with their pizzas and the service.   Now for the frank part. I've been gone a year now and have a long list of restaurants I MUST eat at the next time I come home for a visit. Bianco's isn't on it. Cibo is.   That is all.",

I didn't think it could actually live up to the hype, but I was wrong. We arrived just before opening around 10:45 on a Tuesday morning, knowing that we had to beat the crowds. I love the fact that they only have 6 very simple pizzas to choose from, but they will make them half and half so you can enjoy a variety. We ordered an arugula and strawberry salad to start and two pizzas. In short, it was the best pizza I have ever had. The crust is wonderfully charred and somehow both incredibly crispy and chewy at the same time. I ordered two thinking we could take the leftovers for the road... there were no leftovers. Should have ordered three so we could have tried all 6 varieties. We had the Rosa, the Biancoverde, the Margherita, and the Wiseguy and each one was perfectly balanced. Picking a favorite would be harder than picking a favorite child. Can't wait to get back to Phoenix so I can try the other pizzas and some of their dinner-only appetizers.",

We were not sure of the parking so we parked in the parking garage down the street.  parking garage cost 15 dollars to park.

Back at the restaurant, we ordered the farmer's market salad (arugula, apple, candied nuts, feta), the Wise Guy, and a pie split between the two vegetarian white pizzas (forgot the names!).

    "text": "I have read reviews about this place for years and finally came on a short stop into Phoenix en route to California. We enjoyed the pizza rosa and the antipasti. Our children LOVED the pizza Margherita which was great for us since they are picky eaters. I appreciated the flavors, texture of the crust and originality of the combinations. I would recommend this place and come back. I did not experience a wait or chaos because we went on a Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. It was relaxing. For parking the best bet is the parking structure behind the square where you pay $1.00 for 2 hours with validation from the restaurant. Salud!",

    "text": "My review is being taken down a notch. Here is why. Being a self proclaimed, well traveled, foodie on the fly, I can honestly say that the valley of the sun has some pretty amazing pizza this side of Italy. Pizzeria Bianco does not disappoint. My last visit, however, it disappointed on just about every level, minus taste. Although, I will caveat with my foodie tongue and say that it's not ever been my favorite pizza in town, no matter what the 'pro's' like Food & Wine may say. I say that Pomo wins that award, hands down. On a Friday night, my hubs and I decided to have an impromptu date night and head to one of our favorite hang outs: Heritage Square. We expected to wait, but we love the Bianco Bar next door. Now, Pizzeria Bianco has always been a little on the 'snooty' side with this, 'we will let you know if you are in OUR bar next door', turning the nose up at Rose and Crown across the ten paces way.. and that is okay. It's left unsaid. You will get it if you visit here. Again, not a worry, because the staff at the bar attached/not attached to the pizzeria has friendly staff who let you sample and TAKE your time whilst waiting for the pizzeria to open up. We got into Pizzeria Bianco and like most nights we are both home in PHX and on a date night, we like to take our time, sip a wine and talk to each other. Immediately we have the PB waitress speaking to us and asking us if we knew what we wanted. I had not even looked at my menu and I told her so. Literally we had been seated for about 3 minutes. She is there again within 4 or 5 and I went with the chianti. She asked if we knew what we wanted for food. Nope. We didn't. My husband headed to the loo and she approached the table while he was in there asking me yet again about the food order. The theme felt very rushy to both of us. I now gave her a look because I was getting irritated. Again. Date night. Quaint, cute Pizzeria Bianco, wine, candles and I don't want you rushing me! SO STOP. Finally we ordered our apps of the Spiedini, (prosciutto wrapped around warm fontina).. It was not as good as I remembered it from before, but it could have been that I was so irritated with this waitress clearly attempting to churn us out of a nice evening to accompany more people that I could not get past it. On to the pizza. The Sonny Boy does not disappoint. The crust is great with an artisanal premium texture and taste. We added the wood roasted mushrooms for added flavor. We ignored this waitress coming over and over again and enjoyed our pizza. Let's face it, we are the customers, pure and simple. Paying. Customers. I would loved to have had another chianti here because I do love the ambience and the candle light of Pizzeria Bianco, the open brick oven and the pizza and bread smells of it all baking. That said, we finished our dinner and took our night elsewhere with no plans of coming back for pizza anytime soon. Accolades or what not, I personally did not ever think this was the best pizza in the valley, but I did have a fondness and love for the place itself. I've now been lost on the service factor. Boo.",

    "text": "The original Phoenix pizza place. 5/5 for food and 4/5 for service.  This place is super small and crowded, but we were happy to be able to see the original heritage square location, with the wood-fire ovens and authentic dishes. We'll be trying the Camelback location soon.  Food: We got one of the salads to start with, which was very good, but not the star of the show. This was followed by the Wiseguy (roasted onion, house mozzarella, and fennel sausage) and Biancoverde (house mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, and ricotta, topped with arugula) pizzas. My husband preferred the Wiseguy, while I liked the Biancoverde better, but we agreed that both pizzas were phenomenal. Next time, we'll try a red sauce pizza. What surprised us was that the dessert, a rich, dark flourless chocolate cake with a super decadent vanilla bean creme, was just as good as the pizzas. I still crave it!   Service: Very friendly - everyone was happy to answer our questions. Drink refills were a little bit slow, considering that we were there in an off time of day, but nothing to get upset over. Prepare to spend some time here waiting for them to craft the perfect food - the wait is worth it!",

I arrived at about 3pm on a Monday and didn't have to wait at all. There are tables outside but they don't let you eat there -- not really sure what the deal is there... I guess maybe when things are busy that's where people wait? Anyway, it was a nice enough day, I leashed the pup outside and grabbed a seat at the bar where I could keep an eye on him.   Simple menu, with only a few options. I did the biancoverde (ricotta & arugula). It was excellent. You really can taste the difference when the best ingredients are used -- almost on par with my aunt's famous homemade version. Which I guess is a pretty amazing feat for a restaurant. Still, it was just pizza. In fairness, I'm not sure what I was expecting -- to somehow have my mind blown by how great it was or what. It definitely isn't worth making a trip just to eat here, but it's definitely a great stop if you live or find yourself in the area.",

    "text": "My wife and 6 of our friends decided to come here for dinner last night (2-17), only 2 of our friends had ever been there before. During the day while we were making plans, I went onto the restaurant's website to look at the menu. Their menu online lists the price for the \"wiseguy\" pizza as $18...fast forward to last night and we all get menus listing the prices of all the pizzas as being $1 more than the online menu, except one in our group gets a menu where the pizza prices match the online menu prices ($1 less per pizza). We bring this to our server's attention and request the cheaper price which the restaurant is advertising. She declines and says the one menu is old, I tell her it matches the menu they advertise on their website and she says that is old too. I confirm multiple times with her that she is refusing to honor the lower price and she makes a number of other excuses. Despite the disagreement, I drop the issue so as not to risk having our food tampered with. We also let her know we would have separate checks when we ordered to which she replied she would do after our meal. She left us the bill and told us to separate it ourselves. The server did not have a name tag but the name on the bill said Hillary, so I have to make the assumption that is who served us. The food was good but not worth the price and certainly not the terrible service.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to patronize an establishment that won't honor their own advertisements, and/or appreciate a customer for bringing these mistakes to their attention so they can be corrected and save the business from more issues and unsatisfied customers in the future.",

Like freshly pumped out of the olives fresh. It was light and refreshing and absolutely delicious. The pizza itself was so thin and delicious with the fresh basil and the thin crust. Soooo good.  Everything is made fresh so you cannot call in your order and pick it up in 20 minutes. You will have to go and order in person and wait. But it's SUPER quick.

    "text": "3.5 Stars.  It's been awhile!  Me and my wife came here about 4 years ago and left a bit disappointed.  Fast forward to present day.......  We had an employee appreciation day at work, and we got to play a hand of blackjack with our boss.  If you won, you got to pick an envelope with a prize in it.  I was lucky and won my hand with a 21!  My envelope that I picked was \"Lunch with the boss\".  We could pick the place where we wanted to go, so I decided to choose here.  Me, him, his assistant and one other coworker who won all headed down here today.  I figured that it was time for a return visit and since work was paying, might as well head somewhere nice that everyone would enjoy.  This place is consistently ranked as one of the top pizzerias in the USA and the other 3 people I went with had never been.   We drove down, valet parked ($3.00) and were in the doors right around 11:30.  There were only a few other people there and we got a table right away.  We all took a quick look at the menu and then placed our order.  My last time here, I sampled the Margherita, The Rosa and The Sonny Boy.  Today, I went with The Wiseguy.  I had that and a Diet Coke to drink. Here is how everything was............  Wiseguy Pizza-  This thing was fantastic!  This pizza is a white pizza with no tomato sauce.  It came topped with lots of sausage, plenty of onions and a nice amount of  smoked mozzarella.  The sausage was sliced thin and had a great texture and taste with the fennel in it.  The onions were the perfect middle between soft yet still firm enough to have some bite.  The cheese was awesome too..cant beat a fresh homemade mozzarella!.  This was one of the better white pizzas I have ever had.  Biancos crust is always really thin, but today it seemed just a tad thicker than past visits.  It had a perfect char on the crust without being burnt and it had a fantastic chew.  This particular pizza gets 5 stars.  If/when I come back, it will be the only one I order!  It was great!  Diet Coke-  They serve this to you in a 12oz can.  Cost=$3.50.  Highway robbery!  Hey, at least the regular Coke is a Mexican Coke in a glass bottle and can somewhat be justified for a $3.50 beverage, but to charge $3.50 for a can of Diet Coke is outrageous!     Service was good. Our waitress was nice.  Overall, I can take this off my \"Overrated List\" since the pizza I had today was absolutely fantastic.  But, even though my lunch today was both excellent and free, I still can't see myself coming down here and paying what equates to $25.00 for a pizza and a can of Coke. 4 pizzas and 5 sodas came out to $106.00 after tip!  Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln and George Washington all frowned as they were coming out of Brandy's wallet!   It was good, but not that good.  There are many other pizza joints in Phoenix that I would head to if I had to plunk down the cash for lunch.  With that said, the next time I win a prize or get a free lunch from work, I'm headed back here for another Wiseguy...it really is a great pizza and it was head and shoulders above every other pizza I have had from any of Biancos restaurants in the past.  I just wish you didn't have to take out a second mortgage to enjoy a meal here!  That's all, folks!    Catch you on the flipside, Pizzeria Bianco.  It's been real!",

Great crust, great sauce, GREAT PIZZAS!!!  Not cheap at $80 for three pies but if you want cheap go to Pizza Hut.  Pizzeria Bianco is a one off experience not to be missed!!!",

That episode was about pizza and one of the speakers said the Rosa Pizza was his favorite pizza ever. It's not my favorite pizza. It was different. I liked it but not my favorite. It's a daughter pizza with red onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, rosemary and pistachios. It has an interesting flavor. The rosemary and pistachios combination make it a unique selection. I wanted some sort of protein and went with the prosciutto. It was probably not the best choice because it made it a bit too salty. Next time I'll try the classic margherita out the wiseguy, which seems to be pretty popular.  The space was cozy. Decor was brick and rustic. Place was clean and servers were very friendly.",

He even heard about it while on a pizza tour in NYC, so needless to say we were expecting a lot.  The restaurant itself was really cool. The wait seemed a bit unnecessary as there were several open tables, but it didn't bother me. The staff was super laid back and it made for a fun time. The Margherita and the Wiseguy were all over reviews so we had each and a half pizza of Sonny Boy. Hands down Sonny Boy was the best. Margherita was really good too, but the Wiseguy kind of disappointed.   We also had the Spiedini which was good, but not worth the cost. Looking back at the meal, the cost didn't seem to line up with the level of taste. It was good, but not $40 good. Very cool environment, awesome staff, and overall a good pie. If you're looking for a True pizza spot that is fun, lively, and new - definitely try it out! Probably not a place I'd go to over and over again - just occasional visits when I'm in the mood.",

There are way too many wood-fired Neopolitan-style Pizzeria's out there out-performing this one.  Margherita ok but needs more evo and basil.  Wiseguy was ok but a bit cheesy, heavy, dry, but onions tasty. Sausage so so.   Had a Marinara with added olives and chovies. Olives just kind of thrown in there and mostly centered on a couple peices rather than spread out (not much care). Chovies were fishy, even for chovies (but not salty).  So Not worth the price of these extra ingredients ($3 for olives; $5 for chovies) olives weren't even anything that special taste wise.   Overall, good but not great, not much cornicione, crust kinda flat dry and crunchy. I like a puffier more crumb filled crust (even for this style). Some of the edges were way too hard and crispy and inedible. Out of 4 pizzas some were much more scorched than others (inconsistent).  Green salad ($6) was just some lettuce  greens and 5 green olives- nothing else, kind of a rip off really.",

When we got there around 7:30pm and had to wait about 40 minutes. We went to the little house next door which is a bar and had a couple of drinks while we waited. The entire time I was waiting, I kept thinking to myself that if I am waiting this long, this place better be good. The restaurant is pretty small so I was glad that we were seated at the bar. First thought was, this restaurant has a great atmosphere to it. Menu is not that big but has some great items. I had the Margarita Pizza and it was delicious! Nice thin crust, not too much sauce or cheese...it was just perfect! You can see them cooking the pizza's so you know their ingredients and everything is fresh! If you want a great pizza, check this place out, you won't be sorry!",

However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.  Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconsTrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!  The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.",

The lady and I were enjoying the zombie walk when we all of a sudden decided to top off the already romantic evening with a date at Bianco's. Believe it or not, we waited less than an hour for a table. That being said, I wasn't wasted when I finally got to my pizza and I wasn't a pissed off/hungry food nazi waiting to hate every bite. I was completely neutral going in.  We ordered some bread and olives to start, and they were both tasty! I would have preferred some kalamatas but the olives we received were good enough. The bread was great, and with a little bit of olive oil and salt, it was even better. As for pizzas, we ordered a Sonny Boy and a half Wiseguy, half Rosa. The Rosa was good. The rosemary and pistachios really went well with each other. The Wiseguy (the pizza that I thought would be my favorite) was just okay. The sausage had fennel in each chew, and the onions were a nice touch, but there wasn't that pop of flavor like I got from each bite of the Rosa. It's important for fancy pizza in my opinion. And, last but not least, there was the Sonny Boy. This pizza was definitely my favorite of the three. The salami, the cheeses and the olives went perfectly with one another! Those first few chews were the highlight of my visit to the pizzeria. I would order that pizza again in a heartbeat.  My bottom line...? It's good. Period. I'm not sure that I'd want to wait for 3+ hours to eat there (that's silly considering all the other great pizza places not too far from there), but if the same kind of situation that I had my first visit came about, I could see myself returning to Pizzeria Bianco.",

I went during lunch when there was no wait and I'm not sure if the pizza would be worth a one hour wait. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is definitely pretty good but I was expecting much better from a place rated among the top pizza joints in the US. One of the pizzas had a slightly burnt crust and the other wasn't crispy enough. The pizzas we tried were Rosa and the wiseguy and both had pretty good flavor.",

Real dough, real buffalo de mozzarella cheese, real tomato sauce, made in a wood fired over that adds some roasted charcoal-esque sabor to every bite.    This ain't no Domino's, Pappa moran's, or Pizza shack nonsense, this is adult food that you will appreciate.  Some of their menu items are set made pizzas and some of them are a bit unusual.  I wanted a sausage, mushroom, onion, and cheese over red sauce & I ordered it (off menu) and they made it no problemo.  Amazing.  I'm sure their suggested pies on the menu are great too, but I like my apples to apples comparison.  Now I've had my fav I keep getting the same thing.    Been there during business a couple times never busy for me because I was there at like 4pm on a weekday, or 30 minutes before closing on a weekday.  I hear it gets busy & there are lines during regular meal times, I don't wait for most places, but I would wait in line for this!",

The basil is grown in a little planter box right out front. We also indulged one the flour-less chocolate cake, and if you've never had it, OH MY GOD. It's cake that's the consistency of fudge....Also, I have read other reviewers complain about the wait, but it's a tiny quaint place, nestled in a historic village setting. What is the problem? Our hostess quoted us 20 minutes and directed us to the beer and wine bar next door which was also very cool and it was happy hour so no complaints there. The wait was only ten and we could take our drinks with us. Great food, super freindly and interesting staff. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Italian food but thinks places like Carraba's  don't quite cut it.",

The place is a little small, but the food makes up for it.  I got a pizza with mushroom and cheese, which was simple, yet tasted super good and amazing. The prices are a little high, due to the fact that the pizza is about $15 and if you want to add a topping, it's about $3 per topping, which is a little much in my opinion.",

Next time I am in the area I will probably stop by and put my name on the list, go run some errands, get ready, etc then head over to the pizzeria. There is not a lot to do in the area for 3 hours, so be prepared. Right across from the restaurant is a small pub and right next door is a wine bar. Both are chill places, so grab a drink and socialize.   The pizza is light and crispy, just how an Italian style pizza should be. We shared the Sonny Boy and Biancoverde pizzas, plus a Spiedini to start. Both were quite tasty. I enjoyed the open kitchen and the selection of bottled sodas. Make the wait at least one time while you are in Phoenix and decided for yourself.  I came here again when I was in town for the All-Star Game in July. The pizza is still great. I tried the Magherita with Prosciutto. It was really good. The best idea was to rush over here before the crowd at the game and enjoy pizza without waiting.",

First we tried to order a salad ( there are only 3 on the menu) they where out of tomatoes! How is a pizza restaurant out of tomatoes! So, we ordered the wiseguy pizza. What a complete disappointment. The pizza had absolutely no flavor at all. We had to put salt on it and add an extreme amount of peppers to make it even enable.   I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and will not be eating here again. The only reason I am giving this place a generous 2 stars is because the service and atmosphere.",

    "text": "Blog for full review:  Having now sat for perhaps thirty minutes while pies entered and exited the oven being delivered to many around us the time would finally arrive to taste the oft raved pizza of team Bianco as all four of our selections arrived simultaneously covering the table and filling the air with the smells of smoke, yeast, pork, tomato, and basil.  With much sharing to be done and pictures taken the next twenty or so minutes would consist of much less talking and far more eating than the previous thirty and beginning first with my selection - well - let's just say it lived up to the hype as the ROSA with Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, and Arizona Pistachios may just be the best \"specialty pizza\" I've ever tasted.  Beginning first with the crust - an expert balancing act between the thinness of a Neapolitan like Lucali and the chewy hole structure of that at Great Lake - it was nearly perfect as the slight char from the wood oven gave each pie a lovely crunch yet pliable interior that could support the ingredients without disturbing them.  Moving next to the toppings - no sauce here - just thinly sliced onions, intense salty cheese, crunchy smooth pistachios, and a touch of rosemary to pique everything else.  Marvelous.  Moving next to another of Bianco's signatures, the WISEGUY with wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage I was pleasantly surprised by the mildness of both the onions and the fennel, both present but not overwhelming, while the slight spice of the sausage floated above the pools of creamy cow's milk mozzarella.  Another well balanced pie, though I do feel it could have done with just a touch less olive oil...a small quibble, to be sure.  For the third choice, the BIANCOVERDE with Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, and Arugula would be the only pizza we modified from the menu description - in this case by adding a $3 supplement of Organic 'La Quercia' Prosciutto Americano from Iowa that was every bit worth the cost.  Again featuring that same pliable smoky crust but this time topping it first with the trio of cheeses before adding the arugula and prosciutto after it exited the oven this \"Salad Pizza\" was a valuable addition to the lineup largely because of the quality of the ingredients and the balance achieved by using each lightly.  From the smooth mozzarella to the puddles of ricotta and tangy Parmigiano up through the slight bitters of the greens and the powerful saline notes of the pork everything simply clicked though for some the lack of spice was an issue - an issue easily amendable by the red pepper provided on request (try getting that at Una, Lucali, or Great Lake.)  For the final selection, that of the man who'd experienced Chris' work longer and more frequently than the rest of us combined, there was no way I was going to miss out on the MARGHERITA while I was here and thankfully he'd ordered it (thus preventing me from ordering both it and the ROSA.)  With the stars of the show well known - simply the freshest Tomato Sauce with light hints of sweetness, oregano, and garlic plus Fresh Mozzarella, and Basil - this was a no nonsense sort of pie that hit on all cylinders; tangy, creamy, aromatic, smoky, and perfect.  While not the absolute greatest Margherita I've ever had, a top 5 member for sure and when paired with the rest of the menu, the service, and the setting a pizza definitely worthy of the fame especially considering the fact that Bianco uses all local ingredients including tomatoes from California in the making of his sauce.  Eating, sharing, talking, and then eating some more while the service checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else our time at Bianco felt much longer than it was and when it was all said and done only four slices remained - two of the WISEGUY and two the BIANCOVERDE - all wrapped up and going home with their respective owners while I took home with me the memories of some of the best pizza I've ever experienced and (perhaps more importantly) the experience of meeting with some great people for outstanding pizza in a setting where people have a passion for what they are doing without all the pretense.  Yeah Chris didn't build the oven and furniture by hand like Lucali, and perhaps Pizzeria Bianco doesn't fly all their ingredients in from Italy like Una, and sure Chris' health prevents him from being ever present at the oven like Dom at DiFara or Nick at Great Lake but in the end the results are the same...this is some really great pizza well worth going out of your way for.",

Since I was with my carnivore boyfriend, nothing on the menu sounded good to him except the WISEGUY, which is made with caramelized onions and fennel sausage. I do wish I had tried a different pizza but I compromised since I eat everything.  The pizza with fresh mozzarella really lacked favor. The sauce is good, I also very much enjoyed the crust, but sausage wasn't good (fennel overload) and there was no other flavor to this pizza. We also tried Sonny which was better thanks to the saltiness of the salami which the fresh moz completely lacks, but still nothing special. Unfortunately, I think $18 was too expensive for a average if not below average pizza.   I will however say that they have EXCELLENT customer service.",

    "text": "With 120+ reviews, reviewing Pizzeria Bianco is like pissing in the ocean. It's not noticeable, it won't change anything, but at least it'll feel good. To me, at least. So here's my shot at it.  Every city has one of these places--a restaurant for which people will wait hours. Standing, waiting, anticipating alleged manna from Heaven. Atlanta has a few of these. One is Nuevo Laredo Cantina. Another is Taqueria del Sol, whose line is culinary equivalent of trying to buy U2 concert tickets were they set to perform in an actual U2.  I hate going to these places. Oh, the food is fine, but I can't stand waiting in line for food. By the end of it, you don't know if the food was actually worth the wait or if your drool was simply some sort of Pavlovian response to being deprived of nutrition for hours on end.  And so it was that I originally wasn't going to come here. Unfortunately (or, as it turns out, fortunately) my manhood was questioned by another Yelper and I made the trek from my hotel room in Chandler to Pizzeria Bianco. That was Tuesday night. The wait for a single person, I was told, was 2.5 hours. I thanked them and continued on my way.  That would've been the end of it for most places, but the smell in there was incredible. Burning wood, cooking meats, herbs mixing with liquid fat--I pledged to come back and do better.  A few days later, I tried again.  Following protocol, I showed up at 4pm. Pizzeria Bianco opens at 5. I grabbed a beer next door, took a seat, and watched the growing crowd around me. A lady asked, \"Is there, um, an actual line?\"  A (from what I gathered) regular answered. \"Nope. It's on the honor system.\" And most honorably, the lady and her husband took their place behind the rest of us. I sat at the bar and ordered a caprese salad, a beer and a wise guy. It took a little bit to get my food, but it was nothing compared to the first wait. I chatted with a peculiar man who, when he told me he collected rocks and minerals, it didn't surprise me in the least.  My pizza arrived and I inhaled deeply. I snapped my obligatory picture and took a bite. Nice. Strangely enough, though the crust was crunchy in the right places and the fennel gave the sausage a great kick, it was the onions that did it. A smokiness had been imparted to the onions that came through in every bite. I should be embarrassed to say that I ate the whole thing, but I'm not. Suck it, Gluttony.  It wasn't until 24 hours later, though, that the full impact was felt. At that point, I was going to give a solid four stars, but dinner that next night changed that. Here I was in Atlanta's famed Rathbun's (whose executive chef/owner had actually beaten Bobby Flay at Iron Chef) and was nibbling on a very nice, much appreciated meal. But my mind kept wandering back to those smoky onions from the night before.   \"I miss those onions. I wonder what they're doing right now? I wonder if they think about me from time to time? Oh, that sounds so desperate. But maybe if I logged into Facebook, I could read onions' status. No, that's ridiculous. I'm sure those onions have moved on by now.  Onions, if you ever get the chance, call me!\"  I was eating food, created by a legit Iron Chef, and I was distracted by a pizza consumed hours earlier. If that doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what does.",

    "text": "Blah, blah, blah.... best pizza in the world.... Almost silly for me to write a review about Chris Bianco's Pizzeria, but here goes....  Kari and I cook at home, for ourselves and for groups, 5 or 6 days a week unless we're traveling. And we often cook even when traveling. Doesn't leave us much time for going out to eat. That said, our little group hits Bianco EVERY week. It's a ritual. One night a week, we go early, drink wine, get a grilled cheese or cheese plate, and wait... sometimes waaaaaaaaaaait. Knowing them doesn't get you in faster; in fact it might be a detriment. But it never disappoints. You really just have to make a night of it.  Tips for making a night of it:   - come with people you know & like. a first date there can be brutal!   - bring layers: if the wait is long, the weather can change.   - plan on drinking and getting snacks next door at Bar Bianco.   - bring games or other distractions: we're the idiots that bring mexican train dominoes or dice every week.   - when Sue quotes you a time, it's accurate. live it.   - make friends with the people who are waiting near you. some of them are in our foodie circle now. it's like a micro-YELP at the picnic table.  We've eaten pizza all over the country, all over the world... NYC, SF, Italy, Des Moines, IA & St Joe, MI... wherever! To say that one and only one pizza is the \"Best Pizza in the World\" is kind of ridiculous. But if I had to pick only one, last pizza, it would be Chris' Special - whatever he wants to make that night.  (disclaimer: i'm not gonna order the special tonight, i usually let everyone else do that and eat theirs. i'll order exactly what i want: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic. but IF it were my last pizza ever... the special. and that night, the special would probably be: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic).",

Not worth a 10 minute wait let alone the BS there.",

    "text": "I have had Pizzeria Bianco on my 'Must Go List' ever since the day I first heard of it. My only obstacle? I live in upstate NY. So recently I threw logic to the wind and drove the 2500 miles for pizza.  For those thinking now that I must be a raving lunatic there were some underlining reasons. I suffer from a debilitating disease and decided to take my children on a cross country adventure while I still can. Also them experiencing first hand a individual who is passionate about his work can only be a inspiring and positive thing in their young years. Or at least I hope so.  I guess I could go on and state how unique and great the pizza was. Or how the salads were made with the best ingredients available. Or how even the potato salad in the antipasto may be the best darn potato salad I ever tasted. I pretty much tried everything on the menu except one salad and found everything outstanding.  But I would prefer to address those who find it absurd to wait so long for pizza. I understand the puzzlement yet I believe they may tend to generalize it as just pizza. Which is not the case. Where in this country can you find people waiting outside for two hours in the blazing heat seem so happy? Strangers laughing and talking with each other, telling stories of past meals at Biancos to first timers. The joyous atmosphere was one of the first things I noticed and it was contagious. Once in the dining room nothing changed, people taking a step back, slowing down and enjoying great food and company. That in my view is what great food is all about.  Producing this type of magical atmosphere in a restaurant is extremely rare and can't be a easy task. But somehow Chris Bianco has and this may be the very reason why people are willing to wait. The truth is. It's more then just pizza.  Edited to add. Those who claim it is just pizza. As a chef I can tell you the test of True talent comes from taking a minimal amount of ingredients and making them shine.And without pristine ingredients it is nearly impossible to make something great if one is taking the minimalist approach. Chris Bianco's pizza's are every bit as good as Thomas Keller's Oysters and Pearls. And are harder to produce.",

    "text": "Bianco's is the best marketing ploy in the city, well except the Powerball. It is no wonder it consistently makes number one on the Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit) list. It should be taught as an example in Economics 101. How could seating for 30 at a time translate into a nationally famous restaurant?  Before I get to the nitty, let me make my disclaimer so all you potential flamers can chill and just move on your merry way. I don't wait. I want a reservation. I prefer an invitation by my host with RSVP. Bianco's is yet another example of our consumer need to suffer (see review of Los Dos) \"Seinfeld-style\" -- if you haven't seen the Chinese restaurant episode, you've got to; you can easily satisfy your need for suffering and you don't even have to leave your couch or wander far from your clicker.  I love Bianco's pizza. It truly reminds me of eating in Naples and what pizza is like from that region. I mean before their landfills filled up -- DON'T go to Naples now. There is no other place in Phoenix to taste this kind of pizza. I just wish someone could execute it better -- his wife?  Oh wait. I forgot; it already is the hottest restaurant in town. Why would they change a fantastically successful equation? Consumers consume. You want to find out why you have to wait 3 hours. You want to do it yourself. So does every tourist coming here to be surprised that Phoenix actually has paved roads and that we drive cars on them. They've booked their jeep tours from their suburban cookie-cutter somewhere far away, but don't realize that it's an hour drive to the desert. Yeah, you know that was you.  Do I have to remind you that you have to arrive at Bianco's an hour before the restaurant even opens to wait in line to put your name on the list to then wait next door for 3 hours to get a table? You will still have to wait because large parties get to eat ahead of you. I have to wonder. Would this place be so famous if they had seating for 100-120 like most other successful dining rooms around town? Would folks still flock there to spend their ENTIRE evening waiting for a table?  I'll wait and see. I've already fulfilled my duty as consumer and subjected myself to the suffering that is Bianco's. I've done it. What's next? Who's going to provide my next packaged-up roller-coaster ride? Come on. Tell me! Are we there yet? Yet?",

    "text": "Ok, the five stars is for the margherita pizza- wonderfully fresh and mild mozzarella combined with perfectly flavored sauce (not too much or too little) and fresh basil.  What I loved about this place was how fresh the ingredients were- the mozzarella is house-made every morning, and they were growing herbs outside in the front garden.  This reminded me of my favorite pizzeria (in NY), where they have their own herb garden- this is a must to get the freshest ingredients (which is why I laugh hysterically when I see a Pappa Johns commercial touting fresh ingredients- as if!).  I am a devoted brick oven fan- there is no pizza that comes close for me.  The crust is very thin and crispy here, just as it should be.  I would not even try to compare other styles like deep dish.  Other things worth noting: I had a slice of the onion pizza, and I didn't like it as much- it had no sauce, rendering it a little dry for my taste.  Also, we dined mi-afternoon to avoid crowds, and I wasn't able to order the anti-pasto, which was very sad (it's only available after 5pm).  I would have loved to have tasted some of that fresh mozzarella straight up.  Our waiter wasn't the best, but I don't really care that much, because I'm in heaven with delicious brick oven pizza.    So, if you appreciate the fine nuances of a good brick oven pizza, definitely check this out.  If you appreciate fresh ingredients and the subtle differences between house made, fresh mozzarella and store bought, check it out.",

We never have to worry whether they are going to miss us, as they have a very organized system and always let you know when your table is ready. The restaurant is small, warm, and cozy. The wait staff is super friendly. Here, simplicity is key. They are never over the top. There is a waiter who I believe is named Horacio who is very helpful and friendly. Pizzeria Blanco has contributed to some great memories and I will always go back knowing that I will have a great dining experience.",

We had reservations for 8p- we arrived at 7p (as was requested by the venue), and tried to keep cool at the very crowded and NON-air conditioned Bar Bianco next door- very quaint, but the overhead fans and open windows were laughable- funny that no one was laughing.  Yes, we arrived at 7p and were seated at 8:15 and glasses of water were quickly given.  Orders for salads and pizzas were taken fifteen minutes later.  Salads were on the table by 8:45p and pizzas around 9p.  (Hey, I was ready to eat at 7p, so yeah, I was watching the clock!)  I ordered the Farmer's market salad and the Rosa pizza (with parmigiano-reggiano, rosemary, red onion, and AZ pistachios).  Fantastic salad- tasted very fresh with a lovely vinaigrette- the shaved parmigiano-reggiano on top was the icing on the cake!  I'm a thin-crust lover and was impressed with the pizza crust here.  Loved the scent and flavor of rosemary, and the toasted pistachios really brought the flavors of the other ingredients together and made them pop!    The server we had was courteous and aimed to please, which was nice to see.  Chris Bianco looked quite busy, and yet was all smiles, tending to the oven- another cool thing to spy.",

The salads are very fresh, the pizza crust is perfect, some of the combinations, and the ingredients in general, are excellent. We waited about 15 minutes for a table at lunch, and it was worth that wait. For me, it would NOT be worth a 3 hour wait for dinner. My husband loved his Wise Guy with extra mushrooms (two things I don't care for so it's a treat for him), my Biancoverde was good, but my sister's Rosa was truly excellent. They are a bit pricey for pizza, but I guess when you have the rep, you get to charge for it.",

It's a great place to go since it's convenient and located next to museums and Arizona State University. You can also go for a walk and sightsee afterwards. The only difficult part was finding parking. If you don't mind valet, they have that service at the main entrance. If not, you have to locate a parking garage, street, or an empty lot.

When I mentioned that the crust was burned she said \"But it is a brick oven!\" as though she was trying to convince me that it is impossible to properly cook a pizza in a brick oven. Not once while we were there did anyone ask us how the food was. With no apology about the quality of the food the waitress walked away and brought the bill. The good news is that they comped the pizza.",

Great selection of beer and an excellent IPA on draft.   We ordered a Margherita and a Margherita with mushrooms and both were excellent. Simple, perfectly cooked and delicious.

    "text": "If your name is Chris Bianco, and you are destined to open up a nationwide sensation-of-a-pizza place in unexpected Phoenix, Arizona, you better make sure that your \"pizzeria bianco\" is good (and lives up to your surname and the name of your pizzeria). No worries, folks, Chris Bianco's white pizza is legit, and my favorite pizza on the menu at the quaint old-house location on Adams St.  I should know, after all - the supplier I was dining with made sure that we ordered one of every single pizza on the menu, as he was so passionate about Bianco, and wanted to make sure we understood the hype (which is definitely real). Everything about Pizzeria Bianco helps this place live up to its reputation as one of the top pizzerias in the nation: the cute, quaint brick building, the charming \"on the square\" location, the rustic nature of the romantic and intimate interior, the candlelit space, the open-view brick oven pizza, and the quality of the employees. Well, of course, the pizza speaks for itself as well.  There's a reason local Phoenicians (is that what people who dwell in PHX are called) recommend this spot to everyone that visits town. While they don't accept reservations, they were pretty lenient about our entire party of 8 not being present while allowing our partial party to occupy the largest table in the restaurant as the rest of us arrived.  We didn't waste any time once we had all arrived, and immediately, the change in mood from \"work day\" to \"relaxed dinner\" was palpable. We ordered two Antipasti platters, which were tasty enough, but obviously not the stars of the Neapolitan-style pizza show here at Bianco. Besides, I didn't want to spoil my appetite with salami and toasted bread while awaiting the mountains of pizza about to come within my reach!  On the current Adams St. location menu, there are 6 varieties of pizza. We started with one of each, and then ordered a second of our favorite pies. In the opening lines of my review, I mention that amazing white pizza: the 'Biancoverde.' You best believe we ordered and devoured two of those pies. Also outstanding was the 'Rosa,' with its delicious onions and unexpectedly awesome Arizona pistachios. Perhaps one of the most auspicious pies on the menu that really blew us away was the simple 'Marinara,' which is served without cheese. Yes, you read that right. Their marinara sauce, oregano, garlic, and crust are SO GOOD, that you really don't even need cheese for an authentic Neapolitan and awesome pizza experience. It kind of messes with your mind at first, and then you realize you've eaten the whole thing. I also recall the 'Wiseguy' being memorable for its fennel sausage!  Overall, everything we tried was fantastic, and we all had our favorites, but we also all concurred that the Biancoverde was a rightful namesake/bearer of the Bianco name.",

    "text": "I am a Foodie and pizza fan, and pizza and crab are my two favorite foods.  Pizzeria Bianco was the worst pizza I ever had in my life!  We ordered Sonny Boy pizza.  So Expensive, and hardly anything to eat.  My friend took the first bite.  As soon as her teeth sunk in, and she didn't chew yet, she said \"something's wrong with this pizza it tastes like spoiled milk\".   When I bit into it, she was right!   Smelled and tasted like spoiled milk or vomit.  Crust was very soggy and gooey that you could stir, had no form you could pick up with hands, have to scoop up with fork or spoon.  I was shocked how tiny the pizza was for the money, and they only had this one size.  We sent the pizza back.    First time in my life I ever sent a pizza back in my 63 years and not have it returned redone or baked longer.  We substituted and shared one $18 ravioli dish (no longer on their menu) at the waitress's suggestion, cos prices there were so expensive, I told her I wanted an entree with \"something more substantial that we could both share\".  The ravioli was just OK, quite bland, small serving, too.   Since my friend didn't wanna go to Pizzeria Bianco in the first place (I was so adamant cos I read the reviews and wanted to try their pizza and we were in the Camelback and 20th St area), I felt I could not make her pay for half of the dinner that was so awful.  She is on disability.  She had a $5 beer, so she paid $5 for the tip.  Of course we were still hungry but we had to be at a theater, and didn't want to spend more money for mediocre food, so expensive.    Dinner was so awful that I later called talked to Chris on the phone to give feedback.  He offered me a free meal, but I won't go back, because the things we ate were not worth it even for free, and I would not know what else to pick off the menu, it is not a large menu and portions are small.  We looked at other people's tables, at what they ordered.   I am glad Pizza Bianco has many 5 star fans, and my opinion won't make a difference, because restaurant owners say \"You can't please everyone!\"   That is True.  In case you are wondering, my favorite pizza in Phoenix metro is Mellow Mushroom's House Special, because of the crispy applewood smoked bacon in it, and I love combo pizzas.  Mellow Mushroom really packs on the ingredients and spreads to the edges, but the crust is not crispy and can never be made crispy the way I like it by baking it longer, probably because the dough ingredients.   I tried. But it is the kind of pizza that sticks in my mind.  Grimaldi has good pizza too, for me, anyhow.  I like thin CRISPY crust that crunches when you bite into it, and slice stays horizontal even 30 min after coming out of the oven.  I have not tried Cibo's.",

The market salad was very standard, just some greens with olives, and I would skip it unless you absolutely had to get some veggies.   The pizza crust itself was perfect. Thin but not hard and with a good chew. Really quite wonderful. Unfortunately I thought the toppings left more to be desired.  Marinara with Wood Roasted Mushrooms - I didn't feel like mushrooms were the best add on for the cheese-less marinara pizza. There were some slices of garlic mixed in the pizza to add some flavor, but the small slices of mushroom looked a bit sad among the wide expanse of marinara. Would recommend getting something more substantial on top.  Rosa with Prosciutto - This was a white pizza and the prosciutto was a really great addition to the pizza. It was pretty savory, and I enjoyed it despite not being the biggest fan of cheese. Preferred this to the marinara.  All in all, the pizzas were enjoyable enough, but I found myself somewhat bored and limited by the toppings. I wish they had some more creative toppings (with more veggies!). Check out their menu - if the pizzas on there look good to you, then you'd probably enjoy it - but if you're like me, and prefer more creative pizzas with a greater variety of toppings, then perhaps try your luck elsewhere.",

Make sure all of your party is present, otherwise you won't get seated. There is a nice little spot/bar to hang out at next door at while you're waiting for your table or group to arrive.   Inside the restaurant is dim and cozy. Warm ambiance to the place. Seating is available both indoor and outdoor. The service was ok for our group. We did however get our food really fast after ordering, which was kind of surprising.   The food was legit. We only had the pizza's, but they were as good as advertised. It's a little pricey (I think it was $18 for my pizza, the Sonny Boy), but it being so good kind of made up for it. Decent size to the pizza. If you're really hungry or can eat a lot, you may want to order an appetizer or dessert as well, as you may not get full on this. But for us, it was the right amount that night.   All in all, great pizza, great ambiance. Highly recommend this place!",

We arrived at about 4:45 on a Sunday, the wait was about 25 minutes which was fine. We sat down and in a 10 minute time frame we had 2 separate waitresses approach us to ask if we were ready to order about 3-4 times. We ordered our meals. Our salads arrived then our friends pizza. Their take was that it was too soggy to the point of flopping over. We waited a good 20 minutes thinking ours was still cooking. I reached out to one of the waitresses that had attempted to assist us previously who said \"It's normal for the pizza to take a bit longer to cook, it's a Sunday.\" (While our friends were nearly finished eating theirs). I then reached out to the other waitress who assisted us and she informed us that she never put the order in. There was no formal apology for the wait or the lie that the waitress provided us with originally. We had another waiter approach us afterwards to take our check only to let us know that our original waitress would help us.  Sound confusing? That's because it was. It was a strange experience and made it very apparent that no one communicated well.  I tried to give this place another go but was once again, not impressed. We will go to Pomo.   Bottom Line- Over priced pizza, lacks a wow factor, lack of communication between employees, unprofessionalism, misleading menu",

The food was excellent and the server was amazing but the hostess was terrible. She greeted us before entering and immediately let us know there was no room for our strollers before even asking if we even wanted to bring them in. We obviously didn't mind leaving our 3yr Olds stroller but we have a newborn....our kids are very behaved and bring them to MUCH more upscale restaurants with no problems so this was very unsettling. Not only was she rude about our kids but she just seemed pissed off to be there and we noticed how rude she was to every other guest since we were sitting close to the entry. Just some words of advice, your hostess is the guests first encounter when coming to your establishment, make it a good encounter.",

    "text": "Visited for the first time with 5 other friends. My 2 star review of this restaurant is only because of the service and attitude.  We had reservations and if they could have had us out of there in 30 minutes I believe they would have.  Waiter was by no means friendly. We started by ordering our drinks and appetizers. While enjoying our appetizers we were asked 5 times if we were ready to order our pizza. After enjoying what was a very good pizza our bill arrived (at this point we are one hour into our evening).  Some of us still had wine left and two in our party asked if they could have another beer.  The server said no. If you want more drinks you have to go next door to their bar....during the time we were finishing our wine they could have sold a couple of more beverages... There is a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more automatically added. Not an issue but with the not so friendly service and the pressure to eat and get out, made us all a bit bitter as a 20% tip was not warranted.  The credit card bill is a bit deceptive  so pay attention if your tip is automatically added.  It displayed the 20% tip amount,  below that is the food and beverage amount labeled as 'Total, below that is a line for more tip, and below that is the line for the 'Total' where you add .  It displays as if the tip has to be added to the 'total' dollar amount that is listed....however the 'total' for food and beverage included the tip.  One server told me yes I have to add the tip number to the total number..calculator confirmed this was not the case... Disappointing given we booked this weeks in advance for friends visiting from out of town.  We were out of there in one hour and twenty minutes and sadly by the end everyone was happy to be leaving.",

    "text": "My husband Matt B. and I love pizza, so when we decided to spend a weekend in Phoenix, Pizzeria Bianco was at the top of our to-do list. I'd heard great things about the pizza (which is a favorite of Nancy Silverton's of Pizzeria Mozza) and rather frightening things about the line (five hour wait times, what?) so Matt and I met up with our friend Stef P. at about 10:45 on a Saturday morning. By 11, when the doors opened, we were one of two parties waiting for a table. We saw no line the whole time we were here, so maybe massive wait times are a thing of the past.  The place was very charming, small and cozy, located in some kind of science center park that felt a bit like a college campus. Apple Maps did a shit job getting us to the right building, so we missed the free lot. Be advised that there is one, and that it's much closer than any metered parking. The restaurant felt like a new wave fancy pizzeria, with big ovens and a modern/rustic decor. Service was good, efficient and friendly.  We drank beer with our lunch (I forget what was on tap, but it was good), and enjoyed the excellent pizza. Stef and I shared the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy, while Matt had the Margherita. The pizzas were delicious, with flavorful crusts that were beautifully charred with a good amount of both crisp and chew. The toppings were high quality. The Wiseguy was probably my favorite, a white pie loaded with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. That sausage was so savory, that onion so subtly sweet. The Sonny Boy was also a winner, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives, meaty and full of flavor. I stole a bit of Matt's Margherita, and it was a top notch version of the classic pie, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  Now that I know Pizzeria Bianco comes with no hassle, I'll stop by whenever I come through Phoenix. The setting is nice, and the pizza hits the spot. Its reputation is well deserved.",

This pizzeria is a transplant right out of Italy with it's own wood oven right in the dining room. I love seeing pizzerias set up like that, it is just a lot of fun to watch them cook your pizza only a few feet from your table.   Prior to chowing down on pizza I had to order my first recommended dish, the Spiedini, Italian fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto. The wrapped cheese was then skewered and cooked to be served nice and warm. Probably better than the pizza, this dish may be the best thing I've eaten in Phoenix. The cheese was warm and creamy and the deliciously salty flavor was layered along side the crispy and salty sweet prosciutto. Often salt on salt is too much but this combo just worked perfectly and kept me coming back for more. If I hadn't already ordered my pizza I might have just went with a few more orders of the cheese and called it a day. It really was that good.  A few minutes after our appetizers, my pizza arrived. I broke my own rule and ordered a pizza without a red sauce because it was the other reccomended dish off my restaurant list. The Rosa pizza consisted of some of my favorite ingredients so I felt like it was ok to deviate from my norms. First it had a wonderful crust on which to build. Thin and crispy with a bubbly crust, but what would you expect from a super hot wood fire oven. The toppings started with cooked down red onions, and unlike Mr. Scott Conant, I love me some red onions. The bite of the onions was balanced out by the cheeses especially the fresh Parmesan. The last topping and by far the least likely on a pizza were the pistachio nuts. The great thing is that I love pistachios also! All of these ingredients mixed together on a pizza created a depth of flavor that made me happy to have taken the risk. I would definitely reccomend this pizza to people who want to stray from the norm but in the end the prosciutto wrapped fontina skewers significantly out shined the pizza.  Overall our meal at Pizzeria Bianco was a memorable one.  Not much I could complain about. The service was good, the ambiance was like most pizzerias and the food was on point. I could eat that appetizer every day, too bad I don't live nearby. Next time you are in town and want some quality pizza on the western side of the country, check out Pizzeria Bianco.  Overall Review: 7/10",

And they are from LOCAL farmers. He makes his own cheese and bread.  The waitstaff rocks. Dave and Moe are the two that we have dealt with over the years (yes, I said years) and they are like a well-oiled machine.  Unfortunately, Chris isn't cooking the 'za anymore due to his asthma. :( But, he still has his fingers in the pie, so-to-speak. His brother (they look just alike!) has taken over the helm at the fantastic pizza oven they use.  Please realize... there is a long wait for a reason. Don't let that scare you away. It is worth the wait!!! Go with friends, get a drink next door, and just hang out and chill while you wait. You won't regret it!  Also, try his other place called Pane Bianco! Best sandwiches in town!!!  PIZZERIA BIANCO IS THE BEST IN PHOENIX!!! HANDS DOWN!!!  Dang! Now I'm hungry for some Pizzeria Bianco!",

    "text": "Ok, I like a lot of different types of pizza, so to say this is my favorite pizza in the world is hard to do. I have had a million pizza's in Italy, Chicago, New York, all the best pizza places.   This is my favorite pizza. And my favorite restaurant. DO NOT GO HERE ON A FIRST DATE. You have to love the one you're with. Because you have to be patient. You can't get out of it. You will spend 2 and a half to 5 hours with them.   The first time I went, I was not aware of the state of wait. So I drank at the amazingly cute bar next door. And drank. And drank. Drunk me shoved pizza topped with pistachios down my throat. Drunk me ranted and raved about how amazing the pizza was, but drunk me doubted my alcohol induced review.   So I went back, socialized more, didn't chug my wine, and enjoyed my company. The pizza was even better. The crust will satisfy any \"type\" of pizza lover. It is hard to explain the consistency, but I am sure it has something to do with the really neat wood burning, brick made fire going in the corner.   Some people want fast food, they don't like long lines, they think the wait is ridiculous. So here are our options.   1. They go to reservations only. All of a sudden, normal people like us don't even get to ever try this place.  2. They make a chain. Quality goes down cause the man himself ain't makin' the pies.  3. They build a new restaurant. BOOM. Ambiance gone, atmosphere screwed, screaming kids everywhere cause the wait is short enough to tote the young ones with... Boo.   Deal with it, enjoy it, because there is no where else in town you will be able to tell people that you waited for a table for 5 hours and IT WAS WORTH IT!",

    "text": "Went here last night for dinner with some friends, and must admit that the food lived up to the hype.  We drove there separately and surprise - now they offer FREE valet parking (of course tip the valet dude).  Our quoted wait time for a table was 1.5 hours, and apparently this was nothing compared to the wait my friends had to deal with before (3+ hours).    We spent time next door at the bar by ordering a bottle of wine and a cheese plate to share and before we knew it, the wait was over.  Although the restaurant isn't big (and we were almost friends with the tables next to us just because it was so snug in there), there was a nice ambiance - especially with the huge woodfire oven in the back.    We ordered two Caprese salads and three pizzas - the Margherita, Wiseguy, and Biancoverde (we added roasted tomato slices to the Biancoverde for an extra charge).  O.M.G. - the food was SO good!  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  I'm usually not a fan of pizzas with thin crusts, but these were awesome.  Apparently they make their own mozzarella, which is probably why their Caprese salad ($9) is one of the best (if not the best) I've had thus far.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were sliced thick and tasted SO fresh, the basil was fragrant - and EVOO - YUM!   The Magherita pizza was $12 and the other two were $16 each.  Our food came within 15-20 mins after we placed our order, and boy - the pizzas were so fragrant!  They were decently sized and were enough to feed our group of six ladies.  The Margherita and Biancoverde tasted good, but my fave was the Wiseguy, which was topped with thick slices of roasted onions, mozzarella, and thick slices of fennel sausage.  The sausage tasted a bit too sweet, but overall, each bite of the pizza slice was food nirvana.  My friend ordered a Wiseguy to go, so the bill (2 salads + 4 pizzas) came to $88, and we added a 20% tip to that.  Was the food worth the total bill?  Yes!  Will I come here again?  Yes!",

Guess that's why they couldn't put a few more toppings and cheese on it the crust would not support it.  Had just a dab of sauce on it which they are known for and couldn't taste it.  Yes it was fresh but for the price certainly not worth it, probably had 50 Cents worth of topping on a $18.00 pizza.    Wonder if James Beard got the same pizza's we were served.  I agree with another viewer that they need more help, if your going to wait a hour and a half at their \"outdoor bar\" the least you could have better service and not just left there waiting. He's one smart cookie making a lot of money on a really cheap pizza with a few fresh ingredients on it.  People wake up you can buy a really nice meal for $18.00! '",

We tried one of every pizza - all were delicious with unique, yet not super crazy toppings. The Rosa and the Wise Guy were my favorites - again, with toppings that are pretty typical (Ok pistachios are not that typical), but presented and mixed in a way that made the eating experience great!

    "text": "I was able to complete the Bianco Trifecta (Pane, Bar, and Pizzeria) in one day and despite having to wait 3 hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco it was totally worth it!  This was probably the best pizza I've had outside Naples.  WAIT TIME - 3 HOURS: -- AC and I arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Bianco opens at 5pm and there was already a good sized line.  Bar Bianco next door opens at 4pm, so you could go in and get drinks while you wait in line.  Some people even brought lawn chairs like they were out for a tailgate or a picnic.  Once the place opened and they started taking names they said it would be a 2 hour wait. -- After wandering around downtown for a while we headed to Bar Bianco for some wine, apps, and a game of chess.  An excellent way to pass the time. -- The staff at Bar Bianco came by and told us our table was ready, right about 7pm.  1hr to put our names in + 2 hours to wait = 3 hours total waiting time.  FOOD - OUTSTANDING: -- Spiedini, $10 - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm.  What a way to start a meal!  Served on skewers, this is an amazing appetizer.  The cheese was melty without dripping everywhere and the warm prosciutto was excellent. -- Salad, $6 - Local Organic Greens with Red Wine Vinaigrette.  Pretty standard, mixed green salad. -- Margherita Pizza, $13 - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil.  This is why you come here, and it lived up to expectations.  The crust was perfectly chewy with a bit of char and flavor from the brick oven.  The crust alone would make a great dish.  The tomato sauce had the right amount of tang, wasn't too sweet, and they didn't drench the pizza in sauce.  The mozzarella was excellent and the basil was out of this world.  Better than anything you could grow in your own garden. -- Salami and Olive Pizza, $16? - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, and Kalamata Olives.  There was no skimping on the toppings here.  First class, quality ingredients and plenty of it.  If you like cured meats this is the way to go.",

The date I was with was a 6'5 and 250 lb man and we felt pretty uneasy sitting at a 2 chair mini table squeezed between two other couples. The service was great though and the waiter was very attentive. I am mixed about this place b/c food and service were 4 stars but just too squished for my taste. Something you should at least try once though!",

The ingredients on the pizza are fresh, many imported and the crust coming out of the wood burning oven absolutely lives up to all the hype.  The olive oil, prosciutto, parmesan cheese and tomatoes will take you back to Italy.  The staff was friendly and didn't rush us although their official closing hour is 10pm.",

    "text": "So I should say this is the first Yelp review Ive written, why wait so long, honestly I just finally got fed up. Thats all really im fed up with the bullshit that is dining in the US right now. Strip malls and fashionable destinations with staff that could stand in for most prison guards. Chefs that all act like little princesses when you tell them their food isnt that great. Everyone lavishing them with accolades they dont deserve because well generally I feel tastebuds are broken and most individuals dont know any better. Biancos is a perfect example.  First the staff. Listen youre 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 years old. Get over yourself, youth and looks fade and the last thing you want is for someone to wish they fade quickly on you because of your attitude problem. The staff here is lets say less than stellar. Fuck lets say they are less than mediocre. I hate seeing waitstaff texting, i just cant stand it. You have nothing to do, find something. We went in tonight and it was ridiculous, the waitress/hostess didnt say fourteen words to my wife and I. No friendliness, no inviting vibe, it was like her getting my coke was the worst thing she had ever done in her life. Judging by just the way she looks, saturday in that bathroom at Crescent Ballroom was probably worse, just saying if you dont want people to judge a book by its cover, dont put yourself out there. Put your phone away, be more attentive, act like you appreciate me keeping you employed. I cant believe I tipped you well, I shouldnt have tipped you at all.   Second the pizza, are you kidding. Its the second time Ive been here and I thought the first time, it must be me. Its not, there is nothing stellar about this pizza. The dough itself I got a cramp chewing, is that a good thing? Seriously is it, cause if it is I dont know what to say. My jaw still hurts its been 2 hours and I have an iron jaw. The fennel sausage it was good, really flavorful, someone cared there for sure. The cheese, meh, not stellar. The pizza overall lacked salt, a common theme here in the valley. Maybe we dont have salt out here in the kitchens. Margharita pizza, meh, sauce meh, cheese super meh, dough my jaw hurts, basil the two pieces meh. So what is so special about Biancos? Im sick of people pulling the wool over everyones eyes. I just cant stand it. I dont like when it happens and its like lemurs heading toward the cliff. Am I the only one thats looked up and gone, wait somethings not right here.  Youre telling me people wait hours for this food? Its utility pizza at best. Before you come back with a retort and all readers know this. I dont care what you have to say. I dont want to hear it, you simply dont know what you are talking about. Im not impressed by brick and mortar walls and fire oven pizza. Ive had way better in a hole in the wall. My jaw hurts seriously and I have a super strong jaw. Listen if it was good, id say it. Andreollis is amazing and those croissants best Ive had here, France, anywhere. The best period. There are other things I can say that about. Biancos pizza not one of them. Ive had the same style, the same margharita with less attitude on staff and way less expensive. I just cant believe everyone says this is the best. It makes me sad really. Is it good, yeah, will I go back, probably not. Is it the best in the US definitely not and I feel horrible even being a diner right now subjected the the opinions of mediocre critics. I just dont know how this place climbed and stayed atop the mountain. Its ridiculous. Id give it a two stars really but you can tell whoever the figurehead is they are really trying to do something special. im fine with that but the expectation here is much higher as much as everyone hypes the place. If it wasnt overhyped it probably would have gotten four but my expectation was perfection both times and both times I might as well have gotten a slice it would have given me the same satisfaction.",

We happened to be in the vicinity one weekend evening and walked up to get a table -  the hostess informed us the wait was over 4 hours long! And lady was not so friendly either!! We walked right out. Then maybe a year later we managed to get takeout from Pizzeria Bianco on another trip to the area and finally tried the pizza. It was good I have to say, but not worth 4 hours wait good. But then I do wonder....what pizza will be worth wasting 4 hours for?  I guess I need to try it on a weekday for lunch to really get the full taste of this pizza. One day....",

And some of you may think that's silly, but let's not forget, they could have outdoor seating, and they have a whole bar- in which they refuse to serve you pizza. You can only get pizza in one special area, and until then, buy lots of drinks. I think it's a great business plan, but not my favorite eating plan.",

The stepped parapets above the Pizzeria Bianco sign hide the pitched-truss roof line overhead. Just below, segmented windows form a frame around the centralized entryway. These windows can be open. In the interior, the trusses are exposed and the Phoenix brick is extraordinary. The focal point being the wood fired oven.  Sitting at the bar where I could see a specific table and remembered the wonderful evening, dining with my guest. It has been many years since we shared that cozy table near the back but easily remember the glasses of red and a great pizza.  Today for me here, one excellent beer on draft.

The antipasto plate ($13) was fine, with a couple pieces of cheese, olives, peppers, a frittata and salami, but it wasn't any better than what I've had at my current favorite downtown Phoenix pizza place, Cibo.  In fact, Cibo beat Bianco in pizza quality (Cibo doesn't burn the edges) and in wait time. My party of four waited more than an hour for a table at Bianco's, and I don't think I've ever waited more than 30 minutes at Cibo on a busy Friday or Saturday night.  I ordered a margherita pizza topped with olives ($15), and I did enjoy the thin, soft middle of the pizza. It was similar in taste and portion size to Cibo but had that not-so-appetizing burnt crust.  The atmosphere at Bianco's was bare bones, and it was way too loud in the place to be considered romantic. Cibo, on the other hand, offers a gorgeous patio and a quieter setting.  I liked that Pizzeria Bianco was in the historic downtown area and was close to several bars, including the Rose and Crown Pub (628 E. Adams St.), but in the future I'll stick with Cibo for a quality pizza fix.",

Plus, they offer a free economics lesson on handling high demand and low supply.  You can either raise the price, or ration the goods.  Prices are reasonable here, but you have to wait.  But the waiting can be pleasant at the bar next door, with a comfortable seat on the porch, a glass of wine and some olives to nibble on.

Chef Chris my original review was 5 stars, your rude employees have dropped it down to 1.  If youre looking for a more upscale, gourmet, thin-crust style pizza, youve found it here! After I placed my order, they served me a few slices of bread with olive oil, which was delicious! So much so, that I bought a loaf to take home, they actually sell fresh bread here as well. I ordered a Handmade Mozzarella Salad as an appetizer, fresh flavorful tomatoes with high quality mozzarella slices and fragrant fresh basil. However, they need to drain the mozzarella cheese a bit before making their salad, it was sitting in a pool of water. I didnt wait long for my Margherita pizza with salami, it arrived just in time and piping hot from their brick oven.  I ordered a diet Coke and was a bit surprised when a Mexican soda in a bottle arrived. Which is fine, but its an Italian place, so I expected regular soft drinks or maybe Italian sodas, not Mexican diet Coke which was possibly expired due to the lack of flavor. However, even this was promptly remedied with an iced tea from the friendly and helpful staff. The wait staff was very attentive, and the whole place seemed to light up when the owner arrived wearing his white culinary garb. The prices are justified when you consider the quality...",

    "text": "OK, after all the buzz of this place, I finally made my way in there. Let's be honest, back in the day there was a 3 hour waiting line. I only would wait for 3 hours in the ER if I'm bleeding more than half gallon per hour, but never for food and furthermore never for pizza.  So now that things have settled a little bit, it was my time to visit the place. In my crew there were 4 kids although the place is far from kid friendly, and so is the service. Anyhow, let's cut to the chase.  The menu, although small, has a good selection. The antipasto was good with one meat, one cheese, some cauliflower, red pepper, olives and a couple of other things. It was good and a nice portion.  I also had the caprese salad but I really missed some balsamic vinegar. The EVOO was tasteful but some balsamic is a must (in my opinion).  I also had the rosa pizza. The parmesano raggiano flavor dominates in a super pleasent way. I would recommend people to share because the whole thing (with the same flavor) is a little too much. Don't take me wrong, I loved this pizza but maybe would like to taste something else as well.  They don't have deserts besides a biscotte that was good and I had a double capuccino  that was good as well.  One thing I didn't like is that they don't have lemonade. WTH? I was craving an Arnold Palmer to fight the heat back but had to settle with an ice tea.  Anyways, great food, the place worth it if you don't have to wait, nice ambiance and the neighborhood is nice for a walk after the feast.  I might go back some day soon to try other pizzas.",

    "text": "First off I must say I have been wanting to try this place for years. I have heard that it is the best pizza in the country! Has been on a few tv shows and is on everybodies must eat list. As I happen to be in the Phoenix area I set out to finally give this place a try. Warned that there maybe an hr or two wait I was determined to have the best pizza in the country. Get there around noon on a beautiful Saturday day. No line, walked right in. Great start. Order some drinks and a few pizzas. Prices seemed kinda steep but for the best pizza in the world I would pay double. My party of 3 and I are very excited about this pizza until it arrives at our table. Both pizza are kinda small and look very basic. Everyone at the table are looking around at each other like what the hell is this? Don't worry, it must taste unbelievable right? Wrong! There is nothing special about this pizza. It didn't taste bad. It just didn't taste good. You can tell they use fresh ingredients but so do I at home. If this place is considered a pizza mecca than maybe I should open a pizza restaurant because I make a far better pizza than this.   Very disappointed by this place. It was like meeting my hero and was disappointed he was just a normal guy. I so wanted to like this place as this place is a legend in the pizza world. A $90 bill later and I would have rather had pizza hut says a lot. Just left and already thinking about where to eat next as I am still hungry. Dont believe the hype. You have been warned.",

    "text": "Initially when I wrote on my fb status \"Hey I'm traveling to Phoenix, Arizona, do you guys have any restaurant recommendations\" the general consensus from everyone is to go to Pizzeria Bianco. I looked it up and saw all the rave reviews about this place and the warning to new customers that you will expect to wait at least an hour or 2 to get a table in this place. BUT, if everybody's mama and mama's mama is raving about this place, I have to go right?! The waitress took down our names and gave us a buzzer letting us know it will be about a 1 1/2 hour wait. Okay.. no surprise.. we expect that we will be waiting a long time. So we walk next door to their bar area which looks like it used to be a house and snag a seat outside in the patio. You can grab a drink or two while waiting for a table. Finally the buzzer goes off, \"SWEET.. now we could eat!\" We immediately know what to order. The Mozzarella is supposed to be handmade was delish.. very fresh and goes naturally well with the sweet steak tomatoe and olive oil. Our pizzas finally arrive which we ordered the mozzarella with sausage and basil pizza. Pizza dough was chewey and not too thick or thin. It kind of reminds me of LA's Urbano Pizza or a lot of these fancy gourmet pizzeria places but if you ask me if it is worth 2+ hours of wait time to get fancy pizza? UMmm.. probably not. I think I would go at least once if you are new to Phoenix and you want to just go for the experience. But I definitely think Mother Dough in Los Angeles, California is way better... minus the crazy wait time.. . Come to LA, and you will know what I am talking about. =)  *FYI: Place is about a few blocks, walking distance from the Phoenix Convention Center.",

It was about 5:30 and they said the wait was 2 hours (!), so we walked around downtown instead of waiting for a table *at their own bar next door*. When we came back they'd bumped us (drawn a line through our name and put us lower on the page) and said the wait would be an hour and once again \"we were welcome to wait at their bar next door\". They must walk over and announce names? Why not take our phone number or give us one of those buzzers?   I'm sure the pizza is wonderful but the scam of waiting nearly all evening at their bar isn't acceptable. What a shame that a place of such renown has such contempt for its patrons.",

Next day we went for lunch instead. $16 for a medium thin crust pizza is not quite worth it: not enough cheese, just a few slices of sausage. Salad is even worse. A few leafy lettuce with 6 olives. Cost: $6. I can buy a bag of same lettuce from 99 Cent store and can divide into 10 plates! Tables and chairs are old, made of wood only. They are not comfortable. The place is small. Waiters are in 50's, not very friendly. Don't go. I am sure many still want to give it a try simply because it is in historic Heritage Square. Talk about a sucker born every minute!",

The 'Best Pizza in the World' is in Phoenix?\"  Well, I haven't been around the world, so I can't say, but what I CAN say is that the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is outstanding.  My brother just visited but was only here on a Sunday, and he was very upset they weren't open because he had been looking forward to returning for months!  It's usually pretty busy - you might get lucky and be seated immediately, but be prepared to wait.  I've tried four of their pizzas and they are all outstanding.  The dough is probably the best I've ever had, the combination of flavors is simple and powerful, the sausage is exquisite (made specifically for the restaurant), and the prices are outstanding for the quality of the food.  It's a place that I will treasure taking visitors, very conveniently located downtown (though parking can be tough in the small lot immediately adjacent).  Best in the world?  Possibly - certainly worth deciding for yourself!",

It's OK, not great, but it's not like there aren't other wood-fired pizza joints in Phoenix.  By the way, I know real Italian pizza. I eat it regularly. In Italy. So don't give me crap about, 'go eat at Domino's, you don't know good pizza.' I do. Believe me. I cook Italian (tuscan) regularly.  Pizzeria Bianco approaches traditional Italian pizza, so I'd ordinarily give it 3 stars. However I downgraded it to one due to the rude, rude, rude service and how incredibly overpriced it is.  Gotta hand it to Bianco though, he's got a good scam going. I mean, he's really got it figured out. Hype the shit out of the place, bribe/suck up to all the restaurant reviewers who convince the sheeple that you gotta go here if you're 'somebody', brown-nose the local celebrity crowd into coming there (I'm sure they get treated much differently than us peons), make the restaurant too small and get people to spend money at your wine bar while enduring the insane wait for a table.

    "text": "I'm somewhat new to Arizona, so when relatives from out of town said they had heard of this place on the Food Network and knew what they needed to do to get in, I figured why not?  We get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00, when the place opens. There is a small valet lot (full) and a public parking garage ($12.00) which the restaurant will validate (only $9.00, though, you still have to cough up $3.00). Our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside. Inside, the restaurant is teeny-tiny, with maybe six tables that seat four or more, a few tables that seat two, and a bar area where people can eat. The bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies' toilet did not flush properly.   I scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that's it. So if you have any dietary restrictions you're pretty much f*cked. While we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table. THREE?!??! and they WEREN'T the first in line either! WHAT?   Bread comes and it is homemade and delicious, with a crispy-outside, spongy-inside thing going on, and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles (don't know how else to so eloquently put it). Then drink refills come. No one else is being served (so they fire up these orders TO order, not bad, okay). I didn't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil, huge slices of tomato for the caprese. Kalamatas on the baby greens salad.   Pizza comes out, finally! $12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust. The four-cheese was great; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses. Arugula on top. A couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them. Too salty (and I LOVE salt so yeah, that's saying a lot if even I am critical on that point). One pizza's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it. But it's food so it can't be perfect every time now can it.   A table of two finished/paid/left. They were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened, and there was still a shitload of people outside. Meaning that if you don't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00, the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 (and that's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table).   Here's where it gets tricky - we paid, but were finishing our drinks. We were NOT the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who hadn't left yet. And after paying $150 for PIZZA (give me a break, please) the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because \"people waiting outside are getting upset.\" Hey, I can see how that sucks for them but we're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long. When we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us (and everyone else who was leaving) DIRTY looks. Bitch please - it was YOUR decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line, for one. For two - the food isn't that great anyway. Would I ever come here again? Hell no would I ever wait in a line that long for ANYTHING, not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats. Oh, and I woke up twice in the middle of the night feeling like my face was caving in on itself and had to get up to go drink water.",

If you have more than 1 hostess let me narrow it down for you, short dark hair and glasses. I myself am a business owner and no matter how great your product is, amazing customer service is also an integral part of the the overall experience. I have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long.  Back to the night at hand. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dining elsewhere in hopes of grabbing a pie to enjoy the next day. We were holding the door open for those that were exiting, those that were being ushered in to their seats and those that were putting their name on the waiting list. When there was a lull said hostess says \"Yes?\" Not, \"How may I help you?\" or \"Hi\" or anything that could be consTrued as gracious, friendly, hostessish. My boyfriend states that we were looking to get a pizza to go. Miss Crab-Apple, my new moniker for her, states, no haughtily sniffs, \"We don't DO orders to go when there are people waiting.\" Then she turns and walks away. She doesn't even ask us if we want to put our names down for a table.  Mr. Bianco we didn't know what your kitchen's policy is for takeout, maybe you should have a sign that is in huge letters right on the door: NO TAKEOUT WHILE OTHERS WAIT! I am sure that would clear it up for those of us that simply wanted to spend our money on your food, just not eat it there.   Thank you for your time,  D'Lisa Shayn",

You can chill in the little house next to it or in the front and booze it up a bit before you dine.    The place is the real deal though.  It's all done by Bianco, the ingredients are fresh and some local.  The attention to detail and quality is superb.  The flave, well it is monumental.  All the listed pizzas are legit Italian style or artfully put together.    I wasn't surprised one bit that it was the Bomby McBomb.",

    "text": "OK, I have been here 3 times since I've moved to the Valley and I feel as though I am finally ready to review it. I've been once on a date, once with a friend who was visiting, and most recently with two friends who were born and raised here but never had the opportunity to go. Oh, and they brought their little baby girl. The third time, the charm as I will begin to refer to it, we waited about an hour and thirty minutes.  The place is a gem. There atmosphere inside the restaurant is intimate and homey. You can see Chris Bianco making the pizzas himself behind the counter and can smell the fire from the wood burning oven. We were greeted by the one and only waiter who is originally from Chicago. He's worked with Bianco for like 13 years, he said.   We ordered a bottle of wine and three pizzas for us to share. My two fav pizzas from Biancos are the Rosa and the Margharita. The Marg only has sauce and garlic so I added mushrooms. The Rosa has no sauce, cheese, pistachios, and crack. Seriously, the Rosa...I could eat it everyday. The crust is very thin and not heavy. If you're crazy about crust, you won't think this pizza is as amazing as I do. The sauce, I think, is what makes the pizzas so great. Not only that, but the fresh ingredients that are used make the pizza taste just that much better.  Yes, there is a long wait but it's an experience. After 3 bottles of wine shared between three of us (my Mommy friend was being good), we had such a great time chatting it up with our server and enjoying each others company. Why not wait an hour or so for good pizza when it's not anymore expensive that a fully loaded, greasy large pizza from Dominos?  The wine selection is good. The pizza is great. The service is stellar. If you don't want to wait in the wine bar for drinks, they'll call you over from the Rose and Crown bar across the way. It'll save you a couple bucks, too.",

Came here on a recommendation of a pizza nut (who for the record is born, raised and spent her entire life in New York, so she knows her pizza).   Definitely the California style of pizza more so than the new york style, and since i was moving from california to new york at the time, I was still all about CA style food. Have had very similar pizza in Berkeley at Cheeseboard, as well as A16 in San Francisco, so this style pizza is certainly not new to me. I don't think it was the best of this kind i've ever eaten (A16 gets that) but still very very good.   There was an hour wait when we showed up so we saddled over to the wine/beer bar next door (genius!) and had some really good local arizona beers. really good beers. i wish i remembered what they were called cause they were probably the best over my entire roadtrip.  Got seated in super cosy trattoria. Had pizza with sausage, cheese and arugula, very good. Great bottle of wine too.   If i ever end up in Phoenix again (god i hope not), i am coming straight here.",

    "text": "The critics say it's the one of the best pizza places in America.  The consumes love it....Believe all the hype!!!!  Visiting the Phoenix,Arizona area, I heard from my family that this was a the spot to be at, but unfortunately reservations were few and far between, and waiting time is anywhere between 3-4 hours long. Wow, that long for pizza? Eh...I think not.  If you have been following me, I'm not even that much of a pizza fan.    But, they twisted my arm, and not one to turn down a new place, I agreed.    We drove to downtown Phoenix and got there around 4 pm in the afternoon.  This restaurant is situated in a little square, it looking more like a wooden house with other businesses situated in that square with the same decor and landscape.  We were told that the wait time was about 4 hours long.  Wow, no kidding, is this a joke?  Okay April, be a good sport.  The group agreed to wait, and we decided to go around the other little nearby pubs.    First spot was the pub across the way.  Although I'd never been to England, this seemed like an upscale pub that belonged across the pond.  Very homey and warm, it had a brown decor and accompanying fireplace.  Place is small, but quaint, and lots of beers on tap.  One hour spent here  Second spot was the wine bar situated kitty corner to the pub. Same size as the pub, but decor was different, with more of a modern feel and touch.  We had some appetizers, and some wine. All equally good, and it tided us over to our well anticipated meal.  They have a nice selection of wine, and staff are eager to give their recommendations. Another hour spent here.  Third spot was area directly outside of Pizzeria Bianco.  They had very long wooden picnic tables, and above us were white lights strung up.  There were bushes and lots of greenery, and I later found out from a Foodnetwork special, that the chef keeps his garden out here to ensure fresh quality items.  Magnificent! Yet another hour spent here....  Final spot was Pizzeria Bianco.  We started off with some caprese salad, and with the size of our group, ordered 2.  It was THE BEST caprese salad ever, the mozzarella clearly fresh and maybe made homemade, and the tomatoes weren't mushy, just the right texture.  The drizzed balsamic was not too tart, and had the preferred amount of olive oil, also drizzled  For pizzas, we ordered everything on their menu.  But the two that stand apart are the Rosa, with crushed pistachios and red onion, it had both a nice bite and a nice kick.  The second was the Wiseguy with onion, mozerella and fennel sausage.  Phenomenal! The sausage had a great savory flavor, leaving you satisfied, but not like you stuffed yourself silly with a Chicago deep dish.  I'm still trying to find that type of sausage in Chicago. No luck yet.    Come here for the ambience and food.  It is definitely worth the wait, as it will spark up some rather interesting conversations during your long, but very worthy visit.",

    "text": "This rating is based on the terrible customer service we experienced with the manager that was working the day (11/30) we tried to eat there.  We arrived around 4pm and went to the bar next door (Bar Bianco) because we didn't want to eat til 5:30 ish.  We had a wonderful experience at the bar; the bartender was very friendly, the ambiance is nice, and the wine and beer were tasty.  Around 5 I walked next door to the pizzeria and told the manager I needed seating for 2, she said it would be around 30 minutes and she put me down on the waiting list, I told her I would be next door.  About 30 minutes went by and another employee from the restaurant came over to see who was waiting for a table.  I informed her we had put our name in about 30 minutes prior, she said she would check and get back to me.  Another ten minutes passed and I ended up walking over to find out what the hold up was.  I again spoke with the manager whom acted as if I was bothering her and in a condescending tone she told me my name was on the list and she would let me know when something became available.  Meanwhile there were at least 6 open seats at the bar and 3 empty tables inside.  I went back to the bar and waited another 10 minutes before returning to the restaurant.  When I walked in, the restaurant was about 2/3rd's full but there was plenty of outdoor seating.  The manager told me there was still a wait of about 5 minutes, I expressed to her that we had been waiting for at least 50 minutes at this point and while we wanted to sit inside, I asked her if we could sit outside.  She said we could and told me the bartender was supposed to offer us that option.  Seems to me a good manager would have taken responsibility for being in charge of the operation and that if you have clients waiting to be seated and you have seating available you would get those patrons seated, not put it off on the bartender.  Finally we sit.  At this point the restaurant is probably half full.  The waitress promptly  takes our order and she never comes back.  Ten minutes pass with no food and no update from the waitress.  I finally flag down another employee and tell him to cancel the order cause now we are out of time and have to get to the airport.  From my perspective of what happened that day and reading the reviews here of how this place is supposedly legendary, the only conclusion I could come to is they are famous now and really don't care about the customer experience.  At least that is how I felt the manager acted and how we were treated.",

And that's what Bar Bianco next door is for. Italian wine, home-made Italian bread and a small cheese platter (all with very reasonable prices) made 2 hour waiting seem only like 45 minutes.  The pizzas are definitely worth waiting for. All are made by the owner, chef Chris Bianco himself. We ordered 4 different types, from Wiseguy (wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, a bit spicy fennel sausage), BiancoVerde (everyday freshly made mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta and Arugula) to salty Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami and Gaeta Olives). Let me just say, for someone who could care less about pizza, I would definitely come back again in 2 weeks for these pizzas, accompany with their delicious Italian wine collection.  - Reservations are only accepted 1 month in advance, and only for group of 6-10 people - According to my friend, if you have left over, don't microwave it! Warm it up on the stove instead. - Because of its small size, this place is not the best choice for large group",

Super delicious, but be careful, it can be a bit salty due to the amount of thinly sliced and baked to perfection salami.  Salty and delicious.  But by far, the star of the show is the crust.  Its chewy, crunchy, baked just right in the brick oven and absolutely delicious.  The service was friendly, the location is only a short walk away from the light rail station (5-7 min) and is in a sort-of gated off little alcove surround by other bars and small restaurants, right in the back of the Phoenix Science Museum.  Definitely recommended, and would go again next time I stop by Phoenix.",

We got there at about 4:00, and  still ended up waiting for over two hours, but the bar next door is such a cute place to wait.  We curled up on a couch and drank several glasses of wine.  The whole set-up sort of forces you to slow down and enjoy the company of the people you're with... which is good when you're with someone you enjoy spending time with!  I have to say, the pizza itself is very good (and once you get a table, the service is FAST)!  The menu doesn't offer many choices, but it doesn't need to.  You come for the pizza, and that's what you get.  Overall, we had a very fun, somewhat romantic experience.",

    "text": "Due to a jury duty appointment, we found ourselves in the heart of Phoenix last Thursday afternoon.  Since we live in Peoria, a trip downtown for lunch is just not feasible.  So, we decided to attempt lunch at Pizzeria Bianco.  I consider myself a bit of a foodie and have heard that this place has the some of the best gourmet pizza in the country.  I've heard the stories of lines for hours, just to get a chance to taste these creations.  With that much hype, I was expecting to be disappointed.  I WAS NOT!  My wife and I shared their fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  I've been eating fresh, homemade mozzarella for years and have found that I like mine with a bit of a salty bite.  Theirs is very creamy in texture, with good flavor, but not enough salt for me.  As I reached for the salt shaker, I found that in the shaker was not your plain old iodized salt but sea salt!  Color me impressed.  The salad was as fresh as could be and we both enjoyed it.  For our pizza, we chose the Biancoverde pizza, a white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta and arugula.  Despite having a classic, peppery bite when eaten alone, the arugula added a different texture and a bit of sweetness to the pizza.  The combination of cheeses was perfect.  With a bit of homemade bread to start, the salad and pizza, we left very content.  I can honestly say that Pizzeria Bianco lived up to the hype.  When I'm downtown, this will be my first choice for lunch.",

    "text": "Our wait was five minutes, arriving at 4pm on a Friday and opting to sit at the bar. I hadnt been here in probably 14 years.    Both pizzas were a little disappointing. Very good certainly, but not out of this world. I still remember chomping into my first Wiseguy in the early nineties; how qualitatively better it tasted than any previous pizza.  How explosive flavors mingled in my mouth and how my companion and I raved at how awesome it was after, literally, every bite.   None of that happened this time. Sure, the competition has dramatically stepped up but I say, respectfully, that the product has slipped a little. My outer crust was burnt, pretty badly actually. Some wood oven char is expected and I dont normally even eat the ring,  but do wonder if Chris would've served this had he been on site. Companion's pie touted basil as a topping, but came with a tiny decorative leaf or two in the center. Disappointing.   Their olive oil is heavenly. Addictive. I'd lick it off Russell Pearce if that was an option. The caprese salad, drenched in that stuff, is a first class oral shindig.   The Anglo fellow tending Bar Bianco and Hispanic gentleman manning our restaurant bar both exuded the gentle, professional charm that makes dining out a pleasure. The hostess team was competent, but that whole dance of loitering inside a busy little restaurant to identify and engage them has always felt awkward to me. I guess I'm just shy and would prefer they stand under a spinning, electric umbrella, blinking \"H-O-S-T-E-S-S\".  But seriously, getting there 3:30 or so, now that they're open continuously from lunch, will reduce the legendary waits. That's a good thing, because regardless of the gloried past or my recollection of it, this is still a distinctive and mostly charming destination.",

Also the antipasto appetizer is phenomenal!  I could have eaten the mashed sweet potatoes all night.  Now, of course, you have to talk about the wait.  My husband and I went with another couple who got there at 5:00pm to wait in a line to put their names on the list.  We, however, got there around 7:30pm and got seated at 8:45pm.  So our experience is based on an hour and 15 minute wait which I would do again in a heart beat.  If you ask the couple we went with they would never wait that long again!    I plan on going again in the very near future, probably on a weeknight, so I can have the Rosa again.  Until then I'll see her in my dreams!",

I went the other night with some friends about 8:30pm on a Wed...we finished up about 9:45...it was a weekday and not during there peak hours so it was not too busy. During this time towards the end a friend arrived late because he was in an investor meeting and had good news. This friend won an award for his invention so as a congratulatory present another friend offered to buy him an adult beverage. The waiter came over and was going to get the adult beverage BUT the owner told him NO just give him water and box up there pizza so they can take it to go.  I don't know about you but part of one's dining experience along with the quality of food is how one is treated. I went once and as a result of the service I'll never go back.   A place that you should try though is Pie Zanos...the food is delicious...half the price....and the owner is awesome...he will treat you right.",

Pizza was dry and had minimal cheese.  The entire time we were there, Chris Bianco  was sitting at a table by himself talking on his cell phone.  Too bad he wasn't in the kitchen supervising the quality of the food.  Never again.  We have had way better pizza at Pomo.  I wouldn't waste my money going here again.",

The gentlemen said they do not take reservations and that our whole party would need to be present to be sat. He also stated there was no wait so we would be fine since we were next door at Rose and Crown Pub (a fact the gentlemen knew since we told him). We paid our bill and walked across the street. We were greeted and told that a table was just leaving and it would be 30 minutes. We asked why it would take 30 minutes to bus a table and they said it was because that table was for a RESERVATION!! Lol wtf. I guess Chris Bianco feels that he is so important that customer service is not an issue at his restaurants. Its probably for the best considering everyone we told this story to said the food is mediocre at best, and not worth the wait. By the way the Try Hard Hipsters at this place are complete D-bags.",

So we decided to come early today to avoid a wait...only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends (our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car). We tried to be flexible but it was like they didn't care for our business...looks like it was never meant to be. They didn't even try to offer an explanation for their policy. Don't think I'll try to eat here again...not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it!",

I heard stories about 2-3 hours.  So I had a backup plan just in case. Fortunately, we didn't wait anywhere near that long on this Friday night.  We simply walked up, were greeted and sat down immediately. Awesome.    First thing I notice is this magnificent brick oven.  I'm figuring the pizza must be amazing.  My Marguerita pizza with mushrooms was very good, but didn't knock my socks off.  My friend got the Rosa and really liked it.  Service was very good. Best service was the guy greeting you at the door.  Great attitude and seemed to genuinely enjoy meeting people.  I offered to buy him an ice cream because it was so hot outside.  He politely turned that down but appreciated it.  I think next time I am downtown I will definitely return.",

I took a friend's advice to eat here, came 1.5 hours before opening and was one of the 40 ppl let in at the opening time.   The food was good but it was not AMAZING! WTF Oprah?! Oh.. and the 300+ reviews from Yelp that gives this place raving reviews?!   My theory is that while people wait in excess of 4 hours to get in, they get hammered at Bar Bianco next door and by the time they get to eat, of course it would be amazing! That's why bar food at 3 am is amazing.   I'm not disappointed by the food. It was good. It was not worth the wait or the money. My brother and I had soda, salads and each had a pizza for $70. Yikes!  If you're going to go despite my fair warning, the pizza is NOT a personal sized pizza. Big enough to share and you can get multiple topping on each side. Don't be left with leftovers.",

No way in hell is this \"the best pizza in America\" as Oprah and Rachel Ray say; they must have some investment in this place because this pizza is nothing special.  The pizza's are overpriced (like $15-$20) for a personal pizza.  Maybe because there are no brick oven places out in the valley like back East I'm used to, is why this place is so hyped.  You can get much better pizza at Spinato's in Tempe or anywhere else in Chicago, NJ or New York.  Not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone the 2-3 hour wait people seem to do.   Thanks but no thanks.",

No matter how long the wait, and I've waited from 1 to 3 1/2 hours, I never regret it. If the wait is really long, go next door to Bar Bianco and get some drinks and some of their fantastic olives or other finger foods. I've always found the service to be speedy once we're in, and the waiters are always friendly.  The first dilemma I always face upon making decisions at Pizzeria Bianco is whether to order the antipasto or the mozzarella tomato basil salad. The antipasto is always wonderful, featuring delicious local, seasonal, roasted and marinated vegetables and some awesome sorpressata and cheese. But then the salad has delicious local tomatoes, hand made mozzarella, nice olive oil and basil from the garden that grows outside of the restaurant. Usually if I'm not especially itching for the salad, I ask the waiter what vegetables are in the antipasto for the day, and that usually makes my decision. Both are always awesome.  Then comes the big decision. Which pizza. At this point, I've had the Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy and Wiseguy. I'm having a hard time picking a favorite, but I most often find myself ordering the Margherita, mostly because of its elegant simplicity. The tomato sauce is perfectly tart, the basil and mozzarella is delicious, and the crust is perfectly burnt on the edges. My least favorite is probably the Rosa, mostly because I'm not that big of a fan of parmigiano reggiano and it seems pretty dry. But the fennel sausage and onion on the Wiseguy and the salami on the Sonny Boy... I can't make up my mind. They're all too good. I might just have to keep going back to make my decision...",

    "text": "When everything seems to consistently single out Pizzeria Bianco as the place to go in Phoenix, how can you not go?  We arrived before 3:00 and were the third group in line.  I suppose it is rather ridiculous to line up that early when it doesn't open until 5:00, but such is life.  Bianco regulars that showed up later seemed to be used to it.  There are seats and benches outside under the shade where you can bade your time, or you can wander around the (somewhat limited) area.  While there are many terrific pizza places, what made Pizzeria Bianco a defining pizza experience for me was the balance.  There are lots of places with good dough, good sauce, good cheese, and good toppings, but a True standout pizzeria will make all the individual ingredients work together to make something truly delicious that haunts your taste buds for more, even weeks later.  The Biancoverde was the clear winner.  Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, ricotta, and arugula.  Sounds pretty simple, but it was combined to make something magical.  Crispy and smokey from the wood fire oven, sharp salty savoriness from the Parmigiano Reggiano, creamy from the ricotta and mozzarella, cut by a slight bitterness from the arugula.  The smokiness of the smoked mozzarella played well off of the sweet caramelized onions and fennel sausage in the Wiseguy.  I thought the Margherita would be the somewhat boring pie, but it went over just as well as the other pies.  The antipasto plate was also quite amazing.  The pairings of roasted vegetables, sopressata, and cheese worked in delicious harmony.  Definitely do your homework prior to coming if you want a good experience.  Slice has an excellent primer to get you ready.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fslice.seriouseats.com%2Farchives%2F2009%2F12%2Fi-finally-go-to-pizzeria-bianco-phoenix-arizona-az-amazing-pizza.html&s=031106563479cac5974d8e870758d2a7f5c03ce7cc8e6b5da8e125a1d833b799\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">slice.seriouseats.com/ar...</a>",

But that's no good, because you're hungry and drinking. By the time they call your name, you're stumbling next door with nothing else to talk about and little interest in actually eating. The excessive wait really ruins the experience.  The pizza is really good, but there is only a hair's difference between this pie and other great places around Phoenix. If you're new to the area, do it once just so that you can say you have. Otherwise, check out a new pizza place!",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying that this restaurant makes a wonderful pizza made with fresh ingredients. The reason why I gave it one star is due to the service, specifically the hostess  I decided to bring my family to this restaurant since I had been there before and I wanted to share the great experience I had two years ago. We walked in, and I was told it would be a 30-40 minute wait, which was ok since I knew it was popular. What it turned out to be was an hour wait while watching other parties that came later being seated. My mother attempted to ask politely what was the problem, and the front person said that she had told me that we would be seated in an hour. I kept on seeing other parties, regardless of size, coming in and being seated before us. When no one else could be seated and we could visibly see from outside that there were openings, we were finally seated.   It almost felt like discrimination since everyone else was Caucasian and my family is Chinese. Any Caucasian party that went it was seated almost immediately. Why did we stay? Because it would have felt like losing if we had left.   When we finally ate, the servers were good while that hostess avoid my table like a plague and would refill other people's water but ours.  The food was excellent. We ordered the following:  Tomato mozzarella salad: thick slices of tomato and mozzarella drenched on olive oil and basil. An excellent starter Spiedini: skewers of hot prosciutto wrapped around Italian fontina cheese over a bed of arugula. We wished there was one more to savor! Marinara - excellent thin crust with a nice light tomato sauce. Only gripe is I wish there was more basil Biancoverde - excellent white pizza with argula. A very good and refreshing pizza Wiseguy: white pizza with sausage and onions, the favorite of the meal. One thing I wished I did was add mushrooms.  Like I said, excellent food, poor hostess that ruined the meal for us. We tipped still because the service was good (except when we asked to see the manager). I was happy to eat the food, but I'll never go back.",

    "text": "I have gone to Pizzeria Bianco 3 times and each time I have had a pleasant experience.   I know that a lot have complained about the wait however there is a system (as some have mentioned) to this restaurant. If you will have a party larger then 6 - they will take a reservation. You must make it well in advance and definitely worth it - did this once and waited 15 minutes upon arriving to the restaurant.  The other 2 times I went to Bianco was when I had a craving for the delicious pizza. After placing our name on the list, we would head over to the wine bar next door. Order a bottle of wine, some apps and take a seat at the picnic table outside. Just as we finished our bottle of wine, the hostess found us and we were taken into our table. Perfect way to prepare yourself for what we were about to have.   The downside is that my pizza's crust has come out burnt more than once but everything else was great. It is an experience that everyone should try at least once.",

    "text": "Overrated.  I moved to AZ about two years ago and the one place all of my new coworkers told me I absolutely had to try was Pizzeria Bianco. After reading about it's rich history and lines that make people wait upwards of 3 hours for, I thought there had to be something of this legend and gave it a shot. My fiancee seemed more excited than I was because (as she constantly claims) she is a pizza fanatic with marinara sauce pumping through her veins.  We made the journey out about half an hour before they opened to ensure we wouldn't have to wait the customary amount of time and wasn't surprised to see a line of about fifteen more arrive soon after. We were the first to order and chose the WiseGuy pizza (onions, mozzarella, and sausage).  The first thing I noticed that seemed a little off putting was that there didn't seem to be a chef handling the pizza but a couple of simple line cooks. I played it off thinking it didn't matter much because how hard is it really to make a a pizza? The ingredients and recipe were going to be the stars of the show.  Even though we were the first to order we waited approximately thirty minutes before the pizza arrived. Again, I didn't think much of it at the time because in my mind, pizza of this legendary caliber was worth waiting for.  Once it finally arrived, we couldn't wait to dive in but I gave it a few moments to lessen the blow of any potential cheese burns seeing as it came fresh from the oven. My first bite was completely underwhelming. This pizza didn't have any flavor at all. The dough itself was very pleasing with a nice blend crispy and chewy textures but the cheese, onions, and sausage tasted of nothing. I never thought pizza could taste so bland. My fiancee shared the same sentiments. I thought she was joking at first and maybe I was being a little too critical but after one slice we stopped, paid our bill, and walked out of there.  I've never seen a place hyped so much that went completely in the opposite direction. There are much better places in AZ to get a great slice of pizza but for my money, Pizzeria Bianco isn't worth the time or effort.",

Pizzeria Bianco was decent pizza, but by no means worth navigating the tremendous crowds.    If you do go, I suggest going a Tuesday or Wednesday and getting there at 4 or sending someone there at 4 to hold your place.  They open at 5, but the line is snaking already by 4:45.  Luckily, there are two bars nearby to while away your wait time.  I prefer the Rose and Crown, but you can also do their wine bar and get your tab transferred over.  Everybody should come here and try it out for themselves.  It is definitely a unique Phoenix experience.  That being said, I would rather go to Cibo and wait 0 to 20 minutes for equally delicious pizza.",

    "text": "Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:  1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food. 2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list. 3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy. 4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.  The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza I've had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!",

    "text": "They're changing their hours to open for lunch!  It might improve their accessibility to the general public that has things to do!  :D  Their crusty bread that they serve is delicious.  It tastes like they put a little extra salt, but the texture and taste is unlike any other bread I've ever had.  The crust is very crusty while the inside is fluffy with lots of air pockets.  The crust for their pizzas are the best I've ever had as well.  Very chewy and great taste.  They do tend to get soggy in the middle so the very tips of the slices can barely hold together when you move in for the bite, but the crust is fantastic.  The toppings are another story.  They're fresh ingredients and you can tell this, however..  I heard the Wiseguy was the most popular one.  It has roasted onion and sausage on it.  Barely edible.  We also got the Sonny Boy and Margherita pizzas with a few toppings added to it.  This is what I learned - the olives and prosciutto are very salty, sausage is tasty and just about as salty as one would expect.  The basil is used sparingly and the arugula is not.  The appetizers were very good, but kind of overpriced.  We got the caprese salad which you can tell the cheese is freshly made that day.  We also got some cheese on sticks that were wrapped with prosciutto on a bed of arugula - that one was fantastic.  You get 2 sticks about 7\" long and I think it was $12.  Overpriced, but I would recommend it.  All in all, I enjoyed the experience - hanging out in line from 350 til 5pm when they opened and started seating, meeting the friendly wait staff (not the \"hostesses\", the down-to-earth wait staff with the t-shirts and aprons), getting close to celebrity (saw the lady from The Practice and Lie to Me - Kelli something - and her husband that was on some kid show that I'm not familiar with AND Mayor Gordon and his family came later), and paying a hefty price for dinner but not really feeling shmucked about it.  I will definitely go back, but this time just getting toppings of my own choosing!",

This doesn't not take anything away from Pizzeria Bianco which I still think it's one of the best pizza places around. It's a little pricey for a personal pizza but the skill and technique is there if that is what you want. Personally, I have gotten more into the whole \"Subway Pizza\" thing lately where you can get unlimited toppings and such for under $10. But I don't think many places can replicate what Pizzeria Bianco has. So I personally recommend... and this will cost you... get a margherita pizza with mushroom and anchovies and red wine. The saltiness and mushroom flavor will bring out your wine and the wine will bring out the taste in your pizza. Just my opinion. ;)   Anti-pasto is good too!",

I was in downtown PHX for business which ended at 10:45, just in time for the pizzeria to open. Obviously, my dining partner and I didn't have to wait for a table. Service was excellent.  We ordered a couple of local beers from Prescott Brewery while perusing the menu. We started off with the Antipasto Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata and Cheese Platter, the Margherita Pizza (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil)  and the Wise Guy Pizza (wood roasted onions, smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage). All the food was fresh and perfectly baked.  My only comments are, Yes it is a bit pricey, the Margherita Pizza was a bit bland, though my Wise Guy Pizza was fantastic. Would I come here again? Yes, if I didn't have to wait for a table and I was in the neighborhood again.",

No biggie.... we will wait. Next door they have Bar Bianco serving up drinks/snacks in a solid atmosphere while you wait. They ended up reopening the patio (after a little Phoenix rain that evening) so we got sat ahead of schedule. Staff was on point throughout the meal with multiple people checking on us and getting everything we needed. They have a good wine list with a few local wineries and 2 beers on tap (also repping local love). We got 2 pizzas and the amount for us two was perfect.   1)The Sonny Boy: with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives  2) Wiseguy: (No Sauce) with wood-roasted onions, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage.  No regrets on both options. Finished dinner with house made chocolate torte accompanied with a vanilla bean cream.   Couldn't have asked for a better meal and vibe at the location. Highly recommend and will be back.",

I am not sure if it is the best I have every had, but with that said, I don't need pizza to be fancy to love it. So overall I am okay eating at my favorite hole-in-the-wall when I have a hankering for pizza. However, if you want a fancy pizza dinning experience then this is your place.   Overall I think the whole dinning experience was great. We arrived early and waited on our other friends at the neighboring wine bar. The staff was excellent at both places. I had the margarita pizza and wine. I think what would bring me back is just the overall combination of the ambience and food. I have a hard time passing up an evening with friends, dining outside, under string lights, sipping on delicious wine and eating pizza.",

    "text": "I came here during my visit to Phoenix in January. First off, as the other reviews note, the hype has influenced the wait time, so be prepared not to eat for a while. We brought a card game with us and went to the wine bar next door to grab a drink and hang out during our 90-minute wait.   When our name was finally called, we were seated quickly and received our food very quickly as well. We ordered three pizzas: the Biancoverde, Margherita, and the Wiseguy. (Note, this was just the right amount of food for the four of us to share.)  I'll say first that the crust was delicious. It was thin and crispy, but not too crunchy, and very flavorful. I enjoyed the tomato sauce on the margherita pizza as well, and missed it a little bit on the other pizzas (they were \"white pizzas\"). I felt that the Wiseguy was the surprising favorite, as the sausage was really delicious. In general, I found all of the pizzas to be very good, but not phenomenal. I didn't enjoy myself the same way I did when I had other meals that I call \"the best ever.\"",

Very small, as other reviews state, but luckily we were on Ohio time while traveling so 5pm in AZ is really 8pm in Ohio, so we beat the rush, although all 4 tables outside were taken, and there was probably 3 open inside. Anyway, we were seated right away. This place smelled amaaaaazing, and lived up to it! My mom & I weren't super hungry and saw that the pizzas were pretty large even though they were thin.  We ordered the handmade mozzarella (caprese salad) which was enough for 3-4 people, and the biancoverde which was delicious! The arugula on top really helped cut through the delicious, salty, creamy, cheese.  The crust was so thin, it reminded me *almost* of my beloved pizza when I studied abroad in Italy. The service was great as well! Overall a fantastic dining experience while in Phoenix for a few days.",

This place has been bookmarked for years and the one time I tried about 3 years ago I was told it was a 4 hour wait and really, who did I think I was not to expecting that!? Hahaha... I was slightly offended at the time but now it's just funny.  So last weekend we took my significant others small children to the Az Science Center next door. Turns out there was a 'Sriracha Festival' going on in Heritage Square which encompasses the science center, several historical buildings including Pizzeria Bianco and a parking garage. SUPER cool little spot!  Anyway, after the science thing we decided to stop by to see if there was a wait around 2:00 on Saturday. There wasn't, we were seated immediately, I was so excited! The house Pinot Grigio was great, margarita pizza, awesome! The Caprese salad.. Amazing! Service was fantastic!   I really don't have anything negative other than I was surprised the menu was so limited but I understand they're expanding into other areas with more extensive menus etc...  It was a great experience. Am I glad I didn't wait the 4 hours the last time I tried? Yes, definitely. Will I go back if I'm literally not walking by? Nope.",

    "text": "When I was living in Chicago, I read an article in Chicago Magazine wherein a famous Chicago chef said Pizzeria Bianco would be his last meal on Earth.  I'd moved out of Phoenix in 2001 and had never gotten to try this pizza.  And if a Chicagoan was willing to go out on a limb and say the best pizza was not in Chicago (heresy to some), then I needed to try this pizza.  The first time I tried Bianco's not yet infamous pizza, I was visiting friends in town.  I waited an hour and a half to try the pizza, spending most of the wait time at Bar Bianco next door.  We made friendly chat with the bartender, who left quite a good impression on us.  We also enjoyed the goat cheese crostini appetizer and split a great bottle of red.  That first time, I was actually scalded by too hot water in the women's restroom.  Some kind of problem with the system shot out near boiling water when the dishwasher went on in the kitchen.  When I went back to my table, I asked for ice for my hand.  Chris Bianco was still making all the pizzas then, but he overheard what happened and comped my pizza before it was even out of the oven.    The first pizzas we tried were the Biancoverde and the Rosa.  Oh, the crust!  The cheese!  The fresh ingredients!  Yes, I was in love.  The next year, I waited THREE hours to have this pizza.  No, I am not crazy.  The pizza is THAT good and I was only in town for two days.  I'd been dreaming of this pizza for an entire year.  Thank GOODNESS Bianco is now open for lunch.  The wait times are not nearly as long.  In fact, this brings me to my most current visit.  On Friday a friend and I went to Bianco at 4:45 p.m.  I walked into the door to inquire about the wait.  I was told to... wait for it... pick out a table!  No wait?  At Bianco?  The Gods were shining on us.  I have been to Bianco many times since moving back to Phoenix two years ago.  The food is, as always, excellent, even though Bianco's right hand man is more likely to be making the pizzas these days.  I highly recommend the pizza, natch.  But I also recommend the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, which is made with freshly made cheese (AMAZING) and freshly picked tomatoes.  And, of course, you should not skip the bread.",

Love the Margherita pizza and their complimentary bread. The Margherita pizza had a great tomato sauce and gooey cheese. Not a fan of the Wiseguy pizza or the Local Organic Greens salad. I do appreciate their thin crust pizza that did not get overly soggy and their fast service. I would definitely return to try their other pizzas.  What I recommend:  - Margherita Pizza",

So much so that when I got back from the restroom with my son our table was occupied by another people.  I had to say something.  My waiter seemed to give 2 shits.  Now on to the pizza.  Very thin, super crisp burned spots on top.  Sauce was good but very plain.  Over all I make better pizza at home.  No fucking Joke.   This place is way beyond over hyped.  To finish it off another waiter took my plate with half a slice still on it and ran off.  Then dropped the check on the table with a get the fuck outta here attitude.   We were seriously rushed outta the place.  I dunno if it was because we only ordered a pizza and 2 waters.  But it was seriously rude.    To sum it up.

This rice pudding was perfectly consistent,  and you could taste every grain with a nice burst of vanilla.  As I said the pizza was great.  Also, the wine pours were generous.  The service was great.  I really had a great experience.",

This place was packed,  which is always a restaurant's greatest recommendation. Nice decor, very clean, and reasonable prices. Two of us with all that food got out of there for about 60 bucks.

    "text": "THE MOST OVERPRICED JIP-JOINT I'VE EVER BEEN TO. Jip-by-jip review: First jip, they make you pay for valet parking when the restaurant is literally 10 feet away from the parking area. Second jip, all the pizzas are tiny little thin crust jips with nothing more like your basic Margaritta pizza, no pepperoni! Third jip, all the pizzas, that you can literally eat in 10 seconds cause theyre so small, are 15$ minimum!! The good pizzas are 19$!! And theyre small as can be! And they dont even taste that great, its oookay, definitely not worth 20$ for a small. Fourth jip, they made us wait 25 minutes for two pizzas, I worked at a pizza place, it takes 8 minutes to cook something that thin and small. Fifth jip, they only have parmessan cheese as a side, no ranch or bleu cheese or garlic sauce or anything you'd want, and if you want extra anything (salami, anchovies) its 6$. Sixth and final jip, you have to tip the valet guy for walking 5 feet. They have to pay people for good reviews, they definitely have the money from the overpriced everythingg, because this place is a stonecold Jip joint.",

    "text": "We lucked out with their lunch hours and snagged one of the last tables with a...ZERO MINUTE WAIT. If anyone knows anything about Pizzeria Bianco is that the line to get a table can get quite long.  It's been nearly two years since I have been to PB, but I'm glad that nothing's changed. The service is incredibly attentive, the atmosphere is rustic/casual-chic, and the food is both delicious and reasonably priced. Bianco has high standards for quality and so every aspect of our lunch was flawless. From the table bread which was soft on the inside but with a good crust on the outside, the high-quality olive oil that came with it, and the locally sourced produce they use, an experience at Pizzeria Bianco is unsurpassed.   We started off with one of my most favorite things: the Spiedini appetizer. Traditionally, spiedini are the Italian equivalent of kebabs or yakitori; skewered meats grilled or baked in open fire. Bianco's version is sinful-prosciutto wrapped fontina cheese on a wooden stick, grilled in the oven. Lusciously gooey cheese encapsulated in salty, fatty pork and served on a bed of peppery local arugula.  Since we were having lunch so late and we had big dinner plans, we decided to split one pizza (which was more than enough). We went with the Wiseguy which featured wood-roasted onions (sweet and tender), house-smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. The smoke on the mozzarella was perfect; not too overwhelming, but very distinct, and the sausage was dense and locally made by Schreiner's Phoenix. Although the toppings on this pizza were delicious, the highlight was really in the dough. I've always thought that what really sets Bianco's pizzas apart from everyone else was the quality and texture of the crust. Crisp, yet delicate; soft enough but with a slight chew. Pizzeria Bianco has mastered pizza dough.  LOVE.  TIPS: Try and make reservations for groups of 6 or more or try to make it for lunch. If coming for dinner, come prepared for a bit of a wait. Bar Bianco next door is a great way to kill some time.",

We were initially told that it would be an hour and 15 minute wait, probably less. We hesitantly agreed to wait since we drove so far to try this place. An hour and 40 minutes later we were seated. Did they rush to take our order? No. Was the taste of the pizza worth the wait? No. They did however give us a free order of antipasto and took off the cost of the salad we ordered which was a nice gesture but didn't make up for the wait. The food is good. Not great. Definitely not worth the wait. But if you can get in quick, give it a try. If you're visiting the Flagstaff area, Pizzicletta is much better and, although very small, will yield a shorter wait.",

    "text": "With nearly a thousand reviews of PIZZERIA BIANCO the polarity between love & hate is amazing. HERE IS THE ONLY REVIEW YOU'LL EVER NEED TO READ.  On one side of the aisle, you have the idiot trendoids who love bragging about how long they'll wait in line for restaurants, and how they were eating there before anybody else. They'll gladly report, \"THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER, WELL WORTH THE 3 HOUR WAIT!!!!\" They also don't mind overpaying to be underfed. These people are easily recognized by their ability to spend $300 on an outfit that makes them look homeless and by their incessant need to always be sporting at least one Apple product.  The other camp is the folks who hate this place on a near personal level. They act as insulted by the food or wait time as they would be by a Nazi-sympathizer or a spit in the face. These are people who hate most everything that has proven to be popular with other people, and they hate Pizzeria Bianco, even though there's nothing hatable here.  Both groups are generously represented here. Both groups are full of shit. HERE'S THE TRUTH.  Best Pizza Ever? Hell no. You'd have to be functionally retarded to call this the \"BEST\" pizza you've ever eaten. In a lot of books, what is being served here wouldn't even qualify as pizza. An overly simple menu offers only 6 pie choices, 3 of which offer no tomato sauce and 2 offering no cheese. Pizzeria Bianco is really more of a Lavash than a pizza in that the crust is more of a toasted cracker than a pizza crust. This will lead to a soggy mess only minutes after your pie comes out of the oven. Is there any way, honestly, you can call something a pizza when your ingredient menu EXCLUDES PEPPERONI, MEATBALLS (ground beef of any kind), & GREEN PEPPERS. That's right, none of these exists on the premises. BEST PIZZA EVER?!? C'mon Corky, Life Goes On Without Pizzeria Bianco.  Worst Pizza Ever? Seriously? You never had a Totino's or a Lil Caesar's $5 crap pie? I truly believe the people who hate Pizzeria Bianco are really just hating on the people stupid enough to proclaim undying love for this place. This pizza(?) is not offensive in the least, even if it isn't really pizza. We actually liked the flavor of our WISE GUY. Again, we questioned whether of not it should even be classified as a pizza, but it was none-the-less tasty. Had I waited 2-3 hours, would I have been pissed off? Yep. Not to the point where I'm pissed off for life at everybody involved with the joint, like they shot my dog. Then again I'm not stupid enough to wait 2-3 hours at a place like this.  There's the rub with Pizzeria Bianco....the people who are claiming it to be the \"best ever\" and \"well worth the hours wait\" are absolute idiots, full of shit to the point of turning their eyes brown. Those who hate Pizzeria Bianco and it's fans like they contribute to Al Qaeda, have no real basis for their hatred and are way too over-reactive.  So judge for yourself.  Go down on a Saturday between 11am & noon to avoid the notorious wait times, drink a cold one and have lunch. You'll discover what we did; Pizzeria Bianco is simply a charming little place with nice people serving what may or may not be pizza. But that ain't so bad.",

Both were great, but the Rosa was the standout winner!  Ordered the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas for people in his crew who thought they were amazing. When I left town, he and members of the crew couldn't wait to get off to go get pizza there and if they went in late (1pm) it was breakfast. Word spread :)  Just a note: this place does not do take out and they get really, really busy. I did not know that and came in to take pizzas away (for the crew). It was almost a problem, but the manager asked the kitchen and they said they had space in the oven to do it. I was really appreciative of their professionalism and accommodation. Great service, I do not forget.",

I've only gotten their white pizzas there but I have loved them both. The last time I went there, I got the Sonny Boy and it was really good. I've never seen pistachios on a pizza and was a little hesitant, but it turned out to be delicious! The crust on these pizzas is probably the best I've had anywhere and I love to try out pizza places. It is the perfect combination of crunchy, crispy, and chewy.   We also got a salad (which comes with their bread) and it was a great, light way to start. It wasn't anything special, but we were starving so the bread definitely helped fill out stomachs up a little bit and made us happy campers after the long wait. :)  Whenever people visit, I always take them here and Camelback mountain because I feel like these two are staples of Arizona.",

    "text": "When a man falls in love, it's a special thing. Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening. Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul.   It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.  Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.  I heard all the hype...\"best pizza in the country\", \"Oprah says it's the best\", \"The Food Network hypes it up\", \"Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus\". Ok, I made up the last one.  My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right?   Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait.   Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.  I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect.   Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions.   We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.  The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.  We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.  The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza . All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil.   The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion.   The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor.   Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!  Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.  Maybe it's True. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.  Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.  Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.  #300",

Perfect spot to grab a bottle or glass of wine before dinner. The restaurant itself is cozy, warm, and filled with delicious scents from the large oven. The margherita and the onion & pistachio pizzas are my favorites. The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the crust is perfection. The caprese salad is also great! I loved everything about my experience here.. Definitely plan to return again & again. Plan ahead and if possible go with a small party on a less crowded night during the week to avoid a reallyyy long wait.",

I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!  PS GET THERE EARLY!!",

When we checked back, we decided to get drinks next door and ended up being seated less than 10 minutes later. So that wait-time people hype up... not as intimidating as it seems.  We were only a party of 2, and I regret not going with more people to try as many pizzas as possible. My friend got a salad with pears (or maybe apples?) and I got the prosciutto-wrapped cheese skewers. We shared a margharita pizza. It was exactly the right amount of food for us.  My friend loved the salad; the skewers were ingenius. Who doesn't like melted cheese on a stick?!!! The pizza was very tasty -- there was some kind of cheese, asiago or parm. reggiano? baked into the crust. Every bite was tasty, from beginning to end. The crust was perfecto.  The downside to eating here is that you'll smell like wood-burning garlickyness for hours after.",

Got the Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese, the farmers market salad - Honeydew Melon with a thin slice of prosciutto on top.  Pizza - ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios.  Everything was great!  Rosa had a lot of Red Onion though, probably would have been better with a large group to share instead of the only pizza for 2 people.

Second, the restaurant. Small, intimate, cozy, & damn it if you don't feel special just eating there in the dim lighting of a warm fire. Third, the food. The simplicity of the menu allows us to center in on the food & not be drowned under 5 pages of fluff like other \"restaurants\". The focus on only a few items that are made to enjoy & not just fill you up is how things should be done. Why have 100 choices if they all fall under the radar. Mae West said, \"Between two evils, I generally like to pick the one I never tried before.\" When your done having to choose between several food \"evils\" at other places, come down to Pizzeria Bianco and try a slice of heaven. The pizza is great, I'm not going to paint you a Monet like description. Come down, buy a pie, find out for yourself. Read a review, then try the food & make up your own mind.",

    "text": "There will of course be some negative reviews here, for the same reason that Little Ceasars will get some five star reviews...people are ridiculous. This restaurant is amazing. Our wait was a little under three hours long on a Thursday evening. We arrived at six, and received our first pizzas just after nine. Three of us ordered six pizzas and finished five.  You will not see any crusts piling up on the tables, because they are a perfectly charred, yet chewy, and good enough to be on the menus by themselves. Even licking my fork was more satisfying than some other restaurant meals I've had. My napkin appeared unused because I would rather have licked my own face than lose some of that deliciousness to a wipe.  My first pizza was, of course, the Margherita, and the second was the Biancoverde, with ricotta and arugala, and was quite rich.  All in all, this is definitely in the top two pizza places I've ever been to, with Apizza Scholls taking points as my amazing local joint in Portland.  If you want to feed a bunch of kids some pizza after a little league game, this is not the place for you. But if you want a True pizza experience that will make you want to save a slice to put in your pillowcase so you will have sweet pizza dreams, then this is the place.",

    "text": "My parents and I visited this place early in December and I completely forgot to check it out on Yelp for a review. But the Gods were with me and the timing was right (lucky), and we got in first seating at 5 p.m. I had seen the place years ago during a Monday Night Football game between the Bears and Cardinals. You know, the Dennis Green meltdown game. ABC showed video of the dining room as a bumper for commercials, saying it was named best pizza in America, and I imagined it to be a much larger place.  We arrived around 4pm on a Friday and found 20 people lingering outside. By 4:30 the line was down to the Bar Bianco building, which is about another 30 or so people deep. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this issue, so I'll skip to the part where we were the last table seated. Super lucky again.  I've had the Neapolitan pizza before at a place called Spacca Napoli in my hometown, Chicago. While they are very similar, Bianco's has an edge in the toppings department. The Margherita had great tomato flavor and the cheese was certainly one-of-a-kind. Basil was fresh, green and spicy. Some people find the classic pizza to be not to their liking, or generic, but to sell this pizza chefs have to adhere to certain traditions, including using imported flour, oil and an internship in Naples. It's like a flat-bread on steroids. It's not perfect and generally the middle is a little floppy. If you know this going in, it helps.  Probably wouldn't repeat because I can get it at home way easier, although Spacca Napoli gets real busy in the summer. Overall the experience was awesome, and a handshake from the owner/chef, Chris Bianco, on the way out sealed the deal. You just can't discount that kind of personal attention.",

    "text": "It was our last week living in Phoenix and we still hadn't tried Bianco. We knew this was something that absolutely had to be done before leaving or we could potentially regret it for eternity. It was now our last Saturday so why not go out with a bang-Bianco it is. We got there around 4:30 knowing based on Martha Stewart and most importantly, YELP reviewers, that we would be in for a long evening. First there was the 40 minute wait to get the name on the list. Once that phase was over we found a lovely piece of real estate at Bar Bianco to plant ourselves for what they said would be a 4 hour wait. Our party of 3 began with 1 bottle of wine, then 2 and then.....yep it had been 4 hours and we checked with the host Nazi who said it would be another hour...so...why not add a 3rd bottle of wine to the tab.. WOW   By this time we were pretty faded and so extremely excited to dive into the pies.  The food was astounding, service was great but the 5 hour wait was a little extreme for food.   We did it right-we had the right company, we didn't go into the experience hungry, and we enjoyed bar Bianco.   It really is a 'must do' when in Phoenix but I doubt it would be my regular spot since it isn't often that I have 6 spare hours (more with travel) to devote to a meal. But, for what it was, it was delectable.",

    "text": "This may be a first so I want everyone to brace themselves.  Bianco's is OVERRATED!  There, I said it. I'm sure I lost some readers along the way but I can handle that.  The most unfortunate thing about this whole Bianco love affair is that the concept, building, and product are all excellent. The pizza is very good. The building is an amazing old brick structure that reminds me of my loft. The area is as beautiful as you will find in downtown Phoenix, surrounded by lush greenery, a garden, and tons of history. Waiting isn't even that bad when you consider Bar Bianco is full of the same character and spirit that the pizzeria is. I hate to hate Pizzeria Bianco...but I do.  We went a couple years back. We were going to a Dbacks game of particular importance (Dirty Byrnes t-shirt night) and decided we'd put our names in at Bianco's. The wait is usually 2 hours so that gave us plenty of time to watch most of the game. Around the 5th we decided it had been enough time so we headed over. The hostess told us it would be another hour or so.  Hmph....  Of course we had no idea that the Oprah Show was doing a special on the restaurant this night so Gail is running around inside making a hell of a backup for the kitchen. Just our luck.  Almost two more hours later we were finally seated. Gail left a few minutes after that. We ordered the Biancoverde pizza (which was not green) and well, it tasted like every other wood-fired pizza I have ever had. The crust was charred on the bottom but the pizza was perfect. I'm not sure if brick ovens are outlawed in downtown, but I don't get the trend. In any event, as we were about to finish, Chris Bianco came over and apologized for making us wait so long, he paid for our dinner and bought us dessert. Awful nice for a guy who knows that every housewife within 3000 miles is going to be flying to Phoenix to wait four hours for his pizza.  Like I said, I didn't hate it. But it wasn't worth 4 hours. It wasn't worth the original 2 but I had to see what the hype was about. I wouldn't wait longer than 40 minutes for Bianco's because, that is the longest you will ever wait at Cibo. You will have a similar experience for a similar price but you won't be starved when you finally sit down to eat.",

Our drinks were delivered to our table and a couple questions about the menu were asked. A few minutes after that a woman came over and asked us if we just sat ourselves. We answered yes because there was an open table on the patio, no sign, and no one had greeted us as we walked up to the patio. We didn't think about it as we did not see anyone standing and it's a pizza place. But we were wrong. The woman told us we cut in front of a bunch of parties and we were brought our tab and asked to leave. I was upset because she was very rude about it and the waitress never said anything. So I ended up having to pay $18 dollars for our drinks and then we walked across to the pub across the street where the food and service was much better. I would never eat here again. At least they could have asked us to wait. Plain rude!!",

    "text": "The Longest Wait for Food...  Pizzeria Bianco was voted #1 pizza in America.  Being NY pizza die-hards, a few of my friends and I decided to check it out while visiting a friend in Arizona.  We had expected a wait but never expected it to be 3+ hours!   We waited about an hour to put our name on the list and they said it was going to be a couple of hours.  Rather than hanging around, we decided to make use of the time shopping nearby.  We called back after an hour and they said to check in again an hour later.  We checked in again and they said we should come back to the Pizzeria.  After we got back, we hung out at the quaint wine bar next door and waited some more.   After what seemed like an eternity, we finally got seated.  We shared 3 pies -- the wiseguy fennel sausage, margherita and bianco verde.  It may be because we were famished beyond hunger by then but the pizza was very good.  The ingredients were fresh and the pies were piping hot.    We decided to get 2 more pies to go...to justify the long wait.  :)  I've never waited so long for food and doubt I will do it again even though it was good.   For me, DI FARA in Brooklyn NY [<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/di-fara-pizza-brooklyn%5D\">yelp.com/biz/di-fara-piz...</a> is still my FAVORITE ANYWHERE...and the wait is not as long.",

    "text": "While being drunk and in a hurry limit my ability to rank this against NY's finest, i can confidently say that Pizzeria Bianco rivals any pizza I've ever had.  And no offense to the Italian population of Phoenix but this blows my mind more than how Luis Gonzalez's piss-ass bloop hit won the 2001 Diamondbacks-Yankees World Series.  They offer 6 different pizzas on the menu - three of which don't have any tomato sauce.  I ordered the Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil).  Here's the verdict...  Cheese - The fresh mozzarella was FANTASTIC.  Sharpest mozzarella I've ever had on a pizza.  I'm assuming it's bufala (buffalo) mozzarella but can't say for sure.  You get one blob of cheese per slice and, while I would've gladly taken more, this was best for the overall balance of the slice.  Crust - Fantastic as well.  It hit all three C's - crispy, chewy, and charry (made up word but should be self-explanatory).  I'd have sworn it came from a coal oven (consdiered the best b/c it gets super hot - in NY, they aren't legal but there's a grandfather clause for some of the older places).  Sauce - Good but clearly plays a backseat to the cheese and crust.  Kinda like Spinderella to Salt & Pepa or talent to Hall & Oates.  I also tried one of my friends' Wiseguy (House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage, Wood Roasted Onion).  I didn't like it as much - missed having tomato sauce - but liked the smoky mozzarella and really liked the sausage.  The restaurant is clean, quaint, and pleasant.  Despite it taking 3 hours (!) to get a table, it really wasn't much of an ordeal as there were places nearby to get drinks and the hostess was very helpful (e.g., providing an estimate time when we'd sit, telling us when to check back in).  And sometimes you can't rush it when someone's putting that much TLC into their pizza....   Highly recommended to anyone visiting Phoenix (with some time on their hands) or to anyone who lives in the area.",

    "text": "Wow. This is the real deal. Pizza on the order of Lombardi's and Grimaldi's. In Arizona! The margherita was almost everything it's supposed to be: super thin crust, blisters from the wood burning oven, house made sauce wonderfully balanced, house made fresh mozzarella that tasted wonderful and garden fresh basil. I could easily forgive them for not crisping the crust so that it would hold up the toppings. It's a rule: one never finds really crispy crusts (ie, burnt) outside of NY. But it allowed the crust to assert itself in taste. And tasty it was.   But the best thing about Pizzeria Bianco is the fellowship that it engenders with the people who gladly wait hours to get a seat in this small restaurant. Judging from the other yelpers, there are exceptions, but I had great conversations with my fellow diners at the bar and the service was wonderful. I got on line about 45 minutes before the opening at 5pm on a Tuesday. There were only about 17 people in front of me and the folks who followed, happily got in line behind me. The friendliness of the crowd was surprising but I can easily imagine how this could turn irate. But not yesterday. It was lovely evening and everyone seemed happy to be there.",

The fresh mozzarella (made in-house daily) and tomato appetizer was oh so delish. Don't expect to find typical pizza toppings here. Oh, and the pizza crust is thin and crispy - just the way I LOVE it. My favorite pizza was the Bianconverde and Rosa. Again, loved the fresh mozzarella on the pizza. Loved, loved it!

Was told it is made with OO flour, fresh yeast cake, water, sea salt, and little bit of dough from the day before. The wood burning brick oven looks to be the real deal, with a thick black smoke floating a few inches above the cooking surface. Had the margherita, biancoverde, and Sonny Boy. All where good and only the highest quality ingredients are used. The crust had enough charred to imbue with the earthy scent and quality that makes crust so habit forming. The stand out was the margherita. The oven does wonders for the tomato sauce and really brings it alive. Probably one of the best margherita I have ever and had works perfectly with the simplicity of the dough. The gaeta olives on the Sonny Boy are excellent but paired with the salami made for a slightly rich pie. Lastly, the cheeses of the biancoverde paired well with the sharpness of the arugula and highlighted their fresh richness. An excellent pie overall. The place is small, cute, and busy. Waits can be long but are worth it. There are very nice benches outside to enjoy a beer while waiting for your table. Service is solid, informative, and friendly. An excellent value (especially for the quality). Phoenix is very fortunate to have a place of this high a quality.",

    "text": "Went there last week for the first time while in town for a meeting.  I do not know what all the complaining about is, we only waited 2.45 hours. I am not part of the \"cattle\", never have been. It would be easy to justify in my own head that I ate the best pizza on the planet, and that the wait was well worth it, making myself not feel stupid for waiting to eat bread,with tomato sauce and cheese. Just cannot do it. I am an idiot for waiting 2.45 hours for a pizza. Someone kick me if I ever do that again.  How was the pizza???It was good, but I can get good pizza without the wait. Thing is I feel that what they have going is that the wait leaves people starving, so you might be able to serve wonder bread with tomato sauce, it just might be the best thing you have ever had.  My conclusion is that this place is a phenomenon, that it lives on hype and a 3 hour wait for pizza, that you have to convince yourself the wait was worth it and its the best pizza that you have ever had.  Sorry all, just cannot join in on the hype, just to make myself feel better.",

I went on a Tuesday at around 8ish which seemed like a good time to come because I heard the wait is ridiculous and sometimes the line is out the door around the corner.  Parking was limited but it was only a $3 valet charge.  When I got there the wait was about 25-30 minutes, but they directed me to their bar, Bar Bianco next door while I waited.  Smooth move because while I enjoyed the local ale and chit chatted with the bartender, my wait was over quickly.  Since I was flying solo that night I got seated pretty fast at the bar located at the pizzeria.  Ordered the Rosa which was topped with Red Onion, Parmesan, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios...a delicious combo :)  The guy next to me also had the right idea also and the place was recommended by his foodie boss.  He offered me a slice of his Margherita pizza.  As tempting and amazing as it looked, I had to sadly decline.  Now I wish I took a bite! Don't let the wait discourage you.  A must try place.  Maybe not THE BEST pizzeria, but it's pretty good :)",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco is an experience: it depends if it's going to be good or bad based on your attitude.   I've eaten there twice, once in a group of three, the other time as a group of seven. I didn't mind the wait so much during the group of three (2.5 hours) because we found a comfy spot over at Bar Bianco (in the heat) and chatted away. The group of seven though was trying. A 4.5 hour wait that included an impatient 13-year-old, freezing temperatures, mud, and about eight bottles of wine for six people. Not a good idea. My sister eats at Pizzeria Bianco about once a month and knows the owners/staff through business and didn't want to piss them off through complaining about the wait. You'd think we'd get better service or have a faster wait thanks to the connection, but it didn't happen. Make reservations if you have a party of 6 or over. It will save your sanity.  I do have to say that the food is delicious once you trudge through the wait. My favorites are the Caprese salad and the Wiseguy (I'm a sucker for sausage and onions). I've had slices of the other pizzas (the Margherita is great and the Sonny Boy is good too if you like olives). The freshness of the ingredients and dough do shine through.  The killer though is the wait. If they had a bit more ambiance outside (perhaps more tables or entertainment or even passing out little samples of the pizza as an amuse bouche) or revamp Bar Bianco to accommodate more people, it would be better.   If I get a craving for pizza though, I'll save my sanity and go to Grimaldi's.",

    "text": "Money can't buy you class, but 30$ (approx) can buy you the most spectacular dinner at Pizzeria Bianco! I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars. In the end, I decided on 4 because 1) there's no 1/2 star and 2) the goshdarn wait!  We were a larger party (8) so I did try to make a reservation in advance but calling 2 weeks in advance is not enough. You need to call a month in advance apparently. The first time I called the woman who answered was very abrupt and basically told me \"no\". But I was so hell bent on making it happen I called again and the second time a different woman was very friendly and told me other options making it sound possible.  So i took her advice and went in at 5:30, put our names in, went back to where we were staying for awhile, called at 7, and returned with everybody at 8pm. We were seated very shortly after arriving. For the most part service was friendly, some more than others, some were abrupt but i really can't complain. (I heard the owner has asthma and is not there very often anymore?)   So the most important--the food. We started with the farmer's market salad and the antipasti plate which had the most delicious roasted vegetables!( I woke up the next day thinking about them) They are not to be missed! And then since we had a large group, we ordered one of every pizza to try. I really enjoyed the wise guy pizza which has fennel sausage and to which we added mushrooms--good call. Another favorite was the one with pistachio nuts. A surprising fave was the cheeseless pizza which had a really rich,flavorful tomato sauce and went well with the wine we ordered (can't remember the name but it was a local wine, [who woulda thought Arizona has good wines?], a sangiovese)  All in all we had a lovely evening and everyone in the group enjoyed the pizzas. i think there were different favorites among everyone so all pizzas can and should be recommended. It just takes a little planning to make it all come together.  I would love to visit again and maybe give it that 5th star. My pizza book #1 Mozza (LA) #2 Pizzeria Bianco",

Flew in from Florida, made reservations for a group of 8, waited over three hours, got yelled at and disrespected on multiple occasions by the hostesses... we were asked to wait across the street at bar during the 3 hours; appetizers and drinks were what held us over. Once they got around to call us in for our table, they refused to seat all of us because only 7 of the 8 group members were present in the courtyard. We went and got the eighth person, who had a chicken wing and a drink in hand from the other bar-- yelling ensued courtesy of the hostesses (?owner) claiming that \"this isn't a damn food court.\" We should have left, but given the investment in time, we went ahead and stayed.  Food was decent, definitely not worth the hype. Wait staff were actually pleasant. Restaurant itself was quite hot and humid (obviously because of the oven).  Given the utter disrespect that our group received, whatever the reason, I warn others to eat a large meal before going since you'll work up a healthy appetite during your endless wait.",

    "text": "Ok so the day finally came...on a day when I was on the rare verge boredom, I extended my walk to include Heritage Square and glanced over at the crowd waiting at the Pizzeria. Hummm, it wasn't as long as I had seen it before, as a patron of the Rose & Crown numerous times. With nothing to do with my evening I decided to put my name on THE LIST.  The estimated wait was two and a half hours and I was instructed to check in every hour.  I meandered across to the R&C for a slow leisurely beer (one hour successfully passed by). I walked over and \"checked in\" as requested and then meandered over and spent the rest of my wait at Bar Bianco.  Overall I got my name on the list around 5:30 and was seated by 8.  Seated at the bar, I opted for the Wiseguy (add garlic). No salad or bread, just the pizza. Others seated at the same time next to me at the bar ordered salads and/or bread and waited another 20-30 minutes after I had received my pizza to get theirs. So obviously they pace out the order to allow you to finish your starters.   There was nothing outstanging or spectaular about it to wait that long.  Would I go back? I would go back , if someone really wanted to try it and they were the ones waiting.  I would meet them closer to seating time for a few drinks.  To me, I have had pizza similar at places like Grimaldi's and I have never had to wait there. Next stop Cibo.",

It's funny, I was born and lived in New York, got to live in Chicago, and both cities take a lot of pride in their pizza, and as a result, I did become jaded and developed the False idea that good pizza only comes from these cities. New Yorkers like to say it's in the water. I doubt that. What I love about Pizzeria Bianco is that it lives up to the hype and maintains its modesty. The place is modest. The staff works hard. No gloating. So yeah, prepare to wait. Or go off peak, say before 11:30 AM for lunch. The margherita pizza is the litmus test for me. The dough is instantly superior to any other pizza place. That makes a huge difference. Take that, the perfect cooking of the crust (the right texture, char, crispy, chewy, sweet, and salty) and add supremely simple but fresh ingredients, and there you have it. Perfection. Enjoy. These are not large pies. Order one for yourself, otherwise you may regret not having ordered enough. With every single bite, from the first to the list, I kept thinking to myself, \"Should I order a second pizza?\" I made the pilgrimage. Go check it out for yourself!",

    "text": "I will admit, I have always been a detractor.  The moment someone labels something \"Best (whatever) in (wherever)!\" my immediate reaction is to think there is a giant media conspiracy afoot to trick all the gullible peons into thinking they're onto something really special.  So you can imagine my disappointment when, over a year ago, I finally got the chance to try this place, and found it to be...good?  OK, I still didn't think \"Best in America!!!\" was warranted, and I didn't think it was worth the 2-3 hour wait to eat dinner at a reasonably early hour, but the meal was clearly enjoyable.  Fast forward a year.  We're driving around town on a noble quest to locate the best pizza in Phoenix, and we decided we ought to try Bianco again, just as a yardstick.  Now I have had some of the most highly rated pies this fair metropolis has to offer: I've had different crusts, different toppings, different sauces, and I'm starting to notice the little things that make the difference between a good pie and a mediocre one.  Going into Bianco with this perspective yielded a whole different outcome.  I can no longer deny it: Pizzeria Bianco makes an incredibly good pizza.  The little things were all there: the crust was perfect, the sauce was fresh and flavorful, the ingredients were high quality.  The toppings were simple, yet sublime.  This time I had the Sonny Boy, which has nothing more than tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami, and olives.  A very unassuming mix of toppings indeed, and one in which the flavors worked together in perfect harmony to placate my tastebuds in the most authoritative manner imaginable.  No, it wasn't my favorite pie ever.  But it may have been the most well-constructed, and finessed.  In fact, I don't even know if I can say Pizzeria Bianco is my favorite pizza place.  I have had a few pies I liked better than the one I had at Bianco, but this one may have been the most technically sound, if that makes any sense.  So there you have it.  As much as it pains me to admit it, this place deserves its reputation.  One friend complained that they are too pretentious: I think they've earned the right to be a little bit pretentious.  If you're not too concerned about the details, you may not find this place to be that special.  But if you don't at least enjoy your pie, there is probably something wrong with you.  I don't know if Bianco will always be this good, since they're opening up other locations now, and when that happens, quality can suffer.  Let's hope for the best.",

    "text": "Over priced, over rated and (look out) over head. We had heard such great things about this restaurant that perhaps we set our hopes too high...  We went to Pizzeria Bianco a few months ago for lunch. It was a bit after the lunch rush, so we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full.   The menu is a bit sparse but we figured that it was so good, they were concentrating on quality vs. quantity of menu offerings. We ordered the handmade buffalo mozzarella and basil caprese salad and a \"sonny boy\" pizza that had salami and gaeta olives. Bianco claims that they use local tomatoes and I'm not disputing that they do. However, we went in the height of the tomato season when heirlooms are at their peak and plentiful at the farmers market, yet they served us tasteless, limp tomatoes with a schmear of balsamic. I never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brined when they made it as it had no flavor.  For a $9 appetizer, it simply was not up to par.  The pizza was also underwhelming. The crust was ok but the toppings were minimal and the cheese on top was barely cooked. I was sitting in the table at the far corner near the front of the restaurant and I kept seeing speckles of dust in the air. I made the mistake of looking up and I saw that the wooden beams in this restaurant have about an inch of dust on them that flaked down on me and my pizza during the course of my meal. I was kind of too grossed out to continue eating and I was actually too embarrassed for the restaurant to tell the wait staff who probably couldn't do anything about it anyway.   Hopefully, they have done a deep cleaning of the restaurant in the last few months. Honestly, if you have ever looked at the dust that accumulates on your ceiling fan if you haven't cleaned it in awhile, it looked like that x 10. Our simple lunch was about $30.. Maybe they charged us an extra topping for the dust.",

When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at \"The BEST pizza in the country\" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasn't disappointed!   We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu: Apps: Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm  Pizza: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil  MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives  BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage   Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.  Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!  Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!",

The pizzeria is not very large - maybe large enough for 30 at any one time.  Behind the counter is a large brick oven.  I ordered the pizza to go and waited for about 15 minutes before it was presented to me.  I drove back to my hotel in rush hour traffic and approximately 25 minutes had elapsed by the time I chowed down on the pizza.  Even though it was not piping hot it was still great. The crust is amazing - very light, chewy and a great char.  My pizza was a margherita and I added the wood roasted mushrooms and sopressata.  The sopressata was the reason for losing a star.  Perhaps its an acquired tastte but I would have preferred regular pepperoni as the sopressata was a little \"gamey\" for my taste.  But again, the fresh mozzarella, sauce and especially the crust were one of a kind and I would definitely return.  Its an artisanal pie and has to be judged as such.  I would have to say DeLorenzos in Trenton was a better pie and Bleeker St Pizza in NY was a better taste experience.  This is a stand alone experience and I would urge everyone who loves pizza to check it out.",

A bonus was the chef who started it all was in the house and cooking.  An example of the attention to every detail:  our bar tender forgot for a minute to put our salad order in.  No worries...he soon remembered and our salad came well before the pizza's,  We were not even upset.  As the new (there was a shift change) bar tender prepared our ticket, the chef called him over to look at the ticket.  We later realized we were not charged for the salad, and the chef wanted to make sure of it.  The best pizza I have had!",

The seating inside is limited, so if you come during peak hours (i.e., Friday night), be prepared to wait! However, I came this last time for lunch with 2 other people on a Friday afternoon, and we were seated right away. Turnover and service is fast because the menu is pretty small. We split 2 pizzas between the 3 of us, which was more than enough. I highly recommend the biancoverde, which has arugula on it! So yum!",

However, my True standard is: if this place were in New Haven, New York, or Naples, would I ever go? Unfortunately, my answer is \"no.\"  Why not?  1. I love thin crust pizza, but for me, this was a little too thin. I enjoy a little chew in the crust; my pizza was more cracker-like.  2. I wish there were more varieties of pizza on the menu.  On the plus side, the sauce might be my favorite pizza sauce ever. Since we'll be living down the road in Tucson in a few months, I'm sure that I'll be back to Pizzeria Bianco soon.",

Biancoverde, Wiseguy, Rosa and Margherita pizzas were shared amongst friends.   By unanimous decision, Margherita was the top choice. It was clean and balanced. I would definitely order it many times over.  Tip: Add prosciutto americano onto the Margherita pizza and feel the flavor explode in your mouth. Your taste buds will thank you.",

Decided to kill time by grabbing a glass of amazing La Spinetta Moscato d'Asti next door at Bar Bianco.  It was easy to snag a table at Pizzeria Bianco, but be warned -- you'll probably wait more than an hour for a table if you get there after 4:30.  The place is small so plan accordingly.  They also take reservations for parties of 6 or more a month in advance.  I ordered the Margherita and the Rosa.  I enjoyed the Margherita.  I liked the pistachios and red onions on the Rosa but the pizza was way too oily.  All in all, I would come back but not if there's a wait.",

    "text": "I had heard about how good their pizza is for years, but since I live in LA, I wasn't sure when I'd get to try it. Only until recently, when my husband and I made a point of stopping here for lunch on our road trip to Tucson did we get to find out for ourselves what everyone's been talking about. First thing to know, they have a $3 valet lot, that they conveniently charge on your bill, so you don't have to worry if you don't have change on you to pay for it. Secondly, they have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly, which we took advantage of. We arrived close to 2pm on a weekday, so the lunch crowd had gone, and there was no wait for service. We ended up ordering a Rosa and a Margherita pizza. The Rosa is considered a \"white\" pizza since it has no tomato sauce on it. As a result, I slightly preferred the Margherita, since they use fresh tomatoes to make their sauce, which is really tasty. But the Rosa was yummy too, if you're looking to try something less traditional.   What makes their pizza so great is that it is completely authentic to how pizza is made in Italy: fresh tomato sauce, a thin, crisp and lightly burnt crust, all baked in a wood fired oven. It may not be to everyone's liking, but if you are a pizza purest, then this place is for you!",

It's in such a cute, vintage little building with a lovely park and center surrounding it. The outdoor seating and indoor seating are both comfortable, though inside it is a little cramped.   I love the white pizzas ( I can't remember the name, but it doesn't have traditional marinara-type sauce) and they have great salads, too.  They are pricey- if I remember about $16-20 per person, and I didn't get full.  BUT it is a great experience and everyone should at least TRY it. Cute for a quiet date night or lunch treat.",

We heard all of the horror stories of 2 to 3 hr long waits and to grab yourself a Bottle of Wine and prepare for a long night out....we didn't care and went out on a Monday night to give it a try.  To our surprise, there was NO WAIT at all, YEAH!!!!  We were immediately seated at a table (2 top) and given our menus.  It's very dark in the dining room and the menus were a little difficult to read in the ambient light....had to use our cell phone flashlight.  We decided to order:  Sonny Boy w/Sausage  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg#MyRRg57xLO58zg7bbf2fcg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz...</a>  Bianco Verde w/Prosciutto <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg#39b-Ufs5AEg-UJiR9u5qRg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz...</a>  While we were waiting for our food they sat a table of 5 at the 4 top next to us....since the tables are so close, the back of the 5th person's chair was nearly touching our table...that kind of crept into our personal space and was a little uncomfortable.....especially since one of the girls in his party looked at us while getting seated and proclaimed \"It's his birthday, woo-hoo!!!\".....that's awesome and I hope you guys have a good time, but we came here to dine by ourselves and enjoy each other's company, not join a strangers birthday party....*ugh*...  Our Pizza came out a short time later.  I had the Sonny Boy w/Sausage added.  I took one bite and instantly became a fan of their Pizza.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin crust.  The dough wasn't chewy or undercooked....it was just right.  The Sausage had good flavor and the Pepperoni didn't overwhelm the Pizza.  The Better Half had the Bianco Verde w/Prosciutto.  When it came out, it was covered in Greens....LOL, it looked pretty hilarious as I've never seen a Pizza that looked like this before.  It tasted pretty good though.  I had a slice and thought it would suck because of all of the greens on it....it's not something I would personally order, but my Wife enjoyed it and said she'd order it again.  The service here was pretty good.  The server was pleasant, friendly, and attentive.  I'm not sure the Pizza is worth a 2 or 3 hr wait, but it's pretty good.  We'd come back on another slow night.  Return Factor - 80%",

    "text": "What trip to Phoenix would be complete without a visit to the famed Pizzeria Bianco, which has been arguably called the best pizza restaurant in the country by more than one publication.  Located in Heritage Square, and next to the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco is a very small restaurant.  When the popularity started to mount, wait times could exceed four hours.  Although the fanfare has seemed to die down somewhat from a national standpoint, Pizzeria Bianco still attracts crowds.  In order to avoid any potential long wait in the 110+ degree weather, we got there early enough to beat the crowds and were seated immediately.  The meal started off with some nice crusty bread that was super soft on the inside along with some nice fruity olive oil.  The handmade mozzarella, tomato, basil and extra virgin olive oil salad is a take on the margherita without the bread.  The mozzarella is super fresh, the tomatoes were a little lacking in flavor and the basil added a nice herbal punch.  A classic salad with few ingredients could have been elevated with riper tomatoes and just a touch of salt.  The pizzas are cooked in the wood burning oven that dominates the kitchen and is the focal point of the restaurant.  The \"Wiseguy\" pizza includes roasted onions, mozzarella and fennel sausage.  This is a nicely balanced pizza as the roasted onions brings out the sugar in them to cut the sharpness of the fennel.   The \"Biancoverde\" pizza includes fresh mozzarella, Parmegiano reggiano, ricotta and arugula.  We added anchovies to this pizza.  The pepperiness of the arugula cuts through the richness of the cheeses.  I personally did not like this pizza, especially with the addition of the anchovies, but my dining companions loved this pizza, and was their favorite.  The \"Sonny Boy\" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami and Gaeta olives.  The saltiness of the olives totally overwhelms the rest of the ingredients.  If they were cut into smaller pieces, perhaps this would work better.  After taking the olives off, this became a much better pizza and each ingredient was able to shine on its own.  The classic \"Margherita\" pizza includes tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  We added wood roasted organic mushroom and prosciutto.  On its own, the Margherita pizza is fantastic, but the addition of the mushrooms added a nice earthy flavor while the prosciutto added just a hint of salt.  Is this the best pizza in the country?  That can be argued forever and never answered, as food is subjective.  I do applaud the freshness of the ingredients, and that everything is hand crafted.  Worth a visit when in Phoenix?  Yes.  Worth waiting four hours?  I personally wouldn't.",

    "text": "I think this restaurant may have been hyped up too much prior to my visit. It was delicious, fresh, simple, and amazing, but I still felt like I wasn't entirely impressed... I am not sure.   We ordered a caprese salad (delicious - but how could it not be?), a salad made from whatever's in season (grapefruit, carved fennel, honey comb, and a few other things - sooo good, fresh and light, unusual flavors but it paired very well), and two pizzas. Everything was great.   The only reasons I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5: 1) they were out of the original market salad (something like spinach, goat cheese, strawberries, pecans), they told us that they had some still but ran out immediately after (I was not too upset, as the replacement was great as well but my family was a bit upset). 2) The pizza here was amazing, but it was not particularly amazing in comparison with other upscale pizza joints in Phoenix. Cibo, La Piazza PHX, etc, are all delicious brick oven pizza restaurants that are magnificent and I love the style of pizza they serve, but I think they are all equal. I didn't think pizzaria bianco stood out as being the best pizza, it was just like the other highly-rated pizza restaurants in phoenix. This isnt a weakness, but rather I would say it just simply isn't a strength. I don't know... I may have had too high expectations for this place seeing as I have heard so much about it beforehand! It was still amazing though, but I would say the highiglht of my meal was the salad, not the pizza, because the salad was something unlike anything I have eaten before.",

We waited about forty minutes to get in, the place looks great but the pizza is about as Neapolitan as Hungarian Goulash.  The tomato puree is not like the real Italian tomato taste and seems flavored with sugar and citric acid, I don't know it just tastes funny.  I spend two months a year in the heart of naples and this is a very different tasting pie.  Even the mozzarella lacks the natural flavor and is so white as if it is bleached.  We were told this was the most amazing pizza around but it was no match for a few decent ones in San Francisco and on the East Coast.  This was their version of a Neapolitan pizza, not a real neapolitan Pie!",

    "text": "Dare I say - it totally lived up to the hype, based off the pizza alone. I was seriously worried about this, because I've heard SO much about it.  I can also say, having been to Italy, that this is truly authentic as well. If you are into Americanized pizza (Domino's, Papa John's, etc), you will NOT like this place. If that's you, or even if you really love NY style or Chicago style pizza, I suggest you skip this place.  It's a small place. VERY small. That's why there is almost always a wait. Also, the menu is small as well. They focus on making a few things very well, and use fresh ingredients to do so. You won't see any pepperoni, ham or pineapple here.  We were lucky, and when we got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were 2 seats open at the bar. Now my ONLY knock on this place will be how uncomfortable I was sitting there. I am tall, but not that tall (6'1\"), and I was just cramped. The bartender was very friendly and helped us with some suggestions.  Depending on how hungry you are, the pizzas could be big enough for 2 people to share. The bartender recommended, since it was our first time, that we each order our own pizza and share. I ordered the Biancoverde - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. It was REALLY good. I would definitely order this again. My friend ordered the Sonny Boy - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives. It was also really good (although I liked mine more). That salami was legit though!!  They offered a few local beers, which was awesome. The food didn't take long to prepare because of the super hot brick oven they use, which I am sure helps them turn over a huge crowd each day. Overall, this was a great lunch and I am really glad we made it. There was nothing really disappointing about it (other than my own discomfort, which was worth it). The bartender even wrote down some local bars for us to check out when we asked.   If you are in the area - it's worth a visit. Just be prepared to wait!",

We also got the flourless chocolate cake which was great too. It's more rich and dense like a brownie- which we enjoyed. The waiters are fantastic and you will never wait for drink refills, etc. The ambiance is great. If the weather is nice snag a table out front under the lights. If not, the inside is super cute with the exposed brick and pizza oven. The only downside is that you have to vallet your car but it's well worth a few bucks.",

That said we decided to order a caprese salad and the Margherita pizza to see if it was really as good as the original. The caprese was very good and all the ingredients tasted fresh but the pizza though was a little disappointing. I wasn't expecting it to be exactly like pizza in Naples but our pie at least was too burnt and the crust wasn't nearly as chewy or good as they make it in Italy. It also was lacking the copious amounts of olive oil I expected from a Naples pizza. Overall it wasn't bad but I'd say this restaurant is over-hyped.",

But I've waited over an hour in line on a weeknight to eat here, plus another 30+ minutes for cook time, and the only word that kept popping into my head was \"underwhelmed.\" How in the world is this considered one of the top pizzas in the country? The crust, while nice and thin, is also flavorless and was on the well-done side every time I've eaten here. I dig a wood-fired pizza as much as anyone, but THIS wood-fired crust left me thinking \"meh.\" It was just ok.  The atmosphere is nice, I like that it's housed in a historic repurposed building downtown. But truth be told, it's all just a little on this side of pretentious. It's good pizza, but to call it one of the best America has to offer? Not by a long shot.",

    "text": "Authentic Italian style pizza! Absolutely amazing. I can't say enough how much we love these places. We have been to the original location and the one off of Camelback, and I basically dream about this pizza. Very limited menu and not great for kids, at least my kids, but so incredibly fresh and delicious. I've never met Mr. Bianco, but I'd love to because his methods and recipes are absolutely genius. Best chef and restaurant in the Phoenix area as far as I am concerned. The biancoverde is totally my jam.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco is a True, Neapolitan style pizzeria that uses a wood-fires brick oven in order to create a great pizza.  It's a True gem in Phoenix, a place you need to visit if you're on vacation or if you're a local  My Overall Rating - 4  1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - Pizzeria Bianco is in a beautiful brick building.  There is outdoor seating, and during the sunset the building lights up and it creates a great atmosphere.  Be warned, it's small so expect a long wait during busy times.  Inside you should make your way over to view wood fired brick oven, wear fresh pizzas are baked in minutes. 1 Star.  Service - We visited on an early Sunday evening, and they were certainly busy.  We chose to sit outside in the beautiful Phoenix outdoors.  The staff was very accommodating to our large group.  It was slow at times, but I'm pretty sure that's due to their popularity.  Nonetheless it was a good experience.  1 Star.  Food - If you're a fan of Neapolitan pizza, Pizzeria Bianco will not disappoint.  This style of pizza uses freshly tossed dough to create a thin crust that gets baked in about a minute in their oven.  The result is a pizza that's pure in taste and allows the toppings to star.  Our choices included the Biancoverde - a white pizza with prosciutto and the Wiseguy - sausage & caramelized onions.  If you're a fan of prosciutto you'll love it.  The caramelized onions on the wiseguy were sweet and fit well with the sausage.  I even ordered a latte after seeing an espresso machine.  Even that was good.  It's some of the best Neapolitan style pizza I've had.  2 Stars.  Will I Return? - Probably not.  While the pizza is superb, you do have to fight the crowds.  Pizzeria Bianco is not the only Neapolitan style pizzeria I've been to.  It's great though, and is worth a visit if you've never been. 1/2 Stars.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",

There is a little place next door that you could wait at but we opted for the cute benches outside since it was a nice evening. This place has been said to have the best pizza in the U.S. so naturally, we had to try it out.   Sonny Boy Pizza w/ Sausage - Thin crust pizza. A little soggy at parts where I am guessing the sauce soaked in but there were parts that were nicely firm and thin. No complaints though because the flavor was wonderful. The tomato sauce was delicious. The fennel sausage completed the pizza. The cheese was melted and stringy when you took a bite. Yum!  Rosa w/ Sausage - This was a different kind with no tomato sauce as the base. No sauce meant a firmer pizza with no sogginess whatsoever. The flavors were interesting on this but all went together well with every bite.  Overall, I would give this place a 4. What made it a 5 was their service. Every single staff member here was friendly, fast, and paid attention to detail. They were so great! We walked out saying \"Man, they were so nice\". Great establishment.",

The wait was 45 minutes at 5:30pm on a Friday evening which was not too long, especially since we could get a drink at their bar next door and monitor the progress of the line via an app.  There are only 5 or 6 different kinds of pizza on the menu; we had the margarita, sonny boy (aka pepperoni) and the arugula/Parmesan/ricotta white pizza.  All three were very good and so was the spiedini appetizer (melted cheese wrapped in warm prosciutto).  Service felt a little rushed and impersonal but we understand they are very busy to make sure as many people as possible can enjoy their delicious pie so we forgive them!",

    "text": "OK. I'll add my voice to the masses. I can find no fault with this restaurant. The space is both charming and comfortably contemporary, the service is exceptionally efficient and helpful, and the pizza is pretty much perfect.   This was my second visit to Bianco, so I've tried a few pies. I like the brief but thoughtful list of choices, which features both red sauce pizza and a few with no sauce at all. I liked all that I tried. The Rosa is their signature pie, and I found it both unusual and delicious, with its red onion, parmesan, rosemary and pistachio combination creating just the right amount of savory flavor and texture to keep me interested throughout. The fennel sausage on the Wise Guy is spicy enough to make me sit up and take notice, and I adore the caramelized onion and smoky cheese. And the Margherita was everything I expect from that classic amalgamation...a simple tomato base with mozzarella sans peer and the freshest basil, picked just outside the door.   I had the featured green salad on both visits, and appreciated the simplicity and freshness of ingredients. The bread and olive oil they bring out with the salads is probably unnecessary, but deeply valued; I could make a meal of both these things at any other restaurant and be completely happy, given the quality of the offerings. Still hungry? Desserts are not precisely made in house, as they're made off premise, but by the same folks who made the pizza, just at another location. And delicious, by the way. Go and enjoy the care and expertise that some people bring to food.",

    "text": "HOT DAMN THIS PLACE IS GOOD!  The main reason I tagged along with my hubby on his business trip to Phoenix was to make a pilgrimage to this pizza mecca -- and despite the mind-boggling lines in front of this joint, I can happily report that the 1.5 hours we spent waiting in the sizzling Phoenix sun wait was well worth it.  After checking out all the reviews and reports on the epic waiting times here (reservations are only taken exactly 30 days in advance for parties of 6 or more at 5:00 pm, 6:30 pm, and 8:00 pm), we knew that we would have to camp out hours ahead to get a table at their first seating at 5:00 pm.  After eating some delicious sandwiches at Pane Bianco, we drove here at 2:00 pm and started scoping out the spot.  Seeing no one, we popped in and out of the air-conditioned museum next door until we spotted two parties already in line at 3:30 pm.  We quickly ran and took our spots for the long wait in the desert sun.  There was a Diamondbacks game letting out, so the place was soon packed with other hungry and sweaty pizza aficionados.  Since we had so much time to chitchat with the other people in line, a regular let us in on his favorite items.  I was so fricking hungry and hot but everyone kept on assuring me that my patience would pay off.  How the hell do people wait for a table in the summer?  Once we made it inside, we decided to order a ton.  We got the antipasto plate, Farmer's Market Salad special of the day (grapefruit with shaved fennel and parsley), and three pies (Margherita, Rosa, and Wiseguy).  The antipasto was delicious - the veggies were farm-fresh and beautifully carmelized in the wood burning oven, and the soppressata and cheese perfectly balanced them out.  My favorite part of the platter was the cannellini beans which was nicely oven-charred.  This dish contrasted well with the juicy tang of the grapefruit salad.  I was already getting full but knew that I had to grow another stomach for the main event to come.  Man, our pizzas were revelatory.  The crusts were perfect -- each had a chewy, blistered edge and a crispy, paper-thin middle.  The Margherita was the best I've eaten - period.  The Wiseguy had such a delicious smokiness from the hand-cured fennel sausage, house-smoked mozzarella, and wood roasted onions.  Mmmmm mmmmm.  My favorite pie was the Rosa.  Who knew that a pizza topped with red onion, parmigiano reggiano, pistachios, and a sprinking of fresh rosemary could taste so yummy?    We left stuffed, satisfied, and happily lugging a box of leftover pizza back to our hotel.  I am already planning our next trip back to Phoenix just for the pizza -- I kid you not.",

As time passed, and more people arrived, we began chatting.  Just wandering from conversation to conversation - very relaxed - very laidback - casual - fun.  The family in 3rd place turned out to be regulars.  They're Italian.  They chatted amongst themselves in Italian.  They chatted with the rest of us in English - with a noticeable Italian accent.  The hostess (who is a knockout!) was charming.  I have no idea about the reviews claiming that she's rude.  Get some people skills people!  Being solo, I sat at the bar.  A glass of Dos Cabesas & a Margherita with red onions & garlic.  Those of us at the bar - all strangers to each other - chatted like we were at party at our next door neighbors'.  The ambience of this former machine shop - with the wood-burning brick pizza oven - is charming & romantic.  I will have to return with my GF.  The wine was smooth and delicious.  The pizza -- now yuh gotta understand - I worked at Gino's Pizza on East McDowell before you were born -- was AMAZING!  But, that's exactly what I expected.  My mouth told me that it's so very happy I took it to Bianco, and I like to make my mouth happy.  So, go.  Expect to wait.  Relax.  Chat with people.  Have fun.  Your mouth will.  AWESOME PIZZA!

    "text": "Meh. Yeah, that was a pretty good pizza. Amazingly thin crust with the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. However, the outer rim of my pizza was pretty badly burnt and tasted awful. And the salami on the Sonny Boy is INCREDIBLY salty (yes, I know it's salami...but geez). I'd advise you to customize your own pizza when you finally get a seat and not go with the suggested combos. But enough about the food...  An hour and twenty minutes to get a seat by myself at the bar? On a Tuesday night? No way that was worth it. I suppose it's considerate of them to have a wine bar next door that patrons can wait in, but it just made me pay more money for appetizers and beer to pass the long wait. I'll admit the focaccia appetizer I got was scrumptious...but no deal breaker, by any means.  So, bottom line, if you have absolutely nothing to do with your evening, come here with a group of friends. You *might* get some comfortable seating in the wine house as you wait for who knows how long and enjoy your pies over cheerful conversation when the blue moon finally passes and you score some seats. But I'm sure you have better things to do.",

We ordered the Wiseguy and the Margherita. The Wiseguy had roasted onions, smoked mozzarella, and very delicious fennel sausage. It was my favorite of the night. The Margherita was very good as well, but was pretty standard fare.

    "text": "Someone suggested this place to me as the \"crown jewel of Phoenix dining\". I get really worried when someone whom I don't know very well tells me something like this because it's impossible to tell the development of one's palate. So I did what any Yelp!er would do, go on Yelp! and see what everyone thinks. And it didn't take long for me to see that when it comes to Pizzeria Bianco the thin line between love and hate was clearly drawn around the wait time. Similar to the law of diminishing returns in economics, I am a firm believer that there comes a point in time where eventually no matter how good the food you're waiting for is - it's just simply not worth the wait.   I think this really comes down to how much do you like pizza. If you think that Papa John's or Domino's makes the perfect pizza, I can pretty much tell you that you probably don't want to wait anymore than 30 minutes for this place. BUT if you're foodie and you can appreciate the art of pizza making in a wood burning oven, this will be 3.5 hours well spent.   Seeing how Ed Levine wrote an article in the New York Times about Pizzeria Bianco titled \"The Road to Pizza Nirvana goes through Phoenix\", I was pretty settled on trying this place out no matter how long it takes. I got there about 45 minutes before dinner service (5pm-10pm, Tues. - Sat.) and was greeted by a line of about 50 people. Once dinner service begun, the hostess took our name down on \"the list\" and estimated that it'd be about 3-3.5 hours from there (once you get your name on \"the list\" you can go on with your life as long as you call and check in about every hour).   I checked back an hour later and the hostess told me that they were running ahead of schedule for 2 tops that night and that I should close out my tab at the pub across the street and head back to the pizzeria. So when we finally got seated, my buddy and I was HUNGRY (you can do a lot of damage with a nice simple menu in front of you when you're hungry). we decided to start things off with the antipasto plate and then we ordered the \"Biancoverde\", the \"Wiseguy\", & also the \"Margherita\".  The Antipasto plate was solid. For the price, I'd say that it was about the right size. The ingredients were FRESH. The olive oil was very tasty. The \"Wiseguy\" pizza was alright. While the pizza was solid, nothing about this particular one stuck out to me. The \"Biancoverde\", however, was pretty much fail proof because we added prosciutto ($4) to it. The first thing I noticed about that pizza was that the ENTIRE pizza was covered with prosciutto. As I took my first bite, the fresh mozzarella REALLY stuck out - it made the biggest difference in the world. The \"Margherita\" was also solid - the tomato sauce was superb. I think the key here was to order the right things. For example, I was most impressed with the Biancoverde, but if it wasn't for the prosciutto that we added, I don't know if I'd still feel the same way. Don't be shy about adding things to the pizza - you've already waited so long in line, treat yourself the a pizza the way you want it!! =)  I think what makes Pizzeria Bianco a hit is that besides how they really use pretty quality ingredients, their crust is simply superb. It's got a perfect hint of the smoke aroma from the fire and also the perfect balance between the crunchy outer crust and the soft inner crust.   While I can say without a doubt that the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is awesome, I would hesitate to recommend this place to everyone. Like I said earlier, if you consider yourself a foodie, don't do yourself a disservice by skipping out on this place because of the wait time. It's like the saying that \"where there's smoke there's fire\", for ANY restaurant that can tell people to wait 3 hours for food and only do dinner service 5 days of the week while having only about 12 tables inside... you know that you're either onto something or this is the greatest scam in the US of A...  If you're on the fence about this place still, try this place with a party of no more than 2. The party of 3 that was literally right behind us in line before the open was still not seated when I was leaving the restaurant (that's after an appetizer and 3 pizzas!!!)",

    "text": "My buddy and I \"only\" waited 90 minutes. I didn't mind sitting outside on the picnic table with some appetizers and beer from Bar Bianco next door (good set up in there).   But for me I was anticipating what was going to be a mind-blowing pizza experience. We got the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, gaeta olives) and the Wiseguy (wood roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage) and in the end, they were....good. Pretty good. But not great. Not amazing. The crust was really good quality, but I was somehow underwhelmed with the pizzas as a whole, especially with all the hype surrounding this place.  I'd go again, if for any reason the wait just happens to be less than 15 minutes (which is never). Otherwise I'd just stock up on appetizers and drinks next door and call it a night.",

    "text": "I had waited to write a review for Bianco because it had been so long since I had been last, I felt I needed a refresher course. Last night I got one.   I took a date there and we were quoted an hour forty-five to two hours and 15 minutes. Seemed liked a lot for a Thursday night, but was planning on waiting. I thought the stars were totally aligned though when I was able to find a spot in their tiny parking lot. I guess it can't all be perfect. So we ventured over to Bar Bianco (review to follow) for a few drinks to pass the time. We were pleasantly surprised that in about an hour and a half they were ready for us next door.   We took the first available seating which was up at the bar. I have to say I forgot just how small this place is. The bar is nice, but we were both wishing the top of it came out a little more. It was a little awkward trying to sit on the stools straight. It does however make it more conducive to talking, almost like a table. The atmosphere was great and we even had a short conversation with a few of the other bar inhabitants.   The bartender/server was very attentive and greeted us right away. Took our drink order and he poured them right then and there. We decided to go with a Sonny Boy and the Biancoverde. Within 10 minutes, I think, they were both out and done to perfection. The salami on the Sonny Boy got nice a crispy on the edges and the olives were nice and salty. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Biancoverde. It is a white pizza with ricotta and arugula. It was nice and creamy. We ate all but two pieces and left feeling satisfied.   This is a great date place and I credit Z for suggesting it. If someone has never been downtown before take them here if you can get a table. It will surely impress them.",

Chris Bianco is one of the most humble people I have met in a long time, and his food is orgasmic...but my *only* gripe about the restuarant is that I often feel like my table is on top of someone else's table. However, the food and wine (You MUST hit up Bar Bianco during your 1hr+ wait) makes up for the lack of intimacy. I would say that I could recommend it for a first date, because you will spend at least an hour waiting for a table, so grab a bottle of wine and chat, however once seated in the restuarant, the lazy romantic atmoshere diminishes.   Great food, and the service is even better. It's is totally worth the wait.",

    "text": "First things first, if you are someone who can't relax or stand the thought of hanging out while you wait your turn, skip Bianco. The rest of us don't want to hear you whine. The fact that there are long waits is not a secret. I arrived an hour early and watched the line get to 100+ by 4:20 (they open at 5). Plan ahead - don't go when you're starving.  Only my trip to Di Fara in Brooklyn compares to Bianco experience-wise. That is to say that you go to a place with a humongous reputation and wait and wait and wait - but you don't mind the waiting. Instead, you take advantage of the fact that surrounding you are people who are there for pizza. They love pizza, too! You strike up conversations with people who are there for the first time or who go there every week. You hear about pizzerias from around the country (and sometimes globe). In the case of Bianco, you probably get to do some of this waiting in the sun or with a delicious beer from the bar in your hand. Visiting these spots is a celebration in pizza that's going to feel like a worthy experience for any pizza head.  Of course, none of it matters if the pizza doesn't make your taste buds sing. I am happy to report that mine are still singing Bianco's praises a couple weeks later. The crust is fluffy, chewy, light and flavorful. The toppings are of the finest available quality and often prepared in-house. The combinations are original and classic all at once.  If you love pizza, I encourage you to visit. Plan ahead. Treat it like a religious pizza experience and you won't mind waiting. I'm already planning my next flight back.",

    "text": "This place is reminiscent of thin-crust Neapolitan pizza I've had in Italy - who would have thought?  The first time I came here a couple years back I accidentally sprinkled salt (thinking it was fresh mozzarella) all over my pizza.  Doh!  Please note - for you newbies.    I heard the owner farms his own ingredients on-site and make his own mozzarella daily.  I usually order the Wiseguy w/ fennel sausage.    Personally I don't mind the wait - which is much shorter on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  But anything less than 2 hours is almost unheard of, so be prepared.  This place is a destination restaurant and def brings out Phoenix's own Bridge and Tunnel crowd (West Valley, East Valley, Ahwatukee, oh my).  The adjacent bar is charming and has decent wines by the glass.  Most people either love it or are so over-hyped about this place, that they can't help but feel let down.  I fall into the former category, so check out Pizzeria Bianco.",

After our meeting we headed to the restaurant and started waiting @ 3:50 (we were already the 27th in line) and we made the first seating @ 5 PM.  If you can believe it the best part of the experience was waiting in line and hanging out in the front...but then again I was with my girlfriends and we were pretty positive about the wait...we also met some really cool people local and visitors.  At the table the menu is pretty simple.  First we shared the mozzerella, tomato and basil salad and the Spiedini and for pizzas we ordered the Rosa, Sonny Boy and the Margherita.  All were good but - I've had better.  Maybe it's just me but the crust was ok (not perfectly chewy more on the crispy side) and burnt.  Maybe it's the best Phoenix has to offer?  But then again there were people who I met while waiting who say it's as good as the pizza they had in Italy - that's a strong compliment.  If you're with friends it's not a bad wait - just make sure you visit the bar next door.",

Then explain the line of people waiting, every day, even in 120 degree heat. I'll wait for your retort. If you don't want to come, good, less wait for the rest of us.  If you can't deal with the wait, and you need to hurry up and eat so that you can scurry home to see who gets voted off American Idol, then perhaps Domino's is your choice.  But I have a better plan. Make an evening of it. Sit with a glass of wine or beer and chat with your friends. Talking can be fun too. But all that drinking and chatting will never compare to the loveliness and perfection that is the pizza.  And don't think I forgot you my precious antipasto, you are my companion 'till the end.",

To be honest though, you can get the same quality pizza at Cibo's in a tiny fraction of the time that it takes your name to move up one spot on the list.  The pizza is nice.   The crust has that yummy woodfired taste with a little bit of charring that I really like.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  The items on the menu are creative yet traditional.  This just isn't my thing.  There are lots of things to like about Bianco's.  I love that he has stayed small.  I appreciate that.  I love the cute bar next door to provide some solace to the excruciatingly long wait.  I love the area it's in.  Absolutely beautiful.  I love that Bianco's is real.  Real ingredients, real cooking.    Problem is, I can get the same thing elsewhere.  Pizza will never ever be worth a multi-hour wait for me.

A few months ago, though, I finally decided to give it a try. Some family members and I met up downtown and were ready to be blown away by some incredible pizza!  We ended up waiting forever-- over two hours-- to get in. This wasn't a huge shock, so I won't really factor that into my review rating. It was a long wait, but we knew that it would be. However, it's what came after the long wait that disappointed us. Once we were finally in, it took forever for our order to come out. We were also split up into three separate groups even though our party wasn't that large. That's fine, too. They were busy and pretty packed, so I understand that.  The pizzas, though, were extremely unimpressive. Even my mother commented on how she did not really enjoy her pizza that much, especially when compared to previous experiences. My pizza was so unexciting that I don't even remember what I had ordered now, which is pretty uncommon for me! It wasn't disgusting, but it was so boring that I can't even recall eating it! I think this sentiment was shared amongst all of us that night. For the price and the hype, it just didn't live up to our expectations.  My mother also mentioned to me that Chris Bianco no longer makes the pizzas because of some allergy he has or something. Perhaps this is why the quality of the pizzas has gone down? I'm not sure, but either way I just wasn't impressed. I was so excited to eat here, too!",

The place was nice and cozy though, and the walk around the block near by was great.",

    "text": "Everything about Pizzeria Bianco is exaggerated: both the wait time and the quality. We went in with high expectations, having heard all about a New York Times article saying that Pizzeria Bianco has the best pizza in the country. We left quite a bit less than amazed.   The wine bar where we passed our time before being seated was charming, with a rustic theme suffusing the area. The wine selection was limited however, favoring reds over whites. I liked that their beer selection included a number of local breweries, but their selection was limited in that as well. For non-alcoholic selection they had Mexican Coke and Coke Light (Diet Coke) . Avoid the Coke LIght unless you like to be overwhelmed with Aspartame.  We eventually made our way to the main dining area, which strangely enough is smaller than the wine bar. We were helped quickly - you certainly cannot fault the service here, which was prompt and friendly. Then our pizza arrived.  I don't know what the opposite of synergy is, but the pizzas we ordered had it. They were less than the sum of their parts. We ordered the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy. The Wiseguy is a white pizza (no tomato sauce) with smoked mozzarella, sausage, and smoked onion. The Sonny Boy is a standard pizza with salami, olives, mozzarella, and tomato sauce.   The Sonny Boy's ingredients were lost in the melange of the pizza as a whole. There was no clarity of taste from the salami. It was more a texture than a taste, and the texture was leathery. The salami reminded me of prosciutto rather than salami: very thin and salty. But with the mozzarella and tomato sauce, the salty taste disappeared into a void. The salami also looked a tad raw, salmon pink in areas rather than red.   The pizza was also somewhat small. I felt like I paid sixteen dollars for a ten dollar pizza. I could not help but wonder whether the writer of the famous New York Times article had ever eaten pizza before.    The Wiseguy was not much better. Given that there were so many smoked ingredients on the pizza, the pizza did not taste smoky at all. It was an okay pizza. Certainly not bad, but also very certainly not the best in the country; not by a long shot. It is not the best pizza in Phoenix, or even the best pizza in the neighborhood. So far, that goes to Cibo.   It is not a bad place at all. The crust is crispy as one would expect from a wood-fired oven, although I question the wisdom of placing said oven in the restaurant. Phoenix is hot enough without placing a colossal heat source a few feet away from the seating area.   I think that having so many rave reviews actually enhanced our disappointment with the restaurant. We went in expecting to be blown away and left with some sort of existential malaise.   I can recommend Pizzeria Bianco, but only with reservations. The pizza is  above average, but Phoenix abounds with mediocre restaurants so the bar is not very high. There are better Pizzerias in Phoenix; Cibo and Le Grande Orange come to mind immediately. LGO even uses many of the same ingredients as Pizzeria Bianco, but with far better effect.   In essence:  don't believe the hype. Eat here if you want good pizza. Don't eat here if you want amazing, best in the country pizza.",

    "text": "OK...so I moved to town about 8 months ago and FINALLY made it to what I had heard was The Holy Grail for pizza.  I was prepared for the wait and arrived a good two hours before I planned on partaking in the feast that I had heard so much about.  I have got to admit, I LOVE the atmosphere and love the beer/wine bar next door as well as the English place across the street.  Its all part of it....and the charm is unlike much of anything that I am accustom to in the Southwest.  I almost felt like I was in New England or even the Carolina's.  It has a wonderful old world charm.  OK.  So its finally time and we get seated at a wonderful and cozy table by an absolutely charming hostess.  Really made me feel special.  We perused the menu and ordered three  that seemed would be a perfect complement to one another and 15 minutes later they arrived.  Ehhh.  So, so.  Fair.  One of them said on the menu that it came with a marinara based sauce had no sauce whatsoever.  At least nothing recognizable.  When we asked if there was any way at all that we could get some sauce on the side (and we knew that Bianco doesnt roll with that) we were politely told that they do not do that BUT they would make us another one if we wished.  I mean that is a wonderful offer...but we couldnt bare to see a decent pizza get wasted.  It just needed a little sauce!  So we told them \"no thanks...it's fine\".  Ingredients are fresh, service great and atmosphere really kinda special but once again, the pizza isnt that out of this world.  But I guess you've got to do it because it is after all \"Pizzeria Bianco\".  And I will be back.  Probably quite a few times.  I loved the experience.  But for a woodfired pizza...with quality without the ego (to not allow a side of sauce to come out) there are a few places I'd pick first.  So long and short (I have to believe) is that you should communicate with the waitstaff as to what you enjoy in a pizza without presuming that it comes with things we take for granted like a good red sauce.  I have a hunch that if you do you are probably guaranteed to enjoy your za when it shows up.    Chow!",

Why would I go out of my way to drive downtown Phoenix for pizza ? Just because I am crazy and don't mind driving for food doesn't mean Pizzeria Bianco ranks at the top of my list.  There is a pizzeria just up the street from where I live and he makes bomb pies...check it out its on the northeast of Pinnacle Peak and Pima roads in Scottsdale...I won't reveal the name so you can go on a little treasure pie hunt...enjoy!

    "text": "Three stars because it is very average. Not bad, though. Our definition of pizza is what one gets in Naples. This place doesn't disappoint in terms of crust--it is wood fired. Their red sauce is good, also. However, the parmesan is melted, and the mozerella is stringly. All the cheese is overdone. The menu choices are limiting---the combinations offered are Americanized. You'd do well here to make off menu requests, probably. The Sonny Boy would be better if the olives were sliced---the presentation of whole olives on the pie is luxe, but the bite, while delicious, is too overwhelming. The rocket (arugula) on the biancoverde was not baby rocket, and it was dull--a bit past its freshness date, and with no spicy zing. The cheese was overwhelming, and overall flavor was bland. Would not order it again. This place is in a good location and is priced high --and hyped up--for tourists, although many locals love this place. Our lunch bill for two pies, two salads, two peronis and one glass of house wine was $77, not including the tip. If you want True Napoli pizza at a much better value (& less touristy), go to Pomo, a place which feels more Italian, has better cocktails, authetic Italian desserts, and is (slightly) less expensive.",

You can go next door to the bar while you wait for seats to open up which is nice that you don't have to wait outside.   Be prepared to wait, but the Pizza is definitely worth it. The menu constantly changes which spies things up. Overall, I would recommend Pizzeria Bianco to anyone just would caution that they could potentially wait for an hour or two before they actually get seated.

But that's not even the worst of it. First, they make you valet your car and then charge you for it. That's not cool. Then we opened the menu and found the smallest list of (mostly meat) toppings for their pizzas. It's great that one pizza comes without cheese, but when we asked if they had other veggies for toppings, we were offered mushrooms and anchovies. Yes, she said anchovies were vegetables. We thought we'd see if we could get sliced tomatoes on our pizzas, but the waitress discouraged it because it'd be really soggy. Um, what? Way to sell your pizza. Turns out it's really soggy anyway. Sadly, we had a pretty bad experience and won't be returning. But now we know.",

    "text": "We had a friend from Italy who came to visit, and heard PB is the best in town, so we thought this would be the restaurant of choice. There really is a lot of HYPE about Pizzeria Bianco that I don't really understand now that I've eaten here.   Came here on a friday night and put our names down. We were told it would be about 1 hour to 1:45 minute wait. It really is a tiny place, that fits only about 30 people maximum. So we walked over to Bar Biano next door.  Once we finally got seated after waiting about 1:30 minutes, we ordered fairly quickly since we were famished.   I ordered the biancoverde pizza & added red sauce. My italian friend said you can't have a pizza without red/tomato sauce. It also came with ricotta, mozzarella cheese topped with argula. My friend ordered the Margarita pizza (mozzarella & basil).   The food took another 20-25 minutes. We thought bread was complimentary but apparently you have to order it.   No matter how great the food is, a 2-hour wait to me is just ridiculous. I was forewarned but I didn't free like this was a one-of-a-kind pizza place. Don't get me wrong I LOVE wood-fired pizza but it's just too long of a wait.    My Italian friend said the pizza crust was good, but he had an issue with the cheese saying it wasn't ''authentic''. My guess is many places in the Valley won't truly have ''authentic'' Italian cheeses.  The pizza was definitely delicious.. my crust was slightly burned but I ate the whole pie by myself!  Bottom line: Don't come here hungry. Expect to wait. and Come with good friends since you'll have PLENTY of time to catch up.",

A group of early 1900s houses holds 3 restaurants and a bar. The mozzarella salad was served with a fresh heirloom tomato and just the right amount of seasoning. We ordered olives and had the choice of black, green, or a mix. We chose the latter and enjoyed immensely. Hubby got Margherita pizza and I had parmigiana cheese, red onion, and pistachio. They were made in front of us in a cool brick wood fired oven. They were nicely proportioned, not overwhelming on any ingredient. We sat at the counter and the bartender was friendly. The employees had good camaraderie and everyone helped everyone. The restaurants validate parking in a lot next door or you can pay $5 for valet.",

Other times we made a reservation and walked around downtown Phoenix or checked out the Science Museum and came back to eat.  Either way this place is worth the wait!  My favorite pizza is the Biancoverde and the Margherita.  I've also had the Rosa and enjoy that too.

Water was brought to our table, and then nothing for the next ten minutes.  We watched the staff walk by us time and time again.  The tiny restaurant was about three-quarters full.  We ordered the Local Organic Greens Salad,  which was fine for what it was lettuce with wine vinaigrette on it.  And, we ordered the Sonny Boy  pizza.  The pizza did not taste good or bad, it just tasted like nothing. Simply, flavorless.  I would rate higher if the service was better, but no one ever came back to check on us.  We were hungry so we ate the pizza, paid our bill and left, as they thanked us on the way out for coming in.  Typically, we tip at least 20%.  We were so stunned by the lack of service we only tipped 10%.  And honestly, that was to high for the service we received.  Maybe it us, maybe we our not hip enough for this place, but Pizzeria Bianco is in my opinion way over hyped.",

Over priced ..the green salad..greens and 3 green olives...bland dressing..$6..pizzas good but really not worth the wait nor cost.  2. Requesting Parmesan will cost you $2, and they will not let  you take it unless you request it. 3. Customer service, I've had really better service other places. This past week, I was in there for a lunch meeting and this group of 25 came in complaining they couldn't sit together, giving our small table dirty looks and sarcastic comments geared towards our table.  The waitress was staring us down  the entire time on and it was a really uncomfortable feeling, especially when you are paying a high menu price for the food .  I will be taking my business somewhere else, Bianco is just not worth it nor the wait time.",

I was actually expecting the Rosa to be my favorite with the interesting combo of pistachios, parmesan and rosemary...but with all that savory deliciousness, I felt it needed something sweet to balance it out... maybe caramelize the onions or drizzle some honey on top?  ...to me, that would make it a knockout pizza. The Sonny Boy had the most wonderful olives on it... even if you don't like olives, you will like this pizza. And the Wise guy actually turned out to be our favorite... it was a little more classic in the flavor combos, but it just had that perfect balance I found a little wanting in the Rosa.  Thanks for bringing me back to NYC!  P.S. Go at lunchtime... no wait!",

    "text": "From walking into the front door to leaving fully and happy....22 minutes. If you come on a weekday at 11am, you'll be seated almost immediately. Unless you really want to tell your friends about waiting in line for 3 hours to get pizza, then I highly suggest you come here for lunch instead of dinner.   The best thing about this place is that you can split the pizzas in half when ordering. Half of the pizza was a ROSA, which comes with red onion, parmesan, rosemary and pistachios. The other half was marghertia, which was pretty basic with tomato Sauce, mozzarella, basil. I'm glad we did the half and half because I would not have enjoyed a full ROSA. The rosa was a pretty unique creation with the pistachios, but I know I would have been tired of it if I had to have more than 3 pieces. The marghertia, although simple, was a great complement to the rosa and was very fresh and flavorful. The pizza took me back to my days in Italy.....albeit my days in italy were only 2 months ago, I did have flashbacks of sitting by the Trevi Fountain looking out for gypsies while devouring my perfectly crafted pizza.   Overall, my friend and I split a pizza so the whole meal was only $13. We were both full, but then again we are okay with eating small portions. We got our food within 8 minutes of ordering. We had plenty of attention from the staff and I liked the coziness of the atmosphere. I'm a sucker for brick establishments.  I would not suggest waiting anymore than 35 minutes to eat here, after 30 minutes of hunger you get grouchy and whatever you eat will taste delicious to you. And when you are super hungry, you tend to devour your food instead of tasting it. If you come here to devour, you won't appreciate the pizza as much. This pizza is meant to be savored and tasted.   P.S. They do have a parking lot, but there is a $3 for parking in it. There are some metered parking spots on the block over, which is about a 1.50 for an hour.",

    "text": "I have been to the mountain top and it is good. Did you know our fair city, Phoenix, AZ had a nationally recognized, top ten pizzaria in the country? I know right?   Today I did what any self respecting pizza lover would do, I made it my priority to go to Pizzeria Bianco's for lunch. First off its in a great little area of Downtown Phoenix, Heritage Park. I walked through the park from the parking structure (don't forget to get a validation) to the pizzeria. For lunch time it was relatively quiet. There was a business lunch happening to my right and a woman and her two children directly in front of me. I sat at the bar and ordered the Margherita. I watched as my pie was placed in the wood burning stove. It wasn't long before I was greeted with an amazing looking meal.   Fresh mozzarella, tasty, TASTY organic tomato sauce (which you can buy for the low low price of $9 DOLLARS A BOTTLE!!) and the best part, the basil. Yes that's right, on top of pizza mountain there is fresh basil growing in abundance. The combination of the mozzarella, tomatoes and basil accompanied with the oven fired crust made me a very happy boy. I decided against my better judgement not to eat the entire meal. I wanted to save some for my wife to try. My intent was to eat half, then, I was only going to eat three pieces. Soon I said to myself \"I'll just take the small piece and leave two more.\" My only hope is I can shame myself into holding on to the last two pieces to bring home to the Mrs.   After my meal it was back to the garage, jump in the car and off to work. When I went to turn my ticket in, $12 was the charge for 36 minutes of dining. Wow $12? Did I park in Dubai? Am I supposed to pay in gold bullion? Luckily I received a validation ticket from the resturant which immediately freed me from the underground parking without cost. Go to Pizzeria Bianco, you deserve it. ($22 bucks is a lot to spend on lunch. Don't do it too often or you'll be a poor man)",

    "text": "11/2/2016 Pizzeria Bianco 623 E Adams St Phoenix, AZ 85004 (602) 258-8300  Pizzeria Bianco has been considered some of the best pizza in the United States and over the years has had thousands of people enter its doors. I have a personal connection to Pizzeria Bianco not just because I am from Phoenix, AZ, but because I have been going there since I was six years old. The small restaurant located on the corner of Heritage Square in Downtown Phoenix can sometimes be extremely busy. I remember waiting hours just to eat and personally I thought the wait was worth it. As you enter the small space the inside of the restaurant has very dimmed light and familiar faces serving you. Now 20 years old, the same servers are there from when I was six years old smiling and greeting you.  In the back you can see the wood oven where the pizzas are made. It is rare to find oven baked pizza in Arizona so this is one of the few places where is made in a wood oven. Yes, the space inside is small so you better be comfortable with sitting close to some strangers, but that doesn't really matter while you are enjoying your food.   As for the wait, may people tend to complain how the wait can be really long. It honestly depends on the time a day you go. For example, I tend to go a lot during the day for lunch the wait is usually less than 15 minutes, whereas if you are going on Thursday-Saturday the wait can be anywhere from 30 minutes- 2 hours. I personally don't mind the wait, there is a lot to do around the square and now they opened up the space next-door as a bar.   Now let's talk about the food! Some of my favorite dishes to get are the margarita pizza and the caprese salad. I love the caprese salad because it has fresh mozzarella made there at Bianco's. Personally, I love my crust nice and toasty and the thin bread makes it all better. Now prices vary at Pizzeria Bianco, it usually varies from $11-30, which personally I don't think it is that bad for the quality of pizza and service you are getting. As for drinks, there isn't a lot of variety if you are under the age of 21, but the ginger ale they have is good! I will argue that they have a great selection of wine and beers at Pizzeria Bianco. I usually get the ginger ale or a simple tea.   Our server, Alberto always greets us when he sees us. He has been at Pizzeria Bianco for quite some time. It is nice to see the same faces at this place especially if there is a lot of memories and laughs you share at the restaurant. When you have gone so long it feels somewhat like home. I love Pizzeria Bianco, I love the food, I love the ambiance, but most importantly I love the people that are always so kind.",

Now, I would have given them 5 stars except for the fact that their waiting system sucks.  I'm glad I read the reviews first before I went, because I would have been so confused.  We arrived at 4:00 and there were people already waiting, but not in a line like we were taught in school.  They're just dispersed here and there.  It's so easy for people to cut in line, which they did.  We were lucky though.  We were still pretty close to the front and since it was just the three of us, we got in the first seating.   Our waiter  was great.  He was quick and attentive, but didn't rush us.  We ordered the antipasto, margherita, biancoverde, and the wiseguy.  Everything was delicious!  Even the olive oil that was served with the bread!  I love how the crust has that charcoal stuff on it; crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. But I wonder...why was it so good?  Was it because I waited so long?  Because I drove 5 1/2 hours for it?  Because Oprah said it is the #1 pizza in America?  Who knows, but I did. Would I do it again?  Eh, maybe not.  :)",

I have to admit, I thought that the line for this place they explained to me was a bit ridiculous, but the pizza was great.  We got to the restaurant at 4:00 to start waiting in line for them to open at 5:00.  Fortunately, we were the very last ones seated in the first group.  Those after us in line had to wait for another two hours from what I noticed, so make sure you get there early!  There is a wine bar next door if you want to take turns waiting in line with your friends or to wait at once your name is on the list.  Three of us ordered two pizzas and each got the farmer's market salad.  I highly recommend the salad!  You can make reservations for parties larger than six or eight I believe.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the lack of common sense of the staff far outweighs the pizza in our experience. We went last night for what was supposed to be a nice 'date night' with my husband. We knew the weather was unpredictable, but decided to go early and wait for the doors to open because we know it is always busy. At approx 4:45 (restaurant opens at 5:00) a terrential downpour hit PHX. The only cover outside the restaurant is a shade screen, which is not water proof so it was pouring through on all of us as we huddled together against the unbelievable wind and rain. The front of the restaurant is all glass, the staff saw all of us out there getting drenched. At about 4:50 large sized hail began to pelt us. While running to a car for cover might have seemed like a good idea to an outsider, it had rained so hard it was flooding all around us, plus the wind, rain and the hail. Literally, all the staff was inside watching us outside and they did NOTHING. It appeared one of the guys was going to open the door but another guy said something to him and he backed away. At 4:55, a waitress opened the door far enough to stick out her head and told us the place next door was open and that we should go over there. Seriously, are you kidding me? I asked why she couldn't just let us in and she nodded her head 'no' and closed and LOCKED the door. Unbelievable, when they finally opened the door, at 5:00, they did nothing for us, they offered no comps and zero apology or understanding. So, while their pizza is pretty good, it's not going to make up for their lack of common sense and the memory of them watching all of us, small children included, standing in the pouring rain and hail, and doing nothing about it. Joe's pizza in Scottsdale is very good and we'll gladly try Classic Italian Pizza in Tempe as it's obvious from Pizza Bianco's treatment of its customers that it cares about money, not people.",

    "text": "The Background: * on a nippy and overcast afternoon 4 of my restaurant colleagues and I patiently waited 2 hours and 45 min. for a table. * My first exposure to Pizzeria Bianco (PB) was while reading Peter Reinhart's book \"American Pie\" in 2004. * I am a research Chef - my job entails depth of research on various food items. I've done extensive research on Pie's around the US and have dined at some of the most reputed pizzerias throughout the country.  The Story: * After reading several of the reviews here I've concluded that PB is not for everyone.  I won't go into details about how incredible this place is or how every inch of PB can be summed by a quote from Chris Bianco in the book \"American Pie\" - \"Pizza is my metaphor, and I believe my mission in life is to make the best pizza in the world.  I really do.\"  I won't fill this review gleaming about the spiedini appetizer that my group of 5 professional foodies actually wanted to play \"paper, rock, scissors\" over for the last piece.  If you've done your research you already know that Bianco's \"metaphor within the metaphor\" of his pizza's  is the Rosa. And you should already know that the Rosa experience is the experience of all experiences in the world of pizza's while maybe actually being the best pizza in the world!  But you don't have to hear that from me.  What I want to talk about is the actual experience of PB - because if you are going to PB for the best pizza in the world then your expectations will fall far short of that goal - In summation you go to Pizzeria Bianco for everything - the wait, the conversation before the seating, the excitement of actually getting into the place and then finishing with the bragging rights to say you've been there, done that, and hopefully got a copy of the menu or at least a t-shirt (like I did).  What to expect: * a wait - all of the rumors are True. You will wait to get on the wait list and then the cuties who take the names will give you an estimate of the time you will wait to get a table - that wait is pretty accurate so don't think that the Pizza Gods will part the clouds and drop pies from heaven any minute sooner than your first estimate.  If you have a difficult time holding a conversation for more than 30 minutes - stay home and order the new butter crust pizza from Domino's. Trust me, you'll be better off. * Adverse weather during your wait.  Let's face it, Scottsdale is not known for it's cool temps and rainy days.  You see where I'm going with this? * Great conversations, no distractions, anticipation.  All of these components make for a great meal at any place in the world.  PB provides you with slightly more opportunity to indulge in bonding.  I found out that I actually enjoy spending some down time with my co-workers.  We had a great time waiting, drinking, texting, eating olives, nibbling on cheese (offered at Bar Bianco next door) and chatting. * Artisan Pizza - No this is not your average Wolfgang Puck pizza, nor is it a deep dish Chicago, and don't even compare this to a \"thin crust\" NY pizza.  This is classic Neapolitan style pizza at it's finest. * great Ingredients - Pistachio's, prosciutto, red onions, etc, etc...  All of it is quality and great. * Professional waitstaff - some peeps may be turned off by a waiter who does not stumble over words and descriptors. some peeps also don't like to get recommendations from a waiter nor do they like to have said professional waiter in a t-shirt.  You see where I'm going here? * A small 40 seats (or so) restaurant with a very small menu. * An older crowd.  I mention this because it's relevant for  two reasons. 1. Disposable income 2. A general need for simple cuisine done really well 3. quite a bit more patience than your average 23 year old and 4. usually well versed the finer things in life. (I know I said 2 things...) * Some of the best Neopoliton pizza you can have without traveling to Italy.  What not to Expect: * Instant gratification. * An American dining experience. * The best pizza in the world or even the best pizza in the U.S.  That designation is very personal and very subjective.    The Slice: * I think I could have had the best pizza in the world had I had dinner with Miriam Leone and drove off in a black Ferrari F430 to a suite at the Phoenician - but I digress....  For me - Pizzeria Mozza is the best pizza in the country, I've had some great Neopoliton pizza consistently at Il Ritrovo in Sheboygan (of all places), and I love Grimaldi's coal fired pizza in NY but really every single one of those places is distinctly different.  If I could give PB another star I would - primarily because the EXPERIENCE was one of the best food trips I've ever made.  The Pizza is great as was everything we had at PB.  I highly recommend the place only if you can maintain an open mind (if you look at some of the worst reviews here you will have a difficult time understanding what was actually bad about the food).   * Pizzeria Bianco FTW!",

    "text": "My husband and I heard about this place on the food channel and made it a goal to visit while we were in Phoenix. We heard from the locals about the long line and decided to set aside time to just experience it. An experience it is. We arrived about an hour before it opened, just to get on the waiting list. Our wait was 2 1/2 hours of which we spent sitting outside having a couple drinks and appetizers from the bar. Everyone else waiting seemed to be in good spirits and made for good company. No one seemed upset at the wait as all of us were there for the same thing. A taste of what ever was creating the wonderful smell drifting from the pizzeria. Periodically a greater would come by just to verify that those on the waiting list were still waiting.   Once inside the incredibly quaint pizzeria, we were greeted by friendly staff and waiter. We never felt rushed and simply enjoyed some of the best pizza we ever had. The atmosphere is enjoyable and relaxing. We spent around $100 because we wanted to, not because we had to. The pizza is around $11-15 each which is very reasonable.   Should you decide to visit, be prepared to spend time waiting. Be prepared to enjoy yourself and relax. Be prepared to have a conversation with other people around you. Most of all, be prepared to have to endure smelling the incredible pizza for 2 hours before you can eat any. This restaurant is about the experience, and it is an enjoyable one. We will return the next time we have the opportunity to visit Phoenix.",

    "text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said in over 400 previous Yelp reviews, on Food Network, in Gourmet Magazine and in Zagat?    I've been coming to Phoenix for four years on a regular a basis for business and only now was a I able to get in.  My many previous attempts ended in failure either because a) I was here on Monday when PB is closed or b) I wasn't willing to wait the usual 2.5 hours.  Even at 9:30pm on a sweltering Tuesday night, the wait was still 45 minutes.  So we went next door to Bar Bianco, had a couple glasses of wine, some excellent olives and a fontina and flatbread app that was a nice surprise accompanied with some sweet pickle slices.    Almost exactly 45 minutes later (excellent estimating on their part) we were summoned over for the Main Event.  I ordered the spiedini starter - essentially a slug of fontina wrapped in prosciutto and grilled on a skewer - it was incredible.  My dining companion and I went on divergent pizza paths: he ordered the wiseguy - nominally a white pizza with perfectly caramelized onions, mozarella and fennel sausage.  I went with a classic margherita pizza, but added fennel sausage.  Mine was quite good, with a very thin crust, good tomato sauce and just enough mozzarella and plenty of sausage.  A little more basil would've been good and the crust was a little thinner than I would've preferred around the edges - usually my biggest complaint with neopolitan style pizzas.  My dining companion (a crusty, New York Puerto Rican) and I traded slices and ended up liking each other's better.  His wiseguy pizza was excellent - with a slightly thicker crust around the edge was was both crisp and soft with a very slightly sweet taste, which could've been a residual from the amazing sweet onions which topped to pizza.  Even my crusty companion grudgingly admitted that Bianco's pizza was excellent - though he reserved first place on his list for Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.    Bottom line is: you gotta go.  Try not to wait 2.5 hours in the searing Phoenix heat if you can avoid it, but don't make the same mistake I did and wait four years to make your first visit.",

    "text": "In spite of its praise, Bianco divides opinions sharply.  At Bianco's you will receive a good, freshly made pizza with natural ingredients that are a cut above those of many Phoenix restaurants.  The setting is pleasant and yes, the owner's dedication to his craft is admirable.    However, I'm not sure this is worth the hype.  It's definitely a solid pizza, but nothing worth raving over.  To insinuate that this is anywhere close to the best pizza in America is lunacy.  After hearing raves about its near-legendary status, my companions and I were bewildered by the slavish praise.  That's right - no divisions, we were all unanimously confused.  I got everyone to go with me and wait because I swore the place had a magnificent reputation for unique pizzas....I still get grief about how I hyped Bianco to them.  The only explanation I can think of is that the average American palate has become so dulled by the daily intake of synthetic flavors, frozen pap, and junky Domino's-style fixes that fresh food automatically blows their minds by comparison.    Obviously, the pizza at Bianco's is going to crush anything from a lame corporate chain ala Olive Garden, but that shouldn't be an accomplishment in and of itself.  If that's the extent of your exposure, then yes - Bianco's will rock your world.  On the other hand, if you have a passion for food and some broader exposure to other cities and countries, I'm sure Bianco will seem like what it is: good, yet wholly unremarkable.  And it does have its flaws, such being sopping wet and having a totally soggy crust in the 50% near the center.   Really, instead of waiting needlessly, go to nearby Cibo, which is in a quaint house setting and serves a a solid pizza that is as good with no wait, no hassle, no hype.    I don't mind waiting: a leisurely pace can be part of a pleasant dining experience....what I don't like is waiting needlessly for something that was supposed to be mind-blowing.  Look, I'm not going to go overboard with a knee-jerk reaction: Bianco is worth trying, just temper your expectations because it's certainly nothing to write home about.",

We just sat and had a drink and enjoyed ourselves.  They finally called us and it was totally worth the wait. The pizza was amazing. The pizza crust was the best ever and the salads were just as impressive. We tried several menu items, probable too many, and not one thing was disappointing.  The owner is the only person to work on the pizzas. He gets up early every morning and goes to his local suppliers and farmers and gets his ingredients for the day. You can tell by his food that he cares about what he is doing. I cant say enough good things about this place. If anyone is going to be in the Phoenix area check to see the hours and try it.

Pizzaria Bianco seemed to be the place with the most buzz; despite my trepidation about the long waits, I was curious as to what all the chatter was about.   My companion and I rolled in about 7:30 that Saturday night, talked to a friendly hostess, and were told that the wait was 2 1/2 hours. I'd anticipated this, so we went off to run some errands during the wait. We also killed some time in the \"bar next door.\" (One might also call it an ingenious scam, since certainly no one in Bar Bianco was there to drink but to eat Bianco pizza, and with all that room they could expand the establishment or at least serve pizza out on the patios, which they don't appear to do.) Upon seating, about 2 hours into said wait, we ordered a Wise Guy (onion, smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage) and a Biancoverde (mozzarella, Parmesan, ricotta, arugula); the waiter kindly steered us in the direction of putting red sauce on our Wise Guy, so we'd not have two all white pizzas. In the end, we enjoyed it this way, but I'm still curious about the intended flavor of the Wise Guy. The Biancoverde was authentic, rich, and purely delicious. Some might call it too much, too heavy, but it suited my taste that night. And, to agree with some other reviewers, the pizza was mostly crisp, but then soggy toward the center.  I wouldn't call the pizza at Pizzaria Bianco the best in the world, country, or even my personal experience; nor would I call it worth a 2-3 hour wait. But I would call it a worthy meal. The atmosphere is trendy and warm, the staff is attentive, and the prices are perfectly reasonable. Give it a go if you have the time. I recommend attending as an individual or a couple, so you're in faster -- the hostess will offer to bump you up on the list if there's room at the bar.",

Four of us arrived at 11:30 AM. The place had only been open for 30 minutes, but it was already packed. We took 4 seats at the bar and ordered the Market Salad, Biancoverde, and Wise Guys.   The pictures posted on Yelp of the Wise Guys had me drooling since the night before.  Perfect last meal for our AZ trip.  I'm not a fan of pizza at all (I know, I know...), but I love woodfired oven pizzas. I love the crisp crunch of the crust (alliteration, anyone?), and the smoky flavor of the oven that gets infused into the whole pie.  And Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint.  The Wise Guys hit all the right spots - the sausage was flavor perfection, and don't even get me started on the caramelized onions cut so thick that it was almost an extra layer of meat on the pie. The flavors were so simple, but melded together perfectly.  The Biancoverde was amazing as well - the fresh greens tossed on top as soon as the pizza came out of the oven was just wilting but still had even bite to it.  And the cheese on these pies...  I'm just counting the days until they open one in LA...",

The place was quaint and rather small with a large wood burning stove in the corner.  I ordered the Sonny pizza and within a few minutes it came out, and it was just the way I like it - the crust was very thin and the edges were crispy and light.   The only thing that would have made this a 5 star was the only soda choices were coke, Diet Coke and sprite.  Would've loved a Dr. Pepper!",

I would say it was good, not great, and definitely not the best pizza I've ever had.  Perhaps people are biased in the Southwest and haven't had the fortune of having good pizza.  I've had better all over NY and California.    Service was just okay.  A decent meal if you're in the area but I really don't understand all the hype.",

There is $5 valet right in front for unlimited hours or around the corner there is a parking garage where the first hour is free and then it's around $1/hour afterwards. If you don't care or know you'll spend less than....5 hours there, I'd opt for the parking garage but once we got the valet we just opted for it.  The space is very small and very homey and cute. The pizza is absolutely delicious!! Thin, thin crust topped with flavorful items such as salami, tomatoes, and cheese. The pizza options are limited but every single one sounds phenomenal. They offer some nice salads and antipastos to go with your pizza. One pizza (along with a salad) fed two fairly hungry people.   A really nice place to eat some really good pizza!",

    "text": "After hearing such great Fanfare of this place for the last three to four years of working in and out of Phoenix I was able to give it a try today. Let's sum it up really quickly;  the pizza while decent nowhere near great.   The wait, 35 minutes for mediocre food, not good.   The staff, they're not very friendly and did not provide bread before the meal, but all the surrounding tables did and they totally could not understand what we ordered.   We asked if they could make a custom Pizza AKA add or remove different ingredients. We were told that they have a Marketplace pizza and they could add different things from their Pantry we said cool thanks. When our food came out in addition to  our order was another Pizza which apparently was their Marketplace Pizza, it had three fried eggs on it and was not one but we ordered to what we asked for on it three that we want another pizza at all.  When biting into the pizza my girlfriend gagged which is obsurd as her favorite food is pizza. She basically ate crust for lunch. How can such an \"amazing\" pizza place mess up pizza...  We were going to ask for a coworker how long the wait would be to place a to go order pizza but figuring how much of a language barrier there already was we decided to not even try.  We did however order a loaf of bread and while hard and old it was quite tasty. Would have been nice if we got a couple slices of that with some butter and/or oil before our meal though.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!",

    "text": "Been going here since Bianco himself was making pies at the oven. That was also when it was normal to have 2-3 hour wait at nearly any given time.   Fast forward to this recent visit: (+): -Excellent buffalo mozzarella caprese starter. The cheese was very fresh and perfectly salted; the tomatoes were tasty.  -The Wiseguy and Rosa pizzas were the usual expected flavors. You can not go wrong with Schreiner's sausage!  (-): -$5 service fee +tip to valet park. This is el cheapo move on the place if you're already patronizing the joint.  -The whole joint needs a good scrubbing!  It gets more grimy and dirty with each visit. The bathroom was not tidy. Reason for the 3 stars.  -The crust. Seems that it's a smidge thinner (yes it's already thin) but the crust had tad more chew and less cracker feel in the past. Also, way too many burn spots on the crust edge. Bianco used to monitor those with just enough to add flavor but not mouthful of char.   Overall, we prefer this Bianco's rather than the one at T&C because we feel the oven produces better flavor. We also enjoy seeing the long time employees hustling around making sure things are moving like clock-work.",

No big deal because they have a building next door that serves a huge selection of wines and a bewildering list of whiskeys.   We had the margherita and wiseguy pizzas and an assortment of sides. These guys are so good that they even make beets taste delicious.  Also, they have a garden with a long table between these old brick buildings where you can sit and talk.

Fresh, top quality and the flavors really jumped out at me.  The thin crust is definitely worth the trip in itself. It's the best I've had in years. Service was friendly, informative and warm.  One thing to know is there is valet parking which costs $5.00 plus tip (as we were told by the valet, independent of the restaurant).  A bit noisy at lunchtime with a lot of kids because there's a park and science building in the compound.  However, great vibes here and great food. I'd return to try other types of pizza.",

    "text": "Many magazines and articles proclaimed that Pizzeria Bianco is the best pizza place in the United States and this is the pizzeria that started the artisanal pizza movement. In fact, chef and owner Chris Bianco won the James Beard award in 2003. This original Pizzeria Bianco is located in Heritage Square and right next to the ASU (Arizona State University) Downtown Phoenix campus, but there is also another branch located about 6 miles away from here.  Parking: If you drive around the block, there's a parking garage at North 5th Street (right next to the Arizona Science Center) and Pizzeria Bianco will validate your parking ticket. The restaurant also offers valet parking, but the valet driveway was completely blocked with cars when we came here.  Wait time: First of all, the restaurant closes at 9 PM sharp. However, the staff will still let your party come in if you are already on the waiting list before 9 PM. Our group came here at 8 AM and the staff told us the estimated wait time was 75 minutes. One of our friends went elsewhere for dinner as he let his hungriness dictated his final dinner decision. Ultimately my other friend and I stuck around and were able to get a table at 9 PM.  Menu: A very simple menu - 6 different pizzas, 3 salads, 2 small bites, and half a dozen extra bites. You are allow to split one pizza into two different options, but you will be paying the one with higher price. I got half Sonny Boy ($19 for whole pizza) and half Margherita ($16 for whole pizza) and the whole pizza ended up $19 and not $17.50. My friend ordered one glass of Dragoon Brewing IPA and he claimed that it was the best alcoholic beverage he ever had. He checked their website later and only to learn that Dragoon Brewing IPAs are only available in the Tucson and Phoenix market.  ***  Half Sonny Boy [tomato Sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, olives] and half Margherita [tomato sauce, oregano, garlic and no cheese] ($19): Toasty thin crust pizza with soggy (in a good way) center. Margherita was EXCELLENT with light and flavorful tomato sauce. Sonny Boy is essentially salami version of Margherita, but I think salami tasted a bit oily. Sonny Boy was still a very good pizza, but I personally prefer Margherita.  ***  If you are a fan of thin crust pizzas with amazing tomato sauce, then you will love this place. Personally Pizzeria Bianco is for sure one of the best pizzerias that I have ever had in my life because I am a big fan of thin crust pizzas.  P.S. - Pizzeria Bianco is currently planning to open one location in Los Angeles (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fla.eater.com%2F2017%2F8%2F25%2F16199116%2Fchris-bianco-pizzeria-bianco-los-angeles-location-news&s=8d12a02045f4f2ec0093882a5036172531f660829d8f1a07b58626b3126d5628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">la.eater.com/2017/8/25/1...</a>).",

    "text": "Oh my! If you go one place in Phoenix, go here! Since my visit this summer I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to recreate the magic that is Pizzeria Bianco's pies (I'm a native New Yorker - a pizza is a pie). And the owner just topped it all of for me. If it wasn't for his hospitality, the 10 ladies and I that showed up right before close would never have been able to experience this gem. We had realized we were late so we asked to order some pies to go and then the owner invited us in and sat us around the cute bar and we shared almost every pie on the menu with some nice quality red wine to go with it. My absolute favorite is the pistachio. Might sound odd but it blew my mind. I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "You know how some places are popular because it's been a local favorite forever? Well that's what Pizzeria Bianco feels like to me. All the hype surrounding Bianco made me really excited to go there for lunch, and I was sort of disappointed.  Okay, don't get me wrong. The food was GOOD. It wasn't just alright, it was good. But was it as amazing as the hype? Definitely not. I'd probably have enjoyed it just as much as I enjoy every other pizza place that claims to be the best.   And maybe they're use to getting rushed at certain time, but I went 2pm and it was dead. Why does this matter? Because my entire dining experience was less than twenty minutes long and I felt rushed the entire time. Here's how it went down:  1. We were sat down, brought water. I had literally just picked up the menu, maybe had about a minute to point out three different items to boyfriend when the guy came back and asked if we were ready. Like we've been here for less than five minutes, can you give a second? 2. We ordered and we specifically said \"that is all we want FOR NOW\", as in hm, maybe we might want dessert or something after. 3. Pizza came out ridiculously fast and we chowed down. 4. WE HAD LITERALLY JUST GRABBED THE LAST SLICES FROM THE PLATE AND THE PIZZA PLATTER WAS BEING WHISKED AWAY. 5. I was still chewing on my last few bite when we were given the check. UHM??? Okay I guess we didn't want anything else then. And like we were still hungry but I guess that doesn't matter because they obviously wanted us out of there faster than we did.   So result: Bad customer connections, too hyped, and not sure I'd go back when there are other pizza places in Phoenix begging to be explored.",

The drink options are pretty mediocre, and the ginger ale is honestly pretty gross. The sausage they use is really good, but with so relatively few options for toppings I would much rather make one myself from scratch. A really pretty area, but from what I could tell all paid parking. If you're looking for a reasonably simple menu with quality ingredients at around $20 for a personal sized pizza, then you'll probably love it.",

Try not to fill up on the delicious bread and olive oil they bring out because this pizza was better than pizza I ate at that UNESCO heritage pizza place in Naples, Italy. Seriously. The thin crust is just right, the thin sauce isn't too thin or runny, and the toppings are all local or made in-house. I went on a Sunday afternoon with no reservation and my party of 3 only waited 10 minutes. They told us to expect a 30 minute wait and sent us to the bar next door, but they're probably just trying to get you to buy a $10 drink, I say skip it and sit on the benches for free. Also, there's a mandatory $5 valet fee (but it's totally worth it to eat here!).",

You cannot go wrong with any of the pizzas they offer. These are large pizzas for one person so sharing might be a better way to go. 100% recommend!",

I struggle with the naked pizzas - as I like the sauce. But I know this is a thing so, do your thing. My service was great as well. Parking not convenient, but you can park in the parking structure which is a quick walk and get validated. Besides the pizza not being my total cup of tea, it was a little on the pricier side for just a quick lunch between meetings. I got the Wiseguy ($19) and a Diet Coke. $25 for lunch is harder for me to justify so I'm not sure if I would be back for a work lunch but maybe for an evening with friends to share different salads, pizzas, and some vino.",

    "text": "I'm sure this doesn't even need to be said, but my husband and I had a dining experience here that was completely unforgettable, and thus needs to be shared!   We were up in PHX for a Tuesday night concert just down the street from here. In our search for a place to eat, we noticed Pizzeria Bianco was nearby our destination. Having tried the Tucson location roughly 2 years ago (and having had a pretty bad experience), we thought we would give the original location a try. We are so glad we stopped in. For the two of us we got a table right away, near the oven so we could watch all the dough being tossed and the bustle of the two chefs. The place was busy for a Tuesday but not overly crowded. The building is simply and tastefully decorated. The servers were all extremely friendly and cheerfully prompt.   We both ordered red wine and decided to just get one pizza. We chose the Wiseguy and added wood-fired mushrooms. A week later and I still remember every flavor and morsel of that pizza. Delectable. After the pizza was finished (it didn't take too long, even though we were savoring!), we got more wine and ordered some coffees and dessert. I ordered the rice pudding and my husband ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Both were wonderful, especially with coffees at the end, but I think if I were to do it again I would go for the chocolate cake by myself.   All in all, it was the perfect amount of food so we felt very satisfied and not stuffed as we walked to the concert venue. My husband had the quote of the night when he said as we were leaving, \"If I could sit here for the next four hours and enjoy that exact same meal every hour, I would do it.\"",

I loved him - he was so excited about the menu, the ingredients, the fact that they are grown in the back yard - I could listen to his enthusiasm all night.   The pizza was amazing - it's not really pizza....it's doughy delish goodness - a heavenly substance and well worth the 1.5 hour wait.....once. Not sure I'd go back over and over, but glad I tried it once.  The anti pasta plate was really the highlight. All different types of grilled vegies prepared in different ways.

I thought there might be heirloom tomatoes on top but none of that.  We agree that the prices are a bit high.  The street parking is difficult but there is underground parking available.

    "text": "This business unfortunately suffers from the curse of over-hyping.  I'm a Phoenix resident, and I too had heard the buzz about Pizzeria Bianco.  I regularly dine in the area, and I'm familiar with what the Valley has to offer for pizza fare.  First of all, my date and I arrived early so we didn't have to wait --  we lucked out and got a table right away.  Unfortunately, the waiter asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink.  We asked to look at the wine list. About 30 seconds later, another waiter asked what we wanted to drink before we decided. Still again, 30 seconds later the original waiter came back and asked if we had decided what to eat now.  We ordered the wine at that point.  We settled on the Margherita Pizza and the Wiseguy.  We wanted to get mushrooms on the side, but apparently they are only available on a pizza.  We opted not to put them on a pizza so we could taste each one as they were intended to be eaten.  The Margherita had too much cheese to be a classic Margherita Pizza in my opinion.  The sauce saved it, which seemed fairly suffused with basil. Still, for \"the best pizza in the country\" - I have definitely had better.  The Wiseguy was atrociously bad.  Let me pause for a minute to point out that this is 1 out of 6 of their only pizzas -- one of which is a \"marinara\" pizza, a.k.a bread with sauce.  Speaking of which, we noticed they were filling giant bins with what looked like delicious baguettes, but they are apparently for their other Bianco business because they were not on the menu and were not offered to guests.  Back to the Wiseass -- I mean  Wiseguy.  The wood smoking of the mozzarella only made it less appealing.  The pizza is a  Frisbee of cheese with a pile of greasy onions on top.  The Italian sausage was bland, and barely noticeable under all of the onion. It tasted like a bad take on a Philly cheese-steak, or like I was eating a pound of sauteed onions right out of the pan.  Sometime about halfway through our meal, I noticed a new party who had sat down next to us received their pies.  When they spied their Wiseguy, a look somewhere between grimace and forced smile crossed each of their faces.  I looked around the rest of the restaurant and realized it was filled with similarly dissatisfied patrons.  Yes my expectations were set high from the glowing reviews. But I wouldn't have recommended a visit here if I had randomly walked in off the street.  I have an open mind and enjoy almost any culinary creation, so I can definitively tell you that this menu was simply a miss-fire.  Look elsewhere.",

Why make a pizza with a darn good crust, sauce and fresh basil, then call this crap cheese \"fresh mozzarella\"?   Seriously, you were 2/3rds of the way to a 5 star pizza but your store brand shredded mozz just KILLED IT.  Another turn off...no phone orders???..rather: \"come in and (pay for valet only parking), sit at the bar and order take out\" - not to mention, $16 for a 12\" pie that is $13 on your website.   So, $16 + $3 to park +  tip + $5 bottle of beer while waiting 40 mins for my pie = almost $30 for a crappy 12\" pie....save your $$ and buy a Tombstone.",

The pizza is really good - but it is equally good at my local pizza place without the extended wait times.  I think the waits are improved since they opened for lunch, but it isn't special enough to wait for more than an hour.

Flew in from DC on a Friday afternoon, checked into my hotel, and went straight to Bianco's. Arrived around 4:45pm and the place was about half-full. I grabbed a seat at the bar & ordered one of the tap beers (a local brew) and a margherita with sausage.  The pie came out about 5 minutes later.   Overall, it was a great pizza. Delicious airy crust, nice balance of tomato & cheese. I do wish I hadn't added sausage--it was applied with a VERY heavy hand and I ended up removing a good deal of it so it wouldn't be overwhelming.  Service was also great; the bartender checked on me several times.  People at the bar were friendly, as well, and I ended up chatting with one couple as they recommended other restaurants to try during my stay.   I guess my issue was that yes, it was a good pie and good atmosphere and I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my socks off or change my life.  It was just a solid experience. I would say I've had better pizzas in DC.  So, for me, it didn't live up to the hype.",

    "text": "Its official, Biancos has \"jumped the shark\".  We used to eat at his place when he was in a strip mall on Camelback and watched his business \"grow\" to what it is now.   I jokingly say \"grow\" because he probably has less tables now than he did before.  The only difference is that he didnt have a wine bar to send his customers to wait for 2 hours.  If you've been to Biancos then you already know the game but for those who dont, here goes:  1. You won't get in unless you stand outside for about 90 minutes before they open.  (Please)  2. If you get there when they open, you'll be waiting for 2 hours. (Please)  3. To make your 2 hour wait better he has a wine bar, which miraculously accommodates all the people he cant seat, where you will probably spend over $100 in booze as you wait.  Sort of like the beverage equivalent of the slot machines in the Vegas airport.  4. When you jump through all those hurdles, you'll get some awesome food.  You'll also notice that he only has a few tables which is why the wait is so long.  I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food, resulting in limited production but is it \"all that\"?  For outside visitors with time on their hands it's probably worth it to go once and check the box.  For locals like me, go somewhere else.  For smart locals, start another, larger pizza place across the street;",

    "text": "It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.  Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.  Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is True that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.  However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.  As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.  While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

This place can be very busy, I went about an hour before close on a Wednesday or Tuesday and still had to wait 15 or so minutes for a spot at the bar. Not an issue since they take you next door to their other bar and give them a call when your place is ready.  The restaurant itself is pretty cozy and they do not have a bunch of tables which leads to a fairly intimate experience. The menu here is pretty small. I ended up getting a wise guys pizza which has sausage with fennel , onions and cheese and no sauce. I normally do not care for white pizza but this one was superb. To drink they mainly have wine and I believe 1 beer as well as coffee , etc. The dessert menu is equally small with just one item. That item is a biscotti and it is tasteeee. Check this place out for sure but I'd advise going on a less busy night.",

We sat outside and enjoyed each others company, people watching and petting the cats that roam the park.. The second time was just the wife and I. We had to wait an hour. Again we enjoyed ourselves at their bar next door with their roasted pecans (Awesome), Anti pasta, beer and wine. The first two times we sat at the bar inside the restaurant because we asked for first available seating.      The third time my wife and got a table in less than twenty minutes. The tables are close together due to the small size of the quaint building. The staff greeted us promptly and were very efficient during our meal. I have tried several of their pizza's and they have always been great. The wood oven makes each pizza special.  I will continue to come here every chance I get.

We arrived a little before 4:00 and there were 2 groups waiting already.  Within about 10 minutes 8+ more groups arrived.  After bearing the 100 + degree weather we were finally let in at 5.  My group ordered a Margherita, Sonny Boy and Wise Guy.  It was the general consensus that the Sonny Boy was the best.     While the pizza was fantastic I don't think it trumps Grimaldi's.  I would definitely come back, but having to stand in line for at least an hour means it will be awhile before that happens.  If you love pizza you should definitely check this place out, at least once, to say you've been to the so-called \"Best Pizza in America\"",

    "text": "So....I'm a wood-fired Neapolitan-style pizza freak.    Like Aaron's review states, there is no place like Antica Pizzeria Da Michele in Naples and once you've had it, you become compelled to find a place stateside that is as good (or even close?).  So when I saw that Bianco was rated #1 in America I knew it would only be a matter of time before I booked a ticket to Phoenix....  I expected to wait in line and, despite the 90+ degree weather, resolved to enjoy it as part of the process.  Once our names were on the list, we scored a seat in the wine bar next door (brilliant set-up when you have a captive audience) and enjoyed a couple of glasses of chianti while we waited.     It wasn't long before our names came up and we were in.  More wine was ordered and we started with appetizers of spiadini (grilled, prosciutto-wrapped slices of fontina on rosemary skewers).  Killer.  We tried three of the pizzas-  and they were all excellent.  Given the popularity, I thought the prices were totally reasonable.  Not sure what other negative reviewers expected.   Maybe the wait and hype builds too much expectation or maybe they'd be just as happy with a Dominos pie.    C'mon people, it's pizza- there's only so much oral pleasure you're gonna get....   Bottom line, eating at Bianco is as much about the experience and celebrating a guy who's reached the pinnacle of success doing something he loves.   Even if I can only experience that vicariously, I will do so happily.",

When questioned, there was no answer to why this was allowed.  I assume they were regulars.  It was only tolerable because we were able to sit in the next door bar and enjoy a nice bottle of wine, cheese and salumi.  I spent  $150 bucks in the bar waiting on said wine and snacks.  Good food, awful wait system.",

This was our lucky day.  We toured the Heard Museum, and finished in time for an early dinner on a weeknight where nothing much was going on downtown.  We walked in and saw empty tables, but were told there was a 30 minute wait.  Hmmm....but then, two places were open at the bar, and we jumped on it.  What a great place to enjoy Pizzeria Bianco.  The most interesting conversations took place between the 8 of us, which totally enhanced the whole experience.  The handmade mozzarella and tomato salad is totally to die for and a great way to start your dining experience.  We enjoyed the Rosa and Sonny Boy pizzas, and pretty much finished both!  Gotta say, after finishing, it definitely would have been worth the wait, but sooooo glad we didn't have to! Definitely visit during a slow time, and do take a seat at the bar....you'll meet the most interesting people while enjoying the best pizza ever!",

They only take one reservationa day. You should definitly get there 3 or more hours before it opens at 5, because it is a small place and there will be long lines. Its very nice insidand you can watch Chris, the owner , and all the other chefs preparing pizzas. Dont listen to those bad reviews, this is a great place!",

Wonderful pizza, all baked right in front of you in the brick oven.  Ok, so it was totally worth the wait....we had a group of 6 plus an infant, and we ordered 5 different pizzas.  My fav was the margherita pizza (apparently this one is the World-famous one) and it was delicious.  Thin crust, small pizzas, but very good.  Coming from a Chicago gal, I know my pizzas : )  Would definitely recommend, worth the wait!!",

We were a party of 9 (including 5 kids) and the restaurant made us feel very welcome (they do take reservations for larger parties, so make a reservation if you can).  Food was delivered quickly but we did not feel rushed.  The menu is a little limited, so we were able to try 5 out of the 7 pizzas, and they did not disappoint.  Order the roasted veggie appetizer--it's more of an antipasti and comes with salami, cheese, olives, etc.  Salads were also a hit.  There is no dessert, so if you have a sweet tooth, you'll have to go elsewhere.",

The salads are great, the pizza is great, the atmosphere is great.  I know people complain about the long lines, but you go there and know you are spending the whole evening there.  Get there at 4pm, grab a drink and wait in line.  Best Pizza you will have.  Try to not get too many toppings.  Stick with a plane Margharita or Bianco Verde.",

    "text": "This is for all your Pizzeria Bianco virgins. I am astonished with all the negative reviews this place is getting because of the \"long wait.\" So here it is, I have been coming here with my husband and friends for a couple years now and never once have we ever had a bad experience. Yes, there is a longer wait than usual, but make the best of it. You're here to have fun, enjoy lively conversations with friends, and just enjoy yourself. If you're in a hurry to get out of there, this is not the place to go. First thing first, if going on a Friday or Saturday night, show up no later than 4:30. The place doesn't open up till 5 o'clock, but you want to get in line early so the hostess can take your name. As my husband is waiting in line, I usually grab a glass of wine and get him a beer. I typically grab a table while he's waiting in line. So once the doors open the line moves fairly quickly, once she grabs your name, let her know where you'll be sitting. Usually a quarter of the people that were waiting leave anyway because they're shocked about the wait. So that bumps you up a couple of spaces. So once that happens, we usually order an app or two if we're with friends and have a great time!  Time flies when you're having fun, so make the best of it. As many times as I've been there, I don't think we've waited more than three hours. Big deal anyway, good wine, good food, good company makes it all worth it. So once you're ready the hostess comes to get you and seats you right away. The staff is always pleasant and friendly. I suggest the caprese salad, the best!! All these pizzas are delicious, Try them all! The bread is fresh and warm, the pizzas are packed with flavor in every bite, I love it. It's a wonderful experience, I suggest going there when you're not in a rush and go with a group. By the way, if you have a group of more than 6 you can make reservations, and no you don't have to do it a month in advance. Just be sure to do it a couple days before. So shame on all those who bash on this restaurant because of the wait, or the staff or even the pizza. It's not named one of the best pizzerias in the nation for nothing!",

I went into Bianco's with VERY high expectations.  Well, this guy crafts pizza better than anyone else.  Anywhere.  AND, incredibly, he asks 12 bucks for his Margherita.  TWELVE BUCKS!!  You can also pay 11-15 bucks for his other signature pies.  As my friend said, \"It's like getting brain surgery from the world's greatest surgeon for $19.99.\"  This is pizza at its apex for a pittance. Of course, when you sell a quality product like this people will line up in droves.  So, you have to wait a long time as has been noted.  BUT, I will wait even longer than 2.5 hours next time if I have to.",

When we got to the front of the line, they took our names and told us that it would be about 1 hour wait.  Crazy in my opinion but ok, let's wait.  So there were some picnic tables on the side that we chilled out on...we watched other people waiting for a table, I drank a Coke in a bottle (what is with Coke in a bottle in AZ?), and saw a bunch of cats run around and wrestle in the grass.  After 1 hour, we got seated and we ordered two pizzas: the Rosa and the Magherita.  Both were pretty good, but I thought the Rosa was better.  I also ordered side dishes of anchovies and garlic that were drenched in olive oil.  Now, dipping your pizza in those...very tasty.  I enjoyed the pizza there but not sure if I would go out on a limb and say it was worth the wait.  If you got time and in the area, it's definitely a good place to eat.  The service was on point.",

And do they know their stuff. This pizza was hands down the best/most memorable--it was incredibly unique and flavorful and the crunch of the pistachios rounded it all out. The biancoverde was also delicious, the ricotta tasted so buttery! Another standout was their bread--apparently it is baked at their sandwich joint. It was crusty, eggy and delicious with their wonderful olive oil. We had 2 pieces left and I insisted on taking it to go--later to find out they had tucked in a few extra slices for me! Score! Pizzeria Bianco definitely lives up to the hype! GO!!!!",

When we first arrived we sat at the claustrophobia inducing bar for at least 10 minutes while the bartender had a lengthy conversation with the girl sitting behind me about high school.  When she finally did get around to acknowledging me ( I had been sitting 2 feet from her and maintaining creepy stalker eye contact for way too long trying to get her attention) she was flabbergasted that I asked what kind of cider they had.  \"Uuuuuh APPLE?\" she said rolling her eyes and doing her best valley girl impression.  I guess no one ever told her they make other kinds, but they should have told her snotty little bartenders don't get tips.  Some of my group were *gasp* smokers and during the hours long stint at the bar went outside to smoke.  The bartender actually came out and told us we had to be 20 feet away from the door, ok no problem, except we were already over 20 feet from the door.  So we asked where we should stand, and she pointed to a spot 12 inches from where we were.  a foot? Come on, power trip much?  What ever happened to snobbery being earned by actually having a worthwhile product?  Now it just seems places are rude to customers to create the air of importance without having the substance to back it up.  Too tragically hip for its own good.",

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco presents itself as an authentic Italian-style pizza house, taking pride in its quality of ingredients and consistency of dishes.  Whether the establishment has succeeded for its average patron is subject to debate.  (As a general caveat, do not trust in any Phoenix-based review of this restaurant.  Phoenix is not even remotely a world class dining city, and any restaurant in the city cannot be objectively judged by any resident of the Phoenix metropolitan area.)  The national pundits have touted this as the best pizza in America, by icons like the Food Network and even Oprah Winfrey.  Whereas the food was of acceptable quality, the dining experience itself leaves a great deal of room for improvement.    Upon entering the restaurant, an air of pretension washes over the diner; the restaurant and its staff is adequately aware of the recent press surrounding Pizzeria Bianco and it is apparent in the treatment of its patrons.  I got the distinct impression that the staff was doing me a favor by seating me, instead of me doing them a favor by providing business.     Aside from the ostentatious behavior, there is typically a 2 hour wait.  This is an egregious wait (even though I was mentally prepared for such a wait).  Beyond that, parking is difficult to come by considering its smaller-than-fast-food style parking lot (and Phoenix is not an urban environment; driving is almost mandatory).  The wait times have accumulated due to the national press and, on a purely subjective judgment call, the ever increasing desire of everyone in Phoenix to be a part of something trendy.  Since the wait was so long, the anticipation of the food's delectability grew in our already whet appetites.  To hold us over, we treated ourselves to a few of the appetizers at the annexed bar next door.  Prosciutto was mediocre; the lack of creativity begins to seep in our impressions as the dish is improperly paired with poorly cooked crostini.  Next, we had a selection of 'gourmet' cheeses so entirely pedestrian that one might wonder if a Kraft representative was secretly replacing foreign cheese samples with basic flavors.  The cheeses did not present itself in a natural progressive order along the palette leaving conflicting flavors fighting over oral real estate.    After repetitious glances at my wristwatch to gauge just how much time has passed, my party was finally called to our table (a total wait time of 2.5 hours).  Despite the lack of apology for the wait, my friends and I were excited to have a seat.  We started with a local organic greens salad.  The greens were not as fresh as one would have hoped; a lingering bitter taste hovers and is not well compensated by an unevenly distributed vinaigrette dressing.  We moved on to an Insalata Caprese (though the menu left the English translations; authentic Italian indeed).  This dish was delicious.  The olive oil was of high quality, as was the tomato, basil, and mozzarella cheese.  All ingredients were fresh and very tasty.  This basic dish was the single best piece of food served to us.    Since there were several of us dining that evening, we ordered pizzas across the menu and shared family style.  The crust on each pizza was delicious; the quality of the crust can not be understated.  It handled well in strength and durability against pizzas with tomato sauce, and was stiff, and at the same time chewy, enough against pizzas that are largely cheese or meat based.  However, whereas my pizza crust was excellent, the others at the table complained that theirs was burnt; thus, the consistency the owner strives for by hand making every pizza is entirely suspect.  The other ingredients for the pizza left room for desire.  The sausage was fatty; sauce too zesty; selection of cheeses seemed out of balance with the accompanying flavors; vegetables were elementary and sometimes undercooked.    In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.  The national critics must have been treated to a much better dining experience, because mine was only memorable because of how ridiculously over hyped this restaurant is.  This is a consistently emerging theme in Phoenix, the fastest growing city in the United States.    P.S.  I was not able to adequately comment on the wine selection, but I would assume it is poor.",

The more people that don't like it, the better, as far as I'm concerned. Why? Well...  The wait is never less than 45 minutes. The best plan is to get some friends and make a reservation, which they will take for parties of 6 or more (max 10 or 12). If you must go in a smaller group, go on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, and go early. Don't even try on a Friday or Saturday unless you're willing to get in line at 4pm (yes, that's an hour before they open).",

I thought it was ridiculous that you had to pay for parking and since EVERYONE must wait for a table, they send you next door to they're wine bar. Very sneaky.

I also planned to meet up with a friend while there. I told him I wanted to try Pizzeria Blanco after reading the reviews and finding out it is rated as the number one pizza place in the US. So we get to the restaurant and it's only an hour and a half wait! Not too bad! We waited at the bar next door, which was great. Before we knew it, we were seated. My friend brought up a good point, there is only so much that can be done with pizza. So True, but still, my expectations were high. From yelp reviews and pictures, I went with the Biancoverde pizza. It was out of control good. I loved the arugula and ricotta cheese, so simple, but so much flavor. the olive oil drizzled on top was just enough to soak into the crust. My friend and I spent the entire time chatting and catching up that we missed a few moments to really savor the food. But that's ok, we had a great time! The entire experience, long wait and everything, is worth the hype.",

We had a fun time playing cards, drinking wine and being excited.  When we walked in, I was excited. The atmosphere was great, our server seemed nice, and knowledgeable, and all we had to do was sit back and wait for our pizza.  Too bad whatever it is that I ordered was inedible. My friends enjoyed it, but I thought what I ordered was so incredibly salty I couldn't eat more than one piece. Now, this is very strange for me, because I usually eat amply in the restaurant and enjoy my leftover the next day. But this -- no way. So salty and just... uck!   Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing for me, but I sampled a bit of my friends' orders and was only slightly more impressed. I am sorry to say, this place gets a thumbs down from me.",

It's always sad to see a good thing die. I don't understand the 5-star recent reviews at all, but I assume all of you were drunk at the (ingenious marketing plan) bar next door before eating. If you're a regular or come in with a large group, you might get a decent pie. Otherwise, there are numerous local pizzerias left that are still worth the effort. Just try to keep the word amongst yourselves, because Phoenix pizzerias tend to give up on quality or giving-a-damn once they achieve any sort of acclaim. You aren't New York City. You're Central Phoenix. You can't afford all of the eye-rolling unless you produce better than hit-or-miss pizzas after hours of waiting.  If it's any consolidation, though, Bianco's sandwich shop on Central is still rather great.",

We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on a blistering 113 degree Saturday night and were told we would be seated in 2-3 hours. Ok. Not great, but ok. The scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forced to check in every hour. By their time calculations we should have been seated around 8:15 p.m. Guess when we sat down to dinner, folks? 9:30 p.m. We spent that time spending $$ in their not-so-well-cooled bar with not very many seats. Nice way to get 2 tabs out of one evening, restaurant owners! Once we were seated in the actual restaurant, we also sat at a bar. We love bar seating--however, this bar has one side with leg room, the other side has no leg room. Our awesome luck continuing, I was wearing a skirt, and guess which side we were seated at? It was not a good arrangement. Their waiters didn't feel like waiters, more like expediters working the floor. After suffering through the indignity of an outrageously long wait, one of these expediters didn't approach us for another 10 minutes. Now it's 9:40-ish. Finally we get service, which was on the gruff side. I still can't sit at the bar quite right, so when a couple leaves the other side of the bar (the side that has leg room), I approach the manger to see if we can move. Perhaps a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless. We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait...and everyone does. Even though we enjoyed the pizza, we won't be going back. Tip: the bald bartender said their slowest season/slowest nights were May-September, Wednesdays and Thursdays. If you must, go once to get it out of your system. If you're a glutton for punishment, then you have found your favorite new restaurant.",

They have a restaurant next door that they own where you can drink as much wine and beer and your heart desires, no wait necessary.  We also got some delicious appetizers - cheese/nuts plate, bowl of the largest yummiest olives I've ever had, and of course we paired all of them with lots of wine.  Finally our table was ready and we decided to go all out and the four of us ordered four pizzas and two salads. Every one was delicious...except one person decided to risk it and order anchovies on top of one of them, which in my opinion ruined that pizza.  All of the cheese melts in your mouth and the salads were so fresh.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had, but I don't know that I'd ever have the patience to wait that long again.",

My favorites were the margarita and the biancoverde - the arugula on that one is so YUMMY.  The one thing I thought was kinda weird was the waitress had to check with the chef before accepting our request to add another 2 pizzas to our order (after we were halfway thru our first round of pizza - what can I say? we are pigs).

    "text": "Hey, there's no doubt about it.  Pizzeria Bianco is really, really good.  The one drawback is that you better be into waiting in a very, very, very long line outside.  And, I don't know about you, but when it's 110 degrees outside the idea of roasting it out in the AZ sun just isn't that appealing to me.  Once you're in though the food is excellent.  The adjacent wine bar is a good idea and definitely the money make for the place as the food is very reasonable.  But when you're waiting in line for an hour and half, what else is there to do but have one two or three or more drinks. :)  Parking is a nightmare at this place.  There is no parking in a two block radius.  Once again though, the food is amazing, but the wait stinks.",

My friends (super good friends, so it was worth it) were in town for the weekend from S.F. and they had read about this place.  We decided that we would get there at about 4:30 and have drinks until we were seated.  We stood in line until 5:00, when we missed the first seating, and put our name in.  Then we proceeded to have some beer at Bar Bianco, (no hard liquor), until we were called at around 7:15 or so.  The appetizers were fantastic.  The roasted vegetable dish was amazing. (it had salami, potatoes, beets, zucchini, mushrooms, etc..) and we ordered three pizzas and a bottle of wine.  The wine was great, and the pizzas were tasty.  Well worth the wait I would say... even worth doing it again.  Although, I would prefer cocktails next door instead of beer and wine. (still deserves 5 stars)",

    "text": "I'd really like to hold back a few stars because of the absolutely ridiculous, idiotic, and insane (four hour) wait, but I can't. I waited for three hours at Sally's in New Haven one time so I guess this is only a little longer. Bianco is as good as any \"Neapolitan style\" pizza I've had in the US, but that's not to say that it's better than all the others. Bianco doesn't have that perfectly even char on the crust that a lot of places seem to be able to produce, but they've got more than enough char (maybe even a little too much). I think their pizza compares most closely to A16 than the other places I've tried (Settebello, Spaccanapoli, Tutta Bella, Una, Antica etc). The crust has great - really great - flavor, has a very good rise at the edge and is perfectly soft and chewy. The cheese is also perfect: it tastes great and melts without burning or breaking down. The basil and tomatoes tasted fresh and great. So really, no complaints other than the wait. It will be nice when the Neapolitan trend puts some more places like Bianco in Phoenix so this isn't the only option. It may be really difficult to make pizza this great faster than Bianco does, but other places seem to be able to pull it off so hopefully that will happen in Phoenix at some point too.",

    "text": "Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.",

Remember, good things come to those who wait.  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.",

Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside (almost fluffy without the volume).  My husband and I got there at 4:45 (opens at 5 and seats around 50).  There was already a line and we were number 55, so we had to go next door and wait about 45 minutes for a table.  The bar next door is a charming old house and has great wine and beer.  We nibbled on some olives and had a couple of glasses of wine.  When they are ready for you, the bartender/waitress brings you your credit card and bill, which has already been run and takes you next door.  It was nice that our credit card had already been run because I didn't want to wait another minute.  We had great seats at the bar with a great view of the entire dining room and Chris making the pizzas.  We got the caprese salad and pizza margarita and the pizza with fennel sausage and carmelized onions.  Both were amazing.  Can't wait to go back.  My advice is to go early during the week and be prepared to wait.",

We waited over three hours and had a great time drinking at Bar Bianco next door.  We had no issue with the wait and I think having some time to drink and chat at the cozy bar next door was a great way to kick-off our soon to be \"mind blowing\" pizza.  We got sat at the bar top and ordered two pizzas--the margarita and the fennel & sausage.  The pizzas were good, but not great.  The crust was soggy and it just didn't hit the taste buds the right way for us.  We sat next to a couple that had flown from Canada for one night just to go to Pizzeria Bianco.  They liked it more than us, but they said their expectations were higher, too.  Definitely worth going to and worth the wait (to at least try it once), but I don't see myself going back anytime soon to get my pizza fix.  I prefer the margarita pizza at LGO.",

It was built to such a crazy-high status; I don't think it would have been possible for any restaurant to live up to that.

Staff is very courteous and attentive. It felt like just 5 to 7 minutes that it was ready, wow. Maybe it's the time I was occupied paying for my order. With that said, if you decide to make a trip here for taking to go, you could just pay for meter parking for half an hour for instance..when coming here on a lunch break. I got a Sonny Boy without olives..substituted with mushrooms ( I don't like olives). I was actually taking this to go so I can have my dinner with happy hour at Embassy Suites.

    "text": "This place has my number. There just isn't a thing I don't love about Pizzeria Bianco. It would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional Stuff Lori Likes list: \"Waiting at least two hours, fueled by a jammy red, to eat some pizza at 10:00 at night\". Naturally, good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given. Once, I showed up and there was no wait. I went next door first anyway. Call me crazy, but life goes by too fast. I like the wait.   After an hour or two and some vino, the antipasto is a must for starters. Local seasonal veggies wood-roasted and drenched in olive oil, cured meat, olives, and some cheese; it doesn't get much better- except when gorgeous heirloom beets are on the platter. Nothing beats 'em (don't groan, it's impolite).   The Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness, one and all. My personal faves are the Rosa (pungent aged cheese, grilled red onions, and pistachios), the Margherita with prosciutto, and the Wiseguy (smoked mozzarella, grilled onions and sliced fennel sausage). And yes, I named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites.   Housed in an historic building, the atmosphere is rustic and homey. A little candlelight and an open kitchen make me feel like I'm at a friend's home for dinner - and in some ways I am. My first trip to Bianco was 13 years ago when my now husband took me for my 21st birthday; we've been going ever since.   Maybe that's why the wait never bothers me. With consistently attentive, first-name service and so many familiar faces, it feels less like dinner out and more like an evening among friends.",

    "text": "Being a New Yorker for most of my life, I'd have to say that the pizza here is different, but ranks up there with some New York pizzas. I'd say the difference here is that the crust is thinner, but cooked to more of a crisp.  Tips: -Get there early and put your name in, as you will likely be in for a long wait. You can call them to see where you are in the waiting list and get an estimated time. -They have a bar next door you can chill at where they will come get you when it is your turn to eat. -Try the marinara or margherita without toppings if you are looking for a pure pizza experience. I tried four pizzas, but my favorite was the marinara without any toppings.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Pizzeria Bianco last weekend, and it was pretty much what I was expecting: lots of hype over pizza that is fairly good, but definitely not the best pizza in the country.   Typical to everyone else's story, I arrived at 4:30 knowing I would have a wait. The rest of my party arrived a little later after I put my name on the list. There were about 60 people in line in front of me. For a table (they also have counter seating) the wait was going to be 2 to 2.5 hours. Our group went across the way to one of my favorite places Nobuo at Teeter House and had some drinks and some \"appetizers.\"  About 2 hours later we headed back to Pizzeria Bianco and found out our name had already been called. The hostess was very nice and got us in to table within 10 minutes.  The place is definitely small and cozy. We ordered an Antipasto and also the mozzarella and Tomato. Both were very good. I ordered a Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives). The pizza is very thin and light and is very fresh tasting. Our table also ordered a Marinara Pizza, Rosa Pizza, and a Wiseguy. The Rosa was very interesting since it had pistachios on it and the Wiseguy was good, but it could use some sauce. Overall, like I said before, good pizza, but definitely not the best in the country.  They don't take reservations (anymore) and they don't do takeout (although I did order a pizza to go) and with there always being a huge wait, I think he's got a good business going where you eat and drink while waiting at his other place next store (Bar Bianco).  I would have given Pizzeria Bianco 3.5 stars because it's better than A-OK, but I definitely wouldn't call myself a fan. While I enjoyed the food, I've been there now and done that and probably don't really need to go back any time soon.",

Is this place worth the three hour wait that you have to endure...well, not really.  Its good, heck, I'll even say its pretty good.  But it's not really that great.    If you find yourself with a few hours to kill and want to go to one of those \"must try for the sake of trying\" places, then go, stand in line, and order the Bianco Verde (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula) and Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage).

    "text": "I was in town for the Phoenix Comic Con and this was nearby and highly rated so I thought I'd give it a try.  For the most part, I was not disappointed.  I had a Sprite and the Sonny Boy.  The Sprite is the Mexican kind in the bottle made with real sugar and was a pleasant surprise.  Watching the bartender fill up the glass for it by sticking said glass into the ice bin was not.  Thankfully, all the rest of the staff used the scoop to fill up the glasses, and the Sprite came chilled, so I just skipped the glass with ice.  The Sonny Boy was very, very good. I highly recommend it.  They were not stingy with the Sopressato, which was nice to see.  The staff were all very friendly and responsive, props to them.  All in all though, I have Settebello in Vegas, which is almost exactly what Pizzeria Bianco is, just with a larger menu and at a lower cost.  I do not at all regret going into Pizzeria Bianco, but to be honest I would not do so again.  My individual pizza and soda cost $27 after standard tip.  That is insane.  The exact same thing at the other equivalent places in other towns would only set me back  $17.  I could have two meals, one with a beer, somewhere else for that kind of money and probably still be happy.  If/When I go back to Phoenix, I would eat somewhere else, but if someone asked me if the food was good, I would say absolutely.",

The weather was lovely and we got a bottle of wine to enjoy outside while we waited (two hours!) for our table. Okay, it was a long wait and we got 2 bottles.  By the time our table was ready, we were loaded and starving-Of course it was delicious! The crust was bubbly and crispy, and just slightly charred. The cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. Then the obvious comparisons to Cibo came in. The quality of pizza was ever-so-slightly better, but when you take into consideration the wait, the limited menu, and cramped dining room, it falls short of its competition up on Fillmore. I'm glad I went and tried the best rated pizza in Phoenix, but will I go back? Probably not. After all, nothing can live up to that hype.",

Like most everyone we went to the Wine/Beer bar next door. They have a good selection of wine and beer. We had a good time, had some apps and a few drinks and the time flew by.   Once we were called for our table - we skipped apps and just went straight to the pizza - we ordered the Margarita w/ Fennel sausage, Sonny Boy and the Wise Guy. I enjoyed all 3- but the Margarita w/ the fennel was probably my favorite if I had to chose one.   Now I do want to share something I over heard.....They are looking to extend the hours and to be open for 11a to 11p. From what I heard they are looking to try and make that change in the up coming months. If that happens I think that 2-3hr wait will defiantly drop.",

The first trip was YEARS ago and I remember waiting nearly 2 hours for a table and being half-tanked from drinking wine in the bar next door.  On this trip, I am happy to report my date and I walked in and were promptly seated at the bar (we opted for this vs a 45min wait for a table.)  We started with the Spiedini, skewered pcs of  italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto and served warm over arugula... Those were so tasty! Come on... it's delicious, smoky pig wrapped around lovely, velvety cheese! Then my date and I each ordered pizza (we could have easily shared, but opted for leftovers!)  I had the margherita and added the gaeta olives. Those olives were like little orgasms on my taste buds! They were a great compliment to the simplicity of the margherita and paired well with the chianti I chose as a beverage.  I wouldn't say it doesn't get any better than Pizzeria Bianco, but they certainly do what they do well. The ambiance of the restaurant and neighboring bar is warm and welcoming. The servers are expedient and attentive. The prices are fair and you can find something for everyone on the menu!",

We just discovered this place and planned on patronizing it at least once a week. But after the snobby response we got about \"they never, for any reason, will ever, do takeout\" we will never, for any reason, at any time, will ever patronize this place or their other location as they had the same rude response. So, if you are disabled, or in from out of town; i would suggest nobody buy their pizza. Any place that rudely rips into the caller who is \" god forbid\" inquiring if a pizzeria would be willing to do a take out order has the misconception that their customer service will be overlooked because they make a good pizza.

Given flight options for a return trip from an Ironman competition in Cabo San Lucas, I chose a five hour layover in Phoenix to be able to knock this one off of the list.  I opted to sit at the bar and was treated to a hypnotic view of the innards of their famous wood fire oven. As a first timer, I thought it was only fitting to go for the classic margherita pizza. The crust is probably the most perfectly crisp that I've ever had in a neapolitan, and the basil was perfectly sweet (as proper basil should be). Did I finish an entire pizza in one sitting? You bet.  So, is it the best pizza in the country? Having been to both Pizzeria Beddia in Philadelphia and now here, I can still honestly say that Pizzeria Beddia ruined pizza for me, and that Bianco is second to it for my palate (although they're two very different styles of pizza). I've yet to go to Tony's in SF or Difara's in NYC, but I'll be going to the former next month and the latter hopefully next year. Until then, Beddia still reigns king in my book.",

As always, the service was impeccable, friendly and prompt. We ordered the marinara (no cheese) and a local organic greens salad - which is enough for two people to share. The bread and olive oil that come with the salad are worth the trip alone. Often people ask how we can enjoy a pizza without cheese (even vegan cheese) but the tomato sauce and pizza crust at Bianco are so perfect that we don't miss it. The sauce is slightly sweet, but so fresh tasting. The crust is perfectly light and thin. Pizzeria Bianco is a Phoenix treasure!",

We also had the market salad that was so dry, we had to ask for additional dressing. For our main course, we did a 1/2 and 1/2 of Margherita and Rosa. While I love wood fired pizzas, this goes down as the worse. Not only was the pizza too thin, but the Margherita was very bland with very little cheese and the Rosa was missing the red onions and rosemary. We were so hungry that we didn't bother to complain, but I do know that I will not be coming back. Even though our experience was just ok, the staff was really nice.",

Ya ok, let me just turn around drive around downtown during rush hour to find a parking garage I've never been to. I don't care and mind about paying for valet but it would be nice if they have this somewhere on their site so customers know.   I decide to valet and ask for a manager. Dave the manager was very unprofessional and gave to shits about what I had to say. He said I didn't have to park here if I didn't want to; well considering it's downtown and parking sucks I was left with no option, he mentioned he tell customers when they call that there's a $5 valet well, if they would pick up the phone I would of been aware and prepared now I have my party of friends meeting me here and everyone will be forced to valet since they won't know any better but this is bad business practice",

I understand its a small restaurant and seating is tight- it was more the way the message was delivered. She immediately seated the party behind us ( no wheelchair or children) We were shocked that such surliness in a hostess is not a problem for this business but Ill never know if the pizza is any good as I will never spend a dime here.

On one day we weren't seated due to having 1 person from our party running late. Even though I mentioned to the host that I could order for my late friend she refused. On another occasion we were refused outside seating for no apparent reason. And lastly, I called in for a takeout order and was told that they don't do phone orders. Honestly, all these offenses are minor but the delivery of the news was always horrible. The hostesses NEVER smiled and were always very short and overall unpleasant. This is a plain pizzeria..I don't understand the whole stuck up attitude. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. Oh and forgot to mention, every single time I go, it is usually on a lunch break from school. My friends and I are wearing backpacks so I am unsure if being students had any correlation to the service we received. News flash, we aren't some hooligans from the streeets, we are currently obtaining a degreee to become healthcare practitioners! But nevermind who we are, we deserve respect like everyone else!

    "text": "I have had pizza all over the West Coast and Pizzeria Bianco is absolutely, without a doubt one of the best.  The service was quick and attentive and left nothing to be desired.  The staff at Pizzeria Bianco operate like a well-oiled machine.  Due to the pricing - which is a few dollars more than what you would normally expect - we decided on the Margherita pizza and I selected a Peroni to wash it down.  Within a few minutes our pizza was delivered and we dug in.  Halfway into our meal, Chris Bianco wandered in through the back and I instantly became star-struck.    I tried to snap a quick picture of him, but he caught me and instead of embarrassing me any further simply engaged us in a short, delightful conversation.  I informed him that this was our first time visiting and after explaining to him where we were from (Olympia/Seattle, Washington) he proceeded to compliment the Pacific Northwest.  Since I am a fan of Chris Bianco, this made a huge impression on me.  I always try to aspire to greatness and am particularly attracted to people who are culinary rock stars.  Some can be arrogant, snobby, and disinterested, but Chris was none of these things.  The guy was completely laid-back, down-to-Earth, relaxed, friendly, humble, and had such a pleasant personality that put us at ease.  All of the qualities you would expect in an excellent entrepreneur and host.  Our pizza was also a pleasant surprise and actually exceeded my expectations.  Thin crust pizzas are difficult to cook evenly and are often burnt or too soft.  This margherita pizza was perfect.  It wasn't too soft or overcooked.  I have also noticed that some restaurants have a difficult time balancing various flavors and that many serve pizzas that overpower you with saltiness.  Somehow Pizzeria Bianco is able to balance the ingredients perfectly.  They blend the saltiness of the sauce with the mild rich and savoriness of the cheese and dough so that it pairs excellently.    The difference between their competitors is night and day due to the quality of their ingredients and professional expertise.   Pizzeria Bianco is hands-down the best pizza restaurant in Arizona and quite possibly the entire West Coast.  Despite limited seating, I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for all types of pizza lovers.  Just try to arrive early (around 4:00 PM) if you don't want to wait for a table.",

One of the things I loved most is that the staff was really on top of things.  You didn't have to wait around for your server.  Everyone was working together in unison and I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.  Great way to do things.  We ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious.

We came a few minutes before 5 pm on a Thursday night and were seated right away. They were still seating right away when we left 45 minutes later. Love the chill vibe of the restaurant. Nice and laid back.   Service was fast and good. We both had the margherita pizza. It is very delicious. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's pretty close. Very fresh, simple ingredients. It was about $50, including tip, for two pizzas and two Mexican cokes. I wouldn't spend that much on pizza very often, but it's fun for a treat every now and then. I also don't think I would wait hours for this pizza, but if you come at the right time, no need to wait. It's all about planning if you want a good experience here. Does it live up to the hype? Can any place live up to this much hype? I doubt it. Just come for an exceptional pizza sometime when you feel like splurging.   I'd maybe give it 4 1/2 stars, but not 5 because the price is a little high and it's a bit out of the way for me, but other than that, great. Parking was free with validation (despite event parking that night) because we were there less than an hour.",

When the pizzas came out, they were all burnt and not worth the price point at all.  If you're looking for a good pizza recommendation, check any of the other reviews I've made on my profile. This place is not worth the wait, price, or its own hype.",

With their being open for lunch now and adding a second location, you can actually get one of those pizzas in less than 3 hours too, which is a bonus.    The Wiseguy and the Rosa are my favorites.   The prices are a little steep but the quality is fantastic.  As a friend of mine said: \"The pizza here is awesome if you wait less than 30 minutes for a table.  If you wait for an hour, it's really good.  If you wait two hours, it's ok. If you wait 3 hours for a table it's just pizza.\"",

I have to say the complimentary olive oil and bread was almost as good as the pizza. I had to stop myself from drinking the whole container of olive oil.

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco - 3.5 STARS  As one of Phoenix's popular restaurants, I had to check out Pizzeria Bianco and see what the fuss was all about!  Known for their thin crust pizza and long hour waiting period to dine here (minus a star), I came one Friday evening with the parentals. Parking was very limited. You either valet or head across the street by an underground garage parking (which can be validated 1 hour off from Pizzeria Bianco). We ended up paying $7 after validation from our 3 hour stay within the vicinity.  As I walked in, the hostess greeted me and took my name and party #. She mentioned the wait would probably be about 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. After expecting a 2 hour wait time, she recommended to head next door in their waiting lobby which also has a bar and offers small snacks. We had a bottle of wine and insalata dish.  After waiting for a little over an hour, we were summoned by our waitress at their waiting lobby area. We were able to transfer our food and drinks next door.   The venue is very cozy, dim lit and rustic. About 35-40% of the room is taken up by their kitchen/bar, while the rest of the area is full of tables for diners. Since it's a small area, it can also be quite loud and difficult to hear a conversation.  We were kindly greeted by our waiter, who was able to answer all of our questions and recommended items on the menu that was quite popular amongst the diners and himself. For service, we were well taken care of! (**4 STARS**)  PIZZA (1) Wiseguy - white sauce + wood-roasted onions + smoked mozzarella + fennel sausage ($16, **4 STARS**) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=jrKhKKY7kA4-XGVZlebRSw#jrKhKKY7kA4-XGVZlebRSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz...</a>  (2) Margherita - tomato sauce + mozzarella + basil ($13, **3 STARS**) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=jrKhKKY7kA4-XGVZlebRSw#SCMwOnc_HI5y8j35kMutGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pizz...</a>  OVERALL THOUGHTS I think Pizzeria Bianco is a decent place for some thin crust pizza, but it was NOT worth waiting that long. You pretty much waited 2 hours, but once seated, your pizza comes in like 5 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad at all, nor was the best I've ever had. Consider it satisfying if you were to dine here, but was not memorable. I do love the fact that it is home made and the products used to generate their pizza pies are of substantial quality and of local products, but I have had better pizza in Portland and San Diego who play the same game.  Is it worth visiting if you're in the area? Yes, if you want to say you've been here. Is it the best pizza you'll have? No  I hope that helps you out if you choose to dine here.

In their own words: \"Cozy, brick-walled restaurant serving wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas & Italian small plates\" Yeah the pizza is superb...and you wouldn't think of it especially in Phoenix. But it's awesome. Their bread which you can dip in oil was even better. No lie again.   But is the #1 in the US. In my opinion, no. It's definitely top 5 but NJ/NY/CT have the best pizza anywhere.  It's a small place that also has outside seating and it's waitress service. No slices here and their toppings vary from proscuitto to mushrooms.  Their pizza was near melt in your mouth. Heaven I tell you and it makes you remember how pizza should be.  We had:  *The bread which they bring out. I am still dreaming about it. Could be the best we had in ages.  *Local Organic Greens with Red Wine Vinaigrette - pass on it. It was just greens...and the same one.  *Green Olives - they come with the bread as well...tasty.  *Margherita - We added olives and Wood Roasted Mushrooms. So fing good! A small pie is enough to feed 2.  *Local beer on tap (they had just 1) and it tasted like bud...so not a good choice.  Otherwise this place is worth a stop for the tourist feeling.  Get their early or be prepared to wait. Seriously you can wait hours. We lucked out and were in/out in 30 minutes.",

We had two pizzas between the two of us (hey, we wanted to try it out!), both \"white\" pizzas.  One was arugala with some other veggies and the other had sausage and carmelized onions.  OMG it was delicious.  And it doesn't hurt that there's a wine bar next door, in case you have to wait for a table at the pizza place :-).",

    "text": "The pizza combinations don't get better than Pizzeria Bianco! Of course there's a wait, but here's the way you do it. First, go with a group, 4-6 people. It makes the entire experience better and you can try all of the different pizzas. Next, make sure someone in your group gets there at 4:30 to wait in line and put your name on the list - Being in the first wave of people is great, but I prefer to be in the second wave who gets to go in. Being in the second wave, with a group, allows you time to hang out at the bar next door and wait for the server to come get your group. However, your group should probably buy the person who gets there early a round or two.  Once you get in, go all out, order an appetizer, order a pizza (and put more stuff on it!), and go for a dessert. The service is excellent and you won't be disappointed! Just make sure to invite me with your group!",

    "text": "PIZZERIA BIANCO, the holy grail of pizza. Oprah hit this shizz up a few years ago, chefs list it as their \"last meal to eat on this earth\" or something on their \"Best of\" list and this place just blew up.   my grandparents have lived in AZ since the 80s and visited Bianco, pre-Oprah, and didn't have to wait for 2+ hours to get a slice from Chris Bianco's oven. I went last December post Suns game, hoping that since we got there around 9, the wait would be shorter. yea, I was wrong, but the wait was worth it and i liked the \"waiting arrangements\" next door at a little victorian house that felt like someone's house with a full bar in it, complete with board games and mags. my boyfriend and i waited for 2 hours or so (note: they do not take your name after 10pm to wait for a table and they do not take reservations, obvs), until our name was called and we sat down in the smallest little dining room ever - basically you are on top of the oven where the golden pizza comes out of it, but i was ok with that. the ambiance was very \"italian grandma's kitchen\" and i loved it.   we ordered 3 pizzas for the 2 of us. i mean, we're not crazy, we didn't know the last time we would be back here and willing to wait or lure other people with us you would be willing to wait - so naturally we needed to bring home some leftovers (b/c Bianco does not do carry out or delivery). we got the white pizza (my fav especially because i would rather have my pizza without sauce, very italian and very cheese+bread you might say, but i don't care, sauce ruins the pizza most times), margarita pizza and some other pizza that my boyfriend ordered prosciutto on top of it (we can call that one the mainly meat one). they we are AMAZE...amaze. i brought the pizza home to my dad and showed him the goods we scored; he was proud of me (i mean this is the most coveted pizza in the US people, the big O put the gold coating on it), he proceeded to eat the pizza in the morning for breakfast, warmed up in the oven of course. it was AMAZE then too, i took a few bites (it was hard to eat more pizza after i consumed so much while at Bianco)  the hype is for real. the pizza is the shizz. this is it, your pizza holy grail. get on the next flight to AZ or get your ride on the 101.",

I waited in 114 degree heat for 2 hours to get into this place, along with about 30 other people... and I don't think any of us left unhappy.  They won the James Beard Award for Culinary Excellence... If you don't think this place is good you are in the vast minority.  This place is synonymous with excellent pizza.  I recently read a post on another travel blog from someone that had been here and described his experience... 5 people in his party went, each ordering a different pizza.  After trying each one, they then ranked each pizza in order of least to most liked... In the end they all differed in opinion on their favorite, but every single person agreed that their least favorite pizza of the group was still far better than any other pizza they had ever had.  That pretty much sums it up.",

    "text": "For my birthday, the wife planned a trip to try the best pizza in america. We flew in from San Diego on Fri afternoon, immediately went to Pizzeria Bianco at 330pm and was the 3rd group in line. Weather was about 110 degrees, so we acknowledged each other by eye contact, but limited talking or movements. The staff at the bar (opens at 4) was very friendly, provided water and drinks. By the time 5 rolled around, the line was past the bar area. Summary of eats: -Antipasto which consisted of wood roasted vegetables (red peppers, mushrooms, fennel, cauliflower, and beets), cheese and Sopressata. -Rosa Pizza (Red Onion, Parmigiana Reggiano, Rosemary, Pistachios) -WiseGuy Pizza (Carmelized Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage)  Conclusion: The antipasto was a pleasant surprise, with the mushroom and fennel being the highlight. We were not a fan of the pizzas. The Rosa pizza was too strong in parmigiana and overpowered the entire pizza. Unless you're a avid fan of parmigiana, I wouldn't order again. The WiseGuy pizza was ok, nothing extraordinary. The fennel sausage had good balance flavor. The pizza dough was good balance and nice char.   Considering the efforts and reputation, we were definitely expecting alot more. Many warned me that the pizza would not live to the expectation and sadly they are correct. However, we have visited other restaurants with just as much hype and they have delivered above our expectations. Thank goodness Mozza is within driving distance.",

    "text": "Went 11/28/08 (a Friday)  We had a party of eight people and went to line up at 3:25pm.  People were not exactly lined up there but just sitting around talking.  There was no organization at all..just by memory and the honor system.  I thought it might cause problems but I went with the flow.  That was a big mistake.  For some reason, there was a couple who many parties accepted to cut in front even though we got there before them (which the couple admitted to).  So we stepped in front of them in line and acknowledged that other people were in front of us as well but we were definitely in front of those guys.  What followed was a heated disagreement and bad tensions that put a big damper on the evening.    I can't believe that it was like this but my brother (who has been there 3 times) said it's like this every time.  I suggest if you go then either have someone start a list or talk with everyone to know the order right when you get there to avoid possible problems.  Anyways, the rush to line up is really to get in the first seating, otherwise you will have to wait another couple of hours depending on your party size.  After they open and they get your party on their list, you can go next door to the pub and relax there and they even call you when you are up which is a big plus.  After getting in, our party sat at the bar and could see Chris at work in his mastery.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good.  We each ordered a pizza so we could try all varieties.  My favorites were the Margherita and Wiseguy but my brother loves the Biancoverde.  The pizza was great like I heard and expected.  Worth the wait?  Yes, because I needed to test the hype and continue my quest on finding the best pizza places out there.  Best in America?  No..I can name a couple in Brooklyn that I prefer but it's top 10 taste wise for me (so far).",

Because of great reviews and I've seen it once featured in \"The best thing I ever ate\" on FoodNetwork, we decided to make a final stop with excitement before heading back to LA.  We ordered the Margherita and Wiseguy. The tomato sauce on the Margherita appeared little and dry, and the wiseguy was pretty much just piled with a ton of mozzarella cheese with few pieces of fennel sausages and onions here and there. I've had many gourmet pizzas, and fine, I understand a chef's passion when it comes to food and however it's made is supposedly the best for the customers. But WHAT IF, I'm saying \"WHAT IF\" whoever was making the pizza that day happened to put so little tomato sauce, which caused the pizza to be so dry and not enjoyable? Instead of sending back the entire pizza and having them remake one, we asked for a side tomato sauce and boy, we were rejected and given a speech of whatever the owner/chef said, blah blah blah. Never once asked us how the pizza was before turning down our request.  How snobby to think your pizza is the one of the best and refuse to give a customer the best experience he/she can possibly have. For that, you get 2 stars.",

All have been excellent, but wasn't such a fan of the Wiseguy.  Too much onion for me, but the fennel sausage is great.  The Biancoverde and the margherita with fennel sausage are my favorites.  Next time I'll be trying the Rosa for sure.  Some tips:  So of course you hear about the crazy long waits.  Make the most of your time if you have a three hour wait.  Go check out the Science Center's Body Worlds while you wait.  I think it's about $20 to get in, but it really is cool and kills a couple hours.  Then make your way back to Bar Bianco.  Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers (cheese dish is good, but small).  By the time you finish the bottle it's time to eat.  Also, I highly recommend going in the fall or spring on a really nice night so you can sit outside with your wine.  Enjoy!",

(not really bad)  THE LOWDOWN: In recent years, I have had some pretty good pizza, but.....this sets a new standard.  I believe that the crust makes the pizza, well this is by far the best crust I have had.  Serious Pie has good crust, but this one is better - hands down.  The toppings come next and man they were fresh and delicious.  Everything was spot on.  A must when you are in the area.  They have an awesome old house right next door that you wait for your table at.     Just go!",

    "text": "The suspense and build up by food media was no joking matter as I can finally attest to one of the most acclaimed pizza joints on American soil!  As the great Bobby Flay had once announced to a crowd of Phoenicians that Bianco's pie can very well stack up against some of the best in New York, if not the best in the nation.  Regardless of who said what , I truly enjoyed what I consider a GOOD pizza! Wait, I meant a PHENOMENAL pizza! The one trait that I dearly focus on is the CRUST!  I love a crunchy, thin, light airy dough!  It even had a delicious taste to it, which I thought took it to another level!   The sauce did not overtake the dough as it was light tasting and just enough to cover all areas of the pie.  The cheese had the right amount of cheesiness!  Overall, it was very well balance!  The portion was just right.  Just about any grown adult could finish this in one sitting!  When it comes to pizza, I typically order something really simple.  What I just described was their Margherita, simply cheese and sauce!  With that said, I could not be more pleased and satisfied!    I came here on a Friday lunch hour and there was no line, although it was still busy!  No hype! Bianco is worth the trek no matter what part of the country you are from!",

In a beautiful location in downtown on the edge of heritage square. Plenty of outdoor seating while you wait. Kinda tight and small inside, which was only noticeable to me now that I have a baby. They had a high chair though which was awesome! And without even asking they brought us a plastic lid/cup/straw for the little one. Everyone was very nice and attentive (the whole restaurant service team seems to work together to provide service instead of getting assigned tables). My sister has a dairy sensitivity and so she got the marinara pizza (no cheese) but had chunks of basil and sliced garlic and said it was fresh and delicious. I got the wise guy, smoked mozzarella (omg, so good) with onions and fennel sausage. The cheese was so melty, and the crust was perfection. And you don't feel overstuffed when you leave. Excellent!",

    "text": "I've been here at least a dozen times over the years (wow, the first time was nearly 10 years ago) and have always put off reviewing it, anywhere. But here's the skinny:  * You will have to wait. Expect to wait. Expect the wait-time to be longer than you were told. Be patient. Hey, there's been a bar next door for a little while now. Go have a few drinks. Food tastes better anyway with the aid of the Booze Goddess coursing through your veins. Trust me, they'll find you.  * Do not be put off by the perceived rudeness of the staff. They're overworked and get lots of impatient, pushy idiots everyday (not you, of course. Other idiots). Also, it's more \"authentic\" that way. If you don't like it, don't go to Italy. Basta.  * The food's good. Only twice out of the dozen+ pizzas I've tried here was one burnt to the point of \"inedibility\". Bianco knows what he's doing. Let him do what he does. He uses the freshest ingredients and that's why you've waited hours to eat his food (i.e., it's worth it).  So, yeah. Get over it and eat. I've seen very little deterioration in the quality of the product over the years. And with the recent surge in diners over the last year or so since the Oprah bandwagon of minivans came over, that says a lot. This isn't one of those places where \"the hype\" needs to be taken into account.",

YES, the wait is horrendous.  I honestly think that's part of the charm though; the anticipation makes the pizza a little bit better.  It's a competitive field.  Would Ken's Artisan Pizza taste as good if you had to wait two hours for a pie?  Maybe.  Go here if you're prepared to wait a looooooong time for a pizza that is without peer.  If you're visiting from out of town, it's an experience you will not forget.",

(but i am no fine cheese connoisseur)...beer was great  8pm...did nothing...still hungry...played games 8 games of solitare and bubble breaker on cell phone  9pm...sat and placed an order for 4 different pizzas  9:45pm...took the first bite and thought there is nothing special about it...took a second bit and said the freshness of the ingredients was grand.  The quality of ingredients were really good.  The crust burnt, the dough tasted nothing more than naan at an indian restaurant cooked in a clay oven.  Sauce fresh tasting...cheese far better than the shit next door.  10pm...got bored of the pizzas decided to try others...sadly same effect.  all in all this place is okay, is it worth 3 hours...NO.  is it better than little ceasar's YES...  personally BJ's Pizza and Brewery, Nello's, Oregano's, Grimaldi's, and especially Spinato's is far better, and you have less of a wait at any of these places...  why the long wait then?  cause the place is tiny, maybe 25 seats, and an hour and a half to two hours dining time...plus media hype  why the good reviews?  cause after 4 hours of hunger and or boozing even taco bell's mexican pizza would be the best thing you ever tasted that night.  Needless to say Jack Bauer does more in 4 hours...and this is 4.5 hours I will never get back.",

Yup the smugness on the diners' faces while you hungrily eyeball their pies from the front window is unbearable.  But when you take a bite of the Biancoverde - its fresh mozzarella complimenting the peppery arugula - the wait, heat, and envy disappear into a cloud of happy taste buds.  It helps that the staff seem genuinely happy to have you there. That they're proud to share their delicious food with you. That they'll provide recommendations and offer solutions to your dining needs such as offering you a half-and-half pie because you stupidly stuffed your face at the D-backs game a few hours ago and can't manage to order 2 pies.  So when you're enjoying your slice of pizza and that hungry patron waiting outside catches your eye, tone down the smugness okay? No one likes a show off.",

It was 8 of us and we waited for 3-4 hours at their conveniently located bar next door.   Once we got seated, there was a rush to place the orders. Since we'd heard so much about \"The best pizza in US\", we pretty much ordered everything on the menu.  Most of the pizzas were good. Nothing revolutionary, but good. Unfortunately, the last pizza we got (cheese and spinach) had burnt cheese in it. Not the kind where u burn it while cooking, but the one that was made with burnt milk. Two of us noticed it while the rest waved it off as \"It's Bianco! how can it be burnt!\"...  So, my problem with the place wasn't the overall taste of food. I think it was decent. Just the hype about it. Right after having this pizza, I went to a tiny unknown place in Maryland which served amazing pizzas!   So to people who go crazy over Bianco, I'd suggest going out and just trying random lil places.. they might actually blow ur taste buds away.. instead of the 3 hr wait..",

So I finally decided (after living in Phoenix for 2 years and some time) to go check out this crib out.    My first impression walking into this house was wow it's nice and cozy.  The hostess was very attentive and gave me a smiling greeting (that doesn't make sense but deal with it).  She said it would be a 20 min wait and I was in shock.  People were telling me that the waiting list was usually 1-2 hours, sometimes 3.  But let me tell you a little secret.  People are dumb and they go eat out on a Thurs-Sat nights.  Guess what people do on those nights?  They go eat out... SOOO to give you some advice, go eat out on a mon, tues, or wed and stop complaining about the wait time.  Well I ordered a margarita pizza and some sparkling water.  The pizza came out and I didn't go wooo lala or WOW amazing or 0_0.  It's only a pizza.  I took the first bite and it tasted like good pizza.  That's the only thing it tastes like... good pizza.  So I don't understand why people go crazy over this place.  It's only pizza..

In the meanwhile we waited at the bar, which had a poor beer/wine list and rude, inattentive, unknowledgeable servers.  When we finally got seated, the service was better. The wine list was atrocious.  We're talking about 15 selection total, and only one from southern Italy. One beer on tap.   We had a caprese salad that was only mediocre. The tomatoes were rather flavorless although the were supposedly locally-grown. Finally, the pizza was good, although not life-changing. It was probably not even the best pizza I've ever had.",

Bianco's small plates are an antipasto selection and spiedini, which consists of \"Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm.\" Salads are the house salad w/mixed greens going for $6 and the caprese carrying a hefty $9 price tag.  The dining room at Bianco is about 1/65,245 the size of a dining room at the Cheesecake Factory, making it a far more intimate space. With hall ceilings and brick walls, Pizzeria Bianco feels as rustic as it looks. Although the dining room is small, your waiter has a lot of other customers to take care of, so don't expect star treatment.   Containing the three colors in the Italian flag, the caprese is a plate of thick, watery slices of house-made mozzarella, large slices of ruby-red tomatoes, and bright leaves of basil. Olive oil and vinegar are perched in the middle of the table, so patrons can garnish their salad as they see fit. Although caprese is a summery dish, it was equally enjoyable in November.  My favorite pre-pizza dish was the spiedini. Atop mixed greens (not mentioned on the menu! yay for unexpected salad!) sit two skewers. Each skewer is poked through a chunk of fontina cheese, all of which is then wrapped up like a birthday present in prosciutto. Inside the slightly caramelized prosciutto hides softly melted cheese which oozes out upon being cut. The contrasts of temperature, texture, and flavor dance inside your mouth.  No matter which pie you order, the standout of the pizza will be the crust. Fired in a wood oven, every pizza is prepared individually by owner/chef Chris Bianco. Like the bread served at the beginning of the meal, the pizza crust is incredibly delicious. A slight crunch on the crust gives way to a chewy center. Char marks freckle the ring of crust at the circumference as well as the bottom of the pizza.  The marinara, is the plainest pizza on the menu. The sauce overpowered the crust both in flavor and in texture, making an otherwise glorious crust into something floppy and flaccid. The addition of cheese and basil, as found on the margherita, makes a world of difference. Less sauce is used on this pizza, meaning the crust stays crisp and the flavors are allowed to complement each other in better proportions.  Gutsier choices on the menu include the Rosa and the Wiseguy. The Rosa, sans tomato sauce, is topped w/red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios. Although I've put walnuts on a pizza before (curry sauce + walnuts = whoa), I'd never thought to crumble up pistachios to use as a topping. The crushed nuts provide an earthy flavor as well as a fantastic contrast in texture. The combination of toppings makes for a light yet satisfying pie.  The Wiseguy, also without red sauce, comes topped w/thick, wood-roasted rings of onion, house-smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. A hearty pie, the Wiseguy tastes mostly of the fennel-spiked sausage. It's easy to lose the smoky flavor of the cheese and the roasty flavor of the onion beneath the overpowering punch of fennel. Regardless, that sausage is really, really tasty.  During one visit, I combined the Rosa and the Wiseguy by ordering a Rosa topped w/some of the fennel sausage ($3 extra as a topping). The sausage had the same effect on the Rosa as it had on the Wiseguy, basically wiping out any other flavors I would've tasted otherwise. So, while the fennel tasted good, it was impossible to distinguish the rosemary, cheese, or pistachio. Unless you can taste beyond the sausage, you'd be wise to leave it off your pizza.  These are no desserts at Pizzeria Bianco--unless you consider pizza a dessert, which I certainly do. There is a list of a couple dozen whites and reds, though, so oenophiles will be able to enjoy their pizza w/a glass or a bottle of the good stuff.  But don't feel obligated to order a drink. Unlike those chain pizza restaurants, you don't have to get drunk first in order to enjoy the pizza.",

    "text": "When you reach the passover from double, to triple digit reviews, you want the century marker to be something notable and worthy.  Where else could commemorate a 100th review than Pizzeria Bianco?  The secret to Bianco is really quite simple:  Have kickass friends.    What I mean is, have friends who will call you mid-evening, and bless you with the great news that they have enrolled in Bianco prison, and would you kindly meet them for dinner in a few hours after the NCAA basketball games have finished and maybe after a little self-primping in front of the bedroom mirror?  Why, yes!  So, addressing the exhaustively discussed subject of wait time, having done both the hard-time and the soft-wait outside of Bianco, I have to say, \"just get over it\".  Is anything worth waiting two, three, four hours for?  Yes.  UT national championship football tickets. A reunion Smiths show at the Hammersmith Apollo.  A plane ride to Seattle.  And Bianco Pizza.  What I'm trying to illustrate is, you are there for the experience.  The wait, the wine, the conversation, rinse, repeat.  Eventually, you will get into the gorgeous early-century brick general-store-esque building and feel like you've accomplished something.  Don't be a bitch about it.  This is the highest quality slice you will likely ever have, and though some will argue the necessity for the buildup, you will never have the same dining experience anywhere else.  Moreover, any place equally hyped and ballyhoo'd, will leave your wallet hundreds of dollars lighter.  Bianco does not.  So, when the waiter came, and my gf and I finished off our delightful $9 Sangiovese (from Arizona, nonetheless -- hint: this is a RAAAAARE varietal for our state), we observed that they had Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale (from Sedona).  An absolutely PERFECT brown ale, far FAR better than Newcastle or anything Four Peaks could brew up (the secret is in the superior Sedona water).  My gf got that one, and of course out-selected me.  Instead, I had the Mirror Pond Ale from Bend, Oregon .. a superior brew that represents the promised land of micro-brew very appropriately.  Both were highly complimentary beers for our impending pizza dinner.  For our pizza selection, we chose the Rosa (the must-try for Bianco n00bs) and the margherita with prosciutto added on top.  The Rosa, as usual was outstanding, but the margherita/prosciutto was absolutely fucking phenomenal.  I couldn't get over how delicious this creation was and as a self-aggrandizing foodie, it was truly the best pizza I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Please do yourself a favor, loyal reader, and give consideration to this option upon next visit.  Overall, I could not dream of giving Bianco anything less than a solid 5 star rating.  Look, I gag and eye-roll about overhyped goods like any other would.  A band?  If they've been out longer than 5 minutes, released anything longer than an EP, or have had a showcase at SXSW, hell, they're way to overexposed for my taste.  A football team?  I hate USC for no reason.  And so on.  Bianco doesn't deserve similar criticism.  Go for the oddity and hype, but stay because you have the sense to appreciate a remarkable overall experience.",

I don't mind sitting around for 2 hours to be seated.  If the dining experience was out of this world.    Felt the Hostess stand was highly inefficient with seating that's why it takes so long.

We (my wife and I) were big fans of Mr. Bianco's pies when he was at his original location at the Town and Country and are big fan's of the present.  I like drinking wine, so waiting next door...added bonus!  Is the pie worth the wait.... unequivocally yes!  The parmigiana, pistachio and onion pizza is one of the best pizza's I have ever eaten.  The best possible ingredients make for the best pizza's and Chef Bianco is good!  Hence it's pricey, but great ingredients cost money.    I haven't been in awhile, because I just don't have the time to invest in a long wait and I have had to cut back on the wine :(.....but if you have time and you appreciate pizza as good as it gets...enjoy the wine for me!",

I was super excited to eat here. I've lived in Phoenix for 5 years now and it was the first time that I've really had the opportunity to go. I was warned ahead of time that there is usually a long wait time...but a THREE HOUR WAIT is freakin' ridiculous!  It is nice that the little bar place is next door because it takes your mind off of the wait a little bit...but three hours is just a little much. If I hadn't been there with friends who had driven from Mesa to meet up, there is no way I would have even entertained the thought of sticking around.  By the time we actually sat down to eat, I would have chowed down on a piece of cardboard with pepperoni drawn on it in red Sharpie. Yeah, they use \"good\" ingredients. Yeah, they have this fancy-schmancy wood fired oven. Yeah, yeah, yeah...it was okay. For the wait we had, I expected a lot more...the pizza was average at best.  On the other hand, the appetizers we got were off the charts amazing. Prosciutto and asparagus, roasted veggies and bread w/ good EVOO...how can you go wrong, right?  Sorry Phoenix, you're pizza gem was a big disappointment. As a pizza lover, I think it was okay...but unfortunately the wait overshadowed the food and I'll never go back.",

Wow, was it worth it. The pizza is to die for. Perfect combinations of meat, cheese, and crust, and the atmosphere is really cool as well. If you go in expecting to wait, it's totally worth it. You forget all the negatives the second you take a bite of the pizza. It really is THAT good.",

I did enjoy the pizza,  probably the best that Phoenix has to offer. It tasted like Lombardi's (in NYC) a little bit. My only gripes were the fact that you had to use valet, there were very few choices when it came to pizzas and toppings, and there is only one size, which frankly isn't enough to fill 2 adults. However, I would definitely come back if I am back in town.",

Once we were seated, the staff was amazing (except for one, but I'll not get into that).  The wait staff works as a team, so don't be surprised if you see many different faces during your dining experience.  They really seem to have the team process down to a \"T\".  Service was outstanding.  The market salad of the day was yummy.  It had goat cheese on it.  Listen, if you have the opportunity to have their goat cheese on anything, I highly recommend you do!

That's his ultimate fav and that was our ultimate fav! Too bad we didn't end with it. Maybe if we did, I'd push this up to 4* ;) (It is a must try! Flavorful and fresh ingredients. Superb!) We ended with the sonny boy and that was a big of a disappointment. Both my hubs and I didn't care for the Gaeta olives on the pizza. It was also a bit salty too. But we dont' regret trying something different. I do wish we would have just gotten the margherita alone instead of adding the fennel sausage. I wasn't a fan of the sausage. I think I would have liked it just normal.   Our last pizza, the sonny boy came out a bit burnt. Felt like that was a little unacceptable.   We didn't have a wait which was great and while we were there it didn't seem like there was a long way. Just depends on the day and hour. Not sure how often I would come back. Glad that I tried it at least once though.   I guess I was thinking of the wood fired pizza we had in Naples, Italy and still hoping for something close to that. It wasn't. And for the price, I'm not totally convinced that it matched, BUT the flavors were positive, ingredients fresh, service very good.",

I was fortunate that we were done with patients early so when i got there, there was hardly any wait.  Everyone enjoyed them, but from my other experiences I know you can wait up to 3 hours to get in.  Its got a great decor but is small, and this often means you end up waiting a while.  I do not think it is worth anything more than a half hour wait but it is good.  All the pizzas are good!",

    "text": "This is our second time here and again it was fantastic. We went there today with our family (2 adults and five kids not easy) but the service today was some of the best we have ever received. This team was so in sync with the restaurant and their guests. The host immediately greeted us and when we told her it was a party of seven with five kids she let us know our table would be available shortly as soon as she could put it together, no eye rolling that we have become accustomed to with our family. She quickly put it together and got us sat, I mean in under five minutes and the restaurant was fairly full. Before we were even sat the table was fully set including waters for our kids which made thins move so much quicker. Every need, question, want was catered to quickly and professionally and we were tended to by everyone in the front of the house at some time or another. I'm not sure if they do team service but if so they should be a training ground as this is what team service should be. Drinks were never half full dirty plates were never on the table for longer than a minute and at one point my six year old dropped her fork and within 30 seconds it was replaced without us having to ask. I hardly ever post reviews about service staff anymore because we have just become so accustomed to average/mediocre service everywhere we go but this place was the definition of amazing service through and through. I don't want to take away from the food either because both time we have gone it has been beyond amazing but today the amazing service can not just go unnoticed. We were there today 5/22 at 1230 and this team should be recognized for their amazing work and we will be back time and time again because of them, and the amazing food. Thank you again.",

    "text": "Stopped by Pizzeria Bianco on our way to Sedona from LA around 12:30 on a Saturday (Thanksgiving weekend). I was already expecting a wait time of at least 30mins. They open at 11 so I imagined everyone that was waiting just got seated and are devouring delicious pizza. Luckily tho, we were seated right away! The restaurant is pretty smallish, so if you are group of 4+, you probably have to wait long. The group before us were told of 30-45min wait and they left. We started off with the delicious speidini, which was best with arugala  otherwise it can be a tad salty with the prosciutto. We had half wise guy and half margherita. Both are really good with the crunchy crust but for us, margherita's flavor stood out more, it was almost perfect!! A little pricey but definitely worth the experience.",

We ordered the Rosa (the onion and cheese with the AZ pistachios) was such a taste sensation, even my daughter who has a pretty benign palette was in awe, a Margherita for my fussy son, who loved the sweet sauce and crispy crust from the oven and a Wiseguy for me. Now my pizza had the most amazingly sweet caramelized onions, the flavorful smoked mozzarella and a fennel sausage that was to die for! A tastebud extravaganza  that has not varied in all this time. The wait staff was great. The atmosphere was laidback and fun. Best part - my kids got to experience a Phoenix culinary institution and they loved every second of it.",

The guys making the pies noticed it was getting busier and made the decision to dim the light a tad - PERFECT! The salad was great (we got one of each), the tomato on the caprese was HUGE and the mozzarella was fresh. I love that they bring you bread and evoo.

Honestly, on our first visit, we had a three hour wait, and we were hammered by the time we were seated and we over ordered on everything so that we had lots of leftovers to remember when we were sober. Its nice that they have the town and country location now so the wait is much more reasonable and the food is still bomb. Some of the best pizza and pasta EVER.",

My wife ordered a Farmers Market salad it was $10 and literally a plate of lettuce, a few onion slices, a sprinkle of goat cheese and some flavorless croutons. Not worth $2 let alone $10. And not farmers market by even the weirdest imaginations. Instead of a bunch of beers on tap they have some nasty IPA and one other \"flavor of the month\" which was also some disgusting beer so if you like hoppy beer, you're ok, if not you're screwed, you'd be better off sticking with water or bottles of Coke.

Visited here a little after 5 on a Monday and there were two tables left inside and one outside. The patio is in the front of the restaurant (so you walk through it to get to the hostess stand). Everyone was so polite and well groomed. We sat inside because even tho the patio is covered it still was a little warm. We got the tomato and mozzarella salad and then the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms to half. The waiter even suggested splitting half and half if we wanted to try more then one kind. Everything was perfect and came out faster then expected. The crust was a little burnt to where you could taste it but that's expected. They also serve you bread and oil which is hard to stop eating. We did ask for balsamic but they never ended up bringing it. If you're downtown, give it a try. It's a little pricey but for a celebration it's so worth it! There is plenty of metered street parking so you can avoid the busy 7st valet parking!",

    "text": "You're planning a trip to Phoenix, and you discover there's a pizza place that's nationally famous and has been hyped to the hilt as \"Best pizza in America\".   That's a heady claim.   Being from Albany NY, with it's proximity to the pizza capital of the world, NY City, we have some very good pizza places. But nothing that comes close to the notoriety of Pizzeria Bianco.  Having read through some yelp reviews bemoaning the long waits, and with my wife tagging along, sitting 2-3 hours in the 100 degree heat was not an option. My plan was to go 1/2 hour before opening. Thus, I was sure to be in the first or second seating, and the wait would be tolerable (I hoped).  We headed over on a Saturday morning and arrived a little late. They open at 11, and we arrived 10:45, due to lack of parking and unfamiliarity with the area. To my surprise there was only two other brave souls waiting outside the restaurant wilting in the heat. YES!  My guess is the long waits are for dinner. So if you must have a Pizzeria Bianco pizza, (and if you love pizza you must), I'm willing to bet you'll have a short wait if you come at lunchtime, at least on the weekends.  We ordered two pizzas and wow were they good. It's without a doubt some of the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is light, oh so light, but still chewy and crunchy, (that's awesome, because you can eat a lot of slices without feeling bloated and full). Big bubbles adorn the end crust, and those burnt bubbles have a very subtle smokiness to them from the wood fire. The toppings all were of high quality too. The sauce tastes of fresh tomatoes, and it's *just* sweet enough.  Pizzeria Bianco lives up to the hype as one of the best pizzas in America. If I'm ever in Phoenix again, it will be the first stop I make.",

More outside seating when it's not 413289 degrees out. It's really cute - love the brick and open feeling to it. Bar area was really nice.  Very friendly service but they should ask if you've been there before and if not, tell you a little about the pizzas. It wasn't clear on the menu how big the pizzas were and what was on the pizzas without tomato sauce etc. One server told us the other pizzas had white sauce (which I think of as an alfredo-type sauce) on it but it was just olive oil and no tomato sauce.  Pizza was ok - a little burnt on the crust. Expensive for the size and toppings IMO. We had the Sonny Boy which was good but the olives overpowered the whole pizza. The other one we tried was the Wiseguy, which was good but no where near the best pizza I've ever had. I wish we had tried the salads - they looked delicious.",

    "text": "Chris Bianco is the OG. He is the godfather of artisanal pizzas in the United States and his pizzas have the quality to back up that statement. This is one of the best Pizza places in America and its hilarious that it is in Phoenix of all places.   In 2015 Bon Appetit magazine named Pizzeria Beddia the best pizza place in America. In an interview with Joe Beddia he states that he learned a lot from Bianco. However, one thing that rings True when you go to Pizzeria Bianco is this quote from Joe Beddia \"He said that, sure, he could teach me a few things, but it was up to me to find my own style\". Despite neopalitan pizza places popping up left and right it is those pizza places that have their own character and don't just follow the VPN standards letter by letter that can really shine. Quickly on non pizza food: I could make a meal out of the bread they serve when you walk in. I had a salad as an appetizer and it was simple and well dressed.   On to the pizza: this is artisan pizza at its best. It is made in a wood fired oven quickly as you would expect from a artisinal pizza place. However, the crust is a little sturdier than Neapolitan pizzas. It is able to hold ingredients well but at the same time if you are big into folding you could do that too. You can easily tell that Bianco takes great pride in his local ingredients and it shows in the taste. The meats were delicious and the cheese was exactly what you are looking for on this kind of pizza.  If you love pizza you have to come to Bianco!",

It's a great location if you are in downtown Phoenix at a baseball or basketball game, or visiting the Children's Museum or Science Center. We arrived around 5:00 on a Sunday (after a Diamondbacks game) and had a 20-30 min wait. When we were seated, I asked about kid sized pizzas and was told they didn't have any. I ordered a pizza and mozzarella and tomato salad for our table of 3 (two adults and one kiddo) ... I wish the waitress would have mentioned the size of the pizza. We definitely could have ordered one more - as it was, I left hungry and disappointed as it was absolutely delicious pizza. Will definitely go back and this time I'll know how much to order. :)",

I ordered 2 different pizzas because I wanted to try a variety: the margherita and the wise guy. The crust is soooooooooooooooo good. It's thin and crispy so it adds the perfect texture without taking anything away from the actual taste of the pizza. I could eat the margherita every single day. The wise guy, on the other hand, was rather bland. I took it to go so that I could add some spice to it when I got home. Figured it would be pretty insulting to them and embarrassing for me to ask if they had Tabasco or Sriracha sauce, haha. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pSQFynH1VxkfSmehRXlZWw?select=O45QSGlfaSoSq3RlJFBwiw#NkTxsHmspfEVP7LX9brMDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pSQF...</a>  Not sure if I'll drive from LA just to eat here again, but I will definitely be looking for an excuse to head in this direction.",

I had high expectations. When I saw it on a list of the top 10 downtown Phoenix restaurants, I decided to try it for lunch. While the service was decent, I was overall disappointed with the food.  We got there a few minutes after opening so it wasn't busy. The fans were on and the A/C even kicked on at one point before several customers requested for them to be turned off (we had a high of like 65).  We started off with some free bread that was cold and served with a large dish of oil with nothing else in it. I wish the bread had been warmed.  We ordered a market salad which was $9 and consisted of pieces of watermelon and grapefruit, shaved fennel and way too much juice from the fruits and (I think?) topped with parsley. Not sure why but the tastes just did not work for me.   I ordered a green salad instead and got a very large pile of fresh greens tossed in a vinaigrette. While there were 3 olives, there was nothing else. I wish there had been a couple of other flavored incorporated.  We ordered two pizzas (Sonny Boy and Wiseguy) which people seemed to be ordering one per person. For $18 each, I expected them to be the best ever.  The white Wiseguy pizza had roasted onion and fennel sausage. It seemed rather bland to me.  The red Sonny Boy's best feature were the olives but I really felt the whole thing was disappointing. There was nothing special about any of the tastes to me and the prices seemed too high.  I definitely prefer Cibo, Grimaldis and Spinatos. I've been told that other locations tend to be \"better\" but that is obviously here say. I will probably never try it again.",

I am a big eater so I ordered two large as the pizza is so thin it isn't a whole lot of food or for me very filling. I would say that the pizza is worth dining here. Will I go back?

    "text": "Pizzeria Bianco is probably it's own worst enemy.  I probably lived in Phoenix about 5 years before I finally trekked it downtown on Saturday night and went.  We had to wait 3 hours to get seated.  I spent those 3 hours taking beers to my dome piece.  There is a waiting bar next door, as well as the underrated British pub Rose and Crown across the street.  By the time we got seated, I was certainly ready to house some pizza.    The pizza is good.  It's really good.  But is it worth the hype that it gets?  No.  It isn't substantially better than some other places around town, such as LGO.  For as popular as this place is, it is very affordable.    My advise: store some beers in your gullet for safe keeping.  Wait.  Pound some more beers. Repeat until you are seated.  i think that's how Pizzeria Bianco gets from good to great: and uses insane wait times to their advantage.",

    "text": "Yum - these pizzas would be good with traditional toppings but they were even better because of the unique offerings that you won't find at other pizzerias.  I ordered the pizza with pistachios on top and it was delicious.  We also got a pizza with arugula on top.  Bonus points for having multiple vegetarian-friendly pizzas.  All of them are wood fired for that perfectly crispy, crunchy crust that I love.  It's tucked away in a cute brick building - looks like a repurposed warehouse.  There is seating outside, and on this particular day half of them were shaded, so we enjoyed dining al fresco.  There's also a valet lot adjacent to the building, so plenty of convenience!",

So we went downtown and because of the reviews we purposefully went early. We got there around 4:45. Just in time for the Zombie walk. Lucky us. So we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We went next door to the bar and each had a glass of wine and the antipasti and crostini. $60 later..    We get a table. We each got a pizza and I got the farmers market salad to share. It was priced according to the items they put into it. It was $9. It had lettuce, and red onion and blue cheese which we got on the side. Really. It was not large. It had nothing else on it. To me that's not a salad. I thought being a farmers market salad there would be other veggies on it but I guess the market was closed.  The pizza was unremarkable. It wasn't even very warm. I like cold pizza too but this didn't make it. And It was worse the next day.    I love trying new places. I love pizza and salad. I just can't find a thing to make me go back to this place.  Not even if someone else was paying.",

Oh boy-the Sonny Boy was beautifully bold and bountiful with mouthwatering and fresh toppings. I enjoy pizza and this was by far the BEST authentic PIZZA I have ever had. The sauce and crust were exceptional!   And the icing on the cake was the great service and conversation before the crowds with Dave at the bar.....was great to have someone who was easy on the eyes to go with the pizza pie!",

    "text": "I don't see what all the hype is about.  Like, not at all.  I'm beginning to think that a lot of people in Phoenix have absolutely NO idea what good food really is.  Maybe I got really spoiled with all the east coast yumminess in Philly, D.C. and New York.  My expectations are set pretty high and Pizzeria Bianco just didn't meet any of them.  The atmosphere is super cute, typical city like restaurant where tables are close and its nice and loud and crowded.  But it pretty much stops there.  The pizza was just ok.  I'd be pretty pissed if I waited over an hour for what I feel like is pretty generic pizza.  There was nothing special that stood out about this pizza.  Someone please tell me what is so special or different about the pizza here because I just don't see it.  The atmosphere at Cibo is much better and I think the pizza there was a lot better.    Service was horrible! How do restaurants here get away with having such terrible servers.  Just because you're popular doesn't mean you have to treat your customers like they are bothering you. I have no idea what our servers name was, he never asked if we'd been there before, described nothing on the menu, didn't ask if we had any questions.  Simply asked what we wanted to eat and that was it.  I had to ask for a drink.  I mean, really?? Hello!!  You're not at all concerned that someone may actually want a glass of water or soda or wine with their meal.  This I simply do not understand.    I will not be returning to Pizzeria Bianco and certainly will not be recommending it to anyone.",

The second time we visited was a Friday night, we were with some friends and wanted to show the place off to them. We were seated and waited 45 minutes before someone took our drink orders! They were extremely busy and clearly understaffed. They didn't bring out drinks, and we waited another 45 minutes until we got fed up and asked for a server to take our meal orders! They'd forgotten about us and I guess hadn't assigned a server to our table! 1.5 hours of just waiting. At first we were just catching up and chatting, but 1.5 hours and no service became ridiculous and embarrassing. Eventually we got to eat, and it was nice, but the service put a damper on the whole night. Our friends have a bad taste in their mouth for Pizzeria Bianco, and insist the Pomo is the better joint. We try to argue with them, but our experience together says otherwise.",

I ordered the Margharita pizza (cost $15) and it came out quick.  All the pizzas here only come in one size.   I ate the whole pizza and it tasted fresh.  You can taste the wood grill flavor in the crust.  The pizza is light and you won't feel disgusting after you eat it...which is refreshing compared to other pizza places.

Pizza Bianco was good when very few Pizzerias sold Neapolitan Pizza.   Now they are just an expensive average Pizza place with crappy service.  Issues:  1. IF you own a restaurant, make using a personal phone by the staff a firing offense.    2. Valet parking for an average Pizza, I think NOT.  3. Poor variety.  4. Inattentive Service  5.  Burnt Pizza, I like a dark wood-fired pizza, not ash covered cremains.    6.  Save you bucks, do a search for wood oven pizza and try some of the other valley Pizza locations.  5 within a couple of blocks!!!",

We show up 20mins later after we call and its about 445. I walk in and I see a waiting list laying on the counter, figure you write your name on it. I write my name on it and the same chick that answered the phone earlier says \"that's my job\" , maybe you should do it then. So I ask how long the wait is and she says 1hr, what!!  We decided to wait since we were going to the ball game afterwards.  we ordered 5 pizzas. I got the Rosa pizza and it was good except my crust was burnt and VERY hard, hardest crust EVER, couldnt even bite thru some of the pieces, my daughter even cut the crack of her mouth. it was crazy. We shared pieces from the other pizzas and 3 of the 5 had perfect crust.  I don't remember the name of my favorite but it was really good. there pizza is all about the dough and if they don't over cook it.   it wasn't the best pizza but it might be the best dough when they don't screw it up. I would like to go back but not going to do it with the wait and the service that's provided.",

For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!",

We put out name in and was told it would be about a 90 minute wait, and told the building next door was the place for drinks and appetizers while we wait. The building itself was great, as I love the old houses that have been saved. Forgive me inaccuracy; I believe we were told it was built around 1909, relocated to this spot and restored. Nicely decorated with period furniture; great ambiance. Ordered a wine and beer and an antipasti plate. The grilled vegetables were good, although I don't know that I would have ordered it if I knew there were parsnips and brussel sprouts. It truly was about 90 minutes before we were told they found a spot for us.  The pizza was great. Simple, fresh ingredients. One pizza was enough for us after the antipasti. I think you'll find that the reason for the long wait is due to the small main building and the love and care put into the baking in the wood burning ovens. It was an enjoyable evening. Curiosity satisfied",

Having heard and read about the marvelous pizza served at Pizzeria Bianco, we naturally decided to pay a visit. We called several days in advance for reservation for our party of eight (the eatery accepts reservations for six or over). We were told no reservations were available and that we were welcome to come and stay in line; a wait of several hours. Our party consists of two octogenarians, two individuals disabled by diabetes and two young children. Under the circumstances we requested an accommodation. This was refused by Carey (sp?), who went on to say that under no circumstances does Pizzeria Bianco make exceptions, never have and never will (even the French Laundry in Yountville is not that rigid). She absolutely refused to let me speak to her manager.  Carrey went on to say she frankly didn't care about any of the circumstances and that her establishment was above any criticism at Yelp or Zagat. Well, maybe so, but I am not so sure that our elderly and disabled colleagues will agree. What say you? Let's educate these folks about the price of arrogance. Chris are you listening? PML",

    "text": "Being a Yelper, I have anticipated my visit to Pizzeria Bianco for over a year.  I finally got the opportunity to go to night!  Fellow Yelper from Houston, Ryan, was in town for work again and invited me out.  We met up at the wine bar next door and got a cheese plate.  Three different kinds of cheese, all really good and tangy!  The thin bread the came with was a bit too crunchy to eat with cheese on it, but tasty nonetheless.  Finally, after a two hour wait, we were called! We're in!  I'm going to Pizzeria Bianco!!!! We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of \"micro-arugula\" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!   We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!   I'm full.  I'm exhausted.  I had had a strange and mildly crappy day, and this made it worthwhile. I'll be back.  To me, definitely worth the wait!  I only wish my Buffalo sister, Jennifer, could have had such a good experience before leaving the Valley.",

Unfortunately, they don't have to care -- thanks to dumbshit Oprah, the masses will continue to come. That's OK -- they can have my place in line.",

The food looked delicious, and came out quickly, but was way too salty.  Bordering on inedible.  I was excited for the cheese/prosciutto appetizer, but couldn't finish it.   The pizza was equally salty, and to make matters worse- the center was soggy and the outside was blackened.   Didn't finish that either.   Maybe I went on an off night?    Bottom line: definitely doesn't live up to the hype.  Oh- and as for the wait....it was about 90minutes, which was expected (Monday at 5:30pm).",

    "text": "BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD CONFIRMED!!!!  I have sampled pizza from around the world and who would of thought that such perfection could come out of PHX!!! I am sorry I think some of you guys are griping just to gripe about this place.  So you have to wait and yes it can be multiple hours , but when that first bite of your perfectly crafted pizza hits your taste buds BAM!  I get taken away on a magical journey full of artisan mozzarella, Italian cheeses, house made sausage, perfect sauce,  all served on the perfect vessel made to carry all these ingredients to the top of Mt. Olympus where the gods consume such pizza goodness!   I feel like everyone has a story about how they got to PB and here is mine: I recently worked in England at one of the best restaurants in the world.  The chef has a book series called \"The Search For Perfection\".  One of the recipes from the book was the perfect pizza.  After this book was published (around 2 years ago) there was a constant discussion at work who served the best pizza in the world. Of course all the Europeans would say Italy, but there was always one or two chefs that would speak of the holy grail of pizza found in PHX. This is where I first heard of Pizzeria Bianco's magic.  I felt a little confused at first.  I always thought the best pizza in the country at least was found in NYC, but to hear that such a place existed in PHX that not only was best in country , but best in world I had to find a way to get there.  Finally the day came!  I was in town for a convention, but all I could think about was this pizza and I had not even had one yet.    It was a Thursday night and I told all my coworkers we are going here.  I get them together around 430 and get over there at 5 and I already see the place is packed!  I am a little worried on how long the wait was going to be , but I was prepared to wait as long as possible.  I was there after all to eat pizza and nothing else.  The beautiful hostess approached me and told me that the wait would be 4 hours!  I was totally prepared but my co workers were not.  They decided no food is worth waiting that long for, but of course they were wrong.  I did not know what to do and proceeded to freak out a little.  Thinking I wouldn't get to try a piece of this ambrosial pizza.  It turns out during this time we were trying to figure out what to do another company had offered to take us out to dinner.  Now dinner had become business and I had to go.  This was around 630.    They had reservations at this sushi place.  We sat down at seven and I begin to get more and more depressed that I might miss this pizza because this is our last night in town.  I snuck to the bathroom to call a friend so they can tell me what time PB stops serving.  I found out the last call is 10 and if you make by 10 you will be served.  Things are looking up!  I sort of rush us through a big sushi dinner.  In the back of my mind I didn't think I was going to make it because of the consumption of sushi, but I knew in my heart of hearts that I would make it.  As soon I get back to the hotel , around 845, I call a taxi and snuck away to the mecca of pizza AGAIN!  I get there around 920 and I get a sense of relief as soon as I smell the wood fired oven once again.  This hostess was pleased to see me again and told me I had about an hour to wait.  I was all by myself, full off sushi, and I couldn't even sit because I was so excited for what lies a head.   I pace impatiently outside and scowl at all the patrons in the restaurant hoping that it might hasten their meals.    Finally,  its my turn!  I get seated at the bar.  I immediately know what I want.  I could not make up my mind, so I just decide to order two pizzas!  I am a gourmand.  I order the Margarita because that is a True test of what a pizza maker is made out of and the Bianco verde.  The waiter even commented how he liked my style.  I told him I was doing important research and he understood.  I nearly cried when the first pizza came out.  The artisan look and smell was unbelievable.  The taste!!!  oh my god the taste!!!!  I am salivating now just writing about the smokey unadulterated perfection only created by such ovens and hands of a master.  I could not complete both of the pies and figured I would later and took them home.  Still at home hours later the pizza carried the magic of the restaurant with it.  I am truly humbled by my experience at Pizzeria Bianco.  I had the chance to talk to Chris Bianco , who is there every night making your pizza , I told him of my adventure getting to his place and he was very grateful.  This was def a highlight of my gastronomic experiences and would recommend this to anybody to do at least once before you died.  And all you haters need to look past the wait and the scene and just look at the pizza.",

A friend came to visit from NYC and it was his one request to eat there.  We picked him up at the airport and went straight there for lunch.  Somehow we got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table.  Although I thought the pizza was good and I especially liked the flavor of the fresh mozzarella cheese on the pie, I think it is over rated.  I live here in the Phoenix area but would not go out of my way to eat here again.",

Bar Bianco is next door and a nice atmosphere to wait in, making me usually a few glasses of wine deep when I finally get to eat, which makes the food that much better.  They also offer appetizers at Bar Bianco which are good if you are starving. The Wiseguy pizza is my favorite, the fennel sausage is just unreal it's so good.  A close runner up is the Biancoverde with arugula and ricotta, delicious!  I also love the Margherita. Every bite just melts in your mouth.  To start I always get the Spiedini, which is super salty and amazing.  The salads are always as fresh as can be and the bread is great, too.  It's all about the individual ingredients here- everything is really fresh and simple, and SO good! I think that its worth the wait as long as you are in a mood to not mind waiting and you really want some amazing, fresh pizza.",

    "text": "I agree 100% with some of the reviewers who address the long wait time and the issue about what constitutes as some of the world's best pizza.  Our group of six were well-informed about what to expect were therefore comfortably prepared for an absolutely great experience.  We were told that there would be a two hour wait, so we arrived at Pizzeria Bianco's at 5:00 p.m., put our name down, and happily passed the time away with champagne, great beer, and a nice cheese and salami plate at Bar Bianco's.  It gave us a chance to relax, catch up with one another, and develop a great buzz (and appetite!) before we were seated.    Sure enough, we were seated on-time and there was great energy in the restaurant.  The decor was quaint, simple and not pretentious.  Despite the huge pizza oven that became an interesting focal point in the restaurant and could be seen from any point in the dining room, it was comfortably cool for its patrons in the Phoenix heat!  The place is a bit small and I wouldn't recommend going with more than 6 people.  For those who complain about this factor, I've learned through my travels that some of the coolest locations in the world like the Devil's Throat which accommodates only one spelunker at a time in its cave passages, or the little booth in the Parisian cafe that accommodates a maximum of four people at a time  - not every place can always accommodate you - sometimes YOU have to accommodate the place and sometimes you have to sacrifice a little for the experience.  (Alrighty, I guess that's enough ranting about the Ugly American from me!).  The place has a casual vibe and there were plenty of patrons in t-shirts and shorts, but I would feel like I were disrespectful of the whole experience if my husband hadn't worn at least a collared shirt with his shorts.  We all had shorts on, but were dressed nicer than if we were just going to the local taco stand.    We ordered 5 out of the 6 pies on the menu and we also ordered two salads (plenty of food for all of us just as the waiter had advised).  The caprese salad (tomatoes and mozzarella) had some of the tastiest mozzarella I've ever had!  All of the pies were great and I would not be the least bit hesitant to order any of them again, but my personal favorites were the Margherita and the Sonny Boy.  Not surprisingly,  everyone at our table had a different favorite because they were all great.  Overall, not only was the thin crust a perfect combination of chewy and crispy, but it was also tasty - I could eat the crust without any toppings (one prerequisite for me in a great pizza - like fresh home made pasta that doesn't need anything but a little olive oil and sea salt).  Each pie was a work of art - just beautifully rustic and easily identifiable since the toppings were certainly not hiding under a ton of cheese - they were lying on top in all their naked glory.  So people want to know - how does it compare to authentic Italian Pizza or New York Pizza?  I don't know.  It's Pizzeria Bianco's pizza!    Now the all important final answer everyone wants to know - is Pizzeria Bianco's the best pizza in the world?  I can't say for sure - I haven't been to Italy or a bunch of other places in the world that has pizza, but with impeccably fresh ingredients, undoubtedly good food, a great atmosphere, and courteous service, it is up there with some of the greatest pizza and greatest and most memorable pizza experiences I've ever had.  That's good enough for me to give this place five stars.",

I have been here MANY times before and never once would I have given my pizza less than 9.5/10. Each pizza is handmade by the owner and baked in a stone, wood-fired oven. Who could ask for more?  There seem to be a few people that don't understand the hours of waiting required to get a taste. Considering the entire building (including kitchen) is likely under 1000 sq ft, I think Bianco and his staff do an impeccable job at keeping things moving along. Sadly, they even have an entire additional building next door used just as a bar/waiting room. If you hear or read about people complaining of the wait, I would probably file these people under \"scrooges.\"",

We chatted up with the couple that had been ahead of us in line and enjoyed a beautiful evening in the garden area.   We each got a pizza and they were both delicious. Everything tasted so fresh. The crust was cooked to perfection. We sat right next to the oven and it was so cool watching Chris make everything. We will definitely be back and bring friends next time.",

We got there around 7:30 on a Friday night and were seated by 10:30.  We went to the wine bar next door that Bianco owns and hung out for those three hours.  It's really not too bad a wait if you have bevvies, a cheese plate, and good convo.  Plus, the hostess comes from Bianco comes over to the bar to let you know your table is ready - a big plus.   We had the Sonny Boy and the plain cheese (I forget the name), as well as the \"house\" salad (also forget the name, but it was the basic one).  Everything people have said is True - the ingredients are sooooo fresh and the flavors melt together extremely well.  Plus, being Italian and from the east coast, I am a huge fan of thin-crust pizza - I haaaate thick, soggy, greased-up pizza.  Bianco makes his pizza crust paper-thin so that you can actually enjoy the flavors of the toppings and cheese rather than be chewing on a french baguette.  It's definitely worth checking out, but do not go there when you are starving, have a snack first - the wait will kill you.",

I would tell you about it ( HERE)...   but you know what its that good. I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code. I would love to say don't believe  \"the hype\" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night.   Lets really face the reality of that night though. You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect. While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.  This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients. The thin cust is perfect.  The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant. We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior / treatment is normal.   Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ.",

    "text": "Totally worth the wait!  We only waited about 2.5 hours, which the average wait is about 3-4.  It  really depends upon when you get there.  If you don't like waiting, then don't go, save some room for us foodies, those locals and us travelers that appreciate the art of food!   If Gayle (Oprah's friend), Martha Stewart like the pizza, then what more can you ask to know about PB.  PB is also highly recommended by Wine Spectator (June 08), Vogue and The New York Times.  PB truly lived up to all the hype an exceeded my taste buds!  However those who know me, know that I love food and I will travel for the experience.  PB is now on my top 5 restaurants!  You can enjoy the wait and relax by drinking a glass of wine from the bar (they own next door).  You can drink outside in front, or on the park benches, tables and seating next door on the patio.  Relax, enjoy life and  take in all of the scenery including the local garden.  However, make sure you leave someone in line at all times to save your spot and perhaps rotate.  My wife and I enjoyed a glass of Aardvark Pinot Noir which was fantastico!  The appetizers looked terrific, but I wanted to save room for pizza.  We migrated over to the long table outside Pizzeria Bianco and the staff is so organized, that they write down your location while you wait so they know where to find you (this happens once they are open and your name is on a LIST).    If you have ever had pizza in Rome, Italy, then this is next best place to visit!  It rivals a place that was highly recommended by Rick Steve's (travel guru), somewhere near the Pantheon.   My Favs: BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage.  The fennel sausage is awesome!  We did not order enough of this pizza!    We also had the MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil, but it was not one of our favorites.  A great sauce though!  Perhaps we should have added a topping!  We ordered some appetizers all of which were good.  The \"Handmade Mozzarella, Local Tomato and Basil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil\" appetizer was fantastic.  The best mozzarella I have had since Cortona, Italy.   Not sure how they got such ripe tomatoes for this time of year.  Perhaps they have great suppliers and they get to hand pick every tomato.   Our service was fantastic, from the bar tender next door (great wine and beer recommendation), to the waiter (cheerful, high energy).  We  enjoyed listened to all of the recommendations and watching the Chris Bianco chef/owner in action!    Tips:  If you get there early, there is free parking.  If you get there late, you can park in public parking and they will validate your ticket (discounted rate).  Since I wrote this review, the May 2009 issue of Martha Stewart's Living magazine hit the stands with a great write up of this top restaurant.  Recipes are included in this issue.",

    "text": "All the raves about Pizzeria Bianco are True. To an extent.  The Pizza is fabulous (although not the best I've ever had).  The service is beyond impeccable and the entire atmosphere is befitting its exclusivity. And the price, while not cheap, is pretty reasonable for such an intimate setting with an experience that people obviously crave.  As you'd guess, we waited an hour in line just to put our name in, and then two hours after that to get a table (in fairness, we had a party of 8, so that probably contributed to a bit of the wait).  To me, it wasn't quite worth all of the fuss. I'm sure they'd argue that they don't expand for quality control reasons and to keep the experience what it is, but to me it just means I have to wait for something where the ends don't quite justify the means.  I mean, hey, still four stars.  The bar next door was fun as well, so the wait wasn't exactly painful, but unless they drop the wait time, once was probably enough for me at Pizzeria Bianco.",

Got there at around 6 to beat the crowd.  Charming old building with a hip fun atmosphere.  Service was timely and very personable.  Recommendations were thoughtful and relevant.  The food was AMAZING.  We split a salad and the sausage pizza.  I didn't want it to end.  I could have just eaten the sausage and been happy.  The crust and the smoky flavor from the pizza oven threw me over the edge.  Highly recommend just for the flavor.  Throw in great location and awesome service and you have the trifecta!  It is important to note that this is a very small place with just a few tables and a small bar.  Not ideal for big groups.",

    "text": "We had three pizza's - Margherita with garlic and salami, Margherita with fennel sausage, and a white Piazza Blanco.  All three were unbelievably delicious.  Our waiter was phenomenal.  He has been working at the restaurant since it first opened in 1994.  They have a small but very good wine selection and nice beers.   I have to add that we are originally from New Haven, CT where the #1 rated pizza restaurant in the US is located - Pepe's pizza, and we loved this place.  Will definitely go back.  It is very close to the ball park and looks like a great place to go before the game if you get there before the crowds.",

    "text": "Yelp has lead me to this place...so I want to add my input for all of the Phoenix visitors going, \"where do you want to eat?\" and finding this restaurant in your mobile devices or at your hotel/friend's house.   Pizza is good...top 5 of my pizza places...actually I cannot name more than 4 places that I LOVED for pizza, but this is not good enough to commit to my top 3. My standards are not too high, as you can read from my other reviews.   Ok...so this area is pretty nice...I happen to be there during August when the temperatures are 100+ and there are no people walking around. I think not many people do walk around. We get there, and place our name and wait the 4.5 hours...we end up going shopping, looking around stores, the area, and staying at the pub next door to play pool, but still...we were waiting 4.5 hours. It was HOT waiting.   We finally got to our table and looked over the very simple menu. There were around 6 pizza choices, two antipasto dishes, few salads, and that as pretty much it. There were 6 of us, but we ordered 4 pizzas which happened to have 6 slices each, so we got that and were ok with the portions that we ate. We asked about ordering stuff to go because my friends wanted to share this \"highly rated\" pizza with their families in Glendale, but the waiter said that we were only allowed to place in 1 order. This is kind of sucky because if you were to order something and decided later that you wanted more food, they probably would say that you cant...so that knocks off a few points on my \"should i go back meter\"   The pizzas were good. wood fired stuff, thin crust, good cheese, good sauce, salty sausage, decent prosciutto. Not worth the wait. at all. I mean...yeah it's good, but not too good...but it's good.   I won't be going there if i happen to be in phoenix...unless there's a lot of time and I get there as soon as it opens waiting in front on a cool arizona night.",

    "text": "After having eaten Pizza at the most heralded Pizza joints in the US: A16 (San Francisco), Serious Pie (Seattle) - (see the recent Wine Spectator- June 2008). I'd have to say that Pizzeria Bianco is the winner. But, only barely. The Bianco Pizza was more consistent all the way through. The A16 pizza last time I had it was a little soggy in comparison the Biancos.   We didn't do anything correctly for showing up at Biancos. We showed up at 8pm. And, waited for a table for 2.5 hours. It worked out well, because we just went next door and had a few glasses of wine before dinner. This worked out well and waiting isn't a problem (as long as you're with cool people).  The wait was surely worth it. Bianco only serves 6 pizzas. Only 2 with red sauce. But, the ingridents used were probably the most selective in Arizona. Think Thomas Keller particularism in Arizona. And, that's very difficult to do in Arizona - b/c the ingredients here inherently suck.",

After a three hour wait (I only put up with that because an out of town guest wanted to go), the waiter was rude and acted as though he could care less about our satisfaction.  As for the pizza, it's not your 'normal' style which would be fine if it was good or an unusual treat, but it wasn't either.  And pricey to boot.  Not a place I'd suggest; Phoenix has many better locations to spend your $$ and get some great food.",

    "text": "\"There's no way that this place can live up to the expectations\" was the common consensus amongst our group of six that dined here last night.  Before we get there though, flashback to 2008.  One year ago, I heard of this place.  After hearing about the unbelievable wait and unwilling to invest 3+ hours of time regardless of the deliciousness of the pizza, I placed Pizzeria Bianco in a spot in my mind reserved for the unattainable such as owning my own private island or being with Megan Fox.  Then one day, somebody informed me that Bianco accepts reservations for groups of 6+.  Hallelujah!  I immediately made a reservation only to find that the first available was about a month later.  Undeterred, I booked it.  When the day came, I was not disappointed with appearances!  There's something about the decor of both the Pizzeria and the little bar next door that makes it very inviting.  It almost felt like I was showing up at a party that somebody invited me to.  The food itself was good, almost great, but again, with the expectations and the wait, it was difficult to fulfill.  The sampler appetizer platters showcased some wonderful cheeses and olives and cured meats.  The salads were crisp and flavorful.  The pizza itself was a little thin and crispy-crusted for my personal liking, but the ingredients were fresh as can be and delicious.  One thing that I missed was more of an emphasis on tomato-based pizzas, which amongst our group, was the first pizza to be quickly snatched up and eaten.  Overall, a wonderful experience, but I don't know if I'd come back again simply due to the logistical coordination required and the high price blowing my expectations beyond what could be satiated.",

    "text": "Oh man let me tell you about this place. I have been here a few times before and they recently started opening for lunch, which might I add was the greatest thing EVER.  We went on a Friday. They open at 11:00 and we were seated right away. within 30 minutes this restaruant was full and there was a wait. Granted there are only about 8-10 (2) seater tables and 6-7 (4) seated tables and maybe 8-10 seats at the bar. Still 30 MINUTES. I do have to say that they have a wine and appitizer bar/house next door for you to sit and mingle while waiting for a seat to open for you.  I got the margherita pizza minus the basil add  prosciutto. Man this is the best pizza I have EVER had. The sause is super simple which is awesome. They cook it in the brick oven pizza stove and when it comes out they put the prosciutto on it. My partmer got the wise guy pizza and added muswhroom. Same thing she always gets, that should tell you how good it is. She also for the daily salad, which was fennel, parsley, watermelon in a light lemony juicy. She said it taste like summer.  I am a pizza fan, like one of those ones that can buy a frozen one from the store and be just as happy with it. So for me to say this is the best, LISTEN PEOPLE.  SIDE NOTE: They do not accept reservations and If you get there in the evening on a weekend you are going to be looking at a 2 hour wait. Trust me though it will be worth it",

    "text": "We went down to phoenix on a road trip to Sedona and Grand Canyon to try this famous pizza. It was a 360 miles detour for Pizza.  We got there 4:40PM and waited in line for 20 minutes for the place to open to put our name down on the list. After that, we waited another hour and 40 minutes to be seated. Total wait time was 2 hours.  We were sat at the bar because we said we would take first available seat. It turned out to have the waiter in front of you which means real good service.  We ordered Antipasto, tomato and mozzarella salad, Magharita pizza, and Wiseguy pizza. After we ordered, the waiter asked us if we've been there before because we ordered the best things on the menu which made me feel pretty good.  Well, the moment of truth to justify our big detour to try this pizza place finally came when they delivered all this food we ordered. Antipasto was very good, the grilled vegetable was so fresh and sweet. Tomato and mozzarella was excellent, the fresh mozzarella was so good. The pizza which we drove 6 hours and waited 2 hours for??? Were they good?? Yes! they were very good. The crust was the best we ever had. It was light, fluffy, crispy and thin. The sauce on Magharita was so tasty. And you know what? they were not even made by the famous chef Chris Bianco. That's right, we saw him only briefly for couple minutes and he went hiding for most of the time we were dining.  During the dinner, we heard one patron sitting at the bar asked the guy next to him \"was it worth it?\" If he had asked me, I would've said \"no\". The truth is pizza was very good, but for us to travel this far plus long wait and hoping to get some \"to die for\" pizza was too high of an expectation. I would not do this ever again, unless I happened to be in Phoenix and there is no wait.",
