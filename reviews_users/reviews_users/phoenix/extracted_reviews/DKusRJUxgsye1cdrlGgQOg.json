    "text": "As someone who has traveled extensively throughout India and sampled various regions of authentic Indian cuisine, I find that Udupi keeps the best parts of traditional Indian fare and omits the overwhelming amount of oil that is often used heavily in preparation.  The items I tried were the Palaak Paneer, Cauliflower Gobi Manchurian, Lentil Soup and Spinach Dosai. We went for dinner and the buffet was not available so we ordered a la carte.  Every single thing including the rice that was delicately flavored with spices, was 100% without a doubt some of the most flavorful, fresh and well-balanced Indian food I've ever put in my mouth.   The balance of the intense and unique spices used in Indian food was exquisite.   Most of the time, Indian food is over powered by one of the flavors or is too high on the scoville scale.   In spite of this modest strip-mall restaurant being nestled in between the Motel 6, a laundromat and Jim's Coney Island Grill, it is without a doubt my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley.",

Because it is on an intersection with no traffic light, getting into the parking lot from the northbound lane requires a left turn into traffic. Likewise, exiting the parking lot to go north requires a left turn against lots of traffic. Furthermore, the parking lot itself is a problem, being cramped as all get out. Finally, the restaurant is next door to a dingy laundromat populated by some unsavory folk.",

There was hardly any \"MASAL\". (Potato curry). The dessert was drenched in sugar syrup.  The entire restaurant looked like it needed a through cleaning. This used to be owned by a person from south India. I guess he sold it and moved on.  Having a gourmet cook myself, this place needs the attention of FDA to make sure it is properly cleaned.

I've been a fan of Indian food since my first taste of Aloo Gobi, and being a west-sider, I am very rarely in this part of town, however this little gem is worth the trip.  Being in the East Valley for a meeting with my vegetarian co-worker, we couldn't pass on trying out this place.  After one trip to the buffet, we were not only hooked, we were already full.    I have  been to a lot of Indian buffets around town, and this one introduced me to a lot of new items, and tastes, I had never experienced before.  Being strictly vegetarian (and some vegan), you did not have all those \"regular\" dishes you find in the other buffets (tandori chicken, lamb curries..etc.), so they were replaced by new and exciting delicacies.  The mushoom tikka masala was so go, I could have pulled my chair up to the buffet and stayed for the day.  We were also introduced to Dosai, or rice crepes, this variety filled with potato and onion.    If you happen to find yourself in this part of town, a visit here is something you will not regret.  OH...One last thing...  You know how they say that you can tell an ethnic restaurant is good if \"they\" eat there.  Well during my visit, ALL the other guests were Indian!      'Nough said!",

Everything is flavorful and filling, you don't feel \"deprived\" just because there is no meat.  And I'm not hungry 30 min later after eating here, like I am with most other vegetarian dining places.  This place was a favorite dinner spot for me and my friends wayyy back in college.  Hadn't been back in years, but I recently returned to try it again and was happy to find that the quality had not changed.  Still great delicious food at really reasonable prices.  My favorites here are their vegetable samosas which come out piping hot to your table, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  I also love the vegetable curry, although I wish it was more sauce-y, so I could have something to dip their yummy bread into.  Their fluffy bread is so fun because it's HUGE!  no way you could finish an order by yourself in one sitting. and I don't know if \"fluffy\" is quite the correct word to describe it, bc it is a bit heavier due to being fried.  probably \"chewy\" is a better word for it?  either way, it's yummy.  The only thing to note is that the garlic bread is super duper extremely crazy garlic-ky.  I love garlic, but this bread was too much for me.  I would stick to the unflavored breads when dining here.",

Staying there for Christmas. Talked to a man counting receipts and cash at a table, presumably the owner, and asked for the box and gave them an opportunity to give it back to us. He only looked behind the front area and he said it wasn't there and no deliveries had been made.   We spoke to UPS and the driver specifically who stated the box was in fact dropped there and signed for by \"Vide\". I then called the restaurant again, explaining we had just confirmed they had received our box. I got attitude thrown at me by the same man and the woman who answered the phone essentially refused to help or check the back.   I let the man/owner know the driver would be circling back after his route to get our box. The owner gave me a \"bring it on\" attitude. All we wanted were our slime jars for our kids, buddy. They're of no value to you!  So UPS, showing us amazing service and dedication to make things right for us 2 days before Christmas, went back to the restaurant at 8 pm, confronted the business a out withholding our package, and retrieved it back for us. We were able to get it on Saturday morning after going to their warehouse and waiting in line for an hour.   These people are thieves. They'll take your packages. And heads up? He admitted there was another box there that had been there for 3 months that they hadn't bothered to return to sender. Theft!",

    "text": "My friend recommended this place since she's vegan. If you haven't been to a Indian restaurant before, I would start here because their price isn't too bad. I paid $12 dollars for lunch and it was all you can eat (vegetarian and vegan) foods. When you arrive they will ask you if you want their bread which is like a pita that has potatoes in the middle of it. It's very good! I also tried their mango drink, I forgot what it was called but it was alright. I've had better. I think I would only go here for lunch not for dinner because that's just too much food for a late dine.",

We were really hoping for the buffet, but they only have that in the morning (11am-3pm daily).  After browsing the menu, we opted for the vegetable manchurian & the South Indian Thali. The Vegetable Manchurian was really tasty & was a very large portion (it was definitely priced well considering the quantity); the manchurian was a not very spicy, which I appreciated as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (silly, I know, considering South Indian food is always really spicy). The South Indian Thali was very large as well & contained really spicy items ... It was also worth the money.  The service was good - it wasn't very busy on the week night that we went on & they had a new waitress - she asked us a couple of times if she could get anything out of the way when there was clearly still food remaining on all the plates - we didn't mind as she did note it was her first day. We'd definitely recommend this restaurant & will be back!",

    "text": "This review is long overdue.  While visiting Bangalore (where I ate delicious dosai with chutney every morning) in 2005 I met up with one of my friends from college who had grown up there. A few months later, back in Arizona, I asked him where I could find authentic South Indian food, and he recommended Udupi Cafe.  I've been hooked ever since.  This has been my favorite place to bring friends and family members, and now that I live out of state I make sure that every visit to Arizona includes at least one trip to Udupi.  I've dined at countless Indian restaurants in several cities and states across the U.S., and this one is still my favorite.  The lunch buffet is a great deal -- curries, paratha, idli, desserts, biryani, salad, raita, papadum, and chutneys are served, plus chai or Indian coffee and UNLIMITED DOSAI!!  All for about $12.  Dinner prices are higher, but then they really knock it out of the park on quality so it is definitely worth it either way.  Besides, I always end up with 1-2 meals of leftovers after eating dinner here (and I'm a man with a sturdy frame), so you are not going to be ripped off here.  All dishes are fully vegetarian (like me, yay!) and there are many vegan and gluten-free options as well.  My wife has a severe gluten and dairy intolerance, and she eats here just fine.    The staff have always been really sweet and helpful.  The wall artwork is beautiful, and the music is awesome.",

The service was pretty good except the individual we were asking questions did not know anything as today was his first day at work. Seems they got hold of a warm body to be present. He did not know the basics of a restaurant business.  Overall we were disappointed and am over it. It will take a lot for us to return back here.",

At last check they still don't even want to participate for a letter grade and seems to have a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues.   Being a veg place I figured, that even a few health issues can't kill me, at worst I would get some good quality time with a book so we gave it a try.  We started with the Gobi manchurian, It is listed under dishes but it works best as an appetizer. This dish is great and their execution worked quite well. We had a massive dosa which was great with the many dipping sauces. We also had a vegetable vindaloo that was forgettable.   Over all the food was good and no one got sick. Prices are on part with any sit down indian place.  The ambiance is a bit odd",

The poor server was so busy running around that she even forgot our bill, and then when we waited for her at the counter, she calculated our total incorrectly!

After having a few games of Buckhunt at the Stray Cat (and perhaps a pitcher of Miller High Life...I won't front), my companion and I decided we were hungry. Not wanting to resort to Four Peaks in Tempe for food, he suggested Green restaurant-finally! A Flexatarian (def. someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal and understands that a person may not eat meat and still like food) who understood my lactose-intolerance wasn't just to be difficult!  So we stopped by Green..and they are closed on Sundays. Damn.  We drive down Scottsdale road, saddened by the rainy Sunday night, and he spots this Indian restaurant. I pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas...uh-uh folks. All vegetarian and vegan!  We are welcomed warmly to a full house and realize quickly we are the only white people there (SCORE!). I order us the appetizer sampler-WHICH IS HUGE. I mean, it had four sauces (the cilantro, coconut, tamarind..and some kind of chutney), pakoras, samosas, lentils, etc. We ended up cutting them all in half and taking them home. I had the Dosai with potatos, onions, chutney, peas and spices and loved it. I love tamarind sauce and I think the staff was please I did cause they give me a shitload. He ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy..but eerily like an enchilda. I also convinced him to indulge in the mango lassi (god, I miss those dairy yogurty drinks) and it was tasty-not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary, but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney.  The bathroom was nice, the staff was great, the decor was simply, all the Indian families were happy, I was happy, he was happy, and I had about 100 vegan items to choose from. Why the hell did I wait so long to go here?!? Please check it out!",

That's what I did - so I was the single guy in the corner looking at everyone watching what they took from the buffet, how they ate it, etc. They thought I was weird. The restaurant itself was nice - good parking right up front. I got there right at noon and it wasn't busy. The hostess was very friendly and the staff prompt and friendly. As for the food, I can't really tell you what I had, but it was good. I had a  soup, and tried a little of each of the dishes on the buffet. They brought out something and sat on the table. It was a crispy thing with something inside. I watched for others to eat theirs and joined in. It was pretty good.  I would definitely go back, but hopefully with someone that knows something about the food.",

    "text": "So, I have been giving vegetarianism a shot the past couple weeks. Pescetarian may be a better word, but that is neither here nor there. I was invited to join Amber W's Vegeversary on Friday night and this was the spot she picked. I will admit, I was a little scared by the veggie/vegan only at an Indian place. Being the good Yelper I am I decided a new place to review would be enough of a draw. Kidding Amber :)   I arrived a little late and the table had already ordered, but the server came by with a menu and I, along with my brother and a friend, were able to order rather quickly. The table had ordered some apps of Cauliflower Manchurian and Batura, which is a large puffy bread. The cauliflower was great and the bread reminded me of the skin Goldmember eats in the Austin Powers movie, but it tasted great.   My brother and I ordered the Vegetables Manchurian and the Onion and Hot Chili Uthappam. The veggies were mashed together into a ball and then sauteed. Very good with a little bit of a kick to them. The Uthappam was a giant pancake with onions and other spices. It was really good and I could have eaten the whole thing myself. It reminded me of a potato latke. We shared other dishes at the table with everyone else. There was a pretty wide variety of dishes. Some kind of spinach, a dish with peas and paneer(awesome, BTW), and couple of others that I wouldn't begin to find on the menu without help. Rice is brought out with all of the dishes and it was cooked perfectly.   We divied up the bill and it was very affordable for the amount of food we all got to eat. The place will not be a staple on my regular rotation, but if someone says that is where we are meeting for dinner, there won't be any hesitation going back.   Minus one star for the sub arctic temps where I was sitting.",

The service here is lackluster, our waiter actually told us that \"he only works here\" and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter. seriously?   The food is mediocre, the pakoras are dry and tasteless, we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them.  The dosa itself is good, the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality.   I would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed. As a 100% indian, i would recommend Jewel of the Crown over this cafe in an instant.",

This was my first time at Udupi, and can honestly say I went in with high expectations, and left wanting never to go back.   We got there at 2:40 and I asked the host, if it was too late to enjoy the buffet and if we should order from the menu or take the buffet- he insisted the buffet would be wonderful.  I mentioned that this was our first time here and asked if there was anything special we should try.  he said the buffet is wonderful and that while they close the buffet at 3, we should feel free to enjoy our lunch after.  Everything looked appetizing so we loaded our plates and sat down. The waiter brought out two dosa's for us and everything had the makings of a good lunch. BIG problem 1: Sadly, the food was cold, even the dosa they supposedly freshly made was cold- not just the crepe on the outside, which would naturally cool quickly, but the filling inside as well.  I mentioned the cold food to the waiter and he actually GRINNED and walked away.  Maybe he didn't hear me?  who knows.  Big Problem 2: Our host didn't tell us that it wasn't just the buffet that closed at 3, but the restaurant itself. Our waiter actually changed his clothes and left without even telling us!! I looked around for him, and the host came over and asked us \"what are you searching for?\" and i mentioned our waiter and he goes \"oh he went home, we are closed right now, we are all just waiting for you so we can also go\" so of course, we dropped our forks mid-bite got up and left- $13 per person!! when i mentioned the cold food, the host said that the food is cold because they turned off their food warmers over half an hour ago (um, thanks for the heads up)  You know, i could forgive the gaps in service if the food was stellar.  but it was eh, with the exception of the spinach kootu dish with was delicious.   I went up to the condiment bar and when i moved a ladle a bunch of fruit flies came out of the salad area- yuck.   WHY would anyone with any amount of self-respect serve a guest food they new was cold/sub par and then hurry them out of there.  If he had just said- hey we close completely in 20 mins, please join us for dinner I absolutely would have come back.  Greedy Greedy Greedy.   I sincerely hope my experience is an isolated incident, but I'll never go back, not will i ever suggest them to anyone.",

I     liked it dunked in the yogurt sauce. *-Poori- Indian bread, this was good with the chutney but it was a little crispy for me since I'm used to eating naan. *-Mango Chutney- Sweet and spicy, huge chunks of mango. *-Vegetable Curry- The flavor was perfect, spicy but not too spicy, lots of veggies. *-Extra rice...

The best evidence of how good it is:  My wife and I both had several dishes from the buffet and filled our plates generously after a vigorous gym workout. By the time we finished eating, our plates looked like we had wiped them carefully with those amazing breads I mentioned!

I believe it was $13.99 and was enough for the 2 of us to share after an evening jog. The soup we chose was rassam and the dosai we chose was Chetty Nadu Cauliflower Dosai (crepes fill with onion, cauliflower, tomato & chetti nadu)  The picture I've uploaded was for my half of the crepe.

All Appetizers are served with Chutneys and the Curries are served with Jeera Rice.The Gobi(Cauliflower) Manchurian and Paneer shahi korma (cottage cheese in a creamy gravy) are my favorite picks.If you are new to Indian food go for the lunch buffet and you can pick your own new favorite Indian Vegetarian Dish.  They also have a decent selection of desserts.So what you waiting for.... Go Vegan!(I can't believe i just said that).",

    "text": "I called ahead to inquire about ordering from the menu during the lunch hour. The girl who answered said that if it's not busy they can accommodate this request, but when it's busy, they cannot.  Luckily for me, it was a slow day and they were able to accommodate me.  I wanted to try their Gobi Manchurian and I also inquired if they could make an Aloo Saag (spinach and potatoes) vegan, which is not on the menu.  They agreed to make this dish for me as well. So far, so good with the accommodation factor.  I also added an order of poori (it's a puffy bread) because I cannot resist the leavens.   I inquired if Basmati rice came with the dishes. The girl told me that it came with plain white rice. I again inquired if this was a basmati rice, to which she sharply replied, \"I've never heard of that. We have plain white rice.\"  Really? You work in an INDIAN restaurant and have never heard of one of the most basic and common Indian dishes? What do think they're selling? Uncle Ben's? *breathe*   I arrived and indeed, aside from 1 other table, the place was empty.  I browsed the buffet to see if I was missing anything and I didn't feel that I was.  They have several vegan options, but nothing that looked appetizing. I was so glad that I got to order from the menu.  The girl who took my phone order came up to ring me out.  I took a quick opportunity to look at their menu to see what they called their rice. Well, lookey lookey what we have here - a description of basmati rice. You know I pointed this out, right?  She goes, \"Oh. Well, I've never heard anyone call it that before.\" Oookay. *insert side eye* Then there was the girl who was sweeping the same area of the floor for like 5 minutes. She finished sweeping the rest of her area, which I assumed made her famished (understandably), then she paraded right on over to the buffet and proceeded to fix a plate for herself.  From dirt to food. No washing of the hands, no Germ-x, no nuthin!  Did I mention how happy I was to not be eating from that buffet??  On to the food.  GOBI MANCHURIAN: Battered and deep fried cauliflower doused in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. I requested this dish extra spicy.  It was very yummy.  I wasn't as crisp as I'd hoped, but this could have been due to the fact that it was a carry-out order and it may have gotten soggy from the condensation after being enclosed.  Either way, crisp or limp, it was still a very tasty dish.    ALOO SAAG: I requested it vegan and extra spicy. It was not extra spicy and I questioned if it was very because it had a creamy look to it. I did a taste-test. I didn't taste or smell weird (non-vegan-y); my tummy will let me know if I've been bamboozled.  This dish was just ok. It lacked the sabor with which Aloo Saag is traditionally made, and it was not at all spicy; not even a teeny weenie bit. It wasn't bland, but it was certainly lacking.  Being that this item it not on their menu and they were doing me a favor by making it, I will not hold this against them.  I will just stick to their menu items on any future visits.   POORI: The bread was very fresh and well-prepared.   The portions were large. Prices were reasonable. They have no vegan desserts, but you can find some 2 blocks north at Green.    They lost stars due to the waitress/ cashier's bad attitude and the sanitation concern (c'mon lady!).",

Assorted appetizers had vada, samosa, pakoras served with chutneys and Sambar. Poori bhaji was well done, but I felt the need for a little salt in the bhaji. Paper Dosa was crispy and tasty, but quite big for one person to finish! Overall a very nice evening with good quality South Indian food.",

I walking in and politely asked for the order by name as well as order number to make it easier for them, I also verified the order. I was then given a head nod as the man behind the counter proceeded to check 2 bagged orders and walked away. Not a single word was spoken to me, he continued to walk around the shop, walked past me about 6 times (still not a single word ) and then walked out the door with linens in his arms and over to the laundromat, 24 minutes later and still not a word or an answer about the order. Outraged by the disrespect at this point I walked out and sent in my fiance to retrieve the order. Within 3 minutes he received the order and was in the car. This is absolutely ridiculous. If I EVER get a delivery for this place again I will cancel and everyone I deliver to around this area will be told not to eat here, especially if they are a woman. Thank you for reminding me that some people still have the values and mentality of the 18th century",

The dosi was very good as well and brought out fresh they were the potatoes and onions and was not spicy at all, but good. The only thing that put me off was the styrofoam plates, I hate styrofoam and placing hot food on it becomes toxic. I would prefer they use paper plates, or something different.

I like hot and can handle it but I was planning on feeding it to my son. He got a small taste of it and started crying. Obviously we have two young kids with us, that are going to eat the food. I ordered some bread to hopefully fill up my son, and got my check before the bread. So I told her to forget the bread.

The Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower that puts buffalo wings to shame) is a must. My other favorite are the Dosai's, I've had a few types (spinach, potato & Mysore hot chutney which you should try on the side, it's a very intense slow building sweat but incredible) they're all tasty and come with delicious Sambar lentil soup. I recommend the Assorted Appetizer just for the sauces (pickled chili chutney, tamarind sauce, coconut chutney). I could eat this for every meal, it's literally bliss food! I haven't done the buffet but my brother said it's a trade off, can't take home leftovers but more variety to try. I was surprised most of the dishes have no animal products. More oily and salty than I like to eat but worth it.",

My favorite night out involves Chili Gobi (breaded cauliflower in spicy red sauce) and Chana Batura (saucy chick peas with GIANT puffy bread). So so good. Their buffet is good too but I prefer going for dinner.",

    "text": "Udupi is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot). The Gobi Manchurian (noted by several prior reviewers) and the Chole Peshwari are to die for. I also recommend their Sunday brunch even though it costs more than ordering off their menu. The only downside to Udupi is that it received some bad press for the cleanliness of their kitchen and dining room. I must admit that I saw a cockroach once at Udupi-- but, this was a year ago and they seem to have cleaned up their act. Nonetheless, the food is amazing, well priced, and offers a welcome treat to a veggie-lover's tummy!",

(random i know, but this one time we were there and this cool young couple had a baby and friends at their table and you could just tell they were all very loving people.  -sorry for the woo woo!)  the place smells good, and the food is fresh and authentic.   i love the paper masala dosai--and now i'm craving one before 9am!!",

The Aloo Gobi is perfect and I love their assorted appetizer platter.  Fried goodness!  The staff is very friendly.  I've done the lunch buffet, too, which is fun and great for mixing it up if you find yourself ordering the same thing every time.  Only $8.95!

There is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good, I wish I could remember the name. Everything I have put in my mouth here as been worth telling about. If you don't need meat at every meal like most Americans think they do then try it. I love it when I go into any ethnic restaurant and see more people of that particular ethnicity than your run of the mill American. To me it is a good sign of an authentic food experience.",

    "text": "So, my story is that i wanted to eat dosas, because i love them. I go online and check the places where I can have south indian food...good reviews about Udupi catch my eye ...and I decide lets drive for 25 mins and go to Udupi. My crazy brain started working and I asked my parents to get ready as I wanted to give them a treat with wonderful indian food. We reach this place in Scottsdale, it is a small place, looks like they never took any initiative to make it look good.  My experience started right from entering the door. two guys were standing at the counter, and no one cared to even smile, I thought might be a dental problem( tried to make myself feel comfortable by giving him a benefit of doubt). We were given a table and the spoons did not look very clean to me, and trust me i dun have any kinda OCD. Anyway, I ordered dosas for myself and my mom, and my dad ordered a thalli. My god, the food was BAD. Sambhar was yuck. Trust me guys, I love indian food, I have had good indian food in India and in USA, I can cook indian food as well, and by all the standards the food was bad.  People who have had nicely made dosas and sambhar and other indian food will not like the food at Udupi. I really felt bad for taking my parents to this place. I should have tried this place myself alone first. the guy who took the order for food was NOT someone who would make you feel comfortable, but the guy with beard who served us food was nice.  People at Udupi should teach their employees that a smile does not hurt, and no one will steal their teeth if they do so. and my other suggestion would be plz hire better cooks. For me that was the first and last time at Udhupi, now whenever i strave for a dosa , i think about udupi and my appetite gets killed. I will try more indian food places in AZ and will keep updating my new experiences and finds.",

I went there for a lunch with a couple of friends and was informed rather rudely that they only have a buffet for lunch. This was disappointing since I had my heart set on certain traditional dishes some of which were part of the buffet already. The owner couldn't seem to care less whether we stayed or left and pretty much seemed to give us an ultimatum to either eat the buffet or leave. It being late we decided to try the buffet was sub-par. Barely an item I could think of going back for... In short avoid it if you can. The service makes its not worth it.",

I was in Tempe for a few days, and my vegetarian self always struggles out on the highway, seeking the best experiences I can have, and always fearful of going hungry.   Well, at 9:10pm Friday night, I accidented upon this place, in a goofy strip mall next to a Motel 8, and nervously asked if it was too late to dine since they were closing at 10pm.  The owner was very welcoming and seated us promptly.   The place was a bland sun-drenched pink walled space with a buffet at the back wall.   I didn't have much hope at all.   But when our palak paneer and our Bharwan Baigan Curry showed up, the salivating began.    Perfectly prepared, the eggplant was absolutely delectable.  The spinach and cheese also very delicious.   I couldn't beleive it, this was a definite rival to my fave indian kitchen back home.   I loved it.     We had some leftovers, but no rice to go with it, so the owner gave us free rice so we could have our curries for breakfast in the a.m.   -  a definite must if you like True indian vegetarian food.    Tempe has it's Indian going on.",

    "text": "I ate at Udupi on a Friday night when other vegan restaurants in the area were much too crowded. There was immediate seating here with room to spare in the meticulously clean dining room.  I've heard a lot about Udupi's buffet, but I was here well after buffet hours, so I ordered an appetizer and an entree: vegetable samosas with aloo gobi.  One plus is that #vegan menu items are clearly marked with an asterisk, making ordering quick and easy. However, even some vegan items are served with yogurt on the side, so be sure to avoid that. It was no problem for me, as the chutney and tamarind sauce served with the samosas were tasty when paired with the curry as well.  The samosas were served quickly after ordering and were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were amazing, but I would order them again.  The aloo gobi was fantastic. The cauliflower was perfectly tender and not over-cooked as is easy to do. The ratio of vegetables to curry was great--more than enough substance in this vegan entree for my stomach. My only regret is ordering it with a medium spice. Mild probably would have been perfect.  Service was quick, friendly, and attentive without being invasive. Even the restrooms were surprisingly well-maintained.  I would recommend Udupi to anyone looking for a clean dining experience and a craving for Indian food. Their vegan offerings are numerous and I can't wait to try the lunch buffet.",

It's really hit the spot every time, so much so that it's a contender for our favorite Indian buffet in the Valley. They don't have the biggest spread, and the offerings have varied a bit each time we've been (I wish they'd give out a calendar listing Gobi Manchurian days in advance), but I've yet to try anything I don't like there.  Something I like about Udupi, but others might dislike, is that it's a little bit different every time. It's seemed to me like the spice level and flavor profiles have varied subtly each time I've eaten here - just enough to keep it interesting, and always within the bounds of \"really good\".   As a meat-lover who's dabbled in vegetarianism and veganism, I've never thought, \"I wish this meal had some meat,\" while eating at Udupi Cafe. And that's certainly enough to keep me coming back from time to time.",

Sometimes you'll look through a menu dominated by meat dishes for one or two items that are all starch and grease.  At Udupi, you have an all-vegetarian menu with a TON of vegan options.  Delicious.  If you order something with batura, you're going to get a MASSIVE poof of bread brought to your table with your entree that will definitely leave you with leftovers.  Want another kind of bread?  That's a naan issue--they have MANY different flavors and varieties of naan to choose from.  Take your pick.  At some point in the past, a number of Yelp reviewers made complaints about the cleanliness of this place.  Those days are apparently quite long gone.  Everything was clean as a whistle and service with fast and smiling.  You even get a special copy of the Coffee News with your meal.  This is another spot to put on your list of \"must go\" vegetarian joints in the Valley.  I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy it.",

    "text": "A tasty buffet that serves vegetarian and vegan dishes, Udupi offers a great variety of curries, starches, and desserts that will please anyone that doesn't need to have meat at every meal.  For me, usually I enjoy the veggie dishes at Indian restaurants more than the meaty ones anyways, so I didn't mind not eating meat for my lunch.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, and found a mix of various northern and southern Indian dishes.  Some buffet items included vadai, palak paneer, sauteed green beans (Sorry, forgot the name!), and veggie korma.  There was also a cold foods station with salads, yogurt, and sauces.  For breads, they offered papadum, paratha, and they make fresh dosa and bring it to your table.  I tried a little bit of each buffet hot item, and enjoyed each dish.  The dosa was light and crispy, with a nice curried potato filling.  For desserts, they had ras malai, carrot halwa, and coconut burfi.  I enjoyed each dessert, especially the ras malai, which is a sweetened creamy paneer.  It was my first time trying it, and it was delicious.  They also had a thermos with cardamom-infused chai tea, with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested.    The price is expensive considering that this is only a vegetarian/vegan buffet (About 11 to 12 dollars per person for the weekend buffet, sodas and iced tea extra), but there is a lot of variety to try to make up for it.  Service was cheerful and friendly, and we got a card for 10% off our next visit after paying for our check.  Maybe we will check out the less expensive weekday buffet to see how the non-weekend buffet measures up!",

I do not think I have ever ate so much in my life. Keep in mind there is NO MEAT at this restaurant.  Service: The service was not all that great I must say, but since the food was so good I just had to give them a 5 star rating. The menu is extremely difficult to understand (and has no picture). If its your first time I highly recommend using the photos on yelp to assist you in ordering because the waitress was not very helpful.   Location: The location is in a small strip mall and is nothing special. There is a good amount of seating and its generally nice and quite.",

I decided to go during the week for lunch buffet so I could try an assortment of different things. It was just Ok, actually I was a bit disappointed but I'll give them another try soon. First, it was not that busy but I arrived after the lunch rush. There were not as many buffet items as I expected. I've been to several Indian buffets in the past and it always seemed like the choices were endless. Basically Udupi had  2 types of rice (1 being plain white rice), 2 soups, a spinach entree, lentil, eggplant and potato entree and 2 desserts (the desserts were AMAZING!) also a salad area but who really wants salad with indian? For $9/lunch it's not a bad price. I will say the taste of the food was very good, but I would've gladly paid a bit more for having more options. Service was somewhat inattentive even though it was pretty quiet. Example: I got my own water a few times and had to ask for napkins. I will say the dessert was amazing! The best Gulab Jamun I've had anywhere, the Rasgulla was also quite delicious. I'd never had that before and it was lovely. I will go back again maybe on a weekend as I hear they have more options then.",

I came here after a good run with some friends that were vegetarians.  Needless to say, as I opened the menu it was foreign to me.  I didn't even know where to start or order, but trusted the waitress on what she recommended along with some neighboring patrons.    We started with the South Indian Thali; a plethora of curry, chutney, and yogurts.  I'm not even going to try to pronounce or put the names down cause that point is rather moot unless you eat Indian food religiously!  The ingredients were in small custards surrounding some rice and a tortilla-like chip.  We also ordered some Poori and fluffy fried bread which went well with some of the curry and chutney mixes from the first dish.  We then proceeded with a fried pancake-like bread with some coconut shredding.  It definitely had a hint of coconut taste, but the three sauces that came along with it made my palates pop; spicy and sweet you pick!  Our final dish we ordered was a rice dish called the Bisi Bele Bath; probably my favorite of the night.  It was a was a semi-porridge rice entree served with lentils, peanuts, and vegetables.  Overall, it was subtle, but had a minor hint of curry taste.  The nuts gave it a welcoming texture to every bite.  In the end, Udupi deliveries unique experience of traditional Indian food that even a non-vegetarian would appreciate.  I can never flat out name the dishes that we had and do it justice, but the only way I can say is go for it! - Enjoy!",

Everything looked like it was going to be amazing but really it ended up being lack luster. We've had the Gobi Manchurian before it festivals like vegan and Indian get togethers. So we knew the food was good. The guy did little to talk to us. There was so little communication going on. So he says he'll repeat our order back to us, and it was corrects. All right. The food came out in a strange slew of appetizers and entres. I was really confused when my MIL did not get her dosai. I got my vadu and was saddened. It was only one. What? One! I dunked it and yes, the food is amazing but the delivery was horrible. We ordered two Manchurian's because why not? We made it clear it was vegan. He says yes vegan and then brings us cow pus yogurt. Why? When I asked for something different he looked at the table and saw we had tamarind and told me to just eat that. I was pretty shocked. Our server only speared twice. Considering how empty the place was we felt very lonely and wondered why we weren't being served well. I mean clearly we should stick to just ordering food from your venues. You don't seem to want to run a restaurant. There was a big sign saying out of order on some soft serve machine. Very tacky. The restrooms were horribly designed with a paper towel dispenser on the back of the door. Try not get smacked in the face when drying your hands! After getting a dish that had some orange maybe cashew cream on the underside of a plate brought out I was like is it worth it to drink from the glass or should I pollute the oceans with the supplied straws?  Honestly I'd have to be dragged to go back. I'll see you at the venues though! Amazing food.",

    "text": "I have been to a few Indian restaurants in the area, and have been at least mildly disappointed with them(dirty, bad food, poor service etc). This was my first visit to Udupi, which I have been wanting to try for some time since I am interested in vegetarian and ethnic food. I initially drove right past the place since it's easier to see the sign going south than north. The dining room was clean, well lit, and smelled nice. The waitress(who was very nice and understanding that I didn't want to butcher the food names) talked me into the fresh lemon drink(like a bubbly lemonade) which was really good. I ended up getting the Medhu Vada (lentil donuts) and the Palak Paneer (Spinich with soft cheese cubes). It came with basmati rice and some sort of cream sauce on the side. The donuts are dense, so I'd advise on not slamming them like I did. The palak paneer was wonderful. Great portion size and plenty of paneer cubes(I once when to an Indian place that had maybe 4-5 small cubes in the whole dish). I wanted to get dessert (even though I was so full), but other people in my party weren't interested(Full too!).            The one thing I didn't like about the place was the menu. I am not that familiar with Indian food, but I am very open minded about trying new things. The menu assumes you know what foreign words mean and what to expect from the dish. I would put a glossary in the back and maybe some pictures.            In closing, I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to everyone interested in Indian food, including vegetarians.",

I had dinner plans with an out-of-town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for Indian. The stars aligned and we ended up here.   I started out with a hot black tea and Mixed Vegetable Pakora as our appetizer. The deep fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces; one reminded me of A-1 sauce with a little sweet tang.   The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items. He even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of.   We opted to go with the Batura bread, which happens to be a giant deep fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla. It actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table.   As an entree we went with my personal fav, Mutter Paneer, which was EXCELLENT, and Udupi Special Spring Dosai... basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things. They were good, but not great.   Our food came out quickly, the service was attentive, the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste, portions and quality of our dishes.   I will be back to Udupi for sure, this place is amazing!",

    "text": "Thanks to an episode of \"Roker on the Road,\" I had a craving for dosa.  After a day of going back and forth of \"Udupi Cafe or Taj Mahal?,\" I decided on giving Udupi Cafe another try.    After poring over the dosa menu, I finally decided on the Udupi Special spring dosa, a version I haven't tried here before.  I asked my servers if the dosa and the chutneys were free of certain allergenic ingredients and was told, with authority I might add, that the dosa was OK and while two of three chutneys [coconut and jalapeno-cilantro (?)] were off-limits, the sambar is good-to-go.  (He even pointed out an allergen ingredient in the coconut chutney.)  The A-OK signal on the sambar surprised me greatly, as out of the three choices, it was the first item I'd have balked at trying (I've tried it at many other restaurants and was told that the recipe calls for a few allergens).  My server did offer to bring tamarind sauce to replace the other two chutneys.  Since I was almost salivating at the sight of the dosa and the server was pretty confident in his knowledge of chutney ingredients, I dove my spoon into the sambar and came up with a lovely and flavorful chunk of potato and a bit of broth.  Yum!  I went in again, this time swirling a bit to make sure there weren't any allergens hiding in the murky depths when I spotted *!  As if on cue, my server AND the host approach my table to tell me that I should not eat the sambar nor the dosa since they contained allergens.  Argh!  So, away went my Udupi special spring dosa, away went the sambar, and I was back to square one as to what to order, although this time I knew I had a few hours of pain and nausea to look forward to (which started to rear their ugly heads as I was signing my credit card receipt).  At this point, the host was steering me away from the dosa menu since I'd have to stay away from all that contained any filling (apparently, the kitchen staff could not whip up a filling that omitted the one ingredient that kept me from having it).  Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be such a terrible thing as there are many other dosa options that would then be complemented with chutneys, but since the three chutneys also contained an ingredient I couldn't have (again, the chef would not be able to make the sauces omitting the ingredient- the host explained that the chutneys were made in huge batches earlier in the day), dosa from Udupi Cafe is off-limits for me :(  I decided, then, to have the assorted appetizer platter.  This would've only been accompanied by tamarind sauce had I not asked for a second option, plain yogurt, as suggested by the host.  \"Plain yogurt?,\" I asked.  \"Could you add something else to flavor the yogurt?\"  \"Carrots.  Is carrots OK?,\" the host posited.  \"Yes, carrots are alright,\" I said.    The three items I savored in the app platter were cauliflower pakora, the samosa, and the veggie cutlet^.  I wasn't a fan of the dense mysore bonda (various fillings of potato, eggplant, and jalapeno) nor the bready medhu vada (fried lentil donuts), although the latter was quite good dipped in tamarind sauce AND yogurt.  In retrospect, I did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep-fried :(  In light of the disinclination of Udupi Cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes- which leads me to believe that most items are already pre-made and later plated (if you read my other reviews, you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out/sub sauces, sometimes PIQUED at the chance to come up with a new sauce on-the-fly) and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney, I doubt I'll keep UC at the top of my choices next time I have a taste for Indian cuisine.  So many fish in the sea...    I wish UC and its management and staff well in providing vegetarians and omnivores alike the opportunity to enjoy a menu offering up 100% veggie fare.  Do try the Gobi Manchurian- very tasty!  ^[At least the meal wasn't a total loss- I did get to capture some captivating eye candy!  How I wish I had a close-up on that veggie cutlet, and that samosa... 8-)]",

He took me to what he said was the best and most authentic Indian food in the country. Udupi is better!!  The environment leaves much to be desired,  but the food is amazing. A must have is the Paper Dosai Masala. It's a HUGE crispy crepe that has a filling (the masala has a potato filling) and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in. The presentation is as wonderful as the flavor. As evidence, the last time I ordered it, the tables on either side of us asked what it was!  The pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner. I have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so I'm not sure how it compares.   All in all, if you're looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!",

Man says yes and $10, I said sure set me up.  Hands me a styrofoam container, and I asked him I can put whatever I want, he said yes.    Went to the line, and what a disappointment, the only thing that looked appetizing was vegetable biryani and idli.  So I put a little bit of rice and took 5 idlis...plates only half full.  I asked if they would bring out some more idli.  They said yes.  Shortly they brought out some more to restock the buffet.  I grabbed 5 more...now my plate is full.  And I am on my way right?  Wrong! the manager or owner stops me and says I'm sorry but I'm going to have to charge you extra for the idlis.  I'm baffled...he explains that buffet takeout is for a variety only and not just one thing.  I'm baffled...I ask him so if I dine in, and I take a plate of only one thing and maybe the second time I get the same thing you would charge me twice?  He says no, that's dine in though.  I'm baffled at the logic here...so I went along and says what are you going to charge me...he says $9...i'm baffled $19 for 1 plate of vegetarian food!  I can understand a premium steak but rice cakes (idlis)...unreal.  I was tempted to just leave the plate there and show him the bird, but I already commited to $10 already...and I was in a hurry and starving...so I bit the bullet and paid $9 more.  NEVER again will I give this place my business...and the food wasn't even that good...it's rice cakes for god sake.",

It isn't terrible, especially if you're a vegetarian (or vegan as they have some vegan dishes) and want to comfortably be able to eat without worrying about meat. The selection isn't expansive and the place isn't necessarily upscale, but the service is good. It's good to try at least once, especially if you love Indian food and want to try a different side of it free of goat or chicken.  Food-wise, you've got your typical variations of dals and lentils in different cream sauces. Your basmati rice, and your dessert table of milk cake and rice pudding.   I'm sorry there isn't much of anything else to say. Some other places I'd recommend over Udupi for typical, delicious, and cheaper Indian food would have to be Jewel of the Crown in Old Town Scottsdale and Delhi Palace on ASU Campus.",

I am pretty sure I would not go back.  1. Rava dosa tasted extremely salty after it wasn't hot anymore and it drips oil! 2. Rasam did not taste like rasam. It was just mildly flavored water. 3. The raita served with Vegetable Biriyani was way too sour. 4. Vada was neither crispy on the outside nor soft on the inside. It was hard to fully eat even one. The chutney absolutely didn't taste fresh.  The Chaat Papri was the only saving grace.",

You can choose between vada and idli and variety of dosas. The idli was well done and soft but the sambar was mind blowing. It reminded me about Bangalore and my compliments to the chef who got the flavor and taste spot on. The soup was mulligatawny which tasted average. Then came the long wait for the uthapam. I had asked for well done and this generally takes time but considering that my initial order was almost half hour back, the wait was too long for me and I packed it to go. The endless wait was really irritating especially since I had a flight to catch. The taste of the uthapam was a different story altogether. It was well roasted to golden brown and coupled with peanut and coconut chutney, it was amongst the better uthapam I have had in Bangalore. The chef would give Sarvana Bhavan a run for their money. The decor was kinda dreary. The wall paintings seemed to give a hint of warmth but the white walls, thermocol roof and red chairs gave a very dreary look. All in all best sambar and uthapam in a long time.",

I typically do not dock stars for the last two characteristics if the food is good, so I knew I had to give it a second chance before making up my mind. I'm very glad I did, because I had a terrific experience. Not terrific enough to give it more stars but enough to commit to being a returning customer.  The vegan options are terrific. Every dish I've eaten has had that \"comfort food\" quality I personally look for in Indian cuisine. I've tried a couple of times to engage the servers in providing a recommendation, but they were hesistant to elaborate with any dinner advice. Which is ok, I can make up my mind without regretting my choice. And our server/host this last time was extremely friendly and accommodating.  When I entered at 7pm there was only one other soul dipping some dosa in raita; it made me a little nervous to see the lack of customers. By the time I left at 8:30, the place was full. A very good, reassuring sign. For having been vegan in AZ for 3 years, I'm surprised I haven't been here more often. I was a little put off by the plain set up and lack of personality upon my first visit, but I am decidedly over it.",

So many items to choose from on the menu and all spiced more authentically than more mild/bland (relatively) buffet offerings.  Definitely get one of their Dosa/Dosai (we shared one among 3 of us) and if you are a vampire don't order the Garlic Paratha, garlic lovers and those looking to boost their immunity will appreciate the generous amount of garlic.   Don't let the fact that it is vegetarian scare you, believe me you won't be missing the meat with all the great flavors and textures.",

My other friend raves about this place. I think I'll have to check it out during dinner menu so I can have a better opinion of the place. I did however like one of the spinach items on the buffet list. I think if there was one curry dish when I went, I would've loved it. This is also not a place to eat if you're a meat lover.",

Good variety of breakfast items - The pongal was amazing..Idly, Dosai were just the usual. The sambar was just OK (they should improve considering it is the primary side for b'fast)..The gobi manchuria was amazing..The lunch items were OK (one snack, paratha, 2 entrees & veg biryani). Decent variety of desserts (the gulab jamun was perfect & this is another place that serves it hot)..Ordered Mango Lassi on the side & it was amazing!   Final Verdict: I would visit this place again, provided, they improve their sambar!",

    "text": "The fact that their coffee drink \"with cream\" and their tea with milk are labeled as vegan make me wonder if they really know what vegan means or if their \"vegan\" dishes also have ghee or some other dairy in them.   My main complaint is the service. When we asked our server what he recommended as far as vegan food, he replied that he didn't know because he hadn't eaten there in three months....and then he recommended a dish with cottage cheese in it.    In addition, he told us it's BYOB and that we could bring wine because they probably have a corkscrew. He saw one in the kitchen three months ago...uh ok. Later we were asked if we needed anything \"since you're the only two people here.\" He was definitely trying, so that's something I guess.   The food was spicy, but pretty good overall. The servings are large (2-3 meals worth, for me).  My vegan dish was served with a yogurt sauce (not vegan). My husband had the fried cauliflower dish and liked it enough but doesn't have any desire to return.   It might be better to go to the lunch buffet so you can figure out what you like. There are minimal descriptions on the menu and the servers (since the first hadn't eaten there he called over a second server) were unable to answer questions such as \"what does this word mean?\", \"is this deep fried?\", \"is this spicy?\", etc.  We might give it another chance and try the lunch buffet, since it's so close to our place. Probably not though.",

They will offer a pancake that is made out of rice and wrapped with potatoes inside laced with Indian spices from Punjab.  I also got myself a Mango Lassi (Mango blended yogurt) that complimented these dishes well.  I have always being wowed by the Indian's way of meal preparation where they can make the food taste different every single meal and this place can definitely illustrate and give you a glimpse of what can be done with your vegetables.

So thank gosh for Udupi Cafe, a tasty Tempe spot that just so happens to be less than a mile away from the all-vegan Green.  Udupi serves a wide variety of Indian food that, unless you're familiar with the type of cuisine, will require some translation help when ordering.  Be warned: the portions here are huge, which rocks, considering the dirt cheap prices.  I got the Sambar Vada, which are fried lentil donuts you can dip in a spicy sauce. I also got Paneer Pakora, fried cheese, and Poori, big, fluffy bread.  Go here for the food. The ambiance is simple, and the tables aren't exactly the comfiest. The service is also lacking (last night, like many times, I waited more than 10 minutes for a soda refill.)  But Udupi hits the spot for a satisfying, healthy, ethnic meal.",

It's cafeteria style so you get to taste whatever you want and it's is labeled vegan or non-vegan.  I absolutely loved the vegetable green curry!!!  I've been craving it ever since.  Woodlands Vegetarian South Indian food is closer to home so we went there yesterday.  BIG mistake, HUGE mistake!  Same price, but the service, ambiance, and food is night and day.

And gulab jamuns were not too good. Pista kulfi was nothing like a pista kulfi. There was this server who had a bad cold and was blowing up his nose in front of the guest and did not even bother to wash his hands. Very unhygienic. This was my first and last visit to this place.

Like I'm there! we always get the mango juice because it's the best than anywhere else! Samosas are perfect! Fried everything is! The okra is TO DIE FOR!!!

I choose Indian food over Ethiopian any day of the week so Udupi was the choice to explore and also if you want northern Indian flavors. Located in a strip mall in South Scottsdale, it's not a place that stands out or calls to you.  Once you step inside, the food will do all the talking. Staff is sweet and knowledgeable if you aren't sure what to order. I came for dinner and my top choices are the mixed vegetable pakora, paper dosai, gobi manchurian and the vegetable briyani. Servings are ridiculously generous that you end up with leftovers for everyone. The dosa is lightly-fried bread (think of it as a crepe on steroids) that has the perfect crunch. The order comes with 3 sauces that are just lovely accompaniments for flavor. The pakora is equivalent to fried tempura and I love that they include jalapenos. My ultimate favorite is the briyani bursting with so much flavor. I took the leftovers home and added steak and sriracha to fill my big girl appetite. If you have room, finish off with a cup of chai and the madras special payasam (kheer). Rasmalai is another wonderful choice for dessert. How do you go wrong with homemade cottage cheese balls dipped in condensed milk and rose water?!!!   Overall, it is inexpensive dining for good food. I would come back and try the lunch buffet, malasa, and paneer despite lacking the meat component. For a sliver of bites, I almost thought I could go vegeterian with these kinds of niblets. Then recalled they don't serve alcohol and my wanton carnivore ways came back to light.",

After reading the menu for entirely too long, I went with the vegan vindaloo.  So good!  Spicy for sure ... True testament to how my taste buds have changed and adapted these years living in Arizona.  I don't think my previous midwest palate would have handled that spice. ;-)   This is a great spot for vegetarians, as everything on the menu is meat-free.  Many dishes can also be made vegan, yay!  I loved the vindaloo... All the veggies and potatoes with that fluffy jasmine rice.  I had enough food for two more meals!   I also had a cup of the rasam soup, which is described as hot and sour.  I really liked it.  It was light and brothy with veggies, definitely tangy and good spice.  Prices are fair, food is good, service is prompt.",

Vada in the sambar too hard, sambar good though, cutlet was another disaster... The biryani was mild and home style, we all liked it, the sambar sadham was good too...

Asked for roti from the white girl and she said the cook doesn't like me and there is no roti ready. We asked the owner and he brought it out at 2:40, 30 minutes after we asked for it.  The worst was...that people were still eating at 2:40 PM and...they started mopping the floor.  Overall worst experience I've ever had at a Buffett. Will NEVER come back again.

It is probably owned by a North Indian family who do not have an understanding of the tastes of South India and neither does the chef. South Indian restaurants are evaluated on their Idli, Dosa and sambar. None of those here were worth a mention. Idli was all dried up, Masala dosa had mashed potato for the masala, Sambar had only a few tiny chopped vegetables. The green beans curry which is a staple in any South Indian restaurant was pathetic and cheapened by loads of onions. Service was ok. The owner/manager welcomed as soon as I entered, while the young lady who was supposed to play hostess was busy flirting with a waiter. The staff was friendly, but the young lady was missing in action again when it came time to pay the check. Had to wait for the princess to show up. Sorry, please do not expect me to go there again!",

Checked out Udupi today and was really pleased - granted I'm a white person from the Midwest so I can't speak to what \"real\" Udupi food tastes like, but I like South Indian food and I liked the food here.   In particular one negative review mentions the restaurant and bathrooms being dirty - this wasn't remotely my experience. The whole building seemed well cleaned and kept up.   Also feel like I've seen a pattern of criticism of restaurants in this area of people being upset that their service was merely attentive rather than... I don't know, fawning? All I want out of a service interaction is for it to be reasonably prompt, polite, and accurate re: the price I'm charged. I got that here.  ETA: I remembered the one thing I didn't really like, which is that I got a diet coke but it was kind of warm and flat - my guess is that it came from a can or something instead of a soda fountain. The spice level of the food made me only want to drink (a lot of) water anyway so it won't affect any future dining decisions but that was the one drawback.",

Batura: Having only previously tried naan and dosas, I have to admit my knowledge of Indian breads was severely limited, but thankfully my eyes have been opened here. This mouthwatering, lightly-fried bread is soft, fluffy, and a fantastic side to accompany curries and other entrees. 2. Aloo gobi: A dish like this will leave you wondering if going vegetarian could be possible after all. The cauliflower is flavorful and not overly mushy, and they also throw in mushrooms for some extra variety. 3. Lassis: Great selection here, ranging from classic mango to rose to even salt if you're trying to cut down on sugar. For anyone like me who loves Indian food but lacks the necessary spice tolerance, these drinks are lifesavers.",

If you've never had it, it's pretty different from North Indian food - the spices are more potent and it's vegetarian (as if the name didn't give it away).  It's located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking. There's a lot of seating inside and the staff is really nice. A good starting menu item is the masala dosai - a large, thin rice crepe stuffed with potatoes. Personally, I thought the potatoes were a little bland, but it was still pretty good.  Another good starting item is the vegetable utthapam. I thought Udupi's was really good. It looks like a large pancake covered with a variety of vegetables served with different chutneys on the side. Really yummy.  The channa batura is chick peas served with a large piece of delicious fried bread. Very nice. Often times the chick peas are mushy and overspiced, but these were really good. I had the kedhai bendhi, which is spicy okra with rice. The flavor of the actual okra was good, but it's obvious that the okra was a few days old and dried out (especially compared to the fresh slices of onion and bell pepper cooked along side the okra). Rice seemed reheated, too.  Overall, not the best South Indian food I've had, but some good solid dishes I would be happy to come back and eat.",

This being Southern Indian cuisine, the options were uniquely different from the Indian fare I am used to, and I was especially thrilled about the prevalence of coconut in the dishes.  The culinary journey through Southern India began with a Vada, a  donut-like fritter made with lentils.  Dipped in the spicy tomato chutney or coconut chutney, it was delectable!  Next came the Rajma Aloo, a flavorful potato dish with beans.  The Daal Curry, made of lentils peas and beans and flavored with cumin and other Indian spices was outstanding with the basmati rice.  The highlight  was definitely the Shai Paneer with a coconut cream sauce.  The paneer, so traditional to Southern Indian cuisine, has a texture and taste like that of tofu.  The difference is that it is cheese, made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegar.  Even the Kheer, rice pudding cooked with milk and honey, garnished with raisins and almonds, was heavenly.  With an endless supply of Dosai, thin crepe-like bread that you can use for scooping your food or rolling your dishes into, it was a excellent lunch buffet for roughly $10/person.  I will definitely be coming back here for dinner, and introducing my vegetarian friends to this delightful establishment.",

We've ordered so many different south Indian spices, dals, curry leaves, and cooking supplies (tawa, electric stone grinder for dosa batter, idli steamer etc) that Amazon seems to think we live in India, which is awesome, as we just keep finding more stuff to try.  Udupi has opened up a whole new cuisine to us, and we can't get enough of it!    Don't think of Udupi as a vegetarian restaurant.  Yes, the food is strict vegetarian, but that is the way south Indian food is prepared.  Since most veg restaurants aren't very good, if you think about Udupi this way, you'll miss out trying this cuisine, which is truly sad.    To the Udupi staff - keep doing what you do!  It was a complete fluke that we found you... we were looking for another veg restaurant up the street, which happened to be closed and we stumbled in.  Now south Indian food is a big part of our lives.  BTW - we've been chasing the perfect home-made dosa for a long time, and can't seem to master the art (but getting better.)  If you want two sous chefs to work for free on the weekends in exchange for some dosa tips, we're totally up for it!",

    "text": "We initially ordered masala dosai, medhu vada and idly. The sambhar in these dishes was ok; chutney was good. Medhu vada and dosai came out really well but idly was not liked by my partner. My partner and I are Indian and she felt she could make much better ones with lot less rawa than that was used in udupi's idly. Here came the bad part midway through our dinner-- seems their coffee filter machine was broken the time we visited them. But that did not stop the waiter / manager-looking guy with a beard from taking the second leg of our order for a mysore \"filter\" coffee ( as advertised). Well, right after that I had the need to confirm if they were gonna give me a coffee in traditional mysore/south karnataka style. Halfway through my enquiry, the same guy interrupts me rather rudely (his exactly reply in the form of a question was \"what do you mean by traditional?\"), later explaining that the filter coffee  cant be made in traditional  style cause their coffee filter machine was broken and hey! he was not sorry about it. Not sorry for almost selling me a different product than i asked for and not sorry for interrupting me! I am not sure if he thought I was making a very special accommodation request when i ordered something from the menu. If he thought so, he would be very wrong about it. Consequently, he lost the business he could have had with us for the rest of the evening. We were going to order much more before this guy spoilt our dinner atmosphere-- our bill could have easily been double and we would have also left the place with twice the satisfaction (and twice the number of stars for them).  Not all service was bad-- there was a girl who waited on us properly and took our initial orders of masala dosai, idly and medhu vada. We left a reasonable tip and we dearly hope all of it reaches the girl.",

It's all vegetarian and vegan, which I love.  Couldn't taste any cumin so I liked that.  Not all the dishes were healthy though lol.  Remember, just because it's vegetarian, and esp vegan, doesn't mean it's all healthy.  It all depends on what ingredients were use.  I tried a little of everything and went back for a little more.  Staff is courteous.  $10 for all you can eat lunch.  Can't beat that.",

    "text": "This restaurant is awesome! I'm so glad to find a vegan friendly Indian food place nearby! I was a little leary of Indian food again after having mishaps at the last two Indian restaurants I went to (one Northern and one Southern Veg too)-  Once with ghee and once with milk added in by mistake (or disregarded - not quite sure). I went for dinner but was happy to see there was a buffet for lunch time. Indian Vegan buffet sounds way too good to be True! - I'll have to come back and update on that. For dinner today though, I ordered Samosas and a Dosai (rice and lentil crepe) with potatoes and onions and chutney. My mom ordered Vegetable Biriyani. I let them know I don't eat dairy or Ghee at all and to make sure to exclude it. The food was soo good! They gave me 3 different sauces that made it so yummy to have a differnt flavor every bite. My mom ate a bunch of mine too because it was a MASSIVE crepe! Highly recommend! My moms biriyani was so good too! Perfectly spiced. I took home her left overs and ate them all later that night too! - My mom and I also ordered tea while we were there- mine black and hers Indian. The manager (I believe) came by to let me know personally that the Indian tea had milk in it-, in case I had missed that on the menu and ordered it. I was so pleasantly surprised that he knew about my request for VEGAN and not only seemed very familiar with what Vegan meant, but had my back to make sure I didn't accidentally order something with dairy in it. How Awesome! I felt really safe to eat there after that knowing I wasn't going to wind up sick again. Major points! You don't find that kind of service in most standard American restaurants nowadays- and it can be even harder at ethnic ones. Kudos to them! I highly recommend this place to everyone! Huge portion sizes, super affordable and soooo delicious - this will be one of my staple places to eat out at for sure!  ** Only thing they are missing is some vegan deserts. Someone's gotta tell them about Coconut/Soy Ice Cream and non-dairy/nut mylk (milk).**  Check them out! **Great Prices, Great Food, Great Service!** You won't be disappointed!",

Sambhar and chutneys were good. We also had bisibele bath, it was okay, but I have had really delicious and more authentic ones in chandler. The food presentation was very appealing though.  We also had aloo paratha which was also nothing special.   We came here with very high expectations of authentic south indian tastes and flavors based on yelp reviews and hence the dissappointment.

I didn't recognize any of the staff, but the restaurant's decor was the same. I'm guessing it's changed ownership since I was last there years ago?  One improvement is that every item on the buffett is clearly marked as vegan or not. They also had new little dishes for the chutneys (very handy!) and the papaddum was fresh. And they had plenty of napkins available (a prior issue given my love of spice)!  For the main buffet area, they had the usual veggie soup and rice, but also had excellent \"hush puppies\" (my simplest comparison) - little fried veggie balls with what I believe is chickpea flour. I engulfed them. The soup was good too - not too spicy but very fresh tasting.  Much to my delight, the buffet had both of my favorites - chana masala and Dal. Other vegan items included coconut-coated green beans, an eggplant curry dish and veggie Manchurian (more/different veggie balls but in a sauce). All was great, but the chana masala stood out the most to me. The flavor had lots of nuance - a bit savory with a cinnamon-like flavor, but nicely heated/spiced. They also had a vegan flat bread, which is great for sopping up the curry sauce.  The buffet also still comes with a dosa (rolled crepe stuffed with potatoes and other veggies). This was a little less exciting. It was fairly small and only lightly stuffed in the center. I probably could have asked for another, but considering it's six hours later and I'm still stuffed, it was all I needed.   One other major improvement - they kept the ice water flowing. I used to have to beg for water (and it usually only had a cube or two of ice). I'm glad to see Udupi is back on my \"go to\" list. I will definitely be back!",

People were still dining in and other came after me as well, so it was pretty chill. I approached an employee and let him know I wanted to order takeout. I perused the menu while he helped others pick up their orders and chose to get samosas and gobi manchurian, been craving that dish for a while. He was nice, commented to me \"oh, you know what you want\"; Yup, I have my favorites and I do know what I want.   Took about 10 minutes or so and I got my food. My items were packaged neatly and I found out at home that they gave me a container of rice as extra, cool. I tried a few pieces of the fried cauliflower, oh so good. It really does remind me of vegetarian orange chicken, and the spice level on it is real nice. I didn't get to eat the rest until the next day, along with the samosa, but both were delicious  reheated and I love the array of sauces: spicy mint chutney, sweet tamarind, and mild raita (yogurt).

We were a group of 7 and it was open on a Labor Day Monday which worked out perfectly for us. We didn't opt for the buffet, we were in mood for some South Indian breakfast so we jumped right in and ordered a bunch of items from the menu. Sambar was a major disappointment! Good South Indian food as there aren't many places like these serving Udupi breakfast in the US.  Must Try: Idli Manchurian  Onion and Chilli Uttapam  Gajar ka Halwa with Vanilla Ice Cream",

The variety of vegetarian and vegan is unmatched, fully equipped with idli, sambar, biryani, vegetable sabjis, usually some manchurian option, roti, and so much more! Plus the desserts, usually gulab jamun or kheer are on point too. Just don't bring any carnivores here, they won't like it.  It's critical that you ask for dosas to be delivered to your table as well. It's a part of the buffet and they make these fresh.   Chai is on the side, just make sure to add sugar if you want! The only thing I haven't liked at Udupi was their mango lassi, which is a bit too sour for my taste.",

I am a vegetarian, however, I think even meat lovers will enjoy the flavorful dishes prepared here. In addition, the prices are comparatively less expensive, but of equal or greater quality. The portions are generous. I don't think I should recommend certain items because everyone has his or her own tastes. Everything I ordered was outstanding. I highly recommend Udupi, and will be ordering again and again.",

This place is a typical example of how Indian restaurant owners in the US brutally take their Indian customers for granted; as compared to their non-Indian customers who are treated like \"Gods\". Here is how:  1) When my parents and I entered the restaurant, the waiter literally waved at us from some distance asking us to find a place. While we were still looking around, he walked to one non-Indian couple behind us and escorted them to the seat of their choice.   2) While the same couple was served with extra spoons and dishes, I was blatantly and rudely asked by one of the waiters to keep using my used spoon and fork for my second order as well.   3) I ordered Masala Dosa. The same waiter ridiculously ended up serving me Sada Dosa, even after confirming with me that I had ordered Masala Dosa. When I told the other waiter about this, he literally lifted my Dosa with his hands to check if there was Masala added or not. When he realized that I was not lying, he very casually told that the cook probably forgot to add the masala. I am sure, he would not have dared to do the same with any of his non-Indian customers.   In a nutshell, the food was okay. However, the service was rude, unprofessional, and uncivilized. Probably if Indian customers went there with their face painted white, they may receive better service? - Pathetic.",

It received five stars and one dollar sign and I thought, what have I got to lose?  Since that first time I've brought so many friends here and everyone has loved it.   Just this fall I brought Sarah H when she was on maternity leave. We've always loved going to Indian food and Udupi is a little different than the typical being southern, but equally delicious, and she loved it too. We enjoyed the lunch buffet and added on the spicy cauliflower (can't remember the name for the life of me). Unfortunately, they didn't make the cauliflower very spicy that day, maybe they thought we couldn't take it, but it was good.   Just writing about it my mouth is watering. If you haven't tried Udupi and you like Indian food, you really need to go.",

Being utterly disappointed, I made my way back to the buffet hoping to God that there's better tasting food. Exact same thing again.. not a single thing in the entire spread that was worth eating. We decided to wait for the dosas instead of filling up on the dreadful food. Unfortunately, they were worse than the stuff from the buffet. How it is possible to put out such appalling food without a single redeemable dish is beyond me! What a colossal waste of time.. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",

Get the puffy bread and the Mandarin Cauliflower(Iknow it sounds off but its insanely good). Highly recommended!",

While most people would associate Indian food with lamb biryani and chicken tikka masala, Udupi's cuisine is a vegan person's ethnic paradise. I am definitely a fan of their Uthappam and just about anything on the menu that has potatoes in them. Any of their dosais are winners, but I do love the masala dosai a whole lot! Be adventurous and try a little of everything! This food gets mighty spicy though-- your taste buds will definitely be put to the test. Ample free parking and a great, friendly staff. My only gripe is that they're closed on Tuesdays.",

All of the food needed to be vegetarian, I'm not vegetarian...had no clue where to get good food and fast.  Found great reviews on Yelp so I gave Udupi a try.  One phone call and they had an entire catered buffet menu worked out, in my price range.  They were completely accommodating and the food was FANTASTIC!  I asked them for mild spice and that's exactly what we got. Everyone raved about the food.  The Special House Curry was especially tasty.  I will be back and can't wait to try other dishes.",

The variety of dips were great. I had the Malai Kofta (veggie & cheese balls deep fried, in a yummy yellow sauce), and it was awesome. Hubby had Palak Paneer (cheese & spinach sauce), and I found it bland but he said it was ok. Paratha stuffed with garlic was ok... the garlic was bitter. I've found garlic is bitter when it's gone too old so I assume that's what happened.  Service was weird. Place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu, which is just odd. There were about 4 different people coming to the table so I don't know who our actual waiter was, but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table. The rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved. Nothing was BAD though, except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things. When we left, one of the employees (who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head) was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didn't use the account anymore. He said he owed money in the account, so if the check deposited, the bank would take the money. I thought this in really bad taste... I really don't want to know.",

They tell us it'll be 10 minutes, wait 15 and then ask about an ETA; they say 10 more minutes because they're waiting in the bread, but the pakora is done so it's sitting under a hot light in the back, yum. 15 minutes later it's actually done.   Long story short, waited half an hour for rice and two orders of bread. Also, the bread was kind of not good. Good paneer pakora though.   Wouldn't recommend. Try Delhi Palace.",

My dear non Indian friends-- The food served in this place is not even 1% representation of what authentic South Indian food is.   Leave about the authenticity of the food (which can be toned down quite a bit to suit the local crowd) but any food that's has absolutely no SALT and served cold (when it's supposed to be served hot), is nothing but a joke. I don't mind paying extra $$ for good food but this is such a place who couldn't bother to either taste the food before getting it out or atleast made an attempt to keep it hot at the beginning of the lunch time.    We returned home hungry after paying 36$ (including tips) -- a total waste. Please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt to taste the food -- even if it's given for free. I won't!!  On a positive side - the service staff was attentive and were trying their best to accommodate the customers. That's not enough for the worst food though.",

    "text": "Udupi is a delicious vegetarian restaurant on the Tempe/Scottsdale line.  It is primarily vegetarian, and also has some vegan offerings.  It has a daily lunch buffet, a good value at $9 on weekdays, that goes up Friday-Sunday.  Being a budget hunter foodie, the lunch buffet fits the bill. The freshly cooked dosa makes a welcome appetizer and I eat it with the coconut and tomato chutneys, both delicious.  Two soups are also available, one a tomatoey lentil soup, quite savoury, and the other is a sour vegetarian soup that has a pleasant tang to it.  The lentil cakes are delicious and, again, go well with the aforementioned chutneys.  After finishing one or two of them I move onto the rice and curries.  I love them all including the matter paneer (peas with cheese cubes), split yellow lentil curry, green bean and coconut curry, and the cauliflower and potatoes.  The buffet also includes dessert, usually something sweet yet healthy, such as the carrot halwa.  You won't be disappointed with the lunchtime buffet.  I've also eaten here a couple times at night.  I love the Gobi Manchuria, so much so that it's what I ate both times.  It tastes like a vegetarian Orange Chicken--a dish that will satisfy even the meat eaters amongst us.    Check out this place, support a local business, and enjoy a delicious meal and good service.",

Veggies have good texture - Cooked enough that each veggie is distinguishable and each have their separate texture rather than being so cooked they all fall apart the same way or together. I found the mix a bit heavier (think stew) than I prefer, so if you mix it with less rice the veggies carry the flavor on their own really well. I would definitely eat here again. A very filling meal, I could easily get 3 meals out of one rice, and one curry. Raita was extremely and less thick than average.",

I found out this is southern Indian food, so they do it a little different and they don't have naan which is probably a good thing for limiting my carb intake. The navratan korma was so good although I am not 100% sure it's vegan; the friend I am with says it is. I looked up navratan korma, definitely made with ghee most the time dammit. Oh well. The vegetable biryani had a few chunks of ginger that I didn't care for. But overall love this place and I want to go back!",

The dishes rotate a little different every time, but there's always at least 4-5 main dish options, plus as much rice, bread, soup, and salad you can eat. Oh and dessert too.  I honestly still don't know the names of most of the dishes but I love just about every one they put out. I usually try a little bit of everything over a thin bed of rice, and grab some dipping sauce for the awesome potato-stuffed pancake roll (my naming) they bring to your table.  Most dishes are vegan and gluten free, but you'd be safe to ask if you are strict on either one. I eat mostly GF & vegan myself and it's nice to have a place that caters to my preferences.  I've only ever come for the lunch buffet, which is $10 on weekdays and $13 on weekends, and if you come here hungry you'll get more than your money's worth.  Seriously, grab your friends and check this place out. You won't regret it.",

All food items like Panner Butter Masala, Aloo tikki, biryani were too delicious. All the guests really liked food taste and appreciated the same.   At the end, no food was left which indirectly shows that they enjoyed food !!  Many thanks to Udupi management specially Gaurav, who gave us sufficient concession as well and delivered the food on time without compromising quality.   Thank you Udupi cafe for making my daughter's birthday event memorable !!",

    "text": "Udupi is good.really good!  I only wish we had some thing similar here in PDX.  Most of the Indian buffets here mehh Udupi is all vegetarian/vegan. I never ordered off the menu, always buffet.  Before Udupi this place was a Chinese restaurant. Cant recall but it was menu and at some point it changed ownership and became a chinese buffet. When it was chinese food menu/ and buffet it was average. One of those places you sort of forgot about until you happen to drive by.  Then one day we went there for Chinese food and it was closed. And i think that was late 2002 or some time in 2003. And at that time it was just abandoned. Udupi had yet to open. Then some time in 2003 some friends invited me out to lunch. I didnt know where we were going they simply asked me if i liked Indian food. To my surprise we arrived at the location of the closed and abandoned chinese restaurant. And now it was an Indian restaurant. That frist time eating at Udupi was great. I was hooked(lol) I made it one of my go to buffets....weekly. And usually on a Saturday or Sunday; Because they offer more items on the buffet during the weekend. Some thing ive seen in Las Vegas also.  Udupi has changed over the years in the begining 2003 to about 2007 it was excellent. Their was always a change of food on the buffet. And it was delicious. Never boring. I dont know exactly when im guessing but at some point in 2007 or 2008 Udupi changed ownership. And then it went through another change of ownership a few years after the frist change. Udupi was never as good as it was in its frist 3 years.  Reason is, they stopped changing out the buffet offerings and if they did chamge them out it was never any thing exciting or out of the ordinary. It was still good and i still continued to eat there but, i was not as excited or looking forward to going to Udupi like in the early years.  I now live far away and the last time i went to Udupi was probably in April 2015.   And if i were living in Phoenix im sure i would be making a weekly stop over at Udupi for delicious lunch buffet. So if your vegetarian/vegan and you find your self in Phoenix during lunch hour  11-2.30. Head over to Udupi and fill up on some yummy south Indian food.",

Just ten minutes down the road from the airport, I always look forward to the scrumptious Indian food on tap here.   I have no idea what anything is called, but they have these HUGE pancake-type things that are wrapped around this crazy-good potato stuff, and may daughters go crazy for them. I have to sneak a bite when they're getting something from the buffet. And speaking of the buffet, everything is vegetarian, with vegan offerings clearly marked (even the sauces/dressings).   Be warned, some of the dishes are weld-level spicy, while others are very mild, and most things somewhere in between. My advice is: take a very small sampling of everything and go back for more of your favorites. Oh, and come hungry - there's no way you will have room for dessert.",

    "text": "My husband and I love Indian food, and Udupi has fast become a favorite. We've been for both the lunch buffet and regular dinner service.  The gobi manchurian gets mentioned quite a bit because it's awesome. Sadly, I haven't seen it at the lunch buffet yet, but it's a must order at dinner. The chole batura is another favorite Southern Indian dish, and Udupi's version is great. The puffy batura reminds me of a lighter version of fry bread, and the chickpeas are wonderfully spiced.  The lunch buffet is lots of fun. Delicious masala dosai are brought to the table, and they will even bring you a second helping. Not that there isn't tons more to choose from at the buffet. The Northern style curries like saag paneer and aloo gobi are pretty good, but the Southern dishes are better. We love getting the coconut studded rice here. So different than the basmati served at other Indian places. The sambar is really spicy, and I love dipping the pleasantly sour idli into it. I would skip the paratha though as it tastes more like a plain tortilla. We always finish up with dessert to put out the fire although we're usually bursting at the seams at that point. It's great when you can get stuffed with terrific food you couldn't possibly make at home for less than $10 per person.  We'll still stick with our long-time favorite, Nandini, for Northern dishes, but Udupi is top for Southern Indian.",

We've tried a sizesble portion of the menu and have loved all of it. I do food somewhat spicy, he does food spicier than I (but not Thai hot), and their food fit the bill perfectly for spice level. The staff were friendly, water glasses kept full. Excellent.  Two weeks ago, I went with my young son and ordered muter paneer bland for him and vegetable manchurian for myself -- two of my favorites.  Both dishes were hotter than anything I've ever eaten there. My son just ate plain rice. My stomach burned for a couple of hours. The waitstaff didn't come over to check on us. When we were finally able to flag her down, she apologized, comped his meal, asked if he wanted something else (no).  Went tonight with my beau. Got those same two dishes, and again, they were painfully hot. Noses running, eyes watering, not at all enjoyable. Definitely not eating the leftovers for lunch (as per our usual plan). Mr. I Like It Spicy agreed that the food was uncomfortably hot.  Again, no attention to the table between food being dropped off and the check being tossed onto the table.  The difference was stark enough that I wonder if they changed hands, or if a new person is making decisions, because it ain't the old Udupi, for sure.  Maybe it'll change back, but I won't be there to find out.",

It was pretty close to my apartment and I decided to give them a try. They also have Eat24 so I could order online and it was ready when I got there to pick it up.  Sometimes I have to wait a little while, but it's never more than 5-10 minutes.    I tend to get the same thing every time- the vegetable samosas and the palak paneer- and I am never disappointed. The spice can sometimes vary on the dishes but I've never had it be bland or unbearably spicy. The food is always hot and the portions are quite large. The palak paneer also comes with rice which is nice because a lot of other restaurants in the area don't include the rice.  I always have leftovers and can eat it for lunch the next day. I order from here probably every other week and even though I now live farther away, I still order online here and make the drive.",

I am vegan, and appreciate the labeling on each dish, although, sometimes they seem to mix up vegetarian and vegan, so make sure you read the food labels if you have restrictions.    The dinner prices are okay.  I've been twice.  The first time I was extremely disappointed with the gobi manchurian. Overly salty without much other flavor to balance it out.  The second time I had the cauliflower dosai, which was much better. I found it too oily and left with a stomach ache, but still,the flavors were nice.  The samosas are also good, along with the chili pakora, and samosa chat.    The service is also hit and miss. We had a young lady last time that was very helpful and friendly.  The times we have gotten the man, he has been a little ornery; he seemed almost bothered he has customers. Weird.

    "text": "I'm literally writing this as I eat the Gobi Manchurian and I am so happy this restaurant exists. Vegans rejoice! All items are vegetarian and vegan items are clearly denoted so you don't have to ask questions. Indian cuisine wasn't my #1 favorite type of food, but this place has totally changed my mind.  There are so many delicious vegan options such as the Gobi, which reminds me of crispy chicken dishes you might find in a Chinese restaurant with the sauce-covered breaded cauliflower. Even if you eat meat, this is a total winner. It's spicy and super filling, one of my favorite restaurant items in the area.   The vegetable biryani is another favorite of mine with great spices and depth of flavor. You really can't go wrong with any dish you order here. I can't wait to try more of the menu here and I'm lucky enough to live super close to this restaurant.",

A friend brought me out to Udupi and sitting at the table with folded arms I started to try the food and thought to myself this is the best food I've had in a long time!  I loved the unique flavors and the big elephant ear looking thing was amazing.  I couldn't pronounce anything on the menu but everything my friend ordered was so good.

I went twice in the last month all excited at the prospect of good Indian food and found the variety and taste very mediocre at the buffet. We asked the man at the counter as we were leaving if there were new owners and he said no there wasn't but there was a new chef (I'm sure they change chefs a lot more often than that!). We told him the food was not like it used to be and that the variety of the buffet had not changed between the two times we had been in the last month. Very disappointed and probably won't be back anytime soon.The place has sure changed from what it used to be.",

Udupi Cafe does the traditional Indian buffet lunch perfectly.  At least on weekends & holidays.  The week-day lunch is a little disappointing, not in quality but in variety.  The weekend/holiday lunch buffet is full of variety.  Being vegetarian, its nice to have a buffet full of tasty options without worry.  The majority of dishes are vegan & clearly marked.  Everything is tasty & well seasoned.    You wont find any Tandoori options here, so no Naan.  But, the Dosa is absolutely delicious & don't hesitate to ask for more.  I have even witnessed a 4 foot long Dosa being served to a family, so bring your  friends & maybe get lucky.",

I dined with a group of friends late on a Friday evening. Opting for adventure, most of us ordered blindly from the extensive - all vegetarian - menu, selecting whatever \"sounded good\". There are tons of vegan options as well.   I ordered Palek Paneer (my Indian food barometer). It was spicy, fresh, and filled with cubes of paneer.  The house specialty Vegetable Manchurian are meatball-sized chunks of crispy deliciousness dripping with sweet chili sauce. They reminded me of a spicy crispy honey chicken, but vegan! The dosai (crepes) my friends ordered were huge flavorful pockets filled with spicy veggies. The light pillows of paratha (bread) reminded me of sopapillas. Chili Pakora appetizers were insanely delicious, an Indian pepper popper, & a definite \"gotta try it\" for any fan of spicy.   Fantastic service. Water glasses were kept full. Waiters were attentive, and the food was served piping hot and quickly, even for our large party.  I will definitely return to satisfy my new craving for Palek Paneer & Vegetable Manchurian, and to try something new.",

    "text": "So here's the deal... I love Indian food. I grew up with easy access to some great examples of it growing up (partly due to my friends' parents). But since moving to Arizona a few years back, it's been difficult finding good places for some Indian cuisine.  A few months back, I was driving down Scottsdale Road and a sign caught my eye... 100% vegetarian. I later discovered that it was an Indian restaurant that was held in pretty high regard from a few of my friends and I knew that I had to give it go... I've now been to Udupi Cafe for lunch a few times. Pretty much the only thing that I would change would be it's location to Central Phoenix so I could eat there more often!  Udupi's lunch buffet is awesome (especially for less than $10)! It has a good selection of flavorful dishes (most of which are actually vegan). The usual favorites are in attendance (a variety of chutneys, dhal, paratha, etc.) as well as a few dishes that are a little more particular to Udupi (the lemon rice is great).  In addition to the selections at the buffet, you are also served an amazing curried potato-filled dosa with your meal. For those of you unfamiliar with dosai, they are the Indian equivalent of a French crepe that's made from rice (not that I'm one of them, but they're also great for people that are trying to be gluten-free). The filling aside (which is tasty though nothing super special), the actual dosa crepe at Udupi is one the best that I've ever had in Phoenix or elsewhere! Awesome texture and flavor!!!  Although I can only comment on their lunch buffet, I would imagine that the rest of their food would only be better. Bottom line: a great place for Indian food in the Phoenix-metro area (the best that I've had so far)!",

Even my boyfriend, who is a serious meat eater, bugs me to go there all the time. I will definitely go there whenever in the mood for some great Indian food.",

    "text": "YUM!  The atmosphere is a bit of a downer (huge open space that's kinda blah) but the food makes up for it.  We went with the Cheese Dosai and the Mutter Paneer.  There is a whole Dosai section of the menu, so we figured we should try one, and the Cheese Dosai stood out to us because it has a lot of stuff in it, whereas many of the others just had chickpeas, onions, and/or potatoes.  I'd never had a dosai before and was surprised when it came out looking and tasting a lot like a quesadilla.  It was really good though and came with some tasty dipping sauces.     The mutter paneer was delicious too with just the right amount of heat.  The portions were kinda huge.  I would love to come back sometime for the lunch buffet to sample just a little of everything.",

    "text": "Really excellent Indian food, with full flavor and large portions. Certainly the best Indian restaurant in the Valley, and all the more special because of the focus on Southern Indian cuisine. The interior has really fantastic large format photographs that will immediately cheer you up. Everything we have ever eaten at Udupi has been delicious.",
