Really nice staff, the bartenders are super nice. We had the Cochinita: fantastic, so tender, so good.  We will definitely go back and try other things from the menu Highly recommended for a date night or refresh yourself in the middle of the week! Cool cool!",

    "text": "I chose this place to host my monthly Meet Up group's Sunday brunch mainly because of the live music advertisement.  We also haven't had a Mexican food inspired brunch so I decided to try it.  We were a party of 12, 2 of the 12 were vegans or vegetarians.  There weren't many options for them to choose from.  One person ordered the breakfast burrito with no meat, added corn, fajita peppers and potatoes.  When the burrito first came out it had nothing but pico and eggs it in.  I saw the server right the other items down so maybe the kitchen folks messed that one up.  I can't remember what vegetarian dish the other person ordered.   Everyone else was pleasantly surprised with what they ordered.  No one sent anything back, a few of us had enough for leftovers.  We were pleased!   I hope I'm quoting this correctly.  The white sangrias were pre-made.  The red sangrias were made to order ... I believe.  It could be the other way around, I'm not quite sure but one of the two are pre-made and purchased.  They're not pre-made as in made earlier in the day when before the restaurant opened, but purchased from a store of some sort.    Also, from where we were seated we couldn't really hear or see the acoustic guitar player at ALL.  Like at ALL!  Perhaps they could have him or the band in a more central location in the restaurant.",

A great place for date night, girls night out, or bringing out of town guests. Everyone from the hostess, to the bussers, server and GM were very welcoming and kind. You can tell they wanted to make sure we were happy with our dining experience.   On to the food: The guacamole is a must - great flavor with orange segments. I discovered the magic of orange segments at the old gallo blanco who until they closed, used to have my favorite guacamole in town... ladera's is probably even better! The elote, cochinta pibil, barbacoa enchiladas and Caesar salad were all very tasty! I really loved my margarita too. You can order it with a small paleta  (popsicle) in it. It doesn't quite melt but adds a hint of sweetness to cut the limey tartness. I recommend the orange popsicle.   I can't wait to go back and try their brunch!",

I must say that alllll of the food was delicious.  The shrimp and fish tacos were some of the best I have ever had..I'd recommend them over the chicken or steak tacos.    The queso was really good and the three salsas they have all had great distinct flavors  The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  The bar made some really tasty margaritas w a nice punch.      The churros were the best I have ever had  Some areas were slow but again manager and server made it all worth it.   Very excited to come back.  Def one of the best and most flavorful Mexican restaurants in PHX   It's a cute and quaint place tucked away in north central PHX.  This place puts Mission to shame",

The doors are wide open and it was freezing inside because we sat right next to the door. they charge for chips and i couldnt believe it. You DO NOT charge for chips at a mexican restaurant. horrible business decision. I guess they know there food is so good they can do whatever they want.. the churros and the mexican corn are both some of the best ive ever had and the chile relleno was different than any other ive had being that it didnt have breading but you dont screw your customers and charge for chips!",

We ordered the ceviche to start and I had the chile relleno , no rice on the side, and husband had the 5 taco platter. The ceviche had very little fish and a lot of fruit. We didn't care for this version. The chile relleno came and it was basically a baked poblano stuffed with rice and very little cheese! You'd think the waitress would say something when I asked for no rice! It doesn't say this on the menu description and is nothing like a traditional relleno. The 5 tacos were good. I had a sangria drink that came with a big dump of cinnamon on top. It was odd and very sweet. Rethink that cinnamon; bad idea!  Husband had a top shelf margarita and it was fine, nothing special. The patio is the draw and I'd try this restaurant again and order different dishes.",

    "text": "Came here on yet another Taco Tuesday expedition after reading rave reviews. I need to take a moment and thank Yelp and all the reviewers for being such a big part of discovering great restaurants around town. This little gem is tucked away from all the hustle bustle of the city. It is actually in a rather quiet part of Phoenix, which is a pretty nice change from the usual. The decor is exceptional.. the weather complied and we chose to sit on the patio. It transports you straight to a five star resort in Mexico. They have a giant fireplace, myriad of beautiful succulents and cacti, a small lawn in the back with some chairs, a live singer.. pretty darn close to a perfect outdoor ambience. They have a reasonable selection of tacos and drinks on happy hour. I started with a Michelada which I thought was quite great! My friend ordered a couple of Al Pastor tacos while I ordered one each of chicken, shrimp and Al Pastor. To be quite honest, I could've easily done without the chicken and shrimp tacos. They were quite disappointing.. chicken especially. It's probably one of the worst chicken tacos I've had so far. Why the four star ratings then? Their Al Pastor is the bomb! Quite possibly one of the best of its kind so far. Next time, I would order three of these without even looking at the menu. The meat is crispy on the outside and beautifully tender inside. Truly fantastic! They also offer free churros with a Yelp check in. They are served with a side of ice cream.. these were also pretty great. In spite of the abysmal chicken and mediocre shrimp tacos, I left feeling quite happy with the place overall.. which does not generally happen with me. Definitely a keeper!",

I decided to give it one more go for brunch and it was great! I went again for dinner and again, so much better now than in the beginning. I'm not sure what you changed, chefs perhaps or just listened to all the reviews but it's finally a place I like to go especially since it's walking distance and I love the ambience! Oh and be sure to go on sunday or Thursday because they have an awesome live musician!",

Cool environment, delicious food, good drinks, amazing guacamole and churros! Would definitely come back to this place not because of the free appetizer or dessert...just because they cared about clients and did everything possible to makes us happy that night! Thank you for your service! We really appreciate it!",

It has orange piece which really tastes very good!  The elotes were great too- corn!     We will venture here again for sure but we do recommend a few changes.   Staff more is my first recommendation. On a Saturday night there needs to be more personal attention to your guests. We had more interaction with the runners.  My second and last recommendation is hire more kitchen staff.  It took 40 minutes for our appetizers to come and another 40 for dinner.   Clearly, the restaurant was packed. Over staff for the first few weeks to make the best impression possible. The community and neighbors want this to succeed!!!  Thanks!!!",

We tried the green michelada that had a homemade tomatillo salsa mixed with the beer that was great! I also had the cocktail named El Santo which was great. My wife tried the Pinche Paloma, and the Mezcalada which was really good.   The food was phenomenal. We had the Guacamole and Salsa for an appetizer and the Salsa was next level. My wife had the 5 Taco Platter which is a taco sampler and they were all great. I had the plate of Carne Asada and the black beans that accompanied it were awesome!   The service was great. We had the bartender as our server and he was very friendly and very familiar with the food and drinks so he pointed us towards there best options. The atmosphere was nice. Great music, service and decor.",

I can see that in cooler months enjoying the patio would be an excellent decision.   The staff, particularly the manager,  was fabulous; so helpful and insightful. We ate a delicious appetizer - puerco en chile verde. It had wonderful flavor in more of a brothy sauce. We shared the taco platter, thoroughly enjoying the fish, shrimp, and barbacoa tacos. Completing our dinner was the chile rejano - a non-fried dish that felt fresh and balanced!   To end our meal we inhaled Carmel churros with a Kahuloa chocolate pudding.   The margaritas were a good choice, however the frozen red sangria was the best thing for a hot Arizona summer night!",

Servers/bus staff and bartender were very friendly, we ordered guacamole and chips which were both great and it came with salsa that was amazingly spicy but good.

Consulted Yelp, saw this new-to-us place called Ladera, and decided to give it a try.  Boy, are we glad our first choice was busy, because it led us here.   First off, the decor and ambiance are amazing.  The patio is lovely, the inside is lovely, even the bathrooms are lovely!  Everyone we interacted with was friendly and attentive.  Our server, Junior, was on-point with checking in on us, but not to the point of being obtrusive.  He was able to answer our questions about the menu and made an excellent suggestion for one of our party members who was having trouble deciding.  And now for the food and drink. I could not find a single thing to criticize.  I started off with a Pinche Paloma cocktail, which was so refreshing and delicious (yum, grapefruit!).  I had the Pollo Asado, which was tasty and juicy.  The sides were delicious (street corn!).  Everyone in the party was thrilled with their food. My husband particularly enjoyed the nopalitos.  Although they weren't made exactly the same way as his grandmother used to make them they were delicious and got a huge thumbs up.    We tried two desserts, the fried ice cream and the tres leches cheesecake, and they were amazing.  The next time we come we are definitely trying the cajeta churro.  I have a feeling it will be amazing as well.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I don't even know where to begin with Ladera, so I'll go ahead and jump straight into my favorite.  The burrito! Or should I say, burritos? My go to meat for any burrito is al pastor, but as soon as I read, \"pineapple slaw,\" I was immediately turned away from it and went to my 2nd favorite, carne asada. Why the hate with the pineapple slaw you might ask? Well, it reminds me of pineapple on pizza, which is sacrilegious in my book. You know who you are, you pineapple pizza lovers. You might as well put strawberries and apples on there while you're at it.   Anyway, I can't even begin to describe how amazingly flavorful and full the burrito was. Your typical asada burrito is usually a safe bet. Nothing amazing, but satisfying at the very least. THIS? This just set my standards so high that I probably can't enjoy an average asada burrito the same way anymore.  Allow me to tell you about the al pastor one we ordered. I was sitting at the table when my girlfriend surprised me with ANOTHER burrito, but with al pastor. Often times my reluctance to try something new usually pays off, but this time it backfired... well, not really. I ended up sharing two burritos, so who's the real winner here?  The al pastor burrito was even BETTER than the asada one. The pineapple slaw really works well with all the other deep flavors going on inside the burrito. We couldn't finish it, but it tasted just as good as a microwaved leftover.  Aside from the 2 burritos, their street corn was also pure flavorful goodness. I have a newfound love for cojita cheese as well.  It pains me to know that I will most likely not visit Phoenix for a very long time, but if Ladera is still around, and I genuinely hope they will be around, then you can bet your ass I'm making a stop here as soon as I'm back.",

The salmon was bland and the carne asada had good flavor but was over cooked. Pollo asada was probably the best dish we had. Our waitress was also so incredibly awkward it was almost uncomfortable. Would definitely give it another shot because of the atmosphere but there's better Mexican food in the area for that price.",

Parking can be a problem mainly street parking, evidently they have a lot a block away but I was lucky to find one on the street ironically there is an empty parking lot right next door chained closed.  The best guacamole! Huge chunks of avocado and orange chunks great flavor.  The carne asada tacos were okay the meat was salty and dry lacked flavor.  The highlight was the Chili Relleno, which was fantastic it was like a gourmet version of what you would get in a usual cookie cutter Mexican food restaurant in the valley, chipotle cream sauce was wonderful served with hominy rice (wasn't overly warm but still good).  Fun gothic revival decor makes you think you are in a Spanish mission, great patio for perfect weather like tonight.",

    "text": "Score another winner for the crew at Genuine Concepts.  The same people that brought The Vig, The Womack, Cobra Arcade Bar, Little Woody, Deli Tavern, Linger Longer Lounge and The McMillan to the valley now have a Mexican food concept in an often overlooked neighborhood in CenPho.  My Mom wanted to grab dinner together after work but wanted something close to her home.  Ladera had been on my to do list for awhile so on a Wednesday night it was off to Genuine's Mexican creation.  The location of Ladera at first glance is one that should be ideal.  On the southeast corner of Central Avenue and Alice, Ladera resides just a block north of the popular walking and biking trail along the Arizona Canal.  The Murphy Bridle Path (another popular walking and running trail) ends just a few blocks south of here as well.  Yet despite the plentiful pedestrian and car traffic that travels through this area, no restaurant has been able to maintain staying power here.  Previously it was Corbin's that opened and subsequently closed here, and two other restaurant concepts failed prior to that.  Will Ladera be able to break this trend?  Well, Tucker Woodberry has been known to create comfortable inviting spaces and Ladera is no exception.  On the outside, a huge patio with an outdoor fireplace and even an artificial turf area for cornhole toss.  Inside, dim lighting from overhead chandeliers with brick walls and a fully stocked bar.  But the prominent dark wood accents inside and outside leave little doubt that this place is a Woodberry design.  My Mom and I enjoyed the covered outdoor patio this time around on a perfect spring evening.  The dinner menu at Ladera follows a fairly traditional Mexican playbook of tacos, tortilla based appetizers, enchiladas, full meat plates, as well as various sides.  My Mom and I shared their chips with salsa and guacamole dips.  Ladera's salsa is fairly run of the mill, but sets its guacamole apart by incorporating orange slices (of all things).  Barrio Cafe's extra guacamole ingredient is pomegranates, so I guess oranges are Ladera's thing.  It certainly gives the guac an extra fruity acidic element, but its fairly subtle.  For my main dish, I wanted to sample a variety of flavors.  And what better way to do that than a taco platter.  Ladera's Five Taco Platter are flour tortillas containing five different fillings.  Carne Asada (Beef), Pastor (Pork), Pollo Asada (Chicken), Shrimp, and Fish.  Each with their own unique toppings to compliment the meats and made very much like you'd find from a neighborhood taco stand or taco truck.  The tacos were all outstanding and the meats were cooked perfectly on each.  My favorite of the bunch was probably their fish taco with cabbage, cotija cheese, cilantro, avocado cream and remoulade.  For dessert, I used my Yelp Check-In to get a free order of their Churros.  A half dozen 5 inch churros with a caramel sweet cream sauce topped with pomegranates on the side.  Fantastically delicious with copious amounts of warm cinnamon on the churros themselves and the cream sauce added a sweet, smooth, savory element.  Total cost for the app, entree, dessert, a house margarita (because one must), tax and tip came to about $40.  A little bit on the steep side considering the portion size (especially given that I got the dessert for free).  The chips here aren't free unlike many other Mexican food establishments in town so that may be partly responsible.  That said I really don't have many complaints about the quality of the chips, the rest of the food or of the restaurant itself.  The venue looks like it can pack in upwards of 150-200 at full capacity, making it ideal for big get togethers and it so happens there were a couple of those going on the night we were here.  Whether Ladera reverses the curse of this seemingly idyllic plot of land remains to be seen overtime.  But as an upscale Mexican restaurant option for the mostly upper middle class residents in the area, Tucker Woodberry's concept appears to be well positioned for the long run.  And of course I've probably now jinxed it (sorry, Tucker).",

Many of the items we tried were very tasty - the elote was tasty, the nachos were large and awesome, the tacos were tiny and less awesome. The drinks were alright, but not the best ever. I would definitely come back, maybe for happy hour next time.",

    "text": "Guacamole: Good, but severely lacks spice...like zero (supposed to have Serrano peppers). Orange was awesome, but not enough grilled onion. Comes in a tiny bowl with a ton of chips. Needs more guacamole or maybe even a small side of salsa with it.   Margaritas: Meh. Mix wasn't great.  Chili Rejnos: Dry. Not a $19 dish.  Carne Asada: Meat cooked perfectly. Fresh tortillas. Mexican corn was a bit bland. Beans were WAY over seasoned. Pico de gallo had more spice, from the raw onion than the guacamole from the serrano peppers.  Servers still have \"first day jitters\" and are still learning the menu, but was really trying.   -----  Stopped in for lunch on Friday (2nd day)  Food was fairly good, the staff was clearly trying to find their grooves.  Edit:  I've checked in twice (from during the first week) and I'm still \"The Duke\"",

    "text": "Used to be Corbins, but gutted and remodeled. Food was ok on a cold and rainy January night, but to be frank, nothing very creative or terribly interesting.  It was like a Cantino Laredo or some such bland fare that you can get anywhere really.    The menu was really boring I thought.  The usual stuff, guacamole and chips for $10,  \"street\" type tacos, typical dishes such as half a rotisserie chicken with latin infused herbs and spices.  Had the Baracoba with beans.  It was nice but it didn't come out too hot.  Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for table to be dried as it was still damp from being wiped down, skinny jean bearded hipster waiter was nice enough but he was lacking in checking in.  Had Churros, he didn't tell me they were filled with Dulce sweet sauce stuff inside.  Didn't care for that, asked if in the future can the churros be made w/o that sickening sweet sauce stuffed inside.  He checked and said no......FROZEN, pre made Churro alert******  Booth Tables are this awful fake leather material that leave marks and are hard to keep clean, bad idea alert******  House margarita was fresh but lacked a buzz!!  Pretty place, may go back to have a drink and some appetizers at the bar next time but not rushing back in general.  Generic, boring, but at least its not a old gutted out building anymore so that's a plus in that area of Sunnyslope.  Was expecting better food and service.  Pretty place though.

Great table presence, great job connecting without being intrusive, and good recommendations/answers to my questions about what to eat.  Just as importantly, she did a great job treating my daughter as she would any other guest.  Simple stuff when we think about it, yet so often it gets missed in the hospitality industry.  The MOD came by and did a table check and made a little conversation--but not too much, and not canned.  This is also a place where you can find just about any tequila you would ever want!  Food was great. I appreciated that the only options for kids weren't a bean burrito, quesadilla, and chicken tenders. My daughter got the carne asada tacos and loved them--especially the guac that came on the side! My barbacoa was off the charts, and the girlfriend's 5 taco combo was killer too.",

    "text": "Last night me and my homies...sexuals met up for dinner and the spot formerly known as Corbins.  Okay, so we pull up and the first thing I see is valet parking, which usually sets my douchometer into overdrive.  I think to myself, DAMN, why must we always have to efin valet my 1997 Toyota Corolla!  That feeling of annoyance quickly dissipated when we saw a self-service parking lots a few yards up from the restaurant.  To valet or not valet, the choice is yours.  As we approached the restaurant it was nothing like the old Corbins, this place has had a total make over, totally cool vibe with great enclosed patio area.    We were seated outside on a high top, and folks details are my thang, this table was large enough to hold several plates, entrees, drinks, jackets, phones, emotional support animals and our drama.  Anyways, I loved the big spacious tables.  Speaking of details, my friends and I had a great evening of conversation, largely because there wasnt music blaring forcing us to yell at each other (TACO GUILD), again little details like these influence our dining choices with friends.    Our server was truly amazing!  Dang, I forgot her name, but the young girl with the nose piercing, you were amazeballs!    Now to the meat and potatoes (or um carne y papas) of the review.  The food was the icing on the cake.  Every entree and drink we had enjoyed at our table was fantastic.  I ordered the Barbacoa beef, holy cow that was efin awesome.  My other half ordered the carne asada skirt steak, that was just as good, if not better.  Our orders came with homemade tortillas, we had both corn and flour, and they were good enough to eat on their own!  Every person at our table not only enjoyed the food, but the drinks and ambiance.  To get 5 fickle gays to all agree on food, drink and ambiance is like getting 5 women to agree on a single bridesmaids dress.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour and to try the Mole and nopalitos tacos.",

The menu offered totally delivers on many levels... especially if you are a fan of this cuisine...The only negative for me is that the cocktails consist mainly of ice... 3 sips of the margarita and you are left slurping. I was a bartender for many years... Rene's, Shugrue's both in Sedona.... but really these cocktails were 3/4th ice. I get not wanting people to get comatose but I think a bit of an adjustment is in order other than that keep up the good vibe! .",

I had brunch chicken enchiladas, chicken was a bit dry which would have been solved had the two over easy eggs been over easy instead of hard absolutely zero runny yolk even after the waiter verified with me that I wanted them over easy????

The ceviche is also a go to for me. The menu optiond are great and drinks are also good here.",

We ordered the top shelf margarita and an OG Margarita and both were excellent with plenty of quality tequila at a modest price.   We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and it was delicious and not your typical preparation as they added bits of orange and pepitos which was a refreshing change. The Guac was served with homemade tortilla chips and house salsa which was excellent.   My wife had the chicken tacos and a crispy fish taco and both were very good but the fish portion was meager.   I had the enchiladas with Barbacoa which were incredible.  Tender flavorful beef stuffed into tortillas covered with two different colorful sauces.  These were some of the best enchiladas I've ever had and I've eaten at hundreds of Mexican joints.    I will definitely return to Ladera next time in the area!",

My boyfriend had the OG marg and the taco platter and I had the pork pibil taco, pastor taco, and shrimp taco, the mezacolada, and the red sangria. We also tried the queso fundido and Chile de arbol and house salsas. The food was ok, nothing special especially for Phoenix, so 3 stars. The cocktails were easily the star of the show - 5 stars. The atmosphere is super cute and the service was understaffed but still good considering. I'd probably come back for happy hour drinks only.",

The guacamole was delicious. The pepitas added a nice crunch. The shaved corn was to die for. The green chili I eventually ate by the spoonful. We also got the 5 taco platter. I wasn't a huge fan of the pastor because the pork was a little chewy but the fish taco was delicious and the pollo asado was so good I would have ordered a separate plate of those if I wasn't so stuffed. The patio was also super cute!",

How does it happen that an appetizer is ordered and delivered and no beverages are delivered?  I got up.... took the silverware off another table . Asked another server for some plates and at least water.  She was so nice and of course brought them. Our server never said a word. No apologies.  I really like you Ladera!!

Guacamole was superb as well as their fresh fried corn tortilla chips. I had the oven roasted street tacos from their happy hour menu for 6 bucks. Just the right amount because the chips and guac really filled me up while sucking down the margs! My hubby had the pork tacos and he loved them. Friends had burritos that were delicious. Service was excellent by the way. Found out it is also owned by the owners of The Vig another local Phoenix restaurant.  The ambiance is modern Mexican and just spot on. From the super cool long bar to the gorgeous al fresco patio. Cement tiles and wood combo make it the perfect urban Latin atmosphere. We will definitely be going back - SOON!",

The young staff seems to operate in reactive mode, and we kept having to ask for dirty dishes to be taken away. There was a bus boy, but he seemed to only clear empty tables. I do not think management has asked him to comb through current dining tables to remove dirty dishes. There did not seem to be a manager on staff, just a couple of servers.  Parking is terrible, not sure where people are supposed to park on busy evenings.",

Oh, and the carne asada plating is so so so sad, who hurt the chef? Out of all of the amazing Mexican food joints in Phoenix, why eat Mexican food here?!   Like I mentioned, I've given it the ole college try a few (or five) times and the only thing that I would go back for over and over again is the cocktail menu. That mezcalada is liquid magic.",

Importantly to us, the service was great, yet unobtrusive at the same time.  Perhaps the best feature was their outstanding outdoor patio area.  What a great gathering place for drinks or dinner.

Inside was just as perfect and finally a restaurant where you can sit inside and have a conversation.  Food was delicious for 3 out of 4 of us. The guacamole and chips were outstanding.  3 of us had the Cochinita Pibil tacos, which are 3 small tacos in a soft corn tortilla. No sides come with any of the tacos. The other person in our party originally ordered the chicken mole but switched when he found out that it was just a leg thigh and wing for $25. You should get a whole chicken for that price.  Instead he went with the Rellenos and it was good but super spicy.  Why not 4 stars? I think they are a little pricy for what you get. Service was good but when we received our split bill it was off. If we hadn't caught it we would had paid $20 more than what the bill actually was. It was corrected but the charge had already been put through so now we have to wait for the credits.  I will go back again because I would like to give them another chance and see the restaurant be successful but I do think they need to adjust their prices just a little.",

I ordered tecate and the wife had a hot spicy margarita.  Beware u get chips which are excellent but have to order them and pay for the salsa which is kind of ridiculous. But the chips and salsa are excellent.   3 types. All good.  I ordered the 5 taco plate didn't need more than 3.  My fish taco and carne asada were great.    Others decent. My wife ordered a two enchilada plate and I had to help finish them.  The sauce was about the best I've ever tasted     My two kids had steak taco and a burrito     All in all this place was excellent.

Our waiter was in our face and asking us if we needed something every 30 seconds which seemed like overkill. I loved the decor and setting. Hopefully the waiter and taco situation will get sorted out in time!",

He loved it, i loved it, so much that we came back that Sunday for brunch, since Miguel also plays on Sundays. Brunch was great. They have $4 mimosas, can't beat that :)",

I quickly ordered a delicious margarita ($8) and some chips and salsa.  Unfortunately this place charges for chips and salsa ($6) which I always find extraordinarily cheap.  The chips were solid (almost too hard) and not very flavorful.  The salsas were all excellent and I ate almost all of them! I was between a few dishes and the bartender suggested that I try the stuffed poblano.  It arrived so quickly I couldn't believe it!  It was a great option if you're a vegetarian (which I'm not) but it was very flavorful although perhaps a bit lighter than what I wanted because I was sort of hungry.  The atmosphere is what makes this place.  Not my favorite Mexican spot but I will check it out again.",

    "text": "Ladera is a place I stumbled upon on Yelp while searching for new Mexican restaurants. Reviews are good and pictures looked decent, so naturally, we had to give them a-go. We've since visited twice and have found a few pros and cons from our experiences.  We always order their guacamole, which I'd say is fine for the $6.50 happy hour price, but not quite worth the regular ten dollar price point. We've become particularly hard on guac in the past several months after establishing our \"gold standard,\" so it takes a lot to impress us. It's just good, straight-up, standard guacamole. Furthermore, their elote, which we ordered shaved, is decent - helped by the addition of the extra ingredients as usual. Their puerco en chile verde is okay, but is best enjoyed with a spoon.  Both times we visited, we ordered six tacos, sampling their carne asada, cochinita pibil, and nopalitos, which I've actually never tried before. All tacos are decent quality, although what's unusual is that I remember the asada being spectacular on our first visit - having that lovely smoky meat flavor that we both associate with good asada tacos. The second time around, the meat was a bit bland and did not taste anywhere near as good as the first time. My girlfriend and I were both a bit baffled as to why. I'm not sure if this was due to a change in recipe or simply just chalked up to inconsistencies. Furthermore, sides of charred and refried beans are just okay.  For dessert, we've had their fried ice cream, which consists of chocolate chip ice cream, corn flakes, kahlua cream, and a bit of spiced honey. The dessert is topped off with a miniature churro that's filled with cajeta. We love our fried ice cream and definitely were pleased with their clever little take on it. We've also ordered their stand-alone churros, which come with a bit of Mexican chocolate for dipping. They are also decent.  Overall, I see this is a cool little restaurant. Their patio looks nicely designed, with live music playing that's piped throughout the entire restaurant (including the restrooms). Server was very friendly.  Are there better places out there? Definitely. But I still see them as a respectable option.  Recommended to try out.",

    "text": "Such a good pick! The bf and I had both never been, and let's be honest... when I'm not hangry,  his world is muuuuuch brighter.   We sat at the bar, and matty was our bartender. He was super great. But here's the breakdown of what we ordered:  Drinks: I had the Telenovella. Super delicious cocktail of Chile vodka, ginger, pineapple and lime. He had the NMT hefeweizen. It's from North Mountain brewery, and one of the best hefe's we've ever tasted.   Appetizer: the queso dip. Small yet perfect amount of queso with homemade chips. You can totally tell the chips were a fresh batch, they were thick and not salty. The queso was a wonderful blend with the perfect amount of spice and flavor.   Entree: I had the 3 shrimp tacos. So flavorful, and with the green chilli sauce it was like heaven in my mouth. I seriously did a little shimmy after my 1st bite. He ordered a quesadilla with barbacoa. I'm not a huge red meat fan, but a few bites of that and I was back in heaven. The meat was tender,  juicy, flavorful and balanced well with the cheese.   Dessert: bc we checked in via Yelp,  we got free churros. They are mini (like the length of your middle finger) and filled with caramel. So. Dreamingly. Perfect!!!! We asked and that's the only way they are served, meaning you cant order them without the caramel filling.   There also happened to be live acoustic music playing, so the vibe was really chill. The decor is awesome and there is an outside patio with misters.   For $50, we felt like it was well worth it and will definitely be going back. Soon & hopefully for brunch",

Arriving at the restaurant, there was parking out back which was lite and clearly marked. Ladera is right on the corner - from the outside it looks very sleek with a beautiful stone doorway and black iron detailing through the front. Inside was even more stunning (please note my photos to see it for yourself)!  When we sat down, we were greeted by a very pleasant server, Katrina. We all started with margaritas - two blended and two spicy on the rocks. She was knowledgable and read our table very well which I feel is a very important (but not always present) quality to have as a server. We started with some guacamole and street corn which were both visually appealing it also so incredibly delicious. In fact, every single dish that hit our table was beautifully placed with undeniably delicious flavours. Katrina gave our table some time to order mains as she could tell we wanted to chat and catch up - thank you!  My boyfriend and I shared the ensalada de cobb and carne asada. Again, the flavours were out of this world! If I could break the 5 star rate scale, Ladera would be up there! Drinks were always full, the food was spectacular and we even got free churros for checking in! These perfectly warmed churros were filled with caramel and chocolate fillings. We all agreed that they were the best churros we had ever had!!!!!  On our way out we stopped to play a couple round of Corn Hole. I truly mean it when I say this restaurant couldn't have knocked our socks off any more.",

    "text": "Wow - we had a great time, great service and great food. Our waitperson, Carline was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations that we really loved.   We started out with a pair of Paloma cocktails that tasted very refreshing in the hot summer weather. While sipping our cocktails, we munched on the outstanding guacamole with pumpkin seeds and oranges that was super creamy and delicious.   For our entree, my wife had a good shrimp burro (aka burrito) and I had a marvelous chili relleno with barbacoa on the side. The relleno was different (and better from my perspective) from most rellenos. It wasn't battered and deep fried, it was char grilled only. The STAR of the show was the barbacoa. It was tender, spicy and very flavorful and layered. Best barbacoa I've ever had. I Highly recommend it.  Can't wait to go back.",

Walked in at 9:45 and while the hostess was pleasant, the bartender came rushing out to inform us that the hours listed had changed, they were closing soon, and we would need to place our order within 5 minutes. He apologized the owner hadn't updated the hours (wait... Phoenix, October, busy season approaching and you are closing earlier on weekends?)  It was a busy Friday evening, and coming from a service industry background...it's obvious when the staff is more interested in closing than serving and keeping clientele. Side note--we tried a couple times to call prior to arriving, to inquire about reservations and such - but never had anyone answer the phone.  After my two dinner companions had already walked out the door, not appreciating the rude behavior, the hostess was apologetic and understanding, even trying to reassure we could order food, while the bartender had already retreated back to his side work. Menu looked interesting, unfortunately the \"manager/bartender\" killed any chance of my business or referal.",

    "text": "I wish my group could have gotten a 5-star experience! Let's see what happened that made these stars drop off...  1. We had to constantly ask for water; at one point we pulled over a different server and asked him to bring us a pitcher 2. I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to a cocktail (although I must say - it was delicious!) and after 2 sips, sent it back, and switched to a simple beer. When the bill came the cocktail was still included. If I was going to be charged for it, I would have given it to someone else sitting at my table. 3. The table split the bill, but 1 person got charged an extra $21.00. The problem was solved quickly when pointed out, but if the server was initially confused she should have verified with us. 4. 1 person had a plate full of leftovers, and when the server came to clear it she asked if she could have a box. The server offered to box it for her. My friend said \"are you sure? you have a lot of plates...\" but was reassured it wasn't a big deal. The box was never brought out, and we found out the food was thrown away.  5. We got the free churros with the yelp check-in and when they finally came out my friend picked one up and burnt her finger so bad it left a blister. I wish they would've given a heads up that they were scalding hot. Maybe if the table had water she could have cooled off her skin quickly....:)  All the events individually weren't a big deal, but when it all happens during your first impression it certainly taints the experience (especially when it's your birthday...). Overall, everyone enjoyed their food...when fingers weren't being burned or food wasn't been thrown away. The patio atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. You have to park in a dirt lot, but it's better than driving around the neighborhood looking for a spot! I'm sure the experience was a fluke, maybe we'll come back after the blister heals.",

    "text": "I'm honestly very confused by the Arizona Republic on their review regarding this new Genuine Concepts restaurant, I've only had good experiences here. I've been here quite a few times since they opened and have tried a lot of what's on their menu, their food is amazing. Despite living in Arizona for 18 years, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to that serves authentic Mexican food that I truly enjoy. The tacos (especially the pollo and carne) are outstanding, never too heavy and always meet my expectations. The pollo entree is out of this world, chicken is extremely tender, perfectly seasoned and comes with side of fresh made tortillas.. YUM!! The nachos are huge.. literally a pile of tortilla chips, meat, cheese, guac and so much other yummy goodness on one plate, would definitely recommend ordering this when with a big group because it could easily feed 10 people as an appetizer. The quesadilla, although may sound pretty basic and standard was seriously one of the best I've ever had and you wanna know why... cause it's fried and topped with salsa and guac! Now to the desserts... I've tried all 3... multiple times. The fried banana being my favorite, it's amazing, comes with side of ice cream and the mix of the 2 is simple and tastes amazing. The fried ice cream and churro are also 2 desserts I recommend, so yummy! The ambiance of the restaurant was very cool, lots of seating indoor and outdoor. Friendly staff, amazing food, and a beautiful restaurant.",

I ordered a frozen margarita- was surprised to find out that the frozen margarita was bartender's choice, which tonight was a smoky mango? Not for me but the waitress happily took it back. Thick tortilla chips. Salsa trio was good.   I do agree with previous review about tortillas, definitely the thick corn tortillas you buy in a grocery store. I had heard portions were small for the price. Guacamole was very tasty but I do have an objection to paying $10 for what appears to be less than one cup. My partner had the chile relleno which he liked, I had the Tijuana Caesar, which was good, although it said it was to be dressed with jalapeno ranch, but I received a vinaigrette. Definitely would skip the pork verde as it was watery, bland and had very few chunks of pork in it.  The eggs, both on my salad and pork verde were undercooked and still jelly like.  A lot of these things are new restaurants jitters, which may resolve in time, except for the portion size, which I expected having heard from 3 different couples, but still not a good starting rep.",

We sat for at least 10  minutes without anyone approaching our table, and only when I stood up to leave did a server appear.  After that, however, all was well and the service was attentive.  We ordered the salsa trio to start and all of the salsas were very flavorful and fresh tasting.  I ordered the shrimp and blood orange salad.  The shrimp was very tasty, but the underlying greens were overdressed, and marcona almonds were chopped too fine to be tasted, and the fried pieces of cotifja cheese were too salty to eat.  Overall, not a great dish.  My husband ordered their version of a cobb salad and it looked great!  Lots of chicken and veggies.  He loved it.  We will return to this neighborhood place, perhaps for happy hour and to try the tacos.....",

The atmosphere was perfect for a warm and sunny weekend night.   We made it in time for happy hour, and they have really great deals so we took advantage and just ordered off that menu. First, my boyfriend had the house margarita and I had the Pinche Paloma. He really enjoyed his and said it was pretty strong. Mine didn't seem to have much tequila in it and was a little more carbonated than I like, but still good.   For an appetizer, we had the guacamole with chips, and it was super tasty. They put a lot of cheese and pepitas in it which I really liked, and they give you a good amount with tons of chips (and free refills), which was nice because a lot of places can be kinda stingy on that lol.   Then, for dinner we split the pastor and carne asada tacos. This was one of those places where once I was eating them, I was like, omg this is why I love tacos so much - they were amazing! It was hard to decide, but I think the pastor were my fave - I loved the pineapple pieces on top.    Then, for dessert, we had the churros (you get a free order when you check in!), which have a salted caramel in the middle and come with a chocolate/whip cream sauce. Those were excellent as well :) I would definitely recommend this place if you're into tacos, and I know we will be back soon!",

Plus, it was in her hood.  We sat outside, which it was a windy day that day.  I had the manhattan, which I gather was with house whiskey.  Dunno.  UGHHH!!  So I asked for a manhattan with Bulleit Bourbon.   She had a happy hour margarita.  UGHHH!   She didn't like it either.   I told her to send it back but she didn't.  She did ask for them to put in more of whatever they sweeten it with.  When she got it back, she said it was better but she still didn't really like it.  I ordered the COCHINITA PIBIL from the menu, but I noticed on the bill it said puerco pibil.  I don't know if that's the same thing.  She ordered the happy hour pollo tacos and a quesadilla.  Mine came with a side of black beans and I asked for flour tortillas versus the corn.  The food was bland.   It needed some sort of kick.  She said her tacos lacked umff as well.  I told her maybe it needed salsa -- or something!   She asked Sarah, our server, for salsa.   She said it helped a little.   I was thinking that's what I should have had as well.  I took most of my meat dish home.  Since I have salsa, I added some of that to it.   It seemed to give it a little boost.  I think they are trying to be a Richardson's, which I do like the flavoring of their foods.   It just lacked flavor -- or something.  Sarah was pleasant and professional.   I think this is one of the Genuine Concept restaurants I won't be visiting again.",

I was attracted by the brunch drink specials that they have.  I was looking for something other than bottomless mimosas and found it.  They offer $4 margaritas, mimosas, sangrias, bloody maries and micheladas.  They had a blended sangria that day that was delicious!  I hope they keep it on the menu. My favorite was the margarita, though.    We ordered the El Americano, the Steak Ranchero and the Barbacoa Hash. All good.  I look forward to trying more of their dishes.  The service was top notch!

They remade it and the assistant manager spoke with me that they were going to speak with the chef. I do hope that they have spoken with the chef because every chef should know what vegan is because someone could get seriously ill if they eat dairy or meat. I haven't ate it in years and it has turned into an allergy now where I would become ill if I ate either.",

The salsa is chunky and the freshest I've had in recent memory. The chicken enchiladas were cheesy but also hearty with savory, simmered chicken. The French toast was unique and unlike anything else in town (but make sure you're a coconut fan). It's clear they put time and skill into these dishes. I'm so thankful this place is in our neighborhood---we will be back!!!! And now, I'm going to go enjoy this Saturday food coma. :)",

I had the El Santo, like a margarita with whiskey. So good! And we ordered the carne asada tacos with a side of elotes,  seasoned corn. It was all delicious! The carne asada had great flavor with caramelized onion,  and was served on handmade corn tortillas. Also,  we had the churros for dessert.  They are filled with this amazing caramel sauce,  and served with an incredible tasting chocolate sauce and bits of pomegranate. Just wow!  Our server was Tony.  He was so attentive,  personable,  and took time to answer our 20 questions about the cocktails and food. The best service I have had in ages! I will definitely be back soon! Ladera is my new favorite restaurant!",

All of our norm spots had wait times and didn't want to wait with two little ones so a friend recommended this place and we went. We started off with the Sangria Tinta and guac! Really tasty with a hint of citrus flavor and the salsa had a real KICK to it. My hubby ordered 1/2 chicken and my mom and I ordered the pollo Asada burros but with shrimp. My mom loved hers...me not so much. The crema wasn't my cup of tea. The kids ordered chicken and rice and quesadillas. Our waitress Tera was the BEST! Very down to earth and great energy! Please ask for her. Oh a got the churros for dessert...another winner. We will be back!",

She was very helpful with recommendations from the menu. She was right the gucamole was amazing! I normally dont get guac from restaurants but its good. So good i caught myself thinking about it the other day at work. The tacos were delicious- the shrimp and carne asada were my favs. There was a singer outside  ( may 5th) and he did an amazing job.  I am a sucker for live music.  Overall this place is 5 stars- they have a parking  lot, great service, great food, drinks are not pricey, beautiful design and decor.",

For starters, I ordered the elote. You can never go wrong with elote. It wasn't too heavy on the sauce and cheese like some elotes which I loved. We had the guacamole which was just okay - a little bland for my taste but still worth getting. For my main dish, I had the cochinita pibil which I loved. It came in a mountain of pork deliciousness, warm tortillas and the best black beans ever. It was a huge dish. It tasted just as good the next day. My boyfriend ordered the chiles rellenos which he really enjoyed. For a vegetarian dish, it was amazing. I tried one of their carne asada tacos which I thought was just okay - it was a little dry so I think I would definitely stick with their main dishes next time. I had their delicious margaritas too.  We loved this place so much that we came back a few days later for brunch. Definitely get the chilaquiles and the barbacoa hash. They are both amazing dishes. My sister ordered the french toast. It is not your typical french toast. It had coconut which I am not a fan of but I was surprised at how delicious it was. My sister's boyfriend ordered the burrito which he loved as well.   If I could give half stars, I would definitely gives this place 4.5. The service was great. Everyone was wonderful and attentive despite the busyness. The prices are great and worth it. We will definitely be back!",

A large party of about 6-8 couples let their children run around in the game area throwing bean bags at each other. Then they took cushions of the patio furniture and had pillow fights with each other. Meanwhile the guy playing guitar and singing put up with these kids running close to his equipment. When we complained to the hostess she told a man who said to the kids \"I don't know about the pillow throwing guys\". It was a playground and the parents ignored their kids. We saw a table of 2 next to the kids that got up and left before their order was taken.   Our server was attentive and very nice, the drinks were good, the food amazing. But because of the running screaming kids I will give only 1 star. It really ruined the ambience. Manager really should have put a stop to it.",

The first thing we found out is they \"charge\" you for chips and salsa!? This is the first of hundreds of Mexican food restaurants that I have eaten at that charge for chips and salsa. With the high prices of the food you would think you would at least get chips and salsa for free.  In regards to our food it was just decent but nothing spectacular. We ordered the chicken burrito and nacho's. My burrito was a very large portion size and decent. The nachos however were very soggy and had a large piece of fat mixed into it, disappointing. We did get an order of the churro's and they were amazing, some of the best ever.  Lastly, the service wasn't great. We asked for more water over and over, it took 10 minutes in between to get the water jug filled. Even asking for the simplest of things like a straw were difficult for our waitress. The management and hostess staff were very friendly, though. I wish the wait staff took a page from them.",

Its patio is very inviting and there is a guitarist that plays on the weekends during brunch.  We shared the guacamole appetizer with chips. Typical go-to right? Well it's got some zest with Serrano peppers and citrus with oranges, topped with cotija cheese, charred onions and pepitas.  I had the huevos rancheros with fried fresh tortillas mixed with fried beans and ranchero queso fresco cheese sauce, hominy rice, and cilantro. It was topped with over easy eggs. It was very filling and flavorful!  I had a little food envy with my hubby ordering the steak ranchero plate, which included top sirloin, poblanos, potatoes and over easy eggs served with tortillas and rice and beans. That plate was also very filling and not for the faint of heart.   Let me just say that their caramel (or whatever sweetness was!) stuffed churros were amazing!! You must order them. That's not a request!!   The sangrias, bloody marys, and cocktails are wonderful as well. We tried to fit in as much as we could during brunch (wink, wink). We had to stay hydrated with all of our brunching.   I like how this place isn't as snooty and presumptuous like a lot of places are in old Scottsdale. It's very welcoming, inviting, and so stylish in its own right. That's the beauty of being located near the end of Central Avenue.",

They have such a gorgeous patio that is partially covered and has a cool atmosphere. The drinks are cheap and tasty. My friend had the mimosa, which she loved-more booze than oj-perfection. I had the bloody and it was spicy! Spicy good though, I love when places aren't afraid of a little heat.   To eat, we split the chilaquielas. The chips are super crispy and don't wilt quickly. The sauce and meat was delicious, just enough heat and just enough creaminess to cut it. I will definitely be back, I can't wait to try the other dishes!!",

Plenty of space indoors or out and a large bar to boot.   Service was great - quick and attentive. Drinks arrived to our table fast and with a smile. My wife had the prickly pear cider (awesome) and I got the house red. Dinner arrived and looked fantastic! I ordered the Carne Asada and my wife, the barbacoa plate. The asada was grilled to perfection, nice sear on the outside and pink in the middle, side of mex corn on the cob, beans, guac were all on point. The barbacoa was tender and had a rich flavor with plenty of sauce. We even got a churro stuffed with dolce de leche to top off the meal.   Overall -the food was dynamite. Street parking was only issue - but who cares? We will be back with the family for round two!",

    "text": "This is my new favorite spot and I am in love with this place. It is located where Corbin's used to be (which was one of my favorite breakfast places) but the place has been completely remodeled and has a huge backyard style patio. The patio is fantastic with a lot of space and feels very comfortable.   We arrived on a Sunday during Happy Hour. The place didn't seem too busy and we sat on the patio. Our waiter was super friendly, helpful, and quick. He helped describe some menu items, offer advice on the drinks, and was really great.   After browsing the menu, we decided on getting the guacamole/salsa appetizer and the elote. The guac and salsa were really good. Both were slightly spicy and everyone enjoyed them. The elote was what my husband was craving and he really enjoyed it. Both my sister-in-law and I liked it as well.  I ordered the carne asada and el pastor tacos to try. The carne asada were the winners. My sister-in-law also ordered the carne asada and agreed. The el pastor were flavorful but the meat was super fatty and not great. I expected more from the el pastor but the carne asada made up for it and I will definitely order those again.  My husband ordered the fish tacos - two grilled and one deep fried. The deep fried were juicier and more moist than the grilled, but the grilled had a lot more flavor. Thus it's a toss up. He said he would order them again and they were both good.  To drink, I ordered the paloma and my husband ordered the mezcolada. These were the two drinks I wanted to try and I had a hard time deciding between the two. The paloma was good - it was refreshing and well made. However, the mezcolda was amazing. It was super smokey with a hint of sweet. I would order this again and highly recommend it.  Since we checked in on Yelp, we received a free order of the churros. These were really good. They had a dulce de leche/caramel filling and came with a whipped cream/chocolate sauce. I personally don't think they needed the dipping sauce since they were already so sweet with the filling. However, everyone enjoyed them.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place. I know we will be back every chance we get!",

We ordered the queso flameado which was tasty but flameado to me is stringy cheese that you eat in a tortilla. This was a small dish of queso with chips for $9. Kinda a rip off.   Entrees: seafood enchiladas, carne asada, barbacoa, chile relleno, bean burrito, cheese quesadilla, and posole.   The barbacoa was tasty but I didn't like the stringy pieces of meat. The carne asasa was not seasoned for me. It was on the bland side.   The kids meals were cheese quesadillas and a bean and cheese burrito. They were humongous and expensive.  Please consider making a smaller portion for kids that doesn't cost the same as an adult meal. (See receipt photo).   The service was wonderful and there is a Yelp checkin offer for free churros.",

I ate about one fifth of it and couldn't do any more. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  He only ate about one third as the flavors were not good...poor quality chorizo?  Served with a little shredded lettuce on the side and chopped tomatoes with a bad tasting sauce on the tomatoes.  The portions were big...we would rather have quality over quantity.

First walking up to the restaurant I noticed the cooks horsing around and smoking in the little fenced in area near the entrance, should have taken a hint and left then.  But instead walked in and checked in with the host.  Told it would be a fifteen minute wait, no worries went to the bar.  25 minutes go by and no table but noticed plenty of empty seats.  Asked the bar tender to check on our table and turned out the host forgot about us.  Went to the table ordered guacamole and chips.  Chips were not good and the refrigerated, bland, and cold guacamole was not good either.  Salsa was the same, refrigerator temp and bland.  Fish tacos and carne asada tacos for dinner.  Fish tacos were awful, rice was bland and white and not Mexican rice.  Carne asada had good meat, but was not ranchero, was more like cubes cut from a steak.  This place has an identity problem and clearly not authentic Mexican food.  Would not return, complete waste of money.",

In particular, the tortilla soup is really good - lots of chicken in it and just the right amount of spice.  I ordered street tacos off the happy hour menu and they were delicious.  The corn appetizer is unique and delicious, too.  There are so many restaurants with great food and we go to many of them.  The food at this restaurant seems to me to be a bit above the others.

We made it in time for happy hour (Mon-Fri, 3-6p) and were able to get so much food for a great price! :)   For appetizers we got the Guacamole and Queso Fundido, both were so good! The guacamole is interesting because it has pepitas and oranges - which is actually really good. I especially loved the cojita cheese on top, and you get a ton! The queso was amazing, too. Whatever cheese they use is delicious!  My fiance also had a couple of the Margarita En La Casas which he thought were really good, and strong.  Next we ordered one of each taco on the happy hour menu: Pork Pastor, Carne Asada, and Pollo Asado. These were all good! The Pollo Asado is good if you like a lot of toppings, and the Carne Asada is better for someone like my fiance who likes just the basics on a taco.   Next was my favorite part of the whole meal, the dessert! We got an order of the churros (free when you check in on Yelp! :)) and they were to die for lol. Probably the best churros I've ever had. Beware though the filling is hot af and my mouth still hurts two days later haha.   The atmosphere and service at Ladera is great as well! Can't wait to go back sometime, I can guarantee we will just for churros!",

We ended up ordering their house margaritas with serrano pepper bitters and it was so flavorful without being overly spicy. We also ordered their appetizers. Highly recommend the queso fundido, salsa, elote and guacamole ( Listed in descending order of what we liked). For dessert, we ordered the churros and we were not disappointed! Definitely a good way to end the meal.  Overall the service was great and our server was very attentive. I would definitely go back to try their entrees and other drinks.",

And I'm super happy about the parking lot, which is well lit and easily walkable. (I HATE forced valet and I'm so glad they didn't take that route!)  Here's what I thought about the items we had on our happy hour: ~ trio of salsas ($5) all were heavy on the lime; we liked the variety and the chips ~ elote ($5) seemed equivalent to 1 ear of corn, cut into thirds, which help with sharing. The aoli was more apparent than the cojita -- messy but good flavor. ~ green chile pork  ($7) delicious - not enough tortillas! It was very soupy so it was hard to stretch the tortillas by packing them with the chile. Fortunately, the chips from the salsa trio were able to get the job done!  ~ carnitas tacos ($7) the shredded pork melted in your mouth! Great flavor!  ~ carne asada tacos ($7) excellent quality steak, still pink, super tender! A personal favorite! ~ El Santo ($5): think margarita meets a whiskey sour. Would definitely get this again!   We didn't get the nachos but I'm already planning my return -- they looked great!  The cocktail menu had a lot of drinks on it that would make a good nightcap.   The guys did it again with this upscale neighborhood tavern! So grateful to have them in the neighborhood!!",

Outdoor patio with romantic lighting, and the inside is just as cozy.  The staff is friendly and the bartenders do a great job.  I was excited to get the margarita with a full paleta inside, but was disheartened to find out they use the store bought Outshine popsicles you can get at the grocery store. They should definitely partner with a local Paleta maker like Paletas Betty. They should be able to find a good vendor, even if it's the Mexican brands found at Food City.  The elote was dry and not seasonal, but the toppings that made it elote were absolutely delicious!   The Cochinita Pibil and Barbacoa were outstanding and well seasoned. The tortillas were definitely not house-made which is a huge bummer, especially in Phoenix.",

The Santos drink was money but they fit every single bit of ice they could in the short glass.  Maybe got 4 or 5 sips out of it and it was gone.  The tacos were bunk.  Rotisserie chicken tacos (bleh) and flank steak carne asada will never substitute for the real thing.  C'mon people we are in freakin Sunnyslope there are carnicerias on every other corner. Step up your game!  The elote was also whack.  Lacked flavor and was very plain.  The michelada was alright.  It started really good but went down hill after I added more Tecate to it.  The service was bad.  For some reason our waitress was not feeling us.  I'm not sure why.  She was the only one on the patio and from what I could tell was friendly with the other guests.  From the jump she didn't seem to like us.  We had to ask for chips three times.  Took forever to ask us for our drinks.  Not friendly or kind.  Luckily for her I wasn't in charge of the tipping.  Would never come back and never recommend.  Way too many places near here that put out amazing food with a smile.",

I usually sit at the bar and the service is always great. My wife and I even got an entire lesson on Tequila, of which they have many. It was like going to a wine tasting but with Tequila! The patio is nice and relaxing with a roaring fire and you can even throw bags!!! The only dings I can come up with is that the cafe lights over the area where you throw bags makes it hard to play, and they charge for salsa. But, who goes to a Mexican place to throw bags, and the salsa is actually worth the charge.   Start with a tour of their tacos. Pastor is my favorite. The machaca enchiladas are also amazing.   All in all...it's a great place to pop in for some tacos and beer, or a nice relaxing evening of sipping tequila. The area is really coming into its own.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try Ladera for a while. We love the Vig - one of their sister restaurants and we had a gift certificate so two great excuses to go out. The decor and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. We made a 5:30 reservation and they were totally cool when I texted them and asked to move it to 6:00. We sat outside beside the fireplace.  Our server was a bit confused about the IPA options when my husband asked - he said they had three but then couldn't remember what they were. He brought one to the table and then my husband noticed that there were other options not even mentioned. I had a cocktail which was very nice.  For an appetizer we ordered green chile with chips. The chips were housemade and tasty but the green chile was super watery with big chunks of potato in it. I'm sure some people like this but it's not my style. My husband ordered the taco platter and I ordered the chile relleno based on our servers recommendation. And then... we waited. After being seated at 6, it was about 7:20 when our food was actually delivered. The server kept coming back and saying, \"what? your food isn't here?\". I know they were busy but there was not a lot of accountability there. When we did get our meal, we had two distinct experiences. My husband's tacos were cold having sat for a long time before they were delivered but my relleno was top notch - very good. The manager was alerted to the fact that we'd waited almost an hour and a half to eat and he was genuinedly apologetic and removed our food from the bill - a class act. I would like to say that I will give Ladera another try but the reality is that there are so many fantastic restaurants in Phoenix now, that it may be a long time before I make it back.",

Yummy!  The patio is pretty spacious and we have brought our baby here at least 3 times with no problem!",

There was a mix-up with our reservation and the manager was apologetics and offered us a round of free drinks.  Appetizers and main dishes were prepared with care, perfectly seasoned and beautiful presentation. Home made tortillas hot and fresh, nice margaritas. The roasted corn is to die for so is everything else. I am puzzled by the negative reviews at this place. If you are in Phoenix and want some great food this is the place, reservations are a must in the weekends.",

Let's start with the chips, crispy and not too greasy or salty. The salsas were also very good, we tried 4 different kinds- the house salsa and then an order of the separate salsa on the menu. The house salsa is really good on its own, you don't even need to splurge on the other salsa; unless you love chips and salsa like we do, then it's a must! The guac was also good. For the entree, I got the breakfast burrito with chorizo and WOW! It was a large portion size, after pigging out on chips I could've split an entree with someone, but it was so good. Warm, flavorful and anything you could want with a breakfast burrito! We also got the $4 mimosas, because brunch! We asked her to do just a splash of OJ, and she made them perfectly. Finally, we redeemed our check in offer for the churros, and those were delicious too! Do yourself a favor and come dine here. I definitely want to come back and try dinner.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner.  We explored the whole menu and there was some good and some bad.    First, I wish it hadn't been so hot because sitting outside is definitely better than inside in terms of decor/vibe/ambience.  The inside was nice, but outside is better.   Second, service was excellent and food came out fast.     Now for the food.  Started with the 3 salsas and the roasted corn (chose off the cob). Chips were good and addictive (as expected), but none of the salsas was special.  I would pass. The corn was good, but should have been served hot.  It was lukewarm. Also could have used a bit more salt.    Next we went for the ceviche.  All of the elements on this were very good, but it felt like it was missing something.  The white fish was excellent in this.    Then we turned to the tacos: pastor and the other pork, fish (crispy and not), and cactus.  Best of the bunch were the pastor and the crispy fish tacos.    We're stuffed at this point, but waitress recommended the enchiladas with the crab meat.  I'm glad we got this because the enchiladas were delicious.  If you like crab, the you should definitely get this.   We ended with coffee and the churros (churros courtesy of the yelp check in).  Coffee was notably delicious and those churros were outstanding with hot caramel inside and a yummy whipped cream to dip into.    We also ordered the OG and the Cadillac marg.  They were a bit strong to start, but mellowed out.  Not good enough to get us to order a second round unfortunately.    I'd come back, but would focus on the highlights and try a couple new items.",

The restaurant has a great outdoor seating area and indoor seating was also worthy, given the large, French doors were wide open.  Service was prompt, not obnoxiously hovering, and very helpful.  We ate ceviche, street corn, and since it was a Tuesday - tacos! (Duh) The ceviche was top notch. It was garnished with jalapenos. That was fine for us, but you may ask to refrain from that if that's too spicy for you. The street corn was creamy and delish. The tacos came as a variety and all were very good (short ribs, roasted chicken, fried fish, not fried fish, skirt steak, etc).  Our check-in on Yelp got us a free order of churros, which were great. Filled with dulce de leche and swimming in sugar, with a ramekin of chocolate and cream.  I drank a house margarita and it was well made.  Great restaurant! I wish we had one in Oregon. :)",

Was literally bland and white in color. Sprinkled some cilantro over it..   Tacos were ok, but at the price point of 14 dollars, I think it's about 4 dollars over price wise. My reasoning is - IMO the tacos were about 2 dollars good. ( size and taste considered) possibly 3. The rice was an oversight and just really had no place on the plate being it was bland. So ..  For the price.. it just isnt worth returning. IMO",

It's also located right off the central but you can't hear much traffic which is nice.   We got the chips, salsa and guac to start. The portions were large and the guac was cold and tasted fresh. They had happy hour and our server was awesome and gave me veggie tacos for happy hour pricing. These were the best veggie tacos I have ever had, and large- I could not finish them! So many veggies. My boyfriend got the chicken tacos and he really enjoyed them as well. I got the strawberry margarita which was pretty strong, but delicious. They used fresh strawberries. My boyfriend got the house margarita which he also enjoyed. The churro/ice cream dessert was out of this world. The ice cream was fried and with the cinnamon and sugar churros, oh man!

You get 5 tacos and a margarita for $15!!  For me, that's kind of a big deal because I'm not use to that type of stuff in Cincinnati.  It was also my bday as well so they gave me a free shot and some churros!! The atmosphere was amazing and the outside area is so nice. They have a lounge like area with a fire pit and flowers/plants all around. So pretty!  Now the good part- the tacos are so awesome!! I got the shrimp and fish tacos and the meat was tender and they had great flavor. Unfortunately- I didn't take a picture because I was so juicy I ate them before I could even remember to take the pic ..... so my apologies about that!!  The staff was so nice and friendly. Overall, amazing place and you should definitely try it out!!",

    "text": "What a beautiful space with a lovely courtyard - perfect for dining during the pleasant Arizona months! They do a great job serving up elevated Latin fare in a modernized setting (that still boast beautiful cultural flair).  We took some of our family members here (including one three-year-old) and everyone enjoyed their food as well as the ambiance. Unfortunately it was too hot to sit outdoors on our visit, so we enjoyed the dining area.  Husband and MIL had seafood enchiladas - plentiful portions and both said they would order them again. Husband has a seasoned palate when it comes to seafood enchiladas so I didn't take that review lightly. I will order them next time!  Street tacos were small, but mighty in taste and were loaded with the chosen protein/veggies. With the sides, three tacos are plenty for one person. Barbacoa was moist and tender and more savory than sweet (which I prefer) - definitely enough for 2! Craft drinks were delicious and I was pleased so see their own spin on the ingredient compositions.  Don't miss this place!",

There were certainly some factors that I was unaware of that led to the poor service. In any event we decided to give it a try again last night. No surprise, the food was fantastic. Absolutely everything we had was superb. The service too was fantastic. A well oiled machine last night. Even through the crowd Nicole had a chance to stop by and chat. Super nice person. Great food. Great service.  Thank you Nicole.  Your restaurant will be a regular stop for us.   Ok. Second time here. Food is really good. Service is the worst ever. Unfortunately I had the same waitress both times. Forgot drinks BOTH times. Appetizers came with my meal.   Both times it took 15 minutes to get my drinks. Both times I got my drinks only because I went to get them.   My God. What nonsense",

Restaurant very clean and a modern take on the Latin vibe.  My girlfriend and I went for Happy Hour to try out a new place and was pleasantly surprised, as we all know I am bit of a Mexican good snob.  We tried to Guacamole which was refreshing and delightful, the corn aka Elote was amazing.  We also split a taco plate I liked the Carne Taco as it wasnt over seasoned as some locations try to do.   Side note; be cautious when outside on the patio on this day it was a bit windy and an umbrella feel over on to our table, the restaurant did bring us out new dishes and drinks no harm no foul.",

We ordered the margarita, chips and salsa trio, elote, barbacoa, cochina pibil, and free churros for checking in!   Margarita- so good! Not super sweet, enough tequila, only $5 for happy hour.  Chips and salsa- chips were good, nothing amazing. The salsa was realllly spicy. Almost too spicy for us to even eat. The red salsa was the best one!   Elote- omg so great. I love elote and this was the best I've ever had.  Barbacoa- huge portion of delicious meat served with corn tortillas. The barbacoa was so tender, juicy, and flavorful.   Cochina pibil- same thing as the barbacoa- served the same way and equally delicious though I think I liked the barbacoa a little more.   Churros- mmmmm!! They were filled with caramel or something and came with this super fluffy chocolatey whipped cream. Really good! I would definitely order these again.   The waitress was great and the manager came by a few times to make sure we had what we needed. The atmosphere was really nice. I can't wait until it's cooler so we can enjoy their adorable patio!",

The carne asada tacos were quite good but even better were the crispy fish tacos, and the star of the taco plate was the shrimp.   The carne asada entree was also exceptional, particularly when plated with the elote.  I'd also recommend the guacamole and loved the fact that they continued to refill the salsa roja and chips when requested.   The only disappointment were the frioles de fiesta which were too soupy to eat.  Really a hidden gem in this quiet neighborhood.  If they had a 4 1/2 star option I'd round up!",

Everyone of us were satisfied with our order. Let's talk about ambiance. We were really impressed with it's spacious setting and structural appealing, inside and outside. In particular, the patios has a play-area (like a kids-zone), then a \"formal\" dining area with a lovely fireplace. We are especially glad to have Ladera in our neighborhood...bringing up the trendiness and new-concept of dining.  We highly recommend this place, and we will come back very soon.

I will hands down say that Ladera Taverna will become part of a regular weekly rotation.  In terms of value, taste, ambiance and service, I can't say enough about my experience here!    The patio is absolutely gorgeous and well suited for those Sunday morning conversations with friends.  A number of us started off with the $4 sangria special; the drinks were huge compared to a lot of other brunch spots where you pay $6 for little more than a tall shot glass.  For the same $4 you can also order a mimosa, house margarita, bloody mary or michelada.  The sangria was tasty without being too sweet (several of us ordered a second round which means my friends must have liked them too!)  As for the food--yummy is the only way to describe my Chilaquiles Rojas, and I'll be the first to admit I'm usually a straight up bacon and eggs kinda guy.  The black bean accompaniment was the best I've ever tasted. I would order this again and again again!  As for the Barbacoa Hash, two friends got that and were quite pleased.  Finally--our servers were friendly and attentive.  If I could give Ladera Taverna's brunch a 6 or 7-star rating I would!",

Their parking lot is a little bit odd--you have to walk from a lot away, but hey, after all the food you eat, walking may be just what's needed!  Please do try their chili rellano's if you want a healthy rendition--not a lot of cheese, but plenty of favorable vegetables wrapped in a hatch chili.  Yum!

    "text": "In Phoenix, options for authentic Mexican food are EVERYWHERE, but this place was memorable to me on so many levels.  First things first, the food and drink options.   My husband and I sat at the bar for Happy Hour and indulged in some Elotes (which is just yellow corn) but fancy and flavorful. You can request either on the cob or shaved. We opted for shaved which had a drawback: all the flavors while merged together, get lost in the water coming off the corn. If you got this dish on the cob you would have concentrate bites of flavor.  It comes with chipotle aioli, chili powder and cotija cheese. It might have been spicy or had a kick if left on the cob but I got the gist of it and would get it again. Shaved makes it easier to scoop onto tacos!  Next we got some tacos.  2 per order: Carne Asada and Cochinita Pibil (Braised Pork).  Very good although the tortilla (small) didn't really do anything for me outside of holding the delicious meat.   For a drink, I went straight for Gin, specifically the Porque No? Which is made with fords gin, st. George chareau aloe, mint and kiwi.  So REFRESHING! All parts were in harmony. I had 2.  A final comment on this place. The bartenders are very friendly and full of information if you're looking for things to do around town. Thanks for a great time!",

    "text": "On a Saturday afternoon my lady and I were in search of a patio and margaritas. After a quick search of yelp, we settled on Ladera. Arriving at the restaurant, we were surprised to not see any real parking lot. Maybe this changes during busier times, where they open the vacant lot next door to them. On this day however, street parking was available. Walking in, Ladera is gorgeous. The shaded patio with the fireplace; the reclaimed wood; all of it sets the tone for a wonderful experience. Our host quickly came up and greeted us, warmly bringing us to our seat, and brought us water. And then we waited...and waited. I didn't have my stop watch running but I would venture in the neighborhood of 10 minutes for anyone else to acknowledge us. Eventually, our server came and took our beverage order, as well a couple appetizers. Both of which came out fairly quickly. My Paloma was wonderful, my date's margarita was dreadful. When our server came back she graciously took the drink away, later she would inform us that the manager had tried the drink and had agreed that it was incorrect and that it would be taken off of our bill. For the food, we had the street corn, the salsa trio, and a quesadilla; all of which were tasty. However, if we get the street corn again, I'll ask for the \"on the cob\" preparation. I'm pretty sure they used frozen bag corn for the, \"shaved,\" version. All in all, we had a fine experience. The environment was gorgeous, the food was tasty. Our service was slower than I expected and I was surprised by the lack of management presence in the dining room. We'll probably be back at some point, but I don't think anytime too soon.",

Chips and salsa trio are alacarte. The chip are fresh and warm, but, the salsa disappointing. Even the spicy was bland and quite mild. The green salsa was downright boring and jar like. The chili Releno was really small, more like an appitizer than an entree. We had the Cobb salad which was quite good with really fresh ingredients. However, the dressing was boring, too. It needed some zip including some salt, which is not served at the table. We also had the Ceasar steak salad which was very good. The steak was excellently prepared, but, the salad was extremely overdressed, almost drowned. The waitstaff was friendly and efficient. All i can say was everthing was o.k., nothing special or notewofthy. We certainly expected better. P.S. the mens bathroom was filthy. Papertowels overflowing on the floor and even vomit on the floor(at least that is what I think it was). They need staff to regularly check these...",

Our waiter was awful.  He gave one lunch and one dinner menu, which wasn't apparent at the time and I was told I couldn't order what I finally picked.  I say finally because it took forever just to look up the translation of each food item from Spanish to English.  It was more than your ordinary Spanish.  Yes, our waiter was gone that long.  The food was delicious, but over priced for the little there was of it.  Oh, did I mention that we never did get our appetizer, either.  The music was non stop blaring horns, which made conversation nearly impossible.  I hope it improves, drastically.",

Being it's in our neighborhood and inviting ANY upscale business in the area, I was beyond elated to watch the birth of this restaurant. We waited months and months for the place to open, ending up making it in on our anniversary with my wife. The place is GORGEOUS.  Worth going just for the ambiance. The service was pretty good. Our server was really friendly and kind. The drinks were top notch and we'll be back for those alone. The food, meh. 16$ for some pork with super dry, but soggy, and stale (I know it sounds weird. Couldn't figure it out myself) but over all inedible tortillas. Not very plant based friendly (which is fine, can't win them all) but left my wife with very minimal options. The chips served with the guacamole were obviously not made in house and were relatively stale.  10$ for that (though the salsa that accompanied it was amazing).  Over all, a good date night place for drinks and maybe an appetizer. But we spent a lot of money for pretty subpar food.  I want this business to thrive, it's a selfish endeavor for I want our neighborhood to grow. I hope the business can as well.",

The bar is great, and a tequila stock that will either make one happy, or shudder- depending on if you like tequila :) I've been able to sample a few menu items and drinks. The menu prices are a little heavy, but that looks to be the norm these days. The tacos are outstanding, and the nachos (Slope-style, w mole) are a must-have. The quesadilla is so-so. I've had a couple of other items, and while they do t stand out- I DO remember thinking, very good. The drinks are very good too, good draft selections, and the mixed drinks are muy beuno.

For happy hour/dinner we had drinks (all were good) the guacamole/salsa and chips(yummy, the salsa was a bit spicy but good quality) then we had the stew w an egg(it was also very good). My husband got the carne asada tacos (great) and I got the pork entree(also so good!). Overall we're thrilled about our experience with ladera and are thrilled for our neighborhood addition! Will be back many times!",

I really recommend trying out this place and we're definitely coming back. **just a side note: The taco+burro on the menu doesn't mean you get both, it means choose between taco or burro.",

    "text": "So we just had an early dinner here, and I must say Matt our server/bartender was amazing. He made sure we were taken care of the whole time. He kept our drinks full and our belly's full. Thank you sir. I had the 5 tacos, one of each, with the exception of the shrimp taco the rest off them needed a little more flavor and a little dry. If the tacos weren't so dry I would give this place a 5 star review. Talking to my partner during dinner, the drinks and atmosphere here are amazing. The food can be worked, and if I had to choose between this place and my other favorite mexican place, I would go to my favorite place for food, which has some flavorful food. The drinks, hands down I would come here for. Other than that, I'm happy to give them 4 stars. Please if management is reading these reviews, add some flavor to the chicken tacos, carne asada tacos, al pastor tacos, and work on the fish tacos, I tasted more batter than actual fish. Will be back for sure for some guacamole/chips & drinks.",

Ask for the pink cocktail that tastes like Otter Pops in the side. Chips and salsa were wonderful, as was the guac.  Our waitress, the one who enjoys chasing tequila with pickle juice, was one of the best I've had in months. Thanks dear!   The patio was perfect. The DJ playing on Sunday afternoon had the vibe down to a science and the big roaring fireplace was a fabulous touch.   I'm so happy we went! See you all soon!",

My husband ordered the carne asada, and the meat was dry and tough. I ordered the enchiladas, and they were ok - lacked a bit in flavor and thought they skimped on the filling. I tasted a whole lot of tortilla and sauce. Needless to say, we may come back for drinks to start a night but we won't be having a full meal there again - especially with those prices.",

The issues I had was with the ordering of the Carne Asada burrito. Station at the bar I asked the bartender if there was a lot of beans in the burrito. I always ask this because I believe that an over serving of beans can take away from the taste of the meat. Let's be honest the reason we order Carne Asada is to taste the Carne Asada. I was told \"no\" that there was not much beans. This was completely False because the burrito came packed with black beans. They absolutely drowned out the meat flavor which was super disappointing! I was not a big fan of their Churros desert either because it was filled. Nothing to really complain about there though because this item was complementary.",

I wouldn't have minded more potatoes to go with it. My only complaint is that the service is kind of slow and it's not that busy.

This was our 3rd time coming here but the first time we were too lat to get parking which is a couple of blocks away unless you want to Valet which we do not.   The next time we got there for brunch and last night early enough for happy happy hour.   Parking wasn't much of a problem those last two times but it is a walk, even for handicap parking.  There is a parking lot right next to the restaurant but they don't own it so you can't park there.  We were early enough to take advantage of the happy hour menu which has some nice options.  We got the guacamole and Cochinita Pibil tacos which were both good, especially the tacos.  The guac was pretty good but they could leave out the caramelized orange for me.  The chicken mole was really good, light smoke taste cooked on a rotisserie.  The white meat was a little dry which was my only complaint about that dish. You also get a little bowl of charro black beans cooked with chorizo and bacon!  We also got the pan seared cod & mussels  with chorizo in a nice broth which helped the chicken that was a tad dry.  Overall an excellent dish.    When I was there for brunch I got to try the Barbacoa Hash which I also enjoyed.  Despite being a lot of potatoes in there I didn't leave hungry but we also go the guac and Ceviche.  The Ceviche was also really good.    I have to give them kudos for having a dark beer!  They have a really nice nut brown ale which is hard to find these days.  Usually can't get anything darker than an amber.  Wish they had a porter or a stout but the nut brown is good.    Both times we sat at the bar and service was not a problem. The only minor issue was the setting sun was right in our eyes for a while.  They have a very nice outdoor seating which I'd like to try next time I go there.  Plenty of heaters and a nice, big fireplace to keep you warm on a cool evening like last night.",

We had chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips seemed very fresh and the guacamole was tasty, but the salsa was surprisingly what caught our attention. It was delicious! I had the cochinita pibil, which was very good and generously portioned. The side of elote was sooooo good. If you go there and your dish doesn't include elote, I would recommend getting it as an app. We absolutely want to go back!",

    "text": "Ladera is a modern Mexican bar and dinning experience, tucked away on the less congested north end of Central Avenue. From the moment you pull up and see the beautifully designed, yet modest, exterior you know you're in for a treat.  This past Sunday I had the pleasure of enjoying a crisp Mimosa, their Triple Salsa Chips, and the ever so rare Coco Leche French Toast ... all while sitting in their grand patio as the live tunes of their local guitarist, Miguel, blessed the atmosphere with the sounds of his guitar.  The Mimosa: Traditional as far as Mimosas go. With so much attention to detail, I do wish they added just a bit of flare to this morning cocktail. Perhaps a freshly sliced orange would have taken it to the next level, for me. But overall, it's what you would expect a Mimosa to taste like :)  Trio De Salsas: Embrace the culinary side of Mexico with this great appetizer! You won't be disappointed. They serve their salsas with thin corn chips that aren't overly salted, like in so many other restaurants. They let their salsas do the talking. This treat is made up of three salsa bowls; their Salsa Roja, their Salsa Verde, and their Chile de Arbol. Each one a joy to toss around in your mouth while you wait for your main dish. And mine ... was something very different. Their salsa roja was fresh, slightly chunky, and wasn't overly spicy. Just enough to make your mouth sweat. Their salsa verde was a bit bright. Fun to dip and even better tasting then most salsa verdes I've had elsewhere. And finally, my fav, their Chile de Arbol. Oh man, the flavors were on point. One taste of this, and instantly I was taken back to my grandmothers house in Monterrey. Yummmm!  Coco Leche French Toast: Made up of cajetea (dulce de leche), toasted coconut, and coconut streusel. This was a rare treat. The sliced bread weren't too thick or too heavily sweetened, but rather nicely balanced. A great blend of flavors going on that take French toast to another level. Epic!  Okay, okay. I know you guys might be thinking, \"Who reviews a Mimosa and French Toast at a Mexican restaurant?!?\" Well ... to keep it simple ... this guy! Lol. I do plan on revisiting this lush gem of modern Mexican cuisine tucked away on the far north end of Central. Who knows, we may just bump into each other on my next adventure out to Ladera ;)  Salud!",

The patio is darling and we came right after Thanksgiving - I pity the employee who had to hang all those ornaments from the ceiling (looks fab though!).    Drinks were fantastic and the food was delicious.  I had the fish tacos and they magical - magical in the sense that they are more than the sum of their parts.  I can see the physical ingredients but they must have tossed fairy dust on it because I wanted ten more (even though I was so very full).    The queso was delicious and they were kind enough to make a second order with less spice for my mom.  I had a fried banana chocolate chip ice cream deal for dessert and it was bizarrely delicious.    Service was great and my parents have declared we MUST go there when they're in town again.",

    "text": "Came here for an old friend's birthday celebration. First of, their parking is half a block away so you have to walk a bit. Because of the size of the party we were seated outside; misters on everything got wet, misters off it was hot and now also humid. Service was extremely slow, inattentive servers that didn't know what was ordered or who ordered it. They kept bringing items without knowing who had ordered them and some were for another table. My fiance and I ordered food at the same time. Mine got to the table, but was the wrong sauce. One of the supervisors took it back to change it. Once it was brought back, everyone else's food was served but not my fiance's. We asked the waiter for the nth time, and he said \"I hope your damn tacos are out\". 45 minutes after having ordered, finally got the tacos plate which is 5 small tacos for $15, relatively well served but flavorless. Don't bother with the shrimp tacos, there were only 2 small shrimps in it. My enchiladas were so salty that it left my mouth feeling almost numb and there was no flavor besides the salt. We waited for 20 minutes for our checks, and still had to send that back because one of my friends was charged for plates they didn't order. The service was so poor I wouldn't have left any tip, but because it was a large party, 18% was added automatically. Will never be back.",

    "text": "Phenomenal.   My boyfriend brought me here for a date night, and I fell in love with this restaurant. We came a little earlier in the evening so it wasn't busy, but as the evening progressed, it became evident that this restaurant was a local favourite. Service was excellent, and the food was incredible.   Food: Oh my goodness. The flavours, textures, and presentation were out of this world. We ordered a lot of food, and for the quality of the ingredients, the price was entirely worth it. For people who complain that Mexican food is too greasy for them, check this place out. Ladera serves high-quality Mexican dishes that will knock your socks off. We ended up with:   --Guacamole: Careful eating this delicious dish first. You won't be able to stop eating this and may end up being too full to eat anything else.  --Elotes: Mexican street corn. Toasty, creamy, and sweet. Delicious.  --Ceviche: SO fresh. The fish was inherently sweet. Well done Ladera. My only complaint would be the citrus seeds that I ended up chomping down on. A little bitter, but hey, I'm glad it's fresh.  --Cochinita Pabil: HOLY MOLY. This melt in your mouth slow roasted pork dish was incredible and a huge portion. Well worth the money. Get it.   Drinks: Marguerita with a Paleta (popsicle): This was such a cute idea. My drink wasn't mixed properly however, and I ended up with a few super salty sips. I wouldn't order this again.   Rob. W. got the Michelada: It's like a bloody mary with Mexican spices mixed with a beer. Tasty!   Service: Dijen. Without a doubt, our server Dijen was the highlight of the evening. He was the perfect blend of character, charisma, and genuine kindness. He was the most attentive server I have ever had, but was not overbearing. When our waters were low he would be immediately present, when our drinks were finished, he cleared them away. He was knowledgeable about the menu and made our night something special to remember. Thank you.   Ladera, you are my favourite restaurant in the Valley. Thank you for a wonderful night.",

The chips were one of my absolute favorites of all time! And I also loved the oranges on top of the guacamole. It was so different yet so yummy! My husband got the puerco en Chile verde. It was roasted pork with potatoes in sauce and a Sunnyside egg on top. Came with the chips on the side!!! It was so good!!! Basically a strew with chips to dip in. Who doesn't like that!? I got the ensalada de Cobb! It was so good! The chicken was so tender and had a great spice on it. And to top it all off we got the churro's for desert! They were absolutely delicious! The Mexican chocolate sauce with whipped cream and little pomegranate seeds on top was to die for!!! We will be back for sure! Next time on the patio, when it's cooler out! It looks beautiful!",

Amazing food & drinks and we got to meet the awesome chef Jose who is behind all the magic. The sangrias and micheladas are yummy. We got the chilaquiles, guac, mole enchiladas, and barbacoa hash (all really great).   Great customer service and prices are worth it. Can't wait to come back!",

Mimosas for $4 doesn't hurt either! Our server Matthew was super attentive and friendly! This will be one of our new hangouts due to the exceptional outdoor patio as well!! Beautifully appointed and a perfect place for gathering large groups!! Check them out!! Only challenge is parking, but they're working on that!! Worth the effort for Sure!!",

Mango and some sort of nut accompany this dish amazingly well. The appetizers were the ahi mango salad and the chicken tostadas. The salad was amazing. The mango was so crazy good with the ahi I can't even describe.  the mans chicken tostadas were fresh and loaded with goodness.  They alone could feed a person for sure.   Main courses. The green corn tamales were smothered in a nice pork and pico and cheese. The stuffed chili was so dang amazing. The use of the fresh veggies and the smokes taste of the chili oh my.   On to desert...I'm still to full to eat it but know we brought the flan and chirps he to enjoy. Our waiter was awesome and very knowledgeable of the menu.   This place is going on the rotation and note we won't be driving by all that often.",

The Gorditas with Barbacoa and the Posole soup made the meal - fresh chips and house-made guacamole were just as good and set the stage. Fresh, and very True to form - Mexica Cuisine. I felt like somebody in that kitchen really did their homework on the items, menu content and took the time to bring out the best of what \"Mexican Food\" offers,  not the same old nachos, half hearted tacos and flautas routine. Flawless execution if you ask me. Portions were huge and I left feeling like I had two dinners ...technically I did.   Service was great and the atmosphere is authentic and well done. Great ambiance and a terrace that makes you want to sit and chill awhile. Want to head back soon for brunch.   Very happy this place is nearby. A+",

We'd gotten their during \"brunch\" till 2pm and wasn't aware they'd have a different menu then I'd seen on their website. It was nice to find out they had drink specials on a Sunday but was looking forward to their regular menu.

(first for parties greater than 20, then 15, and finally we were told, not for our party of 8!!!). Pricing was not marked and we had to ask multiple times for the cost of drinks, so people who needed to leave, could at least leave cash. We were charged $30 for chips, salsa & guacamole, which they offered upfront, as if it was complimentary! We asked several times for more salsa and chips, which we never received.

Super music selection fit so well with the warm Hispanic flavored surroundings. We felt like we could easily have been in Mexico City. Looks like the parking issue is \"almost\" resolved with a lot next door. All in all one of the finer Phoenix eateries.",

What was a wasted outdoor area before is an AMAZING covered patio.  Their happy hour menu is affordable and tasty.  I had the taco sampler.  This way I know what I want to order the next time.  And the frijoles, laced with BACON, yum.  Our server, Haley, was helpful and fun.  The birthday dessert of fried bananas with ice cream was decadent, but not free as we were led to believe, but still worth the price.  We will be back...many times.",

Since I live in the area and want to see them do well, in spite of a below average initial experience, I  been twice now. Shrimp salad first round. And shrimp tacos the second round. Shrimp are soggy and chewy. WAYYYYYY too much cream on the tacos. Rice was clumpy and cold. The servers all seem like they have stage fright. Nobody confident or welcoming - across the board. I feel like they did an A game on decor and sent the C team in to run it. Come on Genuine - this place won't make it on looks alone.",

When we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant we originally planned to go to, we noticed the attire of the patrons was a bit casual for what we had planned. So we went over to Ladera and was seated right away. The restaurant is gorgeous! And the ambience was sexy. Cocktails and food was delicious. Some of the best salsa I've ever tasted. Tacos are great and the roasted corn is to die for. Will definitely be returning!",

We ordered happy hour Puerco tacos.  I wish the waitress would have explained it wasn't really tacos. It is a skillet of mediocre pork and potatoes with an unnecessary egg on top served with chips.  We waited and waited for our wine.   There are so many good things about Ladera.  It isn't the parking, it's the patio.  Live music on Thursday was a treat.  Thumbs up for Miguel.  I think it can be so much better.",

    "text": "Discovered that finding the best Mexican food can be done by searching for best margarita on yelp. It is 4 hours later and I am thinking of going back. The margaritas were great (coupe deville) as I was lucky someone else in our group ordered and shared it. I loved all of my drinks for all very different reasons, the (something) Aztec made me want more of the amazing creativity of the bartender. Next was the Porque No?, minty, refreshing and where did it go. The Telenovella was equally as good, and as expected spicy, sweet and should have lasted an hour, but when it was gone I wanted a \" to be continued\". At this point, I have not even written about the food, or service, which I do not think I will be able to do justice. The restaurant was immaculate, the servers were friendly, and attentive. Tony our server was impeccable and made sure our orders were correct (we had one member who gets ill if he eats cilantro). The 5 taco platter was amazing. The problem was that it made me want 12 more tacos. The shrimp taco was the best ever, and everyone at my table agreeed.Shrimp at a Mexican restaurant is usually awful and overlooked . I wish I hadn't shared it.  Seriously, I wish I hadn't shared. The carne asada was amazing, and had a smoky flavor. But can we talk about the shrimp again. Or the cocktails. Did I mention the quacamole, salsa or chips? I should have. Don't forget to get them or the puerco en chile verde. The crispy banana was heavenly. The manager stopped by at the end to check to see if everything was to our liking and he was a spitting image of his restaurant, meticulous, classy and joyful.",
