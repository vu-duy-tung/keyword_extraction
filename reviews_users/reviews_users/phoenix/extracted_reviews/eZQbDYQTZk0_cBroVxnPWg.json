Food was very generously portioned and absolutely delicious. I'm a New Yorker and I've been dying to find good Chinese food here. It wasn't just good, it was excellent. Very apparent all ingredients were fresh, and neatly presented, right down to the orange slice garnish on the chicken.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE...  I have ordered from them many times over the last few years and it has always been good. Tonite, i wanted some appetizers and soup. I placed the order online, and paid on line with my credit card. It took 45 minutes for soup, a pupu platter and crab puffs to arrive. The driver asked how I was going to pay and I told him I gave my credit card info online. He gave me the food and left. I immediately went to enjoy my food, and the apps were all lukewarm to cool. . The soup was the only thing hot. I was trying to enjoy what I could as it was rapidly cooling, and my phone rang. It was the restaurant calling back saying that my credit card had not gone thru and I needed to pay cash. I tried explaining that I had given all my info online, but they kept putting me on hold and eventually they hung up. After all that time, the apps were ice cold and inedible. Into the garbage they went. I looked at my online receipt, and sure enough, it did state the amount, the charge tip I entered, but it said cash.. WTF?? next thing, i have the driver back saying I needed to pay cash. I told him to have the manager call me. He didnt seem to understand what i was saying. I called the restaurant back, only to yelled at by the manager and basically told I was lying and the food was hot..  I ended up giving them my credit card number again, this time over the phone. I am not sure how much I am going to be charged, but no matter what it is, it was not worth the poor service and major attitude from the manager, not to mention the cold food. I understand that fried food doesnt travel great, but I do live less than two miles from the restaurant, so it might not be piping hot, but it shouldn't be COLD..  Do NOT order from them. Next time I will get in my car and drive to Chen and Wok on 7th st and Maryland for hot food and no attitude.",

Mind you, the fried appetizers are OK (egg rolls, crab puffs, fried scallops), but the entree dishes (Szechuan Beef, Scallops with Garlic Sauce, etc) are bland, spiceless and boring.There is very little meat / fish / protein and they are just loaded with fillers like celery, carrots, and green bell peppers. We couldn't even tell our orders apart, except for the meat in them. They all look alike with the same brown, corn starched sauce. The last order was probably the worst chinese food we've ever had.

Just like the legendary bird in which our city was named for, from the ashes of my belly, a new hunger has been born.  For those of you wanting some legit american style chinese food,  I strongly recommend the Sweet and Sour Beef dinner combo.  This combo comes with very generous portions of all of these below listed items:   S&S Beef, Fried Rice, Chicken Lo Mein, 1 egg roll, 2 crab puffs.  Yes, I said beef. No, I am not sharing.  You won't be disappointed, I leave this restaurant with a full belly and smile of contentment every visit.",

The delivery area is large and the packing is thoughtful!  That's right.  I always have leftovers and these kept.  I ordered egg foo young and it was divided into its three components.  Egg patties in one box, rice in another, with meat and veggies in a tupperware!  The other impressive thing... the driver figured out my apartment complex.  When I order delivery of any variety I always explain the gate system and leave my code for the driver so I can buzz them in.  And 9 times out of ten a driver calls me and asks me to come down and get my food.  GRRRRR.  Delivery means to my door and nothing less. My door is nowhere near the gates.  Siu Wok gets it done right!  Now if only they were open at 10pm on Sundays.",

We over looked her behavior and decided to order anyway because we had received good service in the past and everyone is entitled to a bad day.   To our surprise some of the order was wrong.   The pork noodle soup came with chicken instead of pork.  Not what we ordered but we could live with other white meat.    We also ordered Kung Pao Chicken one with peanuts and one without (the one supposedly without nuts was clearly marked \"NO PEANUTS\").  Thank God the person that she was sharing the Kung Pao Chicken with who is deathly allergic to nuts did not fix her plate first (Peanut allergies can be life threatening).    We called Siu Wok to complain, I again had the pleasure of speaking with Ronnie and her poor customer service skill.  First she said there was no way the Kung Pao Chicken had peanuts because they where cooked in two different pans. This of course was not the case.   Ronnie did not offer any solutions.  I had to request she replace our order with the correct food.  Sadly, when the delivery guy came back with our corrected order his attitude was just as bad as Ronnie's.  I asked to speak with Ronnie's manager.  I am still waiting on that call.    All I have to say is eating at Sui Woks can be deadly.  We will never order from there again.",

The Pepper Steak was really yummy and perfectly spicy. The Kung Pao Steak was quite good as well as the Szechuan Chicken. (I'm noticing a spicy trend here).   The lunch specials are served with fried rice, an egg roll and (2) crab puffs. The only thing that annoyed me was the \"crab\" puffs. OK,  not only is there NO crab in them, there isn't even a hint of \"Krab\" in them.... you dig?? Call them what they are...... cream cheese puffs, thank you. I'll eat them anyway..... no need for deception.   Yesterday I had the Teriyaki Chicken for lunch. I questioned it immediately because it looked *interesting*. I actually joked to my lunch date about what I was eating and that I didn't believe it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some \"ghetto backyard, dove massacre\"... alas I was wrong. I'm just not used to eating only dark meat chicken and let me tell you, it was fucking delicious.   In closing: good cheap eats cream cheese treats bomb dark meats  now if only they had crushed ice.....",

    "text": "A new standard for bad Chinese food.  First time. Flier on my door said \"All Dishes Cooked Fresh per Order\". Ordered luch special Teriyaki Chicken white rice instead of fried rice, dine in. Lunch special is $6.95, soda $1.50.  Steamed rice was OK. Falls apart, more like Uncle Ben's than I would like. Surprisingly very little rice is given.  Huge amount of chicken.  Cooked fresh? I waited about 2-3 minutes for my order to arrive. It was super hot...microwave hot. Places that actually cook fresh don't actually have to say it, it's obvious.  Not a single word from the person handing me the bag which is always a nice touch.  The chicken was well on its way to being jerky. I'm not saying that to be mean, or to exaggerate, I think it's accurate. The outside of each chicken chunk was hard, dry and stringy. The inside of each chunk wasn't stringy but very dry and tasteless. Obviously the meat had been cooked hours before, maybe the day before, could even have been days ago.  More of a British-Chinese fusion thing.  Teriyaki Chicken? Not even close. It's old chicken with some kind of brown sweet thin liquid poured over it and microwaved.  I rarely throw out food, a chicken gave its life for this and I shouldn't waste it...but most of this went into the can. Wish I had a dog.  The egg roll was the standard manufactured type which is fine.  The Crab Puffs were interesting. Of course there's no crab in it...or seafood of any kind. It looked and tasted like a cube of cream cheese in a fried wonton. Not exactly what I think of when I think Chinese. Maybe not exactly good, but not bad either. I wouldn't personally eat another one but these were edible.  Phoenix has some truly bad Chinese restaurants and Siu Wok is at the bottom of my list so far.",

There was pretty much no color to the entire order - it was all brown. The egg rolls were soggy and pretty bland. It's a lot of food for the money that you pay, but it's just not worth it because of the grease, brown color, and it all tasted the same as in - the greasy low mean tasted like the fried rice which tasted the same as the entree.  also tried the egg flower soup and it didn't keep a brothy consistency at all. It started to get thick and grease started to float to the top.   The $25 for takeout was a waste of my money. Pretty much took a few bites and could Not finish it. Should have just had a bowl of cereal for dinner or paid the extra money for Pei Wei. Lesson learned.",

Delivery time made it not quite as crispy as in the restaurant, however.  3. Chicken Lo Mein - the chicken was dry and tough, but the noodles and sauce were delicious.  4, \"Crab\" Puffs.  I put the word crab in quotes as this is what they call it.  However, there wasn't a SHRED of crabmeat in ANY of the puffs.  I was cream cheese stuffed into a wonton and fried.  If I hadn't ordered this last dish, this restaurant probably would have received a higher rating.",

    "text": "***Siu Wok's customer service policy is that no once cares, because management doesn't want to speak with their customers much less address concerns.  We spend an average of $45 a week on what was our favorite Chinese restaurant delivery in town... lately, we have had issues with the customer service. One such man, Alonzo, didn't feel that it was important to A) know what the menu items were to begin with, and B) what sauces came with the menu items, as we attempted to order extra sauce, which we were charged for but never received. Upon a return call to advise that we not only never received said sauce, but received chili sauce, which made NO sense...he proceeded to argue, to speak over me and condescend in a manner that was inappropriate in every imaginable customer service scenario. I asked to speak with the manager only to be told he was 'out on a delivery', and I asked for a return call when he was finished. He asked for my number, to which I replied, \"You have my number, you repeat it to me every time I call\"... he then proceeded to insist he didn't, so I gave him the #, which he repeated back to me incorrectly. Never got a call back, the next day I called again, and was told that the manager not only wasn't there, but that it was company policy that the manager will not speak with customers. Bullshit. It sounds petty, but I will not do business with a restaurant who has a policy that disregards customer service as unimportant.",

    "text": "This place is good.  Let me tell you, outside of NY, it's hard to find decent Chinese food.  I've only eaten at 2 other Chinese spots here in Phoenix (West Valley) (aside from PF Changs - which I don't consider Chinese (Asian Fusion?) but as far as local Chinese spots, this one is good.  I can't really judge too much as my take out from this place has been pretty limited, but the chicken and broccoli is good (I've had it 2x now).  I've also tried the Lo Mein and that was pretty good too!  The egg rolls are par (I've had better / I've had worse) and the Hot and Sour soup is pretty good.  I've never had Hot and Sour soup with big pieces of shrimp in it, but to my surprise, it was good.  And I'll tell you, if those are the size of the shrimp in any combination that has shrimp in it, it's a good deal!  I was disappointed however that the order didn't come with noodles!  Ummm, hello?  This is a Chinese restaurant, right?  I ordered a quart of Hot and Sour soup and I don't get noodles with it?  And I know it's an Arizona thing, but they've never heard of Duck Sauce?  Get with the program Arizona!  Duck sauce is where it's at!  I need it with my fried rice!  I had the lunch combination the second time I ordered from this place and it comes with 2 cream cheese wontons.  Surprisingly, they were delicious!  The fried rice, eh, I could take it or leave it.  It didn't blow me away.  I might have to try their dinner menu as it seems the combo's come with an Eggroll and Lo Mein as well as the main dish and rice.  Looks like a pretty good deal!  Again, my take on this place is pretty good.  I've only ordered 2x (Lunch) but both times I ordered, they didn't disappoint.  I can't rank it 5 stars as I've only tried like 2 of their dishes, but it was a decent sized portion, the prices are on par with other Chinese food options, and the food is good.  To my understanding, they also have a great delivery area; they deliver far and wide.  So, would I recommend it based on my experiences?  Absolutely!  I would definitely go back for take out here again.  However, this review could change when I change my order up a little.  I'm a little hesitant to try something new as I'm afraid I'll be disappointed, but from what I've tasted already, it's gonna have to be worth a shot...",

    "text": "Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.  My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.  I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.  Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??",

The food was okay but not quite worth the couple extra dollars they charge compared to other Chinese Restaurants.   Now I will say that overall I enjoyed my time at Siu Wok so definitely stop in and try it.   We had the General Tso's combo. The Lo Mein was a bit too greasy, and the fried rice & egg roll were also a bit too oily. Maybe something to work on.  The General Tso's was crispy which was nice but not quite spicy enough for my taste. I will ask them to kick it up next time.   My favorite part (aside from the lovely Jasmine Tea) was the crab puffs. Better than many other restaurants. The wait staff were very nice and attentive. Which is great!  This place has the opportunity to be great and I hope they can follow through. Then I can change my review some other time.",

I always order a small egg drop soup and either a combination plate or a dinner plate of the lemon chicken. Not all of their chicken is white meat, so if that matters to you ask before ordering. The price is SO good for what you get. Their \"eggrolls\" are actually spring rolls and I'm not a huge fan of them. We've ordered take out and it's almost as good as when you sit down. The chicken doesn't get mushy or dry. My boyfriend always orders the sweet and sour and it's one if his favorite dishes, ever. The staff has always been super sweet to us. The same woman always waits on us and is still trying to learn English so please be patient and kind. She's so sweet. We love her. She's a sweetheart. I will say that their orange chicken is VERY salty. I always compare orange chicken to Panda Express and it's a completely different taste here. Their sesame chicken is pretty salty as well but not as bad! I definitely recommend you give them a try!",

You can order anything from the menu, and they will replace the meat with either crispy or boiled tofu. The portions are also huge! I could not finish my dish. It was totally worth the money,  it is a clean restaurant,  and very inexpensive too.  Not the most authentic Chinese food out there, but for the price and the amount of food that you get it is excellent.  It is also close to the light rail, so that is a big plus.",

    "text": "I've been to the old location 15-20 times. It was always a cheap and reliable but not amazing neighborhood Chinese restaurant. I thought they went out of business but someone told me they moved. So I dropped by the new location today for lunch.  It's much bigger inside than the old restaurant. There is no counter to order from, it's now full table service. I ordered a coke and a sweet and sour pork lunch combo. The prices have increased a little and there is no longer free refills. So I paid $2 for a cup full of ice and 6-7 ounces of coke. That's gouging. I know what coke syrup costs.   Most unfortunately, the food was quite bad.   The modest portion of fried rice was barely warm. The bits of egg were dark yellow and hard. I bet it was cooked a few hours ago and became dried out. The pork was full of gristle. About half of the pieces were just plain inedible unless it was supposed to taste like pig's feet. It was like chewing on cartilage and fat. The egg roll was crispy on the outside, but the inside vegetables were mushy. The frozen aisle of Costco has better egg rolls.   I was so disappointed with my meal. I ordered off a menu, but it tasted worse than a low tier buffet. It's a shame, because I used to like Siu Wok, but they are skimping on the quality of the food. The old location's food tasted considerably better. If they keep serving food like this, they will go out of business. I won't go back. The quality to price ratio is off.",

The white meat chicken was very tasty and the sauce was very flavorful and not greasy.  I was even more impressed that the broccoli was still crunchy and not a mushy mess!  The portions were large (I ordered the combo plates).  The crab puffs were good but those are best eaten right out of the fryer.  The rice was tasty and a,so not greasy.

Lately, however, I've become VERY disillusioned with your products and your service.  Case in point: soup orders and egg rolls. Carry-out soup orders, large or small, are now being consistently \"shorted,\" i.e., less product is in the containers; the containers are now noticeably underfilled, compared to previous purchases. And since you have transitioned from eggrolls with chicken to strictly vegetable eggrolls, the size of each eggroll is substantially smaller than before, though the price remains the same at $1.50 each. Half-size really should translate into half-price, i.e., 75 cents per eggroll.  As for your service, chaos seems to have descended on your ordering counter. Yesterday (March 20), orders were taking so long to fill that three customers were inquiring as to refunds. One of those three customers was told that the order was \"on delivery,\" though the customer said she had not requested delivery. One customer had to suffer through a lost lunch hour because her order was not \"punched into\" the front-counter computer.  I'd REALLY like to remain your customer...and will patronize you in the short term to see if any of the above-mentioned issues are addressed. If they're not, well...I'll simply exercise my option to purchase lunch elsewhere. Likely, other current customers will walk away too.",

    "text": "I had lived within walking distance of this establishment for nearly a year before I had tried it. It's location in a strip mall and outward appearance were part of it, as well as the spotty Yelp reviews. Finally, after being discouraged with several of the other nearby Chinese food establishments, I decided to give it a go. I decided that I would pick it up, just so I could see how the place was inside before jumping in. Inside its very clean, and most of the furnishings look pretty well kept. Surprised by a bar area, but didn't investigate because the task at hand was getting food and returning home to my puppy. Ordered beef fried rice and General Tso's chicken large plate, which came out pretty quickly. I returned home and dove in, and I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed at all. Portion size is massive, food is good solid middle of the road Chinese food. Definitely an upgrade from Panda and in my opinion, far better than the other local Chinese fares. I have since ordered delivery and over the phone and still continue to be satisfied with everything I have ordered. My fiancee gets some type of curry chicken that she enjoys and I haven't varied from my beloved General Tso's chicken. Glad that I gave this place a shot, and hope this review encourages others to do so as well if they are on the fence.",

Portion sizes are huge too. The restaurant itself is very large and nice and clean, but was empty when I went Thursday evening an hour before close to get a take out order. I know this spot was a different Asian fusion hipster place that was only open a couple months prior to Siu Wok. So hopefully they can keep their doors open from take out and delivery.",

I did enjoy the rice, but felt there could have been more. I had a Tsingtao beer from China, that had a mild taste and was refreshing on a hot afternoon. The service was excellent. Overall I give 3 stars. In this area of town there are so many good choices for Panasian cuisine, that you really have to be on your game to stand out. This visit today just didn't make it.",

Also ordered the \"Sun Devil Chicken\" (no spicy-which I've done before and it had veggies then) this time it came in a plastic container just chicken and sauce...no veg .

I am glad I ordered the beef soup, otherwise nothing would have been edible. I was told upon ordering that it would take about 40 minutes for delivery, they were at my place in 15, so kudos there. The delivery person was extremely rude (not sure why) and heckled me about the tip amount - I tip based on service and this fellow was very rude. We tried to use the coupon we received before, but I was told that we would need to wait until after 5pm for the coupon (?) The food was worse than all you can eat buffet food, and I would dare say some of the worst tasting I have ever had at any Chinese food eatery in the Valley. The portions were substantive, but the food appeared to have been reheated or stale. The soup was the only saving grace for my order, but we couldn't split it in seven, so we ended up going to China Village instead. We tried to feed some of the food to the neighbor's two dogs, but they wouldn't touch it. I learned an expensive lesson.",

It is rare to see chicken in a side dish like that but the lo mein and fried rice were probably my favorite part of the dish. I really enjoyed the egg roll. The crab puffs were really more cream cheese won tons both still tasty. The dinner entrees start at $7.45 but you get a good amount of food. The service was good and the new location is really nice. If you only ever ordered out from here before I suggest you come by and check out the changes. I would come back to this location for take-out or dine-in.",

    "text": "I'm catching up on reviews -- finally! It has been far too long.  I used to go to this building for SoChu House, one of the famous (or, perhaps to some locals, infamous) Johnny Chu's restaurants. I was a fan ever since I first visited Fate many years ago, back when downtown Phoenix was a very different place, and before it eventually became Bliss/ReBar (and before Fate even added the bar side of things next door.) As with many things downtown, they sometimes change rapidly. When it became Siu Wok, I never really paid much attention -- a very different type of restaurant, after all.  However, upon moving into our new place downtown late last year, we suddenly had a craving for Chinese food, but we were far too lazy after moving in to go out anywhere (or to cook!) We checked out places online and noticed that Siu Wok delivers. We rarely order anything for delivery, but we figured we'd check it out.   We found out that they offer extremely reasonable prices for dinner plates/combos that feature 2 cream cheese puffs, an egg roll, a sizeable entree, fried rice, AND lo mein. We have since ordered many other times, and the total for 2 of these large meals plus delivery and tax comes out to about $25. Bonus: it's pretty delicious, too! While I wouldn't say it's anything spectacular, we've tried about half of their menu of entrees by now with no issues whatsoever. The only times I didn't like anything were when I just didn't like certain ingredients due to personal taste, but I love trying new things :)  They are always friendly, and they often deliver much faster than expected. They usually quote us at 45-60 minutes for delivery, but I don't think we've ever really waited more than 30 minutes. This is always a welcome thing when one is starving and lazy. :)  I'm giving them 5 stars not because the food will necessarily blow you away, but because we've ordered from them many times and it has consistently been good every time. The reasonable prices and fast delivery are certainly bonuses, on top of the food being quite delicious. Highly recommended for a solid and affordable experience!",

We decided to try it for take out one night and see if the strange little place next to FEZ was good or not.  Well, my verdict is it's pretty great!  Not China Chili Orange Chicken spicy ok great, but it was really yummy.  When we ordered, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I ordered, and consequently ate, way too much.  I got a small order of egg flower soup, which is actually pretty big, and the Honey Walnut Shrimp Dinner Combo.  Just saying that is a mouthful.  Anyway, the fried rice that came with the combo was just meh.  The Chicken Lo Mein was really tasty and could be a stand alone dish.  The Egg Rolls were really yummy and if I hadn't eaten too much already I would have ate the other one I traded for Crab Puffs.  I hate crab puffs so I didn't eat them.  The shrimp were yummy!  They don't have any breading or anything so that was a big plus and the totally bad for you sweet and tangy mayo sauce was awesome.  The walnuts were good too.  The best part of my meal though was the Egg Flower Soup.  It was FANTASTIC!  I've been dying to find a really good egg drop/flower soup for a long time now, because it's my favorite thing to eat when I'm sick.  I have finally found it.  I will most definitely be getting take out from Siu Wok again, and probably many many many more orders of soup.",

My bf Rickie is a spicy man so he loves spicy food, his craving, the Sun Devil chickien with gobs of jalepenos. We enjoy the crab puffs as well. Pretty standard Chinese fare, but the place lately has been spotless and the service great. It's tiny and probably does more take out and delivery. I say they're worth a shot if you're in the hood.

The idea of Panda Express makes me gag.  Most other cheapish Chinese restaurants nearby don't use quality meats and make no effort at all with their food.  Siu Wok is my absolutely favorite 'fast food style' Chinese place now.  It's super convenient for me at the office (just up the road) and I always have leftovers for the next day too.  Hands down, what sold me on this place, was their amazing won tons.  Silly thing, right?  These are a meal in themselves stuffed with all white meat chicken and never dripping in grease despite being deep fried.  I've had a few of their beef dishes which were all very good, but I really LOVE their cashew chicken.  It's all white meat chicken as well and of good quality - no tough or unexplainable bits.  The veggies are never overcooked and their sauces aren't overpowering - just add nice flavor and consistency over the rice.  I could literally eat here multiple times a week and have been regularly turning colleagues on to the place.  If only they were closer to my house out on the west side...I would love them even more.  Don't expect glamour from this place though.  This is a minimal and somewhat stereotypical joint.  I'm not going in for the decor though, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest!",

I was told the portions were a good size so why would I even think about ordering more food especially when this is my very first time ordering from this place. I live less than 3 miles from this place you think they would make an exception for customers that are really close. The problem is that their delivery radius is too large .. They go from 40th av to 47th street and from baseline to northern. They are making their delivery money back on the customers that live closest to their restaurant. I'm sorry but I will never attempt to order from there again too bad I was excited to try a new Chinese place I don't sway from one to the next I mean c'mon Chinese food is chinese food when your talking about take out or delivery.  Ill just have to go somewhere ill be appreciated for trying a restaurant for a first time, I'm sure the next Chinese restaurant will want me to be a repeat customer. Siu Wok peace of advice here, don't ever turn away customers especially new customers its just not good business or profitable, tightn up your delivery radius and then you won't have to have a $15 minimum order set, $10 minimum would do just fine.",

Exceeded my expectations for an Arizona Downtown Chinese delivery joint.  I'll be ordering from them again very soon.",

I ordered the House Special Lo Mein which came with beef, chicken, shrimp, and vegetables with noodles for $10. For their location, that's not a bad price. I'd imagine their rent is high so I can't believe their pricing is the same as other Chinese restaurants.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but boy is it gorgeous on the inside!

These items ended up feeding us for 7 meals (3.5 each), and we are pretty big eaters. The portions are more than generous, and satisfying. However, the hot&sour soup that my s/o ordered had shrimp in it, and he doesn't eat seafood, so I ended up drinking it the next day. Also, although the combo has some nice variety, the fried rice wasn't very good and I don't like the crab rangoons, so I think next time I'll just stick with the big container of steamed white rice. Yum.  Delivery did take about an hour (and we didn't get an estimate (that we could tell) for when the food would be delivered) but they do take credit cards, and you can tip on the credit card too! This is probably going to be our go-to shitty Chinese delivery place from here on out :)",

As we were staying in a hotel, and had limited resources. I got the sesame chicken, like that they put my sauce on the side. My bf got a Dragon something. Kinda too soupy for his taste. Overall we liked it.",

Here we go....  #10 - I can actually understand the people that answer the phone #9 - The sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken #8 - The lack of lasting gastral repercussions from eating said Kung Pao Chicken #7 - The friggin huge area to which they will deliver, for a minimal $2 charge (beware their website says it's a buck-fifty, but the gas crunch is effecting everyone) #6 - The pork fried rice that is literally one part rice mixed with one part tender / tasty pork #5 - The place is actually clean #4 - The coupons attached to the menus that they send to my home at regular intervals #3 -  I can call in an order, hop in my car to pick it up, and be back watching quality reality programming within 15 minutes #2 - They have Mr. Pibb on tap  And the number 1 thing that makes Siu-Wok A-OK in my book... Eight... yes count 'em, eight, yummy soups that they will deliver to my door when I just can't bring myself to change out of my pajamas!!!",

They offer the standard items you'd find at any Chinese restaurant and that's about it. They do it and do it well. Plus they deliver ($15 minimum order), which is of the utmost important when shackled to a workstation 8 hours a day or more. If you can get an order pulled together by 3pm, the offering of lunch combo specials can't be beat. 25 entrees with a side of rice, an eggroll and 2 crab puffs, most combos costing $5.95.  One of my favorite dishes is the Pork Chop Suey (not Suey made with Pork Chops, but Chop Suey made with Pork). The veggies are fresh and plentiful and make for great leftovers later in my shift or the next day.  I came very close to actually going into Siu Wok once, but it was Sunday and they were closed. Now I know...",

I ordered the orange chicken and it was a bunch of small chicken balls covered in orange goo.  The fried rice was missing the other stuff that usually comes in fried rice.  It took them 15 minutes to make it which was fine since we called ahead and it takes about that long to get there.    I'll just say it - China Chili is better in ever way.  I might come back here but everything about China Chili is better.",

BUT i did my gilfriend a huge favor and she in turn bought me dinner, and wanted to give this place a shot, mostly because we were tired and didn't want to go anywhere and they deliver (!!!!!!!!).   well, my extremely picky chinese-food hating girlfriend actually dug the meal. she ordered the lemon chicken (sauce on the side, extra lemon wedges) and white rice, and i got the szchewaun chicken combo with lo mein, fried rice, crab puff, and egg roll. my other friend who was with us went with the kung pao chicken combo. all three were equally amazing. well, I didn't too much care for the dry \"lemon\" chicken that my gf ordered, but she is hella picky and they made it just how she likes it so she was happy with hers. I was very satisfied with my spicy szchewaun chicken that came with zucchini, peppers, and water chestnuts, and was even more impressed by the delicious lo mein on the side. rice is rice, it was good.  great price and great food. definitely my go to chinese place now. and i'm even more excited that i'll be able to eat it more often now that they've satisfied a previous chinese food hater. yay siu wok!",

The dishes are all Americanized Chinese style as you might find in many family style restaurants in NY and Cali. I suspect most people in China wouldn't recognize any of these dishes. But no worries - it's actually good in a Chinese delivery kind of way.   I've had fried rice, a couple shrimp dishes, and also beef and pork. All were very tasty. The shrimp were large, plentiful, and tasted very good. The large egg drop soup earned it's moniker. It's actually large.  It's the only game in town in CenPho for Chinese delivery. I'm sure they are doing a brisk business!  I've never been inside. I have no idea what it's like. I'm almost scared to find out!  Their delivery area is      northern 43rd      40th ave       st.    Buckeye  and the delivery fee is only $1.50! I suspect that will change.",

    "text": "So I don't know where all these people are normally getting their Chinese food but this place is GOD AWFUL and I really think the owners have paid these people who have reviewed this place with me. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me.  I got the panflet sent to me in the mail and it actually delivers to my apartment which is rare so I figured why not? FAIL!!!! I should have taken my normal 10 minute drive up to Indian School.   First off the women answering the phone was rude but I digress. Second off this place is not cheap and I wound up paying almost 30 bucks for little portions of god awful food.  The Hot and sour soup is awful. I couldn't eat it. Who puts pork into that soup? It wasn't even spicy!!! It also smelled terrible. It looked like a mish mosh of whatever they had lying around the kitchen and then they soaked it in the leftover eggdrop soup.  It didn't contain the usual mix of chinese mushrooms that you would normally find along with that dark brown chili broth that I live for.  The fried rice was dry as a bone and the expensive 10.95 pu-pu platter was a few pieces of dry overcooked pork, 1 ghetto chicken wing that we were afraid to eat and these measly little dried shrimps.   The egg rolls were dry, tasteless and inedible.  I ordered the orange chicken and I seriously think that they pre-ordered this stuff from some ready- made food company and microwaved it because it started to make me nauseous.   And now the dumplings.....It says we were suppose to get 8 and the pictures looked good..what we got was 6 shriveled little things and I don't even want to venture with whats inside.   I am from New York and have had my share of bad and good Chinese and I know I will not get the quality of good NYC Chinese food in Phoenix but this is just bad, overpriced food, with a nasty receptionist and I will NEVER eat here again!!  Pass the Maalox please!!!",

Can't go wrong in this place, at least not that I've experienced. It is very small and dated, but the food will impress. The prices are also cheap for the amount of food and quality of everything on the plate. Lemon chicken is my favorite thing, the sauce is a light sweet coating on the well fried chicken.",

While I wouldn't go so far as to say this is one of the best Chinese places in the area, I do appreciate them being around. The people who work here are super friendly and they've got a killer lunch special.

The skinny I found this place about 8-9 years ago and have been a fan this place since, it has the best orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp I have ever had. Now I have never actually sat and ate here but I always take my order to go or delivery which is insane how far they go. The orange chicken has plenty of sauce but the chicken is always crispy if you get the combo plate they will add 2 crab puffs egg roll and rice and noodles which are also to die for if you go after 5pm and spend 15$+ they will throw in free crab puffs with coupon and coupon is in menu so just pick one up. The girls are always sweet in front area and are always so quick.  The bad  Once the delivery driver was pretty aggressive with the tip he made sure to let me know twice where the tip line was on my check even after I told him I had cash for tip. Another time they got my order wrong and did not give me combo plate but manager made it up by offering free crab puffs next time which I didn't take advantage of as I always use that coupon but even then I wasn't too bummed out this place rocks. They also have gone on month long vacations and have closed for that long which drove us insane lol. Overall this place is one of my favorite spots and they maybe yours too if you give them a shot.",

Interestingly enough, the water had very little ice...almost melted before it reached the table.  The new dining room is large, more updated than the old location. And looks like they will have a full bar soon. Hopefully in time, the service will improve and soda refills will not be extra  charge. If so, order no ice! This is a good place for regular comfort Chinese food.   It always hits the spot.",

It came out fairly fast which leads me to believe it is made in advance and simply reheated (definitely tastes that way also). The \"fried\" rice just looked so unappetizing, dried up white rice mixed in soy basically, large portion of chicken, in which the sauce was the only flavorful item I ingested while there. Moving on to the crab puffs and egg roll, eh they were alright sad to say they were cold though. I most definitely tried everything on my plate as I am a firm believer in \"don't knock it 'till you try it\", but that was $20 down the trash and down the toilet after an unpleasant hurl session. I do not recommend this place nor will I even consider taking my worst enemy here. FYI I also made a Yelp account just for this review.",

I've only ever ordered delivery from them, and they give you a BUNCH of food and I can't really complain about any of that filler crap that you get a lot at chinese places. I may not eat all my vegetables but that's really on me -- they're delicious. This isn't the absolute best chinese I've ever had, but their prices, while not by any means a big-time bargain, are extremely commensurate with the quantity and quality of the food, and paying 25 bucks up and down including tip for two solid meals delivered in 15 minutes is really decent.  I've had their house lo mein which is very good and the shrimp with lobster sauce, which is a LITTLE heavy on the veggies, but it's very good as well. I'm a big fat guy and I get two meals out of that order. The girl that answers the phone is nice, and the question you're having a hard time understanding her say while you're giving her your credit card no. is \"expiration date?\" They save your number too which is handy.  This could honestly be five stars for food/service/price combo, but it's not, like a FIVE-STAR meal, you know? There exists better chinese in the world. But if you take it all into account, I couldn't really ask for more. This is a great place.",

My order arrives in about 20 or so minutes. I'm used to Siu Wok having large portions and real ingredients, but this time they've outdone themselves. Won Ton Soup: 6 LARGE shrimp, thickly sliced pork, firm Won Ton and nicely done veggies (this would be almost two meals for me). The Twice-Cooked Pork wasn't their usual...normally the pork is sliced thin, this was thick slices of roast pork (the norm is thinly sliced and dark), good, but not twice cooked. This was a \"combo\" with a large serving of Lo Mein, some \"meh\" fried rice, a crunchy Egg Roll and the ubiquitous  Crab Puff. Pot Stickers/Fried Dumplings were very nicely done, with a spicy soy/vinegar dipping sauce.  Their prices have increased by a dollar since 2013, with the large entrees averaging 8.50 and the \"combo\" meal a dollar more. Portions are LARGE, so IMHO Siu Wok is still a great value. It's Asian-style comfort food and still my go-to for take-out Chinese.",

I really like how this place has Dinner Combinations where as many other Chinese Restaurants often have only Lunch Specials, all dinner options are made for sharing.  We decided to share but still utilize the combination. Each combination came with an egg roll (standard), fried rice (standard), Crab Wontons (cheesy good), and Chicken Lo Mein (excellent). The entrees we chose were Teriyaki Chicken (good), Mongolian Beef (standard), and Tangerine Chicken (Awesome!).   I will be ordering from here again. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone.   **make sure to order WHITE MEAT for the extra dollar.**",

I would rather go to Panda for the price.  I'm not a food snob, so all I can say is give it a try, but don't go in with high hopes.  Also, the parking lot is shared with Subway, Lenny's, IchiBan and Panera, so needless to say, there isn't much parking.",
