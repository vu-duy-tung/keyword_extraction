The bruschetta was freshly chopped tomatoes, garlic, and peppers on golden toasts. Love the presentation too. The fried appie plate was flavorful bits of calamari, mozzarella, and cheesy mushrooms. We shared the frutti del mar spiced delicately and filled with shrimp, mussels, and squid. The chicken pram was heavenly as was the baked ziti. No dessert tonight for us... Too full!!  I will be back Buca and it won't be a three year wait.",

    "text": "I'm truly astonished at the amount of negative reviews for Buca!  I've had nothing but excellent service and great food at this place.  This place, hands down, has the best caesar salad I've ever had in my life (100% serious).    Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of taking a chunk out of my life savings to pay for a dinner bill for 3 people, but I've always left painfully full with a large bag of leftovers.  It doesn't have the warm, hole-in-the-wall Italian ristorante thing going on, but the atmosphere is still very welcoming and I love that for large parties, you have your own private section.   Each room has it's own theme and you can stare at the walls all night and still find something you missed before.  Anyone who is unhappy with the wall decor was evidently not seated in the room with the pope head because if that's not class to you, I don't want to know you.   Perhaps those decorating needs would be better met at a faux-posh restaurant with paintings and wall decor that looks strikingly similar to the Big Lots Home Accents section like they have at The Olive Garden (which is still super delicious by the way).   Seriously with the food though, definitely on my top 10 list of death row meals.  I could totally go down with their Veal Parmesan making itself a coffin out of my stomach.",

After a few minutes discussing it we came to the conclusion that a bathroom drain somewhere is flowing the wrong way. All this aside we decided to stay and tough it out. Some of the silverware was dirty. The bread was good! The chicken saltimbucco was over cooked and therefore dry. The saving grace was the tiramisu. It was amazing! Our service was shaky at first but got better. So check the smell and if u can take it, grab some bread and tiramisu and run!   Solid 3 stars!",

We also noticed all the flowers outside were fake and pretty worn out, which made the place look ridiculous, cheap, and unkempt. So for environment, we would rate it a 2 star.We placed our order online, which was convenient, but when we showed up to pick up our food the place was dead and we couldn't find anyone to help us. Two employees actually made eye contact with us and then went right back to talking and slacking off. After about 10 minutes, someone did finally wander up front to get us our order.   We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Penne San Remo, stuffed shells, and chocolate chip cannolis. The meal came with french bread but the bread was stale and cold. The mushrooms weren't too bad. The sauce was tasty but the stuffing overpowered the mushrooms so it ended up tasting like sharp cheese and sauce. The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price. Actually, none of the food we got was worth the price. We paid over 60 dollars for a dinner that was maybe worth 30. All in all we weren't impressed and won't be returning.",

The waitress apologized for how long everything took and still took a total of 15 minutes to check us out and give us our boxes.  My g Food was good, I got the spicy rigatoni.  My friends who got the spaghetti complained of the noodles having no flavor and the sauce tasted like just plain tomatoes with no seasoning at all. I called bucca to complain and they didn't answer and I'm still waiting to hear from corporate since Thursday.  very disappointed especially since this was a work birthday lunch.",

I arrived 15 beforehand with a handwritten list of food and wine to place the order before all the family arrived. When I handed over our Baskin Robbins ice cream cake I looked the server directly in the eye and told her to BE CERTAIN to place it in the freezer- not the fridge- as it is an ice cream cake. She laughed and said \"Absolutely, Of course!\"  I was disappointed to find that our party of 12 was seated in two separate tables right next to another family that had 3 toddlers. It was a Sunday night at 5pm and the restaurant was very empty. The toddlers next to us were absolutely screaming the entire time and we were not able to hear our family conversation. Surely they could've placed us with more space between us to make our evening more pleasant instead of what was easier for the server.  It took our waitress far too long to bring out my son's cake when we asked again. To my horror, the waitress delivered our half-melted ice cream cake and ran off as I said, \"Oh no! What happened?\"  No one stayed. They ran!! We tried to serve some of the middle that was a bit slushy, but it was ridiculous.    The waitress emerged with our bill and said she took off our salad because they ruined our cake. The salad was $21. Our cake was $40!! No manager, no apology.  No chance anyone in my extended family will return. It was our first visit and definitely our last.",

We waited till about 4:20.  We were seated next to the rear door, so there was a cold breeze every time he door was opened(they were using the outdoor patio to increase seating capacity). We finally ordered our meal.  After a fairly long wait, our food was delivered.  What a disappointment.  Turkey was dry as a bone.  One tiny dish of cranberry dressing, and a small serving of potatoes.  There was stuffing under the turkey that was terrible.  Who thought that anise would be a good seasoning for turkey stuffing? The only thing that I would call \"good\" was the potatoes. I have spent Thanksgiving on a destroyer off the coast of Beirut, and that dinner was far and away better than this mess was. The cost for this \"culinary adventure\"?  $295 for 9 people.  Never again !  Buca is passable for their Italian food, and I mean just passable.  I grew up in an Italian house, in an Italian neighborhood, speaking Italian.  I've owned and run Italian restaurants. I'm still the partial owner of one of the largest private Italian restaurants and clubs in the world  (over 35,000 members). It's hard to impress me when it comes to Italian fare.  There are very few that I would call good Italian food, Buca is not one of them. BUT, stay away from these people for Thanksgiving dinner.  I made the mistake, don't do the same.",

So I had my fill of bread which is served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I don't know if it was just our server but the ratio was way off, more vinegar would have been ideal.   I think saying the entrees will feed 2 or more is extremely misleading, we ordered 2 entrees based on the suggestion it would be more than enough. It wasn't.   We had one order of Cheese Ravioli and one order of Chicken Marsala.  The sauce on the Ravioli was bland, not a lot of flavor.  The Chicken Marsala had a great flavor but just three small pieces of chicken and nothing else. I really expected it to come with a little pasta or potatoes. Very disappointing.   I left with 3 people who weren't full and with a lot less cash in our pockets.",

Italian is one of my favorite foods and I've never had anything, other than the garlic bread, that really stands out here.  Yeah the inside is neat and the staff is always good... but the pasta sauce is nothing special.  Everything seems like bland Italian food, in comparison of the many other options in the category especially.  It also isn't cheap.  For chain Italian restaurants, I'd take Olive Garden, Carabba's, Brio.    Also, I somehow end up with in this place with work people or friends that don't like some damn thing.  I'll eat everything, but considering the menu is just OK as it is, I end up getting stuck with the most mediocre dish at a medicre restaurant.  This makes me want to stab someone.  Family style is great if you are with your family, if you are with a bunch of vegetarians... REDRUM! REDRUM!  Yeah yeah, I can get individual orders now.  So I can be THAT guy, that goes to a family style restaurant and is like, NO, I'm ordering my own thing, you all suck.  While YES, that is totally True, I don't want everyone to necessarily know it.  Pizza places is where you are supposed to go with a group of people and argue about what to order, not pasta places.",

Saturday 9-17 was my Birthday and we had the best server ever, his name was Shane he was so polite and kept coming to our table to see if we needed anything else. My friend told him it was my Birthday and he did offer if I wanted them to sing to me and I said no Thank You, anyways we were getting ready to leave and I was putting the one piece of bread in the container he gave us and he offer me more bread and I thought that was so sweet of him to do that, then he came back and gave me a little Birthday Cake for my Birthday that just touched my heart for him to go out of his way. And thanks to Shane that was the only Birthday cake I had.  I will never forget this day because of Shane. We need more people like him.  And of course the food was Superb. I will definitely come back",

    "text": "I usually love Buca di Beppo which is why I decided to celebrate my birthday there. My boyfriend made a reservation for the 15 people in our party and clearly let them know it was a birthday celebration, as per usual with birthdays there is a birthday cake, duh. My sister in law bakes the most amazing homemade cakes so she brought one over to dinner and then our waiter informed us there was a $15 fee for bringing the cake inside the restaurant ( I really wish we were told about this fee when we made the reservation for a BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION). When we asked the waiter why there was a fee he said it was because then we wouldn't order none of their deserts, so we said we would order a dessert because we would rather pay for a dessert then pay $15 for nothing. Our waiter asked his manager and he said we had to purchase 2 deserts to void this $15 fee. We begrudgingly agreed to buy 2 desserts. I hate to bash on the waiter because I know being a server is tough but ours clearly did not want to be at work that day. We had people arrive at different times since there was a large group of us meeting there and he forgot to get drink orders for some of us. He did not take our orders in order and just didn't have a good attitude, frankly I think It was too big of a table for one waiter but that's more of a management issue.  We had separate checks as I'm sure is common for large parties and we all had coupons that were emailed to us from Buca for $20 off. Our waiter said the coupons were only one per table but when we read the fine print it said one per check. So he had to go get his manager to get that approved, he ended up getting it approved and we ended up cutting the cake ourselves and singing happy birthday on our own because no one approached our table to do the birthday stuff. The service really disappointed me especially since they advertise on the building that they do birthday parties yet cannot wait on a large group properly and charge people a fee for bringing in a birthday cake. I'm sad to say this would be the last birthday I celebrate at Buca de Beppo.",

I ordered a $15.99 Caesar Salad, first off if someone pays that much money for a salad the bowl should be full it was 2/3 full, not a big bowl. Another thing the lettuce was horrible wilted and black around the edges, gross. The employee who prepared the salad through in the end, gee thanks.   We ordered the Fettuccine supremo it tasted flat. Not much flavor in the sauce. They used shaved chicken and not much of it. Not even a whole breast of chicken. Six pieces of broccoli. The noodles were of poor quality. We ordered the small it was $23.99.  We also ordered the garlic bread. It was the best part of the meal. It was made on cheap not fresh white bread. Horrible for 10 bucks.   I'm done with this place! To many other good places to eat in Chandler, that use good quality ingredients for less money.",

I got my phone out to show her the coupon on my phone and she said \"we only take coupons you have to give us.\" As I was still talking to her she walked away from me-out of the room and showed up behind me with my food-again while I was still taking!

    "text": "We have eaten or gotten take-out here several times. I like the fun decor and atmoshpere, except that it can be WAY too loud. That just means another group is having fun, but they get some pretty large groups and it is quite annoying to be seated a few feet away.  Regardless of the decor, don't come for the food, because it is not very good and is apparently *very* inconsistent. We have tried their baked dishes and didn't finish them because they were bland and just didn't taste good. Usually the spaghetti with meat sauce is practically all pasta. You can ask for extra sauce but they want to charge you for it (at least this is the case for take-out). The meat sauce has a funny taste. It isn't old, but the taste reminds me of something that is old.  Nonetheless, when we went out of town we decided to get pizza (usually good here) and pasta from Buca di Beppo to leave with the kids, and this is when it got bizarre. They must have made too much sauce that morning, or maybe it was a weird prank, because this time the \"spaghetti\" was probably three-quarters meat sauce! Weird; and not appetizing, and not a normal meal. And we didn't even ask for extra meat sauce. But the strangest thing is that when we got home from our trip, we found out the kids didn't eat any of the pizza. They would heat it up and throw it out because they didn't like it. I decided to have some just to get rid of it. It was pretty limp so I baked it in the toaster oven on the highest setting. Tried a bite and despite being re-baked, it was just plain mushy. It turns out there was meat sauce in the pizza -- lots of it! My wife did not order any meat sauce on the pizza. If all pizza tasted like this, I would never eat pizza again.  This tale might have ended okay if the restaurant did the right thing. Since the pizza was a total loss, my wife took it back to the restaurant the day after we got back. It is hard to believe but they would not give a refund, \"because it's been a week.\" This is not a good way to do business.  *UPDATE 05/28/2013*  I was pretty offended on behalf of my wife when I wrote this, she having been brushed off by the person on duty at the cash register. Regardless, the fact is that my wife is back to buying take out here, now and then. So the food isn't (normally) bad, although it is still a matter of taste.",

We shared a vegetable pasta dish and started with garlic bread. The garlic bread was ok (even better the next day when heated up at home).  The chocolate gelato was a nice end to the meal - though again not the best I've had. This would be a fun place to go with a large group - especially since the meals are mostly made family style for sharing. Our waiter was great.",

My husband and I ordered the chicken Alfredo with broccoli and when our food came out I must say it was a pretty big portion for a small. It actually fed 4 of us. I was very disappointed because they had no hot sauce, but I understand some places don't offer it. The meal was bland , it didn't really have a taste to it. It was just missing something.   I must say our waiter was delightful ! He was very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of.   I gave it a 3 star because if it wasn't for our nice waiter, I'd just give it a 2.",

There are 14 of us so the large portions were wonderful and the space is able to accommodate us all comfortably. We ordered calamari first which was delicious. We then got a gorgonzola salad, pizza, spicy pasta and carbonara. All items were tasty. The prices are on the high side but this is expected given the large portions. The service was a bit slow which was disappointing because it was not very full there. There was also an odd odor which brought the ambiance down a tad. However, my family enjoyed themselves and we will likely be back next year.",

There is no fresh parmesan available on request (this is when the waiter recommend Olive garden instead of bucca). On top of all of this, they can't even mix a good drink. What a sad disappointment of Italian dining. We exited through the kitchen where the Mexican cooks commented on how gringos love bland food. I guess they listen to their demographic?",

Staff is ultra-nice and they give you a tour of the kitchen so you can inspect its cleanliness before you even eat; impressive, to me.

It tasted as though it was a can of crushed tomatoes combined with a drained can of green beans. And that's it. My husband's Caesar salad was not fresh. The chicken rigatoni came with a nice spicy tomato sauce which the chef inexplicably decided to ruin by dumping a bag of frozen peas into it.  The decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty. I think the only people who come here are large families or groups wanting to take advantage of the humongous portion sizes. There were no less than three tables with toddlers whose parents thought it was ok to let them scream their head off and/or run around the restaurant while they sat at the table with a glass of wine talking to their friends. Which reminds me, their Chianti is terrible. I see no reason to return.",

    "text": "We went in on a Sunday evening for a huge business dinner. We probably had 15-20 people. All of the staff was very helpful. The food was good and the cheesecake was to die for! But one server in particular stood out. Christina was helping us during the dinner and afterwards when a few of us stayed at the bar. She was fun, friendly and Knowledgeable!!! She was very attentive and made us feel at home. Often when receiving service in a restaurant you will feel like the server is only there to do their job (because that's all that is required) but Christina went above and beyond and made us feel like she enjoyed being there and that our company was not only welcome but appreciated! We will come back just for Christina!!  P.S. I think the staff should get to wear costumes on Halloween because they are awesome and it would be fun!!",

    "text": "this is the worst experience I've ever had at this restaurant. I am BEYOND disappointed and just plain hungry.   whenever we come to town, we like to come here because we don't have one at home. I made a reservation and got here about 5 minutes early.   the first thing we smelled was an amazing garlic smell in the parking lot. unfortunately the closer we got to the front doors of the restaurant, the more it smelled like raw sewage. then we found out that we would have to wait because our table wasn't ready. and they don't have pagers so you HAVE to wait by the front door or you can't hear the girl with the tiny voice call your name. so we had to stand in that smell for 45 MINUTES.   despite our reservation we waited almost an hour. we watched other people get tables and come out already fed in the time we waited. then when we finally got a table, they couldn't accommodate our party of 7 so we had to split up just so we could eat. what was supposed to be a nice welcome meal to celebrate a friend coming to arizona for the first time has turned into \"let's eat and get the hell outta here.\"   our appetizers were cold and our entrees were alright. when we ordered drinks there weren't any clean glasses so we had to wait again. then we got nothing but a quick \"uh sorry\" about the entire thing from our hostess.   the one shining star in all this was out server, Christina. she was awesome.  but NEVER AGAIN. the star is for Christina. if it weren't for her, I wouldn't give any stars at all. the manager needs to be retrained, the hostesses need a class on customer service and even that might not help.",

The salad was wilted with way too much dressing and the dessert tasted almost freezer burnt? The service was sooooo slow.  I took a group of people there for a celebratory dinner and I can say with 100% certainly I will not choose this place again. Oh, and the waitress spilled water on my husbands lap.  Good times.  UPDATE: Someone from Buca replied here to give them my email address supposedly in an effort to make it right.  Guess what's they never contacted me back!  About par for the course I guess.  Taking my rating down from 2 to 1.  Now I think they are fake.  They pretend they care.  They probably just asked me to give off the perception to other people reading reviews that they have the heart to make things right for the customer.  Not the case.  UPDATE Jan2015: Emily Bishop the Division Vice President emailed me saying she wanted to \"restore my faith in Buca\"  I promptly responded with an email about what happened... Guess what?.... NO RESPONSE BACK!  (It's now been over a month) Wow is all I have to say....",

My Father and I ended up ordering the Lasanga and my Daughter the traditional Fetticine. Both were excellent. Thought the portions at this place are ridiculous. A small dish will feed at least three people and the large, forget about it. The large will feed at least the whole family. We definitly brought food home!     The atmosphere in this place is wonderful too. They take you throught hte kitchen to get your table and you go through the kitchen again to leave.Definitly gives you the feeling like you just came home to have dinner. I loved it and will plan to return again soon.",

    "text": "Celebrated my birthday with my family today. We had a party of 7 and reserved a table for 4 pm. There was only 1 server for the entire dining room. The server was running all over, trying to handle all her tables so our service was rushed. We ordered a garden salad but got a Caesar salad. One of my party couldn't eat it because it has anchovies and he's allergic to fish. We didn't complain to our server because she was by herself and running ragged. One of our dishes was cold, but again, we didn't complain. Then after a $96 Bill (before coupon)we were going to pay the entire bill with 2 gift cards but we were told that the system only recognizes 90% of the gift card, not full value! Who does that???The WHOLE reason we went there was because we had gift cards. Then after running our cards, your system apparently wouldn't even take them! They were valid cards but  we ended up having to pay out of pocket for our meal. I can't blame the server because she did her best. 5pm on a Saturday night and 1 server?. Needless to say, my first visit to  Buca De Beppo was not very impressive at all. Shame on the manager. I expected better. And fix the gift card system. Wasn't a Happy birthday meal for me.",

Cons: you can only order in larger quantities so if you have two people you will either be stuck eating the same thing or will have a high bill and leftovers.   they walk you through the kitchen as a \"tour\" before you're seated.  Menu has variety but not any beef dishes besides veal so any pasta with meat is pork.  They won't let you choose not to have sausage cause I guess the food is already made.  That would explain why the taste is very average.  So it's not really a kitchen as much as it is a reheat/prep area.  I know most places don't make the food there but that's what I'd still prefer.  Or at least trick me and pretend you do.",

    "text": "I  have been to many locations in various states, it used to be a favorite  restaurant  but this is the last visit. It has changed  since being sold and in my opinion, not for the better!  The garlic bread was a half of a round loaf with slices of garlic on it cut into wedges, now it is just slices of bread with garlic  butter.  Our evening started off fine, we sat in the bar in hopes of watching  the Cardinals  game, it wasn't  on but we asked a manager  and he changed it.  Our server, Helena was attentive, but a bit too familiar, calling everyone Loves, Honey etc I feel this is unprofessional  and it is uncomfortable. She wss  bringing our carafe of red sangria which was full of ice, too sour from the citrus and knowing  how much I can drink and feel it-1 glass of wine, i assume it was not much alcohol! We had 2 cups of minestrone and the packages of saltiness stunk horribly! We gave them to the server, she never brought more!  The two managers, bartenders and some servers decided to loudly argue about shifts and performance  in the bar, in front of everyone  at this time! Very unprofessional!   We were still eating  our soup, which was hot but average, when the pepperoni pizza and baked rigatoni arrived. The pizza was very greasy. The rigatoni could have had more cheese and sausage for the price!!  At this point we were eating,  a couple tables got up and left, including the one next to us who ordered a salad and green beans only,  then complained that their salad was too small to be a large and they would only pay for a small, so the manager fawned all over them! Helena  was AWOL!  The bartender was sloping buckets of water from the mop bucket onto the floor with the  sanibucket, a bit nasty!  We stopped eating  and still no Helena,  a minimum of 15 minutes, I think more, we were done, needing our food wrapped and our check! She seemed to be very grumpy, maybe the manager  yelled  at her about the salad!  She took the pizza to wtap, didn't  come back, didn't  come back... we were going to get dessert  but decided not to! She finally  came back, packaged  the rigatoni and brought the check.  Neither manager EVER said Hello, mentioned the horrible,  stinky crackers, etc! As we left, the bartender seemed frustrated.. I think the earlier conversation  and whatever went on in the kitchen  rolled over into the dining room, spoiling our experience, which is very bad management!   The food is not as good as it used to be and with the change in the garlic bread and getting rid of the Sambuca chocolate  sauce, there is no reason  to go back!",

Although we knew it was family style we figured they would have a few items you could order individually if necessary.  Nope.  One person ordered an appetizer and it was $18 - no larger than a normal appetizer at another restaurant.  The portions were fine for pasta. We got the chicken carbonara and there would have been plenty for 3-4 people.  Priced around $25 for the small. We forced someone to take leftovers but I am sure they will be chucked in the bin.  So the food was meh ... the service - well there really wasn't any.  Once our food was served the waiter flew by not stopping and asked over his shoulder if everything was ok.  He didn't slow down to wait for our reply. We sat at the table and discussed our horrible experience for about 15 minutes with all our dirty plates after we finished eating before another person who worked there came over.  Got the check, failed to put our $20 off on it. More waiting.  Also When we ordered beers he didn't ask what size so we got the big ones (we would have ordered the small) - who knew they offered two sizes.  Overall for the price and experience if you want this type of food go to Olive Garden.   I don't know how they stay in business because it was pretty empty when we were there 6:00pm on a Thursday night.  I know there are people who do love this chain - but it's not for me or the other family I was with.",

Love the restaurant, the ambiance is fun, and have always had good meals here. This week the food was so subpar. Our server (Joshua) was great - no complaints here at all. And because this was a work dinner I was not going to cause any issues with bringing up the food quality with my team present.

Again my interest is not to publicly criticize here - I am just interested in providing feedback to help address our issues.   Thank you, Bryan",

Heck, get on their email list and you'll get one every couple of weeks.  Check out my previous reviews, they still apply.  Cluttered ambiance, extensive menu, etc.  Today was a free buca small pasta with coupon.  Limited selection, but it was a full-sized buca small (which was enough for both of us with some left to take home).  Good pasta. Big, flavorful meatballs.  Sometimes simple just hits the spot, and the spaghetti marinara with the \"side\" meatball did just that.  Service here is always friendly.  Except for pizza, this is my preferred Italian place.  The pizza here is good too, but I prefer Grimaldi's if I'm going for pizza.  I keep looking for a good mom/pop place, but have yet to find one that appealed to me.  In fact, there aren't that many around at all.  Most are chains.",

That was the upside.  Here is the downside.  As you can tell from other reviews it is very pricey.  If you are looking for good Italian kitchen family style food you must go to Maggiano's, 5 star and you get a ton more food for the same price as this joint.  The service tonight was slow and I didn't expect that since we came in after the rush.  The waitress seem experienced but she only pretended to care.  She seem as if she could not be bothered by us even after we introduced ourselves as first time customers.  We ordered the Chicken Limone and it was very dry.  Enough said.  The spicy chicken (insert your favorite little Italian pasta name here) was pretty good.   My wife asked what I thought and I said it was okay but I wouldn't exactly come running back.",

    "text": "I have a confession to make before I go any further with this review: My husband and I occasionally visit chain restaurants when we really don't want to put much effort into going out to eat.  OK now that is out of my system, I can continue. We've been to Buca before (visited the location in Columbus probably about 8-10 times with friends for group dinners) so we know the concept and that it's about sharing and all that jazz. We ended up at this location on Sunday night when we were trying to find *gasp* TGI Fridays. Well let me save you a drive to this part of town and tell you that Fridays is no longer there. Anyway, we saw Buca and decided to suck it up and eat there. We had about a five minute wait and then were led back through the kitchen (as you are at any Buca) to our table. We had some confusion with our service because at one point we were told our waitress got a big party and wouldn't be handling our table anymore, and then she did for the rest of our night. Weird.  Unfortunately the food was not as good as we remembered. The cheese garlic bread was cut into squares and wasn't served in a pie shaped. The caesar salad was under-dressed, but as a plus it held up nicely as a leftover for me to have the next night for dinner. Chris thought the chicken parm was not as good as it used to be (we think they changed the recipe or something). My side of fettucini alfredo was good thankfully and heated up nicely on Tuesday night as my dinner. All and all, the food was a major disappointment even for chain restaurant standards!  The bright spot was that for $69 (includes tip) we got four meals out of the food we ordered. Buca was a 2.5 star experience for us, but I'm rounding down to 2 due to not living up to our standards.",

The meal was hosted by the in-laws and everyone enjoyed the cheese bread, penne ala vodka and my favorite penne arrabbita.    Fast forward several months....  looking for a place to pick up dinner and thought of Buca.  Only the two of us but Italian holds for left-overs better than almost any other cuisine.  Same daughter....both loved the Arrabbita previously so that's what we ordered along with a small Chopped Antipasto Salad.  The portion of 2+ is an understatement, if you're not gluttonous it probably feeds 4 easily.  The zesty sauce was as good as I remembered and plenty of sausage.  They also do not skimp on the sauce which is key if you plan on reheating it another day as we did.      The Antipasto Salad was excellent and HUGE.  This very large salad was choked with various cheeses, vegetables and lots of pepperoni.  At home I was thinking what a $9 salad looks like at other establishments and this salad is more than double or perhaps triple the size.  Great value, lots of goodies and for that alone I'll return.  I have no personal experience for eating in the restaurant but get that if you're not keen on sharing someone else's choice it could be a drag.  The pricing for two may seem high but not really as you've got food for days.  UNLESS I can't kill the salad before it turns brown and needs tossed.    Food was good and absolutely would recommend for a big outing, large group or party.  I see good value in their shared portions.  YMMV.  Oh, side note - Terrific service at the front.  Order was taken quickly, offered a drink while I waited, offered to help me out to my car, held the door, thanked me, etc etc.  Very plesant staff at Chandler!",

We ordered two large salads(antipasti and apple walnut) and a small entree for two couples. The waiter made sure we meant \"small\" and not \"large\" and seemed to be taken aback by our lack of need to gorge. The salads were good, but nothing you can't do at home...although we ALL know even a mediocre salad is better when someone ELSE makes it! The entre was sub-par. It was a \"sampler\" of a few things...that all tasted relatively the same. The stuffed shells were OVERWHELMED by the amount of fennel in the sausage.   I would have to say that the best part was the bread. The iced tea was also good.   An okay place if you want massive amounts of \"Olive Garden\"y Italian.",

The main entree ordered was burnt when the restaurant was no even busy so there was extra waiting time to wait for the entree to be ready again. When the entree was finally done it came out burnt still on the noodles. Finally when it came to the check it was about 15 to 20 minutes before we left to pay and leave. We were the only table the waitress had and she decided to prepare drinks behind the bar before giving us the check and a box for our food. So she asked another server to get the check for us. When I put my card in the billfold we had to wait for the other server to process the payment while the waitress was still making drinks. It was very poor service and I was very disappointed and confused why she put drinks before servicing her only table. Her name was Cindy and if you ever have her as your waitress there I feel sorry for you. So bottom line I do not recommend this location to go dine at. One of the managers even asked our waitress if she knew how to make a certain drink and she responded yes. Why would the manager ask her that if she was the one responsible and hired as the bartender and should know all the main drinks that need to be served. I don't plan on coming back to this location any time soon. Likely never again.",

By the time the serving plates reached those in the middle they were pretty much empty and the servers didnt bring anymore food.  Also cheesecake and cannoli were to be served for desert.  There was only enough cheesecake for half the guests and the rest had to have cannoli.  Really dissapointing.  Also, the food on the whole was just so-so...pretty much on the level of Olive Garden.

This food has been my most favorite since my sis in law always took me to this place and order the linguine de mare (seafood spaghetti that has the black mussels, clams, squids, and delicious spicy marinara sauce). It's the bomb! So I went there and order one along with black mussels. The place was really crowded on Friday nights and there's a lot of people having birthdays so we got waiters and waitress singing and clapping for birthdays songs the whole night. The free appetizer comes, bread with olive oil and vinegars. I tried to ask for butter but my waiter was kinda forgetting my request cause the poor waiter had to take order and sing the birthday songs in three tables. And finally the black mussels was arrived and its totally become my favorite food of the day. The sweetness and freshness of the mussels along with white wine, garlic and butter just gave the superb flavor away. I immediately felt in love with this food. Finally after the appetizer was gone and the black mussels too we waited again for 20 minutes until our spaghetti is coming and we already full cause of the long waiting and the appetizer. Luckily the taste of the spaghetti was still great so i don't regret my decision to wait in this place. Overall I learned my lessons to have carry out anytime I'm cracking that black mussels and seafood spaghetti.",

    "text": "The bf and I had plans for July 3rd in Ahwatukee but since the entire city was out to watch the fireworks, our plans got squashed and we decided to just grab dinner and call it a night. There wasn't a wait at buca and we were seated in their wine room. I hadn't been there in a couple of years and the bf had never been so we made some rookie mistakes. We started with an order of calamari which was really good. We decided to get two small entrees (main mistake). He had the spicy sausage with ziti dish and I had the stuffed shells. I wish our server had emphasized how big the servings are because they are giant. The two small entrees could have easily served at least four - so it is best to share a small entree if it's just two people. The two entrees were good, nothing spectacular but good. the service was good and the dinner was overall a good experience, I probably won't be back anytime soon though.",

    "text": "This place is awesome for traditional Italian food. This is a great place for a large group or a couple, all of their dishes come family style in a small or large portion. I have had their baked rigatoni with meatballs, spaghetti with meatballs, and their rigatoni with spicy Italian sausage. All of these dishes were cooked perfectly using just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs are super moist and have great flavor. Now when it comes to desserts I am always a sucker for their Tiramisu which is amazing and is great even as left overs. Overall I love coming to Buca di Beppo for a great Italian meal, they are light on the wallet even with having portions so large you are almost certain to bring home some left overs :-)",

We usually get my dad's favorite dish that is now off the menu, but they make it for us anyway. Tonight, they didn't, which is understandable because it's not on the menu anymore, but they made some weird excuse about being out of ingredients that were never present in the dish. We chose the penne San Remo, which was flavorless and not that appetizing. We barely touched it. The noodles are supposed to be al dente, which I love, but were really undercooked. A lady who I'm assuming is the manager came over to ask how are meal was, and when we told her about the hard pasta, she told us that's how they do it so next time order it another way. Funny, because we have been here plenty of times before and it was never like that??? The family next to us complained about the noodles as well, but the manager didn't seem to care. Place has gone downhill, and it's sad, because we have been coming to this place since I was a little girl. Won't be coming back.",

The food wasn't the best Italian food (and probably not the most authentic, either), but I enjoyed the aspect of sharing that the restaurant promotes.  Between eight people, we shared four small dishes and two salads, much less than the waitress-suggested four large dishes and two salads.  The entire party was quite full at the end of it, so I'm glad we got the small sizes.  One of our party had a birthday and they made an effort to make it fun for her.  The interior was a bit confusing and I got seriously lost on the way to the bathroom, but that's okay.  It's also a little intense on the eyes (read: gaudy).",

I need to say what an ANGEL Lori has been, from day one she has made everything so simple and has accommodated me in every way possible. When I went in to view the space I brought my three year old and she was so kind to him and catered top him as much as me! For a person who is pregnant  (with twins) and a stressed mom already that was just so nice.  The space was exactly what we needed and could take up to 50 guests, after we viewed the space I told Lori we would be staying for luch,  she got us the table in the kitchen with an awesome waiter and she made sure to check on us as well. The food was amazing, and so were the cannoli I am from NJ and my mom is Italian so I think I'm a pretty good judge. When I asked for the check I was told our meal was on them,  touches like this are what set a place apart when you are looking to plan a special occasion. Lori has checked in with me every step of the way,  making sure my needs are met and that I am happy and informed. I am so excited for my shower tomorrow!",

It just had no flavor, seasoning, or Italian spices to it! This is not a good place to eat at if you want real Italian food. I will not be returning.",

When the food finally came it was terrible. My daughter and her aunt got the chicken fettuccine and it was dry as a bone. We had to ask for more sauce. My chicken marsala was not good either. Also $12.95 for a piece of chocolate cake on some ones birthday is a rip off. I will not be going there again.",

We came here on Saturday night for a quick dinner.  We were seated very quickly. We got a booth in a very loud room. There were a lot of teenagers there so the noise was unreal. We could not hear the waitress, we had to yell and so did she. Our waitress was a sweet girl named Megan. She was very sorry about all the noise and said it should end soon.  2 of the tables finally left but, the one that stayed had 7 of the loudest teens I have ever experianced in a Public place.  Anyway,never mind all that.        The Food!!  So many choices to be had, We ended up by getting a mixed plate of stuffed shells and Cantonolis, It is called Quattro al Forno.  Plus we had bread first with vinegar and Olive Oil. We were not too hungry this day, so it was really a lot of food.   They have really great starters, the Calamari is fantastic. We did not have dessert but, we saw some of the desserts being brought to other tables.  The Ice Cream Sundae is huge,all served in a giant Maritini glass.   Everything is family style so keep that in mind when you order. There is a lot of food here. Great place to have a party or family get together.  The staff works really hard here, I do not know how the can do it everyday. The noise is just over the top.  Another thing that is a little differant is you walk through the Kitchen to get to the dining area. You can even make reservations to get a table in the kitchen.  Which surprised me is very popular to do.",

Not worth the price. Caesar salad was also bland, small and wilted. Totally not worth the $11. (It used to be my favorite thing at Buca, but clearly the dressing is not the same nor is the overall quality). The meatballs were \"okay\" but not the normal spectacular-ness. The quatro al forno/stuffed pasta combo plate was also okay, but nothing like it used to be. We also got some wine, a Buca Chianti, and it was also not worth the price tag. Overall the $100 price tag of this meal was a complete rip off. It was worth more like $40. We should have gone to Olive Garden -- at least you get what you pay for there.  Also the waitress didn't really seem to have any idea about the menu or current offers even though she had worked there for \"years.\" She was nice, but not very attentive. And to top it off the guests at the table next to us proceeded to yell and use tons of profanity and it was clear the employees noticed but did nothing. I don't particularly enjoy going to any restaurant and having to listen to that - nor do I want my young daughter to listen to it. And I certainly don't want to pay that much for that kind of experience.   Buca has become one of those bad cookie cutter chain restaurants. They are overpriced and the food isn't that good. You are better off choosing a chain restaurant with average or bad food and paying at least half as much.",

When we came into the restaurant, they took us through the kitchen first and all of the cooks greeted us warmly. There were a variety of \"rooms\" each with a different theme, and the host explained them to us on a short tour on the way to our seats. It was really neat!  We really liked that the meals were served family style, and they were well-priced. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the Quattro al Forno platter along with a couple of beers (because it was St. Paddy's Day, not because beer really seems to go with Italian food at all). I loved the food, especially the creamy pesto sauce that came with the stuffed mushrooms. The service was phenomenal; the waiter checked on us frequently to fill our waters and was prompt with serving our food and giving us the bill when we asked.  We came in with a $10 off a $20 meal coupon, and they'd given us two more before we left.  We would have come back anyway paying full price. I highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "A friend and I met here for lunch today and what a disappointment it was!!! She said it was her \"favorite restaurant\" and she loved one of their salads there. I would have had a better meal at McDonald's! Seriously and it wouldn't have cost me \"$85!!'\" I ordered Eggplant Parmesan for $15 and it was terrible--overcooked, burned, dry, no sauce, paper thin and the edges were so tough I could hardly cut it with my knife. The green beans were drenched in oil, salty and uncooked. I've had better eggplant parmigiana out of a frozen dinner. My friend ordered a salad for $14 and paid $4 extra for two slices of chicken in her salad that would typically go for $12-13 any where else--here it was $18! My friend wanted to order a carafe of sangria; she remembered it as being really good from the last time she was there. Wrong! The first carafe tasted like water so we sent it back. The waitress remade the sangria. The manager came by and asked if it was better. I replied no, not much at all. When the bill came, we were shocked!!! The frickin carafe of lousy watered down sangria cost $28!!! There was no alcohol in the sangria at all. Couldn't even taste any juice. Just tasted like water. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for ripping people off for their terrible sangria!! We were dumbfounded and could not believe the price!! Altogether our bill came to a whopping $75 and $10 for the tip so $85 for a lousy lunch at Buca di Beppo! Save your money! Go to Trader Joe's and buy their frozen eggplant parmigiana--it's to die for--and it doesn't cost $15!",

The people next to us threw an absolute fit Bc their garlic bread didn't come out with the appetizer but with their meal instead. (Who cares...it isn't  that big of a deal is what I thought) they were so upset they had the house bread instead of their garlic bread with their appetizer! They called him a jack ass and was completely out of line! They told the manager Ortestis he was a joke. Ortesis and Travis both handled it professionally and graciously. I don't know if I could have exercised that kind of patience.   I hope those people aren't allowed back as no one deserves to be spoken to with that kind of disrespect. They even apologized to us for having us have to witness the whole ordeal. I didn't mind I just felt awful for them because they did nothing wrong. Our food as always was delicious and exceeded our expectations. Will definitely return and recommend more people to this location!",

Wall filled with pictures and painting from yesteryears. It didnt appeal to me much.   We ordered garlic bread, vegetarian pizza, eggplant parmigiana and spicy veg rigatoni. The garlic bread was alright and had too much of whole garlic pieces on top of the bread. It was like eating just garlic alone. The vegetarian pizza was awful and didnt taste good. There was too much broccoli. The hit on the table was the eggplant parmigiana and spicy veg rigatoni. Eggplant was breaded and fried, it was topped with tomato based sauce and tasted delicious. Rigatoni pasta was one of the best I have had, the sauce was delicious and we wanted to just go on eating.   Any one who visits this place should know the quantity is huge. Overall a good place to go with a huge crowd and the price is average.",

They sat us.... a couple in the center of four crowded kid tables with kids kicking my seat the whole time while half the restaurant was empty. So loud my girl couldn't hear anything I was saying.   I ordered a beer and it wasn't flat but close and it wasn't warm but close   The appetizer was the only good point. It was a mozzarella caprese. Ate the whole thing. Then we had a bland spaghetti with meat balls. The meat balls weren't dry but hmmm.   So maybe dessert will take us to the promise land.  Nope two bites of the tiramisu and I couldn't think of taking a third. Wife gave it an it's ok. Not good not bad.   They gave our waitress a 10 top on the other side the restaurant so here we sit surrounded by kids with limited service.   Won't be back.",

Then was told it would be 10-15 minute wait to seated.     The restaurant was not even half full.  When I asked what was going take so long, the older man behind the Host Station  said they had limited staff working.  It's a Friday night ......... maybe hire a bartender and more staff for what is usually the busiest night of the week?  We left and went to Spinato's Pizzeria on Chandler Blvd.  After we arrive I was glad Buca wasn't serving  at the bar and had a 10-15 minute wait for a half full restaurant.  Spinato's pizza was perfect, beer was cold and couldn't have been happier with the service.  Now off to write a 5 - Star review for Spinato's Pizzeria!",

The next best thing about this location is the manager Robert. He came over talked with us for a while. Never rushed away and made you feel like we were long time friends. He even gave my daughter a dessert to take back home with her. Robert is a great asset to this establishment!",

Although it took some time to get a table for myself and my counterpart (spur of the moment so no reservation), the host was extremely friendly. He even switched us to a different table when requested.   The food was fantastic and definitely exceeded my expectations. I am a picky eater as was my guest and he had little to no complaints (aside from comparisons to options in New York). I highly recommend the bruschetta, the penne a la vodka was great as well. There is also a platter that contained ravioli and a few other types of cheese stuff items. Phenomenal.   Overall the service was great and worth the wait.",

The whole place is in need of a major renovation and brought into 2019. I was quite disappointed with how many pictures are up of half naked women. Isn't this suppose to be a \" family \" restaurant?? I guess I'm old school when it comes to taking my 8, 6, 4 year old to dinner that we all don't need bombarded with these pictures to look at while eating dinner. But I guess to some people it doesn't matter.... To those people , enjoy your dinner, for me....I'll take my kids somewhere else to enjoy an Italian dinner with tasteful decor.",

I always order the carbonara and always finish my meal with some delicious limoncello. It hits the spot every time. Stacey is hands down the best! Her menu knowledge is on point. The way that she describes something is exactly how it is. She always gives us exactly what we need even without asking, makes sure that she checks in on us and it's not overwhelming. She definitely makes our experience worth coming. Even remembers our names and what we like to drink! She is always smiling and always in a good mood and you can tell that shes happy to be there. Which obviously radiates on to her customers. If you'd like some good spaghetti and meatballs? Definitely try this place out. It's worth it, trust me.

What was most disappointing was the manager's response (or lack thereof). He came out, circled around them a bit, but said nothing.

    "text": "We like Buca for informal family gatherings.  Going to Buca means everyone will find SOMETHING they like.  It means we will have leftovers.  It means we won't have to clean up after ourselves.    The quality of Buca noticeably deteriorated after Planet Hollywood took over.  We'd been going to Buca for years in various states and things we loved started to disappear.  For example, Buca used to give you really good complimentary rosemary focaccia when you sat down.  Now they give you a semi-crusty white bread with zero flavor.  What do you want to bet they started selling more garlic bread and bruschetta when they stopped giving you the good free stuff?!  The portion sizes also changed noticeably.   Still, you always have enough to eat (or more than enough).  You always also have a good time.  How can you not?  We always look forward to seeing the old pictures... especially of old Italian movie stars, The Pope and various mischievous children.    Is this the best, most authentic Italian food around?  No.  But they do have a lot of Italian-American classics that your family will surely enjoy.  I can't give it a 4 stars due to commonly having received extra slow service (due to the kitchen) on busy nights and usually having a wait even with a reservation.  But the food is definitely better than, say, Chili's or other like-priced places.  It's served family style for the most part, but you CAN get individual portions of most things at lunch.    Want a tip?  If you're craving spaghetti but you don't want to order a full portion, you can order the SIDE of spaghetti for only $5.99!  It is about 1/2 to 2/3 the size of the small spaghetti at a fraction of the price.",

    "text": "On Saturday September 2nd my family and I decided to go eat here. Now if you have eaten here before you already know the bill is going to be well over $100 if appetites are packed, but the food is so good and the portions are so large it is considered money well spent. Staff was great. Although our Sangria was  watered down,the replacement was satisfactory. Some portions of the $27 appetizer were either under or over cooked. Main dishes were good. However, when my aunt and I made our way to the ladies room we were left completely and utterly disturbed. Now we all know that public restrooms are always in question as far as cleanliness, but their restroom made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up! Not only was it poorly maintained, The toilet seats look like acid is eating away at them.  Water pressure so low that it not only leaves previous toilet paper stuck to the  bowl but also the previous persons defecation. 1st stall. GROSS!. 2nd stall OMG!!. 3rd stall SERIOUSLY!!! I doubled back to the 1st stall mad because I needed to go and had no other choice. Before I knew it my aunt too realized the madness and was waiting to use the stall that I was in. As we were walking out my level of being confounded grew. I turned around, went back inside, and asked for  a manager. Apologetic, yes, sympathetic, no, I felt his words were just that ... words coming out of his mouth. There was no True embarrassment and certainly no remorse. I left feeling like either he has heard this before  enough so to be numb to the fact or he simply didn't care of my opinion. Well at least not enough to rectify it! $145 spent and my feelings are now Bucca Who?",

Of course we went during I'm guessing prom night...which on a side note when did prom start to look like a bunch of strippers running around? Wow. Anyway it was really busy, but no huge wait time. Seated promptly and began to look over the menu.  Our server was amazing and very quick with everything, and had excellent communication and was really friendly and prompt even with the onslaught of teens next to us.  Anyway, someone accidentally picked up our order sho we had to wait a moment more which was perfectly fine in my opinion. Food was good, but we both felt it could use a little more sauce. Ordered a cocktail, which was good, boozy, and of course came with a souvenir glass. I don't live that idea, cuz I really don't even want a souvenir glass from an actual destination place, but oh well. At the end when our bill came, they had taken of the entire entree because we had to wait so long. I was stunned. I really want even upset about the wait, however I.appreciate it because it makes me want to be a repeat customer. So thank you for providing customer service and we shall return!",

    "text": "What a disappointment! My husband and I live a half mile away from this restaurant and I have been telling him how good Buca is and that we needed to eat there. Finally last night, my husband agreed to have dinner there. We were promptly seated in the bar area, initially they were going to seat us in a small two top, the place was virtually empty so we asked if we could please have a booth. Which the hostess grudgingly allowed us. Our waiter, Adam stopped by and asked us if we wanted to order drinks and an appetizer. So we said yes, we ordered a glass of wine each and the small caprese which was 15.00 for five slices! What? We also ordered a small salad and the chicken rigatoni Nero style. Our waiter acted like he was too busy to pay attention to our table. We snagged him and asked for bread, which he said he would bring later because it was in the oven. It's dinner time, why wasn't the bread ready? When he finally brought the bread he left it at the edge of the large table and left a small bowl with merely a splash of olive oil and balsamic. And also left it on the edge of the table where we couldn't reach it. We had to go around to the other side to bring the bread and balsamic in front of us. We had to chuckle because there was only enough olive oil and balsamic for each of us to dip once. Our waiter was MIA so my husband got up to go get more. The bartender saw him and kindly said that he would get more for us, which he did. We only received one plate each that was to accommodate our appetizer, our bread and our salad. We were surprised that we had to use the same plate for all three. Our waiter made cursory walk bys without stopping to check on us. When our entree arrived, we were presented with clean plates. Items were dropped at the table without even an acknowledgement of our existence. The Chicken Rigatoni had good flavor only because we asked for it extra spicy, but the pasta was not done and there was so little chicken included in the dish. We literally had one or two bites if chicken each on our 23.00 chicken rigatoni entree.  When our bill was presented to us, and when I say presented, I mean dropped on the table, we were shocked. We each had <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fone.glass&s=2edbe7df6f25c0f5e68ec7ac9a98a0f6aeb438b82eeacadf6deb8c359e78007d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">one.glass</a> of wine and they were 15.00 each; we did not expect that. This meal totaled out at 91.85, not including tip. We decided even if we didn't eat the leftovers that we sure in the heck were taking them with us. We asked for 'to go' containers and they were literally thrown on the table. I had to laugh because I was so shocked that our server couldn't be bothered to plate our leftovers in the containers.  We still each had wine in our glass, so again we weren't going to leave that liquid gold behind, so we sat and finished it. I have been to a couple of different Buca Di Beppo's before and had good experiences, however this location was horrible and I will never ever return here or to any other location. Way overrated when food is not the quality of the price charged and when the service is so bad that you actually have to laugh and not get mad. The only light was that the bartender, Jason was helpful and friendly. Perhaps he could give Adam a few tips in service.",

Anyway; last night me and my boyfriend came in for dinner for his birthday. It was slow and it took us 10 minutes to get seated(which happens every time we are here.) The hostess seemed stressed out and clearly did not want to help us lol. She asked us if we wanted a table or large booth so we just chose the booth because it was offered. When we sat down it was clear she was annoyed that we chose the larger booth. She tossed us our menus and told us our server would be right with us. Our server Jenevieve also seemed stressed out and we felt very un welcomed. While ordering she would cut us off and wouldn't let us finish the name of the entree/'appetizer we were getting, which was rude. When she brought the bread and oil&vinegar, she placed our plate of oil as far away from us as possible, behind the table tent that was on our table. (I can't make this stuff up). Anyway, our food came out in a timely manner, however it wasn't until I mentioned we would be having dessert for his birthday, that she turned her attitude around. She suddenly put a smile on her face, (which I'm guessing was because us ordering dessert was the cherry on top of her tab), and was so cheery and pleasant. I love this damn food but we hate dealing with the shitty service. Oh- this is also from 2 people who work in food, and me being a manager in the industry myself. Get your sh*t together.",

Perfect place to have a party, in fact I had my college graduation party here a few years back and it was a blast.  Place was designed for family sized gatherings.  My only gripe is that this place is not really designed for one or two people.  In smaller groups the bill seems very high and the portions seem to be a bit lacking, your wallet can take a real beating if you want to have a diverse experience.  Still I give this place a big thumbs up, just make sure you book a party and visit the pope room.",

    "text": "We visited the restaurant in Chandler AZ on Ray road Sunday February 12th with my friends.  I must say that every time we go back there we are more and more disappointed.  The value of the food vs. the cost just is just ridiculous and the taste, well lets just say it used to be a lot better.  Another very disappointing thing is that when I tried to order a non alcoholic strawberry dakari, I was informed  that they could not serve it to me at the table and I would have to go to the bar and drink it if I wanted it.  I ask you, what kind of crap is that?  If I ordered a coke or lemonade they could served it at my table or even a regular dakari with alcohol but that was not what I wanted.  They told me some story that I believe to be nothing but BS about the liquor laws, and found out I was right too.  To confirm this, I just had dinner at The Keg restaurant in Chandler, yes the same city governed by the same laws as the Buca I ate at on Sunday, and I was informed by the manager that to his knowledge there was no such law in Chandler or AZ.  He even confirmed that with another manager.  I got my non alcoholic dakari with my dinner at my table.  Sometimes I can over look bad food or even bad service from a restaurant but I have a hard time overlooking being lied to!  The only good thing I can say about our visit Sunday night was that all the employees there were really nice.  They lied to us but at least they did it with a smile on their face.",

All yummy!   What were my favorites?  The bruschetta served in a giant martini glass! Both beautiful and delicious! The chicken Marsala (my favorite since they stopped serving the veal Marsala!). The dessert/birthday sundae, also served in a giant martini glass. Enough for all 8 of us!   Service was top-notch.  A fun evening for all!",

Waitress was attentive and warm, yet not overbearing with check-ins (one of my pet peeves).  Highly recommend this place for group dining.

I love that Bucca gives you a tour of the whole restaurant and brings you through the kitchen to see where your food is prepared, you actually can even be seated in the kitchen if you want. The decor is beautiful and the food was meh. The pasta I ordered was very bland and just tasted like oil. Had no flavor what so ever. I had ordered the Shrimp Florentine. The shrimp was ok but bland once again. We also had calamari that was over cooked and burnt and just nasty. Luckily the dessert made up for our whole experience. My boyfriend ordered a chicken carbonara that was decent but slightly undercooked but it was okay. ( presentation wise our food looked great, just wished it tasted as great!) In terms of price what we got wasn't worth it. Since our food was either undercooked or way to over cooked to eat. I would come to bucca again but most likely order something else.",

I had made a reservation by phone weeks earlier. The good news is that we were seated immediately. The long tables where other large parties were dining were a bit close together. We were almost back-to-back with the table next to us. The sound level was also pretty loud, but I guess that's to be expected on a busy holiday.   Our server, Caitlin, was superior. She was friendly and fast. We ordered two large turkey meals with all the fixings and it came out pretty quickly. She was very accommodating and we enjoyed her quick wit. Five stars for Caitlin!  My review of the food is based on a family vote as I think it's the only fair way to do it. I would rate it at least an 8 out of 10,  but the family votes were much lower.  Here is what they said: Turkey - a bit on the dry side, but I thought it was perfect. Green beans - they say so-so, but I thought they were delicious. Mashed potatoes - everyone loved them. Stuffing was the lowest ranked as it was very salty. Besides, for more than 50 years we have enjoyed my grandmother's traditional stuffing. To us, nothing compares. We had leftovers to bring home as portion sizes were pretty big. There is value there!  Of course the best part was not having to do dishes for an hour an cleaning up. To me, it was totally worth it. I didn't miss the mess or the time spent cooking. For the price (averaging $44 pp including tax) it's not a bad deal. It all depends on what you want.

    "text": "I barely even know where to start with this Review, especially as someone who has been coming here for years! The service here was the ABSOLUTE WORST service I've ever experienced in my entire life and I've been to quite a few restaurants. It also sucks to have to write this after going here for my birthday dinner tonight. First off, after arriving here with only ONE other person, we were told by the hostess it would be a 15 minute wait. We wound up waiting almost 25 after the manager of the restaurant came out into the lobby from the back and asked a party of 3 how many they had and proceeded to go find them a table even though they had JUST WALKED IN! After we were finally seated, I went to go to the restroom and was gone for probably 4-5 minutes. After I came back to the table our waiter Travis walked up and told us \"I'll be right with you for your drinks\" and left to tend to other tables. That was the FIRST time he came to our table. That was the first red flag. Then after coming back to get our drink order, and bringing us our drinks, he forgot to hand us straws, which wasn't a big deal until he proceeded to be gone from our table FOR ANOTHER 5 minutes. So by this time, we've sat at our table for 15 minutes without even having placed a food order. After he finally came back to get our food order, he hadn't brought any house bread to our table and we sat at our table for any 5-6 minutes still with no food. 2nd red flag. Finally, the manager who we had seen in the lobby, brings out our appetizer, slams it on the table and walks away so fast we couldn't even get a request for straws in. What the actual BLEEP! By this time we both were obviously frustrated. On top of everything, the garlic bread we had ordered, we had specifically asked to be brought out with our caprese appetizer so we could eat it together and it didn't get brought until 15 effing minutes after our caprese AND WE STILL HADNT BEEN GIVEN A SINGLE THING OF HOUSE BREAD. When the garlic bread finally came out, we asked the manager who brought it out for us to bring us house bread, which mind you is usually served with Oil and Balsamic Vinegar. When the manager brought our house bread, he brought no oil and vinegar with him and by this point, we were both livid. We've sat at our table for over 30 minutes with drinks that have no straws, house bread with no oil and vinegar and a waiter who never even bothered to ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks until we were ALREADY DONE with our food. Absolutely. Awful. I cant even wrap my mind around someone who is given a manager position in a restaurant who slams food on our table and can't even ask if we need anything. The whole point of good service is making sure your table has everything they need and visiting your table more than TWO TIMES in a 30 minute span of time. Horrid service, horrid management and horrid restaurant in general. I wish I could give negative stars. DONT COME HERE! If you want good Italian food with good customer service, go to Sauce or Carrabbas across the street. This place and its old dude manager ORTESTIS are a JOKE!",

    "text": "So I decided to give this place a try even though I knew it had mediocre Yelp reviews. And honestly, I had a gift card so I kinda had to go to get rid of it. So we walk in, and there is no host. After a few minutes, someone appears and takes us to our table. She tells us we are the 3rd table of the day. They walk you through the \"kitchen\" which I find to be odd and quite frankly, a little disturbing. I don't know if this is a real kitchen or just for show. I don't really like the idea of guests walking through a food prep area. I don't see how that can be sanitary, not to mention dangerous.  The dining room is very large and cutely decorated. Looks just like Grandma's place back in Jersey. Must be authentic, right? More on that later. We sat in a booth and let me tell you, I've never felt so many 2 x 4's underneath me! The seat was not comfortable. So there is one couple eating quietly, now us, and a party of about 12 not too far from where we are sitting. I guess they think they have the whole place to themselves because they were so loud and obnoxious. This place requires you to order \"family style\" which basically means if you don't want to take out a second mortgage, you better agree upon what to order because it's expensive! The small portion says it feeds 1-3 people, but that's not entirely accurate.  Oh, and everything here is a la carte, meaning you are paying for everything separately.  So we decide on the chopped anti pasta salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and garlic bread.  Took forever to get our drinks and we were only the 3rd table. Finally, the salad arrives. It's plenty for 3 people. Good flavor. I didn't like that everything was so tiny, hence, chopped. Looked like they put everything in a food processor. It would've been better with more salami and olives, but not bad. I need to mention that the dishes here look well past their prime. Even though I'm sure they were clean, they look like they've been around for 100 years. Time to donate to the shelter and get some clean dishes. What are supposed to be white plates look dingy and grey with black marks. Yuck. Kinda sets the tone. Ok folks, the spaghetti and meatballs come out. TWO meatballs. This is supposed to feed up to three people. So the third person doesn't get a meatball? Strange.  Anyway, the \"marinara\" sauce was awful. It was basically just stewed tomatoes with runny liquid. Even the waitress commented that she was going to bring us a bowl of extra sauce. More of the same. Probably would've been better with a bowl of chips and labeled salsa. It was nothing  like  marinara sauce.  The meatballs were very bland. Could've used some onion or garlic or any seasoning! The garlic bread was plentiful, but again, no flavor. The only good thing about it was that it had what appeared to be garlic chunks on it, but it needed salt or seasoning and more butter, oil or whatever was supposed to be on there. The server was nice enough to comp the spaghetti and meatballs after she asked us if we liked it and we said no. Unexpected, but a nice gesture on her part. The overall service was slow and drinks were not refilled in a timely manner. Overall, the ambience is great. It looks Italian. The food, not so great. Be prepared to drop some serious coin. If I were you, I'd choose one of the nearby mom and pop Italian joints for a fraction of the price. Unless of course you were cursed with a gift card also.",

The spaghetti and meatballs bleh worst marinara sauce I've had in a long time. The rosemary potatoes tasted sweet and very very dry.

As soon as we were seated, the server came to us and said the only sauce we can serve you today is Marinara. Yes, Marinara! They were out of any Alfredo sauce.  I couldn't help but joke about how they didn't mention this before seating us.   (If I wanted a marinara sauce pasta - I would rather have it at home!).  About 15 mins later, he came out and had found that they had a secret stash of sauce which they would serve for one small dish - one small dish for 8 people.  We decided we had to compromise for another large dish w marinara sauce.  As soon as he served us dinner, we requested a Kids meal of Chicken Parmesan - only to find out that their kitchen had supposedly closed well before we got our meals - he somehow had forgotten to warn people about the kitchen closing soon.  That's when he said our only option for additional food would be House bread or desert, which we weren't served on being seated.  A few minutes into our meal, he stopped by to wrap things up.  An extremely disappointing experience, the only positive being the tiramisu, which is why we give it a single star than none.  We've love hosting large parties at this particular Buca but our experience at this graduation dinner was extremely disappointing; especially when they call themselves the Home of Graduation parties.  I would have to think before choosing this place for dinner.",

We went for dinner after the dinner rush at 7pm, this place was super noisy to the point where we couldn't have a conversation with people at the table. Seemed like they were seating by the rooms vs by server, so once one room was filled up they would seat in another area.   My biggest complaint is that I ordered Veal Marsala, my veal was VERY overcooked and tough to even cut into, I did tell our server who swapped out for Chicken Marsala however it took them about 40 minutes and by the time I was super annoyed and not hungry let alone my friends and family were already finished eating. Also, two people at my table ordered meatballs, they were also overcooked and came to the table luke warm, they were not eaten and asked to be taken off the bill. The manager said that the meatballs were boiled and probably at the bottom of the pot and not stirred.   Christina was our server and probably the ONLY thing positive I can say was that she was very sweet and accommodating however I would suggest giving this girl a promotion to manager as the manager who came to speak with us never introduced himself, had a bad attitude and did the bare minimum by taking the meatballs and Marsala off the bill but his attitude wasn't one of a manager should have. The only way I knew his name was that his initials are on the bill and it on the door.   And for a suggestion.....it would be really nice if they offered gluten-free pasta for those of us with allergies since they are a pasta establishment. I had 5 things to choose from, and 3 of those I couldn't eat...you know the rest of the two other options. Meh!",

I ordered the same meal, the Buca Trio Platter. I was a little hesitant to order the same thing that made me sick before but they were assuring me it was going to be good.  I the mozzarella triangles aren't bad for frozen food. The stuffed mushrooms weren't as wet as last time but this time my biggest issue was the calamari. Last time I ate it, it made me sick, and had food poisoning. This time around, wasn't much better. It didn't make me sick but half of it was cold and the other half was hot. This tells me that they were cooked at different times.  I'm sorry to staff at Bucca but I still give it one star as the food was not good and the chefs must not care about the quality of their food.",

The service was great and our waiter was very good about coming back to check on us even though there was a huge party on the other side of the restaurant that he was also assisting. Good service.  The food was okay. We got the Quattro Forno dish which is four different kinds of stuffed shells including manicotti, ravioli, shells and canolli. The food was cooked well and it had good flavor but it was not anything that I would go out of my way to have again. We also got a small order of cheesy garlic bread which could have stood to be cooked a little longer. It tasted good but got cold really fast and no one likes cold bread.  I do not recommend coming here with just two people. The family style dishes are huge even if you just get one small order between two people. They probably gave us 20 large pieces of garlic bread which we definitely could not finish and garlic bread does not reheat well so I felt like I was just wasting it. I would recommend coming here with a party of four or more.  Not sure if I will be back. Maybe if I have a large party and we need a lot of food for a certain occasion.",

Great starters.   The atmosphere is nice and definitely feels like family place which I like.   I wish I can maybe give 3 1/2 stars just because of the past experiences that were good and some okay and some that were..eh...it's alright.  Also, what happened to the Angelo pizza?

Twice came without chicken and all twice with the bread being super cold as taken out of a freezer recently. One time came swimming in sauce and it became disgusting to eat.   I called the restaurant for one of the occasions. They didn't act if it was important or a big deal. They refunded me only after I requested and it took over a day. I was told someone would call me back to follow up and I received no calls.   If you are in business to serve people their meals, you should take a little extra precautions that the food is done correctly. I should not have to get home with hungry kids and have items missing. This should never happen twice or even a third time.   It seems to me that this Bucca di Beppo is careless with the food they serve and how they treat their customers.",

Got home to find a salad with no dressing so useless (called to have it take off the bill which they said they would do), cold chicken limone (probably because we also ordered baked ziti which was a bit warmer and they didn't time things with that dish in mind), a side of fettucini alfredo that was tasteless paste that went straight into the trash, and an OK slice of cake. Almost $90 dinner. Regret giving the $5 tip. Rigatony's is much better.",

We specifically told the waitress that we had an allergy to pork and requested that the dish that we ordered be served without pork. Bailey later came back after 10 minutes stating that they currently aren't serving the Mount Vesuvius, she didn't offer any alternative desserts either. I became upset at this point because she should have informed us before that they weren't serving it at the beginning. We were in the middle of eating our chicken when we realized that there was pork inside it. We brought this to the attention of our waitress Bailey and she apologized and took all our plates which had our baked rigatoni. We were very disappointed that she didn't ownership of her mistake and the fact that she took most of the rigatoni as well. The least that she could have done was gave us another serving to make up for that. We decided that she didn't deserve a tip after that ordeal. When we went to the bathroom,she later followed me and my friends and screamed at us for giving her a $0.00 tip. This made us very upset, we couldn't believe she had the nerve to scream at us over the tip when she wasn't a good waitress. After this horrible experience, we will never go to Buca di Beppo again and have told friends and family not to dine at this restaurant.",

From my experiences w Bucca i knew the food had much to be desired so I sought the advice from my fellow Yelpers on what to order, maybe there was something i was missing out out on. So i tried the Ceasar salad that someone said was the best they'd ever had, which makes me sad for her. It was far from the best, the lettuce was wilted and soggy. I went on my own for the main dish. I forgot the name of it, but it was a spicy shrimp pasta dish. It was pretty good. My son ordered the fetticcini Alfredo. The sauce was clumpy and lacked flavor. Decided to try the highly recommended tiramisu. I was expecting a slice but got a huge bowl (i know, duh I'm at Bucca). Again it was ok. Nothing to rave about. Then again i doubt anything can beat the tiramisu that i had at an Italian Deli in San Fran.  Overall... service and food was, like i said, eh.",

We were 'guided' through the kitchen as usual an placed our order...to our sad disappointment.  The Shrimp Scampi was vapid, pasty, and totally dismal.  There's supposed to be, at least a good hint of garlic and herbs in the dish. This one was nearly odorless. They smiled and we accepted the offer to remake it. The second try had some sauce on it but it was still pathetic. They removed the charge for that dish from the bill because we could not eat it.

Family style meals and lots of pasta are two of my favorite things, but recently the service has been lacking and they seem to overwork 1 waiter to the brink of meltdown.

I remembered the bread being warm and soft but it was neither this time around which is disappointing. The seafood trio platter was ok and I think it was suppose to come with marinara sauce on the side but we did not get that. I then ordered a salad, custom pasta and salmon to share with my family. The food was ok and well plated but it didn't stand out. Overall I felt the experience underwhelming and I feel that the management needs to do something about the short wait staff.",

I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat.   We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking.   We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back.   We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it.   The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service.   So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.",

Lori is the sales manager, and she was extremely helpful. After we placed the order online back in September, she called and emailed to introduce herself and to make sure I had her contact incase we needed it closer to the trip. Then, she reviewed all of the dishes to make sure that they would be okay for the 3 swimmers on our team who have severe nut allergies.  The order was delivered on time, with the plates and serving-ware that we requested. Everything ran smoothly, the food was great, and the service was better than most of my catering experiences.   I have used this business in Chandler in years past and the service was nowhere near as good as it was this year. I believe that Lori is new and she made all the difference in making sure that we had a great experience.",

Went on Sunday at around 6pm. Every other restaurant around Bucca had a wait, not a long one (Cheesecake factory was 30 min) but it looks like people are starting to avoid this place. When we walked in there was nobody waiting and there was barely any tables taken. I didn't understand why i had to wait a couple minutes to be seated, but hey I'm not a hostess and I don't have the scoop on the availability of waiters on a weekend during dinner hour in one of the busiest areas of the west valley. Once me and my girlfriend got seated we waited approximately 15 minutes to receive our drinks followed by another 5-10 min for bread. Our order was fairly easy today (small pizza, small order of fettuccine alfredo). We got our meal about 20 minutes after ordering, which is fairly reasonable and i was happy about that. But, the fettuccine was cold and you could clearly tell our waitress forgot since someone else had to bring it to us. We ate our meal and decided to save most of it for left overs. Then, this is where the turn happened. Once done we pushed our plates away and waited for our waitress to come back so that we could order desert and get to go containers. After 30 minutes we finally see her and she went straight to a table that had just been seated took their order and walked away. All while i waived to flag her down and said \"excuse me miss\" she walked away. I saw to go containers in the waiter station next to me and took the liberty of grabbing them to box myself. It wasn't until she brought the other tables food back that we finally saw her and asked for the check, which took about another 10 minutes to do.  Basically, if you have alot of time on your hands and have nothing else better to do than this is the place for you. I really enjoy the food here, however the service you have to deal with is mediocre at best. They pay no attention and i received the same exact service 2-3 months ago. I even sat in the same booth. It could be just the area of the restaurant we get stuck in but after two times i'm skeptical. I want to go back and give this place another shot but part of me doesn't want to waste my money.  I would highly advise just ordering to go instead of putting up with their staff, because the pizza is very good. 2 stars for the pizza.",

From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.  Our party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.    I was really very pleased.",

The server / bartender was attentive and our complaint is not against her.   Our entree was delivered and the standard \"the dish is very hot\" warning was given. While on the surface the cheese and sauces appeared hot - one bite into the items tasted like luke warm pasta / meat / cheese. And \"luke warm\" is a stretch. More like room temperature.   Totally ruined the expectation of a quality meal.   Yes, the manager was contacted and we were comped.   We were also offered the opportunity to return on another occasion for additional comped meals. But, honestly - we are just done.   Would rather go somewhere else.",

    "text": "So so so disappointed. We went in tonight on Thanksgiving expecting to have a great dinner and experience, but... Let's start with the good, the food was delicious, well most of it. We started with the calamari and antipasto salad, the salad was absolutely delish,  the calamari was served in a large beer goblet, the top was good, the bottom was unedible, as all the grease settles to the bottom and the calamari was just greasy, the breading was completely gone, therefore it was not crispy deliciousness. We also had the Penne al Forno and the baked rigatoni, both were very very good. We finished with the Italian cream cake, also very good.  As for the cocktails, the cranberry splash and buca bella was good, the salerno(?) was just ok. The service was absolutely horrible, I believe our server was Marcus, we had to ask for bread, side plates, olive oil, refills, he only removed 1 thing from the table, the calamari goblet, we had to push everything to the end of the table for him to take , PLUS, we had to ask him to actually clear the table so we could have some elbow room to eat our dessert, he brought the dessert and forks and left, we had to flag him down yet again to get napkins. He never refilled our empty water glasses, or asked if we would like them refilled, just awful. I'm sure he was not happy with the tip, but you get what you actually earn. He was not pleasant, friendly, or engaging in any way. Go for the food, but if you end up with Marcus, ask to have a different server!!",

On one occasion, they didn't even inform us they canceled the order. I had to call the delivery service to inquire where my order was an hour later, and they called Buca. They were told \"their internet was down\" and never received the order.  Yet, I received an e-mail confirming the order which requires the restaurant to accept the order for it to be confirmed. This suggests they accept a lot of orders and when they can't fulfill them, they conveniently cancel them at the last minute.   I love their food but this location is not particularly managed well and these types of tactics are not appreciated. I absolutely would not trust ordering food from them using any App or delivery service.",

    "text": "My family had made reservations for 5:00 on Wednesday right after Hamilton High School's 2017 Graduation. I had to call and request to change the reservation time to 5:30 and ( I want to say her name was Debra ) was quite happy and unbothered to make the change!  Granted it was only a thirty minute difference, but people give attitude for a lot less! My brother and I saved the table for our entire group, and our waiter Kyle got all the seats water, and lots of starter plates for the house bread and salad. My brother noticed that the wood that was at the top of his seat still had wood cleaner/polish/stain on it, and it was coming off at the touch, or was sticky and tacky feeling. When my family arrived, we addressed it with Kyle who was severely apologetic, and offered to help us switch tables, which we didn't think necessary, we just asked for some rags or for some napkins to wipe it off ourselves. Kyle brought back some towel and climbed into the booth behind us, and started scrubbing down the wood himself. It was very kind, as we just wanted to at least take it off the areas where clothing or whatever else would bump into it. Kyle was a very attentive waiter, and very accommodating, also clearing any empty plates, offering refills, knowing the menu and portion sizes very well.  During the middle to end of our meal, a gentleman walked up to our table and addressed himself as the Manager of the restaurant . His name is Rick Yumanovich, and he was absolutely wonderful. Extended his apologies for the stain on the wood, and gave us his personal business card in case any of our clothes were affected because of the stain. We assured him that it was no big deal, and there was no harm done and no hurt feelings. When we were wrapping up and receiving to go boxes for the DELICIOUS food that was provided, Kyle asked if we wanted to get dessert or not, and based off the portions and many breads and salads we said no. He walked away and came back and said that the Manager would absolutely not take no for an answer, and was going to give us the Dolce Platter free of charge for the inconvenience of the wood stain. This location knows customer service. They treated us so kindly for something that we honestly did not even find to be a big deal at all! I am not a huge fan of italian food myself, but I would come back to support such a great business with wonderful management that care about their customers!",

My husband and I planned a special evening full of over indulging and reminiscing of our simple childhood. We placed our orders and waited in anticipation for a delicious meal. While waiting for our food, we also waited for our drinks. Our glasses were empty, with no server in sight. We patiently waited for a drop water, anything to quench our thirst. The food finally showed up, and was delicious. After our meal, the waitress was quick to interrupt our special evening, as if to rush us out the door. I had to remind her that it was my brothers birthday, even though I made reservations the day before. They sang happy birthday and brought out ice cream....and then....ANTS! The ants were marching across the table! We tipped over the sugar container, and there they were. The manager offered us a free dessert, really? After spend over $200, we could get ONE free dessert, after we already ordered and paid for dessert for 6 people? To say that I am disappointed, is an understatement. I am giving two stars, only because the food was delicious. The service was sub par at best, and the cleanliness of the restrooms and eating area was beyond unnaceptable. I would not recommend the Chandler location. I did not invite Antman to our dinner.",

Whatever ....,,,they had already closed the bar which was wrapped in plastic wrap from head to toe ? Weird...we kinda wanted to sit at the bar .... but as we sit down are server was nice I guess but defiantly already thought he was done for the night and appeared to be a little all over the place .. He brought us ice cold bread and we ordered a 40$ shrimp Parmesan . We get the plate minutes later and it's a giant plop of Goo. Now we were planing on paying 40$ for this so we figure it would have been like any other pasta dish with noodles ? Nope just a 40$ plop of cheese and frozen breaded shrimp . I ask about noodles and he says I can buy some for 12$ . We decide to eat it as is and first bite I spit it out . The shrimp are as chewy as beef jerkey and the plate is such a giant blob of god knows what it taste like dog food . We end up sending it back . The server dosent care . Next second we see him he has already taken off his work shirt and he's clearly over it . The kitchen was already wrapped in plastic wrap as well. Given it still isn't even 10 yet . I will say he bought my bf\"s beer , we still tipped him 20% anyways but this was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant given I was about to pay 40$$$$$ for a plop of melted cheese and some frozen breaded shrimp . I went to in and out burger instead and will never ever go back here ever and will tell anyone else to go anywhere else that's how horrible my experience was .",

There is enough variety that even the pickiest eaters will find something good.  The mood is pretty festive every time we go, and everyone meets and greets you with a smile.  My favorite item here so far is the linguine frutti di mare.  It comes with a flavorful tomato sauce and is packed with various seafood, which makes it a good deal for the price.  Last time I went it was in celebration of my mother's birthday, who likes to have the waiters sing to her on her birthday.  I mentioned that it was my mother's birthday in the comments section of the Opentable reservation site, and I mentioned it to the waitress right before ordering our dessert (No free dessert for birthdays, but they do sing for you, she said), but no one ever came to sing for her.  We felt a little disappointed, but the tiramisu dessert we did have was rich, creamy, and quite tasty.",
