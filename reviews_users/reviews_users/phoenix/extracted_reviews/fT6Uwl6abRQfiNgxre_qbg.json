IMO the chicken Marsala is a can't miss item. It's like no other that you've ever had.   This is usually a very busy place. You will sit close to your neighboring table. Suck it up and enjoy. You'll see dishes you'll be envious of, you can meet a local, or you can just sit quietly and stare into your spicy goyza hotpot.   Don't worry about the line. It moves quickly. If you pass this up, you are missing out on a True Phoenix gem.",

Every meal comes with fresh baked dinner rolls, salad with yuzu dressing (yum) and miso soup. Miso soup is almost like Moms. Great variety of menu items with reasonable price. You might not see Japanese chef there but the owner who has been in the business for like over 30 years is personally supervising everyday. Make sure to order strawberry shortcake... It is all so good :-)",

While I liked that there was a variety of seafood - squid, scallop, shrimp - the sauce wasn't very flavorful and a little on the oily side. My friend ordered the orange zest tofu with brown rice. I tried some and it tasted a little too sweet, but the tofu was cooked nicely (wasn't tough like some places make it).  As for the atmosphere of the restaurant, it's small and the noise level isn't too loud so you can easily hold a conversation with whoever you're eating with. But I don't think they have a great ventilation system because you can smell the smoke/cooking smells from the kitchen.",

Very abrupt.   Two things I actually liked. The double shrimp crunchy roll. Standard roll I can get anywhere. This strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake.  Items I've tried and didn't care for: Orange Roughy with Orange Sauce, the fish was delicious, but the pile of rice I can only eat with the some of the orange sauce on it. The side salad that came with it was wilted and boring. Tan Tan-Me, this was okay. I felt like I was eating a spicy spaghetti soup. Not exactly what I was looking for. Korean Spicy Beef Asian Noodles, the beef was okay...no spice to it...the noodles where okay. The meal just looked thrown together and not appealing to the eye.  I don't think I'll be back...maybe for the dessert counter. I saw some other treats I wouldn't mind grabbing to go.",

It's a small glass of some plum wine that'll knock your socks off, with a splash of club soda, and an \"ume\", some sort of small Eastern plum at the bottom. There are tons of sake based beverages, beer mixed with grapefruit juice or calpico (google it, n00bs), and some cool non-alcoholic beverages.  Then, there's the sushi. More than reasonable pricing for the location and decor. I was feeling awfully Arizonan that day, so I ordered the \"baja norte\" just to be brave and try a fun, albeit bastardization of sushi. Spicy yellowtail was actually spicy! Yay! It was just a *little* too salty, however. It was still a steal, and there are still a couple dozen other options if you're pretentious about experimental rolls like yours truly.  Apparently there's a ton of stuff here I need to try, and fortunately I can do just that without breaking the bank! Take a little detour from the light rail area and give Cherry Blossom a chance.",

I was a little disappointed that they only put two slices of salmon in the ramen but there were plenty of veggies to make up for it. It was very filling.  They even give you bread to start out with.

It's very clean, cozy, and charming feel to it with classical music played in the background.  I would say it's a perfect place for a 1st date.  1st time I came here was for the Ramen, which was pretty good.  2nd time, I had the yakisoba noodles, which was pretty good.  Otherwise, you can order the safe, bento boxes.  The menu is kind of long so you get a nice variety.  Interestingly they started serving Pho to which I have not tried.  I'm a little leery about trying the Italian portion since it's a Japanese place but maybe one day.  It's definitely a great lunch spot! I would come back for sure.",

First off, the location is cute, and we were given quick and good service from the start.  We came here for lunch, and I ordered the pad thai noodles while my wife ordered miso soup lunch special which came with a California roll.  Good value for lunch and the pad thai was good, but I wasn't wowed by it.  Miso soup was good, hard to mess that up.  I would have liked to try more, but I was a little put off by the menu.  Well, you can order pad thai, Ramon, and chicken parm?  Hard to specialize in a wide variety of food.  Again, I think food was average, but it wasn't bad.  I just would rather go to a more authentic restaurant for my favorite noodle dishes next time.  Not a bad place by any means so try it out for yourself.",

We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many \"Japanese\" restaurants.  We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.  Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work.",

The menu is vast and oddly includes some Italian entrees (despite owner being from Japan), and we get bread/toast prior to getting our Japanese entrees.  I got the cold beef noodles cooked medium rare, they were soft, not too chewy, and the cold noodles were slightly on the firm side, just how I like them.  The noodles were served on top of some spinach which was kind of odd in a Japanese dish though.  The spicy tuna rolls were just 3/5, ok rice quality, fish was very average, overall not that exciting.  For PHX this is great asian food, I would come back here again if I come back to PHX.  However, it still doesn't compare to NYC or LA ramen places though.",

I generally opt to go for lunch because I can order a roll as well as their tempura bowl at a reasonable cost since it falls during their Happy Hour. I usually end up spending around $17 which for a meal of sushi isn't too bad compared to some chic trendy places that can charge $15 for a roll and then another $15 for an entree. I tend to like to eat a little of everything so whoever goes with me is always more then willing to order a roll for themselves and we share half and half. It definitely fulfills my craving for some sushi! I have always liked the location, it is a bit smaller but I really do enjoy the homey and inviting feel of the set up. I would absolutely recommend this place to a friend and people who I have taken there have enjoyed it themselves and frequent it with me.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I hate to burst people's bubbles, but the competition has caught up to Cherryblossom.  This used to be my go-to spot for ramen and udon in the Valley, and they have other serviceable dishes as well.  But if I'm going to be fair and compare it to the best there is here in the Valley and around the country, then the food here is pretty average.  One thing that's intrigued me is the Italian menu, which I have yet to order from.  But I suspect, given the rising quality of Italian in the Valley, that this would underwhelm me as well.  So I've had the ramen, soba, and udon here.  The hakata ramen and miso ramen here are fine, but the ramen is better at Tampopo and Dozo, and lightyears better at places around the country.  The udon is probably the best Japanese noodle dish they have here - the broth is clean and light with good thick noodles.  The zaru soba was also very average, most likely given that they use commercial soba noodles that are available to all of us.  I may just give a 1/2 star bump for their dessert.  Being Japanese, the desserts here are light and elegant and well-crafted.  Never overly-sweet.  So yes, a 3.5 star review for what really is a Phoenix institution but again, do not come expecting to have your mind blown.  Oh, and parking can suck here when it is busy.",

So I let my fingers do the walking and called them up for a takeout order and they were CLOSED...holiday. Insert sad face here.    So I turned to Yelp for another option and stumbled across Cherry Blossom.  My mind was really saying NO, just get something known and dependable but my tastebuds were saying YASSSSS.    Based on reviews I got the TanTan-Men and just in case I ordered a side of the panfried Gyoza. I ended up eating all of both. The TanTan-Men had heat, not unbearable but just the right amount...my only complaint was while it had heat, it did not have a lot of other flavor.  I added a little hoisin sauce and some salt and perfecto.  It wasn't overly salty to being with. The portion is very big.   This is definitely not as  \"foodie\" of a noodle bowl as the Clever Koi, but it did solve my craving, and they weren't closed for the holiday so I tried something new. If you are searching for a more authentic less foodie bowl of noodles this is your spot. The Gyoza were excellent as well.",

The food and lunch specials are still great and worth the price, but the service has really gone down over the last few times I've gone. So maybe it's more like 3.5 stars?  Like I mentioned, the food here is always good. You start off with a basket of rolls (but FYI!! they'll charge you a few dollars if you ask for more rolls). Way back when, it used to come with banana bread and a cinnamon toast. They have a daily lunch bento box for about $11, and it usually comes with more than enough food for one. I have not gotten any Italian dishes because I've tend to stick to the Asian ones - udon, ramen, rice bowls, etc, but my friend said they are good too.   Now, the service...is just no. Our last server didn't even smile once! She seemed miserable to be there, and we felt forgotten several times during our meal. For example, I had to personally ask for a to-go box and ask for our check because we had been sitting there for awhile now. Unfortunately, this isn't an isolated incident where service was just usually slow. Such a shame really!",

I usually always get Asian noodles and have failed to get Italian noodles, so I have yet to order something off of the Italian menu. Regardless, the food is never bad.       The atmosphere matches the service in my opinion; warm and welcoming. Everyone here is looking forward to greet you with a smile and some delicious food. As for the atmosphere, the decorations match the Italian/Asian theme of the cuisine of choice. The overall feeling of the restraunt is just warm and happy, especially around the holidays.

After a long day, all we wanted was some warm, comfort food that was filling. This did the trick! The spicy tuna to start was very yummy and then I got the vegetable pho- I am no expert but I loved it. Warm, flavorful, and filling. This place is also next to Snoh-- so what's not to love? Cute ambiance as well!",

    "text": "With this cool weather, I had a hankering for a bowl of hot ramen so to Cherryblossom I went.  I decided to take advantage of the Happy Hour and got the Salmon Nigiri which came with 3 pieces and ordered the Hakata Ramen with an extra egg.   The Salmon Nigiri was actually really good, soft and fresh tasting. The rice was a bit on the wet side so didn't keep it's form well under the Salmon. However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.  The Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?  Over all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about. Thus far, their pasta and sushi seems the most promising here.  The service is also pretty good as everything is friendly and quick!",

So, you should try:  Spicy Gyoza Pot Cha-shu Ramen TanTan-Men Ramen Udon Suki  The gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.  I have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!",

Inside is simple and cozy with a casual rustic Japanese theme in the background. The menu here is rather large and offers both Japanese and other Asian specialties as well as a separate section with famous Italian pasta dishes. Interesting!  Started with some appetizers. Potstickers, Vegetable Tempura, and a couple rolls of Sushi. Pretty good so far. Next ordered the main courses. Some of the group went Korean style while others did Japanese.  Ordered some Yakiniku Beef extra spicy, Ten-don Shrimp Tempura with special sauce on Rice, Chicken Katsu, Korean Spicy Beef with Egg Noodles and my favorite the Nabeyaki Udon Seafood Iron Pot which was my selection.  Everything was tasty and we had a lot of fun. Service was friendly and very helpful. Even made the 2007 New Times for Best use of a Noodle.  Gets REALLY BUSY FAST and a little cramped when full.

    "text": "The restaurant features a menu as eclectic as its directionless, yet somehow a bit charming, decor (picture a British phone booth facing a red-brickwalled hallway and Japanese elements mixed in throughout); it's a blend of Italian and Asian pasta dishes, from which I've only ventured through the Asian portion of the menu.    The Asian noodles here can be outstanding and the selection is one of the best in central Phoenix, but there's not much more reason to come here.  My favorite is the beef udon suki, with chewy, thick noodles and lots of beef and flavor. The ramen dishes are passable, although not the best in the Valley (noodles are a little too thin and a bit overcooked, broth is a bit lacking in flavor, although still robust and meaty enough to be pleasant).  Skip the tantan-men, which is billed as a spicy soup and tastes like little more than that:  spice in soup.  As for rice dishes, the katsu is decent, but avoid most of the appetizers:  shrimp shumai were mushy and flavorless, the Korean spicy rib lacked the spice, richness, and tenderness you'd want from a dish with that title, and the gyoza are less than noteworthy.  The lunch special is another great reason to come here:  for under $10, you can get a filling combination, like your choice of noodle soup with inari or a California roll.  Although the sushi isn't a reason to visit Cherryblossom and the California roll isn't something I'd jump at ordering even at my favorite sushi joint, it's a great deal.  And when you're really there for the noodles anyway, how can you beat that?",

    "text": "The food here is fantastic. The service here is terrible. Somehow, every time we go we get the same waiter who sounds just like Napoleon Dynamite and sounds pained every time you ask him something. He's been just generally unpleasant every single time we've gone over the past 4 years, he's never been kind or friendly and has given us smart ass answers a few times when asking about ingredients. Went in the other day and he was REALLY short with us; when the food came I asked him for some soy sauce to which he said \"OKAY.\", then walked off in the wrong direction and never brought it, didn't refill our drinks once, come by at all or bring the check.  Onto the food! It has never disappointed. Their udon dishes are savory and delicious, and the broth is out of this world. Their rolls are fresh and their pasta is also very tasty. There's an odd combination of food here but they make it work so well.   So, I guess the tl;dr is to eat at Cherryblossom at night and not during lunch time.",

What a great combo for 6.95 The miso was light and the noodles were firm the salmon was poached in the broth and full of salmon flavor.   The meal came with bread and a few sweet things not a match but good non the less.  Good food wide variety give it a try.",

We stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded. Waiter did not bring us a bread. i had to ask twice. Order was slow. I saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes. I was ready to go and pick it up.  Sushi quality was bad. Yakisoba noodle was burned.  Well, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?  I will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and   SAYANORA Cherry Blossom",

Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly.   Unfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.  The sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi.",

At first glance its a tiny hole in the wall restaurant but after entering its actually a little bigger than it looked from the outside. seating is still relatively limited and we showed up right at lunchtime so we had to sit in a back corner but I stil diidnt feel cramped. the interior is kept clean and smells like a combination of good food and floral arrangements.  The food itself was really good. I wasnt disappointed with anything we ordered. I had a chasu-pork rice bowl that was delicious.It was a little on the small side as far as portions go but  it came with a small bowl of miso soup that was pretty tasty as far as miso goes. I also ordered a california crunchy roll which was great and for a good price $4 and change. my girlfriend ordered a bowl of tan tan men- bbq pork ramen that was a really generous portion in a larger bowl. The food was also served with some complimentary bread rolls and we had some sweet pink lemonade to wash it all down. All in all the food was great and we ended up paying only $26 which for a pretty good lunch. The service was great once we got to the table we were taken care of the entire time and the waiter was really nice.  I definitely recommend this place ad will be coming back.",

    "text": "My favorite  noodle-arium.  I'm long, long overdue to write something on Cherry Blossom, (and could have sworn I had at some point) perhaps my single favorite restaurant in the area.  In dozens of visits, determinedly working my way up and down the noodles from pan-Asian to Italian, I have never been disappointed with a meal at Cherry Blossom, with the exception of a single mackerel dish which I found not as tasty as other dishes and which also left me hungry - something never done before or since at CBNC.      Last meal was Yakiniku, a \"Korean style thin sliced beef dish with vegetables served on an iron skillet.\"  Moderately spicy hot, delicious, and $11.  It's billed as a rice dish - if only the brown rice had come out before the end of the meal.  Friend Norm ordered an appetizer with his meal - which he reported was really good - if only it had come out before end of the meal - They were apologetic and didn't charge for the late arrival, but still . . . it's the kind of thing that happens frequently enough to keep me from giving that 5th star that the food itself has generally consistently deserved over the several years I've been enthusiastically dining there.  Other great dishes: the thin sliced NY Steak with shitake mushroom sauce - tongue-burning sodium overload but the meat is a thing of beauty. Perhaps next time I'll try it with the sesame mustard sauce instead.  Don't think you like eel? Try theirs' - After a long ago year in China with a lot of rubbery eel and sea cukes that we referred to as \"bicycle handgrips\", I never thought I'd have a taste for eel (and I'm still not too confident about the sea cukes), but this is wonderfully prepared and absolutely delicious. Mark the Ika Yakisoba with calamari and vegetables on your list to try as well as the Korean Spicy beef and all the Asian noodle dishes. My housemate loves the Mixed Tempura dinner, though I find it a tad bland compared to my favorites.  Want something a little lighter but still filling, delicious, and out of the ordinary, try the Unagi salad with grilled freshwater eel and ginger dressing and most definitely the shrimp salad, a generous quantity of mixed greens with mango chutney  dressing on a large plate completely ringed by broiled (or fried?) shrimp with a mayonnaise dressing - It's a salad you'll want to remember to order again.   Skip to the Italian side of the noodle kingdom for a dozen (+1) delicious dishes ranging from the satisfying Marsala Chicken with Spinach Pasta in a rich, but not nauseatingly so, white cream sauce, to the Cajun Shrimp with Smoked Mozzarella, to a simple and also delicious Spaghetti Bolognese.  I can equally vouch for the Little Neck Clam in white wine  or marinara, among many other excellent offerings.    It's a small restaurant, frequently with waiting line for seating on weekend evenings, but the wait has rarely been long - and it's well worth it.  Go when you have time to relax and perhaps be a little patient.  Your drink glass may be dry for a while before anyone notices, or has time to, and the service, always courteous, can otherwise be a little erratic, but the food is so worth it!.  Most entrees range from $9-12 and there's few among the extensive offerings above $14.   Note that weekday lunchtime can be packed and hectic, and though the staff is literally running, it can take a while to get one's check and change.  Vaya con paciencia.",

Then, the front is super unassuming and all the (regular cheapy off-white) blinds are pulled down. If it wasn't for the small 'open' sign, you'd never know. The Japanese chain eatery next door was completely empty, so I thought Cherry Blossom would be the same. Opened the door and BOOM! How inviting! And effing crowded!!  I'm not from Phoenix, and I've been on a mission to find my new go-to Japanese restaurant. Thank you Android GPS for being my white rabbit and leading me here! Authentic and fusion Japanese. Plus Italian pastas. Plus plus house made desserts. Sake, plum wine, curious cocktails. Yes, of course I will eat you and drink you.  My belly ballooned with the Tekkadon (get it with sushi rice!) and chicken katsu. Plum wine with club soda was a great water substitute. I threw in the towel before I could get some cake, but I'll be visiting real soon.   Service was top notch. Prices are stupid reasonable.",

I ended up having to put in some soy sauce to liven it up a little bit. The California roll was right on and I enjoyed it. I also ordered a side if Gyoza (potstickers) and they were very tasty as well. I really like how the wrapping was thinner than most places. The bread that they give you when you sit down is very good.  They are hot and fresh yeasty rolls and it was hard to have just one. They also have a great selection of desserts as well as baked goods. I did bring home a slice of chocolate cake for hubby so I don't know how it is yet but it sure looks good!

First up ordered some gyoza.  Those where a great way to start a meal.  They were so good I would have walked away happy if I ordered another round and just had that for lunch. There are some places are ok under Phoenix that just butcher gyoza/potstickers and I'm usually disappoint.  So it was such a relief to finally have some that were well made.  Onto the mabo sara udon.  I'm kind of tilorn by it.  On one had it was good.  It was a lot spicer then I would have expected.  I only say that because the mabo tofu I have at Chinese places doesn't pack a lot of heat.  That part wasn't the bad.  I think for me there was something missing.  For example it wad like a hot fudge Sunday without the nuts.  It's still good but something was missing.  I would order it again in the future though.  Overall pretty happy with the meal.",

Their happy hour specials are awesome as well. This is a little hole in the wall off of camelback and they have Italian noodles as well, hence the noodle cafe.  Service has been decent and there is a cozy ambiance about the place. They also serve yummy looking desserts.",

    "text": "Top notch eatery for noodles and ramen. I have never tried the sushi here so cannot comment on that. The ramen however is some of the best I have had here in the Phoenix area.  The hakata ramen that I ordered was served very hot, just the way I like it, and so tasty. The broth with the noodles was delicious. The complimentary bread basked was so good, we asked for more and were quickly taken care of. The gyoza were very good, a little different from other places and the sauce served with them was just so-so. One of our party had the tan-men dish which was spicy and they loved it. Told the waitress that if no one was watching he would have licked the plate. Speaking of the waitress, the service was extremely good, even though it was a very busy night. She took time to explain dishes and even remembered my daughter who had been there the previous week. The desserts are outstanding. Tiramasu was so light and flavorful. The strawberry cake was my favorite.  Overall a great dining experience.",

I wasn't sure what kind of restaurant this was since it has different styles of Asian noodles and even Italian pasta (say whuuuuuut?!). The waitress was Japanese and in the middle of service asked us to move because there was a group who speaks Japanese that didn't want to sit next to another table of Japanese speakers. Hmmm... gangsta . I kid you not! I'm like wait.. what makes her think I don't speak Japanese??!! (But Great guess) . The ramen is legit amazing but this time I got the udon noodles to try something different. Definitely very good even though I didn't know what exactly was in it (squid?) lol. Other peeps at my table got Korean beef noodles and beef yakisoba and I tried both, which were excellent. If you get the shrimp dumplings BEWARE of the hot mustard if you're a wimp, which I am not so I loved it but had to go easy after an initial generous dipping and learning the hard way. Had sushi for appetizer and was good not great. (I feel like this review is in reverse chronological order)  Oh yeah don't forget dessert, which tempts you through the glass case. I definitely recommend this place and worth the wait.",

It has an Italian old world style, meets Shanghai, but first let's shake on it Korea while we dine in Japan, feel to it.  The menu is as interesting as the atmosphere. We were warmly welcomed and seated. Upon arrival we received a warm basket of dinner rolls and butter? It wasn't until I opened the menu and found an entire page of Italian dishes (as well as some Korean, Chinese and Japanese entrees) that I understood why. Cool!  The server was very attentive and our food came out in no time. We ordered the Iron Hotpot Beef Udon which was rich in flavor and loaded with beef, also plenty of chewy, thick noodles as well. Very good!  The shrimp tempura was light and crispy and the Baja roll was made with yellow tail and Jalapeno ( my favorite go to roll at any establishment ) fully enjoyed. The sashimi was okay not bad just not the best we've had ... skipping this next time.  We also ordered the spicy beef Korean noodles which was devoured before a photo could be snapped! Safe to say he and I loved this dish!  All in all, a 4 star \" above average casual dining\" review for Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe.",

    "text": "Not bad. When living in the states, especially west Texas, ramen, more specifically real ramen, isn't easy to come by. Come to think of it, ramen in the states isn't easy to come by period. Perhaps it's because ramen has seemingly been lost in translation? For some reason, the dish that's ate in china, Korea, and especially Japan, has been super dumbed down and turned into a quick, cheap, microwaved dish ate by college kids on a budget. This of course causes westerners like me to be baffled at restaurants that ONLY serve ramen. Even when I was in Hawaii, I couldn't understand why someone would take a $0.99 thing and make a restaurant out of it? Anyways... ramen is a thing, and an art. So finding legit ramen is hard to come by.   This place hit the spot. It's decor, staff, even customers, aren't what one would expect from a traditional ramen spot. It reminded me more of a Cracker Barrel than a ramen shop. But the ramen itself is legit. And True to its name, they have all things noodles. They serve Udon, Soba, ramen, even Pad Thai! Noodles for days Mayne!   The menu rounds itself out by offering a variety of other items from sushi rolls to katsudon. Also a variety of drinks. From your normal lemonades to something I had to try just because it was there. Ok, so y'all know what Thai tea is: the \"milk tea\" drink. Unusual sounding but we all know it works. Well have you ever heard of \"Milk Pepsi\"? I haven't. So I ask the very polite and helpful waitress, what exactly this is. She happily explained to me, well it's milk, and Pepsi. Go figure, it was legit. Now I'm never gonna drink Pepsi again without milk. Which won't be often anyways, because I don't drink Pepsi. But again, if I do, it had better have milk in it.   So if you're in Phoenix, for whatever reason, this place is a must go. The price is very fair too.   Das it Mayne.",

Coming from Las Vegas where there's plenty of good Asian food, I think Cherryblossom comes close to being a decent one for AZ standards.   My favorite thing to get here is the chicken curry with rice. I didn't like it the first time, but I gave it a second chance and found it actually really good. The prices here are very affordable, and the customer service has always been good, from my experience. Cherryblossom is located in a small, busy plaza, so parking could be tough. There is street parking though so that's an option.  This place is also a Japanese + Italian fusion, I've never actually tried any of the Italian dishes. If I'm ever craving Japanese food, this is my go-to in Central Phoenix.",

We also had the fried calamari and California roll. Yummmm to both. We stopped by during Happy Hour so we were able to see the Happy Hour menu. Very nice prices and wide variety of food and drinks on the HH menu. Additionally, the service was phenomenal. The waiter was so polite and there was a woman who stopped by from time to time to help as well. The atmosphere was also very cute and cozy.

Its fabulous, the ramen broth is as close as it'll be to satisfy my ramen craving and you know that saying \"If you see local Japanese and Italians eating in the restaurant, you know your in a good spot!\"   My co-worker knows I've been on a hunt for some good ramen in Phoenix. I like the one in Tempe - Tompopo but, the broth isn't too perfection. Anyways, she introduced me to this new findings for lunch and was really happy they have inari (rice cone sushi), I was excited to taste and that was it... I'm amazed to how they prepared it, I haven't found any asian restaurants or markets that make inari the way we eat it back home in Hawaii, on spot!   I had there Hakata ramen which was really good, so good I'm taking pictures and sending it to my husband bragging what I'm eating at this very moment. Lol!  The broth had most of the flavored taste that makes up the warmth of deliciousness and I love that they have the yamasa Shoyu which is the next Shoyu (soy sauce) to Aloha Shoyu. The chasiu is just right not dry but, nice and moist! Too me it is perfection to compare what I've been finding in Arizona. This is as close as we can get to what I am familiar with of back home. And what's the connection of Hawai'i and Japan. Japanese culture is the 3rd largest group in Hawaii over Filipino and whites! So we have alot of real authentic Japanese sushi, ramen, homemade tofu, steaks and so forth..   This is my comfort food that'll make me feel a tad bit closer to home.   On the second visit I brought in my ohana because I wanted to see their reaction. My son had the tan tan spicy ramen, husband had the Cha siu ramen, and as much as I wanted ramen I also wanted to try their pasta, so I had the smoked salmon, fresh spinach and spinach pasta with cream sauce. Well, their reaction was priceless my son's nose started drenching and his throat was coughing and he had a smile like \"dis da one\", they enjoyed the inari as well and was taken with excitement of its taste (eyes wide opened).   The other great bonus is that I have a Hawaiian pidgin accent (broken english), people up here either can't understand what I say, knows I ain't spanish, and I'm not from here. But, if you from Hawaii then you you know the accent and will pick up on it real fast. Which our waitress immediately picked up on me and we all connected! I was sooo happy!!! So she told me next time I come in I gotta try there Shoyu ramen it's almost the exact as zippys saimin! Hell yaaahhh, I will!  The dessert that we shared was this sweet potato pie spice (Okinawan style) it was not heavy, super delicious, and very lite! You can taste the Okinawan potato's... Yummy!!!   And we usually do not get dessert.. .  We found happiness here with our Ramen. Thank u to the wonderful owners for making authentic dishes here in Arizona!  And one more added exciting note: on Friday night there was a long line our wait time was at least 30 min and from what my understanding from other families/ group parties it's like this every Friday night! So you know gotta be ONO right! Go check um out!",

I love going there and having a nice meal with my wife, enjoying some great sushi / sake, and their salmon plate is insanely good! Having sampled almost their entire menu, I will say that like any restaurant, some things on their menu are better than others, but I have not ever had anything that was not tasty, and my wife and I have never been ill from the sushi. I know this sounds like a weird review, but considering it's a sushi place, that is a valid statement that should carry some weight, considering we have eaten 100's of their sushi rolls over the years. I will not mention the details of the 1 or 2 times we had bad service ONLY because we have been there literally 100's of times, and I think both times the service was not great, they were severely understaffed. We still like to go there, and they have always been happy to see us!",

I came in for lunch after discussing a friends recent trip to Tokyo I was just dying for some Ramen. The restaurant was surprisingly slow for noon on a Friday but it quickly filled up by the end of my visit. I ordered the Cha-shu ramen with a boiled egg. The pork was good but not great, and was missing that rich fatty texture that I love so much. The noodles were fine, nothing to write home about. And the boiled egg was just a plain hard boiled egg. I was expecting the Ajitsuke Tamago but that may have just been my mistake. Either way it didn't add anything to the dish. I must say though the broth was killer. I know Ramen is highly dependent on the broth but I feel like it shouldn't be the only great part of the meal. Service was good, you definitely don't come here for a show but they do the job efficiently and with a smile.",

The restaurant itself is smaller but very clean. It does not come off as the traditional asian restaurant. The menu is a mix of Japanese and Italian. We tried the shoyu and takana ramen. Both were extremely delicious. The shoyu was a bit salty but not unexpected. We also tried a seaweed salad and tootsie roll. The seaweed salad was very good but had a garnish on it that did not blend well with the other flavors- it was very harsh and bitter. My boyfriend thought it could have been something in the radish family. The tootsie roll was also very good. The flavors were light and refreshing and blended well together. The eel sauce was drizzled nicely and not overused. The service was very fast and our waiter was great! We will definitely be coming back here.",

Being a Saturday night, there were a lot of people, but we only waited about 25 minutes for a table.  Our waitress was very personable and we had a wonderful experience.  She was certainly quick and efficient, but did not sacrifice personalized service to be so.    The food was also very good.  We started with the fried calamari, which I thought could have used a little more flavor, but the wasabi mayo was a nice addition.  Our Tootsie Roll was also tasty.  The main courses were the highlight by far.  I got the seafood Iron pot (fabulous if you are a seafood lover like me!) and my boyfriend ordered one of the italian dishes which he also raved about.

My friend got the vongole with white wine sauce and she loved it, while I got unajyu which is fresh water eel with unagi sauce over rice. Unagi and rice is up there as one of my favorite foods and they did it really well by giving the eel a great char.

It's small and a little cramped but I definitely recommend trying to get a seat at the bar if you can! You get to watch the chefs cook and also see what's coming out of the kitchen to help make your mind up on what to order.  The Japanese side of the menu is very good. I've never tried the Italian side. I've had a variety of items from it and I've never been dissatisfied.  The one downside to this place is service. It can feel a little slow to get your food and I'm not sure what training the wait staff receive prior to starting. One night I ordered zaru soba with tempura but all that came were the noodles. When I asked about my tempura the waiter tried to insist that the sauce was tempura, which... who doesn't know what tempura is?! In the end I never got my tempura because of some more trouble with this waiter but I chalk it up to him learning the ropes (it was his first time on the job) since I've never had issues before.   The owner personally came to our table to apologize and offered me a free dessert. I didn't want anything but she still gave me a slice of banana bread, which was extremely kind of her (and it was very good, too).",

Plus the oddest dinning room I have ever been in. We were on the odd half room side and I felt like I was in a coat closest.   The Spicy Korean beef I had was a little spicy but that is about all I can say about it. It left you mouth going ehh.   My taste buds were craving a buttered roll based on other reviews becauae who does not love yeast covered in salty butter? Well I did taste some semblance of a yeast roll but it was closer to the kinda that somone always brings to Thanksgiving and they sit untouched. With a side of butter.   I would skip the fusion and go for a real live Asian or Italian restaurant and skip this hybrid that should have been whacked by the family.",

Really greasy, and the miso didn't do anything to mitigate the amount of grease we had in ours. The green pepper was way over cooked and turned to rubber.  I had the goyza as my date was a vegetarian. This is where they went from one start to two stars. These were damn good, but not enough to salvage the meal.  The Service: We ordered takeout on a Saturday night. Maybe this was a mistake on our part. When they took our order, they told us \"15 minutes.\" After 45 minutes we had our food in our hands after standing around like a couple of assholes with our thumbs up our butts for 30 additional minutes. I hate waiting because you cannot manage your product flow out of the kitchen. If its going to be 45 minutes, tell me that and I will gladly show up on time. However, having me stand around like that isn't going to work for me.  All and all, I know this place is the light burning bright for many of you, but like I said, I just don't see this place's potential. I'll stick to Rice Paper down on 7th St.",

It can be pretty loud at times, if full, but that's ok, I've been in much worse.  It's very Japanese with a twist for those who are unfamiliar with Japanese foods, you can always order an Italian dish instead.  Sushi is good, and reasonable in price as well.  The cooks are insight and friendly with those sitting at the bar.  You know it's pretty authentic when you see more Japanese/Asian sitting and eating their bowl of soup, many choices to choose from too!",

I know, I know.. this is Phoenix, so how good of a bowl of ramen can I really expect here?  We have some pretty good restaurants, but definitely not the best Asian food.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to how good the broth was.  I got the Cha-Shu ramen and the broth was not too salty annd to me, had great flavor.  The noodle texture was alright- nothing too spectacular.  But since the broth was really good, I would give it a 4/5.",

    "text": "Whenever I crave Japanese style food that isn't sushi, this restaurant has satiated me each and every time.  From their katsu curry or tempura to their soba, ramen, udon, I have enjoyed each meal and what they've had to offer.  I will suggest though that if you do order the katsu curry, that you ask for the katsu to be served on the side so it doesn't lose the crispy quality of the panko that is otherwise buried in the curry sauce.    I don't know anyone who has tried their Italian fare, but my friends and I have found their Asian food selections to be delicious.  Their prices are pretty reasonable and I find their portions to be decent as well.  I have yet to personally try their sushi, but I have heard that it's also quite good.    I haven't had any issues with the service, but I also wouldn't say that they go above and beyond either - it is adequate.  The atmosphere is a little odd since it was, from what I heard, converted from a bakery to a restaurant, but it is clean and comfortable.  I do think it would be nice if they honed in on the Asian cuisine though, being named Cherry Blossom Cafe otherwise seems slightly misleading. (But now I'm just being nit-picky.)  Overall, I have had rather positive experiences at this establishment and look forward to my next visit!",

Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?!   Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow.   Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!",

Of note is that the friends who look me were actually Japanese - always  good sign when choosing Asian restaurants. My absolute favorite dish is the hot udon soup with either chicken or veggies but I have tried several other dishes and have enjoyed them. One of the cool things in this restaurant is the curious mixture of Asian and Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, the one time my boyfriend tried out an Italian dish the noodles tasted a bit stale.

It was during the summer and my host mother would always make cold noodles with dipping sauce, a very popular dish during the humid summer months. I nearly fell out of my chair when I first tried the Zaru Soba at Cherry Blossom, I was instantly transported back to my incredible time in Japan.  Cold buckwheat noodles, a light soy-based dipping sauce and a little fried panko fish on the side, the perfect dish for when it's hot as sin outside. A little banana bread to start doesn't hurt either! Say what you will about the service, I often only go at lunchtime when there aren't that many people but I have found the service to be unintrusive and very polite.  Now if only I could find a place in Phoenix that serves Japanese pancakes....",

I like how it's divided and the brick facing giving more privacy to catch those \"stolen moments\" of my away time that I am so fond of.  The food is surprisingly good yet cheap and with great variety. Many Western dishes are available as well as sushi, udon, and cold summer noodles. They should drop the \"Noodles\" part from their name as their are only about 4 noodle dishes on the menu.  The place puts out a bread basket of fresh baked breads and banana bread before your food arrives.  Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Sapporo on tap is available for beer drinkers as well as the usual cheap wines.  Great for lunch and nice for during the week dinners.  Owned and operated by actual Japanese people, a rarity in Phoenix. I can't believe I have been going there so much recently I guess it's become my favorite joint, that is not part of some large-corporate-ho-hum-loud-place.",

I would say this place may fit you if you are fine to wait for an hour for a plate of noodle and don't expect good services.  We waited for about 20 min for two small appetizers, and another 40 min for 2 plates of noodles and 1 ramen. We asked one of the waiters to check if our orders were forgotten after waiting for an hour, and what he told us (with a rude attitude) is that they have two big groups and those people have been waited for 2 hrs so we either have to keep waiting or just pay for the appetizers and go away. (After waiting for 1 hr, this is what we got?! They should have let us know that there will be such long wait when we stepped in!)  We decided to keep waiting since my friend was worried that other restaurants are closed by the time we get there (It was almost 9pm.). Turned out that was a big mistake. One of the clam noodle plates was not well-cooked. (The angel hair noodle was still half raw.) The other one was even worse. Some clams were still icy. Not just cold, they were icy! Eventually two plates had to be sent back. I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

The service was nice and helpful and the place is a little divey to me but could be described as quaint by some. I see some other recommendations but I doubt I go back with so many higher caliber dining places with all around great food so close by. The pricing was right around the price I would spend for much better even then. To each his own I suppose but I know two people that weren't pleasantly surprised.",

There are a half dozen selection of soups and you're sure to find something tasty.  I'll come back for noodle soup, it's flavorful and BIG.  The lunch special also comes with a mixed green salad, about the size of a normal salad course, and a tasty ginger dressing.  I finished my salad before the sushi and noodle soup arrived and simply could not finish my meal.  A quick word about the sushi here, have reasonable expectations.  It's not their forte and it's far below the quality of the rest of the meal. I'd give CBNC three and half stars but I think dining is about more than just the food.  The decor here is a mish-mash of western, asian, coffee house garb.  It really doesn't work and kept me a bit uncomfortable, in large part due to the abundance of nick-nacks on the table (little lamp [non-working], metal cactus sculpture and the assorted condiments).  It's a good thing the service is friendly and helpful because the menu is extensive.  Our waitress steered us toward Udan noodles (Soba noodles are a bit more substantial and made of wheat?) and we were happy about our choices. If CBNC would tighten its menu and choose one decor I'd probably be raving about it.  For now, it's just OK but I'll be back for another noodle lunch.",

Poking fun at the decor aside, CherryBlossom without a doubt knows it's Japanese cuisine. I forgot what types of sushi rolls I ordered but they certainly hit the spot as did the bowl of udon.

Narrow, brick walls, many small tables lined up and friendly people walking around busily working hard to make us all happy. The menu was definately impressive to see so much variety. The portions are huge for main courses and I like how the appetizers are small so you do not feel that you are eating two meals. It's just a snack (which is what an appetizer is) The only unfortunate thing was the lady forgot to bring my hot green tea...oh well. I am asian and have plenty of tea at home if I truly need it. This place is great and I did enjoy the food and ambiance...only, I have other asian places that are more my favorites which is why in comparison this place gets three stars.",

Their Tonkotsu ramen (Hakata ramen on the menu) is best I've found in PHX. Their other menu items are also pretty tasty. Their prices are also pretty reasonable.   The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the service. It's rather sub-par. The wait staff are friendly they just aren't overly attentive and often seemed a bit confused or disjointed. I often find myself waiting for sometime after I sit down for a waiter to even come by with water. It's not the worst thing ever, and it's certainly worth it for the food, it's just the only thing keeping them from a 5 star review.",

We started with the Caterpillar and Rainbow rolls (both just $5 during happy hour), both typical rolls, which they did very well. For our main course we split two entrees, the Beef Curry Udon and the Nagasaki dish, which consisted of a variety of seafood and veggies, and the crispy noodles, yum!! All the food was absolutely delicious, and at a fair price, especially during happy hour! What we found really entertaining is the surprising Italian menu they have, random, but it looked equally appetizing. We were sitting right next to the dessert display too, and though we didn't try anything, like their tiramisu, our mouths were watering.  The atmosphere is great; it has a French cafe fell, but with Italian influence, and then all of a sudden: great sushi and noodles! It's a lot of great cuisine under one roof. I'll definitely be returning.",

I've been to places where you can taste the week old chicken and day(s) old oil it was fried in, but not here, it was fresh chicken breast. We also tried the crunchy shrimp roll, it was also good.  The menu was a little odd, it featured sushi and traditional Japanese soups and platters, but it also had a page with Italian food...? Japanese and Italian are two of my favorite foods, but I'd rather they'd be at separate establishments! Lol  Overall our first experience was a good one, our waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful. No complaints here, we will be back soon!",

I've lived in Japan for a while and my wife is also Japanese, so when I and my wife say it's like being back in Japan, believe us. You can tell it's also authentic as the people running the restaurant are actually Japanese (most Japanese restaurants in the valley are some kind of American/Japanese fusion which isn't authentic at all). Anyway, the only downside is that it's in Phoenix which can be a drive depending on where you live. Great food, great prices! !",

In a frenzy of missing LA food (DAIKOKUYA!!), I searched Yelp last night (honestly, more in time-killing mode) to find a place in Phoenix that sells authentic ramen (I am like Naruto with my ramen, fools).  Imagine my shock when I saw this place had ramen...not just ramen, but TONKOTSU ramen.  Then, and this is the killer, it was across the street from where I'm staying!  \"At last,\" I thought, \"God has forgiven me for that unfortunate incident in junior high on that co-ed camping trip.\"  Been making \"good deed\" installment payments on that incident for awhile.  Alas, he still has a bone to pick:  3 stars because the food wasn't just \"it's not Daikokuya,\" but just not good.  Noodles were freshly un-bricked, 3 pieces of Oscar Meyer lunchmeat (or one slice cut up), and...actually, that's it.  No veggies, no seaweed, no egg, nothing else.  If you like ramen (and, more importantly, have had good ramen), probably not the place to rush to.  Shrimp dumplings were OK, though. Service was sketch:  took a crapload of time to flag my waitress to close out.  Place gets high marks from others, though, so I'll have to try something else some other time.  Maybe.  The heart takes awhile to heal.",

Haven't had a bad meal here...try to go here at least a couple times a month!!! Okay, had 1 bad dish; they didn't have Orange Roughy; so they subsituted Oreo Dory Fish; 2 bites, I sent it back; and got the salmon.  Which was flawless as usual. They do small touches; when asked; like ground daikon.  Something my mother & father do; when I go home to visit. Also, wish they would have Tsukemono; but maybe I have to bring my own from home... Gohan(Rice) is always perfect; so that's probably why I like this place and Tokyo Express next door.",

I have been coming here for years now, I have recommended this place to people and they have taken their friends. I have been served by the owner, who is phenomenal. She knows how to make customers feel special! Unfortunately the staff doesn't have the same exceptional customer service as she does. The service is usually mediocre at best. I have overlooked this because the food is good and on occasion the owner would serve us and give us a great experience.  But I won't return as my last visit was wrought with terrible serve and poor quality food. The server we had was exceptionally bad, it seemed likey from lack of experience and/or training. She miscounted the amount of waters we needed then didn't come back, we had to go find someone and request the missing water. They didn't give us silverware and when we asked the busser for some she said, \"Ask your waitress\". The appetizers arrived as we were finishing our meal.  Then after eating part of a roll I found mold on the bread. No one in my party ate their bread rolls after that, understandably. The manager was informed of the situation and didn't even come to the table, I had to ask the server to tell him to come over.  His response to me was \"It's just a little bit of mold. And anyways the bread is free.\" I was appalled. He offered to replace the one moldy roll with a fresh one and that was it. Over and over he repeated \"it was only a little bit of mold\". This made me question all the other food, if a little bit of mold was acceptable for a customer to eat then what else was acceptable? My group and I began to have doubts about the food we were eating and left most of the food untouched. I really did enjoy their food in the past, but if moldy bread is fine with management then this is not a place I want to eat.",

Both parking and seating are tight. And this is obviously a popular spot.   We were seated quickly, but no waiter visited for just over ten minutes. I signaled to the hostess lady and she nodded, saying she would send him over. Finally had our orders in about 15 minutes after being seated-- Champon for me and Udon Sucki for her along with two rolls of sushi and gyoza.  Initial drinks landed soon after ordering and food followed some minutes behind. That's all we saw of our waiter again for a long while. The lack of service really put a damper of the experience since we came in excited to eat here.  The food was only okay by our tastes. The broth was okay, if bland and diluted. The noodles were par for the course. They were very generous on the seafood in the Champon, which was nice. The sushi was good, whereas the gyoza was very light on meat.   We probably expected too much after seeing so many crowds. Would try them again... maybe something from the Korean side of the menu?",

However, my friends were RAVING about it and wanted to come here for dinner last night and I'm always up for trying new places. =)  I actually really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. It has a cozy, mom and pop shop feel to it. As far as the menu, there are so many things to choose from! They have such a variety of things on the menu that it was so hard to know what to get. Plus I was starving so I wanted to try EVERYTHING! You can have some italian pasta, ramen noodles, sushi, cold noodles, hot noodles, Thai noodles or a rice dish. It was such a huge selection to choose from.   I'm glad I came with my friends because I was so indecisive on what to order. I ended up getting the Chicken Pad Thai with a milk green tea to wash it down. I've never really enjoyed a green tea but when I saw it on the menu it was something different so I wanted to try it. It was actually quite tasty. They also have a variety of wines and cocktails to choose from. The Chicken Pad Thai itself was ok. I thought it was a bit salty and wasn't anything spectacular.   All in all, I don't think it's a restaurant that I would drive across town to. If I was in the area then it would most likely be an option to choose from, mainly because I also want to try their sushi and ramen noodles. But they are well known for their noodles so I'd like to come back to try that next time. =)",

I was seated quickly and had my order in front of me in less than 20 mins. Which was shocking due to the crowd. I ordered the curry chicken Katsu. It was DELICIOUS. Perfect curry flavor. My waiter was attentive but he did seem a bit annoyed by his manager or maybe it was just typical kitchen drama. Since I was sitting at the bar, the cooks and I had a great laugh about it. I will be back and hope to try one of tempting desserts.",

    "text": "If you're craving for noodles, stop by Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe! The usual starter for me is the all in one tempura that includes fried vegetables, fish, calamari, and shrimp. For the entree, go for a noodle dish. My preference is the cha shu which is the hakata ramen but with more bba pork! The broth is a milky white broth that will warm your soul. Green onions and strips of mushroom as garnish. Lastly, the noodles are the perfect consistency. You'll want to eat your noodle dish as soon as possible to avoid getting the noodles mushy. If you do not prefer ramen, there are other dishes featuring udon and soba noodles along with a variety of non-noodle dishes.",

I always get a tan tan men when I come here but I've also tried several of their sushi rolls, yakiniku, cha shu and some other dishes that I can't remember off the top of my head.

    "text": "I'm so confused by the amazing reviews. Maybe I just came on a really off day, but Cherryblossom Cafe was both extremely underwhelming in terms of food and service.   The interior has a dimly-lit, cozy ambiance, but it was really, really hot inside (and I usually dislike air conditioning). That coupled with the small space and coziness of the tables made for a very uncomfortable lunch. Our waitress was probably exhausted from the heat and lunchtime rush as well, and she seemed short and irritable as she took our order. She checked on us all of one time in the long 45-minute wait before the food came, and we had to try repeatedly to flag down a server for water refills. Asking for the check took similarly long, to the point where we walked up to the counter to pay.   Japchae: This was probably the worst rendition of this Korean noodle dish I've ever had. It was a smaller appetizer potion, hence the lower price point. The noodles were thinner than usual, severely undercooked, and salty to the point of being inedible. The beef slices were thin and over-marinated so they were even saltier than the other components of the dish. I tried a few mouthful because I was so hungry by the time this came, but each mouthful of crunchy noodles was less palatable than the last.  Yakisoba: Similarly to the japchae, this dish was deathly salty. To add insult to injury, the vegetables and some of the meat were burnt. I think they were probably at be bottom of the wok during stir-frying and left there for too long. I'm a fan of the toasty flavor of wok break, but not when the ingredients are bitter. I thought the noodles were a touch underdone, but it wasn't as bad as the japchae. As far as stir-fried. noodles go, I wouldn't order this again.  Champon: This dish wasn't bad, as the soup wasn't too salty and there was a good portion of seafood. I liked the baby octopus, squid, and shrimp. The noodles were chewy and elastic, and the portion was pretty large.  Cha-shu ramen: This was probably the best dish of the meal, as the broth was creamy and flavorful. I wouldn't say it was authentic because I didn't get that pork broth flavor I usually look for in my ramen, but the flavor was pleasant. The noodles were undercooked so the center was slightly crunchy, but I let them soak in the hot broth for about ten minutes and they were fine. The pork had been cooked and refrigerated, but it's rare to find a restaurant that doesn't do this since cha-shu takes a while to cook.  I probably won't be back, although I didn't try the sushi and that's what other tables around me seemed to order instead of noodle dishes. Based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for its namesake: noodles.",

For appetizers we always gyoza they are some pan fried pork vegetable pot stickers with a special sauce and they are to die for .  Can forget their complementary freshly baked bread it's so soft and delicious. It's a small cozy place with great atmosphere and service.",

Before all the hype and the city found out about you. You won't hurt for business but you lost some customers tonight.   If you've never been you must go. The shear variety they offer and certain dishes which are delicious are worth a try. That being said the quality of their food has suffered some. The Tokyo Express they own next store has bled over just enough that someone whose been going there since the early 2000's can tell. The service tonight was horrible and the young lady at the front who rolled her eyes at a simple request to change tables (slow night lots of room) sealed the deal. I'm not going to drop a couple of bills to be treated like that. Not when the city now offers many more options.  I'm actually kind of sad. This used to be \"Our\" place.",

She told me she would send a server but I was so annoyed by then I walked out as she started to laugh and say bye have a good day. Cherry blossom has went down over the years unfortunately because I use to love the place, not sure who management is but they should probably consider hiring more employees!!",

The right amount of spice as well!  The Beef Boodle Stir Fry was actually more spicier than I expected. It was still tasty, definitely not for someone who doesn't like spicy.   My favorite was actually the Rainbow roll. Not a bad deal for only $6.50  If I'm ever on this side of town, I would come back for half hour and get sushi.

The last couple of times they did not get my order correctly.  I think it's a nice touch if the waiters can remember your order without writing it down, but they might want to start writing it down here.  I ordered the ramen without sprouts and a drink, and the ramen came with sprouts and my drink never came.  The time before that they brought out the wrong sushi appetizer, so it's starting to be a pattern.  Not good.  I can usually set that aside because I enjoy the ramen so much, but it doesn't have the same kick to it that it used to.  Maybe I had an off day batch but it wasn't something that I'd be willing to overlook the other issues for.  I was waiting for a while for my check so I finally went up to the counter instead of waiting any longer.  Overall it felt disappointing.",

I had the Udon Noodle Combo (Bowl of Udon soup and California Roll). The Udon was with \"Mixed Mountain Vegetables\" (which had an extremely similar flavor to chives and spinach). The food was good; not extraordinary, but good.   I considered giving CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe three stars, but when it came down to it, the service was good and helpful, my order was done quickly, and the price is right.

Like, how interesting to have the choice between pasta or Asian food, I wouldn't have thought to make the connection, so props to the owners. Normally, I would say that a place like this is \"culturally-confused\", but they do a good job at it so I can't complain. There was European and Asian decor all over the place, hah, loved the tele booth! It was so cozy and clean, the store fronts to places like these always throw me off, I never know what to expect inside.  I had a very large lunch today, my combo came with salad, soba/udon soup, and a Californian roll. I choose the Kitsune Udon, I never had tofu seasoned like that before, it was almost like eating dessert, in a big bowl of noodles, so very sweet. I'm not the one to purposefully eat Californian rolls but there's was great and so nicely presented. And to drink, (smirk) I had the Japanese Mojito, which had sake instead of rum (I figured why the heck not, I tried a mojito made with whiskey the week prior!). Shockingly delicious, def could taste the sake but in a good way, also there iced green tea was refreshing.  Now, with a full belly and happy heart, this afternoon's studying will be a bit more bearable. Thank you for an afternoon affair to remember Cherryblossom!",

    "text": "This place is pretty amazing!  Not because of the food or decor, but rather the hostess, who is smarter than the average bear. To be clear, the hostess I am referring to is the short Mexican lady that can't keep up with her duties as a hostess (but obviously is oblivious to the fact). When it started getting busy, I saw her neglect multiple people upfront who were waiting to put their names on a wait list since she thought it was better to let the area get so crowded waiters couldn't get through. She eventually started a list but didn't put for names of the people who she said she would remember that were already waiting. As you would suspect, Ms. Einstein started seating people from the list ahead of those that were waiting. I witnessed this and saw people getting pretty upset with her and the lack of organization. The front desk area was chaos...it was hilarious!  At one point there was a waiter standing in the middle of a crowd people upfront looking helpless.  Anyways, just wanted to give a standing ovation to the hostess with the mostess...you deserve a gold star!!!  Wait who are those customers leaving...\"Cherry Lost-em\" as in customers forever!  Ha!  Couldn't resist!",

    "text": "The good: Nice ambiance, friendly service. I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign.   The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket!   If you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible).   The sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it?   The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!  What about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix.   Are we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.  So why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV",

The menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.  Everyone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.  One thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill.",

Came in early and took advantage of happy hour for draft beer and appetizers ...gyoza and a caterpillar roll. Had their ramen which was pretty good. I spiced it up with some hot sauce and really increased the intensity. Phoenix suffers from a lack of good Asian good in general, but ramen specifically. F you want a good priced dinner and solid tasting food, cherry blossom is a great option in the heart of Phoenix.",

Last time my friends and I ate here it took a while to be seated, get our food and one entree came out later than the others. It was the dinner rush so kind of to be expected. We didn't feel comfortable eating without the last person's entree. So we waited and our server noticed without us saying anything. Our server stepped up and refreshed the rest of our meals (ramen) so that everyone had hot meals at the same time. Then he removed the late entree from the bill for the inconvenience and gave us TWO amazing desserts on the house as a way of apologizing for any inconvenience. We never made a stink, but this was certainly appreciated and more than made up for any long wait or inconvenience. This is not something I'd expect on every visit, but it does go to show that the staff is doing what they can to ensure an enjoyable visit. As for the food, everything has been wonderful and delicious. Curious to try their Italian selections next time!",

The waitress apologized, promising to bring a replacement. The replacement didn't come till after we were halfway into our bento boxes. The boxes included sushi, but no wasabi or Ginger! The sushi rolls, salad, orange slices and the tempura were yummy, but the steak was too tough to eat. After the waitress brought our check, she didn't return to pick up the credit card so I carried it over to the cashier. Well, maybe they were short staffed so I'll cut the server some slack, but the substandard soup and steak and the sushi served sans ginger are just disappointing.",

If I'm extra hungry, I'll add an order of yellowtail sashimi too, then finish off with green tea ice cream.    This is a comforting cafe that has high quality, familiar Japanese cuisine with a little Italian fusion twist on some of their food.  The prices aren't super low, but I don't mind paying the premium.    I always try to get here before the meal rushes.  So I get in here for dinner at 6pm or earlier.

I am a regular here, and come in about 3-4 times a week. The food isn't the greatest, however for the price, it is totally, totally worth it. They have bento boxes for lunch that will cost you less than $12, and it has a ton of food in it. It usually comes with a roll, salad, miso soup and depending on the bento box for the day, NY steak and/or teriyaki chicken.   Their ramen is perhaps my favorite in Arizona, as they keep it pretty simple and traditional. I always get the hakata ramen (only $6.85) , or chashu ramen if I want more pork. Sushi isn't the freshest, but again, it's pretty cheap.  I love their cripsy calamari. The wasabi mayo sauce it comes with is so delicious. My boyfriend loves the spicy gyoza hotpot. I am not a huge fan of their soft shell crab - I felt like they put too much cajun spice in it. I've had the sukiyaki before which was pretty good, and the korean spicy beef is one of my faves.   Service is always good. This place is always so busy and so are the servers so service can be slow sometimes, but everyone here is a sweetheart.",

    "text": "We've been here a couple of times, and left happy each time.   We got the pot stickers to start out with. They were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce (which is a vinegar based sauce). I usually like my pot stickers a little crispier, and these were just crispy on one side, but they were still good.  The first time we went, my boyfriend thought he was ordering the pork katsu curry, but actually ordered the plain pork katsu. Although disappointed, he still enjoyed it. He didn't realize they were two different things and made note of it. Next time, he ordered the pork katsu curry and really liked it.  I ordered the Korean spicy beef the first time I came. It was delicious! I had more than enough for leftovers, and when I brought it into work the next day my coworkers were jealous. The second time I got the yakisoba, which was good, but I don't think I would order it again, since it's a pretty simple dish and something that I could easily make at home.  Unfortunately, I no longer live in the central Phoenix area so we probably  won't be visiting very often, but hopefully we can make it back here again sometime.",

The vibe of the place is very Asian, but the decor is totally like an Italian eatery, which I really enjoyed.  Regarding the food, we've good twice.  The first time I ordered the udon, which was awesome!  I've had a hard time finding good thick udon in AZ,...which I guess is understandable, but nevertheless still frustrating.  At any rate the udon here was very good and the meat was very tender and lean.  My only complaint is not much comes in the soup, so you have to add it on which cost extra.  Then the second time I had the chicken parm.  The sauce was very good and had great flavor.  It wasn't too sour like some red sauces and the chicken was moist and seasoned well.  However, I don't think I'd order it again simply because of the breading.  The texture of the breading was a little off for me and the crumbs were a little too fine.  However, for complete disclosure, I'm not Italian and I didn't grow up eating the food so maybe the texture was spot on; at least the rest of the meal was.   All-in-all I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes.",

When the waiter took our order for alcohol, sake bombs, he said whatever was on there [on the menu] was what we were gonna get, as if he didn't know what beer/alcohol was on the menu (we just specified which beer we'd like to have with our sake because there were different ones listed). There was a lady that came over to our table and actually communicated with us about our entrees but she wasn't our waiter.

We love everything from their Italian pasta (chicken Parmesan or Pescatore), ramen, katsu, summer rolls (gotta try this), spicy Korean beef noodles, and more.

They had a lot of different asian fare from korean spicy soup to Japanese ramen/ udon, gyoza and italian. When I made a special order with the udon the waitress didn't know that it was a common japanese dish to get katsu udon.   My husband's ramen was tiny! No wonder it was only 7.95 but had no normal ramen finishes like soft boiled egg, seaweed or  radish and broth was very bland. The food here was dissapointing and the waitresses kept making unnecessary comments that made us feel unwelcome. We probably wont come again especially since it's in downtown. Good thing is Snoh shavery has boba and desserts next door!",

We have taken Chinese, Japanese, and Korean international students here, all have been happy with the variety, authenticity, and taste of the food.     As for me... I am the penny pincher in the group, and over the years I have noticed changes in the restaurant, and the food provided... When we first started going there, they used to have after dinner mints.  There was a delicious variety of bread in a basket brought to the table, always enough food on the platter for a left over meal, and the price was reasonable.   The after dinner mints were stopped a few years ago. Recently, when we went to celebrate my son's birthday, we were told there would be a charge to eat his cake at the restaurant, so we ate it at home, in the past we have left pieces for the staff who wanted some.  The bread was simply rolls, and when we asked for a refill were told it would be a dollar \"a roll\", (forget that).  Everybody finished the meal on their plate, no left overs (wah) .  And worst of all, the receipt was in two pieces, that I was told had been added by hand .... My husband did not want to create an incident on my son's birthday, and would not allow me to question the addition, which did not appear correct to me...  They may have added the tip in to the total, but because I did not question it... we tipped from the total...  6 people, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, 2 sodas, 6 entrees.   $110.",

Its known for the noodles and I'd recommend the ramen (nothing like the packaged stuff you get for 20 cents, and you'd stock up and eat three times a day as a starving student).  I also love the udon noodles.   If you're more of a rice person, the unagi (freshwater eel) rice box is my husband's favorite.  But a recent price jump in the price (it used to be 11, and now is 17) is making him change his mind about what to order.  The sushi is decent, but this is not a sushi house, so keep that in mind.  The complimentary bread is awesome (although they don't give banana bread anymore, and that really was my favorite).  Lastly, as others have said the service isn't the best.  It's a bit slow, and they're always very crowded.  But take your time and enjoy the company you're with and you'll be fine!",

We had our to go order and our left overs and we are on the way out and our waitress checks our bag and says \"hold on part of it is missing\" WOW!  I gotta say that hasn't ever happened to me in any restaurant!  I would have been home and then realized I was missing something and then had to go back!  Also for all my veggie friends...this place has some amazing options for us.  I gotta say I haven't enjoyed a meal as much as this place in a VERY long time and their excellent customer service is the icing on the cake.  The best part however is hearing tourists say \"HEY THAT WAS CONNIE CHUNG\" I corrected them and said \"Do you mean Lin Sue Cooney?\" it was good for a laugh but you just never know who you will see here!  it is AMAZING!  GO!!!!",

The service is okay--not the friendliest staff, but polite and efficient.  Still, if you're in the area for lunch, this little hideaway is like getting out of the city for an hour or so.

    "text": "This place is phenomenal and yes I wholeheartedly agree with other reviews that the best seats are at the bar...they are prime real estate as you get to see the beautiful dishes that come out of the kitchen. Get there early as we did (5 p.m) or risk waiting a long while. By 6 p.m, there was a line out the door!  The variety on the menu is downright staggering. There is everything from salads, sushi, noodle, rice, even Italian dishes.  My friend Michelle and I shared a total of three dishes and it was plenty of food. We ordered a ramen noodle dish with barbecue pork, a chicken katsu curry over rice, and a spicy Korean noodle dish. We had no room for dessert after these dishes!  I cannot fault this restaurant for anything. The flavors, colors and prices were outstanding. Despite the bustling kitchen and the somewhat hurried staff, everyone was so incredibly pleasant. and service was warm and efficient. Considering all the orders that the kitchen staff were mingling with, our food came out in literally no time at all.  Cherry Blossom noodle cafe is more what I call an Asian fusion restaurant. It is a little dive that looks like nothing from the outside. You just have to be courageous enough to open the front door and discover the fabulous flavors of Asia that await to conquer your palate. I definitely would not say that Cherry Blossom  is Japanese by denomination. By far, it is my favorite Asian restaurant in the valley due to its incredible variety and flavors.",

I called to order the Cha-Shu for take out. The lady said it would be 15-20 minutes, so I got there about 25 minutes later. I still ended up waiting for another 10 minutes. Waiting wouldn't have been so terrible if there was actually a place to wait. The entry area has two chairs, and a hutch in the way. So not only is there nowhere to sit, there is really nowhere to stand. It didn't help that there were 3 other parties waiting to be sat, along with a steady stream of people coming in to add their name on the wait. I ended up being awkwardly in the way of everyone the whole time, even though I tried to stay out of the way.  I finally got my ramen and headed home. I was willing to forgive all if the ramen was good but it was pretty bland. I ended up adding a bunch of Sriracha to it so that it would have some flavor.  The rest of the menu sounds good, and I would be willing to give a second chance, but i certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon.",

I've sampled a good deal of the menu, and most of it is quite good. Most recently, we were a party of six for a luncheon of Yelp friends and to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the special lunch box (bento box) and think it was the best choice of the day! (But everyone I was with thinks they got the best item of the day - always a great sign!) Miso soup, 4 or 5 tempura items, half a spicy tuna roll, salad, and the entree of the day - in this case, very well seasoned beef and onions on rice.  Everything is consistently fresh and flavorful, and prices are fair.  Since I was aware of the \"bakery\" aspect of the cafe, I went in a few days before the lunch to order a surprise birthday cake. I was told the strawberry shortcake was the most popular, so I went with that. Everyone at the table loved it - and the birthday girl was sufficiently surprised and got to bring half of it home. The cake wasn't cheap - but while I didn't check the dessert prices for individual slices - I am guessing it would have been close to the same to order six separate desserts. So - if you have a decent size group - it's well worth it to buy the cake in advance!",

I'm not looking for odd molecular gastronomy or quirky dishes. That being said, what I am looking for is good food, at a good price. That is what Cherryblossom delivers.  I've had almost everything off the menu since I've moved to AZ, but my favorite has to be the Marsala Chicken. Yes, my favorite is an Italian dish. Here's the kicker though, it's homemade spinach pasta with a Marsala cream sauce, mushrooms, spinach and chicken. The kicker being the pasta if that went over your head. I've had it to go, to eat in, and even after already eating another meal. The service is attentive, a little curt but that's expected with the culture of it and it's all perfectly fine with me. Pricing is affordable, I don't drink alcohol so I cant say anything on that pricing. Food wise its very affordable.  Definitely a must visit if you're looking for good food at a good price, and aren't looking for a hip youngster environment, sorry hipsters and millennials this aint your jam.",

They were light and flavorful and served on top of a swirl of spicy Chinese mustard.    I wasn't so crazy about the texture of the Ramen noodles (seemed more like rice noodles), but that aside, my Cha-shu (Hakata with extra pork) was very tasty, and a generous portion.   I ordered the Korean Spicy Beef to go and it was delicious warmed for dinner later in the evening. It was mildly spicy and nicely seasoned.   Overall, I had a great experience. I'll be going back again, but skipping the ramen noodles next time. The prices seemed reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.",

Then she walked away when one of us was still trying to order. We were offered refills ONCE, way after we had finished our food. Then when we paid, our checks were switched and had to have them redone because some of us were being charged more than usual.

This may be the first 1 star review i'm doing too. Okay, so i came here with a company and we each ordered a ramen, that is, Cha-shu ramen and tam tam ramen. We each got an appetizer too, gyoza and vegetable tempura. Gyoza was okay, and so was vegetable tempura. The sauces were too watery but i didn't care much because we were waiting for the ramen. Our ramen comes out looking all delicious but the taste was nothing extraordinary. It was no more than just okay. The tam tam ramen broth just tasted like tabasco sauce, and overall it was too sour more than spicy so i couldnt finish it. I liked how it was nicely decorated inside and it surely is a nice restaurant but i think i was expecting too much out of it. In the beginning of the meal our waiter brought a tuna sashimi to our table, which we didn't order, so we didnt touch it but he had informed us he has another dish for us on its way so i thought they had a lunch special or something going on, and because neither of us eat raw fish we just let it sit on our table until we asked for our bill. I was still curious so i took half a bite of it and i was shocked how smelly the fish was, and that was one reason that made me decide to leave a one star review. Never have i ever had fish smell that bad in my life. Although i don't eat raw fish, i know how it's supposed to taste and smell like, but theirs was very very old. If i didn't think that was a free dish, i would have called someone to complain about it. It was THAT BAD. Before our waiter brings our check, he seemed to have realized he brought it to the wrong table and he takes it back to the kitchen without saying a word to us or asking questions, and a couple minutes after he took it to the table behind ours. I don't know if they made new ones or it was the same plate, but i would like to hear what the person who ordered it has got to say about the fish. Mediocre food and very bad raw fish. My favorite about this restaurant was my diet pepsi. I am glad i got a soft drink because after i tasted the fish i felt the necessity to wash my mouth.",

When finding a restaurant that has authentic food with appropriate pricing its downfall usually is it's interior. This may entail crumbling walls, dingy furniture, unwashed dining utensils, greasy tables and more. In Cherry Blossom this was most certainly not the case.  My experience at Cherryblossom was one I find rare these days. The lighting inside was very dim, which allows for a more intimate meal. Although the seating could have been more spacious, there is a comfortable amount of room for conversation when dining with friends or family. The decor throughout the store consisted of Japanese posters and an abundant amount of Japanese delicacies. I found this to be very enlightening as I not only look for restaurants that contain good food, but an eye-opening experience into other cultures. The outside of this restaurant does not do justice into conveying this restaurants \"True colors\". The saying, don't judge a book by its cover, is one customers have to keep in mind when attending.  When I arrived I was greeted by a very attentive and kind waitress. She notified me that at the time of my arrival was Happy Hour. I felt the Happy Hour menu was quite bland so to those looking for dirt-cheap sushi you are not going to get much out of that menu.  In the end I ordered the standard Rainbow Roll and Caterpillar Roll. The main components of the Rainbow Roll consisted of  sashimi, crab and avocado. This roll was deliciously moist, due to the avocado and tasted fresh. I can say the same for the Caterpillar Roll. It consisted of avocado, cucumber and eel. The eel gave for a juicy flavor and the avocado on the outside paved way for a soft texture that I highly enjoyed.   When the check arrived to my table it totaled out to be $13.00. The Rainbow Roll and Caterpillar Roll's were both $6.50 each. I would have to say these prices are pretty decent given these rolls are not only very prevalent in Japanese restaurants in Arizona, but classic. I truly believe those looking for some delicious sushi, but don't have a lot in their wallet should try out this restaurant. Like I said before, the only downside was the Happy Hour menu. It did not consist of a variety of foods. It seemed it only had appetizers and not very many entrees. If you are not interested in sushi, but want to go for another Japanese dish I would suggest that you try their Ramen. Its important I stress this restaurant is not a designated sushi restaurant. In fact, I heard about this place from a close Japanese friend of mine who, and like many others, raved about their Ramen. With that said, there is an eclectic amount of food for everyone. Cherryblossom offers something for everyone.  In conclusion I rate this restaurant four out of five stars. In my experience I was greeted by a nice and attentive waitress. The food was well priced and tasted deliciously fresh. Its atmosphere felt authentic to Japanese culture, which made the overall experience eye-opening. I dropped one star for the restaurant's Happy Hour menu, but don't let this differ you form ever coming. It was great!",

No idea what the Italian ones are like, but I'll update this when I know. The atmosphere is very cozy- they really made the best of the space which I think was a fast food joint originally. Make time for the happy hour on weekdays for great deals. (Fun fact- they've won three Best of Phoenix awards)",

The ambience was lovely, clean place, and the waiter was nice(got our order out on time and checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay)  Tried the gyoza as an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely get this again next time :) For the entree I got the tan tan men ramen and my friend got the hakata ramen (she said it was very tasty!). Warning * do not eat this if you have a cut on your mouth or chapped lips! Lol It was very spicy especially if you are not used to it, but it had a good flavor to it. Maybe less pepper flakes next time? The noodles were cooked well and overall flavorful.  I was very pleased with the visit, we did have to wait a bit to get seated despite it being slow but nothing else too concerning. I will be returning :)",

But I'm seriously curious about how often that side gets ordered; seemed like the majority of customers were ordering the Japanese side of the menu. Good edamame and nicely flavored pork belly \"bites\", ill call them. I ordered an udon noodle ramen soup for my entree and it was delicious. I was also amazed by how much meat there was in the soup. Typically, ramen jips you of an actual amount of meat--not this place! Yum!",

    "text": "I live in Tucson and whenever I come into town, I try to have a meal at Cherry Blossom.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I am proud to say that I have been a semi-occasional diner for years.  Everything that I've had there has been tasty.  While they serve Italian and Japanese food, I've only ever eaten off the Japanese menu.  On my latest lunch visit, my sister and I tried a variety of dishes.  For appetizers we had the summer rolls and california rolls.  Both were really tasty, especially the summer rolls.  For the main course, I ordered the daily bento (I'm a sucker for a bento box) and my sister ordered the calamari salad (one of my favorite dishes here).  The food was excellent and we both left the restaurant completely stuffed.  My one criticism is that over the years, I have noticed a slight decline in customer service.  I remember they used to include a slice of banana bread in the bread basket, but now they charge for it.  Also, our lunch waiter was not very attentive.  We had to ask twice for certain items (i.e. chopsticks and spoons) and it took forever to get our check.  As much as I love cherry blossom, I had to dock it a star for that reason.  But I shall continue to frequent this restaurant for all of my Japanese food cravings.",

The chicken yakisoba noodles were great, not too much sauce and plenty of chicken; the philly roll was all right--tastes just like any other. My boyfriend was disappointed that the tempura roll was rolled into tempura flakes instead of flash fried. But overall, I enjoyed the food and would like to come back.",

The bowls are big, you get a good amount for your buck in my opinion.   The TanTan Men is good if you're looking for a spicy soup. The Miso is great if you're feeling a seafood soup. The Hakata soup; you will not go wrong ordering this bowl. The noodles, the broth. So good. The Cha-shu; is the Hakata but with MORE delicious pork included, you can't go wrong. And even if you don't normally eat a lot you'll have a hard time not wanting to eat the entire bowl. At least that's what I've experienced.   Because the place is popular and the space is small, you may have to wait awhile for service and to put in your order, but once you receive your delicious bowl of goodness you will quickly forget!",

And to have snoh right next door for dessert was perfect!    I ordered a dish called the Primavera w/ eggplant, chicken and red sauce.  You could either have Soba noodles or Tofu noodles.  I ordered the Soba noodles which was very interesting.  It is healthy and very tasteful.  The prices are inexpensive and within my strict budget.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  Its small but quaint.  We had nine people in our party and we just waited for about 15 min. Fortunately enough we were seated quickly.    I have been in AZ for 5 years, and I cannot find any Asian food that compares to the restaurants in San Jose California where I am from, and this was one of the best places I have gone to.

    "text": "Ramen is a noodle dish near and dear to my heart. There are few noodle dishes out there that can satisfy the palate as well as a solid bowl of ramen. The key to good ramen is the excelling of three primary ingredients: the noodles, the broth, and the protein.   The noodles here are very well made with good consistency, texture, and fantastic compatibility with the broth. The broth itself has that signature creaminess, saltiness, and thickened smoothness that ramen broth should have. It gives the noodles a fine delicious dressing.  Alas, the cha-shu pork is where the dish fails to amaze. While the BBQ flavor of the pork is adequate, CherryBlossom chooses to go the lean route in the preparation. The result is a piece of pork that is thick and devoid of fat. This flaw is a fatal one. Ramen noodles were designed in such a way that its fullest potential can only be achieved with fatty pieces of meat. In a True ramen dish, one seeks out the fatty piece of meat and treasures every bite as it enhances the richness of the broth and is counterbalanced by the starchiness of the noodles. CherryBlossom foregoes this authentic vision and opts for a healthier alternative. While it still delivers on most fronts, my inner samurai still desires that extra reach of flavor.  Other reviews on Yelp also recommend their banana bread. However, I must condemn their banana bread and anybody else on Yelp who sponsors it. Their banana bread is incredibly dry and has a grainy texture quality to it. The flavor itself is very bland and the banana element is barely detectable. A shame.  However, the dinner rolls that do come with your meal are quite good! They have a softness and fluffiness about them that nearly rivals Hawaiian rolls. Freshly baked and packed with flavor. An unexpected surprise!  At the end of the day, the entire experience was pretty good but far from great. CherryBlossom offers an eclectic mix of different cuisines and dishes. Though the ramen could not satiate, I am willing to return to test the other dishes. To be continued...",

Like a lot of restaurants in Phoenix, CB is in a strip mall which I'm starting to get used to.   Went at lunchtime, it wasn't crowded initially, but filled up quickly. Started out with the vegetable tempura. It was okay, just a basic tempura. I ordered the grilled salmon lunch special which came with brown rice and salad. I wasn't crazy about the salad dressing, but the salmon was awesome. Two substantial, well seasoned fillets. With a lunch special you expect the smallest fillet with a ton of rice, not at CB.    My hubby ordered the sausage in red sauce as an appetizer and the hot beef salad. I don't eat meat so I didn't his food (bummer), but he seemed very pleased,   I look forward to returning and trying some Italian dishes. Also, CB is extremely clean and the staff is attentive.",

She was attentive to what we wanted and commended us for being on time to our reservation. We each ordered different dishes and everyone seemed to really enjoy what they had ordered. The food came out fast which is a huge plus. I ordered the chicken katsu curry and it was very tasty. I liked the radish that came with the dish but it was still missing a bit of a lemon zest taste. I think it would have been better with a side of Kimchi or something similar to it. Last we ordered a green tea mousse cake with red bean filling. Hands down the best green tea cake I've ever had. The atmosphere, the service, the food and the price is all great. I highly recommend this place. Definitely will be back again!",

    "text": "So this place just weirds me out too much. Ramen for dinner and an italian pastry from their dessert window? Makes me think that they were not sure what kind of restaurant to open. In other words, they didn't know which would be better, so they just serve both. If their Asian food was really that amazing, wouldn't they just eschew serving the Italian in the same place, and focus on Asian? Or vice-versa?   So, while their noodles were good, they were missing all the other things that I like about Asian spots...namely, the hot sauces, diced chili in vinegar, asian drinks, maybe some coconut drink/dessert, and other non-noodle things that make an asian noodle place amazing. This is a place for old Phoenicians that think they are going outside of their comfort zone. For them, they are, and it is great. They experiment while they have their trusted spaghetti to fall back on. For a well seasoned Asian food eater like myself, this place fails.",

    "text": "BEWARE OF ORDERING TO GO  I was super excited to try this place after my mom told me about it since we often go to Tokyo Express next door. So we decided to order 2 Hakata Ramen bowls to go after seeing delicious pictures of them on here. First the price online was roughly $6 so I expected the bill to be about $15, but it was $18 for 2 ramen bowls which I don't mind because I just assumed the price increased. After running a couple more errands we returned home excited to eat the ramen and opened the box to see just noddles and just soup. I was extremely disappointed especially after seeing their beautiful presentation online. The soup only have one whole piece of pork with a couple strands extra. The egg is my favorite part and I saw no egg however I don't know if that's just because it's and extra add-on. However overall the soup base was alright, but really without the extra flavors that were supposed to be included it just tasted like instant cup ramen I can buy at the grocery store. Maybe it was just a mistake that they didn't include everything, but in my opinion, it would've been nice to be informed if it would cost extra to include other sides. I wouldn't mind trying this restaurant again however I most likely will not be ordering take out.",

QUALITY- I have tried many different plates, gone during dinner and lunch time and I can confidently say that the food has ALWAYS tasted the same for me. It has never been a disappointment, food wise, and that is my go to place for the ika yakisoba, katsudon, peach sake drinks & other delicacies. Food has always tasted and looked 10/10 for me.   SERVICE- the is what has always fluctuated for me. There are some people here that have worked for a while, even years, & they have given me exceptional service. Now the last time I went I had an unpleasant experience with our server, but I'm just going to assume she was new & with time she could better & learn not to rush people (especially when they aren't busy). Service is 8/10.   PRICE- I personally feel like the prices are priced fairly. The food was cheaper before the minimum wage went up in AZ so it's understandable that certain plates have gone up $1-2. Price has been 10/10 for me.   OVERALL- I have and will always support this local restaurant. If you are from out of state, I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.",

The texture of the meat was really good. I also like how they give you a good amount of meat. The gyoza and sushi was good as well. I like how they have a variety of options to choose from.",

We did not like the ramen(Supposed to be Sichuan spicy) as broth was just mild and grilled chicken has no spice in it.

Unfortunately I felt that the broth wasn't very flavorful at all. Also, There was barely any minced pork which I assumed was the main point of the dish. The dish itself was supposed to be spicy and it honestly wasn't.   The second time, I ordered the yaki soba with chicken. I also ordered the rice dish that has the shrimp tempura (can't remember the name of it). The yaki soba noodles seemed different to me, in fact they honestly looked like spaghetti noodles. The flavor was also pretty bland and I was really expecting it to be super flavorful based on all the pictures. The rice bowl was extremely basic with 4 shrimp tempuras on a bed of brown rice. The shrimp tempura was pretty soggy as well.   I typically try and eat at restaurants twice before I give a review. Would I give this place another try? Sure, but I'll try other places around the area first. The service isn't too bad and the employees are nice.",

Once we were seated and our drinks were ordered it took another 35 minutes for the food to come out.  They were quite busy for a Sunday night.  The food was overall good, we ordered our Ramen and udon soups...the Ramen was average in my opinion, we also ordered a spicy beef noodle dish and some gyozas which was simply delicious, some eggplant with bell peppers dish...the bell peppers were quite good and lastly two orders of mabo sara udon, which wasn't bad at all.  The waiter and waitresses were super friendly and attentive, but the speed of the place is too slow, I almost starved to death this night.

My favorite is the happy hour, a generous and still reasonably priced menu from 3-6pm of Sushi, Calamari, and other dishes/alcoholic beverages.  It's somewhat peculiar to have Asian/Italian influenced meals, but they are well done and fairly fast in turn around.  Don't expect much leniency when it comes to showing up towards the end of happy hour - if you don't have a table before 6, you're out of luck.  I am glad I don't live close - I would eat here daily the food is that good.  Caution should be used driving here; especially during rush-hour.

The decor is similar in style to La Madeline or other French inspired eateries. It was decently busy when we walked in for dinner the previous times we ate here, but there was little to no wait for a table.  I've tried some ramen entrees, and a cold noodle dish here. The cold noodle dish (Hiyashi chu-ka) was a huge portion, filled with chicken, noodles, and veggies. The sauce was light but got a little too sweet for me after the first few bites. The ramen broth is excellent here. It's full flavored, and you will want to keep eating more and more! I've had the spicy ramen and the cha-su ramen, and I think the cha-su ramen's the best of the two. The spicy ramen was indeed quite spicy! But it was still good to eat, with a robust broth, bean sprouts, and noodles.  Service is friendly, and drinks are refilled as needed. They bring out a basket of bread and sweet Melba-type toast to your table, which is nice to munch on while you are waiting for your meal.  Overall, a good place to get your noodle fix.",

    "text": "Classy. Quiet. Leaves nothing to be desired. Except maybe a larger stomach.   I ordered the Spicy Korean Beef, which is cooked with egg noodles and green vegetables. I also ordered the spicy tuna roll. My boyfriend decided on the chicken yakisoba. Both of our plates came with a salad (various greens including cabbage, baby spinach, and iceberg). And drizzled with a ginger/sesame dressing. I also decided on the iced coffee (vanilla because Im a plain Jane). The server provided me with a short glass of syrup and my iced coffee with a side of creamers. Its assembly required, but I enjoyed this, I feel that most places serve coffee as 90% milk and 10% coffee anyway (heres looking at you Starbucks!).  My main dish of tender Korean beef and noodles was perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of spice for me. The noodles were wonderfully cooked, they still had that bit of resistance to them which makes you feel that youre eating food. Not slurping down canned noodle soup.  My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken yakisoba, which if I may add, he is an incredible picky eater. So to find a place that suited us both, Im ecstatic to say the least.  We ended with the strawberry and chocolate mouse cake. Delightful. Very light, but full of strawberry flavor, and the richness of the chocolate was the perfect pairing.    The motif is warm and inviting. The music is instrumental, but of the piano nature. I cannot explain how difficult it is to find a classy and quiet, locally owned place that doesnt have 7 tvs blaring the most current sport with todays \"hits\" deafening you over their sound system.  We are sold on this patch of utopia. Its a bit of a drive from where we are, but it is more than worth the trek.   I HIGHLY recommend that you add this cafe to your list of places to eat. Come with an empty stomach, because you wont want to stop eating.",

    "text": "Background: I've been coming to Cherryblossom for lunch several times a month for several years. I took the family for dinner last night and, while the food was of its usual good quality, our service really dragged the experience down:  Me, to waiter: Is the calamari salad on this happy hour menu the same as the one in the seafood bento box lunch special you sometimes have?  Waiter: We have never had a seafood bento box special. You must have had it next door. (There is a Tokyo Bowl next door)  Me (taken aback): No, I'm really sure I had it here. It's my favorite thing on your lunch menu. (thinking to myself: And I've never eaten at Tokyo Bowl. I have standards.)  Waiter: No, we don't have a seafood bento. I should know, I created the menu. You must have had it next door.  At that point I wanted to prove I was not crazy so I pulled up a picture I had taken of the seafood bento the last time I ordered it. (I do sometimes take pictures of my food when it's really exceptional looking.) I showed him the pic and described every single item in the bento. He insisted that the calamari salad in the pic was actually a Thai beef salad. I explained that our family doesn't eat beef. He walked away without replying, then ignored us for the rest of our meal. Oh, he refilled our waters, he just wouldn't speak to us. We ended up needing more food and I tried to place my order four separate times before getting the barest hint of a nod from him.   I asked another server when we left; she said he is one of the head waiters. That makes it even weirder. Put aside the fact that a head waiter should know the menu at the restaurant where he works. What benefit does he get from telling a longtime customer she is wrong about what she ordered at his restaurant? It's not about you, dude. It's about the restaurant. Put your ego aside and serve the customers.",

Unfortunately, as I walked in with my sister after an outing at the Science Museum, the food wasn't as delicious as I remembered it to be - maybe this happened to be the, \"Cheerleader effect.\" In a group it's good - but get it alone, and it's not as good as you thought it was.  Our waitress was nice, but scarce after receiving our food, and our second refill. There was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm.  I got the Ten-don, which is the tempura fried shrimp and ricebowl, being the hungry monster that I am, I ate the whole thing! It was a good and simple dish :)  My sister got the Katsu Pork Curry, and I noticed the plate was a bowl, no longer a deep plate that they used to use in the past. She wasn't happy with this dish as we've had better at another local Japanese restaurant; the curry didn't taste very much like curry, the sauce was bland, and she noted the piece of pork was small compared to the price she paid.  We ended up leaving after slipping the payment into the folder and didn't bother sticking around to wait for her to pick up the money.  I think this will be our last time eating at Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe while in Phoenix :(",

    "text": "When I first heard about this restaurant, I was a little confused about the concept. Italian and Asian is not a typical combo, and I assumed that this restaurant would do one way better than the other. I started out ordering Asian dishes when I first started visiting. I was a little too scared to experiment with the Italian menu, as their Asian dishes are quite good, so why would I stray? My husband decided he would give it a shot one night, and it turns out that their Italian dishes are equally as good as their Asian dishes.   Here are my favorites: - Hakata Ramen: a flavorful Ramen, with coconut milk and pork, one of the few places that offers Ramen in Phoenix, and also one of the best!  - Pad Thai: This is pretty authentic, the sauce had great flavor and the portion is generous  - Rei-Shabu: slices of rare beef, with noodles, and a flavorful sesame dressing, perfect for a hot day  - Bolognese: This sauce is homemade and very flavorful with lots of meat  - Chicken marsala: Not very traditional as it's more of a cream sauce, but it still tastes great, is full of flavor, and the spinach noodles add a nice touch  They offer reasonably priced lunch specials and sushi too. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow, so don't come here if you're in a rush. However, they're always very friendly and nice. So if you're in the mood for Italian but your dinner dates wants sushi, you're in luck as CherryBlossom offers both in a delicious way.",

The complimentary bread that comes in the beginning of the service is always warm and delicious. You run the risk on getting yourself full on the bread so be careful! The desserts are absolutely delicious too, and it can vary depending on when you go.   Servers are friendly and, although the food doesn't come out as quickly as some other places, it's not \"slow\" by any means, especially since this place is always packed when I go. You might want to try and avoid peak hours if you don't have a reservation on weekends.  The downside is that this place needs its own designated parking lot. There is a parking lot in front of restaurant, but it's shared by like 9 or 10 other stores, so a popular restaurant such as this can fill it up quickly.",

That was a pretty good sign of things to come.  I wasn't sure of what to expect from this place cuisine wise, as I was hoping for Vietnamese food but all the places on Camelback were closed. Some sort of Asian cuisine was needed, and CherryBlossom seemed like our only option.  We came in, got our tofu Pad Thai and shrimp lettuce wraps. The food came out promptly, but I'm guessing that's because they half-assed it food wise. The shrimp lettuce wraps were incredibly gritty, and I felt like I was eating small rocks. The Pad Thai has way too much fish sauce, which overpowered the whole dish. The food wasn't too bad, but definitely didn't live up to all of the rave reviews.  Service was prompt, and the food was cheap, so that's a plus.",

Sometimes I feel like I'm paying a bit too much, but I've started frequenting the specials and Happy Hour menu, which has alleviated some of that. I've tried the sushi, the gyozo bowl, the salads, and some of the pasta dishes. Everything has been pretty good.  The gyozo bowl is awesome. It reminds me of the spicy Korean ramen my mom would make me with mondu (Korean dumplings). It's pretty spicy and flavorful. I love sitting at the bar and ordering--things come out faster and you can watch with excitement as the cooks prepare the food. I've noticed a lot of the flavors run together and taste similar, but I'm okay with that because they're good flavors.  From the outside, it really does look like a shady asian spot, but the inside is quirky and classy. The walls are brick and the decorations are well-chosen. It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour.",

    "text": "My fiance and I decided to visit this place based on the awesome prices and the good reviews.  We got there and the place was really cute.  It's pretty cozy inside, like someone said, Asian European.  The menu is huge.  I'm typically a picky person and will only find one or two things on any given menu that I want to eat, but this menu...I would try half of it.  However, I had a hankerin' for sushi, so that's what I ordered.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have an individual selection of nigiri to choose from, but they did have a combo option for nigiri, which is usually what I like to see anyway.  I decided to try the Philly roll and the Alaskan roll.  I was also concerned this might not fill me up, so I also ordered a bowl of miso ($2).  First of all, the miso was delicious.  It had raw cabbage in it, which I didn't really like (nor have I seen it before), but other than that, it was one of the best miso soups I've ever had.  Secondly, the Philly roll was awesome!  It was made with smoked salmon, which made it a million times more delicious than usual. The Alaskan roll had cooked salmon, and it was good, but couldn't compare to the Philly roll with smoked salmon.  Also, I didn't realize they served bread at the table (wasn't really expecting that at an Asian restaurant).  We had two rolls and two cinnamon and sugar crostinis in our basket.  They were both good.  Nothing special about the rolls, though.  Just your typical dinner roll.  Because of the bread, I ended up being super full at the end of my meal, which I wasn't expecting at all.  My fiance ordered the shrimp pad thai.  He asked for super-extra hot, but it came not spicy at all.  They gave him chili sauce, though, which helped him out.  He absolutely loved it.  Normally, he doesn't really like Thai or Japanese food that much, but he couldn't stop talking about how good his food was.  That's a giant thumbs up for this place, just for impressing him with Thai food.  Overall it was excellent.  We went at 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  I see that as a great sign.  Our service was normal, nothing to complain about, so overall, the two of us gives Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe 5 stars :)",

I will say their green tea is incredible, though it comes out EXTREMELY hot. Order it first, for you'll need 30 minutes for one cup to cool.   Oh, and the banana nut bread they serve rocks. That may be the one redeeming quality of CherryBlossom.   Having tried it twice, I can safely say I have no reason to ever go back.

I have not seen the incompetent server that ruined my last experience here but the servers we have since then had have all been perfect. Keep it up Cherry Blossom and I'll keep coming back!",

    "text": "A very solid 3.75 star review :) So, I leave my last job site at Camelback & 7th Ave. starving and looking for something non-chain and non-hamburger.  I start to head east and Cherry Blossom suddenly popped into my view.  I've certainly read about them over the years, never made it by so now's my chance! I am so glad I ended up here for lunch, especially this ccccooollllddd week (hey, at least for Phoenix).  Nothing goes down better on a cold day than soup, for me at least particularly Asian noodle soups.  Like Gabi mentions Phoenix is definitely lagging behind San Jose, Honolulu, Chicago, name your place-they all got mindblowingly good ramen/noodle house type restaurants. My opinion is that the Valley has more Southeast Asians (Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian) than Japanese so pho or tom yum gai isn't as hard to find as good ramen.  Cherry Blossom's version is not like any I've had before-I usually simply order the cha su ramen in whatever size is not the gigantic bucket full.  Cherry Blossom's was not a clear broth, rather it was almost a creamy white laden with seaweed and pork and those wonderful noodles....I could eat a WHOLE lot of this...coupled with eight pieces of California roll, salad with some pretty solid ginger dressing, and bread (??) with a tropical iced tea set me back $11.   Very good food and good value I'd say too!  I see you again soon Cherry Blossom!!",

We were both super happy with our food - practically licked the bowls!  Our server (think his name was Brandon), was attentive and prompt.  The mango lemonade was also delicious.  We recently moved here, and I miss my favorite ramen places in Minneapolis.  But, Cherryblossom looks like it might fill the void!",

The restaurant and kitchen are well staffed, service is prompt and courteous, the atmosphere is small, subtle, and somewhat intimate.  I appreciate that they aren't afraid to spice things up - may I suggest the tantan-men?  Overall, a great place for noodle lovers like myself.  From my experience, the attention to the cuisine may suffer just slightly on a busy weekend evening. Try this place on a slower weeknight an it may improve your first impression.",

    "text": "From the second you enter the door, it's pretty obvious that Cherryblossom isn't exactly your usual Japanese restaurant. With the works of Chagall adorning the walls right next to the iconic Japanese beckoning cat statue (aka Maneki Neko), the interior decor definitely alludes to the nature of the food served within its walls. Though firmly rooted in traditional Japanese cuisine, Cherryblossom also has select offerings from across Asia and Europe as well. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion cuisine... more like a meeting of traditions (with some exceptions, of course).  As it's name would suggest, Cherryblossom is first and foremost a noodle house. With a wide range of noodles dishes, Cherryblossom definitely does not disappoint in this category. From Japanese noodle soups to stir-fried noodles to Italian pasta, there are more than enough options to suit an array of different palettes. There's even a tofu noodle option for those trying to keep low carb or gluten-free. In addition to the many noodle dishes available, Cherryblossom also serves a wide range of other choices as well. Sushi, rice dishes, salads and assorted tempura are all on the menu to tempt your taste buds.  One of my usual go-to favorites is the Vege-Ten noodle soup. Served up in a large bowl, it's a hearty dish featuring either udon (thick wheat) or soba (thin buckwheat) noodles (I'll get either depending on my mood) in a miso soup with an assortment of vegetable tempura placed on top. Although this is usually filling enough for a complete meal unto itself (just because I'm still a big sushi lover even after going vegetarian), I'll also frequently get a vegetable roll (avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrot, Inari tofu, and kaiware) to accompany my hearty bowl of tastiness... But no matter what you end up ordering, I doubt that you'll be going away unsatisfied.  So a small confession... While writing this, I totally got an urge to try one of Cherryblossom's desserts. And since I'm always so full from the meals that I get there, I've never had the opportunity to try one of the pretty desserts inside the glass case. So for just you (and my tummy), I swung out to get a piece of their green tea mousse cake (something that I had been admiring the last couple of times that I had been in)... Although you may think that this cake might be something akin to a typical European chocolate mousse cake, it's most definitely an Asian-style dessert. Light with delicate and subtle flavors, this cake features a thick layer of green tea mousse sandwiched between a thin base of white cake and a layer of red bean paste on top and is served with some fresh berries alongside. Like many Asian desserts, it's not what the typical American palette would consider sweet. It's actually very much like the kinds of cakes that I grew up eating from Chinatown in LA... Maybe not everybody's cup of tea, but I found it pretty good.  So long story short... If you find yourself hungry (or even just a little peckish) in the Central Phoenix area, I would highly suggest stopping into Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

I had the Rei-Shabu (rare sliced beef on cold noodles), Dad had pad thai, the brother had pork katsu, and boyfriend had hakata (pork ramen). We started with some appetizers...summer rolls, the boys had a spider roll, and we had an order of the Cajun soft-shell crab. My beef and noodles were delicious, not as rare as I had expected (this was a good thing, I was a little nervous after I ordered it), the summer rolls were good, but the Cajun soft-shell crab was AMAZING. My dad is from Boston and eats a lot of seafood and we eat a lottttt of crab and this was one of the better places in Phoenix I've had soft-shell crab. It wasn't overly fried like some places (ahem, RA) and the Cajun seasoning was amazing, along with the dipping sauce (I ended up pouring the leftover sauce over my noodles - YUM)...if you are a fan of crab, you have to try it! Overall, everything was great, everyone loved their food, decent prices and something for everyone (next time we might try the Italian items...interesting mix of food at this place!).",

We saw our waitress once to take our order and then she never came near our table again. No refills to water or my iced green tea. She didn't even show up after I had to get up to ask for boxes and the check. Do not go here when it's even mildly busy, you'll be as annoyed as we were this weekend. Oh also, she was kind of argumentative while taking our order... it was odd. It was like she was trying to get us to not order certain things...   Original Review: What a great little place. I definitely didn't expect the tiny strip mall noodle joint I pass on my way to work to be this good. It looks kind of crappy from the outside and the road sign just says \"Noodle Cafe.\" But lo and behold, you enter into a cute, stylish restaurant.  I do have to say, I was a little weirded out by the thought of Asian/Italian cuisine, but was happy to find out that the two stay separate. They had sushi, noodles, salads, and pasta. Plus a kinda decent sake selection.  My friend and I got the unagi salad (big enough for a meal or to split) and then the seafood yakisoba noodles. The salad was excellent and the unagi (eel) was fresh, well cooked, and really tasty. The noodles were so good that the lady sitting next to me saw mine (and how i was enjoying myself) and ordered it too.",

If you order your drinks first, order your next round AND YOUR FOOD the next time the server visits your table to check up on you. Take care of it all at once. Even your waters, as they are not automatic. I can't stress this enough. Make sure your server is WRITING STUFF DOWN. Some servers think they can memorize it, then they get it wrong. Like what happened to one person in our party. It's just so hectic there that losing track is easy. ALL AT ONCE, BE SURE THEY WRITE IT DOWN.

We went over the weekend and I must agree that it was up to par and I grew up eating authentic Japanese food at home.  The have a very good happy hour Monday thru Friday from 3 to 6pm. The rolls and a few dishes along with alcohol are priced anywhere from $2-$5. I suggest you get there early. We got there around 5:15 and had an hour wait. We didn't make it for happy hour so we ordered off the regular menu.  I had hot Soba (buckwheat noodle) soup and Tofu Salad. The Soba soup was very good, I would skip the tofu salad next time, there wasn't anything special about it.   We also shared the Alaskan roll which comprised of cooked salmon, crab, cucumber and avocado. It was really good.   For those of you who have never had Japanese style Italian food, it's quite a treat. If you can imagine Italian pasta with a twist such as soy sauce flavor, etc., it's something everyone who enjoy Japanese flavors should check out.  We also noticed the dessert counter and decided to order a few things to go.  I got the strawberry shortcake - which is a very popular dessert in Japan and they made it perfectly.  Pound cake type sponge, fresh strawberry, light cream and overall not too sweet. My friend tried the chocolate tart and it was soooooooooooooooo good!  Check it out if you live in the area!",

Went in for lunch with my fiancee who had been there several times before and was raving about it.  We were treated very rudely by a young male waiter, who I approached about it, and after he denied being rude and argued with me, I asked to talk to the manager.  She was very apologetic and assured us that it would never happen again.  The way she handled it was very professional and she completely made us happy during the remainder of our visit.  I had the Hot Thai Beef Salad, a lunch special, which was absolutely delicious.",

They were not wrapped properly and just fell apart!   The waiter only asked everyone else if they were ok or if they needed anything and just ignored us even though we were only about a foot away from everyone else.   We got our bill while we were still eating didn't even ask if we were ready for the bill. I mean everything that a bad waiter could be could be found with this guy.

There weren't that many options and I had a hard time finding anything that jumped out at me. Many of the lunch options were for rice or salad. I really wanted noodles, ie a noodle bar.   I went for a Udon Combo Special with a California Roll. The roll was whatever, but the chicken in my soup was basic and kind of bland.   The food was average, but it was the service that left me unimpressed. The waiter was short and was very impersonal. He made my table feel rushed and as if we were an inconvenience for patronizing the restaurant. When we were ready to pay our bill, we asked for a spit check and he proceeded to tell us that he \"couldn't do tax in his head\" so basically too bad. We decided to spit the check 4 ways to be as easy as possible. Then as we were leaving he reprimanded us for not asking for a spit check before hand. I think it would have been nice for a server to be observant and ask us if we needed that rather than expect the table to make that known. A little foresight and customer service would have made a huge difference.",

I'd definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality I'd the pork improved. The rest of the ramen was so tasty it didn't matter!   Also, for take out the service was super quick and friendly. The prices are great, too!

Empty stomach, with Kunoichi on my left I joined the stream of the culinary conscious at the doors of CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe!  Immediate greetings, short wait, professional server introduced himself as Joshua.  We had drinks, bread (free!), apps and dinner but passed on dessert with lingering looks back as if to validate the mutual decision  I had studied the menu before but that had been weeks prior.  Ended up ordering the most popular items on the menu.    Korean Beef : Seoul-ful  Culinary Thought: Flattened, juicy, smoky and perfect temperature.   Ninja Eating Plan: Over noodles, with chili paste. It was consumed quicker than a Japanese shrike dives for meals in July..  Pad Thai : Rad  Culinary Thought: It was almost to beautiful to start eating.    Ninja Eating Plan: She said it was the best Pad Thai she had ever consumed.  She also noticed a difference in CBN Cafe's Pad Thai noodle compared to all others she has tried.  Kunoichi tend to notice every \"little bit.\"  Calpico Beer: Summer Drink of 2013?  Culinary Thought: Refreshing and different.  Ninja Eating Plan: Helped to calm down the tongue on several occasions of too much chili paste (hands were shaky after a successful morning mission)  Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: When breaking your solemn vegetarian vow it is good to exercise within a week of consuming any meat product.  This Ninja has enjoyed the experience and plans on returning before the first clouds of Winter stretch out over the valley horizon.",

Despite the sheer amount of people, there was room for parking and the service was still pretty fast. The dining room is rather small, but they manage to fit quite a few people in there. The decor is nice and subtle.   Even though it was busy, the hot tea came out hot, as did our food. They gave us a basket of rolls to eat while we waited which were warm and soft. I had the Hakata Ramen. It was awesome. There is enough in the bowl to make two meals of it. If you prefer large amounts of meat in your ramen, I recommend getting the 'extra pork' version, as the Hakata only has a few slices in it. The broth was flavorful and the noodles were very soft. As I looked around the packed room, I could see other people's plates- and everything looked pretty darned good- I wish I could have eaten more.   I'll definitely be going back.",

They have homemade desserts too. The prices were amazingly low, for what was served. I have been telling everyone about this place! Make reservations - it gets filled up. It is Phoenix' best secret eatery!",

    "text": "This is the old Cherry Blossom Bakery where i go to whenever i crave for Japanese pastries. a friend of mine has been raving about this place for quite sometime now. here's my verdict:   Service: 5 Stars  I think it takes skills for a waiter/waitress not to write down what we order, especially for a party of 5 or more. Drinks was top off all times.   Food :   Complimentary rolls: 4 Stars  Dinner Rolls was average but WOW! the banana bread is off the hook. i ended up buying a loaf to go.   Sushi: 3 Stars  another average item. nothing special or different.   Shrimp Tempura: 4 Stars.  hmmm, it came bundle with what i thought was zucchini to my surprise it was Japanese eggplant. Yummy!! the shrimp was a little over cook but the panko batter made up for it.   Yakisoba Chicken: 1 Star  i was not impress with this meal alt all. it taste more like a middle eastern shis-kabob with noddles.   Thai Beef Salad: 1 Star  not happy at all. the spiciness was too overpowering to the point to where the other flavors just disseminated. imagine that on top of a garden salad. \"uh, can i get a to go box please?\"   All in all it was not bad maybe next I'll try a different entree. this is the reason why I'm skeptical about going to so called \"Fusion\" places. but hey I'm always open for something different. isn't that what makes life worth living?  :)",

The strip mall and surrounding area seems sort of wearing down.   However, as i step into the little cafe... The aroma of banana bread tingle my sense of smell. But wait a minute.. Banana bread in a Japanese restaurant? The place is an Asian fusion themed cafe. I really loved this place but lunch time during the weekday is usually a bad time to go. Pack with customers from nearby office building during the lunch hours.   The best part of the cafe is the banana bread that they served before your meal.   I usually order the Champon, a delicious concoction of seafood and noodle in the delicious champon broth... mmm ... foood. A must try it for those of you that are adventure enough. Reminder.. it's a seafood dish.. so there will be \"seafood\", which include calamari and so on.  A great place for couples for lunch or dinner.. small wine list but at a reasonable price..   The menu seems to be at a reasonable price. Great place to have a enjoyable meal during the late afternoon or early evening.",

    "text": "Due to a craving for Gelato Spot tonight, I got on Yelp to find a new retaraunt in the Biltmore area to try before indulging in pumpkin pie gelato. The reviews (and a coupon) led us to CherryBlossom. Our expectations weren't very high when we saw the strip mall setting, but a decent crowd inside was a good sign. We were immediately impressed by the ambiance, attentive staff, and free bread. We ordered the edimame which was quite good. Our entrees were the Marsala Chicken with spinach pasta and the Pad Thai. Both were good, but not great. Once our food arrived, the staff seemed to dissappear. From reading the other reviews, it seems this is common here. After an eternity of hoping someone would come bring more water, we at least received the check and decided just to take off and get water at our next stop.  Summary - Good food that I'd eat again, but won't go out of my way to do so..",

For years I have been looking for a place that served a good bowl of niu rou tang mian and while my favorite Chinese late night food isn't served at Cherry Blossom, there are plenty of delicious noodle soups that will keep me happy until my next trip east.   The ramen was great, we had it yesterday night, but the beef iron pot was even better (todays lunch- yes we loved the place so much we went twice in 24 hours). The spring onions had been roasted before entering the soup and gave the broth a wonderful smoky flavor. The cabbage and tofu were tender and soaked up all of the lovely flavors of the broth. The iron pot was too big for me to finish alone. I needed some assistance halfway through so I suggest you take some friends and share!",

The seaweed salad is delicious.  I want to drink the dressing.    After having not been there for a bit, I sidled up the bar for a solo seaweed salad session, and the chef said, \"add avocado, yes?  I remember.\"  Whoa.  I was floored.  That's exactly what I wanted, and seriously, I think it may have been a year since I've been in.  And I'm not super talky, I'm not like a huge banter kinda chick.  So the fact that his memory performed so perfunctorily at such a perfect time, lord have mercy, I'm a fan.  Eat the seaweed salad.  The sushi is good.  The deserts are good.  The prices are appropriate.    If you see someone looking both ways, then slurping the dressing out of their salad bowl, you have busted me.

The place is really small though, that is my only gripe besides the fact that it shares a bathroom with Tokoyo Express next door.

    "text": "I recently moved to a couple blocks away from the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe, and naturally wanted to check them out for carry out.  In the two short months I've lived near them, I've dined in once but have gotten no less than 20 carry out meals -- they're THAT GREAT (IMHO)!  I've always loved steamed and lightly grilled dumplings, yet 99% of the time restaurants use super thick, gummy wrappings and also charge $7-8 bucks -- Cherryblossom uses the thinnest wrappers I've ever seen, and charge about half the going rate; they're absolutely first class, like everything they serve.  One may think it's kinda odd for what appears to be an Asian cafe serving Thai as well as sushi, as well as ITALIAN dishes too -- I sure scratched my head on that one!  BUT, it's like the staff says: \"we serve these different dishes with our own Japanese flair\".  How True.  I love Pad Thai, yet their way of making it is no different than how many households make their own versions of things like meatloaf... There's always an abundance of meat, tofu (that's fried prior to tossing it in) and things like snap peas, yielding one of the best \"non Thai\" versions I've ever had.  I've tried over a dozen of their dishes, and all I can say is I've never not enjoyed anything they've made for me to date.  I've yet to cross the proverbial line and order an Italian noodle/pasta dish, but that's only because in my being of Scicillian decent, I NEVER go out for Italian, simply because there's few that will ever compare to what my family made for us.  And, the entire staff is as great as the food they serve, and the whole place speaks to quality, from cleanliness to the ambiance.  I truly believe that if you don't like the CherryBlossom, you're probably the type of person who can find fault with just about any restaurant.  They also always have loaves of blueberry banana bread for sale in the waiting area, and almost always they're still warm from the oven. I bought one to bring to a friend's house who made dinner, and it was almost as good as what my Mom would make -- and that women knew how to cook!  Five stars is my rating, and I don't toss out stars like that often.",

    "text": "3 stars - Yelp says - A OK  That means, sure, I'd go back and I should state here and now that the 3 stars might not be all their fault but my fault too.  Plan to see mid-week movie with my daughter who teaches at junior high school and after school volleyball and we have plans for 7:45 movie which means time is compressed. Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian. Enough background...  Problem is, I had lunch too late and I arrived less than hungry. I'm equivocal what to order. I ask waiter for advice (mistake). I order cream soda and he comes back and asks me what flavor and listing too many choices. I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake.  Orders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.  So in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy.  I would definitely return a much wiser person and next time, I go with my gut instinct and order the Champon as I had intended to the first time.",

    "text": "Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe used to be a wonderful restaurant. I don't know what's going on there now, but they appear to be having problems retaining good staff. Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent.   Spicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor. Now, it's too spicy to eat, all from jalapeno peppers, and meanwhile the curry sauce has turned into a vague, bland gravy with no curry subtlety.   Meals come with free, fresh baked bread, which is nice. The owners briefly experimented by removing the free bread offering, but it returned a couple weeks later due to customer complaint. Lesson: don't remove the niceties your customers have come to expect from you.   The service here used to be fabulous; now it is mediocre on a good day and terrible on a bad day. You will be held hostage for your check. Your waiter will come ask \"is everything alright?\" before you have taken your first bite of food and then never return to see if you need anything else, avoiding all attempts at eye contact.",

It slid down the throat so deliciously gracefully, an addiction was created in one bite.   And the pad thai we ordered with chicken instead of shrimp. Another wow moment.

I was so impressed with the atmosphere and how well balanced the food was I returned with him after his interview.  Since then we have spent a good number of times going there for afternoon cake and tea and an early dinner. We were in love with this place.  The first time I brought him though, the waiter took our order, got our tea and coffee to us ten minutes later, then disappeared for 15 more minutes. We'd just gotten cake and tea, and the cake is pre-cut on shelves for display. There were only two other tables being served too. We thought it was a fluke and we were in no hurry, so we thought we'd try it again.  Since then we frequented the place weekly/biweekly. There is only one server who promptly served us, made us feel wanted, and kept us coming back. He'd refill our drinks and was on the ball. Sadly, any other waiter/waitress at this place doesn't seem to care and will leave you with empty drinks and plates for long spans of time. They will disappear (in the back?) and not return or look at you when they finally emerge. We're pretty patient and forgiving too, hence our re-visitation so many times (2+ months, at least once a week).  Our last visit the waiter didn't refill our glasses once for 25 minutes, then proceeded to sit at the sushi bar and eat dinner. He's the second best waiter there. We were asked by another waitress if we'd like refills as she brought us our check, 15 minutes after our waiter sat down to eat.  Love the place like mad, but we are not going back this time. :( The atmosphere is great. The food, delicious. But the employee culture is greatly lacking. Go only if you have a lot of time and don't mind not getting refills on your drinks (or sometimes not at all for your whole meal).",

(The Noodle Cafe is not forgettable - it's just that we're always trying new places so sometimes we forget to go back to places we love.)    Just like last time there were people waiting outside and we were told it'd be 20 minutes before we got a table.  It was really only about 15, but the food is SO worth the wait.  Tonight we ordered 3 sushi rolls: the crispy California, double crispy shrimp and the caterpillar roll.  All were super tasty! I love that they roll some of their rolls (the \"crispy\" ones) in panko crumbs - you seriously have to try one.  I think we may have ordered the same rolls last time because they're just that good!   Last time we went I enjoyed the Spicy Korean Beef dish SO MUCH that it was really difficult for me to try something new this time.  I made a last minute decision to try the TanTan-Men Ramen dish which is a \"Sichuan Style Very Spicy Noodle Soup with Minced Pork.\"  I was worried about the \"very spicy\" part only because I'm not usually that tough when it comes to Asian spices.  However, since the Spicy Korean Beef had been that perfect amount of spicy - the kind that makes your lips numb but isn't painful - I decided to be brave.  I am not kidding you - this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten!!!  Don't get me wrong, kids - it's SPICY.  My lips were numb, my tongue was tingly and my nose got a little runny.  At one point I may have told The Boy my stomach was on fire.  But I loved every minute of it!  And the best part is they gave me an enormous bowl full - so I had plenty to take home for a second round of yumminess!  The Boy has ordered the Pad Thai and Hakata Ramen - both tasty, but neither as tasty as my dishes! :) :)  In short - HA too late - DEFINITELY try  CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.  Especially if you like spicy food. :) :)",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a highly respected co-worker who really knows your food. I was looking forward to trying the Bento Box because it seemed like a good deal for only $10. It's really busy at lunch time but they have a decent lunchtime menu.  Sadly, we were seated and had our drink order taken, but no one approached to take our order for another 25 minutes. Our waiter kept telling us he'd be back in 2 minutes but eventually we had to flag down a different waiter just to take our order. On the flipside, he gave our table comp. adamame and eel sauce, no charge to make up for our wait. We received our food promptly after that. I was impressed with how much you get on the Bento Box. The salad had like an ounce of dressing on it so that wasn't all the great. The rice stuck together and the steak had a little bit too much fat still on it. The sushi was great and I liked the soup too. The best part was the eel sauce everthing could be dipped in.  I was so pretty bummed at the service, but I understood it was the lunchtime rush and the place was filled. Probably won't be going back soon though.",

Great menu / drink selection. *However- they did not carry  Kirin for you Japanese Beer Lovers.   We were seated right away- even during what I thought would be busy dinner time hours. I love restaurants that give you bread and butter. The banana nut bread was absolutely perfect. The Italian and the Japanese noodle selection was just enough for my indecisive mind.

I usually always get a seafood noodle dish (Nagasaki Sara Udon or Yaki Udon) and am always delighted at the flavors and large portions.

The noodles and other dishes were good as usual, but the service we received from the guy was otherwise.  That guy talked very fast which didn't bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests.  He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time.  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way, it had to be done three times.  It just gave me the impression that he didn't really pay attention to what we wanted.  This is the first time I went back since last year (rated 4/5 previously).  Hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers.",

    "text": "Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is an interesting place.  It's located in a dodgy strip mall east of Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub.  A weird location, but once you walk through the door of Cherry Blossom you are transported to a little rustic restaurant setting.  It was a nice surprise.  The place was busy.  We had to wait for a little bit because we didn't have a reservation.  Our table finally opened up and the three of us took our seats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices on the menu.  The place wasn't going to break us.  Another thing I noticed was that the menu items were all over the place.  Sushi, Japanese Food, Asian Noodles, Italian Pasta and so on.  Our waitress was an interesting soul.  I will leave it at that.  She showed up to take our order and deliver our food and that was pretty much it.  Our water glasses were empty for most of our dinner.  I ended up pouring our bottle of wine because my date refused to pour it.  He gave up on our waitress.  We had Spring Rolls with a peanut sauce and a Spicy Tuna Roll to start the dinner.  I enjoyed the spring rolls.  The spicy tuna roll was a little bit fishy.  I was scared.  My main dish was the Korean Spicy Beef.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I don't know why.  It was just okay.  The sauce was very rich.  Almost overwhelming.  I forced my self to keep eating.  I don't think I will order that again.  Cherry Blossom creates a nice environment and the prices are right.  No wonder it is crowded.  When I return I will try something else.  After all the menu is huge.  Something has to be good on there.  Three stars.",

I haven't paid too much attention to the Italian food.   Anyway, I went last night with my mother for a quick bite to eat.  The slow service is typical and doesn't bother me too much because the food used to be really good.  However, I ordered Baja Norte roll to start (jalapeno, spicy yellow tail) it was extremely fishy.  Also it came out at the same time as our entres, but like I said I'm used to so-so service here.  Maybe it was a bad night or something, but this fish stunk!  The noodles were pretty good, though the pork in my Gomoku Yaki Udon was kind of gristly.  I hope this was just a bad night, but judging by the recent reviews, I fear my local noodle bar has begun to slide...",

But never mind all of that.  My boyfriend ordered sushi even though I told him I wanted to leave.  And his food was decent, for Arizona sushi at a place that serves bread and 'clamari with anchoby tomato' (sic) as well.  Yeah, I eat food off of his plate.  You got a problem with that?  The upshot of my visit there is that I left unsure that boyfriends are worth all of this trouble, and unsure why Cherryblossom doesn't put a real bowl of ramen on the menu.",

But once you step inside, it's like the coziest little cafe/restaurant you could ever ask for-- quaint, hardwood furniture, the strange smells of banana bread and sushi somehow mixing harmoniously in the air, and a wait staff that just glows with kindness and authenticity.  It's because they know they've got something good to offer the world-- really delicious Asian pasta and rice dishes, super-tasty sushi, and the best miso soup I've ever had.  I didn't even like miso soup before trying theirs!  Don't like Asian? Their Italian pastas and seafood dishes are just amazing.    Look-- just go there, and ask for the banana bread.

Luckily, we weren't in a hurry or anything, so we both just hopped in the car and went back.    Now, the food was really good once we finally got to eat it, but I have a confession...I topped mine quite liberally with some Sriracha sauce before tasting it.  I don't know what the noodles actually taste like right out of the box.  They could be amazing, or they could be quite bland.  Whoops.  With Sriracha, they were pretty much mind-blowing.  We'll definitely try them again - I'd really like to try the tofu steak with mushroom sauce that Kerstin mentioned.  And next time, we'll be sure to check the order on the way out.",

A friend and former co-worker introduced me to this place, saying it reminded her of her mother's restaurant food... her mother from Japan. After munching on the most ethinically eclectic breadbasket (read other reviews, it's so True!), I had the udon with tempura shrimp and OMG I was stuffed about halfway through the steaming bowl of slurpy good noodles, flavorful broth, and giant, meaty shrimp covered in a tempura that, amazingly, had not disintegrated in the liquid. True comfort food, but I will warn - you may become drowsy after eating this. It's like Ambien was the secret ingredient. :)   At Matsuri, the line was long (as they were at almost every food booth) and I will say the $7 may have been a tad much for the styrobowl of ramen with bbq pork slices, but that was quickly forgotten as I tucked in. The steam rising from my precarious bowl promised flavor and did not fail to deliver. The pork was oooh so good; even my picky 5-yr-old was slurping up the noodles and munching on the smoky-tasting meat. The broth was filling and so good, perfect for what turned out to be kind of a blustery day.   Yeah, there's a wait sometimes. It's a small place, and helloooo... if it sucked, there would be NO wait. Man it up and chat with a stranger. You'll be standing like 2 inches from them heheheehh.",

I would say that I did like the Udon Ebi-ten, it's very simple. However, my personal favorite is the Iron Pot Udon Suki because it is flavorful and savory! It comes in an iron pot. I can already picture and smelling the sizzle from the noodles! I thought the Hakata Ramen was OK... nothing too special, I've had better ramen in the past. Same goes for the salad and the bread.

We get to see every dish that comes from behind the bar and usually make our dinner selection based on the \"order up\" items. It makes for an adventurous dinning experience.  My faves and must tries are the Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot-Pot Stickers in Spicy Soup and the Tori Nanban (add Sansai Vegi). I have the Gyoza soup first then whatever brothy goodness is still left at the bottom of my bowl I add to my Tori Nanban. It's weird but a tasty ritual.  The Iron Pot soups are also really good.  I've yet to have any of the Italian pasta dishes. Although they look just as good as the Asian items, it just doesn't seem right for me to order Italian. Who knows, maybe I'll give one a try on my next visit.   The CBNC does get busy with a wait during the lunch and dinner hours and service can be inconsistent outside of the bar which is another reason I sit at the bar.

The seasoning doesn't come in a high sodium content foil packet, no. This bowl of piping hot miso ramen is big enough for two and comes with a filet of salmon in it; bits of corn, scallions, and bean sprouts for a hearty bowl of YUM! I have had lots off the menu here as I really do love this place. The Miso Ramen is by far my favourite. My tiny always orders gyoza. The sashimi is fresh also! I have no complaints for this place.

    "text": "My introduction to Japanese cooking occurred years ago in Norwalk, Calif. It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.  I dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.  My initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.  After driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.  It's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.  Cherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.  A friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.  The California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.  Moving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef, this wasn't as spicy as I has hoped, but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste.  My eyes widened as my Ebi-Ten Udon Noodle ($8) arrived. It was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach. Along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting. Could this be what I've been searching for all of these years? After one sip my hopes plunged; just not quite the same. The flavor of the dashi, the basic soup stock used for udon, was a little too strong. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good bowl but, not quite the sensation I experienced so many years ago. Perhaps it's never as good as the first time.",

Ramen's okay, though inconsistent; I've had the Hakata a few times now, and it can range from overly salty to a bit lacking in flavor. When I want a bowl of noodles, I tend to go grab a bowl of pho since it's tastier and cheaper. Kind of miffed that I haven't been able to find a place in Phoenix that has good tonkatsu. Curry's nothing to write home about either - my mama makes better curry out of the Golden Curry cubes. You can't help but be discouraged when the curry tonkatsu at a Korean school cafeteria is way better than at your local Japanese restaurant. Definitely overpriced for the quality.  Perhaps I'm simply ordering the wrong dishes, from the look of other reviews, so I haven't completely given up on this place.",

    "text": "This review is seriously overdue, though I figured I could hold off on writing it since with over 500 reviews averaging out to 4 stars it's clear Cherry Blossom doesn't need my blessing to keep serving up delicious noodles, pasta, sushi, and whatever the hell else they feel like putting on their menu to their many fans.    I guess we'll start with the food, though that's not really why I'm writing this review. My go-to order is TanTan-Men which is actually kind of a problem considering I love it so much I rarely venture out from it and I'm sure there are other noodle dishes that are just as delicious that I am missing out on (feel bad for me). But, if you like spice, the TanTan-Men is the way to go. It will fill your stomach and clear your sinuses, and the order is HUGE. Definitely a two, or maybe even three, sitting meal. Which reminds me, once after dining in and barely denting my ginormous soup order, I proceeded to have a minor panic attack about how I was going to get this ramen equivalent of hoover dam into a to-go container without spilling it all over myself and causing a major scene. This panic attack proved to be completely unwarranted, since as soon as I said I wanted to take the rest home they took it and neatly packaged it FOR ME which was very nice and appreciated (I'm seriously not sure what I would have done if they brought me a container...cried, possibly).   This is the kind of service I'm writing this review about. Let me explain:  Every year since I've known him, my boyfriend hibernates from approximately January to June to study for an extremely difficult exam called the \"CFA\".  It's like the Bar except it's harder, it's about finance, and you have to take (and pass) a newer and harder level every year for three years to finally become a \"CFA\". This year the test was in June and of course, as soon as he was done with it we wanted to do something we hadn't been able to do for quite a while: a good old fashioned bar crawl.  This bar crawl went pretty long and at one point I remember playing the always appropriate song \"Stay Fly\" by Academy Award winning rap group Three Six Mafia on a jukebox at some dive bar whose name I can't even recall right now. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I can't find my wallet. I just KNEW I lost it on the bar crawl, and highly suspected it was during aforementioned jukebox session. I called every bar we visited to no avail and finally just came to terms with the fact that my cherry red Kate Spade wallet that I loved was gone forever. I bought a new wallet, got a new ID, new credit cards, all that fun stuff, and went on with my life.  Fast forward a couple months later. There's a package at my door. It's from Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. \"Hmm...I don't remember ordering takeout from Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe,\" I think, \"and if I did, sending it UPS is a very odd method of delivery\".  Then it dawned on me...what's my hangover food of choice after a good old fashioned bar crawl that ends with me playing inappropriate songs by Academy Award winning rap groups at bars whose name I can't recall? OMG NOODLES!!!!  Oh yes, I went to Cherry Blossom the next day for a hangover lunch, left my wallet there, and proceeded to completely block out the entire trip while trying to remember what bar I could have possibly left my wallet at the night before.  They got my address from my ID, packaged it up, paid the shipping, and MAILED IT TO ME. It was seriously one of the happiest days of my life. Any place that will go that much out of their way (Mind you, I never even CALLED them about the wallet. They had nothing to go on here.) to help a customer will never get less than 5 stars in my book though it doesn't hurt that their food is delicious, cures hangover, and packs itself up to go without you making a scene. Thank you, Cherry Blossom!",

The server came and took our order after roughly 10 minutes later. She didn't write down our orders, same as the other two tables before me and one after me. I was wondering: \"how can she remember all those orders if she doesn't even write them down? She must have a good memories.\" She was in such a hurry. I didn't finish my order and she tried to move on and asked my friend. I ordered Chasu ramen and I asked her if they have soft boiled egg, she said yes so I requested extra egg on my ramen, and I also ordered Green tea Milk; my friend ordered his Chicken Yakisoba and water with no lemons and no ice. The food came out in a very decent time, yet I did not get my egg on the ramen, my green tea milk became just Iced Green Tea and my friend's water came with ice and lemons. Seriously? So I called another waitress to fix my drink and my egg. The lady who took my order came later with a bowl of poached eggs with soup and she dumped everything in my bowl. Let me tell you, I thought all my appetite after seeing one poached egg got broken and one looking like fried egg in my bowl. It was so disgusting. If you're so busy with taking order, at least grab a notepad to write down all those orders, than had the orders wrong like 3 times. Other than the bad serving experience, the food tasted alright. The only thing I like the most was the green tea milk. It is well balanced between sweet and matcha flavor.",

However, I have visited it a few times again the past few months and it is still good.  I've enjoyed their happy hour a few times.  Its a great price for sushi rolls, sashimi, gyoza in spicy sauce/broth, and calamari.  I frequently get the Hiyashi Chuka.  The ramen is decent, as well as the chicken katsu.  They have good bread baskets and their banana bread is pretty delicious.",

The restaurant has gained popularity over the years and they really need to expand. The place is consistently crowded, even in the heat of summer, but with success has come some disappointments. The loud and rushed atmosphere has lead to less than spectacular service. The cooks also appear to get rushed and their dishes suffer. Take over the space next door and grow into the space that you deserve Cherry Blossom, your faithful customers are tired of waiting!",

The waitress came back and I order the katsu. The waitress asked if knew what it was. Well It's written on the menu In clear details( I knew what it was). I dont just pick some random food item. You can look at it as a kind gesture or as if she was irritated I told the manager I want to order.  The food came out separately for my friend and I. I waited while my friend started eating her dinner.    I am not happy with the customer service at all. The food is mediocre and not worth coming back!",

    "text": "On a whim I decided to recommend Cherryblossom to my boyfriend, who happens to love ramen and treated me to a fantastic noodle house in California once upon a time. Since then I've tried another place besides Cherryblossom in the Valley and have been told that Phoenix just doesn't have a good \"ramen scene.\" I'm glad I didn't give up my search before I remembered this place!   Other reviewers are right, this place is definitely buzzing with activity, and with only one cook and what appeared to be one server on a Sunday evening they were doing remarkably well. It did, however, take a little while for the waiter to see us once we were seated, and the table next to us complained about not being given menus. Part of that may have been due to the layout of the restaurant- we were in a side room that seemed cut off from the rest of the place.   Once our orders were placed the food arrived fairly quickly, and our drinks were delivered about the same time. To start we had gyoza, which arrived piping hot.   He had the Tan-Tan Men (spicy ramen,) and I had the Cha-shu (a more traditional-style ramen.) As usually happens when I dine out with my boyfriend, he chose the better dish. The broth was very flavorful and spicy enough to set his nose running, which according to him was one of the more important criteria... I can't really argue with that logic since I treat horshradish similarly.   My ramen dish was excellent, jealousy of my boyfriend's meal aside. The amount of pork in it was plentiful, and the noodles were soft and not too overcooked.  The atmosphere of this place is very friendly and inviting, it would be a great place to grab lunch on a not-so-busy day, but it was still enjoyable even with the wait. It lent itself well to casual conversation.   If you are a little impatient (or your date is) then it might be best to try somewhere a little less hectic. However if you don't mind sitting around a bit and chatting, I highly recommend checking out this local noodle house.",

I thought the noodles were kind of lacking.  The broth was decent, though kind of heavy with sesame.  The pork was flavorful and plentiful.

The beef was tender and full of wonderful flavor. The potato noodles were thin and delicious.The yakisoba tofu was slightly sweet, with a big portion and lots of well cooked tofu. It was awesome. Pad thai with chicken was simple but well done.  I definitely want to come back, especially for happy hour. I wish I hadn't taken so long to stop in!",

    "text": "So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)",

As I sat down, I realized I was sitting next to the biggest jerk/douche EVER!  He must have been on a date and I felt *really* sorry for the really pretty girl with the foreign accent sitting with him.  His cell rang AND HE ANSWERED IT!  In a restaurant!  his schnoz rivaled Seinfeld's.  He even got angry that their server came by and left because he was on the phone.  She told them it was policy not to disturb.  Fine enough!   Seriously, if I were sitting to eat next to him and not just waiting for take-out, I would have requested another table.  He bugged me THAT much. It didn't take more than 10 minutes for me to get my food.  Got home, it was still piping hot.  Generous portion of shrimp and TONS of crushed peanuts.  Yummy!  The sauce had a nice sweet/tang to it.  I saved half to eat later.  Or tomorrow, but it was so good, that I will probably eat it later tonight.  It was a little over $10 with tax.  Not bad for two meals!",

Dinner arrived and the server apologized that the sushi wasn't ready yet. About 20 minutes later after we had finished eating, and never got drink refills, didn't even get checked on we just kinda sat there at the table watching our server go to ever table except ours. Bringing every other table sushi except ours. Then I saw him twice go over to the main area and chit chat with his coworkers. Then he finally comes back over and just kinda stands there with a smile on his face and I said um I think I'll skip the sushi now. He tries to play it off like he had been asking the cooks for it. Whatev. He forgot. Then he brings us to go boxes and leaves for another 10 minutes. He walks by our table yet again and I had to stop him and ask him for the check. After he brings it to us we wait another damn ten minutes and I had to stop him again and say here can you please take this and I asked him if I could keep the receipt and he asks if he could cash out first. I said yeah sure only if you promise to come back. This time it only took him 2 minutes to come back.   Other than the horrible service the food was excellent. I only wish I was able to try the sushi.",

CB has sushi, salads, pasta (?), italian pasta for that matter, what else? a few thai, chinese, and one korean entree, and oh! like any other japanese joints, udon/saba/ramen and rice plates....prices range from $8 and up for everything...  interior has this contemporary, cozy, and a very inviting feel... which was a huge plus.  now, onto the food we go... we had a dragon roll ($9), which was eel, crab and cucumber... i wasn't quite thrilled with the unagi being cold... tasted as if it was taken right from the fridge... ahi salad and the rice platter we ordered were good, miso soup was funny... who puts sliced up cabbage in your miso? interesting... as much as i wanted to be adventurous and try italian pasta, i refrained from it from some odd reason. the tofu appetizer, which was also served as an entree was super yummy. the sauce was superly uberly yummy with perfection i could have easily mixed in the sauce with rice and be happy for me and more :D a must order ....  definitely a spot i would hit up for happy hours... good food, cheap prices, and friendly service...",

The table next to us (and I mean within 4 inches of us) was seated after us and received their drinks before anyone even bothered to say 'hi' to us.  The drinks took forever, as did the food, all while practically having my elbow in my neighbor's soup bowl.  I think I'd do this place to-go in the future.  Just not a good experience being surrounded by people and having none of those people being our waiter.",

It's interesting country French motif and variety of Asian and Italian specialities are brought to you by the fine folks who brought the Tokyo Express chain to the Valley. The Hakata ramen is pretty darn legit (tasty broth, decent chashu-style pork, and darn good noodles). I had the lunch ramen combo with my old fave, the inari-zushi. The bloom was off the rose, as it were, with the inari-zushi. It was not quite as sweet as it should be (maybe it's an off shipment from their supplier). Overall, the lunch special was good. Their happy hour is a very good value and I plan to return.",

The broth combined with seafood and vegetables is flavorful and delicious. The broth is not too spicy or heavy, just enough of both. This isn't a tradional cham-pon, but their version is absolutely delicious. I especially like this place for bringing Japanese ramen, Korean fusion, and overall Asian inspired dishes to Az.

The takoyaki came in a set of six and was topped with this oh-so-delicious brown sauce.  We followed that up with a wakame (seaweed) salad and an entree of salmon in cream sauce over pasta (not the exact name. it's on the last page of the menu near the bottom).  OH MAN! SUPER DELICIOUS!  Finished it off with a creme brulee, which surprisingly wasn't too rich.  Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking of it and it doesn't seem to matter that it's nearly 6am in the morning as I write this.  That alone should be a testament as to how rad the food at Cherry Blossom is.",

    "text": "This time the family went, because everyone wanted something different and  I said I'd be back to check out the menu. I felt that we'd get to try alot of other things this way. My daughter had Penne and spicy marinara, I had the Nagasaki Sara Udon and my partner had a Curry dish. We shared a dessert despite saying we wouldn't try one again. I got a pineapple cooler despite saying I wasn't going to try the drinks again. Listening to myself next time on both desserts and drinks. Promise. Food: The Penne Marinara was not spicy, but it was good said the daughter. It was $7 and the serving was plenty. She was ok with it. She lamented that we didn't pick Pizza a Metro again. I think I may have spoiled my ability to grab just any old pasta to suit her after eating there. My Nagasaki Udon had some good flavors, but there was a bit of burnt in it, sort of what happens some times at Panda Express with their noodles, but it was nice to have calamari and the shrimps. I added my sushi soy/wasabi sauce to it and the red pickled things from my partners curry dish and that livened it up. The sauce consistency was a bit ew at the end, so I didn't finish. The food was better than my previous visit. My partner did not enjoy the Curry, said it had no heat to it at all, was bland.  Nice service, though. We grabbed two sushi rolls for appetizer, one crunchy roll and a spicy yellow-tail. Both were fine, but again \"Spicy\" wasn't there. I think this place hedges itself on spice and for those that seek it, may feel disappointed.  Seating was difficult because they had a large party and I had to sit in a walkway in a door-frame on the edge and it was awkward. I upped my rating to a third star because our bread basket was tasty and because we were able to feed three diverse needs in one place, with better service this time.",

For here you can have a pretty high expectation on the food quality, but please do yourself a favor and don't have any expectations on the service (as otherwise you can be really disappointed). Their ramen is as good as what you will get across the ocean. But my favorite noodle is 'champon' which has seafood and veggies in a lighter broth (comparing to cha-su ramen). Despite it is a noodle cafe they have decent sushi too. And if you are here for lunch their lunch box is really filling and offers a variety of meat, veggies and rice etc. So basically their food consistently satisfy me. However, their service is not on par with their food. Even when they are not very busy, it takes a longer time to get taken care of. Although most of their waiters/waitress are helpful one waiter always serves with an attitude that make you think you owe him money or something lol and the host in front can ignore u for a while until she feels like seating you... Anyway I still suggest to try the place just for the food and you won't regret it!",

It was a little bit later than normal dining time, 9:45, so it was nice to be able to go and have a nice dinner that didn't involve waiting forever to be seated or fast food.    Once we were seated we were promptly ignored for quite a while.  Probably about ten minutes.  No one even came around to say they would be back in a couple minutes or that they were just busy at the moment.  Then the table next to us was seated, greeted, and got drinks all before anyone took notice of us.  Finally our grumpy server came by, said two words and then held up a finger, telling us to wait, while she talked to someone else.  Seriously?! WTF.    I ordered a water to drink and the Chicken Yakisoba.  I downed my water within 10 seconds of getting it and waited until the end of the meal to get it refilled.  Hmph.  The food was really yummy.  The noodles were firm and the sauce was light and kind of sweet.  I really liked the veggies included, but I thought the chicken was kind of unnecessary.  It just didn't add anything to the meal.   I think I will probably get some food from here again, but only in take out.  I'm not sure I could handle service like that again, especially since I can pretty much touch every end of the room when I stretch out my arms.",

I tried something else, but dont remember what it was called. It was basically shrimp tempura in rice with some kind of sweet honey type of sauce over it. It was pretty tasty. I also got a rainbow sushi roll that took a very long time for them to prepare. It came after we were all done eating. It was good, and the price for it was decent. The only complaint I had was that the fish was sliced to thick. It was a little on the chewy side.  Our waitress was kind of hit and miss, but she was a delight when she showed up.

I loved the ambiance. I loved that the meal doesn't start out with any old bread basket, but one with a delicious roll, yummy cinnamon-sugar toast, and excellent banana bread! Definitely a shocker, coming to a noodle place, but a pleasant surprise :)  The menu is broad and eclectic, ranging from Italian linguine to curry noodles, from ramen to sushi, and an impressive and surprising selection of rice dishes.  I had asian wheat noodles with chicken (I don't remember the name of the dish), and it was very tasty! While we were there, we heard another customer telling his friend that he's tried many things on the menu, and everything has been delicious. I believe it. They say a large part of taste comes from our sense of smell, and this place was just brimming with incredible aromas! I can't wait to go back and try more yummy dishes!",

The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!  The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.  Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu.  1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really? Salmon??? It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.    2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!  3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!  I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really??? in front of customers?  This place really cut corners in terms of food and service.   Benefit of doubt? Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.  Bottom-line, lazy effort at best. Worst case scenario, cheap food costing big bucks giving patrons food-poisoning from re-using left-overs!",

    "text": "We had dinner at Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe on a Thursday night about 7:30 pm.   The strip mall doesn't have any curb appeal and you're surrounded by Domino's, a Barber Shop and a drive-thru liquor store. We were quoted a 45 minute wait by an Asian woman who seemed less than pleased to see us. :( We waited an hour.  However, once seated, our server was pleasant and the menu options were more than we expected. Everything and anything with noodles, including Italian dishes?! The food was good and the atmosphere was cozy and full of obvious regulars.  One interesting(?) tidbit is the Kyoto Bowl next door is owned by the same people. We inquired after noticing there is an incomplete wall dividing the two restaurants.   We will visit again.  Hope my Yelp helped!",

The soup of its ramen is good but noodle is \"random\", which means you have 50% to get not well cooked noodles and rest for cooked ones based on my experience of four noodle dishes. The noodle was hard to bite and u can see the white texture raw part that haven't been boiled throughly. I have tried many different noodles from several countries in various levels of restaurants and I know what is good cooked noodle. Dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so. Tough texture and miss all good things in Japanese pastry( high quality cream, fine and smooth cake, no overdose sugar)  For the service. Cannot believe the male server is still there. I was astonished by his terrible service before and this time I was not disappointed. But by another server. Indifference and impatience are the words to describe them. The server neither explained the menu nor gave me any suggestion directly. I had to ask her several times for suggestion but did not get results.",

I don't know any other places that serves tarako (cod fish eggs) in Phoenix.   If this place is closer to my house, I would come here every week!  They also have a great selection of desert. I tried strawberry short cake. It was so moist and the cream was not too sweet, just right amount of sweetness made it so perfect and I ate all... May be it's a good thing that this place is not too close to my house. I may try their cake too often and I have to watch my girly figure if I do :).",

Sweat and sour pork was juicey and the tampura shrimp with brown rice was different I loved it!  On other occasions I have the suchi rolls which are all good, my favorite is the Rainbow roll.

Was supposed to have our last meal in AZ at Elote Cafe in Sedona for my birthday dinner but sadly couldn't wait till 5pm when they open so we headed to Phoenix. Of course I Yelped and found CherryBlossom. Was interested in the Japanese/Korean/Italian fusion.  Order 4 plates and banana bread:  BTW- our server who clearly has been there awhile was superb! Super sweet, tentative and took her time to make sure everything was perfect for us.   1. Baja Norte Roll - surprisingly fresh and lite to start as an app. Don't bother with the soy sauce bc the dipping sauce that came with it paired perfectly  2. TanTan Men - Chop chop was what the chopsticks did! Broth and spice level were perfect. If I wasn't sodium conscious, I would have slurped the whole bowl! 3. Spicy Korean beef with egg noodles - After trying my Tantan, I was expecting a lot of flavor in this dish. I was really bummed that the dish lacked any spice or taste. It was....bland! I told bf I was convinced they forgot some special seasoning :( 4. Bolognese - BF is obsessed with bolognese so decided to order it here although clearly this was an \"Asian\" restaurant.  Very lite in taste and didn't come with that strong spaghetti pow   Dessert - banana bread - very moist and good but I had better   No regrets coming here and would love to come back to try other dishes that look so yummy.",

I live so close that Yelp always lists this place when I search for a restaurant and although I have been here multiple times and placed to-go orders, I am always left with a \"much-to-be desired\" taste.   Since I am Asian, I do have my rice cravings from time to time and recently, I had to get some rice. So I placed an order here for Chicken Katsu and the Spicy Beef Noodles (with the recommendations from a few of you). I say to pass on the Chicken Katsu - they give you the sauce for it, but the sauce taste a little bitter to me. I think they add some type of mustard to it. So since I didn't like the sauce, I was left with the Chicken and the rice - and that combination just lacked any type of good flavor.   The Spicy Beef noodles did have flavor so I was happy about that. I was able to get full, but even after my meal, my thoughts of this establishment is \"eh, it was OK.\"  Two entrees = a little more than $20.",

I'm not accustomed to having deep fried veggies in my soup but I'll try anything once. It was very tasty broth and who doesn't love deep fried anything? The chicken was delicious and there was a generous amount of everything in this medium sized bowl. My only complaint would be the spoon which I found impossible to fit in my mouth and therefore dribbled my broth with every bite. Good thing I was eating alone.

The order is always fresh and the miso soup that comes with(dine in only) is pretty good. The cha-shu is pretty good but the broth doesn't necessarily feel completely authentic. Now the yakisoba noodles are a hit or miss. What I mean is that they over cook the food and leave a overwhelming burnt taste to the dish about 50% of the time. Can't really say I would recommend it. The complimentary bread is cold and bland. The service is what makes this place a 3 and not a 4. Either the staff is rude, forget important parts of the meal(eating utensils), disorganized, or a combination. They are not fans of refunds or remaking dishes.

    "text": "It was my first time at cherry blossom noodle cafe and it was definitely a good experience. The environment was quaint (I didn't notice the pictures on the walls until a little later). We were seated in what I felt was a little bit of an awkward spot where people were entering into the dining area.  We started out with drinks and I definitely liked the strawberry punch and the mango tango sake floats. The bread basket was definitely amazing (we ended up ordering two :) ). We also ordered the crispy calamari, pan fried gyoza, the ebi chili (upon waitress recommendation) and the shimeji mushroom and bay scallops pasta. The best was definitely the pasta and pan fried gyoza. Cherry blossom noodle cafe has a well deserved reputation for having amazing noodles. Our least favorite was the ebi chili. We thought that for 6 dollars the ebi chili was not as good as it should have been (especially if an employee recommended it). The sauce tasted almost like ketchup and the ebi itself was bland. The waitress did disappear for a little bit and it took longer for our pasta to come out because of a \"mix up\". Overall a good food experience (still craving the bread).",

I'm going to get stuck on the spicy beef I know it.   The pasta is so good. I'm dying to try the Italian aspect as well. Give this place a shot. Totally worth it.",

    "text": "I've had a difficult time finding tasty ramen place but this is a good cafe to satisfy a craving. I've heard great things about the ramen here and I would go back again.   The service & Restaurant  Our wait time wasn't long at all and our waitress was kind and helpful. Our drinks were kept full and plates cleared right when we were done. The restaurant itself kind of caught me off guard but not in a negative way. Right when you walk in there's baked goods and a desert case with a wide variety of things that look great! The menu itself has what you would expect to find from a noodle house. However, they also have one page in their menu dedicated to Italian food which I found pretty odd.   The food To start we ordered the spicy salmon roll on happy hour. What I liked about it was that it was cut chunks of tuna instead of the usual  pate texture. Other than that I would give the roll a 2 out of 5 and wouldn't ever pay more than the $3.50 it cost. But honestly I can't complain because you don't order sushi from a ramen house. For ramen, I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. It came in a huge, steaming bowl and it smelled great. The miso based broth was pretty good! It was better than most I've tried and the pork belly was cooked really well. Most restaurants will just put a hard boiled egg in as the last step in making it but they cooked the egg in the broth which made it taste even better.   Overall I would come back again but I recommend that people who are new to ramen get a feel for what they like and be open minded. The restaurant has multiple kinds of broth and I only like one of them so it's no surprise if you end up not liking one. I would try a baked good too because they look great!",

We got there at 2.20 (tried to get the lunch special which ends at 2.30), the hostess set us in the other room, but they didn't really pay attention to that room and the server didn't get to us until 2.40, so that means we weren't able to get the lunch special...  We ordered Cha-Shu Ramen, Spicy Salmon Roll and Tempura Shrimp Roll. The food came to us pretty quickly, the Ramen is pretty damn good, the Spicy Salmon Roll wasn't as spicy as I expected, and the Tempura roll wasn't tightly rolled and it fell apart when trying to dip it in the soysauce. But other than those, the flavor was still pretty good.  But then came the main problem. After we got the food, the server came in and checked on us 5 minutes later... After we said it was good, we sat and ate for another 20 minutes. We were done eating but no one was coming in to check on us to see if we wanted anything else, like a new glass of water. My boyfriend ended up having to go to the hostess himself and ask for the take out box and bill. After he asked, they said yes, it will be just a second.... It ended up being almost another 20 minutes... We ended up being there for over an hour because of the slow service.  So I'm not sure if I would come back here because my bf was unhappy about the slow service. It's like they kinda forgot that there were people in the room they put us in.",

I love the Ramen here for sure :). Another Favorite you shoud try is the Mango Tango cocktail as well as the Strawberry punch cocktail. The lemonade here is delici and so the cocktails have their lemonade and it is to die for! Gyoza here is very good as well. Much better than other Gyoza I have tried before. Sushi is yummy too and my personal fav is Double Crunchy roll and my husband's is the Philly roll. Price is good, not cheap but not too pricy like most places.   Now.. about the restaurant and staff.. it is a Very small joint with limited space and  long wait times at times. Dark and almost romantic with dim lighting we really like that.... and staff always seems in a hurry... we have been here atleast 20 times and every single time we come the hostesses are rude to us(when we always try to be nice we do not like trouble)... there is one server who is always rude to us as well but we never complain just wanted to let it out on here... he wears glasses. Just personal experience. But the food is delicious.  We hust always experience bad service but that will not stop us from coming here for a meal.",

The soup was supposed to be spicy and I asked for extra spicy but it was not at all. It was not flavorful. The portions were huge and everyone has plenty to eat but it's not somewhere I'd return to.   My favorite bite of the night was the tempura jalapenos. They were great!    If you're eating.

I've been twice now outside of happy hour (once for dinner, once for lunch) and both the service and the food have been average to below average. Most recently for lunch, I came with a party of 5 from work before the lunch rush. We were seated in the back room where the lights were still off (see: pre-lunch rush) and got our orders in. As the back room filled in, we received our food in a very large scattering - a few people got their California rolls that came with the lunch specials first as well as an appetizer, then an entree a few minutes later, a sushi lunch combo a few minutes after that, 2 noodle bowls after that, and then an assurance from the waitress that a coworker's sushi roll would be out shortly. 5 minutes pass and everybody else in the room has their food apart from my one coworker - the waitress says it'll be out in 3 minutes. Those 3 minutes pass by and our table is done with all of the food when the waitress comes once more and says the sushi roll is being made now. Unfortunately we were out of time and our coworker was left unimpressed.  As for the food, I do like the happy hour menu - good bites with good flavor and prices. I most recently had the hakata ramen lunch combo and felt that the ramen was pretty bland and overall left me feeling pretty unsatisfied. Overall, I'd say Cherry Blossom now reminds me of a pan-Asian version of the Cheesecake Factory - good for a wide range of tastes, but there's better out there if you look for it.",

I even found scallop inside which was perfectly not over cooked. The egg inside is also taste good. The restroom is not that clean which might trouble customers some. In all, it's a nice spot.

We were hoping to have a new go-to ramen joint but I'm afraid that we're going to have to keep looking... It wasn't that the food was awful or the service was dreadful, it just wasn't anything that impressed us at all. We ordered the Korean spicy beef and the chicken yakisoba, both were good enough to fill us up , but neither of us were blown away or even excited to come back and try anything else. Normally we will come up with a game plan to try something different on the menu, or come at a different time if we see potential at a restaurant. That's not the case here for us. People eating around us seemed to enjoy it, so it may not be our cup of tea. Sigh.",

The staff has always been super nice, the food has always been FANTASTIC, and honestly, I could not recommend this place highly enough.  I've tried just about everything on the menu, and so far there hasn't been anything I DON'T enjoy. Even their Italian dishes are surprisingly good (my favorite is the chicken marsala).  Great food at a fairly good value, ESPECIALLY if you go when they have their lunch specials going on.",

I love getting their katsu-don and add extra sauce. Today we qne for something different.  Vegi-Ten Udon is great besides the soggy tempura, but I think that can be solved if I asked for them to separate it. I think having the tempura in the bowl gave it a good presentation but definitely they got soggy way too fast.  Beef Curry Udon was delicious but a bit too salty for my personal taste. It was a great idea to add a poached egg to get a creamy curry consistency.  Mixed Tempura Dinner is basically a Bento box. Delicious and crispy. The miso soup was definitely a bit too salty as well. We had leftovers in the end of our lunch.  I can't wait to try something else next time I visit. Hopefully it won't be as salty.",

Udon was second on that list behind pie.  I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon and some random sushi roll.  The sushi wasn't memorable, the rice was a little crisper than I care for in a sushi roll.  The Udon was amazing however.  Usually when I order Udon I can't finish the whole bowl, it's always so much food.  The Nabeyaki was so good I happily enjoyed the pain from over eating.    Thanks to Cherry Blossom and the Pie Hole my list of foods I need to stay happily downtown is complete.",

I had the pork katsu curry and it gave me flash backs of my last trip to Japan. My wife had the ramen and loved it.

They have a fantastic happy hour menu too!

I was not totally happy with the service my waiter provided. Not once did he stop by to ask if my food turned out ok or if I need anything else.   When I finished my meal, he asked if I wanted dessert, so I asked what they have, he pointed a few items out in the display case and walked away. I had decided to try one of them, but instead of asking what I have decided for dessert, he came back with the check.   I was turned off by his lack of service, and decided not to get the dessert and just pay and leave.  There are so many items on the menu, it was hard to pick. So, I think I will give it another try. But probably will make sure I am not seated to the same waiter again.",

The ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.

Seriously, I don't get the fuss about this place, unless everyone is having udon/ramen/sushi and I don't know about it....  The service is good. The ambiance is nice. The food is average.  The menu is a strange fusion combination, but I applaud their efforts at trying to meld such different cuisines (Japanese, Italian fusion).  I want to give this place three stars because I do enjoy the ambiance, but the Thai Salad was so amazingly bad and bland that I can't bring myself to add that extra star.",

They start you with some warm bread, which was nice because we were so hungry. Our ramen came within minutes, and it was good. We really liked their chashu, and my boyfriend drank just about every drop of his soup. Basically we were in and out pretty quick, happy and full! We'll be back so I can try some of their Italian pastas!",

The menu is somewhat distinct in that it provides Asian selections as well as Italian pastas. I started with some very tasty spring rolls and went in the Italian direction for my entree. I ordered the spaghetti with olive oil and grilled chicken. Except for the bland, unseasoned chicken the dish was quite flavorful with a bit of kick provided by crushed red pepper.  The server accidently knocked my glass of water over in my direction but he cleaned it up quickly and was very embarrassed about his mistake. Overall the service was great and I expect I will return soon to try the Tempura, which comes highly recommended. I dig the wooden floors too.",

I had the yakisoba (noodles with vegetable and sauce), my brother had the Udon noodle soup with tofu, and his friend has the tuna.  All three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful.  We couldn't stop raving about the flavor.  Who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful?!?  The service was actually quite wonderful.  Our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like.  She also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket...banana bread, little cinnamon toasts, and rolls.  She also helped up each pick a desert :)  Just an odd little place, Japanese and Italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an Eiffel Tower decoration and a bright red British phone booth???  Check it out :)",

For lunch you can be out in an hour, but you will have to keep on top of the server for your check and then begg them to take payment! They slack big time in this sense, not sure why.   But the food is always fresh and very delicious, not to mention very affordable. I love the sushi, although not a big variety, they always have fresh stuff and very tasty. I have a few favorite rolls and love the penne al arrabiatta. I used to make homemade arrabiatta all the time, but haven't in years because theirs tastes soooooo yummmy! This place is great for dates, long converstaions and those who need to stretch their time together. Everything is wonderful and you will be pleasantly surprised with the beautiful decor in a strip mall..... you'll feel like you have entered another land, once you walk thru thems doors, because its so cute and quaint, not what you'd expect. Go try this place you'll love it!!!",

The soup was so hot I had to take a break for 5 minutes. That's a good thing though.   The ladle... I wasn't sure how to use a ladle, so I stuck with chopsticks, and slurped some soup directly from the bowl. I felt so primative, that I couldn't/ wouldn't do that again. I probably should've asked for a soup spoon..   I will try this place again very soon w/o my time constraints. I had to rush home to kill nazi zombies.

We totally expected a place similar to Spoon House in Torrence, CA but it is more Italian than Japanese atmosphere wise.  The banana bread was not as good as everyone raved to be but it was good.    We first tried the tataki and a salmon roll.  Tataki was beautifully presented on the plate and both tasted pretty good.  Hiyashi Chuka was ok...not my fav and the portion was pretty small.  Champon was full of seafood and thick noodles which was a total plus :)    The dessert...oh my, that was the best part of dinner...well, at least to me.  My bf's fav was the tiramisu.  I tried the flan and it was GREAT.  It's kinda hard to explain but it was like a mix of custard and cheesecake with a sauce that has a hint of bitterness to go with the sweet fran.  I was lucky enough to get the last piece of the night...you must try it if they have it available.  Oh and our waitress was really really nice.  She likes yelp too so we discussed how great this website is haha*  *Atmosphere = cute, lovely *Food = good.  if you like both Italian and Japanese, this place has it all. *Service = very nice.   *Price = great*  a blended drink + one appetizer + one roll + 2 entree + 2 desserts = check turned out to be around $60!",

But you order whatever on the menu, and it's great! We tried A LOT of dishes and all were very good!  The green tea with milk is very yummy! Kinda like Thai tea but green tea. I don't remember what it's called but they had this fried chicken that you dipped in some soy/ mustard sauce and was fantastic!!  I'm super picky about sushi being I'm from New Orleans and am spoiled to fresh fish. ALSO! I haven't found the Crunchy roll anywhere outside of New Orleans and found it here. SO EXCITED!

The calamari salad is good after the first few bites, but the pieces of squid are huge and overly battered. The portion is huge, but you are left not wanting to eat the entire thing. The little scallop pasta appetizer was pretty good, and so is the bread they served complimentary when you are there at dinner (not happy hour). The sushi is about par with the grocery stores. Desserts look good in the dessert case, but I've never tried any. My biggest gripe is the terribly slow service! I've been there twice. Once on a Saturday around 3:30pm, once on a Friday night at 5:30pm. Both times, it took over 40-45 minutes to get our food. The last time I went, which will also be the last time I go, we waited close to 45 minutes and when I inquired with a waiter, he threw his hands up and in a joking tone,and said \"it's happy hour, there's always a wait.\" He didn't bother to check on the status of our food. His attitude was, \"Hey, we've got more business than we can handle...suck it up!\"  If you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest!",

The interior is homey, and comes off as a cross between a sushi bar and an italian bistro in terms of decor.  The first thing I ordered was the Nabeyaki Udon (in the iron pot), and I was blown away. The noodles they use are excellent, and they make their own broth (which, I was told, was simmered with seaweed--it certainly was addictive and delicious!) Since then I have been back many times, and the quality remains consistent.   I've also never had a problem with the wait staff, and one japanese lady whose name escapes me is a total sweetheart. She accidentally brought me \"the big boss's\" pint glass instead of the standard happy hour $2.80 glass, and apologized (I did get to keep it, so I'm not sure why!).  Their sushi is mediocre, but far from terrible. I suggest trying some of the more difficult to find items on their menu, like their delicious udon or (my favorite) the Kake Soba (buckwheat noodles in broth with spinach and spring onions).  The italian stuff scares me a little bit, although I'm sure it's fine. Maybe I'll try it some day. Itadakimasu!",

The prices are reasonable, approx $10 per person, maybe a little more if you order drinks and/or dessert.",

All we knew was that I wanted sushi and that we wanted something awesome! After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC...   \"So where is this place?\" \"ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel\" \"Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?\" \"I unno\" \"What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!\" \"Ummm... no.\" \"oh HELL to the no!\" *the car then becomes filled with laughter*  We passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's Pizza and headed to the cafe of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute wait. We were then outside and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated.  Our waitress was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The fresh  thick lemon wedge and fresh sprig of mint in the water pitchers. The way the servers are so friendly. She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand times.   She helped us order sushi. I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested crispy rolls and alaskan rolls. They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the flavor. With the soy sauce was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our orders and just get more sushi! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had sushi before liked it.   After devouring the sushi our food came. I ordered the beef soba noodle soup with tempura. It came with chicken instead. (boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba noodles, I usually get udon or chinese noodles. but I really liked the flavor and the fresh spniach that was wilting more and more as time went on. The slight flavor of the sliced green onions really made the dish something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(  One queen devoured the beef yakisoba noodles at once! I was able to sneak my chopsticks inbetween his bites and I got a taste. it was CRAZY yummy! each of the veggies had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it.   The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the taste of his Spicy beef rice plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome.   We then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! Talking to our waitress about the Navajo sushi chef behind the sushi bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said chef never made it to our table - and it's just as well... we were in food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this place now and am VOWING to take several people with me next time! :)",

    "text": "I was fooled.  The unassuming strip mall exterior and the fact that it shares a wall partition with a blech sister restaurant (Tokyo Express) had me fooled.  Even the overwhelmingly positive reviews didn't inspire me to go.  But make no mistake, this place is fantastic.   I am embarrassed to say that I only ended up here because Lola and Padres (Oregano's was too long of a wait) were both closed on Sunday night -- and I pass by this place all the time.  Really good noodles and pasta done Asian Fusion style and totally cheap.  The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that's not your thang, they have rice bowls, sushi, salads, about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.  You'll find that they have an open kitchen so if you're close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else's food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it.   My favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?  Wtf, whew, that came out of left field.  An awesome and delicious surprise that was.  They had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special.  Did you hear that?  HALF OFF!!  All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes, it's official.  I'm easy.  When I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.  Only then, did everything in life make sense.  Lesson:  Sketchy looking strip mall restaurant does not equal dump.   P.S.  The tiny parking lot gets crowded very quickly and street parking with Oregano's next door can be problematic.",

    "text": "I love good ramen.  I fell in love with ramen at Santouka Ramen in San Diego and Los Angeles.  When I heard about Cherry Blossom I was hoping to finally have a place to go to in Phoenix that would give me my ramen fix without having to drive to California.  My wife and I visited Cherry Blossom and I was disappointed in their lack of selection for ramen.  Cherry Blossom serves asian dishes of all sorts and even Italian dishes.  It is a very odd concept to me but it all revolves around noodles.  They have five choices for ramen.  I'm used to getting pork miso ramen at other ramen houses.  Cherry Blossom didn't exactly have that. They had miso ramen with salmon slices.  I relented and got the miso ramen with salmon slices.  When I was served I was immediately encouraged by the color of the broth which was a light brown and not transparent, just as it should be.  I could tell there was less oil in this ramen broth than at Santouka.  The broth was pretty good, but a hair on the salty side.  Don't get me wrong, I expect the broth to be very high in sodium and cause me to gain several pounds of water weight, but this was saltier than I am used to.  The fish was done properly but I hadn't looked forward to that as much as the noodles.  The noodles weren't bad.  The noodles were good but not quite the quality as places I visited in California and Las Vegas.  I expected to have more vegetables and/or seaweed in the dish.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my dish and it was priced appropriately at $8.60 plus tax, but it didn't wow me.  If you compare Cherry Blossom to Republic Ramen in Tempe, AZ, Cherry Blossom wins hands down.  The noodles and broth have so much going on and is far superior to Republic Ramen.        Cherry Blossom has Japanese beer on tap and good house saki.  Both were reasonably priced.  The cocktail recipes didn't appeal to me at all.  I have been to Japanese bars before and they had some complex recipes that showed allot of thought and passion for bar tending at those other places but these Cherry Blossom recipes looked uninspired and like they were written by someone that wasn't used to making cocktails professionally.          All in all, I would go to Cherry Blossom if it is near you or if you are just dying to get your ramen fix and you don't have a lot of options living in Phoenix but I prefer other ramen houses I have been to in Vegas and California much more than Cherry Blossom.",

With little options for a great dining experience with delicious food, it's great that this place exists. Traditional Japanese ramen, Yakisoba and udon dishes. Great sushi rolls and more. And if Japanese is not your thing, then try their Italian dishes. This is a noodle shop, so of course you can't leave out Italian dishes. Their customer service is excellent too!",

I'm down with the fusion, only if it's done tastefully. I mean, after all, you are there for the taste.   Seared tuna... was far from seared. They just let the flimsy slivers of tuna saturate in the acid for a bit to give it a seared look. But uh, it was missing the crisp in the sear, and all I could taste was the acidity and pepper sprinkled on top.  Takoyaki... supposedly had some octopus bits in it. Luckily, I found 1/4 of a tentacle in these things. However, this was sabotaged by the sauce these little balls were drowning in. Too much basil in the hoisin or something.  The caterpillar... haha. Cute, but was searching for some significant pieces of eel in here. Sushi rice was a bit soggy too.   Ebi-ten, basically udon/soba (opted udon) with two shrimp tempura, was okay. I've whipped this up myself before, so...  Wow, unfortunately not very memorable. Good job, presentation... but not so much a sensation.",

This onetime experience won't stop me from coming back to give the Cafe another chance...as I think I might have been transported to a parallel universe for this meal.   First off... cute little place, there is no doubt that this is not a chain. The interior of the restaurant is simple and looks more like your dining at an authentic Asian bistro in Vancouver rather then in a central Phoenix strip mall. Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked.   I ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a \"bonus\" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I'll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate...   so when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff.   When my \"shrimp\" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste...   My friend's pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...  The strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.",

The meal also came with miso soup and bread.  The only complaint with this restaurant is our server wasn't that great and overall service was really slow. If you're on an hour lunch break from work, this place probably isn't the best unless you work around the corner.   Otherwise, I would totally come back!",

I also tend to go for Asian noodles when I'm out since I'm so picky about Italian anyplace but home. I saw on the menu that they offered low-carb tofu noodles and got it with the chicken parmesan. Also tasted some of the ramen and had some calamari. Everything was excellent including our server and it really hit the spot after going a while without any kind of pasta/noodle. I think I'll start making them a more regular stop.",

Another go-to dish would have to be the Tan Tan Men and Cha Sieu Ramen. Hands down delicious. I miss the cinnamon toast bread that used to come in the baskets, but their regular bread is like a warm pillow. That's the best way to describe it. The chicken katsu is another winner as well. Each time I come I always have to add at least one sushi roll to compliment my meal and satisfy all of my cravings. I miss living down the street from here!

I always tell everyone that Its some of the best sushi, saki clams, gyosa pot, ramen and Italian noodle dishes. No one believes me till we take them and then their hooked. Trust me, it's worth a try.   My go to is the tan tan men or the chashu. The hot pot is great as well or the Katsu bowl.   The girlfriend loves their chicken Marsala and the chicken park is good too.   If you want rolls you have to get there early but they are great. Plus their wine is great as well as their saki.   Cherry blossom is one of the best kept secrets in Arizona and can't go wrong no matter what you get.",

    "text": "Why do people come here for such bad service? It is such a mystery to me.  It is always the same bad service. Yes, the food is good but the service is just awful. You would think they would get it together by now. Weird they place is always packed maybe people do not care that they are treated so badly? I have eaten here many times and it is always the same. I think I'm done with this place.   Update for 12/31/15 and 1/1/16  Early in day NYE Me- on Phone- \"Hi are you open tomorrow on the holiday? I have out of town guests who want to revisit your place.\" Man who answered phone- I don't know. ( really?) hold on (Does not put me on hold and screams in my ear and across the restaurant apparently to get an answer) \" Yes, we are open.\" Dead air space continues.  Me- \"Ummmm, are you sure? What time?\" Man- Repeat of above scene. By now I am deaf and wanting to drive down to show him where the hold button is located on a phone set.   Me- \"Anything special going on?\" Man- No. End call.   I call back and reconfirm they are open. Nothing is said about needing a reservation or a special menu either time.   Fast forward to 10pm-strangely my phone rings and the number is not one I recognize. i call back and it is Noodle Cafe   Me- Umm you called me? Are you calling to tell me you are closed. ( I never left my phone number. I thought maybe they were just using Caller Id. )  Lady- No, who is this? Me- Well someone called and I was just wanting to make sure you are still open tomorrow. lady- I can't imagine who would have called you. ( three seconds later) Me- in my mind I am thinking it is probably a phone glitch.\" Are you calling me back from your Caller Ids from the day?  Lady- No, do you have a reservation for tomorrow? Is that why you are calling?  Me- Sighs loudly. \"No you called me. Do I need a reservation for tomorrow? I have never had one here before and we are coming in around noon.   Lady- No Me- Are you sure you are open? ( Skeptical) lady -Yes see you tomorrow.   Okay, you see where this is going right? Fast forward to New Year's Day. I enter the restaurant and see a sign for their special menu.  Ummm, what special menu?  Me- Hi we are a party of five for noon. I am a bit early. May you put down my name?  Lady- Do you have a reservation Me- No Lady- Sorry we are having a New Year's special and you need a reservation.   I am a most forgiving person with these things but every single time i visit this eatery there is an issue.  When everyone arrived We left and went to Grassroots, which was fabulous by the way! I will not be returning any time soon to Noodle Cafe, if at all.",

    "text": "Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe came highly recommended by several Yelp friends, so maybe my expectations were too high or I ordered the wrong thing. Nonetheless, I left not all that impressed with the food.   The service was good and the restaurant was clean. I just wouldn't drive across town in Phoenix to visit again.   The vegetable tempura was not all that tasty, and some pieces were over fried leaving them hard and crunchy rather than light and crispy. Sadly, the sauce for the tempura was also flavorless.   I had the Grilled Tuna over Rice which came with a side salad and miso soup. I ate the soup and salad, took one bite of the tuna and left the tuna and rice behind. I love taking home leftovers so you know it was a sad dining experience when I leave a whole plate of food behind!  Oh, well! I had a fun time at the restaurant with some of my favorite Yelpers and got to meet Nadine who was visiting all the way from Hawaii.   I suggest trying some of the other offerings at the restaurant. I think the mixed reviews for the restaurant has to do with the mixed quality in the dishes. Hopefully the restaurant will revamp some of their dishes so we all leave happy. :)",

Our group of friends ordered various items:  Miso Ramen: This was probably the best dish out of everything, but not up to bay area ramen standards  Yakiniku: This was the most disappointing dish of the night. Dry pieces of beef sauteed with some veggies. Meh at best.  Korean Spicy beef with noodles: If you've ever had Mongolian beef with noodles from a mall food court, you get this Korean Spicy Beef dish.  I must say, however, that the waitstaff was very attentive and got our food fairly quickly, so +1 to them for that. Otherwise, this place is all hype.",

Udon noodles (with just the right chew) in a beautiful broth with spinach and green onions and 3 pieces of shrimp tempura.  Some of the best crunchy California rolls we've ever eaten.

I believe his name was Andrew. He took his time explaining every little thing to me. When he noticed I didn't eat my food he took it off the bill without me asking.

I've been to different places that serves ramen and sushi and this one serves delicious one too! I ordered their shoyu ramen with california crunchy roll and green tea milk as my drink.  All were served timely, I just waited a little to 5 minutes for the sushi and ramen to be served. I personally don't have any idea how the ramen is made but this one that thick deliciously flavored broth that according to my research, having that delicious broth you must simmer the pork/beef bones for hours to get the flavor that you wanted. And you must also have the correct ingredients so that you can have the best result you wanted. My sushi was also freshly made and tasted heavenly flavorful. I am well filled during the visit and I am sure to be back here and gain more weight. Thumbs up.",

I went in for a simple dinner with my boyfriend and we ordered the cha-shu (ramen with bbq pork), yakiniku (korean sliced beef), and crispy calamari with wasabi mayo sauce.   I've been to a lot of ramen restaurants, and for a lot of them, I wasn't really too impressed. With Cherryblossom, they have the right saltiness in their broth that wouldn't really warrant me to drink two glasses of water after eating it.  As for the korean beef, it was pretty good as well! For the price though, I don't think the serving was that much. Lastly, the calamari was one of my favorites. The wasabi mayo was a great touch!   Their employees are super friendly too, so that was definitely a plus!",

Have tried a few other things like their yakisoba and a few sushi rolls but still loving this bowl the most !!",

Primavera Pasta: Japanese-style Italian pasta is definitely a league of its own. They cook it in a way where the starchiness of the noodles help to enhance the entire dish, and each bite is full of flavor. This was a great vegetarian dish with various vegetables (eggplant, tomatoes, onions, and bellpeppers), and while a lot of vegetarian dishes fall flat on flavor, this definitely does not! Highly recommend this!  Hot Sansai Udon: Solid Udon with your classic sansai veggies. The udon noodles are from vacuumed sealed udon noodles, but the broth was flavorful with a generous amount of veggies. For a udon place in Phoenix, AZ, I didn't think I would fine sansai udon, and I am pleased.",

Perfect when you want pork belly but want something lighter than ramen. The tuna don was not super exciting and I was expecting slices of fish not cubed.",

Will have this one again... it was so good that I forgot to take a picture. We also had the calamari,  but it was over cooked and chewy  . Then we had the Tori Nanban, the broth was good as was the noodles. The letdown here was thechicken...  its was very tough and dry. . Last we had the chicken Katzu, and it was delish, tender and juicy!!  I am always looking for good Japanese food.  This was ok worth trying it. For me still searching.",

    "text": "With all the hype surrounding Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe, maybe I went in with unrealistic expectations and well, it fell flat. We waited about 25 minutes for a table and in the cramped little restaurant, constantly felt in the way of the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. The food looked good, and the menu was varied - you have ramen, udon, rice, and even pasta but when it came down to it, it was just okay.  The service was alright, the space a little cramped, and the food, just alright. I had the beef curry udon which I had hoped was udon in curry but it was udon, in broth, with a scoop of beef curry up top. When you're expecting a thick bowl of curry, this was rather underwhelming. The tantan men was spicy, which was what I was hoping for, but the noodles weren't anything special, a little reminiscent of my college staple - cup ramen. We even ordered the pork belly appetizer, which was just five little pieces, not quite melt in your mouth or tasty, as I had hoped.  With thousands of reviews and a 4.5 star rating, maybe I'm way off base, walking in with unrealistic expectations but I don't think I'll be stopping by here of my own accord anytime soon. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did.",

    "text": "This review has long been forthcoming.  We've eaten at Cherryblossom countless times now, but neglected to post a review of this marvelous place.  Tucked in a small strip mall, just east of 7th street on Camelback Road, is this gem of an eatery.  It bills itself as featuring mouth-watering dishes from all over the world. That's a bit of a stretch, but their current offerings are wonderful.  During this particular visit, my wife had the Pork Katsudon.  I had the Chasu with Egg.  Both dishes were a marvel to the eyes, and even better to our palates. The flavors were distinctive, but not too overwhelmingly spicy. Too much spice can often be used to mask the inherent lack of True flavor of the dish or the meats. Not so here at Cherryblossom.  The Miso soup was the only underwhelming aspect of our current visit. It was about as bland as I could've gotten next door at Tokyo Express.  We like the decor of this place. It's cozy, comfortable, inviting, and the lighting is subdued, but not too dark.   The spacing between tables are a little bit tight, and loud conversationalists can easily overwhelm your own quiet conversation. However, this should not detract from the overall experience of this establishment.",

The staff is friendly but they can be a bit slow. We waited almost 20 minutes for the check before we decided to just walk up to the cashier. The restaurant can be busy at times so it's understandable.   We ordered the vege-ten udon, beef curry udon, and mixed tempura dinner. Both udon bowls were delicious with generous portions. The tempura dinner was served with miso soup which was a bit on the salty side. The tempura itself was great; again the portions are very big . I enjoyed the tempura dinner and would order it again.   Overall We had a pleasant experience here. The food was great. Hopefully next time the service  will be better. I would recommend checking this place out when it's not as packed.",

I got the ramen combo with California rolls for $11.  The ramen was a good portion but very bland.  The California rolls were decent.  Overall, it was still a good deal.  My husband has the beef udon bowl for $11 and that bowl was so tiny and bland.  Definitely not worth it.  I guess we won't be back for another while.",

    "text": "Original review 6/10/2013 was 2 stars Today 7/14/2017 I'm editing and making it five stars.  Yes. the customer service was bad, but I'm willing to go back for the food.   The truth is that it is amazing they take the time to make something that is traditional and time-consuming. True ramen is not the crunchy stuff in the plastic rapper and the real thing is found in only a few places in the valley.  I have made TONKATSU ramen and the egg based ramen noodles from scratch myself many times. I have also gone out of my way to try ramen from any place I could find it.   I went back to Cherryblossom again and again because I think their ramen is the only one which tastes authentic and is priced very well for the large bowl you recieve. I even told them my family member needed gluten free and the accommodated us by using their tasty broth with flat rice noodles as a substitute. I tasted mine and the one done with rice noodles and they were both great!  Unfortunately I have not been back in a few years because of the unfortunate incidents listed below in my original review but I am ready to go and give it another try!   Original Review with added notes: The RAMEN is excellent.  The owners are sweet and the ambiance is pleasant.  I gave it a low rating for the customer service. My first visit I was seated in the back and had to wait for service a lot, for long periods of time.  I didn't mind due to the gracious hospitality. (ADDED NOTE: THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT CONSIDERING I TOOK MY WHOLE FAMILY WHICH MADE US A PARTY OF SEVEN. WE ORDERED LIKE 4 SOUPS AND 1 SUSHI PLATE WHICH FILLED EVERYONE UP. WE ALL LEFT HAPPY AND OUR SERVER WAS NICE. SHE EVEN HAD A HELPER WITH HER.)  My second visit, was terrible. They saw me walk in and didn't offer me a menu or greet me. A second customer walked in after me and they helped that person first, instead of me.  Finally someone asked if I had a question. I said no, I'm waiting for a menu. He turned to the hostess and said \"oh, why did you tell me she had a question?\" and then he just walked away leaving me to wait longer.  (ONE ADDED NOTE: I had applied for a job some time before so maybe the woman thought I had just come in to check on the job but this does NOT explain why things did not improve once I told them I was actually there as a customer. NO THEY WERE NOT BUSY)  When I finally got a waiter, I already knew what I wanted, I didn't waste the waiters time. I waited a LONG (TIME) for my food until I ran out of time to eat it. THE WAITER DIDN'T CHECK ON ME AGAIN UNTIL I STOOD UP TO LEAVE. He had the nerve to ask if I needed anything. I told him I ran out of time to eat and had to leave. He didn't apologize, he just put the check on the table and left again.   I do not know if this is a place where you have to wait for them to come grab the check or if you are supposed to take it up to the hostess but he never came back so I took it up to the hostess. She just stood there, IN FRONT OF ME, drying wet cups.  I was just there for a lunch break soup. Why did it take an hour? (ADDED NOTE: I HAVE GONE BACK 1 TIME FOR TAKE OUT AND SOMEONE PICKED UP RAMEN FOR ME 1 TIME AS TAKE OUT BEFORE I STOPPED GOING FOR GOOD.)",

I really want to try their Italian dishes but have always been hesitant since they are considered a Japanese restaurant, but after seeing some of the pictures on here, they definitely look worth trying.  Their daily special bento boxes are always great, too, and are inexpensive.  It's definitely a smaller restaurant but they do take reservations.  Service is pretty consistent in that it is good - except for this one caucasian guy that we've had twice that never seemed into his job, never had recommendations, never refilled our drinks unless we asked and was pretty slow, but other than that, the other female servers we had were always friendly and knowledgeable.  I wish this place was closer to my house, as I would frequent it much more often.",

    "text": "I decided to stop in for lunch since I now work in the area. Once walking in one of the servers seated me and I sat up at the counter that they have by the cooking area. I enjoyed sitting there because I got to see all the many different dishes. As I am sitting down my server (Kenny - I asked another waiter his name) asked me what I would like to drink and I just said a water. I sit down and start looking over the menu and as I am doing this Kenny is waiting on a young lady RIGHT behind me. She is asking some questions about the menu and he rudely cuts her off and rattles off some options on the bento box and she asked another question (as you could tell it was her first time there and wasn't familiar with the menu) and he rudely states \"Like I just said, I told you the options.\" She then was trying to speak to him and he states that same sentence not once, not twice but four times in less than a minute. I was so shocked I actually turned around in my seat and looked at him! I have NEVER heard a waiter with such attitude! Maybe he was having a bad day...who knows...he proceeds to come to me to take my order and I try ordering and he CUTS ME OFF mid-order!!!! I would have like to have asked a question but I knew better!! Two more people were sat in his section and he proceeded to run to the back (as I can see from where I am sitting) and yells right in a female co-workers face about why people are sitting in his section! Why would you treat someone like this!!! I mean he was RIGHT in her face. I was so embarrassed for her even though she didn't see me noticing this. I was in utter shock at this point and one of the chefs could see this and asked me what was wrong. I told him that I have never seen a ruder employee than that and pointed to Kenny. He apologized and tried to make it better. I could tell the chef was very embarrassed as he took pride in his workstation, the customers and his service and this one employee was ruining it for everyone working around him. I tried not to let this A-hole of a waiter ruin my lunch. My soup came and that was very, very good! then about 10 minutes after my soup came he said my california roll will be ready soon. As I am done with my meal I am waiting for Kenny to come back to get me some to go containers. He walks over to get them and I noticed that two bowls stuck together when he went to get one and he threw the other one on the lower counter like he was VERY annoyed! I just was speechless at this point. Again, I talked to the chef who was amazing and made my lunch as he was very sorry for his co-workers actions.   I eat out a lot and I have never experienced this kind of service EVER! I will be actually calling and filing a formal complaint as this was unacceptable.   I will be back but refuse to sit in his section...EVER!",

However,  the most recent time I've came here the service I received was absolutely horrid! What's even worst is I was so happy to show my friends this place I loved to eat at. The waiter we had was a tall white male with a naploenian dynamite blonde hair. He was so rude, disrespectful, and obviously does not care for his job. I hope management corrects this immediately or I will find another place to eat. Overall, awesome food but shitty service.",

The bread was soft and sweet--Oh so good. The Tofu Steak came with a sauce and mushrooms which was a good starter with just the right amount of flavor. The pad thai tofu and tan tan men -vegetarian style was less desired with no variances in spice and little to no kick. I was disappointed, but it was decent it just lacked flavor which I hoped it had",

The food and drinks are both fantastic. I haven't tried an entree I haven't liked!  However, it is not a sushi restaurant, despite having a wide-variety on the menu. There's no open sushi bar, and the quality can be hit or miss on the rolls. I recommend going for the main entrees.",

Our date place. She loves the udon suki and the sushi. We've been here so many times in the past two years and the staff knows us by name. It looks creepy from the outside plaza but you walk in and it's like you're in a completely different place. Words can't describe how much we love this place, if I had a last meal before I died, it would be here. 100%",

The restaurant itself is quite small and seating is limited, but it is worth the wait.  My personal favorite if you are a fan of Udon noodle soup is the Udon Suki Iron Pot. The broth is very flavorful, udon perfectly slurpable, beef a little bit too lean but mixes well, and the egg totally rocks it.   Zaru Soba is a cold noodle dish that i have ordered and is quite good. it's not much on the dish besides the buckwheat noodle and you dipping it in the Soba soy sauce. Nice refreshing starch.  Sushi is ok but I would stick with the rice and noodle dishes.  The menu is quite extensive so I'll definitely return often to try out all the other options.  Definitely recommend this place as a solid lunch option for a reasonable price.",

So good it made it on my shirt as well... than was taken to mouth sex Ramen cove with a big bowl of the TanTan-men... lots of heat in my body was producing at an almost swampy rate and maintained till the last drop.  Only thing i see that can improve is knock down that silly wall that divides the two different rooms for seating (more viewable space will make it seem less crowded i promise). Also unless your a Village inn or a bakery you shouldn't have a dessert display? hope that is not just me thinking that. A bit cheesy and the servers I'm sure would love the extra room for service purposes. Maybe a new expo window??  Will be back soon. Like tomorrow.",

    "text": "This place is exceptional. I ordered togo from here and the gentleman who took my order was very through and he even gave me a free miso soup. The finer details are what matters. When I picked up my togo order, the person who took my order asked me to have a seat at a table while I waited and he offered me some water which came in a plastic cup, a lid and a straw so I could take it with me. Thoughtful. He also asked me what kind of sauce I wanted on my Grilled Salmon and packed that in there for me. He later asks me what kind of utensils I wanted in there.   Wow, such customer service. All this I experienced in 5 minutes of being here.  From the looks of it, it looks like it may have been an Italian restaurant at some point because of the antique decor and brick walls. Usually there's Japanese posters, Japanese bamboo art, Japanese lanterns, but this place didn't have all of that, which isn't a bad thing, it's just something I noticed. I took a look around while I got my food and it looks like it's Japanese owned(+most are not) because I heard some of the sushi chefs and possibly the owner conversing in Japanese. It was fairly populated for it being 8:30PM. The place settings included a plate and a black cloth napkin rolled up with utensils inside. This is unusual for a Japanese place because most Japanese places will give you a paper napkin and a wooden chopstick that you throw away afterwards. There's also a sushi bar for those who like to eat their sushi right away.   The Grilled Salmon itself was a bit dry, maybe a bit overcooked to my liking but it went well with my ginger sauce. I also ordered some nigri and a tuna roll which turned out to be decent as well. I would come back here again and I see why this place is such a hit. I wanted to review anything but the ramen only because I see a lot of reviews on the ramen here. Next time.  Located across the street from 'Just Blaze' ( a smoke shop) and apartment complexes.

We love everything else about the place and will most likely continue to eat there- we will just request to not sit in his section.  On our last visit, the pompous waiter with the blonde pony tail first approached our table by saying \"what do you want to drink\" in a way that made us feel like we were inconveniencing him. He was several feet from our table and facing sideways. I asked for a Dr. Pepper and he rudely replied we don't have that and then I had to ask what they do have. He simply replied Pepsi and then I again had to ask what that included. He sighed and looked at me like I was a moron for not knowing.  My boyfriend has worked in the food industry for several years and it takes a LOT to upset him at a restaurant. But he immediately went to the hostess and asked to be placed in a different section.  The hostess was very professional and immediately sat us elsewhere with no questions asked. It made me think this has happened before. After a few minutes the rude waiter approached our table and with attitude asked if he did something wrong. I told him it was his tone, body language, facial expressions and over all attitude. I told him he has been this way several times with us. He tried to argue and I told him I didn't need to have this conversation. He smugly said sorry and walked away.  I have also seen him yell at the women who work there several times. I can't believe this man still has a job. If you can't be nice to people then why would you try to work in customer service. This prick is cherry blossoms biggest and only downfall if you ask me.",

PLEASE Cherryblossom, if you're listening, launch a location in OldTown.   Cha Shu Ramen #1 must, however definitely go with the egg noodles in this one. Smoky, creamy broth will have you feening.   Udon Suki Pot #2 must, they crack a raw egg on top to finish it off and the broth is so hot it cooks it. Deliciously flavorful beef broth.  Spicy Gyoza Soup Appetizer #3 must. Must. Must. Must. Warning, it is actually extremely spicy, it will make your nose run. But I literally had a couple dreams about it, it was that good.   I actually didn't like the champon noodles very much, but might be a personal preference. The tan-tan men noodles were very good as well. Sushi is decent. Haven't tried the asian-italian fusion dishes but my ex always ordered one and they looked absolutely fantastic.",

The disturbing part of it however, was that there were spaghetti noodles in it instead of ramen noodles. Seriously people? That was disappointing.

The service is great it's a very small quaint place with the sweetest server, if you are lucky you will meet the cutest Japanese lito elderly lady that has an adorable white bobcut and she is just darling! The place just has a great charm to it! Ok sorry moving on... foodwise the IKA mentai for Arizona is amazing! It's a unique and well done dish that is great for adventurous eaters with the palate to appreciate the umami of fish eggs. It by far was the best dish I've ever had there and probably in the surrounding area. I went last night and shamefully... am on my way back there now for the same dish.. haha. The ramen is pretty good there as well, the broth isn't super thick if that is what you are looking for but the flavor is good. They serve sushi there but it's nothing terribly special to be honest. If you aren't into something adventurous I recommend the yakisoba noodles, they are simple but done well. The noodles are well balanced and addictive! Overall check it out it's such a classic cute spot for the area. Lots of memories here!",

She also helped choose my entree because I wanted something that wasn't really on the menu. The spicy potsticker soup was excellent, great pad Thai and lots of other noodle dishes. They serve bread with the meal too (that Italian thing popping in) which is nice if you dine with picky children like I do.  They serve cocktails, but for once we didn't partake. Really great spot and very affordable too. I would definitely return next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Aside from the just really terrible hostess situation, it was a great experience.  The hostess situation was almost a laugh because it was just ridiculous. We walked in at 8, two hours before close, and one hostess was hunched over the counter doodling. She barely looked up at us, then looked over to her partner, who also barely looked at us and did not say a word. She grabbed two menus and motioned for us to sit down at the closest table, which happened to be sandwiched in the corner of two other populated tables. This is awkward for everyone, since the rest of the place was empty and we had to do that weird \"scoot around each other\" move any time someone wanted to adjust their chair. The silence of both hostesses was the most unnerving, though.   Whatevs, the food was great and our server was great and our bill was cheap! We got the sushi combo with a spicy tuna and an Alaskan, and even though I omit avocado due to an allergy the rolls were a good size. We also got the chicken pad thai and took home leftovers. All was well, and we will surely be back.",

Hakata Cha shu ramen- I'm not a fan of this one.. I have had much better ramen.  I try not to let my Californian snobby food opinion but I can't help it.  LA is home to so many AMAZING ramen places.  This was not even close to comparison.    Agedashi tofu- A bit different from what I am use to but none the less really good.  The sauce that it sits in is super yummy.  Overall, I might come here again for a second opinion... I'm not sure it will meet my expectations, my old roomie was a big japanese food fan and she brought me to all the amazing places in So Cal. So expectations are super high for ramen and other japanese appetizers!",

    "text": "Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe may look like it has an identity crisis, but I think it's just their way of Asian & Italian Fusion. While most of the menu items are Asian, there were a page full of Italian pastas. The menu had noodles from all varieties of cultures and even some rice dishes and sushi, while their decor was Italian more than anything else. Oh yeah, not to mention that their restroom was French...  It was a drizzly day in Phoenix. The storm from California was heading east so I was in a ramen mood. Although Cherry Blossom was a little out of the way from where I was staying, I still went the distance to get my fix. They had about 5 different kinds of ramen and I was about to get the Harata Ramen until I saw the word \"spicy\" next to Tan-Tan-Men. I love me some spice so I went with Tan-Tan. My appetite also pushed me to get a Tootsie Roll. My boyfriend decided to go with the Gomoku Yaki Udon.   The server brought out a complimentary salad and not too long later came our Tootsie Roll and noodle dishes. The Tootsie Roll was good, but it definitely wasn't the best quality. As for my Tan-Tan_Men, the bowl and its contents were huge. I was so excited to eat even though I knew I wouldn't finish it. As for the taste of the broth, it was spicy, even for me. I usually pride myself on being able to take on a lot of spice, but the fact that it was spicy mixed with the heat of the boiling broth made it even more intense. I even choked on it at one point, but as I kept eating it got more tolerable. It was tasty, but if I were to ever try their ramen again, I'd probably go with another one. The Gomoku Yaki Udon was very bland. It had a generous amount of seafood, but not worth getting.   The dishes may be hit or miss, but for under $7, my ramen was huge. I've been to places that give me less than half of the portion size for double the price. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good enough to satisfy my ramen fix. The servers were very friendly and efficient. I wish I lived nearby to try more of their dishes.",

Definitely not good if you are watching your weight...;)  There was about four chefs cooking right in front of us because it was an open kitchen and we were sitting at the bar right in front of them.  We saw every dish that they pushed out and they were all made from scratch.  The ingredient was definately fresh and the chefs has skills.  It was impressive to watch.  They served chinese, vietnamese, korean, american, french, and japanese food from that four chefs...",

If you're a foody like me, you know what I'm talking about when I say, \"Ramen\" and not  that BS generic top ramen shit... But yes they serve it here! =)  The Ramen was pretty good, not as good as Japan or in my hometown Bay Area, CA but it was good!   I enjoyed this restaurant because it's probably the only place I've ever been to that specializes in both Japanese and Italian cuisine.  THEY HAVE A AWESOME HAPPY HOUR MENU which literally cut the price of some menu items in half! =)   MUST TRY AND RECOMMEND!!",

There have been some that were less memorable than others, but they have all been solid.   Tonight's venture consisted of two Yakisoba dishes, one with chicken and one with seafood. The proteins in each were both cooked very well and the overall flavor of the dishes was bountiful.   I have yet to try any of the sushi or Italian options, but I look forward to giving them a whirl on one of my next visits.   The atmosphere here is super cozy, the service has always been friendly and to-the-point, and I ultimately have nothing but praise for Cherry Blossom.",

    "text": "Nice, warm, cozy, noodle restaurant. I had the Zaru Soba here. And while I can say I've had better soba elsewhere (I rather love soba, so I order it wherever I can find it), I can certainly also say that it was still delicious~! It doesn't lack in the quality department. The food portions of this restaurant are *slightly* smaller than I'm used to, but for the price they're just right. Our waiters and waitresses tended to us quickly and neatly. They were servicing more than one table almost at a time, and yet they moved perfectly like clockwork. Not once did we feel as if we had to wait for another table to be finished being served before we could ask for another order.  Ah, and I must say, their Sake Float... I'm not normally a fan of sake, or for most alcohol really... but this was definitely an exception for me. Then again, I'm a huge fan of ice cream, malts, shakes, floats, a la modes, and etc. I'm just surprised that it worked so well with sake. Other than that, their green tea milk is delicious - it reminds me of an old green tea dessert drink I used to buy in a bottle... they stopped selling those things in all stores I used to buy them at, so to have a similarly-sweet and smooth tasting green tea liquid treat in this restaurant was a wonderful surprise. And last, but not least, I just ordered their vanilla ice cream for dessert. Which complemented the foods I had that night wonderfully~  All-in-all, this restaurant was a lovely experience. I certainly do want to come back when I can. 4 stars for quality, service, and comfort. Not a perfect 5 because I know it can still be even better in their noodle quality/treatment.",

Their sushi is wonderful (I wish you guys would serve halibut!!) and their noodles are out of this world. Love the soba, chicken Parmesan, and especially the Salmon Cream Sauce.  Looking upon the menu, a newcomer would think that the owners are crazy; this place offers cuisine from Thailand, Korea, Japan...and ITALY...but they do it well. I cannot rave enough about their kitchen and the guys scurrying like madmen at the grill. Bravo.  Bravo goes out to Yuka, who is the real star of the show. She's a fantastic server. After knowing her for a couple of years, she now greets me with a hug and an ever-present loud and genuinely warm greeting.   I will never tire of this place.

I had heard that this is one of the few places in AZ that serves authentic Japanese food, primarily Japanese-style Ramen. Since being back in America after living in Japan, Japanese Ramen is probably the thing I miss the most. Well, after the wonderful people, of course! I know it is not originally a Japanese dish, but the Japanese style of Ramen is just the best! :) Oh, and GYOZA!! Of course!  Of course, when we went to Cherryblossom, I definitely had to have some Ramen. It was excellent, as promised! My husband had some sushi since he loves the stuff, and it was pretty similar to decent Japanese sushi. I think they had \"American sushi\" choices as well, which is pretty different. :)  Overall, it was a lovely experience. The environment was very nice as well. It was great to see some Japanese stuff on the walls and around the restaurant. It was pretty busy in there as well. My only complaint is that we didn't get to interact with any Japanese employees, so we could not practice our Japanese! :( There is always next time... :) Maybe we will have to sit at the sushi bar!",

    "text": "VERY POOR and DISHONEST service-  1) Our server (Asian older female) literally walked away when my friend and I were in the middle of ordering food. She left with such haste while in the middle of our conversation we assumed she had pressing, urgent matters that demanded immediate attention. Nope, not the case at all! Extremely rude! 2) QUESTIONABLE calculation of bill- CHECK YOUR TOTAL people (especially if you come for happy hour). They attempted to charge us for full price for some of the items. When pointed out incorrect calculation of total, the same lady gave us the BS excuse that since we opted for no avocado in our roll (due to food allergy), they charged us $1.50 more for IMITATION crab meat. They conveniently added this \"extra cost\" without informing us. Dishonesty at its finest, ladies and gentleman. 3) Same lady gave us a $1.13 \"discount\" off the total bill begrudgingly. Um.. Really now.. It doesn't make any sense at all.  Food- Definitely nothing to write home about. I've been here 5 times according to my Yelp check-ins in the last 4 years and definitely it hasn't been by my own accord but rather by friends' requests. My latest dining experience here was due to another restaurant that I wanted to dine in being closed, so we opted for this restaurant due to its proximity.  Appetizers:  - Panko shrimp: 3/5, nothing spectacular dipping sauce is Worcester-like sauce (weird) - Calamari: 2/5, definitely a boring choice as non-Asian restaurants can do a better job in my opinion - Karage chicken: 2/5, so boring as it lacks flavor and crunchiness - Agadeshi tofu: 1/5, not authentic at all and very bland (definitely a regretful choice) - Spicy gyoza hotpot: 2/5, tastes like \"Costco gyoza\" states my friend  Entrees: - Hiyashi chuka: 2/5, not authentic tasting at all as my friend comments it literally tastes like ramen and sesame dressing you can buy at Asian grocery stores - Nabayeki udon: 2/5, broth is so unremarkable even instant udon has more flavor  - Ramen: 2/5, broth definitely lacks complexity and depth and pork portion is pathetic - Rainbow roll: 2/5, questionable freshness and quality of the fish as the fish was lacking the vibrancy of colors and texture that would indicate freshness  Note: This is my first Yelp review ever. It's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one. Yet poor service and mediocrity of food has prompted me to advise my fellow Yelpers to definitely reconsider dining at this restaurant. I feel that the quality of food and lack of taste makes this restaurant makes it a 2.5/5. However, due to poor service and dishonesty, I have given an overall rating of 1/5.   On another note: If you want ramen, try Hana Japanese Eatery or Fujiya market (limited availability- check online for announcements).  If you want sushi rolls, try Sushi J, Sushi Catcher, Hiro Sushi, or Bei.  If you want nigiri sushi or sashimi, try Hiro Sushi.  If you want omakase, try Shinbay ($$$$).",

Service is just a tad slow but that is expected as it is a very popular spot apparently, so I don't mind because the food is worth the wait. For $47 for 3 very stuffed people, including appetizer, entree and drinks, had to take a lot home to as the portions were well sized.

I say this because their korean Jambon is one of the better ones in the valley, even confirmed by my korean friends.  I think the soup noodles, soba, ramen and all are decent, but U shd all try the japanese fusion pasta dishes.  Yes pasta is noodles too :)  I especially liked the spinach noodles with chicken in alfredo sauce.  Trust me cause I am not a big fan of creamy alfredo, but theirs is balanced without too much of the cheesy taste of alfredo and the spinach pasta was cooked closed to \"perfection\",  yes its that good the day I went as the spinach noodles was just right, a little past al dente but not too soft and not too hard.  I don't know about the sushi, but unless someone tells me they make a good sushi roll, I will not try it at a place thats called a noodle cafe :)    I also had a plum sake kind of cocktail.  Very good, very strong, even though it was a small cup.  My friend had the rootbeer float sake cocktail.  That one's worse and he feels the effects almost immediately.  Nonethless. Service is good. Price is decent.  Food is very good.  Definitely coming back.  Oh, this place is kind of small, so seating is tight, thus if you come in a big group, try and call ahead or get ready for a wait.  I know this place is famous for 30 mins to 1 hour wait, so don't be too surprised if you have to wait a while :)",

It took forever for the server to show up after we were seated, so an automatic minus one star for that.   And then when the waiter decided to come by , he was in an extreme hurry.   Ordered the sushi combo, added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice. Also ordered the philly roll.   Waited forever to get a refill for my drink forever. The only thing that they were fast at was giving us the bill, before we even finished eating!!!  The quality of the sushi was really bad, rice portion was lacking, the rolls were falling off and overstuffed with bland an unfresh generic seafood.  They forgot to get me my bowl of rice, this place is the worst sushi place ever. We also noticed that the people preparing the sushi were of Hispanic origin. That explains the sushi quality but it doesn't explain the jack of customer service.",

Service can be questionable: the nice waiters are super-nice, the not-so-nice waiters are tolerable.  Great menu. Asian food or Italian. Yum, yum, and yum!   Kid-friendly? Not so much. Small dining area. Kind of compact.   Decent prices. Needs a fresh remodeling, but no big deal.",

This time I had the Hakata which is almost the same as the Chasu Ramen but less pork - they didn't let me know that it was scrap bits of pork split between my friends same order! I was disappointed by the amount -if any- of pork that was in there! I would have to say, there are other local restaurants that actually give you the entire slices of meats. What a downer. :/ Anyway, the broth and flavor of the rest of the soup was still delicious.  Note to self: just order the Chasu ramen. There def should be at least one whole slice of pork, maybe??",

I told the hostess I would be more than happy to wait for a smaller table but she insisted I sit. So I did. Placed my order and shortly after got the appetizers I had ordered. Nearly done with our appetizers we were asked to move tables so a larger party could have the table THEY insisted I have. Embarrassed I moved myself and my child over to another table. I felt the whole place look at us as they moved us. I got the Tokyo ramen, chicken was hard and inedible like I was biting into those pink erasers, broth was flavorless, but the noodles were okay so I filled up on those. Needless to say I won't ever recomend this place or ever come back.",

First; parking. I will not say anything that has not already been said. It's tiny, it's cramped, it's like trying to find a seat in my apartment when I have friends over. Get there early or park on the street.   I ordered the spicy ramen, which is not very spicy, even for a wuss like me. Lots of noodles, a tasty broth, solid if unspectacular ramen. I also got the tempura shrimp roll, which while surprisingly thin on the rice, was still decent enough.   Service was a little lacking, but the joint was jumping so it's forgiven.",

I really hate leaving bad reviews but this place is a huge bust. The ramen looked sad.. it lacked personality and flavor. My udon looked as if someone threw up meat sauce with hot sauce no seasoning no salt on it. I really wanted to like this place... but the place didn't wanna like me...

I've had my fair share of different types of authentic noodles and came in wanting to try a noodle bowl of some sort but decided on something completely opposite based on the confusing menu.   They have Italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing. No pictures of the noodles but minimum description. I went with something I was familiar which was curry.   Asian places usually have good curry and different options also. This place only had one curry option. Their menu states: chicken, beef or pork (I forgot which), and katsu shrimp. I thought it was just the shrimp that was 'katsu' or having breading around it, BUT it was all of the meat options I suppose.   I don't like katsu. Had I known I would have not ordered this entree. The curry alone was not appetizing. My food was lukewarm if even warm. The only good thing about my food was the rice. It is very different from the other curry dishes. My plate looked as if I didn't even touch it. There was a manager on site, standing by the hostess stand, which was next to our weird seating arrangement.   You would think If someone left with a plate full of food that something is wrong and you would ask if everything was okay but that wasn't the case.   Not recommended by this Asian.",

    "text": "Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe (No really, the menu says it's one word) is another one of those great hidden little restaurants located in an unassuming strip mall in close proximity to a liquor store.   The name doesn't lie. You can order up some hot tasty noodles of course, but they don't stop there. While perusing the menu and munching on a dinner roll, I noticed quite a pastiche of cuisines. Many salads to choose from, rice plates with your choice of freshly cooked animal, and noodle soups.   But do they stop there? No. Sushi too. I'm not a fan of seafood. Even in the four years I spent in Alaska I ate seafood maybe a handful of times. Today I put on my brave pants and tried a Spicy Tuna Roll and it was great! Not fishy at all and was presented beautifully with a side of wasabi and ginger. I ordered the Yakisoba Chicken and it was hot, fresh and excellent. The little salad that was given to me was odd though. I couldn't quite place the dressing, but whatever it consisted of did not mesh well with the bitter lettuce.   Ok, so they have sushi at an Asian place. What else could they offer? Italian pasta. Yeah, pasta. Penne, angel hair, linguine and tofu noodles. Arrabbiata, Bolognaise and Cappellini sauces. Calamari with Anchovy Tomato Sauce. The \"Ika Mentai\" - fresh squid and spicy cod with butter sauce.    Whether you want Asian food, seafood, sushi, or Italian, this is one-stop shopping. The dessert counter looked excellent as well with cheesecakes, mousse (is the plural of mousse also mousse?) and eclairs, but none for me this time around. The banana bread that is served with every meal was enough to sate my sweet tooth.",

I was so surprised by the exterior that I wasn't sure of it'd be that great of a place.  Originally looking at it, it didn't even look like a sit-down from the exterior, boy, I was surprised.  This place is great, I loved every part of it, from the bread to my takoyaki appetizer and my ramen.  The people caught on really quickly that I drink a lot of water and kept the water coming which is very difficult in my opinion.  It's weird but one of the major points for me that I care about.  The food and the service was fantastic, the wait was a little longer than I thought it should be but it made up for it.  Also the place is disguised on the exterior in my opinoin and I would've taken longer to come here without the reviews here.   I'd give it 4.5 if I could because of the wait on the food but I hope it's better next time.  I will definitely be returning here again.  ---------------------- I just took the full star off.  Should be 3.5 stars now.  The last 3 times I've been here, it's too much waiting.  It took 40 minutes to get my food the last time.  I think something needs to be done about the wait time and why doesn't the waiter ask me how I'm doing or bring me water?  I appreciate those kinds of things!",

I will break it down like this, I thought there was to much on the menu yet nothing caught my eye maybe I just wasn't in the mood to have so many choices.   1. Our server was an ass! There was no one in the place yet he waited on us like they were full to capacity and he was the only server. He couldn't have been less concerned about serving us.   2. The tempura we ordered was very blah, nothing to write home about.   3. My sister went on and on about how good her dish was. Mine was way to spicy I asked for mild. So the manager offered to change it to something else. I ordered pad Thai no tofu again mild. How can you go wrong with Pad Thai. You can it was a glutenous mess. The noodles were so over cooked it was disgusting.   4. The decor was cute. That's the only good thing I can say.   I have not been back. My sister has but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth literally. You get 2 stars one for decor and one because my sister likes it.",

Whenever I don't know what to eat, whenever I'm happy as can be or feeling down, whenever I want a home cooked meal, whenever I'm with a good friend or on a date and want to have deep conversation be, and whenever I'm want really delicious food: CherryBlossom is always there for me.   The wait staff is always pleasant. There are fresh flowers to greet you. Banana bread and rolls to tide you over till your food is served.  It's never too crowded or too slow. The cooks always make a delicious meal. I'm partial to the Tori Nanban, Yakisoba, Duck Salad, and Chicken Katsu, but all the food is great. It's a noodle shop, so they know how to cook pastas, udon, soba!   If Hawaii is melting pot of cultures, then CherryBlossom is the melting pot of delicious foods - Japanese, Thai, Italian. Sushi, salads, pastas, soups and drinks! Perfect place because there's something for everyone.",

    "text": "Had been wanting to check out this spot for quite some time, and as the line next door at Oregano's was far too long, we decided to stop in and were seated immediately. Even though our orders were put in and drinks brought promptly, we oddly received our dishes individually. By the time my 3rd friend had their food, it is no doubt that the other two would be digging into a less than steaming meal. It is quite possible the slower service was a fluke incident b/c we were seated in a backarea where waitstaff barely trafficked....  I ordered one of the 4 specials of the day. A Hot Soba noodle soup in a miso (think thicker and creamier version of your typical miso broth) with bok choy and shrimp. The miso soup is what made this truly tasty! All meals come with a bread basket including banana breads and cinnamon crisps (totally random for an Asian place, but nonetheless yummy).   I hear it's best to shy from the Italian menu (smartly tacked to the back of the menu), but who needs Italian, when there is so much else I want to test in the future!",

    "text": "The main reason I love to visit my family in California (besides the fact that I love my family) is that I get to eat authentic Japanese ramen. Cherry Blossom Noddle Cafe comes pretty close to California-good ramen.  Firstly, I am basing this review on 2 dishes- tan tan men and the Korean spicy noodles. I would love to try other items on the menu, but these two are just too good to pass up. The tan tan men is my favorite by far. Best ramen dish in AZ, for sure. It tastes just like the spicy tonkotsu ramen I get in Cali, even though tan tan men is a completely different dish than tokotsu- go figure!  If I am ever craving ramen (which is all the time), I come to Cherry Blossom and have their tan tan men. One day I'll try their other assortments of ramen. Any ramen/Asian food enthusiast should definitely hit up Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. One of the best places in AZ!",

I took home a couple of baked buns for lunch the next day which were among the best i have ever had.. very soft and fresh. You have to get there early to get those... they usually sell out before the afternoon is over.   It was a really nice surprise. I will look forward to going there again.",

I ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet.  Honestly, it tasted like the cook was trying to get rid of some leftover food from the lunch hour.  I did like the crunchy bean sprouts - the only thing that gave the dish any texture at all.  Mixed in were the asian style noodles I expected and also spagetti.  They were both like mush from overcooking.  Though I ordered chicken, I found very little but there was loads of tofu in the dish which I wasn't expecting.  Also - the food was very bland.  Not a hint of kick to it at all.  I may have just come at a bad time, but I don't think I'll go back.",

    "text": "Something inside each person is the desire to try something new. What makes a restaurant memorable? I for one enjoy the choices provided by unique establishments that bring delights from multiple cultures into a friendly place where you can take your friends, family, date, or wander in alone just to experience new possibilities. When you combine the tastes of two countries, Italy and Japan, you get Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe.   I have always had the friendliest service at each of my visits and delighted in bringing my family members or friends to visit and watch them enjoy the mounting possibilities of combining decisions. What nobody expects is how filling the food can get. Sometimes I'll have some sushi and try a different noodle dish than last time, and other times I'll close my eyes and point at anything on the menu - and I have yet to be disappointed.   The Noodle Cafe's atmosphere appears cramped, but there is a lot of detail that makes it special even when it is full. I will have to admit that sometimes I have felt forgotten by the staff sometimes, however it always seems so busy and their smiles are so big that it doesn't matter.   The standard appetizer dish given to you when you first sit down consists of several kinds of bread that take my mind off the outside world and make me realize I'm here to enjoy something tasty. The hustle of the staff and the laughs of the other patrons make me less aware that I am actually in a small strip mall in the middle of a city that usually doesn't feel like I'm around other human beings. Honestly, I make up every excuse to visit and recommend this restaurant to everyone.",

    "text": "The best real RAMEN in town. The waitress brings  you a steaming bowl of noodles and pork which smells so incredible.   Very surprised and delighted how authentic it is. It's a popular place so be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours. Skip the sushi and stick to the noodle selection.  Visit #2:  Went back with L who just got back into town. Didn't tell him how far it was from us b/c wanted him to drive. Is that evil?  But the food is worth it. We shared the shrimp spring rolls, came with a snow pea and carrots inside of the roll. The dip for the spring rolls was good. He had the chicken marsala pasta and I stuck with the ramen again. Pasta was good. We must've been hungry because we finished everything. L thought it was a very strange place because of the whole Asian/Italian thing going on. And because of the random assortment of bread that is served: banana bread (YL's favorite), cinammon toast, and sweet bread rolls.  Okay, it is a bit random. But, what the heck...it's still good.   Only complaint is that the server was a bit off, took forever to take our order. AND that a gaggle of women sat right behind me shrieking in Mandarin for an hour. I wanted to switch seats and sit next to L \"bistro style\" but he wouldn't have it.  \"Too weird\" he said. Good lord, my friends are uptight :-)  Visit #3:   Took W here last night. We ordered BBQ appetizer and panko oysters. I liked the oysters and the BBQ. They were out of the crab croquettes. Another bowl of ramen (can't help it! I just love it) and W got the hakata  yakisoba which was tasty. You end up smelling like food when you leave, so leave the fancy duds at home.",

This is the first asian/ITALIAN fusion restaurant I have even seen (and I'm from LA). They have a wide variety of italian pasta dishes that were very reasonably priced. Their asian dishes ranged from yakisoba to sushi to chicken katsu to who knows what else.   We were all very impressed with the portions, price, presentation and service of the restaurant. We went on a saturday night after the CELTICS BEAT THE BULLS, and it was pretty full. Some of the other reviewers said that it takes a long time, but I think that's only True for very large parties.   YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE BREAD THEY SERVE. The dinner rolls are good, but the banana bread was incredible. Not too sweet. Pretty much perfect.   For 5 people, the bill came out to be around $80, tax and tip. Pretty decent.

    "text": "My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.  The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for \"Cha Shu Ramen\" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)  The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some \"roadhouses.\"   Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.  It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.  If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)  I think it's too small for groups over six.  Maybe we'll see you there.  Added 11/18/07 I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for \"Hakata Ramen.\" For extra pork, ask for \"Cha-shu-men\" or \"Cha-shu-ramen.\" Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.",

I've taken my sister and her boyfriend, my cousin and her boyfriend, several other couples, and they've always LOVED this restaurant.  Located in an unassuming little stripmall on Camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in Arizona), the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is so tucked away, you'd never know it existed.  Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good.  Any how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons:  1. QUALITY. The food is ALWAYS excellent.  I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty.    2. VARIETY. My boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.  The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well.  They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!  3. AMBIANCE. I always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.  4. STAFF They've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff.  They're always smiling and helpful.  The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people.  So, come to the Cherry Blossom.  You can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that Valley isn't all Mexican or big-box/chain places.    BTW, since the place is small and intimate, small double-dating size groups are good, but this is no place for massive groups.",

I can get clam linguine in a white wine sauce, along with spicy Korean bbq beef in soba noodles, which is exactly what we did one night.  The flavors were excellent, although a little muted, and the amount of clams were amazing. There was a little bit of sand in some of the clams, but to me, that shows the dedication to having a fresh piece of seafood on the plate.  I also thought that my wife's clams were swimming in the sauce, as there was a TON of it on her plate. Conversely, while my plate was cooked well, I felt that 1) the beef needed to be spicy, and 2) there needed to be more of it. I really felt like I was eating more noodle than anything else.   And that's what keeps this place from getting a 5. The little things, like a lack of spice, too much sauce, the absolutely dreadful & schizophrenic decor, and, well, on our night, the single server handling the entire restaurant.    There are some nice little touches though. They serve you some of the best banana bread that I have had in a long while, their green tea is tasty, and the menu selection is above and beyond what I was expecting. I'll come back, that's for sure, and you should definitely give this place a try.",

This being our first time at Cherry Blossom our waiter was very accomadating & helped us with suggestions. The food was fantastic!! My husband ordered the Korean Spicy Beef Noodles & I ordered Yakisoba with seafood (minus the calamari & asked for SPICY!!!) they were both excellent entrees. If this restuarant was closer to us we would probably come back weekly until we tried everything. The portions were quite large & the prices are very reasonable. I want to thank all the other YELP reviewers for also leaving excellent feedback to help us decide on this little gem. We all know you can't always believe what you read BUT this place is worth a try. REALLY!!!",

I choose CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe as it was an interesting place and I was in the mood for Ramen.  I had the Spicy Lettuce Wrap with Shrimps & Vegetables to start.  It was good but I do not see how anyone could eat it as a wrap...very messy (I ended up putting the lettuce in the bowl and ate it with a spoon).  For the main dish, I orded the Ramen TanTan-Men.  The Ramen, I would have to say was pretty good and was enough to fill you up.  Over all I would rate this place 3 stars and I would come back.",

The broth was rich but not at all greasy, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The portion size was perfect. The best part: it cost only $8.   We arrived at 6:15 PM and were seated at one of the last open tables. By the time we left at 7:30, there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated. And mind you, this was on a Monday evening. So get there early and be willing to try something new--they have a huge menu with lots of interesting choices--choices that I will be trying in the very near future.",

    "text": "3.5 stars... Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe is a really good concept.  (It's a shame that Phoenix is lacking on options when it comes to Noodle Houses; Chicago, New York, and DC have noodles galore but we're not there yet I guess.)  Anyways, Cherryblossom has a welcoming ambiance and decent service too. I've been a few times, so I figured it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after Urban Affair.  (It was Friday night around 9:30, so no problem getting in and seated right away).  We sat at the bar and got drinks immediately.  Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )    We finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.  Either way, I would skip the Yaki Udon and go for something else on the menu when you go.  Although I wouldn't rave about the food on my most recent visit to Cherryblossom, it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner.  We were in and out in less than an hour and it was $20 out the door with tip - can't complain about that!  I'll be back!",

(I had two other people try it to confirm I wasn't just crazy and imagining things - yep - freezer burn!!) The sushi is okay; I've had better in AZ. Udon was good but if you've lived any significant amount of time in Japan it won't blow you out of the water or anything. Our only complaint about the tempura was that it was too small. Yummy kabocha is worth a star to me! :)  The customer service was... interesting. We came at lunchtime on a weekday and it was very busy, so the slow service was totally understandable. However, our server was very abrupt and practically threw dishes onto our table without even so much as a \"Here you go.\" Wow!   My husband is a recent immigrant from Japan and he was hoping to find a place where he could get a taste of home to satisfy his cravings. At least as far as ramen goes, Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe won't be it.",

We were there ten mins before drinks arrived. A couple ice teas. Our server seemed new and awkward, which I can appreciate because I am a server also. I believe his name was Quincy. As soon as our food arrived I asked for the chili paste, he forgot it. I never got a refill on my drink or saw him until the very end of our meal. The food was decent but nothing how it usually is at all. My husbands pad tai had calamari and scallops in it??? But it never has that and he hates calamari.  (he gets shrimp pad tai) my food wasn't hot despite being on a skillet. It was a confusing experience of our favorite place.

I am a very picky eater so any place that can make me want to come back is worth at least 3.5 stars to me.   Cherry Blossom seems to have a bit of an identity crisis though because while it is known for its Japanese food, especially the noodles, they sell Italian food as well for the people who are not as adventurous with their meal choices. If it were up to me, I would get rid of the Italian and stick to what they do best: Japanese.   Every time I go to Cherry Blossom, I find myself reviewing the menu for the millionth time but returning to my home-base anyways: the veggie tan udon. For those of you less versed in Japanese cuisine, vegi tan udon is a bowl of udon noodles with vegetable tempura in it.   Another thing that keeps me coming back though is that there are numerous vegan and vegetarian choices which is great for a vegetarian like me.   My last note is that the service is phenomenal almost every time, with the exception of only one waiter that I really dislike. He is extremely dense and not very knowledgeable about the food on the menu, not to mention hard to get along with. He is the only reason that Cherry Blossom doesn't get five stars from me.",

I was born and raised in Japan, and this is so far the only Japanese restaurant that I've been to which serves essentially the same dishes as in Japan.    I've seen some complaints in price hikes such as the Unagi (fresh water eel), but the market price has gone up in the last several years by 60-70%, so it's not their fault.  Service is usually pretty good, but it can get pretty busy on some evenings.  Luckily, they have some complimentary bread rolls and mini-cinnamon toasts.  It's not enough to spoil your appetite, but it's something to nibble on until your food arrives.  Basically, it's the only Japanese restaurant that I go to, because I know I can get good, satisfying food for a good price.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now. Initially, I was impressed at the management of a huge table (we had like 20 people) and the waitress had no problem doing separate checks and was quick upon return with the checks and change.  Yet when I went with just another person, although crowded, the service was not that great.   The one thing that was odd - some food came out fairly quickly, yet others' orders took forever.  Some of my friends waited about 20 minutes after everyone else received their dishes, and it's not like they ordered something totally different. In fact, some of the orders were identical to the other friends. Then again, we did have 20 people.  During the time I was just with another person, it was a similar thing - my food came out way earlier than my friend's.   I ordered the summer rolls that were quite tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered miso soup and edamame which were both delicious. My mom ordered the pad Thai and loved it. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food one could order for a decent price.    The parking could likely get to be a problem. I managed to find a spot, but during busier hours with the other surrounding businesses, I imagine it would be messy.  Also, the only other negative thing was that my mojito was really not that tasty.",

    "text": "I've driven by Cherry Blossom countless times and always discounted it as yet another mediocre Asian restaurant in Arizona. But somehow tonight in the middle of a crazy monsoon I was driving around Camelback looking for a place to eat.   Rosie McCaffrey's? I just had diner food yesterday. Too similar. So as I was driving east, I passed by the strip mall that Cherry Blossom is in. I noticed there were a lot of cars in the parking lot.  \"What's going on here?\"  I pulled in and I walked into what I thought would be a random, mediocre noodle cafe. Now, when you walk in, it IS random. Japanese lanterns and bamboo screens mixed with European lithographs and other random American chotchkes.  I sat down and ordered an Asahi, some edamame and the chicken yakisoba (the place is a noodle cafe - ordering sushi just didn't seem right, and I was a little concerned with the whole page of Italian pasta dishes on the menu).   I expected the server to be right back with the edamame. Instead he comes back with a basket. Of bread. One sweet roll and a slice of banana nut bread. I sat and stared at the basket for a few seconds, because it didn't really compute. I've never eaten bread, much less banana nut bread, before Japanese food but I guess there's a first for everything. The edamame didn't come for another 10 minutes which was a little strange. When they did come, they were perfectly cooked and salted. It was another 10 minutes for the yakisoba, but man, the dish was incredible when it appeared in front of me. One bite and I knew this place was special and that I had to come back to try the ramen.   And I knew I needed to kick myself in the ass for ignoring Cherry Blossom for the 9 months that I've been in Phoenix so far. It's minus a star because the wait took longer than expected, but for all it's randomness, this restaurant is an awesome find. Apparently half of Phoenix already found it because the place was completely packed.   But hey, better late than never, eh?",

I am not usually the dessert type  but we decided to \"go all out\" and order dessert and we were NOT disappointed. I am not sure if their desserts change daily but all I can say is that I dream about this cake. It is not  too sweet, is moist and has fresh oranges, kiwi, strawberries, etc.",

    "text": "One day, I was craving something light and healthy, and this place seemed just the ticket. Trying to avoid the Camelback construction, I wended my way through a residential area, and lucked out on a sweet parking spot.  I didn't really have the time or desire to eat there, so I grabbed a menu and placed an order to go -- the seared tuna, and some soba noodles. And I waited. And waited.   For the record, there is no waiting area, per se. I just stood around by the door, kind of looming over some poor guy's table. I explained to at least 4 different groups, that I was not waiting for a table, and they could go ahead of me. When my food was finally ready, I quickly paid and bolted out the door.  In the comfort of my cube, I unwrapped the goods. The tuna looked lovely, a good shade of red, nicely seasoned crust, presented on a bed of greens, with a soy-based sauce on the side. It tasted fantastic as well. The noodles were rather plain, the broth unremarkable, but not bad.  I would definitely go back, but would phone in my order first, or dine there.",

Italian decor? WTH was going on.  This restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.  They don't really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, \"WELL WE HAVE SALADS!\" -_-   They need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious!   Honestly, I probably won't be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn't bad, just wasn't special.",

The decor is friendly, the menu - short and simple.  The cooks....not Japanese. But the food is somehow still very authentic and delicious! I had the curry beef which was pretty delicious.  The hint of cumin, the soothing miso base and those delicious soft yet just chewy enough udon noodles.  I also had to try their supposed banana bread.  Let me tell you, this place would get only 4 stars from me but one bite of the banana bread elevated cherry blossom to 5 star!  It isn't as good as my wife's but holy cow it comes close! So next time you are in Phoenix and slowly melting under the laser beam focus of the sun, shelter yourself under the friendly atmosphere of this noodle heaven.  You will be glad you did.",

    "text": "The Cherry Blossom Cafe is the greatest place on the planet Earth. You might think I'm overstating things. You also might be wrong.   The  service is two parts perfection and one part adorable. One fantastic server is this extremely polite Japanese man, who is sincere in his ways and clearly would never hurt a flea, much less a shrimp like myself.  Another server is clearly into comics and tells it like it is. I respect him.   Before your meal comes to you, the tastiest bread rolls are placed before you, and eating them is a spiritual experience. Shellfishly, I long for a second serving of bread rolls, but alas, the entrees are worth waiting for. Hearty and delicious, the miso ramen was the very first item I ever ate there, and I think about it often. If that's not your style, you can never go wrong with a rice bowl, a salad, or a rice plate.   The most anticipated part of the meal may come at the very end, if you choose to treat yourself to a slice of cake. They are just as good as you think. The servings are large, and thankfully taking food home is not a problem. When I leave the Cherry Blossom Cafe, I go with a little more of a spring in my step. It is a great way to have lunch.   Tl; dr: The Cherry Blossom Cafe has not only taught me to love food, but to love myself.",

I recommend coming here if you love Asian soups or noodle dishes, because they have plenty. They have a variety of dishes to chose from and their cold noodles are so good. On another note, ice shaved drinks is next door to this place. The first thing they give to you is homemade rolls, which is equally as appetizing as their food.",

My faves are their spicy Korean beef, crispy calamari, and sushi combo (great deal).   Service is consistently spotty. We went about a month ago and our server kept breaking glasses as she was really rushed. That was annoying as we were seated by where she was breaking the glasses. I love the bread they bring to the table but when I recently ordered takeout ($45 worth of food), the guy told me they no longer provide it free for takeout and would have to charge per roll. Cheap!!!  Regardless, I love this place and will continue to return even if I have to deal with the inconsistencies.",

    "text": "Updated review 7/6/2010 - I have revised this review several times, and I feel like enough time has passed since my last and final (this time I mean it) disastrous visit. Service is hit or miss at CBNC. My wife loves CBNC and pleads with me to give them \"one more chance\" I protest each time and then give in. On our last visit, we arrived right after work around 5:15 hoping to beat the dinner rush, and it looked promising, we were the only ones in the place. Service couldn't be a problem right? WRONG! The hostess seated us in the back room, and I said \"here we go into the land of the lost ... again\". I sat down and started the stopwatch, five minutes went by and no waiter, ten minutes, no waiter, twelve minutes, another party is seated a few tables down, at 15 minutes, a waiter came in to take the order for the other party. I got up and walked out with my wife following. What came next was horrific. I reached over to unlock the passenger door and when I went to put the key in the ignition, there was an elderly Asian woman lightly hitting the drivers side window, pleading with me like I just kidnapped her only child. I think she may have gotten down on her knees at one point pleading and begging for me and my wife to come back in. Now when I go out, I like to have a pleasant low key experience. I like for waitstaff to be professional and I don't mind if they get a little bit informal, but I cringe when the line is crossed and it becomes personal. What was developing in the parking lot was extremely disturbing. My wife felt so sorry for this woman and insisted we go back in, I argued with both of them that this had been the fourth or fifth time I had received such poor service that second chances had long expired. I buckled once again and walked back in, and I'm sure the waitstaff was thrilled to see me. The woman visited our table every 3 and a half minutes to see how everything was going, making uncomfortable comments in broken English. This was becoming a dinner I would never forget, and for the final insult, she threw in a slice of cake to go on the house. What a mess! Some people explain this poor service at CBNC as a cultural misunderstanding, but I do not accept that explanation because the waiters are white Hispanic and Asian. My advice is to take your business elsewhere.",

    "text": "I got to do the ordering tonight... and it was a fabulous meal at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe! I have never seen a restaurant that is so eclectic... you have traditional noodle dishes, both hot and cold, from Japan, along with Sushi; pasta dishes from Italy, and some items from SouthEast Asia! There is more than enough diversity in their menu to satisfy the most discriminating palate. Despite their diversity, CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe does not stray from the basic tenant of Japanese Cuisine: food items are never too salty or too sweet, and are never bland; you can call it cooking subtlety.  For starters I ordered a California Summer Roll (Vietnamese) for my friend and myself. Unlike the Vietnamese Summer Roll spiced with mint, and usually accompanied by a lime dipping sauce; CherryBlossom's version was accompanied by a sauce comprised of sweet Sesame Seed / Soy Sauce dip. A Summer Roll contents include Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Crab strips, and Cabbage wrapped with a thin Rice Paper \"tortilla\". Anyone used to the Vietnamese version will see CherryBlossom's as probably a little bland... but you have to remember the philosophy behind Japanese cooking.  My friend also had Miso Soup with his meal. Unlike the soup yesterday evening, he said the Miso Soup was very good.  With every meal, you will also receive a bread basket ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcherryblossom-az.com%2Fcherry-bread.gif&s=479c695537901297682a890c5829de28f7cb7cb0cbb584543e2876cb7aa00ca1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cherryblossom-az.com/che...</a> ). The basket contains three types of breads: a soft and warm French Roll; a slice from a dark and sweet Blueberry bread; and a crispy Butter Biscuit. There is enough variety in texture from all the breads to satisfy anyone.  Main dishes...  I ordered for my friend Grilled Orange Roughy. The Orange Roughy was grilled to perfection and was accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce concoction. Sides consisted of Japanese sticky rice.  I ordered for myself the Beef Nanban Soup with thin Soba (Wheat) Noodles, rather than the Udon Noodles, accompanied by a bowl of Japanese Sticky Rice.   My friend does not drink, but I ordered the Rasperry Fruit Punch, a very good drink made from Raspberry Wine with Fruit Punch... essentially a Raspberry Wine Cooler (but stronger). This drink also had an umbrella \"thing\" spearing a whole strawberry! Very good and refreshing!  I had my usual coffee after the meal which surprised me a little... an Amaretto laced coffee was brought out. The aroma was very enticing! Would make a coffee drinker out of anyone!  100% of capacity, with 30% Asian; 20% Hispanic; rest Caucasian. First time I've been to a restaurant that was packed with NO seats left! A very popular spot!  CherryBlossom is very heartily recommended so long as you remember the tenets of Japanese Cuisine... no extreme flavors... nothing will be extremely spicy, salty or sweet. This makes it easy to grab a little from this dish, and something from that dish without disrupting the flavor of either.  There was something that was a little disconcerting, though... The state of the men's room. For such a highly rated establishment, it seemed like no one had checked on the men's room for about two to three hours... toilet paper thrown around, stains around the wash basin. Nothing really objectionable, but a little surprising considering the number of staff for such a small establishment. This establishment has to be aware that a restaurant is judged by it's back-room as well as it's front room. Won't take anything off... but it is highly noticeable considering...  And the diners of CherryBlossom has to share the same restrooms with Tokyo Express (right next door), both of the businesses are probably owned by the same management group.   The interesting tidbit is that we both spent MORE for a worse meal last night at Bamboo House... AMAZING! My friend said his dishes from the Summer Roll to the Grilled Fish was some of the freshest tasting dishes he ever had; good compliment from him. In fact, he wanted to go back to CherryBlossom the next evening... but this is my last night here in the Phoenix area.... sigh....  (I really think everyone is reviewing CherryBlossom under the wrong spelling.... It's CherryBlossom, not \"Cherry Blossom\". Take a look at their sign or their website.)",

We called the mistake to the waiter's attention and he said that this would be taken off the bill. It was not.   The sushi was C grade. Passable but not anything I would return for.   Our order came with a green salad that resembled bagged salad. The miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it. Quite surprising and added nothing spectacular to the dish.   My ramen was poorly executed, with undercooked noodles and only a few pieces of meat floating in it. I was really disappointed as I have had really great ramen at a handful of other restaurants around the country. I was looking forward to this japanese staple, but sadly left most of it in my bowl.   I find it odd that this restaurant serves both italian and japanese food, Maybe if they focused on one type of food the flavor and presentation would improve.   We will not be returning.",

This is my hubby's favorite place for ramen noodles and he told me the broth is pretty close to the flavors you'd find in ramen houses in Tokyo. According to one of the employees, the broth cooks for at least 6 to 8 hours to develop its rich flavor. The pasta with squid and cod roe is also a favorite. Too bad we live so far from it, otherwise we would go much more frequently.  Be sure after dinner to stop by Snoh Creamery a few doors down. The shaved ice is creamy and delicious.",

Cherry Blossom is a very different and authentic restaurant. If you haven't tried it I definitely reccommend it. I have had noodles before and most recently tried the curry and both were great. My husband had the pad thai and enjoyed it as well. They also have some italian noodle dishes if you have picky eaters with you!",

It's a cozy place to have party with 20+ people. We pretty much take over 80% of the space.   The sushi is just as good as any other good Japanese restaurant. However, the sea food noodle soup I ordered is a little too salty. They also offer diner roll and Thai foods, which is unusual in the Japanese restaurant.   I can tell they work really hard to fill up 20+ hungry party animals. I was too full to have the dessert. Their frozen chocolate cake looks very delicious. I will visit again without the entire party.",

I went there this evening, got my name on the list and was told 45 minutes. It was very busy. After about 45 minutes of waiting, I go inside to check how I'm doing on the list. While waiting to check, they sat several couples who just walked in and put their names on the list (I was standing there watching). Then she suggested I would still have quite a wait left. It appeared they were just taking groups as they came in and would only bother to get people outside waiting when there wasn't a line. At an hour, I decided to go elsewhere. This is not the first time it's happened.   It doesn't really matter how good the food is if you can't get to it.",

Which makes it even surprising they also serve your favorite Italian dishes, spaghetti etc. It is also a small quiet place, very intimate so bring a date, catch up with a friend you name it! Menu is simple and to the point, lots of specials when it is happy hour time and lunch/ dinner time. I've been to happy hour a couple times, sushi and small appetizers were amazing, the special cocktail drinks were superb as well. Cherry blossom cafe will for a fact when your heart if you love rice, noodles and tempura chicken. Hey it's the simple things right? But they're done well, the restaurant also is in a good location for other options as well, but if you're in the camelback area definitely don't miss your opportunity! As always stay hungry Phoenix.",

Of course when offered more chili I dropped a spoonful or two in but only to add to the heat, the flavor was pure perfection! The prices were reasonable, the service was prompt and friendly and the menu offers so many choices, ramen, sushi, udon, miso, salads, and wait for it....Italian yes you read correctly bit unique but is that ever a bad thing..?

He Italian dishes look authentic, although I can't help but returning for the Asian food.  The decor is quirky but the service is fabulous. Best to go early in the day as the wait-time can be considerable.",

Have been going here for about a year now, great for a cozy date night or to have dinner with friends. Staff is always super friendly and helpful. The pot stickers are great starters. Only thing is they run out of Italian soda flavors fast, but their that great!!",

The cake is light as the clouds and the strawberries float amidst the layers in angelic bursts of freshness, not to mention that the whipped cream is well worthy to bathe in. I will say my last trip, I managed to take two slices (you can never have one) and tried the green tea cake. This may have just become the next contender for my affection. If you want indulgence without guilt, try it! I promise you will be smiling from ear to ear :)",

You will need to park in the neighborhood and take a nice walk.    Walking in the front door it's a very small and quaint place with a few tables and some booth seating.    We were seated by the door and it was definitely a little warm like some of the tips said.    I ordered the Korean spicy beef.  The portion size was perfect and the flavors were on point.  Just enough spice to make you sweat a little but not burn your mouth off.  The beef was tender and had a good mix of veggies.  Over all great price and portion size for the dish.   I also ordered one of slices of blueberry banana bread which was a perfect finish to the meal.   All in all great place and I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "It still confounds me that an Asian and Italian combo restaurant would be so successful, but it somehow truly is. Cherryblossom is where my bf and I go when we know we want to go out but we can't decide where to go. I always get something from the asian side of the menu, and he gets something from the Italian side.  Food: I'm not sure if this is only a lunch thing, but I love that we always get bread with butter and a ginger soy salad. I love both of these things, and I rarely get them at the same time at the same place, so it's a nice little treat. As far as the Italian options go, the Arrabiatta is solid, but the real star is the pepperoncino. The spice level varies from day to day, but it's still always good. A great kick, but simple otherwise. It's a new favorite, and I can never get the bf to try anything else since we found it. I'm still exploring the Asian side of the menu--I've gotten the beef nanban (a bit sweet), nabesaki udon (standard) gomoku yakiudon (my favorite so far), and a variety of ramens. Highly reccomend.   Service: The waitresses I've had have always been so sweet! They're a little slow on the service, but they're nice and always stop by to check on us to make sure our meal is going well.  Ambience: the place is a little dark, and sometimes I worry that other patrons are forced to listen to my conversations because the space is so cramped, but in general it's a very casual, warm place.  Parking: I've never had a problem finding parking for lunch on a weekday or weekend; sometimes I have to park a little further, but it's still in the same lot! It's definitely not as tough as some other reviews paint it out to be.",

Cherry Cherry Blossom It's a Noodle Cafe Phoenix's where you'll find it Listen to your belly Cherry Cherry Blossom Yakisoba Noodles Always like the first time Let me take a bite  Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe has been a love of mines for all times! Ever since my move to Phoenix, I've heard of this place. As time pass and new places started to pop up; Cherryblossom was able to stand it's own ground and still pump out great dishes with consistency!  When I'm in need of a good warm noodle dish I come here. Their Ramen is pretty solid in general, but I'm more of a fan of their fried Yakisobas and my new favorite Nabeyaki Udon hot pot! Packed with a variety of seafood from shrimp, scallops, calamari, hamaguri, white fish, and vegetables; this hot pot is steaming with flavors that mom used to make, if you lived in an Asian household! This dish is definitely recommended on a cold winters day in Phoenix....like 70 or below haha!  Overall, Cherryblossom delivers when it comes to good o noodle dishes. They even serve pasta which I've ever tried. The ambiance is cozy and cute and service is quick for sure, but I can't say they're super friendly at times haha! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been missing out. Why have I waited so long to try Cherryblossom? Really I have no idea. I have been missing out, that is all I know. In search for a great bowl of Ramen I had bookmarked Cherryblossom over a year ago. When my husband said he was craving Ramen he other night, I knew I waned to give it a go. This is a small cafe. Gives you the feel of one of those old houses, made in to restaurant kind of vibes. There was a wait when we got there, but since there were only 2 of us we were able to sit up at the small counter they had. It was attached to the kitchen so we were able to watch the cooks go nut's and make magic in their small kitchen. It also gave us a chance to see everything that came out of the kitchen as well. One of the things I saw come out o the kitchen window was pasta with red sauce. And boy was it popular. It was so popular that I almost changed my mind. But I decided I'll save that for my next visit.   We talked to a regular that was at the counter as well, he talked my husband in to the Undo Saki: Beef Sukiyaki in Undo soup in a clay pot. Ended up being a great choice. I tried a few bites. It was rich and full of velvety flavors. The noodles were a thicker type noodle. He added an egg on top winch gave it an even more rich flavor after breaking the yoke.  I went for the more traditional kind of Ramen. The Hakata: Green onion, Kikurage, and BBQ Pork. Every thing you want in a good Ramen. Lot's of warm silky broth, tons of noodles, and the BBQ pork had a nice flavor, both a touch of sweet and smoky. I also got an egg. I recommend it.   I had no idea that I would feel like I was eating out of someone's grandmother's kitchen. Like you could feel the love and put in to the food with the whole feeling like your in someone house. When you leave here you feel so content. All warm, cozy, and full from the hearty soup you just had. It was a very surprising yet completely enjoyable experience.",

PROS: The prices are great and they serve fairly large portions of all their meals. My husband and I have been here at least a million times and we have always left full and satisfied with our meals. The best part is when you find something you like here you know it will be delicious and exactly what you were craving on the drive over. I always get the Hakata ramen. The broth is amazing. I've tried similar ramen at many other establishments around the valley and none of them come close to theirs. Their sushi is also pretty good but if you're wanting to eat the sushi before you get ramen, order the sushi first and then place your ramen order when your sushi arrives. The ramen comes out extremely fast and is best enjoyed hot (obviously)   CONS: This place is busy on the weekends so expect to wait! As long as your hunger can withstand at least 30 minutes for a party of 2-4 you should be okay! The wait staff can be slow but remember they're also very busy on weekends so it's expected. Other than that, in the last 5 years we've been coming here we've always had nothing but great food.   Overall, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone!",

They have an open kitchen concept so you can see the cooks behind the counter. I ordered a grilled pork belly appetizer. It came with 5 thick pieces of pork belly with a sauce and some vegetable garnishes. It was served with rolls and butter. I made a little sandwich out of the pork belly, roll and vegetable garnish.  For dinner, I got the Tan Tan Men because most of the yelp reviews talked about it. It was delicious and spicy. It was spicy soup ramen with minced pork, bok choy and bean sprouts. My sister ordered the Shoyu ramen. It was more of a traditional looking ramen with fish cakes, bamboo, slices of pork, green onions and seaweed. It had a dark earthy broth.  Service was good. Our food came out promptly. We were offered dessert even though our waiter was pulled from every direction by the time we left.  There was plenty on the menu to want to come back for more! I saw a sizzling meat plate being served before we left. I might try that next time!",

We rolled in around 9pm, which is apparently the perfect time to go on a Saturday night according to our nice server. They ran out of bread, which was fine since this was already going to be a carb-fest. On our server's recommendation, we got the seafood udon and napolitan pasta. I had pretty low expectations based on prior reviews, but both dishes were solid winners, especially the udon. The napolitan pasta was the restaurant's vibe on a plate - a mash-up of Italian and Asian flavors which was confusing at first, but admittedly delicious.   This wouldn't be my first choice for date night, but something tells me we'll be coming here a lot. For two entrees our total was $26. Parking can be awful in this tiny lot but it was only half full at 9pm.",

Noodles were solid and very good consistency and miso and spicy ramen were both fantastic!! Think the miso ramen was the best ramen on the menu!! It was flavored perfectly!! The spicy is good but maybe Just a touch too spicy to fully enjoy...The age tofu was pretty good but not traditional way...octopus salad was excellent!! Drinks are nicely priced!! Overall excellent spot!! Will come back!!",

    "text": "Cherry Blossom Cafe  I'm sure the French have a good word for it, I know I don't other than the expression, \"mom-and-pop\". This place is a real find!  A real one-of-kind mom-and-pop! I didn't meet the owner/operator but I bet my last nickel there is one.   How did we find this joint?  Well, every time we drive east past the area of Camelback and say, Central through 7th St., you pass Oregano's, whose consistently, quality and service are days gone by -- long gone.  (This last time I visited Oregano's, about three weeks ago, the three-card-Monty-like bartender gave me the willies.  And it took 40 minutes to get a roast beef sandwich--that's a serve-up item, bing-bang-boom,dine!  No, 40 minutes!  I mean what the fudge? They weren't cooking the beef while I was waiting!)  And every time I pass the little shopping center, same north side of the street as Oregano's, probably 3rd Street (there's a Domino's there), I always notice the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe and think, \"I gotta try that place\". Well, we did, that was Christmas Eve.   The menu is Asian and Italian. Now, sometimes that's the kiss of death - two cuisines - but sometimes it's just a fork in the culinary road. It was so good I cannot wait to try other things!  We ordered 1) penne with a spicy marinara that was served perfectly hot, perfectly sauteed. Funny, it seems so obvious and so simple and yet it's been 100 years since anybody prepared me a simple dish so well.   I can tell you this: read my review of DeFalco's Italian Deli  -- it's stellar. I love DeFalco's!  But I've had spaghetti at DeFalco's 30 times and if you combined the heat of all 30 dishes it wouldn't equal how steaming and wonderfully hot this pasta was. Incredible flavor and preparation.   We took a chance and ordered the Chicken Marsala. I say take a chance because I've really had some bad representations of Chicken marsala lately, most notably Olive Garden (horrible flavor, chicken quality, too was sub -par. Flavor was just amateurish. I know, I know, it's Olive Garden!  But Olive Garden isn't giving anything away!  That Marsala was $16 bucks!)  See The Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe's very accurate description of the Marsala: \"chicken breast, fresh spinach and spinach pasta with a creamy Marsala wine sauce\".  Now, imagine that dish arriving at your table steaming hot, so delicious, so very fresh. While more \"creamy\" than \"Marsala\", definitely more creamy than I imagined...it wasn't at all what I imagined -- and still it was freaking DELICIOUS. And the menu description was -- IS  -- quite accurate.   If not \"elegant\", a word that comes to mind, I would add \"professional\".  The folks here know what they're doing.   They offer great food, priced right, gracious service, are there 6 stars?",

I've been multiple times and sampled quite a few of their food options but I'll say, without a doubt, I'll be sticking with the sushi.   Not because the sushi itself is anything spectacular, just that the rest of the menu is severely lacking. Still a great place to bring picky eaters or an indecisive date! In fact thats how I ended up trying this place in the first place, and don't let the strip mall appearance fool you, this place can get packed!",

I got the double shrimp tempura roll and it was so good. After we had our sushi we ordered some ramen to share. Ended up being so stuffed we couldn't have dessert but we took some home with us. I got the double dark chocolate cake roll which was the best I've ever had. Not too sweet but also not bitter. Just perfect. They have a huge selection of fresh baked goods they make in house every day. We were simply blown away with the quality of food. There were so many choices of drinks, great food, and desserts. If you love finding hidden gems, this place definitely meets and exceeds on all accounts. You won't leave dissatisfied, I promise.",

We were able to move to the main dining room tho so that was nice. The service was very good but the food did not impress us. The tempura was greasy and soggy. The seafood yakisoba was boring, flavorless, and had very little seafood - the cabbage in it was bitter and the dish did not seem fresh. The matcha tea was quite good. All in all we will check out other Japanese restaurants before we go back to Cherryblossum.",

It has deceivingly more seating than you'd think so I've never had to wait for a table. They have a decent happy hour with a good mix of sushi, appetizers & other options. I usually get sushi & some kind of noodle dish or soup. On my most recent visit I got a Philly Roll & Spicy Gyoza Hotpot. It was delicious & filling! So much so, I had to take some of the Gyoza home. The waiter was kind & very attentive. I remember one time service being slow, & they were very apologetic about it. They gave my friend & I each a free dessert to thank us for our patience. I'll never forget being very pleasantly surprised because even though it was slow going, we weren't impatient & didn't complain about it. It was nice they took the initiative to try to make it right!",

Luckily we got in just on time before a line started to form. When you walk in the place it's pretty small and cramped but the atmosphere is great. You can see the chefs cooking up a storm and everyone enjoying their food.   As we were seated it took a little bit for us to be greeted, by the time the waitress arrived we were ready to order. My fiance and I were a little thrown off by the full menu of Italian food. I ordered the bbq pork ramen (I forgot the name) and my fiance ordered the bbq chicken ramen. After ordering, it took us a while to get our water, but we just enjoyed our time together and didn't complain. We could see the waitress was a little overwhelmed with the full house.   As we received our food, to our delight it was absolutely amazing. The ramen was cooked perfect and the broth was defiantly on point. This has to be some of the best ramen I have ever tried! I gave four starts because the service can be a little better, but the food was so great we looked past that.",

I don't like to order any alcohol beverages because you don't get that much of it.  When l leave this place I smell like food. But that chicken Marsala is worth it I guess..   Parking sucks as well.

I was introduced to Cherryblossom by my good friend Dhargya, a former tibetan monk, who now travels the world doing massage and healing energy work.  We've been here a few times together and knocked back some sake over dinner.    This little plaza right beside Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub has a Nail Spa & Salon, Snoh Ice Shavery, Beer & Wine Store, Vape Store, Domino's Pizza and a Cellular Phone store, a little something for everyone.  Cherryblossom is almost always busy.  We've often had to park on the side street in the neighborhood.  Do yourself a favor and visit soon!",

The menu was also very expansive.   So, about the setting, it's nice and modern and cozy. It has somewhat of a home feeling to it. Very clean and does not smell like food, which is good or bad depending on the place. This place not smelling like food is a good thing because it fits with the setting of the restaurant. A place like In N Out Burger would be great for smelling cooking burgers.   After sitting, the waiter shiuld give you some rolls and this small crunchy bread thing and butter. They were super delcious, for bread. For the food that made me full, I ordered the Udon with chicken. It was typical udon and had spinach and other small veges and chicken chunks in it. It was delicious.   I would definitely come back here because it's very very good. You should come here if you have not or come back often if you've been here before. Seriously, so great!",

Try making it down during happy hour, they have a happy hour menu with different rolls, Korean beef short ribs, beers, and other tasty things.  One of my favorite things here is the green tea mousse, but they don't always have it, so get it if you can.

    "text": "Really excellent service on this Sunday night.  Very cramped seating though.  I had a nice parking spot outside, which can be hard to find in this plaza.  I didn't care for how a thin hot mustard looking sauce was pooled in the middle of the shrimp shumai I ordered, but a good wipe with my cloth napkin fixed them.  They were sweeter, more fishy, VERY onion-y, and not as savory as the pork with shrimp and mushroom shumai I usually have at dimsum places.  I heard an Asian woman at another table add an egg to her ramen (secret menu!), so i emulated her, adding one to my hakata ramen and hoping for the best.  I was not disappointed!  Finally, a place that serves the egg soft boiled/poached with a liquid yolk perfect for adding richness to the noodles.  I do wish they had a shoyu or bonito-type broth besides the pork broth they use, but that's just me preferring saimin.  I do feel that service has improved over the past couple years (they had a blonde waiter a couple years back who was pretty rude).  The one time that there was an issue with my food (cooking twine from the pork) the server apologized and my meal was comped.  Their baked goods including their table bread and flan are really good.  Their ebi fry and inari are standard issue but solid.  The katsu is quite good, though not mind blowing.  Being used to Hawaiian portions means I find it a little small, but I am sure hats healthier!  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  Sometimes the wait will be long, but the food is solid.",

The only down side was the appetizer and how they put in our food. When I ordered, I chose an appetizer which the server said it was shrimp dumplings, however, what we got were shrimp shuimai. If I knew it was shrimp shuimai, I wouldn't have ordered it because of the obvious differences between the two. This is the probably just the Asian side in me but that bothered me because they are two different dishes. As for the food order, it took us 45mins to get our actual dinner because the server didn't put the order in until 10mins after we finished our appetizer. We spent almost two hours there for dinner so that's a big drawback for me. Other than that, I do think it's a good place to eat since it is very delicious with a cozy feeling.",

However, I must say that they do a great job of getting people seated in a timely fashion considering the lunch rush. Noise level was pretty average for that time of day and I can say I've been in louder places. The seating was comfortable, we were at a table right near the door so we had some good people watching. I liked the decor and lighting as well. Appetizers - We got the fried/breaded veggies (forget what they're called) and Kioza (sp?)(pot stickers) They both were really good and not too heavy. It was perfect for three people. Entree - I got the Chicken Parmesan and I must say, it is one of the best Chicken Parms I've ever had in my life. The chicken was breaded and baked to perfection; the noodles had the right consistency and although they could have done with a little more sauce and cheese, I can't say anything bad about it! Can't comment on beverages because we all had water, but some of the drinks being served throughout the place looked quite tasty. If you're looking for Italian or Asian Noodle dishes, come check this place out and if you're in the mood DEFF TRY THE CHICKEN PARM!",

Attentive, intuitive, and friendly overall.    The food was also delicious.  The Pad Thai definitely had some citrusy undertones to it.  It wasn't very spicy but they have a very tasty five spice chili pepper shaker on the tables that boosted the heat substantially.  The Korean Spicy Beef was very good as well.  It had decent heat and a well balanced, full flavor.   We also order some sushi as an appetizer and I admit I was a bit biased against it being any good.  Mostly because a restaurant that bills itself as  Japanese, Italian, Asian Fusion is usually not likely to have decent sushi.  I was wrong.  My wife wanted the Vegas roll.  That is a roll that I generally dislike.  It is usually over breaded, or has too much cream cheese, or various other things wrong with it.  I vastly prefer nigiri or sashimi to rolls.  In this case I was pleasantly surprised.  It had a light tempura battering and the roll itself was extremely well balanced.  I would definitely order it again.",

Both dishes had plenty of shrimp!  I love the warm bread they serve prior to bringing out your meals as well.  CherryBlossom also always has a great assortment of desserts.  This time we had the peach cheesecake which was amazing, and highly recommended. I feel like a lot of small restaurants have slow service, but that is not the case here!

So we decided to go back to Cherry Blossom for the second time, because we really enjoyed it the first time around.  The second go around confirmed it! This is a great restaurant!  We started with the Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot. Which consists of gyoza in an extremely spicy broth! That kind of spicy that makes you talk funny! But the combination of tasty gyoza and the spicy broth was absolutely scrumptious!   For dinner I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, Iron Pot. A well flavored broth with seafood such as, calamari, fish, clams, scallops, and the wonderful thick Udon noddles! I like my Noodles thick!   If you like Ramen, Sushi or other types of Noodles, CherryBlossom is a great choice, there is something for just about everyone.",

I've had sushi, salads, Italian pasta, udon soup, desserts, all of it. I've never had something that was less than good and most of it is delicious. I've brought many friends and family and they agree the food is good.  The Prices. The prices are very reasonable and despite many visits we are often surprised with how low our bill is considering the quantity and quality of food.  Cons:  The Service. The service isn't exactly bad but it is frequently very slow. The servers are polite but it can be hard to flag them down and difficult to get refills especially during busy times. Also, beware because ordering sushi here is an extremely slow process. I've had friends get full meals from appetizer through dessert before I even get my sushi.  The Bathrooms. The bathrooms are shared with another restaurant and are usually quite filthy. They are also single stall bathrooms which I hate in a restaurant.  I do recommend you eat here though. The food is most definitely worth it. The cons really aren't enough to stop me. Just plan for some extra time.",

I usually get the Cha Shu, which is a ramen soup with pork and a cloudy tonkatsu broth.  The \"Extra Spicy Gyoza Pot\" soup appetizer is also good, although it's definitely only for people who like their food REALLY spicy (believe me on this one - I have a pretty high heat tolerance)!  Other menu items are hit and miss - the Shrimp Shumai had a bizarre breaded consistency and I was lukewarm on the sukiyaki, but I liked the miso eggplant and the spicy tuna roll.  The restaurant itself is cute, and the woman who works the hostess stand is really friendly, so overall I think Cherry Blossom deserves 4 stars.",

The soup wasn't that great to begin with but when I get the bill, they added a surcharge  of $2.00. For what I know, salmon which is included in the soup is a lot more expensive than tofu! It wasn't the money, it was the fact that I wasn't informed. I certainly wouldn't have paid $12 for ok soup. When I told the waitress, she said that's our policy. Won't be coming back. From reading other reviews, it seems like the restaurants ego is getting out of hand. They think they are better than their customers.",

Not only was the sushi mediocre, overpowered with sauce, and timid in its use of fish, but overpriced for its quality, some of the most disappointing in memory. I can't speak for the noodle dishes, however, though a friend ordered some and was satisfied. Perhaps it's the noodles I'm missing in this equation, but I'm unsure if it's worth another try.",

    "text": "So...I love this place. The Extremely Spicy Gyoza Hot Pot sold me on this place the first time I went and I return over and over again just to have it. That said, I've tried relatively few things.   The sushi is fine, not amazing. I like it enough to order it most times I go but I wouldn't go there just for sushi. The lettuce wraps with shrimp and vegetables are good but messy to eat since they are served with thinnish romaine leaves rather than the round butter lettuce leaves most places use.  My husband gets the pasta every once in a while and loves it.  I've tried his plates a couple times and I think it's good, not great, but that could be because he drowns it in shredded parmesan and I can't taste the real flavor it came out of the kitchen with.   Next time I will get Tan Tan Men. Other Yelpers have raved about the Ramen and, although I've never tried it, I expect it to be delicious because it's made with the same soup as the Extremely Gyoza Hot Pot which, as I already mentioned, I LOVE.   Now for the not so good...(but not so bad either)... The last time we went we sat at the bar for the first time. Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you can for two reasons: 1) when the place is busy, which it often is, the food takes a while to make it to your table and being able to watch the cooks provides a bit of entertainment to make the time pass quicker; 2) there's more space at the bar than at the 2-person tables. We usually feel pretty cramped at the 2-tops once we have drinks and an appetizer on the table but there's a little more elbow room and room for plates and drinks at the bar.   However, sitting at the bar has a downside also...when you can see the cooks putting all the plates together, though it's entertaining, you can also see all the things they touch without wearing gloves.  I've never been sick after eating here and I will continue to eat here frequently despite having seen all this, but it does make me pause to think a bit when I watch a cook dip his bare hand into some seafood (which he throws into a pan presumably hot enough to cook off any germs) and then wipe his hand on a repeatedly-used wet towel as he grabs a bunch of lettuce leaves for a salad plate (without any heat to cook off germs) that goes directly out to the customer. Admittedly, I don't know much about proper food handling and what's ok and what's not, but bare handed food touching always weirds me out a little.    That said, the food is delicious. It does take a while to get from ordering to eating but the cooks are hustling so I can't complain. Try the Gyoza Hot Pot. It's awesome. 5 stars without the wait and bare (but potentially clean-ish??) hands on food.",

My husband brought me here for the Ramen. Noodles are a comfort food to me and I was stressed out about an interview. The food was fantastic! The waitstaff was friendly and bustling everywhere.   The ramen is perfect! I'm pretty sure that the only way to get better ramen is to be in Japan. My husband had a traditional bowl and I went for a spicier version with wider noodles. We also added a spicy tuna roll (large enough for two) and a plate of pot stickers. Everything came out fresh and hot, there was both silverware and chopsticks available (for which I'm grateful....I'm still learning to handle chopsticks), and even with the snug seating arrangement (I could have reached over and snag food off my neighbors table) it never felt rushed or uncomfortable.   Also, this cafe is one of those strange combination fusion restaurants. They've combined Japanese with Italian. We didn't try any of the Italian food, being there strictly for the ramen, but the place was bursting with people ordering huge plates of noodles with red sauce.   If this place were closer to my home, I'd have to make a special budget item for eating there regularly.",

Cha-shu Ramen - Anything with BBQ pork here is a winner. Ditto with anything ramen. Tekka-don - Slightly sweet and citrusy tuna bowl. My friends always steal mine. Yakiniku - Perfectly tender Korean beef on a sizzling plate.  Iron Pot Udon - Seafood and beef are both fantastic. Spaghetti Bolognese - My partner sees me check in at lunch, starts craving this, and drags me back for dinner. Dessert - Look at that cake and tell me you don't have room.  Banana Bread - The answer to every question about hidden gems in Phoenix.  For a noodle place, I'm never super impressed with their yakisoba. I still order it sometimes, and you should try it, but it isn't the absolute best thing on the menu.  The owner and waitstaff are super friendly, but service can be slow, especially when it comes time for the check. If you have a show to catch, definitely ask for the check with your meal.",

    "text": "Thank you to Becca and Dave H. for getting me to go to this restaurant. Yes, it had been on my bookmark list for over a year. Yes, every time I went by I said 'I want to go there!' And, yes, I did browse their menu online on several occasions and yet...I never went here. Well, when I got a text from Dave inviting us there, I knew it was time. Boy was I happy! The food here was great. They brought out bread at the beginning of the meal (which is very strange for an Asian noodle place), but the bread was good, especially the cinnamon toast..yum. I ordered the spicy gyoza soup on happy hour for only 5$. It was large enough for two meals and had tons of flavor. The gyoza was nothing special, but the broth was amazing! So spicy and flavorful...it was awesome. I got to try Becca's Tantan noodles (or something) which was spicy noodle soup with ground pork.....ohhhhh definitely what I would get if it weren't happy hour. It was so delicious, similar to the gyoza soup, but with more smokey flavor. It was wonderful. The two guys got the beef curry noodle soup which was odd, but in a good way. It had a middle eastern flavor that was really delicious and something I had never tasted before. It wouldn't be something I would order, but it was very good. The prices were also reasonable, about 10$ pp. Needless to say, I will be back without hesitation!",

The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are so friendly.  Beware of the leg on the front door during the haloween...heeheehee...",

    "text": "I went here with some friends a couple weeks ago at about 830 pm. It was great. I asked the server what he would recommend to me and he said the Pad Thai with chicken. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The server was very friendly and helpful.  We came back a few days ago at about 430 pm and I was not as impressed. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but I was not happy with the server we had. She took forever to get our drinks and was not the friendliest. She also took my husbands soda while we were eating to refill it and took forever to bring it back. It was not even empty yet. I like the Pad Thai, but there is nothing else very appetizing on the menu for me. I would come back for the Pad Thai.",

    "text": "We had our first visit at the recommendation of a friend who had the foresight to get reservations.  Good call because the line was out the door.   We were seated quickly, and we ordered soon after since we had previewed the menu online.   The food took quite a long time to come out which was disappointing because our reservation was at 7:00 pm, so dinner was already late.  They offer a bowl of bread, but we had to remind our waitress several times to bring some for our table. Service was pretty much the same the whole evening when asked for spicy sauce, sweet n' lows, refills, etc.  The food was pretty good.  The sashimi salmon was fine, but the spring rolls and the spicy salmon roll were perfection.  The miso soup was not like other miso soup I have tasted, but it was good, even though it had a ton of green onion. Overall, the food ranged from fine to wow, but I do not think we'd go back again due to poor service.",
