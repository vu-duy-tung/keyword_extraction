Would highly recommend. 5 stars for service, drinks and food.",

This is not a \"Mexican food\" restaurant like one of the -berto's.  Think Joyride Taco (but better) or Blanco Tacos (but more inventive).  Needless to say, Chico is an awesome addition to the downtown dining scene.  I've been here twice for lunch already, and the food and service was excellent both times.  The baja fish taco is an early favorite -- the orange cumin gel and black garlic crema on the fish taco are an inspired combination.  I also highly recommend the Nichie's appetizer -- I can't really explain it, so just trust me and order it.  This and Bluehound are probably my top two right now for a lunch spot right downtown.  I'm excited to go back and eat my way through the menu.",

Luckily there is one next door but irritating if your coming downtown just for dinner. So the restaurant.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was inattentive to say the least. He was too busy twirling glasses and talking to the waitress to ever once ask if I wanted another drink, or even how my food was. The food was good, not amazing or anything special.  The establishment was clean but nothing to write home about. The $11.00 Margarita was in a small glass and tasted terrible so I ordered a coke. Which came in a bottle. You even had to pay for chips and salsa. No rice or beans with my meal either. Upsell, upsell, upsell, at every corner. If you like expensively overpriced tacos, bad service, no parking, and crappy drinks this might be your spot. For me, I won't be back. Ever.",

There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and it took about 15mins before someone came and brought us water. Then about another 15mins before a waiter came. We had ordered some items only to be told they no longer make them. So we went ahead and order the table side guac, and few tacos, salad to share and another appetizer to try. The table side guac came and the guy making them didn't say one word to us, and the guac was bland for $14, pretty disappointed. Then our tacos came out and the entire order was wrong. We never even got our salad or other appetizer and the guy who brought us the food said the first waiter put the order in wrong. When we asked where he was he told us he had gone home. He never even came to let us know he was leaving, follow up on any drink refills, or check on how the food was. Our SECOND waiter gave us attitude after we complained and blamed the other waiter. No manager even approached us to ask how everything went and we weren't offered a discount for the mess up. Super disappointed and I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Worst service ever and good wasn't that great.",

We were told that the restaurant features art from all different local artists! The mural bookcase in the back is spectacular. Now for the food...I wish I could have sampled one of everything and had such a hard time deciding what to get since it all sounded so delicious! We ordered chips and salsa and I couldn't get enough of the green salsa. Great flavors and unlike the typical run of the mill salsas! I got the fried avocado, chorizo/potato, and chicken tacos. All were amazing. These are street taco style packed with quality ingredients. Serious flavors in all of these. We were way too full to get dessert which is shame because it sounded delicious! Overall, extremely impressed with the restaurant from the service to the food. It's a must try!",

I am reminded a bit of El Hefe in Tempe, I bet the nightlife here is fun as well.   If you are down town check it out.",

Both were perfectly made, and I knew from that moment Phoenix had stepped up its restaurant game. The service was unbeatable. Servers were knowledgeable, and gave great recommendations. The short rib Barbacoa is a must have! Thanks Chico Malo for an awesome time!",

We ordered the ribeye and a side of broccolini. Also the traditional Guacamole. The ribeye was fine but lack that kick of flavor I was hoping for. The broccolini was charred. Well, actually it was burnt. Why? Broccolini is a delicate vegetable. Why charr the heck out of it? The Guacamole should have been called the raw onion dip with a little Guacamole. Yuk. And I like mine spicy! They no longer do the tableside one, so you get what they bring you. As far as the service, that was very good. The was one issue when we first sat down that they gave us a Brunch menu instead of a dinner menu. When I pointed it out to what seemed to be some kind of manager, her demeanor changed. Suddenly, it wasn't the friendly person asking us if our waiter had come over yet, it was a snooty girl that grabbed the menu and when she returned with the correct one, just slapped it on the table without a word and walked away. No, oops sorry about that or anything. Just this still cold person.  If we felt that it was more of a authentic Mexican cuisine we would probably be back but, nope!",

I couldn't choose between the 3 dips for the chips- they were all great!  I got the green chili chicken with the coconut rice and my wife got the plain quesadilla.  That chicken and rice was badass!  Cake with 4 corn tortillas that they make in house.  Nate, our server, was very helpful and informative.  Definitely will be a go-to when we're downtown for events.",

I was celebrating my birthday with a group of friends (there were 9 of us) and we decided to grab dinner before the comedy show since I enjoyed the food and service last time I was here. The food wasn't the issue. I love their food here, it was the service.  Melissa was our server and she was extremely rude to my friends. She had an attitude the entire time but tried to almost down play it as if she wasn't being rude. She told my friend to look at the menu when he asked what was on tap...RUDE. 1. You are a server, so it is your job to answer questions. 2. It took him more time to read through the menu, when you could of easily told him... Secondly, she brought over two different salsas so we asked her which one she liked better..normal question right?? Guess not, because her respond was \"figure it out\" and she walked away. Lastly, each couple (3 couples) ordered 3 different appetizers. One for each couple. She decided to split The Trio two of us ordered with another couple and charge them $8 for something they did NOT order. They ordered their own appetizer so for her to go out of her way to do something no one asked her to do was irritating. We didn't have time to go back and forth with her so they paid anyways but the point is they paid for something they didn't touch.  I'm bummed that my friends didn't get to have a good experience and I brought them here to celebrate my birthday.  Oh and not to mention another guy who was bringing a beer to our table spilled the beer all over my friends arm and didn't even apologize!!!!! Clearly, they have no manners.   The diablo shrimp tacos are delicious though and I do recommend them, but not the server.",

Well Chico Malo doesn't disappoint you! Once you enter you're surrounded by a great modern, loft like interior. The open kitchen greats you as you walk past the bar area. The entire space is warmed up by comfortable tables, great lighting and decor. Okay you're saying...what about the food? Fasten your seat belt folks...! Chef Chops Smith doesn't disappoint. His creativity and culinary detail will knock your socks off. Chico Malo has an amazing and diverse menu of offerings. My dining companion and I hard a hard time deciding on which dish was going to win the coveted 'last bite' award. We both decided that the Papas Con Chorizo was the winner. WOW...! I had the Baja Fish Taco served ever so lightly breaded and fried with and served with the perfect bite of spice and sweet, all on a Squid Ink tortilla. I also ate the Crispy Avocado Taco. What an incredibly fresh bite that was. My co-diner also had the Crispy Avocado Taco, as well as the Pork Belly Taco...YES a Pork Belly Taco with charred broccolini and pistachio! Let's not forget the cocktails...! the House Margarita is not to be missed. Ever so tasty with a hint of vanilla. Enough about how good the food was...the service was just as welcoming and attentive. I love attention without any hovering or interruptions. We spent 3 hours there for 'lunch' and felt so appreciated and not a burden to our server Hector was great! Special thanks to the mgr Zach O'Haire for the special cocktails. The descriptions of their background blew my guest away, in a way that made you want to jump right into your drink. So Yes, we enjoyed this new addition to CityScape and can't wait to go back!",

The steak was more like a T-bone instead of skirt steak but was flavorful and tender. It came with some pickled beets, thinly sliced onion and tomato, guacamole, home-made tortillas, and a fantastic chimichurri sauce. The sauce really enhanced the steak and gave it an Argentinian touch. Service was good, and I left very content with my meal.

    "text": "Delicious! Great location! Awesome patio! Visited for the first time, after stumbling upon it as we were walking through cityscape and made the best choice by picking Chico Malo! We started with the Guacamole with the Pomegranate in it and it was AMAZING! It was very difficult to chose a drink off the menu because they all sounded great but I chose the Paraiso Tropical and it was to die for! The service was just ok. It wasn't terribly busy or anything either but what they lacked in service, they made up for in quality of food and great atmosphere! Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "Location: Perfect location right in the middle of downtown phoenix Cityescape the congal its perfect indoor and outdoor patio.   Food: I had 3 tacos. Asada. Al Pastor. Baja Fish. The only thing i can say its that they were disgusting. Asada was okay very bland no real flavor of a real authentic Mexican taco no salsa. The Al Pastor taco was definitely not edible like it was put in some kind of pan after it was roasted you could taste it plus it had some kinda of fruit on it. They did not offer any salsa neither. The \"Baja Fish Taco\" which they should be sued for even calling it that. It had pomegranate NO WHERE in Mexico will you find these kind of tacos. Its a shame not even a lemon that always goes with any kind of fish in any type of Mexican food. It also had two types of fruit sweet paste.... yeah not salsa again... paste. I was even afraid to ask what they were. The famous guacamole was not an option after seeing that it had jicama and watermelon you dont put those in guacamole. Oh and ceviche does not have watermelon neither IDK why they would put that in there. Very weird and not Mexican menu. I would be okay if they would call it what it is and not what its not and thats a Mexican place. The presentation is good they really do look edible but its not Mexican food thats for sure. I did not finish my Alpastor & Baja Fish tacos I could not eat them.   Its a shame that these people didn't go with the real thing in a location that its perfect for it.  Surrounded by bars, hotels, office buildings, the heart of PHX and not take advantage by offering one of the best things AZ has, being so close to the border. If you dont know PHX and you always wanted to try a real taco Do Not go Here. We have plenty of other places that are near this place. Not worth it for me.",

What is holding me back is the value for the money. 2 tacos and one ceviche were $25.00 with only water ($30.00 with tip) and the food was ok but,in a town with so many taco choices, it did not stand out.   I hope the owners read all the yelp reviews and make some adjustments as I would rather support local.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. I followed and waited for this restaurant to open for months. Maybe I just had high expectations. The atmosphere/ vibe I loved. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. It had that chic urban vibe that I love about Downtown Phoenix. The nichie nachos as my appetizer was really good. I ordered the pork verde as my entree and it was bland. I don't think in my entire life I have ever said that about food inspired by Mexican cuisine. It wasn't horrible nor great either. The chips and salsa they served were ok. They heavily salted the chips where it wasn't enjoyable to eat more than 5 chips. I asked the waiter if they could not salt the chips but he said he couldn't accomadate that. I think the most disappointing thing was their salsa. I am Mexican American and I grew up with Mexican food my entire life. I feel like salsa is like the most important part about Mexican food. I tried the Roja and Montezuma salsa and they were ok. Nothing really special about them. I had a couple of cocktails and they were good, but not great. The decor of the restaurant didn't fit my aesthetic. The lawn chair looking tables with the \"Mexican blanket\" design looked campy/cheesy as well as the roosters everywhere. Apart me can't help but feel a tiny bit offended/eyes rolling in the back of my head. I was hoping this place would be an elevated, urban, chic restaurant that combined traditional and new cuisine concepts to the forefront of how we view Mexican food. It does sort of give off that impression, but it missed the mark. I will go back because I want to try other items and maybe my mind will be swayed to up my stars on my review.",

He brought me a normal margarita instead of the mango one I ordered and then tried to explain that their margaritas were made fresh with not mango puree but with mango liquor.  Huh?  It was very apparent that he didn't like when I sent it back.  The ceviche was pretty much a soup with a few shrimp.  My husband (who looooves ceviche and will pretty much eat anything) wouldn't even eat the dish.  The trio appetizer was okay, but the salsa was sweet....almost like they used canned tomatoes.  We ended up having to grab the other waiters and the bartender a few times because our waiter was so ungodly slow.  He hated us. For the first time in our lives, we didn't tip...it was that unpleasant.  I'm bummed, I had such high hopes for this place because of all the great reviews. We definitely won't return.",

However, the poor customer service and the attitude of the workers just ruined the whole experience. We had made a reservation for 4 but showed up about 15 mins early. We checked in and the host seemed unhappy we were early but we went to the bar-- no problem. I went back in at our check in time to the host and was seriously ignored for like 5 minutes. I tried to maintain a positive attitude but the waiter was very short and belittled the worker who served me my food. Still tried to maintain positivity, but the icing on the cake was when we tried to explain that we wanted our bill split by couple (there were just 2 couples) and he got so angry! Like legitimately angry. Food was delicious but the workers ruined it for us. Maybe we came at a bad time but we won't be back.",

Not only that but they made a \"3-bean ceviche\" which was on point. The margaritas are made right-- without sweet and sour or loads of sugar. I also had the grass-fed Carne Asada platter!  Amazing! I tried the in-house made salsas and guacamole. So good!!! Their Pinot Grigio wine-- the \"house\" was also wonderful. I did not try my friends' entrees but they were raving about them. I love that we have an upscale, authentic, food and non-foodie friendly, gluten-free friendly, and creative Mexican restaurant downtown!!!! About time. Let us hope that Phoenix keeps this place going as it is surrounded by multiple fast-food and corporate restaurant chains. It is a gem!",

Good was terrific. One complaint. Limes. Prepping limes for garnish at a Mexican restaurant is a big deal since they are used for everything. I ordered a Bohemia draft beer that was garnished with a lime wedge. Squeezing the lime yielded nothing. How old are limes that have no juice? The cut edges of the rind were brown, indicating the lime was probably cut the day before. Not a big deal but it does make you wonder what other shortcuts have been taken. Overall good meal.

They take reservations so we were immediately seated at 5pm.  The food was good we started with their award winning guacamole which was fantastic!  We also took advantage of their happy hour menu that they serve til 6pm. From that menu we ordered the street corn, hummus and ceviche. They were fairly good but the guac was the winner. I ordered the shrimp diablo and it had great flavor!  My wife ordered the charred cauliflower which was very tasty as well.

We came here because the reviews were great; what a disappointment. All the reviews were raving about the carne asada so that's what I got for my main dish; it was well cooked, however had no seasoning at all. The dish comes with cherry tomatoes, onion, guacamole, charro beans, and blue corn tortilllas. Nothing was seasoned, you couldn't taste anything in the charro beans (they looked more like refried beans' color) and no chorizo taste. The grilled cherry tomatoes tasted like vinegar (not a pleasant taste) and honestly it was the most bland meal I've had in a while. My fiance had the chimichanga which besides being crispy, it also lacked flavor. All in all, a very expensive disappointing dinner.",

Any physical exertion is sufficient for me to justify eating, so I insisted we get food, and we decided on Chico Malo because I liked the hip decor and patio seating and he liked that football was playing on the TVs above the bar. We ordered the salsas roja and verde with chips and an elote to share.  The salsa roja tasted more like marinara than it should've, and the chips were incredibly salty (I wiped every chip off on my napkin before eating, which made them perfect) but everything else totally hit the spot. Pro Tip: Cut the kernels off the cob and scoop up with the chips.",

    "text": "In Phoenix for a much overdue and needed weekend of MLB - my Nationals are in town and it's a quick trip down here to see them from my new hometown of Las Vegas.  Without vehicle and not wanting to spend a fortune on transportation I've been eating downtown. So far nothing has been particularly outstanding and I'd kinda given up. Chico Malo was close by and I figured I'd give it a try.   First - you have to start with the service which got the experience started off on the right foot.  I sat at the bar outside and was immediately greeted with a big smile and hello from Joe. He introduced the other bartender and let me know that either one of them could help me with anything.  Sometimes traveling solo you don't feel particularly welcome eating solo at the bar - but this guy was super friendly and welcoming.   I was offered a cold beer or a drink.  It's Sunday brunch so I felt obligated to get at least one mimosa - which was made with fresh squeezed orange juice. I also ordered the trio - a bean ceviche, red salsa, and guacamole. At $12 it's a little pricey considering one of the 3 bowls is salsa and frequently Mexican restaurants include chips and salsa for free, but the bean ceviche was really tasty and I didn't need any salt for the guacamole (which is pretty rare for me).    While eating my appetizer I was asked if I had any questions about the menu - which I did - and Joe answered them all confidently and helped steer me to the Chingon Burrito.  My drink was also empty and I decided to switch to a sangria.  I was offered white or red - complete with a description of both so I didn't order one I would t like. Ended up with the white - made with pineapple and fresh mint - which was perfectly refreshing for the warm Phoenix weather.   Now for the food:  You have to admire a menu item that announces its fantastic-ness in its own name - The Chingon Burrito. Filled with what must be multiple pounds of carne asada, ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese, this burrito is then topped with 2 eggs and it is definitely Chingon!  Served with perfectly seasoned puerco beans and fingerling potatoes this is a meal that will feed any appetite.  No one will ever leave here hungry.  Ever.   There was one small problem with my burrito - I asked for over medium eggs instead of sunny side up but I got two eggs fried totally hard.  Someday I'll learn to trust the chef, but in the meantime sunny side up eggs kinda gross me out. In all fairness, the place only serves brunch on Sunday so there's not a lot of practice with eggs and it's not as easy as everyone thinks. You might think this would cause a 1 star-deduction, but the service more than made up for it.  Within 2 bites the guys were over to check on my food.  I showed them the eggs and before I knew it fresh over-medium eggs were delivered.  Great service, quick follow up, and a proper recook are all anyone can ask for because no one is perfect. For these reasons - no star penalties will be issued.   Some general comments:   - everything tasted good and it's the first meal I've had in town where the hot food was actually hot.  Thank you! - no salt and pepper on the tables or bar because it's not needed.  Even the over easy eggs are perfectly seasoned with a little salt and cracked black pepper prior to service.  You have to appreciate a kitchen with confidence. - the burrito is enough food for two or three people; pace yourself because it tastes so good you're going to want to try and keep eating.  - the place is comfortable - cool decor without being overly pretentious  - I also like to observe others in my reviews and see a lot of happy people enjoying their food. I can't speak for these folks, but seeing them all reinforces my experience.   My final analysis:  great experience and great food. I will definitely be back here when my travels bring me to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Oh yeah! Had a very surprising experience in Phoenix during my recent visit. \"Bad boy\" is bad to the lamb bone. Probably on the slightly pricier side for Phoenix, this hip gastropub is in a renovated downtown and is a great value for the food (for an out of towner).   We had a shockingly fresh ceviche (don't forget you're in the desert), some tasty beers (Mexican \"hefeweisen\" was great), and tasty tacos, leg of lamb and sides. Friendly, polite service, a great atmosphere, and amenities like the football game without being an overbearing sports bar were appreciated.   The coconut rice side was fantastic, but arrived a bit cool: would have been nice if it was at least warmed, and the al pastor was not particularly tender (usually it's a much fattier cut of steak). These small adjustments were the only complaints I could come up with, as a dedicated life-long pessimist.  Tempted to return on my second night in town, I passed but will happily keep it on the shortlist when staying downtown.  PS, somehow they fit a real ice rink next to it, so if in season, it would make a great date spot!",

    "text": "On Easter Sunday, I was expecting huge crowds or a line for brunch and I was happy to see that there was no wait!  Woohoo!  I wanted to show my visiting guests what DT had to offer and chose this restaurant based that it was walking distance from my church.  They were visiting from CA and it was their first time in DT Phoenix.    We were welcomed by their friendly staff at the door and seated quickly.  Our waiter went over the menu and was attentive.  We asked the waiter if he spoke Spanish since some of the menu items are Mexican dishes with a South American twist.  He politely said it was not good but was trying his hardest and my guests appreciated his efforts.  He made us feel extremely welcomed and made for a very positive experience.  We ordered the Drunken French Toast, Chilaquiles, Breakfast Quesadilla and the Simple Breakfast.  Also had appetizers and drinks!  My french toast was hard to eat.  I could eat the caramelized banana all day though, but make it a bit less complicated.  The Chilaquiles were the bomb!  Although it was not what I ordered, the green chili pork was perfect.  Everyone else was very pleased with what they ordered and the bloody Mary's kept coming!  I couldn't try everything so I'm definitely returning for more.  You know you're at the right place when you walk in and to your left is a mural art of Frida Kahlo flashing gang signs with some lucha libre.  The venue has clever decor and murals are vibrant.  Overall, we had an exceptional experience with the service and food.",

    "text": "Such Guc-a-love.   So I see this place across from my Hotel. It's Phoenix, they gotta have good Mexican.  Chico is a nouveau Mexican style place.  I take a chance, ironically the name of my waiter, such a fun, happy, go lucky guy whom lived up to his name and walked away with a 25% tip for great service.  You sold this place man, and there was a dedication. Now to warm you... this isn't your hole in the wall taco place and it isn't cheap... but well worth it.   So I got the guac.. my tableside experience consisted of a more traditional and the a modern and sweeter guac.  I saw another review whom hated the sweet aspect. It's different then traditional but a journey you should take.  If nouveau Mexican is sweet... viva la Mexico!!!   I rounded that off with a ceviche, also sweet with watermelon and the duck taco with a mole sauce.   All good.  An expensive $5 taco for sure, but full of flavor, well put together, and worth the price.   Dessert was a chili / pineapple / strawberry custard. Beautiful presentation and great taste. Spice at the dessert menu is a new thing for me, but fun And exciting, like breakfast for dinner or rock climbing.   Downed this with a prickly pear iced tea that I promptly spilled all over the table... the second glass was good though.    Overall... great food, caring and dedicated service invested in your dining experience, and a good night.  4 stars because I had so little of the menu.  Knocking out a few more tacos and I'll be up to 5.",

The food isn't terrible, just mediocre and hilariously over priced. I paid $10 for two small street taco al pastor tacos. They don't come with anything, no rice, no drink, no elote, nothing. The tacos were fine, though the tortillas were a bit dry and the Al Pastor was a bit fatty.  You'd think being in cityscape they'd be catering to lunch time office workers, but they don't seem to be. Getting food for pickup was slow, even though the place was 1/2 empty at 12:30. I asked if they had fountain soda to go, they did not. They have coke in bottles, which is fine, but I assume I'm like most non alcoholics and I don't keep a bottle opener at my desk.  This place is a huge missed opportunity. All told, it's a definite downgrade from the Chloes salad bar that was once housed in this space.",

It felt like we were in a restaurant in Vegas rather than just downtown Phoenix.   Our table started off with the Montezuma chips and salsa. I'm a total chicken when it comes to spice, but the salsa was so good I kept on eating even though my mouth was on fire. The chips were fresh and still warm when they got to table, which is always appreciated. I had the duck carnitas, pork belly and the short rib tacos. Definitely do the pork belly! My friend loved her crispy avocado tacos.   Their drink menu is quite unique and it'll be fun to go back and try more. Our table had the Bolo de Coco (do this if you're a fan of coconut and banana), a margarita on the rocks with pineapple, La Calavera (huge shared drink) and the Loma Bonita, which was my favorite. The grapefruit soda in this was perfect - tart, fizzy and full flavored.   I'll update the review after a few more visits to get the full experience. Next time I want to try the elote, pork belly tostada and anticuchos.",

    "text": "I saw an article about Chico Malo online when it opened and had patiently been waiting to go on my next visit to the desert. Being from California, some might say we're snobby with our Mexican food. However, I prefer the term connoisseur, but I digress...That's all to say I was highly anticipating my visit and it did not disappoint!  I went with a group of seven, which was great because we got to try a lot of the menu -- both food and drinks. Everything was fantastic, but some absolute standouts were the queso fundido, short ribs, churro bread pudding, and the alebrije.   The space is amazing. The designer truly took her time to plan out an inviting and unique space. I especially loved the rotating roosters and back wall of books!   If I lived closer I would be a regular, but until then I'll keep looking forward to meals at Chico Malo when I'm in town.",

The tiny overpriced tacos are not to die for totally not worth it.         Who wants to spent 30$ for 5 mini 4inch tiny taquitos.  Umm this place  will not be one of my fav sorry..",

If you're looking for a \"basic\"Mexican food experience - this is not your restaurant.  You won't find enchiladas or Tex-mex fajitas.  Instead it's traditional plates that have been jazzed up.  Definitely try the margs.  They aren't drowned in sweet and sour.  If you have some time - get the story about the art from one of the visually appealing management staff.  If you're on a date - this place seals the deal every time.",

Our preferred res. time wasn't open but 15 min later was, so we took that one but arrived and made it as clear as possible we had theater tickets and needed to order drinks/app/dinner at once so we could be on time. About 45 min later food arrived, at this point we'd already settled checks. We shoveled a few bites in and started getting up from the table.  The manager came over before we left, he reversed the charges on our cards, sincerely apologized for the kitchen delay and that is why we will return, and take our time to enjoy the food. The bites I had of the Whole fish were delicious.  The white sangria was good, better than my friends red sangria I thought. And the guacamole we had as appetizer was awesome.   Our waitress was fantastic and sweet.",

It was cold and our waiter took forever to serve us. Plus he was rude to our two year old daughter. They don't have a kids menu so I had to order my daughter a $6 taco so she could have something to eat of her own.  My husband also observed our waiter \"lightly\" wash his hands (no soap) and proceeded to open the door with his bare hands. Yuck!   My second visit was with friends. I hoped our experience would be better. We arrived 45 minutes before close and didn't receive a menu for 7 minuets after being seated. We ordered beers and then watched as the staff stood around and chatted. After 10 minutes my girlfriend asked our waiter if our drinks where poured yet. He rudely replied \"no.\" We then excused ourselves and he abruptly replied \"cool\" as if he didn't want us there anyway. I'm so disappointed with the poor customer service. We won't be returning.",

Chico Malo tops it all with amazing fresh ingredients.  They are so fresh I swear they must get it from the farmer the day they are picked.   The guacamole is to die for.   Chips are very fresh and have that perfect crunch to them.   The salsa has just the right amount of heat and yum! The first time I came I had the grass fed carne Asada.   Super tasty, perfectly cooked and the tortillas on the side were great.  Second trip, I had the rib eye steak!! Wow.  $34.99 for a 16 oz ribeye with chimchuri sauce and potatoes and veggies.  Wow wow so good mouth watering steak perfectly cooked.  Also tried the elote and I love how they get the corn off the cob for you so you don't have to eat like a savage.  3rd trip I had the pozolle.   Wow.  Wow. So full of flavor and mouth watering.  Finally my last trip I had 3 tacos and the chips and half order of guacamole.  Delicious of course.  I loved the fried avocado taco!! The service was on point each time and if you can go somewhere 4 times in one week and have it be this consistent you know they are doing something right.  Can you please open one in San Diego now?!",

They have an indoor and outdoor bar which is great. If you come here you must order the table side guacamole! They make it fresh with all the ingredients that you want. It was super good and wish I could have it every day! The tacos here are super good especially with the pineapple which made it that much more mouthwatering! The restaurant is located downtown area of AZ and next door to CVS. Parking may be a bit tricky since it is downtown and next to businesses but not impossible to find parking. Overall a great experience and will definitely come back again when in the area!",

Sadly, I did not try the food, my date for the night was not \"hungry\"....But I was not leaving without trying something. So, I had drinks....I tried the Oaxacan.... I honestly don't remember what is in it but it was about a triple shot tequila and some other liquors that made the tequila bitterness taste sweet. I did glance at the menu and was dissapointed to not see other but 1 taco option.  The ambience was chill, it's a big space the tables are well spaced, the decor is nice. The only down fall was that I was there was absolutely 0 tp in the bathroom. And it was full lots of ladies in there, thankfully they had paper towels to dry your hands which everyone was taking....however. this posed a problem because there were no trash cans in there and flushing down the toilet would have clogged it. It happened... not to me but the stall next to mine. Slight overlook on the maintenance crew, probably cost the restaurant some money....regardless of that the bathrooms were clean.",

    "text": "Come the fuck on.  After experiencing the trash heap of disappointment that was Taco Guild earlier in the day, my wife and I went and drank our sorrows away around town, depressed that we didn't get a decent taco in a city filled with amazing tacos.  While drinking, we met a man who said he tended bar at Chico Malo, and told him about how shitty Taco Guild was.  He agreed and told us to go to Chico Malo and try it, that we wouldn't be disappointed, that they make amazing tacos the right way, tacos that will blow your mind.  After a few hours we had worked up a hunger and said \"Screw it. Let's go get some better tacos.\"  The space is nice and open, indoor/outdoor bar is long and accommodating, it just feels more accessible than when it was The Corner.  We had some hopes because it was obvious the owners spent money on this joint.    We ordered 3 tacos, I think it was the chicken tinga, the chorizo y papas and the crispy avocado.  They came out after a while on fresh made corn tortillas!  Then I went to take a bite of the chicken tinga...but first I had to remove the dill fronds from the top.  Seriously.  They put dill fronds on a taco.  Then I was mad.  It was sweet.  SWEET.  What the shit?  Ok, I thought, at least I ordered chorizo and potatoes, there's no way to fuck that up with sweetness.  I had had enough sweet bullshit tacos at Taco Guild, I needed something savory for once.  I don't know what the hell it is with these pseudo-taco places obviously pandering to white people, but they seem to believe that white people want nothing but sweet food.  White people, I don't know if that's True about you or not, but according to Taco Guild and Chico Malo, you're basically pure sugar.  Anyway, I bit into the chorizo y papa taco!    IT'S SWEET.   Turns out they have a \"jalapeno marmalade\".  Because yeah, that's exactly what the perfect combination of chorizo and potato was missing:  marmalade.  You motherfuckers.  The crispy avocado taco was probably the best one but even that was kind of overloaded with cucumber, maybe more of a personal preference, but even without that it would have been completely forgettable.  I left this place in a hurry, mad and upset that I broke the cardinal taco rule TWICE in one day:  the nicer the place, the shittier the taco.  PS: These mofos have a carne asada taco with ENGLISH PEA GUACAMOLE.  God damnit.  Seriously, fuck you.  Why not just go buttfuck my dead grandmother in the grave with more of your jalapeno marmalade while you're out desecrating hispanic things?    But I'm still nice and gave two stars because it's a nice place!  But I still hate you and your tacos, Chico Malo.     PPS:  The tacos are $5 a piece.  I'm not cheap either, so I usually don't give a shit if something is higher priced than it should be so long as I'm getting something fantastic for that price.  Instead I got trash heap fusion food from some dickbag conglomerate of corporate food-thinkers that probably cobbled this menu together from a list of foodie buzzwords and kitschy trend-aggregator instagram accounts or something.

    "text": "Disappointing.  This place received so much hype prior to opening and it severely under delivered.  The food is less than great and way too expensive for what it is.  For starters, $5 for mediocre tacos, $12 for a Pastor torta that doesn't really taste like Pastor, and $5 for a Mexican Coke.  I mean, c'mon.  This place demands a price on its menu that is not worth the quality (or lack thereof) that they deliver.  Just the food quality and price warrants never visiting this place again.  Service: Here is the real deal breaker.  A group of 10 friends and I decided to go here for lunch.  We made a reservation and were sat promptly.  Everything else that followed was a disaster.  Food came out out of order and not complete.  One of the people in our group received 1 taco before the waiter informed us that the rest of their order was lost in between the table and sending it into the kitchen.  This happened to 3 people in our group.  The end result was that some of us received our food close to 45 minutes before other received theirs.  After the mass confusion regarding the food order, the checks were incorrect and had to be corrected multiple times before we received our correct bills.  This place looks nice and the owners clearly invested a lot of money in the place.  However, that is the extent of nice things that I can say about Chico Malo.  The food is not memorable and the service was absolutely awful.  Our group of 10 unanimously decided that this place will not get a revisit (in addition to 5 other co-workers that visited just a few days before).",

    "text": "As the restaurant is in City Scape, one would anticipate that it would be accommodating to the surrounding business professionals during lunch; unfortunately, this is not the case. My co-workers and I went to the restaurant as a group of six, and we were quoted a wait time of fifteen minutes. After a review of the menu and a twenty minute wait, two of our party left.  We updated the hostess that we were now a group of four, and we were told that they were actively readying our table. We waited five more minutes, and asked the hostess again when we would be seated.  We were told that we were next on the list.  Two more tables were then seated before we were. We then approached the hostess stand to let them know that we planned to go elsewhere, and we were then seated after just over twenty-five minutes of waiting.  The server was very prompt in greeting us and asking if we had any questions on the menu.  We ordered and got our food after about twenty minutes.  The gal who ordered the Caesar salad received a plate with three small clusters of lettuce.  It was appealing to the eye, but the portion size left her hungry at the end of the meal.  The gal who ordered black beans received refried (not specified in the menu) black beans.  The flavor and texture left a lot to be desired, and the beans were sent back and removed from the bill.  The final two gals ordered the nachos.  They were pleased with the flavor of the nachos; however, the dish did not actually contain a chip or nacho of any kind.  All-in-all, wait time was longer than anticipated, and the hostess stand was quite unorganized. The food tasted good for the most part, but the menu description did not match what was received for any of the ordered dishes. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, and the service was good.   We concluded at the end of our meal that this restaurant would serve best as a happy hour location with co-workers after a long day/week of work. We recommend ordering only the chips and salsa, as these actually appeared to be chips and salsa. Also, the regular drink menu and happy hour menu had some excellent options; although, the actual timing of happy hour can't be found on any of the menus.",

I got tacos al pastor and it even has tiny pieces of pineapple that add that much more flavor, the tortillas seemed homemade, which makes it even better. I was very hesitant when I walked in, because we've been to many Mexican restaurants and they don't taste authentic at all but this place did not disappoint. Only thing is that they don't have corona, but our waiter recommended a Bohemia beer, and it was really good. Definitely worth the time and price.",

I tried the Chile Colorado tonight and I was completely impressed... Having worked in Mexican Food for many years, I can attest that this recipe is legit. The Red Chile was flavorful and adequately spiced... a dish that good needs a better tortilla though... I will ask for the Al Pastor tortillas tonight!!  Speaking of Al Pastor, OMG my lovely bride loved her Tacos!! Excellent job!!  We are heading back downtown tonight for the Eagles Concert and we may have to revisit this gem!!!   Cheers!!",

The desk clerk at the hotel recommended this as one of his favorites and did not lead us astray.  Lots of options, all different from the average Mexican menu options.  We started with house made guacamole and chips, excellent.  Lots of chunks of avocado and not doctored with a bunch of extra stuff.  Chips were crisp and fresh.  I had friend avocado tacos which are street taco size which is perfect for me.  Had a lovely spicy home made sauce, yum.  Added some black beans which I didn't need but tasted amazing.  My friend had Chicken Ancticuhco which sounds odd but she said was amazing.  She also had a side of corn on the cob called Elote which sounded horrible with mayo and spices but tasted really yummy.  Of course we had no room for dessert  Our server was amazing and had lots of ideas of places we should see while there and restaurants we should try.  My only complaint was it was pretty dark and the menu print exceedingly small so I had to use my phone's flashlight to read it.    If you're staying downtown, or attending a function, certainly worth a stop",

The scallops were sandy, as in sand. While this is not unusual, these scallops were inedible. We were picking sand out of our teeth for the rest of the night. The scallops were also undercooked, which we sent back to be  finished. Finally, we had the Lobster Chili Rellenos which was cold.  Over all, we spent $160(tip included).

    "text": "My life problem with coming here was that I wanted traditional Mexican food, but I was walking around at 2:30pm, which is closing time for many Mom-and-pop Mexicans places in downtown. I eventually made my way to Chico Malo with my friend and had a solid experience.  The restaurant is located in the CityScape, so it has a decent amount of competition bringing people in. Therefore, we had no problems getting two spots in the outdoor section of the bar.   I insisted upon starting off with guac, but my friend hates it. (I know I know...I low key hate him for his disdain of avocados, but I digress.) we ended up getting the trip, which included the bean salad and salsa as well as the guac. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and the presentation of the drip trio - if you have read my review of Lachey's in Cincinnati, you know my bad luck regarding dip trios. I munched hard on the dip trio here, and I was having a lot of fun mixing and matching the different dips. They complement each other well and are great starters for your entrees.  We were happy to hear that they were still serving brunch options until 3, so we both opted for items off of that menu. I ordered Chile Rellenos while my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. My Rellenos came out HUGE. It was just a massive amount of food. Unfortunately, soggy chips do not make great leftovers and I found the verde to be rather flavorless. Luckily I had salsa and guac left to help me eat. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his eggs Benedict and it was actually a normal eating amount, so ya know, I was happy for him.  All in all, a solid option in downtown Phoenix, but if the choice arises, maybe get some authentic tacos elsewhere first.",

The margaritas were underwhelming and the waitress snatched one of them from our table that was still 1/3 full. The food was just ok, meaning none of our 3 meals were remotely impressive. Consensus 2 star experience, and I rate everything highly. For the price of this place, go eat 3 times at a good Mexican dining establishment. The 2 stars I did give were the result of the great music. Keep it up dj! Keep trying chef.",

My fiance and I went to have a early dinner we had a total of 6 tacos and a appetizer. Crispy avacodo, Baja fish, Pastor, Chicken Tinga, and papas and chorizo were amaizing, the only one I didn't like was the Carne Asada taco. The taco had great toppings and all blended well, my favorite thing to do when I have tacos is tak a piece of the protein and taste it, always done that. In this case the Carne Asada was bland no taste seemed like no seasoning (nope not even salt and pepper) seems like they wanted to mask the bland beef with all the ingredients in the taco but didn't end up working out. The chorizo con Papas appetizer was really good but prefer it as a taco instead. Overall a great place to have dinner and drinks! Recommended!",

Elote was awesome - huge cob of corn with the perfect balance of flavors and a tiny bit of kick. Duck tamale was okay - it was huge, but had very little duck and the flavors were a bit muted. Pozole was delicious - flavorful, well-stocked with the ingredients described, and perfect balance of meat and fat. White sangria was okay - I'd get something else next time.  All that said, I'd return and try other dishes, and would order the elote again for sure!",

They were frequently sitting in booths with friends, chatting with each other at the host stand, and talking with the bartender instead of paying attention to their tables.  At one point, we saw our server sitting on the patio and took a drink from one of his friends cocktails - while we waited 10+ minutes for our second round of drinks.  The server gave attitude when someone in our party asked him to describe a dish prior to ordering.  Sad to know that the service ruined a good food experience.  I will think twice before I consider returning.",

Even though there was an event downtown tonight, Chico Malo got us a table quickly!  We started with white sangria (holy yum!!) and then moved on to margaritas and the Paloma!  Again, DELICIOUS and strong cocktails!   I don't do cilantro, so not only did they make the guacamole without it, the quesadilla usually comes with a mole (with cilantro) on the plate. They even put that on the side for us!!!  The elote was terrific and all of the food was fast and hot! The best part about our visit though was the service!!!  As we sat at our table, multiple servers came by to check on us... even though we weren't \"their\" table!  Mario came by a few times and always had a huge smile and was so so helpful and friendly!  What a wonderful human to employ!  Our server, Nate, took the cake!  He was attentive and funny and friendly and he just made us feel so welcome!  He didn't miss a beat with our order or weird food needs !   Nate really made this place move from 4 to 5 stars!!  Thank you, Chico Malo, for a wonderful night!!!",

We had visited 2 other restaurants already, scouting new places. Myself as a business owner of a marketing and social media company,  and a friend of mine who is also a  business owner and client of mine, and our ladies. We were seated in the waiting area, the ladies had to use the restroom, then a few others sat next to us  waiting. A hostess brought them menus to look over but not us. Which was not a huge deal. Then we were seated 5 min later, we assessed the ac unit which was really hot in the entire establishment. When you have brick and glass windows in Az, it heats up and holds heat a lot  more than stucco. You need to turn it up in the summer. Then after we reached the table, we waited for 10 min, water was on the table, yet no server came to us. They checked on the table next to us, but not us. Now, at first some may think that this is a fluke, but we could not help but think this is due to race. A black and Asian man, a Mexican man, and two Caucasian sisters, all dressed appropriately, well spoken, and just looking for a double date night out, in this day and age, it sucks. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Had dinner with a friend a few nights ago and this place is ok, with potential, but lacking in certain areas that I will detail below. Wish I could give it 2.5 stars, but c'est la vie.  The takeaway: if you want to check it out once because you are that curious and have nowhere else to go, sure. Otherwise you're better off spending a 100 dollars somewhere else.  The Good:  Drinks  Tried 4 different types of the cocktails from the menu and they were flavorful. The margarita mix they used is too sweet for my tastes, but I tend to like my drinks more on the sour side. That is, however, the only complaint I have about the drink.  The O.K.:  Food  The chips were bland, and almost off putting. If you're going to get the chips, you NEED the salsa. Try it without the Salsa at your own risk.  Got the shrimp tacos and all the toppings were good, but the shrimp were overcooked. The avocado sauce was good, but as a Mexican restaurant that should be a given, not something you get extra points for (unless it's amazing, and this wasn't that).  I wish I had the experience others did with the food.  The definitely needs improvement:  The Service. So. I don't know what to say besides a well trained staff makes the restaurant and a poorly trained staff kills it. The staff here need better training from management.  Let's start with the host. Friendly-ish is not the standard you are supposed to be welcoming. I know it's loud, but that's not my fault so don't get annoyed if you can't hear me right away. Also pro-tip, if there is a wait time longer than 30 minutes, you should immediately recommend drinks at the bar with a tab that can be transferred. I shouldn't have to ask you if those are options.  The bartender. The dude serving there mixed well enough, but his check-ins were non existent. I didn't buy more drinks because he didn't check-in often enough, and I wasn't going to struggle to flag him down.  The waitress. So my friend has a food allergy that we explicitly told the waitress. Twice. Ceviche comes and it's laying on top of avocado slices. Lucky my friend noticed before she digged in. You can kill someone by being THAT careless. Just remember that. They took the plate away and I canceled the order as I didn't want to risk the cooks just scraping the ceviche off and putting it another plate (yes, some restaurants do that), but you should either offer something complimentary for the mistake or have the manager over and apologize. I was so pissed off, I just wanted to leave immediately, but we were both too hungry.  And that's it! Enjoy at your own risk! (Joking, but seriously check your plate before you dig in)",

I have a tomato allergy (super hard to avoid at Mexican restaurants), but he had our guac made without it, and my meal had no tomatoes.   The tacos I got were served SO beautifully, and they were delicious! My husband got the green chili chicken and loved it. Service was quick, attentive, and helpful. After our meal, the manager came over we had a great conversation, and he bought us dessert.   We would come back here for dinner in a heartbeat. Their unique menu, fun atmosphere, and quick, friendly service are worth returning for.",

The service is extremely quick even when the restaurant is busy. The drinks are always mixed perfectly, and the food is always great.

I think it equaled about one ear of corn...$7 is steep for an ear of corn (and I should know because I'm an ex-Nebraskan). All in all, it's a solid date night place...the green chile chicken and corn tortillas was scrumptious.",

I had a bomb cocktail called a Loma bonita they make grapefruit soda in house and used that and garnished it with a edible flower making it look beautiful like the name. I had a pork verde that melted in my mouth and came with a green sauce and tortillas my roommate had a few tacos he said the duck carnitas was his favorite along with the avocado taco. Now the look and ambiance was something out of a art show with several different art instillation throughout the building that the staff was more then willing to explain. Fun fact the light fixtures are sourced locally from HINKLEYS a local LIGHT fixture company.",

The place is new and very cool inside. Similar vibe to the Copper Blues above it.   The service was a bit slow. Again not many people at the bar so this was surprising. That said, the food I had, was really good! I had the Carne Asada taco and the Pollo Tinga taco. The presentation was very nice and each was very pleasant to look at. But the taste was even better! Both were very flavorful and the meats on both were tender and juicy. I could have eaten 3 or 4 easy. But kept it to two as the price is on the upper side for the size compared to other similar places in the downtown area nearby.   Overall, a very good experience. If you are hungry, order more than 2.  But would be a fun place at night to eat before or after the comedy club. Recommended and I'll be back.",

Definitely worth a try, would absolutely go again. Nice place for a cocktail, a couple tacos, or just to eat their salsa which was freakin delicious and creative. Go to Chico Malo!",

It is in the hip downtown area and I was instantly impressed by the decor. Very fun and lives up to its name. Started with guacamole which is so big! Seemed never ending but in a good way. Next was the shrimp diablo and al pastor tacos, which were so fresh and flavorful. They were on corn tortillas I think and were just perfect. Three in each order which was enough between 2 people. For fun we also go the street corn (off the cob) and the quesadilla. Both delicious cheesy flavors!  For drinks we just had the margs (mine with sugar rim). Thought they were great! I recommend getting reservations a week or so in advance. It's not possible earlier than that but keep an eye on opentable!",

The guacamole was tasteless. The design was nice but the noise level was a minus. The food was tasty.

    "text": "Not even embarrassed to admit that we went here for lunch and immediately decided to return for dinner. For lunch (technically Brunch on Sunday)  we started with the shrimp ceviche. This was not served with chips, which surprised us at first- but we quickly realized we didn't need them. The watermelon in this dish was a surprising and refreshing addition. I could have eaten 3 of these to my self. My husband and I ordered the Pozole (a Mexican soup/stew) and the Al Pastor tacos. Both were excellent, but the Pozole stole the show. The broth was INCREDIBLE. It's very filling with succulent morsels of pork and of course gooey cheese. It's served with fresh homemade tortillas that are so freaking good. I loved the pork in the tacos, great texture. We also had margaritas- which were very strong! Lol   We returned later for happy hour / dinner and sat at the bar. The happy hour menu is small, but sufficient. They only offer two wine options total (on regular menu too) and the white was a blend that was heavy on the chard (per the bartender). So I went with another marg and learned they are in fact draft margs. I was annoyed at first, but I'm sure they are homemade still- just premade! This round wasn't as strong as lunch, but still delicious. We ordered the HH appetizer shrimp ceviche tostada for another taste of that! We also ordered the vegetable tamale and the leg of lamb of dinner. We were quite full by the time the lamb came, but somehow we managed to eat most it- it was huge! And we didn't even break the bank for dinner, all very reasonably priced. 4 drinks, two apps and one entree all for about $75. Would definitely return next time we are in Phoenix.",

We arrived in the later afternoon, so we got right in and our food came fast. Our server was very friendly and personal and the ambiance was incredible. Sidenote: I want whoever did the interior work here to design my house, it was so beautiful. We ordered the Trio to start and holy-guacamole it was a good way to begin the meal. Next, we shared the diablo shrimp tacos, the al pastor tacos, and the Green Chili Chicken. All were incredible and so flavorful. The sides of the elote were also a hit and I think I'll be craving that corn for a while. It really was so delicious and lived up to the statement on their website of being unapologetically bold and flavorful. Also, the price was very reasonable for the quality of food and the ambiance. If I was local, I'd eat here regularly.  The only question I have is how do I get them to open a location in  Salt Lake City, Utah?",

I do however,  prefer to have a menu that I know what I'm eating. I chose the avocado tacos, while my son got the chimichanga. We did share the elote as an appetizer. That was amazingly gooood. Really good. My tacos were good. Not the best tacos I've had. The chimmy, was really good. Sauce was mild. I'll consider this place a stop.

Their rossted pepers and roasted green tomato-based green salsa is far better than rossted red tomato-based red salsa. Their Habernero sauce is excuisite. BUT of you like hot, go for their ghost peper sauce. All three of their hot sauces (Habernero sauce, ghost peper sauce and their hot yellow sauce that has mango in it) are in tiny \"dropper\" bottles. You have to use dropper to squeeze and few drops of any of their three hot sauces in your food.",

The hostess was super sweet and our server Thomas was phenomenal. He made exquisite recommendations and was able to handle the billion and one questions my family asked. My dad is a bit of a foodie and asked specific questions in regard to the ingredients and Thomas was a pro and explained the background and reasons to each pairing of foods. I had the pork verde per Thomas recommendation and I was unapologeticly pleased. The dish was bold and flavorful and the pork just fell apart beautifully mixed with the divine green sauce! My family each had a different dish as we love to try a bit of everyone's and needless to say we cleaned our plates haha",

    "text": "I had heard from other reviews that the service at Chico Malo could be slow, so I made sure to come during a slow time, lunch on a weekday. People were still seated at the tables.  I first ordered a Cordoba Cafe, a drink I thought that was at Sips and Sweets. When I complimented Tracy, the bartender, on the drink, she said, 'Oh no that's not it!' Zach, the bartender from Sips and Sweets came out and explained to me the difference between the two drinks. The Cordoba Cafe was inspired by the traditional drinking habits of Italians. First, dine, then have an after drink. But in tune with the Mexican flavors, the fernet is sourced from Mexico, not Italy, and it's Mexican Coke in the mix as well. Most importantly for the jolt, it also features Cartel nitro coffee. I was impressed at the dedication to the authenticity of the drink, and it showed in the delicious flavors. The second drink, the one from Sips and Sweets, had burnt honey and spices in it. I encouraged Zach and Tracy to put it on the menu, it was so good that the flavors infused into the foam, amazing! Finally, my tacos came. The duck was cooked perfectly, not too crispy, and there was a pecan crunch which was new and complimentary. The pork belly was perfect, too (but how can you really mess up pork belly?), and surprisingly the crispy avocado was delectable and one of my favorites. In addition to the flavorful fare was the colorful eclectic ambience. There is an art installation of a mural made of books by JB Snyder and Tato Caraveo, and an awesome depiction of Frida when you walk in.  All in all, have to give this 5 stars for service, food and drink quality, and ambience!",

The food was inventive and well prepared. Shrimp ceviche was unique, fresh and fantastic. The Prime flat iron was the best beef I'd had all week! Cocktails are also a big part of the formula at Chico Malo with an extensive list of tequilas and very knowledgeable bartenders.

I went here with ZERO expectations of the type of Mexican food it would be. To start I gave it 3 stars because it is quite pricey, was the food worth it? I'm about 70% sure it was. I took my mother and aunty here for my mother's birthday. It was an early dinner, no trouble making a reservation or finding the place. We all ordered bebidas alcoholicas, at least that's what they were called on the menu. I got an alebrije, my mother got the paraiso tropical and my aunty got the sangria. I don't like the sweet stuff but they do, I loved my drink the smoky mezcal was paired perfectly with the hibiscus, lemon, ginger and basil. My mom loved her drink but she loves anything sweet and even mentioned after on FB how her drink had an exotic liqueur. My aunty said hers wasn't sweet enough the waiter was kind enough to bring her a packet of stevia and she said once that was added it was delicious. We got the tableside guac and got the standard mix but added mango, cotija cheese, pomegranates, corn and jicama. I definitely have had better guac at other places but it was nothing to complain about, still good. The chips were BOMB freshly made. I got an appetizer of mango + chile, it came with this red chile sauce and what seemed like some type of seeds and pomegranate. It was delish a nice twist on mango with chamoy. We all loved the tacos I got the short rib and duck, no complaints they were filled to the brim with ingredients and super tasty. Their mole was absolutely delicious on the short rib and duck.  I could've eaten 10 each of them but then I remembered each taco costs $5.  My mother got elote and shared it with my aunty, they love elote so there isn't much you can do to ruin it for them. The rest of the tacos ordered were the pastor, chorizo  and tinga. My mom didn't like how the chorizo had actual small circle sized potatoes she said they were too difficult to eat. Aside from that everyone including myself loved their tacos. We were too full to have dessert, I was very sad about this. The reason I gave 3 stars was ultimately the price and taco portion, for the amount of food you get you are paying a pretty penny. $5 for one small ish sized taco is A LOT. If you just order two tacos they would be more of an appetizer then a meal and I'm being generous when I say that. I get that these aren't your run of the mill tacos but if that's the case then my taste buds need to be blown away and not just reading fancy descriptions that blow me away.  Ambience is AMAZING. Waiter was PHENOMENAL. I happily paid for our near $100 meal and tipped the waiter a little over 20%. I think it's worth a try if you have an open mind and like to try new things.  Also next time I might try an entree.  People remember, this place is new so keep in mind they may have some kinks to work out. I most definitely think that it is better then 1 or 2 stars.  Maybe those low raters were expecting my grandmas chorizo tacos and believe me you're not going to find those here.",

The drinks are very well crafted with unique ingredients outside of your traditional sweet cocktails you might find elsewhere. They just opened so the service still seems to be finding itself, but they were all extremely friendly. The ribeye was one of the best ribeye I've ever had with a nice smokey flavor. The corn was also amazing. I've seen others on here complain about the pricing, but I'd suggest they go to Taco Bell if they are looking for super cheap tacos instead of the more artisan experience you're going to get here.",

    "text": "Checked this place out tonight and was thoroughly impressed.  Come here with the perspective of wanting Mexican food out of the ordinary and not something to satiate you in the middle or after a night of drinking.   In terms of the environment, the decor was awesome. The murals throughout the restaurant were unique and artistic especially the bookcase in the back of the restaurant. They help to bring a sense of liveliness with a Mexican influence that is lacking in downtown Phoenix.   Service was attentive with great recommendations from our server, Ben, throughout the course of the meal. Ben provided thorough descriptions of the menu items that were unfamiliar to myself and the others in my party.   Regarding the food, my party and I had the chips and salsa, a selection of tacos, the scallop entree, and the Mexican panna cotta. The salsas all had great and distinctive flavors and were complemented from the crunch and well-seasoned tortilla chips. The roja was my favorite as it had the right bit of brightness and spice. The tacos (al pastor, baja fish, and duck carnitas) were the highlight of the night. While the tacos themselves were small, they were filling and packed with flavor, especially the duck carnitas. Each taco had the right balance of richness and acidity. The tortillas were soft and hand-made in the restaurant that helps to set them apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area. The scallops were phenomenal; they were a great size and perfectly cooked. The grits served as an accompaniment is something I would order on its own as they were delicious, luscious, and creamy. The panna cotta was the perfect ending to the dinner, light, fruity, with a little bit of spice. Overall, I came here for an experience outside of regular Mexican/Tex-Mex and was wholly satisfied.   Some of the cocktails may need a deeper explanation and/or some work on, but this place has a lot of potential especially since it has just opened so recently. I look forward to returning.",

I have been to this restaurant to impress friends with my new downtown Phoenix find, celebrated both my husband's  birthday and later my adult son's, and earlier this week met with two girlfriends for an evening of catching up.  The hip mural size art work on walls is part of the experience, as is the outside patio and a beautiful bar.  The food is not really traditional Mexican, but a little more modern mix of south of the boarder flavors and the salads and guac and chips were delicious.  Everyone was happy with their food choices from salads to steak and street style tacos.  My fellow diners included small groups in business attire in for after work drinks, convention attenders at a large table with name badges still attached, and friends together out on the large patio.  The staff are very attentive. Parking is in a large garage under the building off of Jefferson St.  Two hours of parking was validated on my ticket by Chico Malo.",

As two hungry guests, we first ordered beer (it was cold!), and the guacamole (a fun novelty, and substantial portion made from 2 whole large avocados) which was brought out with salsa and warm chips and were refilled for free later during the visit. Next came the puerco beans and 3 tacos which were served on freshly made 4-5\" tortillas: The al pastor, pollo tinga, and chorizo y papas. I personally loved the unique touches on each taco...jalapeno marmalade, egg crema, pineapple...which I felt matched the artfulness of the atmosphere and the eye-catching menu design.

Dinner was coconut rice and a duck tamale.  Best. Tamale. Ever. The masa is a light, fluffy cloud with so much incredible flavor. It melts in your mouth.

(update: okay emotions were high... the food was not horrendous it was very unexpectedly different.)  Without ranting, the place was very modern and hip, cool atmosphere and great location. Aside from that the rest was beyond subpar.  Out of date beer, over a month past the best by date. Food was cold in the middle and just not what was expected. That would have been fine if the server had checked on us at least once to console our feelings of discontent, but he did not.  One of our dining guests ordered a salad that came undressed, and requesting dressing went unheard. She did finally get her dressing after the rest of the table had finished their meals.  However, the restaurant was not busy at all. We counted one large party and six other tables throughout the establishment.   The service made the entire experience.  And it was not a good one at all.  Management promptly contacted me to correct the situation. I appreciate it and will try again.",

For cocktails, I got the Alebrije, which went down pretty easy, but I definitely felt it later that night. GF got the Abismo Negro that tasted like a manhattan and had a much stronger hit while drinking it.   Food-wise I got the short ribs which were were so tender I could have eaten it with a spoon and tasted great. The polenta and veggies it came with felt like it could have been incorporated better with the meat. GF got the fried fish which was cooked well, but needed a little something (sauce?) to give it a bit more flavor. Overall we were pretty happy and would love to hit this place up next time we are in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Well this was a fun restaurant to visit. The wait staff was all friendly and happy to be there. There was a concert so the wait was 40 min but I think we were sat around 30ish minutes so no complaints. Everyone was just in a great mood and singing to some of the great songs that they were playing as they were walking by. We had four in our party, ordered the white sangria, red sangria, sprite (comes in a very tall glass bottle), chimi, trio dip, plain cheese quesadilla, green chicken Chile and the veggie skewers. The white sangria was the better of the two with pineapple as the fruit while the other had apples. Ive had better sangria for a better price ($11 a glass) is steep for the small wine glass you get that's mostly filled with fruit. The chimi was delicious and comes with guac. The portion size and presentation were great. The veggie skewers were sadly just green and yellow squash, not other veggies. They come with the cotija cheese on it and  a unique sauce on the side (which isn't mentioned in the description). Quesadilla was also good (hard to mess up), the green chili was a great portion, it wasn't spicy to me but was flavorful. Some of the chicken appeared to be a little over cooked as it was very chewy but overall it is something I would order again. The chip trio was bean ceviche, guac and salsa. They only gave us one spoon so we had to pour it onto our plates so it became messy. The guac and salsa were good, the bean ceviche is different. Not a huge fan of black eyed peas and they seemed to take up a lot of the mixture. The bill was $85 and while nothing stuck out to us that we would have to each again, the menu has many options so we will def be back to try more things. I like that they did offer ice water when waiting for our table ( it's over 100 degrees out and everyone was sweating to death), but I wish they would've refilled our chips. With four adults and one small bowl having a refill would be nice (Chips and salsa is $3 but the trio is $12). The decor is beautiful from the giant door you walk into, to the booths to the light fixtures, just WOW.",

(I also don't see my 5-star review of Welcome Diner anymore, so maybe they took that down too. Ha.) Anyway that might explain why there aren't more glowing reviews if legitimate 5 star reviews are getting pulled. Evidently opinion is divided on Chico Malo. I can only speak for myself and the four friends I went with. We ordered a ton of dishes and thought literally everything we tried was bomb. The pork verde was one of my new favorite meals, period. We also met the owners and they were super friendly, which is why I'm bothering with a review when I don't usually do that.  As a Glendale native I feel like I know my Mexican food pretty well. I grew up on Pedro's, Rosita's, and Carolina's. This stuff is a little different. Fancier, more up-market, more experimental and creative. I'd put it in a category with Gallo Blanco or Richardsons / Rokerij. Great for a date or a night out.  If it'll make Yelp happy I'll give a criticism: the menu isn't super baby-friendly, according to my friends who brought their toddler, since it's rather spicy. So if you've got a baby in tow, maybe keep that in mind. But if like me you are happy to have a higher-end option for Mexican fare and drinks downtown, I think you'll dig this place.",

    "text": "I met up with some friends here before a concert one night at Talking Stick arena.  When I walked in the place had great ambiance and was bustling with activity.  very cool vibe all around.  Normally i'm always a little skeptical of fancy Mexican food, since I like my Mexican food to come with rice and beans slopped on a plate next to something that looks like it's been deep fried 4 times before doused in gallons of red and or green sauce. However, with that being said, this place delivers on the fancy as well as being just absolutely freaking delicious.  I ordered the new mexico enchilada with a side of coconut lime rice.  Holy cow were both of these things slap yo mama good!  The enchilada was stuffed full of cheese, onions, different veggies and for 9 bucks a hell of a deal.  The rice was also seasoned perfectly and had the perfect light and fluffy consistency you want from a good rice.    I would absolutely go back here to enjoy their other menu items when not pressed for time to be at a concert.  highly recommend",

    "text": "Chico Malo was one of the places that I was a huge skeptic of but I must admit, I came out relatively surprised at how much I liked it. Located downtown in the midst of everything 'busy', (i.e sports events; concerts; etc.). I had passed Chico Malo always thinking , \"Meh. It's gonna be one of 'THOSE places', that has pricing based on the hype of an event and not much to warrant on it's food'. Well. I ate my words the other evening when my husband had made reservations at Chico Malo prior to the Justin Timberlake concert. We arrived about 5 minutes late due to our Uber being stuck in the boggle of both rush hour weekday traffic and the madness of concert goers ready to flood the pre-gaming events downtown, but the hostess was friendly and thankfully, held our reservation. We had a great booth/high table that faced the bar and out towards the street for good people watching. Our waiter had water to us in no time; drinks a few moments later. They have a unique drink menu with some great looking margaritas and some great beers, if that is how you go. My husband is a beer guy; I am a wine girl.. and that sort of 'lacks' with no wine list here. I stuck with a $8 cava despite wanting to really try one of those fresh looking margs, I knew that the night was young and tequila may not be the best idea! Maybe on a later date! I asked about Happy Hour and our waiter said it was over, (our res was for 1700 and mind you it was 1715 when I asked; It says that the happy hour goes until 1800, so I am not sure if this was due to the concert? BUT, this is the part of downtown restaurants that truly frustrates me. Keep it on the real and don't gouge.) I did like that our waiter was friendly and said we should come back and taste some of the tequilas when we spoke about some of our favorites from Mexico that we like to bring back but how we didn't feel like that was the vibe , ( or wise!), for tonight! He also recommended the Trio to start and how to change it up due to an ingredient in the Hummus , (part of the orginal 'trio' selection) that I am allergic to. Loved the salsas and the guac. The chips were tasty and nice and crisp. I had to order the Pan Seared Snapper, which comes whole. It's rare to see that here in AZ, but I do love having it in Mexico! The presentation was amazing! I highly recommend this dish if you are any sort of a seafood lover! Our waiter warned it was a little salty for some, but I found it to be perfect and the right blend of flavors and spice. He told us of the chef changing it up and his history as a once sushi chef and how he loves making the dish and 'playing with its flavors'. Love that in a chef! My husband had the Relleno, which was a fat Poblano filled with cheeses, squash, veggies, crema and the right amount of spices for a perfect taste to the palate. I can honestly say the dishes truly impressed us. On this night there was a DJ popping out JT tunes and it was loud for a Tuesday early evening, but considering, it made for a fun vibe. I didn't really care for the fact that some guy, not our waiter, came to collect our plates and asked if we were ready for the check, (no we wanted one more drink, but thanks.), when we had literally been here just about an hour. All in all its a great place, with a great hip vibe in a great area for the downtown. NOW, if we return and these things happen again, I may not be so ready to repeat, but I do love that I wasn't expecting great and we had it , that is, FOR the most part;  especially for a venue downtown. But as it is said.. there is always room for improvement , just a tad, in this case, on the service scale. :-)  PS, I do recommend reserving in advance when there are events downtown!",

We all started with drinks and a few apps. I had the white pineapple sangria and others had their mango chile drinks and mezcal cocktails. For the table we ordered the elote and requested the corn be cut off the cob, the trio platter of guac, salsa and a bean salsa. All the items were tasty, I esp loved the salsa...it was mild but flavorful. I love corn so the elote was also my favorite.  For our main dish, I ordered the chimichanga and a friend of mine ordered the relleno. Both dishes were so tasty! The chimi was so crispy and the sauces all combined perfectly.  Def added to our places to head back. We all enjoyed the drinks and eats",

The portions aren't huge or as delicious as a hole in the wall place but the location is great downtown as it's by a lot of great bars like Copper Blues. I'm relatively picky about margaritas and got a few skinny's here which I wouldn't say are the best ever but pretty good I think- if you squeeze an extra lime in. The chips are fine but I wish they took half the mountain of salt they put on their margaritas and put it on their chips as they were pretty bland. I do love that they'll serve green or red salsa - I love the green and they give you plenty of guacamole which I appreciate in a restaurant!",

    "text": "Introduction: So I was introduced here from a girl at the front desk of the Hotel I stayed at. So yes, this would make this my first time experience. I need to go back to thank this girl for her recommendation.  Here's Porque!  Customer service: 5/5 Honestly, I've had some amazing service, but I must say, EXCEPTIONAL service can not get better than this.  Our server Brendon was beyond OUTSTANDING, I can't find a word to describe the experience.    He was accommodating, patience and most importantly, super cool.  I messed up and ordered two sodas so Brendon picked one up for me, he totally didn't have to do that, but he did.  Even one of the head manager Peter came by to introduce himself.  All I can say is WOW!  Quality: 5/5 This is probably the tastiest Rib Eye steak I've ever had.  It was tender, juicy and omg! full of taste (highest quality taste).  The corn, dessert and salad was all equally outstanding.    Quantity: 5/5 Super generous and humungous portions.  But guess what? I ate them all cause everything was so good.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Absolutely cozy, perfect temperature and perfect music in volume. You can actually hear each other and enjoy the music at the same time.  Price: 5/5 My usual rule, quality food plus outstanding service equals PRICELESS!   Tips: If you enjoy spicy like myself, you can get Habanero sauce on the side. It makes a perfect combination with the salsa. By the way, Brendon brought it to me voluntarily without me having to ask. What a way to finish my night after a long day.   This is a MUST STOP place next time I am here in Phoenix. Thank you for the great experience Brandon and Peter.",

My father came to visit and was staying at the Renaissance not too far from this place so we walked over to see what they were about.  Back to the decor, it feels like a very modern Mexican restaurant and the layout is layered, as you get further from the bar the nicer it gets. I'm assuming on a busy night this place is poppin.  My Dad and I decided to get the trio for an appetizer, which had guacamole, salsa and a three bean ceviche. All three were pretty good.   For an entree my Dad got a breakfast thing, he really liked it. I had the pozole which is good but I compare every pozole in Phoenix to The Vig and The Vig still has the best pozole in my opinion.

The service was great both times - the staff provided on-point recommendations for beverages, appetizers and entrees.  The Chimichanga was a popular order - and is served extra crispy!  I had the charred cauliflower one night, and carne asada the second evening - both of these entrees were part of their \"make your own taco\" (my words) portion of the menu and are served with fresh tortillas.",

Our sever was a ball of energy which really helped left up the mood for sure. We wanted cocktails and may a little snack. As we ordered our server Mario shared his thoughts on our selections which made our choices even better. My house margarita was good but lacked a little in the lime department, the other was a Mango y Chile. The Mango y Chile was perfect not to sweet. The cocktails had one thing in common you could taste the ingredients as advertised. Nice! We just ordered the Guacamole and chips. Chips were not that great but the Guac was amazing. Cleaned the bowl. Great spot for a larger group and when the weather is perfect the patio is a cool option. Mario made our visit! Ask for Mario but be ready for energy!",

The hostess told us that we should basically leave because the bar was filling up. I couldn't believe my ears. What kind of establishment wants to deny a quick cashout at the bar? I made a comment to my group that they didn't want us there and the hostess rolled her eyes at us. How do people like this get jobs? I have never been denied service to a bar. It really blows my mind. Their loss though, we went to copper blues instead and had a great time. Management should really reevaluate their hostess customer service skills.

The staff was very helpful with the menu (it's not your run of the mill Mexican food items) and the drinks were great.    The food was an adventure.  As I stated before, it's not run of the mill Mexican food, and the chef and cook staff did an amazing job blending flavors and ingredients that I've never seen and/or heard of.  You get what you pay for and it's worth it.  The decor is gorgeous, with just the right mixture of high end and edgy to it.   I've already chosen the restaurant to be a good location for business lunch and social hour, with the agreement of my coworkers that this is a great place to bring other co-workers and consultants.",

First, it took a while to take in the whole menu - so many varieties of food, each with every single ingredient listed.  I ordered the diablo shrimp tacos, which were tasty, plump shrimp in light soft tortilla tacos, a little bit of spice and crunchy shreds of cabbage and some smooth avocado.  There was also some huge plate of chips mixed with all kinds of goodies that kept getting passed around - I didn't order it, but I ate more than my share.  This appears to be a fancy place from the looks of it, and the food is really good, but don't be fooled if someone calls it just \"a Mexican restaurant.\"  It's much more than that.",

We went in with a party of 11 yeah big group but they normally take care of big groups better...not here. We first got there we where the last to arrive and our waiter came and took our drink order came back with everyone else's drinks except ours ok that's fine they were here before us and ordered first. But like 10 minutes later we get our drinks. But then we ordered food got another round of drinks came quicker ok all is well. Nope! We get our food everyone except one so we all waited about 5-10 minutes until he told us to eat so our food isn't cold then waiter came over and was like it'll be out soon then another waitress came over asked what he ordered and said it'll be out soon. What! Then 20 minutes later his food came we are all done eating he ate a bit then asked to be boxed up he was ready to leave.  The manager came over apologized and said that they never told them about the convention that we are in town for so he's not staffed properly. But there where empty tables in there it wasn't packed so I dunno. Food was to fancy for a good Mexican experience, Mexican is not fancy its just good and messy!",

Thomas' tone was condescending as if I was incapable of basic comprehension. The manager we spoke with did the opposite of everything a manager should do. Instead of stepping in and finding an immediate way to resolve the concerns, the manager took the same tone and only after debating the issue for several minutes and  wasting everyone's time, did he decide to do the right thing and resolve the issue- AND this back and forth with the manager happened twice. The way Thomas and the manager decided to interact with me cemented my decision to file a complaint and tell everyone I know not to patronize this establishment. It's abundantly clear that customer service & unconscious bias trainings have never been completed at Chico Malo. There are a number of restaurants in the area, please save yourself and choose another restaurant and bar, especially if you favor a strong drink and a great customer experience!",

We also had carne asada and achiote half chicken. Just incredible.  You won't be disappointed! Park in the building as they validate.",

We finally got seated and I ordered some chips and salsa and the Puerco Verde. I don't usually eat pork but they claim that it was an award winner. Sadly I believed it. Pork is usually flavorful and that's what I was expecting but that wasn't the case. The pork was pretty bland but it did fall of the bone. It wasn't worth the 26 bucks.   However, the customer service was great. Both the host and server were friendly and offered recommendations.",

However, we were both underwhelmed with the flavor of the food. Everything seemed overhyped. The presentation was wonderful. But i feel like it had taken away from the actual essence of the flavor.  We had Chile verde: the sauce tasted fresh but a bit on the acidic side for me.   I got the chille relleno; it wasn't bad but it's not the best I've had.   My husband got the pork verde. The meat was cooked beautifully but, it was very shy of flavor. When you say Mexican food I'm thinking of explosion of flavor in my mouth.   My favorite was the drink. I had the coconut something. Forgot the actual name but it was the highlight of my dinner!",

We'd reserved for 8 and they sat us outside on the terrace area... it was such a perfect day outside. Couldn't have been better. Our server was awesome, brought me a FREE Mother's Day shot of reposado- which was glorious... Thank you!! And then of course was the food!  My daughter ordered the French Toast... the description is mouth watering... apparently this runs out so before you set your sights on it, make sure to ask if they still have some. Apparently we grabbed the last one which we were so glad about!! They were ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!   I enjoyed the Benedict. It was quite tasty.   My brother enjoyed the pork green Chile and it was SO GOOD as well.  And my boyfriend probably had the most savory... he ordered the steak with eggs. That steak flavor..... OH MYYYYYY. Although it's a very small amount of steak they give you, it is so tender and bursting with flavor - like it's been marinated for hours upon hours. It was so damn good.   The margarita is strong but doesn't seem to be - I had two and was certainly feeling them!   Overall an excellent experience. We loved it. Food and service. Thank you, Chico Malo!",

There's an outdoor patio area, the bar top is spacious, and there's a party room in the back.     The bartender was attentive. She checked in multiple times with me while I was there so the customer service was pretty good. It didn't take too long for me to order or for me to receive my food.  I ordered the Diablo Shrimp, which was I was skeptical about at first because I never had noples before and was unsure what it would taste like. But the bartender assured me that the dish is pretty popular so I went with it. It came out as a destruction dish with the tortilla on the side. The dish was composed of shrimps, heirloom potatoes, noples, charred avocado, and aguachile. Overall the entree was pretty good, plenty of flavors and well balanced.    I also ordered a drink, the Oaxacan. It was a standard old fashioned with mezcal. It was smokey but nothing really special.   Chico Malo is a great spot to come and grab a bite if you're in the area near Talking Stick Arena. It's close to the light rail and also close to other great establishments in the Cityscape area.",

This place is located not too far from the Chase stadium and I had noticed it from my adventures at Gypsy Bar right next door.  The weather was amazing that day so we happily sat outside in the patio. We kept it relatively simple as we had eaten a big meal at the game. We ordered some chips and guacamole. The guacamole was moderately chunky and the flavor was was spot on. I was a little disappointed that the chips weren't homemade but they were crispy and the salt balance ratio was to my liking.   I ordered a spicy mango martini which was a total gamble for me as I am not a lover of things spicy. Don't judge me I'm a bit of a punk when it comes to spices. The martini had a little jalapeno kick at the end but it wasn't overwhelming. As backup my boyfriend ordered a grapefruit and ginger cocktail just in case I didn't like my drink and made him switch lol. Lucky for him I loved my martini and he was satisfied with his cocktail.  They were a bit short handed that day but our server was working his butt off and way still very attentive to our needs and even made some time for short talk.  All and all I will go back and recommend this place to others!",

    "text": "Recently I found myself downtown for a retreat and was able to hang out at four City Scape venues. Our first dinner was at Chico Malo. Great vibe and atmosphere. There were eight of us in the party and there was no wait and they were able to accommodate us quickly. The big take away from the entire dinner was our waiter who I believe was named Caleb (at least that's what we will be calling him for this review).   Caleb took our drink orders and gave us a thorough education on the tequilas we were ordering so we could make educated decisions before paying for alcohol. I think most of the party would have said they knew what they liked and didn't need the documentary, but Caleb did a great job encouraging us to try things and step out of what we knew without being a car salesman.   Chips were served with a selection of dipping options. We had your traditional salsa but they also served a type of hummus made from ground white corn with a pesto like drizzle that was great.   Where the disappointment came in was in the meal itself. We ordered short ribs, ceviche, pozado, and a dish called Chile Colorado. This is what I ordered personally and it was \"fine\" but that's about how all of us responded to our entree's. Mostly we were disappointed by the cost to food satisfaction. It wasn't that it tasted bad, but it just didn't blow us away for $16!   Going back to 'Caleb' he observed that one of our party wasn't eating much and was slowly picking at her meal. He volunteered to bring out something else to her satisfaction but she was worried about holding back the rest of us. When Caleb brought the bill, he had taken it off entirely, and apologized that they had not met her expectations and hoped she would come back and try something else.   At the end of the day; it was on THAT comment alone that I give Chio Malo 4 stars rather than 3. They do deserve another visit since there were other menu items I would be willing to try. When I DO return if given the chance, I'll ask for Caleb, or whatever his name is!",

Go get some apple pie moonshine before it's not seasonal anymore!   The facility is hip and the outdoor bar has a great vibe to it. It has a cool bar-like feel without being too loud, so nice for a small group to hang out and relax.   Food wise, the guacamole is a great shareable to put some food in your stomach.

When we first walked in we asked for a seat at the bar & we were seated pretty quickly (it was a Tuesday around 8pm). The bar has an extensive tequila menu with some other spirits for the lesser refined tastebuds (lol!).   The menu has a nice variety and I almost couldn't decide what to get but I'm SOOOO happy I got the chimichanga. I'd fly her from SF for this, I swear.   Food came out quick and was a good temp, not sizzling but warm enough for me to dive right in.  Our server, who I assume works bar too, was a little snarky at the beginning and I didn't like that. BUT after asking him for a bunch of stuff, including their HOMEMADE, yes made in house fresh crema, he warmed up to us.   He gave us a bunch of history on the restaurant/building and was super appreciative when we praised the food so I'd be happy to sit in his section again.   Overall... food and service was great and I'll be dreaming of that chimichanga tonight.",

Our waiter (Mario) and the manager (Peter)  were AMAZING!  We had a small problem with the corn and it was taken care of immediately although we did not want to complain since we were really here more for the views and to just enjoy the night.   Now let's talk about the food. The elote was delicious although it did lack a little Chile de polvo to make it feel authentic. The el pastor tacos we amazing. The meat was tender and it was flavorful. The dessert.... oh my the dessert!!! The churros were so soft... so so soft and probably the best thing I had here.   The beer was cold and the wine was at the right temperature.   I would recommend this place and we will be back.",

We got the happy hour corn dish called \"Elote.\"   Quite possibly the best thing I have ever had while being on Yelp.  We got one for appetizer and said screw it and got another one for dessert.  Get it.   Tacos were good.  The best ones were surely the fried avocado and pork green chili.  The others were average but these tacos and the Elote make it worth the stop.",

Cocktails were equally lovely and overall we are new fans and can't wait to come back and try more on the menu. Portions were great, the salsa flight was sooo good. I ordered the green chili chicken, others got the short ribs, shrimps tacos, chimis and a salad that looked incredible. I would highly recommend coming here for any occasion!

We were very excited but it was too rare and half the steak was pure fat and gristle. NOT HAPPY. We were too starved to send it back to cook a bit  more. Not worth the $80.00. The service was very slow. We loved the restaurant itself. It's beautiful and very artistic with the beautiful Mexican inspired murals. My daughter and I really enjoyed it.",

I also ordered their chips with salsa roja and a Mexico City Quesadilla (neither on the HH menu as I chose to steer away from it for my food because I had my heart set on a quesadilla). Both were perfectly sized for happy hour time and the quesadilla was delicious. The chips and salsa were average - I don't know many places that can make these stand out, so that's not a negative to me.

We ordered the Traditional guacamole tasted like it was sweetened which I wasn't a huge fan of but it was still good. The queso cheese dip was good but wasn't the drippy- cheese you'd be used to. It was like a thick melted block of cheese in a mini iron skillet which was kind of hard to \"dip\" and because you kind of had to grab it in between the tortilla. Nonetheless it was still yummy! I got the 3 for $10 tacos with the Crispy Avocado taco, the Diablo Shrimp taco, and the Machaca taco (pictured left to right). Crispy Avocado taco had a really nice fried, crispy outside that was really satisfying and the shrimp Diablo Shrimp taco had a bit of good spice to it, but my favorite was definitely the Machaca taco. The shredded beef in it was seasoned to perfection and with the corn tortillas, it was unmatched. The size of the tacos are more like street tacos but were very filling if you get the 3 for $10. It was a little slow because they were understaffed but the politeness and food made up for the speed of service. Interior was trendy and would be good for parties up to maybe 6 at a normal booth. Loved it!",

But I did, and it was a good decision.  Ordered the tradito tuna and a flight of tacos (we do that in California), which consisted of duck carnitas, polla tinga, and crispy avocado. They are street taco size (fit in your hand), but they loaded a sizeable portion of filling in each one. Also sipped on a glass of house red , which was described as a cab blend coming off close to a pinot. And we all know how I get around pinots...  The crispy avocado was a fried/tempura avocado slice on a bed of red cabbage. It was different, but nothing to write home about.  The pollo tinga was tasty; loaded such that it broke my tortilla.  The DUCK CARNITAS is what you want. Man, so good, I thought I ordered the short rib by mistake! I could've eaten another one, but body said, \"No, that's enough calories for today.\"  Three tacos will hit the spot for you, unless you come in uber hungry. I'll be back tomorrow to try their Bad Boy Brew (cold brew & horchata)!",

The food, staff, and drinks are all really good! The happy hour is pretty solid with $5 margaritas (which are great) and some discounted small plates.   The first time we went, we were served by Angel (I LOVE YOU), and he was great! He gave us suggestions and our drinks were always full. The chips and salsa (verde and montezuma) are a must when starting. The montezuma salsa is a bit different, but it's excellent. I believe I have tried every taco on their menu and was not disappointed with any of them. My favorites have to be pollo tinga, chorizo and papas, and the short rib.   I see that people are mostly complaining about the prices on the tacos. Yes, they are priced higher than tacos that you get on the street for 50 cents, however, the ingredients that Chico Malo is using are fresh and also from local businesses. The tortillas are made in house and are perfect. You are paying more for the quality of these tacos, which is totally worth it.   Chico Malo is a great restaurant! The decor and wait staff is super nice. I'm excited to see the restaurant progress.",

    "text": "Everything at Chico Malo is amazing! From the fresh made chips and salsa all the way to the dessert! This is a modern take on Mexican food that you will not find at any other place here in Phoenix. They have a house made grapefruit soda that they put in their Loma Bonita and it is to die for. (I had 3 ;))  Apps: The Nichie Nachos - Creamy and cheesy, TO DIE FOR! The Pork Belly Tostada had an egg cream that complimented the black bean puree.   You must get the Puerco beans to compliment your tacos.   I've been to Chico Malo a few times so I've tried almost all the tacos they offer. My favorite is the pork belly! Its spicy and sweet.   If you are going for dinner I would suggest the Layered Pollo Fundido that comes with a braised chicken leg on the side or the Chile Ribeye that melts in your mouth.   Finally, are the desserts!!! I ordered the Pineapple Chili Panna Cotta and my husband ordered the Tres Leches Rice pudding. Both were outstanding. I cannot wait to go back and try some of their salads at lunch. Till next time!",

    "text": "Made a reservation for opening night, as it's been a highly anticipated restaurant to open in the downtown Phoenix scene. The decor and environment compliments the artistic scene of downtown Phoenix, yet they stand apart from other Mexican restaurants in the valley.  I went with a large group of friends, so we can all taste the different variety of options. Drink selection was okay. I was expecting more.   To start, we ordered the guacamole, and it did not really have any flavor. We even added chicharones and bananas, but there was something missing that we couldn't pin-point. It just tasted like an avocado-banana smoothie. The guac came with three salsas (that needed salt) and the hottest salsa was not spicy.   I ordered the Baja Fish tacos, which I do recommend. Also, I ordered the shrimp ceviche which lacked flavor of traditional shrimp ceviche. The avocado underneath took away from the other unique fruits and veggies that were added.  I want to say there was more avocado then ceviche.) We also ordered Chicken Tinga, Pastor, Carne Asada, and Duck tacos. The most popular ones among the group were the Duck and Carne asada tacos.   Overall, the customer service experience was phenomenal, but the food did not cut it. It was honestly disappointing, because I was expecting more. I know this was the grand opening, so I will give Chico Malo a second chance :)",

Yes it's a little pricey, but this is something you should check out before you go to a place. Sometimes unique recipes and quality ingredients result in higher prices. I had a duck carnitas with candied pecans and pickled red onions. It was not tiny, contrary to what most people are saying, very tasty, and where else can you get duck carnitas??  Also, had two mezcal drinks with charcoal that were strong--pretty much all booze--for $10 each. Pretty standard for a cocktail that is all liquor. Also, the montezuma salsa some of the best salsa I've had in my life, if not the best. Also, the server was dope. I will concede that the guac is objectively overpriced (but still delicious) and was not completely stoked on the chorizo taco. People are haters.",

With regards to the food, it was good although it's not exactly traditionally prepared. The value was ok... it's location sorta implies that it'll be spendy, and I would say that that was True.

    "text": "Amazing brand new urban Mexican food restaurant  in the heart of downtown Phoenix at CityScape. There's not many Mexican food places in the area, so Chico Malo has the market and any other that tries to challenge will have hard time beating them. This new restaurant is amazing. The atmosphere and ambience is incredible and mind blowing with art installations and large murals that graffiti the walls. It has a bar, lounge dining room, and patio seating. Everything is made in house and rom scratch including their chips, tortillas, roja, verde, and signature Montezuma salsa that I would describe as if salsa and hummus had a baby. The food is delicious and a flavorful explosion. They put a great twist on some timeless Mexican traditional dishes and serve a variety of street tacos from duck carnitas to pork belly and chicken tinga that all complements well with their cocktail list that puts a spin on tequila and margaritas. They even have a tableside guacamole cart that is made fresh right in front of you. The staff and waiters are very friendly and upbeat and knowledge about the menu and what flavors to expect from the food as well as the cocktails. They are open for quick grab and go breakfast items as well as stout a quick lunch service to grab some tacos on your lunch hour and a sit down dining experience for dinner time. A burrito cart is slated to be up and running shortly too that will most likely cater to the after hours night life scene of downtown. This new restaurant is a must if you are downtown. Whether you are out to lunch or heading to a game, concert, or comedy show.",

Chico Malo blew us away! Really urban and unique interior experience. Great music...and the service was the best we have experienced. We were really Impressed with the different flavor combinations. Super tasty tacos and definitely try the rice. Our night got a thousand times better when we ordered the pineapple dessert. Most unique and best dish I've tried. Margaritas were perfect...we honestly enjoyed every bit. Super excited to have such a unique restaurant we can venture to on the regular.",

The servers gave us (there was about 12 of us) attitude in the form of rolled eyes and telling me to \"hold on\" while they're giving part of my order to someone else. And I guess I should be more specific when asking for water. The water out of my facet is colder than what they gave us. I'm not going to go into everything. It was overall an unpleasant experience. The staff is made up of inexperienced, seemingly privileged little snots that could use some training and some work ethic.   To end on a positive note:  Although they took forever, the drinks and tacos were delicious.",

The food was so good, that flavor profiles were complex and interesting, and everyone at the table was amazed by how many unique flavors there were. The avocado tacos were a lot of fresh avocado and the pickled vegetable (beets??) were such a great compliment to the dish. The menu is short but great, but I was disappointed all of the mixed drinks were made with mezcal which is a Smokey tequila that I really can't stand. But they were very accommodating and got me a beer, then they even didn't charge us for dessert because it took a while to come out. Really impressive place!",

    "text": "Food: 3.0 Service: 3.5 Ambiance: 4.0 Wait: 1.5 hrs  I dropped by Chico Malo on a Saturday night around 7:00 pm without a reservation (oh what a mistake on my part). I was told that it'd be a 30 min - 1 hr wait for a table for 2 and figured that I'd try and stick it out. Frankly, I expected to be called in about 40 minutes, but lo and behold that was not the case. My friend and I were seated roughly 1.5 hrs after we had initially put our names down. That being said, it was most likely our faults that we had such a long wait since we showed up at a popular place during peak hours on a Saturday.   Once we were seated our server brought over some water, took our drink orders, and then effectively disappeared for a while. He did eventually resurface to grab our food orders but after that 1.5 hr wait, we were both feeling somewhat impatient. Now it took quite some time for the food to come out though other parties around us who ordered food after us seemed to have at least something on the table. Now I understand that certain foods take a while to be prepped and made and all that, but I expected the chips and guacamole/salsa/mixed bean ceviche to be out quite quickly. The chips, however, took about 20 minutes to be brought out and our food came out immediately after.   We ordered the trio, the avocado tacos, the al pastor tacos, and the elote. The star of the night for me was the roja salsa in the trio whereas my friend said that the elote was his favorite. Now it's great that we found things we liked, but it was disappointing that they were basically appetizers rather than entrees. In terms of the entrees, my friend enjoyed the al pastor tacos, but felt that they were under seasoned. My avocado tacos were good, but a bit inconsistent. Two of the tacos on my plate were quite salty whereas the other one was super bland. Also, the crema used on the avocado tacos had a coconut undertone that I just did not appreciate very much. I ended up adding roja salsa to them in order to make them more palatable tbh.  I have a feeling that I will not return to this restaurant after my experience tonight, particularly if I don't have a reservation. The inside was beautiful but the noise level was super high, the service was very scattered, and the food just wasn't that great. I just feel that PHX has so many other places that do Mexican cuisine much better.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to this restaurant for dinner.  We were not impressed with the service, we were less impressed with the food.    This place is downtown and parking will be a little difficult so plan on that aspect.  I don't care about parking and would never gauge a restaurant on how good the parking is, but just to let you know if you go.  We go to a lot of Mexican food restaurants here in Phoenix and anywhere we travel.  We enjoy great Mexican food.    When we walked in, at about 7:30PM on a Saturday night, the hostess looked at us like we made her mad.  She got up from her seat, grabbed two menus and said \"this way\".  I tried to make small talk but she would not even acknowledge me.  We sat at a nice table by the window and she was gone.  No personality at all and no enjoyment in what she was doing. Our waitress was nice and very attentive.  We were in a slight rush but she did not mind and we enjoyed her attitude.  She was the only bright star of the night.  We even asked her if the hostess was having a bad day and to let the manager know that she gives a very bad first impression.  We saw her walk over to what I assume was the manager and tell him something.  He just shook his head and she walked away.  This place talks a good deal about their bold approach to Mexican food and their name implies that this will be memorable.  From a food perspective, it was less than mediocre.  First, their salsa was bland and tasted like something you get from the grocery store.  The chips were stale and flavorless.  There was only one type of salsa and it had zero spicy-ness.  We ordered guacamole and it was OK.  Not the best, but ok.  We ordered street tacos to split, with three different fillings to get a flavor for what they had to offer.  They too were bland.  The plate came with Chorizo as an accompaniment.  It tasted ok but was less than room temperature.  We asked the waitress if it was supposed to be cold and she said \"no\".  She offered us a replacement but there was no need.  The other item on the plate was a crema guacamole paste that was inedible.    Overall I just do not think this place has good food.  Nothing tasted great, nothing stood out, and most was either bland, made poorly, or was not good.  We have so much to offer in Phoenix when it comes to great Mexican fare.  I would hate for a visitor to get the impression that this is anything close to our potential.",

    "text": "Great location, nice decor and nice presentation of the food but I feel like more time/effort could went into the flavor. Also a bit expensive.  We had the chorizo and potato tacos (3), tacos al pastor (3), shrimp ceviche, side of rice, chips and guacamole and two drinks. We spent $85 with tip.  The rice lacked flavor, the sauce of some kind in the chorizo tacos was a bit odd. The ceviche was presented as almost a sushi type roll no liquids what so ever. I definitely wouldn't call any of the food \"Mexican\", it's more Mexican inspired dishes.  In my opinion, I think they are trying to do a little to much with the food. Sadly we will not be returning.  Tacos from a street corner truck are far better than what we had here.",

Just the right amount of acidity. The chicken had a wonderful warm smokey layer to it that hit the spot. Really friendly servers as well. Would absolutely come back here!",

After we said no, he welcomed us by walking us through the menu, highlighting some of his favorite things, and asking if we wanted something to drink. He is knowledgeable about the food items and drinks.   We shared a chip and salsa to start and then split the chicken tinga ahogada torta The two things together were enough to kill the hunger. The drinks were also good. The loma bonita is pretty strong with the housemade tequila. The paraiso tropical is refreshing because it's a cava-base. We also briefly tried the alebrije, but it was too smokey for us (which the waiter did describe). The chicken torta was definitely the star of the meal. It was flavorful, and the \"smoked english pea guac\" just worked. Strange, but it was really good.   I haven't been to many places around cityscape, but I wouldn't mind coming back!",

I had the chicken chimichanga which had an amazing flavor! Not spicy, just full of flavor! The guacamole, red and green salsa and chorizo where outside the chimichanga on the same plate so you could try each separately. This was great as each bite was a little different depending on what ingredient you had! Even without any of those add ones it was still delicious! I also had the alebrije drink. Overall a good drink but wouldn't call it amazing. The waiter was nice and food came out quite fast. The chimichanga looked smaller than I'm used to but was very filling! It is a nicer restaurant on the more expensive side so something to keep in mind.. but such good flavor still a 5 star!",

We ordered the scallop and whitefish ceviche, queso fundido, and shrimp tacos.  The scallop and whitefish ceviche tasted very fresh and the best ceviche I had this year in the Greater Phoenix area.  5-stars.  We both loved it.  The queso fundido was actually made out of real cheese.  You can taste the difference.  Plus you can see the melted cheese as you dip the chips in.  Chips were very fresh as well.  Beats fundido at most places that use cheese substitute and it looks clumpy.  Definitely, they have a chef working here. 5-stars.  The shrimp tacos were interesting and tasty.  4.5 stars.  Really nice fun vibe on a Friday night and fun music.  We love this place and plan to visit when we are nearby.  Update 11/18/2017:   Carne Asada Entree: NY strip steak fajitas is a solid 4-stars.  Service was very good.",

Our work paid for us so we ordered unlimited margaritas (so clean and fresh tasting) sangria (cinnamon, yes please) and every other cocktail you could think of.  We ordered the salsa... Amazing! Guacamole... Yummy! The queso fundido- came piping hot with little corn tortillas.. Clearly homemade... Omg so good. I got the whole snapper... I can't say enough!!! So good!!!",

    "text": "I've enjoyed my experience at Chico Malo in the two times I've been there. We were there a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and ordered a whole bottle of tequila and had a wonderful time.   We started our night out with traditional guacamole and queso fundido which were both delicious. I had the elote and it was delicious as well. I ordered the tijuana caesar for my main dish and it was definitely not what I expected - they bring you a whole romaine lettuce. It was unique and I enjoyed it. I liked the vibe of Chico Malo and the service was good. The price point was on par with other restaurants in downtown Phoenix. The location was prime. You can pop in for good food and a few drinks and make your way out to the bars close by. I will definitely be back for drinks and tacos.",

    "text": "I my recent trip to Phoenix, I was looking for a good Mexican food place that was within walking distance of my hotel. Chico Malo was literally right across the street. My friend and I walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess. She was friendly enough, but still had this dull demeanor about her. We were seated and given menu's to review. Everything looked amazing! I was watching the plates come out to other patrons and the food looked both appetizing and the presentation was on point. After about 10 minutes of waiting for someone to come over, our waitress finally came by and took our drink orders. One thing I noticed that I just couldn't shake, was that the wait staff is very very slow here. The restaurant was empty, only 12 people in there including us. There was no reason why it would take someone 10+ minutes to come and take a drink order. The bartender was slow, the service came out slow, I'm wondering if me being from L.A. has anything to do with it. Maybe I'm just being too privileged and whiny...I am, please accept my apologies. I guess this is how things go in Arizona....not sure. We ordered a bunch of plates and they did come out about 25 minutes later. I think the latino server with the nose ring was the only one that had a sense of urgency. Nonetheless, the food arrived and it was good. I ordered the Chilaquiles, my friend ordered the chile relleno. For the table, we ordered the potato tacos and the cowboy beans. Although the food was delicious, I think the only food that actually stood out were the potato tacos. They were delicious! Everything else was just wayyyy to salty. We scarfed down the tacos and left the rest. We ordered two margaritas that were the size of a thimble, thank god they were only $10. To end this review, Chico Malo is a good restaurant, the ambiance is nice, however the service is lacking and the food is way too salty. I most likely will not return, unless its for the potato tacos.",

    "text": "Neat vibe, great location for a business lunch. There was music but it was not loud enough to preclude decent conversation. This was my first visit. I ordered the taco trio -- Chicken, pork and beef. The tortillas were nice and the toppings generous, flavorful and artistically presented. Everything was super tasty with nice combinations of flavor from the meats and toppings. So why only three stars? None of the meats were even hot enough to melt the cheese on top. Very flavorful but left me worried about food safety. Still, I enjoyed every morsel.  I also think a small bowl of free chips and a small side of salsa should at least be offered for this kind of a price point for a business lunch. The bill for my co-worker and I was $28 for lunch, plus we had to pay for parking.  Bonus: There are cool murals inside by local artists like JB Snyder and others!",

My original review was somewhat less than gratuitous, however Kate invited myself and my family back and showed us a wonderful time. We ordered a few drinks, tableside guac, tacos, and a dessert. Our food was good, I'd definitely recommend the avocado tacos, they were sweet, light and delicious. The tableside guac was wonderful that is had so many options, we added in all of the ingredients, even the banana! The serving size of guac is on the smaller size for the price tag of $14. Overall, I'll definitely be back. The decor and ambience are just perfect. It is a good addition to downtown and I'm looking forward to seeing it do well. It is nice to see restaurant owners that care about their patrons!",

The tacos were delicious, most of them are gourmet rather than traditional. I had the tacos al pastor, pork belly and Baja fish. The fish wasn't my favorite and I wouldn't order again. The pastor was very traditional and delicious, the pork belly was my favorite! We also ordered the guacamole which the make fresh table side, I loved being able to pick what to put in. Would definitely order again. The prices are a bit high, there are other taco places near by that have lower prices and just as good of food. A few tacos are filling but the prices of entrees there are a bit steep for the area.  The only reason I couldn't give this 4 stars is because the margarita was absolutely horrible, whoever decided to put vanilla into a margarita was way off. My friend and I could stomach more than a few sips.",

The menu however warrants 2 stars at best...  while I appreciate the use of local ingredients and upscale presentation I just can't see downtown locals paying these prices on a regular hangout type of place basis...    if Chico Malo makes it, it will be because of tourists...",

Through out the restaurant I found delightful artwork that followed traditional south of the border lines and shapes as well as new age art defining this place as hip as well as traditional. The food is made with creativity and love allowing your palette too experience an explosion. I love the cocktails the chicorita made with vanilla Simple is just that simple and delicious. The duck confit taco is unheard of and out of this world made with a cherry walnut mole sauce a must have. The chips and salsa rojo or verde are savory and not overbearing in spice made with just enough  kick to pair it with the bomb table side guac where you can choose everything from pomegranate bananas to keeping it basic cilantro and limes can be used the options are endless.",

Their \"happy hour\" consists of a small menu of items that are not priced differently from the regular menu which is also deceiving. Only bright spot is the construction of the restaurant which was definitely not something they held their budget back from. That would explain $5-$6 cost per taco.",

I ordered the pork belly taco and the pollo tinga taco. The flavors of both were very good. However, the servings were similar to street tacos without the double tortilla. For the price, $12, it was not a lot of food.  Taste was good, but way overpriced for what you get.   I sat at the bar. The gentleman next to me had the Caesar salad. He ended up ordering more food due to the small portion size as well.   I also didn't like that the manager walked away with my debit card for over 5 minutes rather than ringing me up right away.   Very disappointed. My 2 stars are for the taste only.",

We were seated and 10-15 minutes later, noone came to wait on us. I mean not even a hello or a drink order. We saw tables seated after us were being served. It was like we didnt exist. It was infuriating. I was not impressed with the prices either. I got the chance to memorize that damn menu for as long as I sat. $5 minimum for a (as in 1) \"taco\"? No thanks. The menu prices were outrageous and the service was god awful. NEVER again!!!!",

We ordered the watermelon cocktail (god I don't remember the damn name), but it was interesting with its smokey tequila, fresh melon, and a hint of chili. We were just going to get dessert ( the pineapple panna cotta was divine), but the huge cart-o-guacamole rolled by, so of course we couldn't turn that down. There were so many interesting options to add to the mighty guac. I wanted to try the chicken skin, and my husband had to be really weird and add banana, much to my protest--but what the hell, you only live once! We added it all in addition to a lot of heat! It was so delicious and interesting, I wanted to throw the rest in my purse with a spoon for the concert, but you know, class... All in all, we really enjoyed this place and look forward to making it our downtown spot. On a side note, the chef was banging and f-bombing passionately in the kitchen. Next Gordon Ramsey? Maybe, but definitely a seat indoors next to the kitchen next time for dinner and a show. Whatever he's doing in there, it's working! Food was great. Thanks!",

I work at a local hotel at the front desk, and I always recommend my guests here. If they are receiving the same experience as I did, I am very embarrassed. My servers name was Andre. After sitting for about 10 minutes without being greeted, he brings us water, and as he was pouring it into our glasses he was engaging with the table next to us. Our food was then brought by someone else and I only saw Andre two times after that and once was for the check. The food was excellent, and I really wished the service would have matched.",

I don't recall the servers name but he was short with dark hair, chubby and wearing lots of make up.  Every interaction with this puke was horrendous and just nasty, from being pissed we weren't ready to order after 30seconds with the menu, to rolling his eyes at us for returning a flat beer (he didn't  know beer should have bubbles, he 'doesn't drink beer, he drinks vodka'! Why the hell he thought that comment was appropriate I have no idea) He was a constant little baby until put in his place at which point he tried to make conversation with us, which was so cringeworthy it made us laugh out loud.  The highlight was watching him have a bar tender stir our flat beer with a straw and try to return it to us as a new one! The look on his face when he saw us watching. Big fat $0 tip for being a little baby.  No manager 'available' unfortunately when we were about to leave.   Apart from the terrible 'salsas' (Christ only knows who tasted them and sent them out) the food was great.",

I left a $5 tip, then when I looked at my account the next day, there was another $10 charge from them taken out of my account. I went in a couple days later and spoke to a manager and asked her to fix it. She didn't know what she was doing so she took my info and said another manager would contact me to resolve it. Never heard from anyone after that. The whole thing seemed pretty shady. Then manager that was talking to the busboy told him he was going to give him a couple extra bucks at the end of the night after telling him that people were talking bad about him, so maybe that's where the $10 went. Definitely will not visit this place again.",
