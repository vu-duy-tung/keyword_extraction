Crackers uses good portions of great ingredients. I had a steak sandwhich, which had tons of steak, delicious onions and peppers, plenty of cheese, and probably half an avacado. I definitely recommend this plate, but more importantly I think it's indicative of how they prepare food. My girlfriend had some variation of a French Dip- same story.  Service was consistent and food was timely. Prices are reasonable, you're going to be out around $10 for a plate of food, drink, and left overs.  Unfortunately no booze here.",

The sandwich was very good and hearty. The side of fries seemed a bit small in portion and little over salted.   Prices are resonable for a sandwich and side (soup, fries, salad), 7.99-8.99. The burger options run about the same price.  The menu offers lots of options-sandwiches, burgers, salads, half soup/sandwich etc.  Breakfast items are served all day, everday which is always a nice thing. I plan on heading back to try the breakfast since many people say this is a good spot for breakfast items.",

It is simple food such as sandwiches and soups, but they make you want to try every item on their menu.  We ended up bringing my dad back the next day to try breakfast because our lunch was so good.  We also went back another day for lunch with the whole family again (6 of us), so not exactly a small party.  We had a different server each time and each one was as good as the last.  One even had another employee run and buy grenadine for a drink my dad ordered.  Even when we modified orders to our liking or added soups and whatnot, they were always willing to accommodate.  It is well worth stopping in and the employees earned their tips with the above and beyond service they provided.  I am looking forward to visiting AZ again and heading to Crackers for breakfast and lunch!",

She had no idea what food went where, drinks were the same. Very few refills. My cup stayed empty of water for more than 10 minutes, I asked for a refill, and it still took another 10 minutes to get one. And then they were out of iced tea...even when they were going to be open for at least another hour and a half. How does that happen???   One girl didn't get her ranch with her meal. She brought it back really quickly, but had already forgotten who asked. She took it to the opposite end of the table.   I had the Wednesday special. Chicken Parmesan sandwich on a grilled Italian roll with fries. Sandwich was ok. I actually perfer the same sandwich at Mimi's. The fries were really good! Glad I got those over the salad. My friend was picking out the slimy lettuce from her salad.   Thankfully this time we went with one check, as opposed to the split ones from last time. I would have hated to see how she handled that.",

On a cold day, that can only mean your coffee sucks.  So I opted for hot cooca to warm me up.  It tasted like Swiss Miss minus the funky marshmallows.  It warmed me up so it did it's job. I ordered the Belgian waffle sandwich, which is not a sandwich.  It's a waffle with 2 eggs and 2 bacon on the side.  I cannot complain about my bacon or scrambled eggs.  They were tasty.  My Belgian waffle came with strawberries, at a small extra charge.  It was good.  It was a little crispier than I prefer.  I like a soft fluffy waffle and it was only that deep in the center.  It would have been amazing if taken out of the griddle about 30 seconds earlier.   My date ordered the Vatican skillet with biscuits and gravy.  It looked like a pile of potatoes covered by two eggs.  He said there was sausage and some other stuff in there, but I didn't see it.  I took a bite of his biscuits and gravy and the gravy tasted gritty.  Like gravy from a mix or with too much flour tastes gritty. The service was prompt and polite.  The decor was nice.  Looks like a model home inside.  It was cozy and unmemorable... just like when I cook at home, but someone else got the tip.",

Great food with wonderful customer service. Tuna melt, a BLT with added roasted turkey on top, and the crepes were all nice and flavorful. Good quantity.  More people should know about this place. Looking forward to stopping in again when back in town  Thanks!!!!",

I got the Breakfast Sandwich, the croissant was buttery and flakey, the bacon was crisp and the egg was nice and fluffy. It came with a side of fresh fruit, it was a nice assortment of fruits. He got the Southwest Carnitas Skillet, which was delicious! The carnitas were so flavorful and tender. We also ordered the Butterfinger French Toast  to share, and those were great. The Butterfinger flavor was not overwhelming, it was the perfect combo. Our server was friendly and patient, as we can in around 2 pm, when the place closes at 2:30. Overall, the experience was great and we will definitely be back!",

My favorite breakfast is the chorizo and carnitas skillet, and my favorite lunch item is the carnitas melt.  Always tender and perfect!  When family and friends come to visit me in Tempe, I bring them here.  It's always a big hit!  Other must-try items: French toast, Nutella crepes and loaded baked potato soup.  I hear the bread pudding is delicious, but I'm always too full for dessert!",

We shared 2 slices of French toast but we should have ordered one because it was huge but best French toast I've ever had so good.

I have been here about a half a dozen times, and I feel like I've never had to wait to be seated. The girls who work the hostess station work diligently to get everybody fed as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed! However, if you are someone who enjoys Sunday cocktails for brunch, this is not the spot for you. They have mimosas, but they are not worth the price and this restaurant doesn't have a hangout and relax \"brunchy\" vibe. Also, the servers are not as on-point as they should be with the place being as busy as it is, but they get you your food in a timely manner and I suppose that's what matters most. Super yummy breakfast though...give it a try for sure!",

I had the huevos rancheros and the beans were soupy and the only thing that had flavor was the corn tortilla. The potatoes they talk about sound good on the menu but are also flavorless and soggy being partially cooked.  Less than half way through my food, I took a bite and CHOMP!, there was a large piece of a ceramic glass dish hidden between the eggs and flavorless beans. I stopped to make sure my teeth were not broken as I crunched the piece into 3 other pieces.   Asked for the manager and he came out. Very emotionless, he says he will comp the dish. You bet you are!  There was no apology, it was an \"I will take it off your check\" and walked away.   On our way out, I walked past him again and he didn't say a thing and I do not think he cared anyways.   Customer service is VERY IMPORTANT.  Without it, you get 1 STAR yelp reviews and breakfast eaters who will not return.",

    "text": "I remember the first time that I tried Crackers Cafe. I had seen it in the shopping center across the street from where I live and was not sure what kind of place it was. I admit I thought it was just another local business that would be gone within the year. But it remained. It took me awhile to realize it was just a breakfast and lunch place. I thought either no one was ever there or they had closed. Then when I finally drove by when they were open I noticed they were packed and from then on I noticed when they were open they seemed to be jumping. Then I heard some people talking about how good it was so I thought time to try this place out. I was blown away. So good. The second and third time I went there still blown away. I took friends there and they were blown away too. I tried a lot of different things on the menu and they were all great. I liked the fact that they had like 5 different Eggs Benny dishes and they were all different. Who doesn't like variety. I didn't even know there were more than a few ways to make Eggs Benny. So I continued to talk it up to everyone. It went down as one of my favorite breakfast places and it was local so that was even better. When I joined Yelp last month I thought I have to go to my favorite breakfast place so I can write a review. I didn't just want to write a review from past experience I wanted to write one based on an experience I had just had. So I had some things to do last Saturday morning and after those tasks were completed I headed over for a mid morning breakfast. Now here comes the giant BUT. If you hadn't seen it coming down the street with all this build up how could you miss it. I so wanted to give this place, my favorite place for breakfast, 5 stars. I had anticipated giving it 5 stars BUT after going there this time I just can't. When I got there they were busy as usual but there were not a lot of people waiting which was a good sign. I asked for a table for 2 and they said it would be about 15 minutes. Now I could see a few empty tables but thought they must have their reasons. While we were waiting I asked to check out a menu. See what I wanted and help pass the time. First thing I noticed was that they upgraded their menus. Nice and new with graphics looked really sharp. Ok cool they put some money back into the place and got some new menus printed up. Good for them. Then I noticed that they had changed the menu. Eek. What was going on. They went from having 5 Eggs Bennies to only 3 now and a few other things were missing. Ok. Deep breath. Other signature things were still there. Maybe they just trimmed out the things that were not selling as well. We were seated after a few minutes. Waiter came over and was very nice as usual. Ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. My mother is very picky about how her eggs are cooked but they came out perfect and I got the French Toast which was amazing as usual. Our waiter checked on us but then disappeared for the rest of the meal. No refills. No other checks. Nothing. Really? Not even water refills? Come on. Some places will refill your water or soda before you are even done with it. But both my water and Coke were gone long before I finished eating and empty they sat. Then when we were both done eating and our plates were completely bare of any food he finally comes back and asks if we need any take home boxes. No I think we finished all our food there buddy. He did finally bring over a Coke refill for me but that was when we were handing him the credit card to pay. Now I will so go back. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were having an off day. No one is perfect all the time. Maybe we had a bad waiter. But I was put off that they changed their menu and almost seemed to be going a little corporate. Step up the service guys and if it isn't broke stop messing with it. I have no problem with change but please don't change for the worse. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end of my favorite breakfast place.",

    "text": "I just discovered this wonderful breakfast and lunch spot, thanks to \"Yelp.\"  Like others of its kind, it features a generous four page menu of breakfast options.  First are the hearty skillets such as the southwest carnitas with tender pork, spicy chorizo, cracker's country potatoes, and shredded cheeses, topped with baha sauce and tomatillo sauce.  Next are  fluffy omelets such as the New Princess - lightly spiced with tender chunks of chicken sauteed with mushrooms, broccoli, bacon, and onions stuffed with cream cheese and topped with creamy hollandaise.  Sensational flavors for breaking the fast!  Prices range from $8.29-8.99.  Traditional items include huevos rancheros, and a variety of eggs Benedict.  Your taste buds will be California dreamin' with the California Eggs Benny, a fresh and bold combination. (spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes and two large poached eggs topped with hollandaise)  Last but not least, pancakes, Belgian waffles, European crepes, and blintzes grace the pages of this indulgent breakfast menu.  But the highlight is Cracker and Co.'s homemade desserts.  Wrap your senses around the cinnamon brandied blackberry bread pudding, raspberry chocolate fudge cake, or the Texas kahlua brownie.  Without a doubt, the most divine bread pudding to ever dazzle my senses!  As most breakfast and lunch spots, it is only open until 2:30p.  Expect a wait when coming here for brunch on the weekends.",

    "text": "This place is just ok. I found it on yelp, drove past it many times and never even noticed it. Go figure. Anywho, after reading some of the reviews thought we would give it a try. We're used to brunch in central Phoenix so this place was a little more casual. It was a nice overcast day so we sat outside. When we walked in we were seated fast. The waiter (Heath) was very kind. He was very efficient and quick.   For starters we ordered the big cinnamon roll. Um...it was medium sized to me but I'm used to the one they serve at St. Francis. However it was very tasty! They put too much frosting on it but it was easy to wipe off with a fork. Yup the cinnamon roll is a winner! I had the farmers scramble. It was way bigger than I thought it would be, probably because it was 85% potatoes. Don't get me wrong it was good but barley any meat, spinach, mushroom or even eggs. However it was good. I substituted pancakes instead of toast. The pancakes were good. Not amazing, just alright. The honey butter they put on top is a little bonus. My girlfriend got the \"Thrill of the grill\" sandwich and thinks there was nothing thrilling about this sandwich. She said the bacon was cheap and from my view it looked over cooked. She didn't like it. She did however like the baked potato soup she had on the side.   The patio experience was nice, mainly because it was a nice day. The tables were spacious and not crowded together so it was very comfortable. The tables are placed right under trees, which made me a little worried that a bird would top my food off with a little \"surprise\" but luckily the worst thing that happened was a leaf falling on the table... Whew! Before leaving the waiter asked if we would like coffee to go, I thought that was really nice :-) he definitely squeezed a little more tip from my pocket with that line. (SMH flattery gets you everywhere with me)   All in all the place was \"OK\". I wish I could have had a Mimosa or Bellini with my meal but I'll get over it. The place is close to our dwelling and inexpensive. They have a lot on their menu so I think I'll give this place another chance one day. (When I'm on a budget AND not drinking)",

Service was lackadaisical at best.  All their food comes from some sort of restaurant supply company and is then reheated and served.  Not sure where the rave reviews here come from--must be Americans who can't live without food loaded with salts and other preservatives.  Final tally over $40 for two people--no drinks.  I could have prepared a better breakfast at home with grocery store ingredients--and I'm a horrible cook.

I love the Catalina tuna melt to bits of fishy pieces. The french toast is a cinnamon-marbled marvel. Even the coffee is surprisingly good, and I drink it black. The only thing I ever had off the entire menu that I disliked was the huevos rancheros, but I think they've changed the recipe since. The service is always pretty prompt and there's never too long of a wait.",

She said her benedict was delicious.  I found the traditional breakfast to be fairly average.  Bacon was good.  Scrambled eggs and potatoes were bland and needed a fair amount of salt.  I had subbed a biscuit instead of toast and the biscuit was pretty decent.  Overall service was pretty good, food not bad.  I would probably come here again if I was in the area but would prefer to try the lunch menu next time.  When we left there was a huge crowd outside of people waiting to get in so it's clearly a pretty popular place.  We had no wait when we arrived shortly after 10:00 on Sunday morning.",

Today our togo food had cheese when we specifically asked for no cheese due to my boyfriends dairy allergy. Finally we have decided to never come back. Spend your money elsewhere. I truly don't understand how this place has 4 starts. Never had a bad experience at first watch so that's where we will continue to go.",

Sadly with a table this large our food came out in rounds but all arrived within a reasonable amount of time. The room fell silent as it was obvious everyone was enjoying their food. Everyone fully enjoyed their meals and only a few didn't make the clean plate club. A great place to meet for large groups for breakfast and the food was good and hearty. Definitely will return!",

And, even when it's crowded on weekends, you still don't find yourself waiting too long.  Their French Toast is RIDICULOUS--a gigantic portion of deliciousness. They have some southwestern skillet type that's pretty amazing; and the Eggs Benedict is quality too...as well as most of the other items I tried. Although, if I had one complaint, it's that the food never really comes out piping hot. It's not cold; it's just not super hot either. I like to see steam rising from my plate.  When I want a big weekend breakfast, this is where I head. It might not blow you away, but it's good (and the best breakfast option we have around these parts).",

I just wish I lived closer so that I could come more often.",

You would think it's a distant relative of a Macaroni Grill or an Olive Garden. BUT, give this place a chance. I did, and, boy am I glad I did!  Southwestern chorizo skillet it has to be. It's a delicious medley of cheese, salsa, eggs, potatoes and chorizo. There was absolute silence, at the table, until we mopped up the last juicy remains of pork carnitas and tomatillo salsa with the corn tortilla. A perfect 'when the food does all the talking' moment.   The daily special apple crumble French toast while delicious was a sugar overload, and, the overpowering smell of egg put me off. I could blame my unforgiving sense of smell, but, it's definitely not a repeat order for me.  Service was spot on. Friendly, patient and more importantly, non-intrusive. I say that so often because, I detest nodding in approval incessantly during a meal to a stranger who (let's be real here) couldn't care less about your taste buds having a good time.",

We waited 30 minutes for a table just to find several empty tables they weren't even bothering to fill. Our waiter came over very promptly, took our drink order and I ordered a side of bacon for my son so he would have something while we waited. It took 20 minutes for the bacon to come out, the waiter got that order wrong (how do you mess up a side of bacon?). We placed our order after a few minutes and then waited another 20 minutes for our food to come out while our waiter was chatting with other wait staff. The manager brought our food to the table to find out it had all been sitting on the warmer and our food was actually cold. The waiter never came back by to ask how the food was or make sure we had what we needed, including needing refills on our drinks. He came by just as we finished to drop off the check.   Maybe the food would have been better during a less busy time but I'm not willing to go back and try. Very dissapointed and will make sure to tell others about our experience.",

    "text": "There I was at Discount tire early this morning hoping to be at least one of the first 3 to get in. Well that didn't happen so I realized I needed a place to go. And there was Crackers across the street. Ok maybe not right across but close enough to walk.  The first thing I saw as I approached was a big line of chairs outside. That might mean people like this place??   Apparently because it was busy. But I got a great seat near a window and service was excellent. The waitress knew her menu and made recomendations when I asked. She even knew to ask me what I generally liked and was I looking for that or somethng different. Smart!  In the end I ordered the same thing I have for 50 years, eggs, bacon, tomatoes and toast.   Service is great, no blaring music, servers who pay attention but don't hover, good coffee, and busy with people who look like they return a lot.  Breakfast is pretty hard to screw up but the bacon and the eggs are the give a way. Crisp doesn't  mean burned, and over mediam means soft yellow but finished egg. They got it absolutely perfect. Even the toast was warm, when it was delivered.  Now I have to add them to my list of regulars like the Hoosier Cafe in Chandler wher I go every Sunday.",

Being familiar with the menu, I decided earlier in the week that I would venture back memories' lane for a few of my faves.    I started with a cup the Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup which taste exactly how I remembered it from back in the day. Still hot, still savory, still delish! My friend and I split the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes and I could have honestly died right there right then. So good!  For my main meal I ordered the Country Fried Steak Biscuits and Gravy. The steak was very tasty and the country potatoes were griddle fried to perfection.   I made it half way through my main meal and decided to pump the brakes and suggested we split the daily bread pudding special but the response I got was, You! Can't! Be! Serious!  So we decided to save that for another time.   Later that night I had the other portion of my breakfast for dinner. I slept well.",

It was not a corporate chain that we knew of and we are all about supporting the local businesses and community.   When we walked in, we were greeted immediately by a friend hostess and two workers that were standing at the hostess stand. We were sat immediately (we beat the morning rush) and were greeting almost immediately by a very friendly server by the name of Melissa.   I had the Southwest Chorizo Carnitas and my friend had the California Eggs Benedict with steak (the steak was an extra charge). Both were amazing, had great flavor, presentation, and hearty portions.   The prices are just a tad pricey. Just under $10 for most breakfast items. Even though the portions are nice, I feel that breakfast should not be quite that much. If the items were about $2 less it would have been perfect. The food and service were above par so I am not going to deduct for pricing.   Everything was great from beginning to end and it felt great supporting a local business.   If you are wondering where to have your next breakfast, try Crackers & Co Cafe. You won't be disappointed.   Happy Eating!",

We waited 40 minutes outside (which is not rare) and then we waited 45 more minutes to get our food. When we asked the waitress if it would take much longer she said there were 7 people in front of us in line. We asked to see the manager who took a while to come out so we ended up leaving. The waitress even charged us for the orange juice we had! I am all for paying what you order but I would expect an apology and  that's eat. I will make sure my acquaintances know about this horrible service and we will never come back.",

Knowing they put very little mayo on their BLTs I asked for extra mayo which they eventually brought.  The table next to us had 4 young men whom the waiter knew, so even though they sat 15 minutes after we did, they got regular service while we got ignored.  We eventually got our food even though we had to ask for silverware after the food was brought, which came after the table next to us got serviced again.  I was surprised when I got the check to see the extra mayo was on the bill.  While it was only 59 cents I asked the waiter why I was being charged for something on the menu and listed as part of the sandwich?  The reply I received is they \"have to\" and that was it.  I could care less about the 59 cents but I wonder if the irritation is really worth it to management?  The little things like the extra charges, not having silverware and the super slow service will just probably lead to us choosing some other restaurant next time.",

Fruit is always good! It was fresh & their fruit dip was addicting. We didn't anticipate the wait being 45 mins long! As our server came around, he offered us complimentary muffins! So we each got one & shared with each other. We got blueberry, pistachio & carrot! They were all so freaking good!!   I got the southwest eggs Benedict & man are they good! So fatty & greasy but it hit the spot, for real. & their potatoes are amazing. Nice and crispy. Perfectly seasoned! The portion was decently generous. Overall, It was worth the wait!",

They were super packed and had a line out the door!! However, we left our name and hung out with the rest of the people and before long (about 20 minutes) we were seated.  The waitstaff was all courteous and efficient. There was some difficulty with the kitchen putting up our food in a timely manner but the waitress quickly fixed that. They were extremely helpful with our child (we had a four year old) who was being a bit picky with his breakfast. They replaced his egg with a scrambled egg at no charge and we greatly appreciated it!  Kids!  I got the 2 egg traditional breakfast with sausage (they were delicious!!) and my guy got the berry blintzes or crepes, I can't remember which they were. Looked like dessert to me!! Everything was delicious and served at the right temperature. They keep a variety of creamer for your coffee on the table as well as jams (I tried the blackberry!) Another great perk here is they leave a pitcher of hot coffee on the table for you so you don't have to beg for a refill, it worked out perfectly and we each had three cups of coffee in quick succession with NO waiting. Loved it!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast place that we will for sure go back to. The food, service, and ambiance were all perfect. Try it today!!",

    "text": "I like fruit and vegetables to go with my breakfast. Guess what Crackers has? Fruit instead of potatoes for only $0.99! The fruit was delicious and fresh. The melons were really good and the strawberries were typical of this late in the season. I liked them, but not as much as when it is height of the season.   I had the spinach omelet with bacon. What a combination. I have been all over for breakfast and have not had this combo! It was topped with swiss cheese which I thought I would not like but was willing to try it. It was a good touch to the bacon, spinach, and mushrooms.   The service was great and we beat the Sunday breakfast crowd. The restaurant is comfortable and clean. Our food was brought out quickly and hot.   Something I always look for when I go to breakfast is the amount of strawberry jams they offer. This place keeps a full stack available. Why this is important is because as a child I hated when they were out of strawberry jam. This happens often. I don't eat the jam any longer, but I still rank a place higher when they take the time to make sure they have strawberry jam. They also have blackberry which Brad and I tried. Not my cup of tea, but apparently someone must like it since there was plenty of it too.  Brad ordered the carnitas skillet. It was a LOT of food. He could only eat half. He was surprised by the tortillas because it was not a thin, pale, cold, tortilla. It had some flavor and weight to it without being too thick. The carnitas and potatoes were spicy enough for him. The green chile was good, but not hat like at home, but for Arizona it passed. He also liked the salsa.  The thing he liked the most was the one piece of french toast. It was HUGE!!! Looks are also deceiving. I saw it and thought that it must be heavy, but it was not. It was light and fluffy and good. I can always tell how good things are by how much syrup he uses. He did not use much. The added touch was also warmed up syrup brought to him with his french toast. He licked the plate and was satisfied.  I have waited to visit this place since I moved here in March. It was worth the wait!",

    "text": "WOW! What a pleasant surprise! I was in the area for work and wanted to stop and grab something for breakfast, something other than your traditional chain restaurants. I was craving something hardy, something with some substance, and not looking for your typical bagel and cream cheese breakfast. I didn't read any reviews on Crackers and Co I just saw the restaurant, the name caught my attention, and I decided to make a move...  First off, the staff was extremely welcoming (this is huge for me). They greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and made sure I had a menu in front of me within seconds of being seated. Taking a look at the menu, it has a lot of Mexican influence, which was definitely a good thing. After taking a glance over the menu, I went with the waitresses recommendation... the Southwest Chorizo and Carnitas skillet.   WHOA! This thing was HUGE! It was loaded with potatoes, carnitas (my fave), spicy chorizo, jack cheese, two monster eggs that were cooked over easy, fresh salsa, and a tortilla. Taking a handful of bites of the tortilla with a couple bites of the skillet, I knew I was going to be in trouble and not be able to finish it (and I am a big guy).   What a great find! I am in the Tempe/Chandler area 2-3x a month and I would MAKE SURE if I am in the area for breakfast, I would stop here... this is definitely one of those places that you come back to because of the good food and a great customer experience.   Side note, hats off to the management team, there was a small issue with my order and they took care of it immediately!  I'll be back!",

    "text": "I will never step foot in this place ever again. Yesterday, I came here for breakfast as me and my husband had a really good experience the first time we came here. So yesterday, my husband casually asked our server if the sever who waited on us the first time was working. I won't mention the server's name out of respect. Let's just call the server John. So, John was our amazing server the first time we came here. Anyway our sever said he wasn't working that day. She asked us why are we looking for John and I told her that John mentioned to us before that the next time we come back, just ask for him as he would like to give us a free cinnamon pancake. Apparently the server promptly brought this information to the manager and the manager came over to our table and told us that John shouldn't have offered the free pancake as servers need the approval of the management first. Frankly, I could care less about the free pancake, the manager can shove it up her behind. I don't think it's necessary for her to inform us as customers what should and shouldn't be approved within their staff.   As if this wasn't enough, throughout our meal our server that day (She's Filipino by the way) kept coming to our table and told us over and over again not to worry about what the manager said and not to worry as John will not get in trouble. I was like, why should I be worried if John will be in trouble? As far as I'm concerned, John didn't do anything wrong and frankly I don't care! I just want to eat my food and enjoy my breakfast.   It was just a really horrible experience. It's so much unnecessary drama caused by the manager and the server. I vow never to come back here again. Besides, their food is not all that. IHOP serves better breakfast in my opinion.",

Everything was garden fresh, cooked perfectly, and so good. The California Benny is Eggs Benedict with avocado and fresh spinach and so very good. I could have easily shared this plate with someone else. I was too full from just one of them (two come) that I didn't even have room left to eat those yummy potatoes!   My husband had the carnitas with chorizo and potato egg scramble. I think if we had been alone he would have licked the plate.   There was no room left in our bellies to try the desserts but they all looked wonderful!",

Even though I am a HUGE fan of clam chowder, I must claim my love for their chili is deeper, sorry Mr. Chowder. I ordered their Southwest Carnitas Plate.  OMG, if love is found in a man's stomach...cracker's will you marry me?  I dissected the plate.  Wanting to gain the experience of each individual item. can you say \"Y-U-M-M-M-M-Y\"?  The chorizo was great, nice flavor.  it was that pork that I found very drawn to.  Beautifully cooked and seasoned.  Very moist! You just have to try it!!!!  On second thought...NO, don't try it because I dont want them running out of this item due to its popularity.  I am just glad they dont advertise.....

    "text": "Why? Why is your turkey melt a cold sandwich with melted cheese? This review is long overdue. I haven't been here for about 6 months, when I was pregnant. But, I have been eating a Crackers for years, since their original location opened and have always gotten decent tasting food.  I guess my gripe is really with the menu. I very carefully selected the turkey melt from the menu because I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich. Unfortunately, I was a high risk pregnancy, therefore I followed my doctor's directions to a T! \"No cold meat\" due to the bacteria listeria that can be found in cold meats. So, by the time I got my sandwich I was starving and was most of the way through the first half when I realized the meat was cold. I asked my husband to make sure I wasn't crazy before I called the waitress over. Let me just say, I worked in the food industry for years and I don't like sending food back... Anyway, the waitress told me the turkey melt is always cold.  What? Every restaurant in my life that I have ordered a melt, it is hot. I felt ridiculous sending half of a sandwich back to be heated, but I wasn't eating it cold. She had to ask her manager what to do. Luckily, someone the kitchen was nice enough to make me half of a real turkey melt. Please either change your menu and call it a turkey sandwich, or let people know they are ordering a cold turkey melt.",

I went with one of the house specials....the carnitas chorizo southwest skillet.   I was full about half way through the dish but since it was so good I just had to eat it all.    My wife got the Euro 222 which comes with crepes, bacon and eggs.   We also got a fruit plate which was a great variety of fruit along with a yogurt type dipping sauce. Highly recommended.  Service and atmosphere were nothing special but overall I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area and looking for a breakfast spot",

Once we were seated, our waiter came to get our drinks order promptly and came back soon after to get our food order. There were 4 of us & we ordered the California Eggs Benedict, the Southwest Eggs Benedict, the Day Break, and Bandito Omlet.  For whatever reason, everyone's food was brought out before mine & I didn't get it until about 5 or 7 minutes later. My dish was the California Eggs Benedict which was just alright. The bacon was crispy and tasty but the hollandaise sauce along with everything else was pretty bland. I also had asked for the side of potatoes to be extra crispy but they were not .. Or I guess only about half were. I'd say that for the quantity, the price was worth it, but not so much for the quality of food. Everyone enjoyed the items we had ordered but no one was overly excited about them. All and all, it was just okay.",

Oh well, it was an honest review and that's the beauty of Yelp. It gives us a platform to say \"this place sucks.\" If I get another complement/message I'll let you guys and Yelp know about it.   Horrible, horrible, horrible. I heard such great reviews about this place.  I had eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was so bland and so were the potatoes.

The water that they brought us was tap water that wasn't even filtered. Also they had radio on that was playing only commercials, and only one song playing may be every 10 minutes. Who would want to hear commercials instead of music at a restaurant? When I go out to eat I like to enjoy nice atmosphere and food. This place didn't have neither.",

The breakfast sandwich is another mouth watering breakfast offering.  Lunch however was disappointing. My lunch companion and I ordered the Spinach Artichoke soup which was the consistency of paste and should have been served with Chips for dipping.  I ordered the Poblano Chicken Melt,  w Pepper jack cheese and a garlic mayo.  Disappointing was the flavor of the chicken breast as there was none. It didn't even taste salt and peppered. The garlic mayo was minimal and lastly the charring on the Poblano pepper was over powering and bitter. The bun however was fresh and the only item I somewhat enjoyed. Breakfast is definately Crackers strong suit and I will be back for that. But sorry  lunch is a no go",

The pork was so tender; covered with jack cheese on a bed of potatoes, heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the bacon! I have had some of their soups before, and let's just say, the Cream of Spinach & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and creamy, it is like eating dip without the chips!

Service, like I said can be good, ok or \"what the hell is going on?!\"   Last time I had my waiters switched and the first one keep taking stuff from our table (silverware, syrup etc) to give to other tables! Then the second one would get pissed. Both of them had an 'I rather be somewhere else\" attitude  So, the food is 4 stars, the service anywhere from 2 to 4.",

I had the California Eggs Benedict with the Crackers Country Potatoes. Simply put, it was amazing. The house coffee is smooth and comes with your choice of flavored creams. My husband had the Vatican Skillet and was very pleased with his choice. The only real down side is the very limited operation hours (7am- 2:30pm) which makes the wait times a little more than I usually want for breakfast but it was very worth it.",

If that's how clean they keep the areas of the restaurant that the customers use and see, how clean do they keep the kitchen?",

You get in and out faster than you would expect when you see the mob hanging around the hostess' stand, but you don't feel rushed to give up your tables.   They're in a location that has been several other restaurants before this, so I hope they have the right combination to appeal to a steady breakfast/lunch crowd.  BTW, I'd probably give them four stars but their ice tea is lousy. Yuck.",

In hindsight I can say, no wonder it was so busy.  Busy does not always mean good. My husband loves steak so I suggested he order the Top Sirloin Steak Benny.   My husband wanted his steak cooked medium but it came to the table literally \"bloody\" and the blood contaminated the muffins, egg, etc.  Yuck. They offered to recook the steak and we noticed then how sinewy and gristly the steak really was.  It was an inferior cut of meat and only a little better. The side of country potatoes were cooked in some type of lard rather than vegetable oil as they were really greasy and very bland. The bill says we ordered a dish called Traditional yet the price is for the Top Sirloin Steak Benny.  I don't like things misleading.  As to the coffee, it was really weak yet it's $2.69.  The diner to the left of me left half her Spicy Mexican Breakfast on the table.   Me, at first not so hungry chose not to eat there after seeing my husband's order.    I left a comment about the \"bloody\" steak on the credit receipt and they never reciprocated.  Guess they think they're OK.  And guess where we won't be going again!",

To start, they have delicious coffee which is always a nice way to start the morning. My favorite dish is the California benedict with avocado, spinach and bacon. The ingredients are fresh and theprtion sizes are hearty. I've also tried other dishes such as the cinnamon roll French toast and crepes which were also yummy.

The Hay straws are so much better that paper because they last and don't get soggy like the paper ones do. So many other great points to this little business I don't have time to go into but wow, I love supporting a business like this one! Oh one other thing, the employees, so friendly and helpful.

I forgot to ask for my potatoes to be extra crispy, so they were a bit soft for my taste. So be sure to note that if you want crispy potatoes.    My companion had the classic Benedict, and she ate every bite!  The hubby had their special French toast with apple cranberry which comes with bacon and eggs.  He was a little disappointed with the French toast. It was the thick bread which is not his preference.    Love the little carafes they give you for coffee refills.  And choice of creamers. They also have a bar for mimosas and bloody Mary's as well as other adult beverages.    We will be back.",

My daughter found Crackers on Yelp (she's learning from the best. Hahah).   We walk in and nothing really stood out to me but a bunch of people outside waiting to be seated. Host was nice and told us that it would be 15 minutes. We got seated in about 15 so that was cool.   When I try a new breakfast joint I try to find something that they are known for. Anyone can make an omelette so... I tried something off of their September Specials menu. Brown Sugar Banana Cakes with two eggs and bacon. The pancakes actually had slices of bananas cooked inside. I really couldn't taste the brown sugar. So they weren't too sweet which is good for me. Dumping the syrup on these cakes made it pretty good. Not great pancakes. Didn't really stand out but good. I had two scrambled eggs with a couple of strips of bacon. Bacon was thick and pretty good. I also got a side of Corned beef hash. It was okay. Nothing special.   My daughter was going to order an omelette but I convinced her to figure out if this is a good places or not. Anyone can make an omelette. So she decided to try the Crab Cake Benedict. It came with two crab cakes and some sliced potatoes. I grabbed a bite and it was pretty good. My daughter really liked it. Ate one Crab Cake and gobbled up the potatoes. Took the other Cake for another day. She did say that the Crab Cakes were not even close to when she went to Maryland but this is AZ and she liked it. So it was good.   The service was pretty good. Our server greeted us right away. Got us our drinks and coffee. Checked up on us and got our food out pretty quickly. So I was cool with that.   So overall, good food and good service. The atmosphere didn't really stand out to me. Standard breakfast joint. Nothing special. We got out of there in about an hour or so. So perfect timing when our car was fixed. So not bad. Would I come back? Possibly. If I'm around the area but wouldn't go out of my way to get there. Enjoy.",

I have tried the Vatican, greek and chorizo and have never been disappointed.  great place overall, good quality and good prices.",

I noticed there are a lot of chairs outside the restaurant, although they weren't busy at all when we arrived, I bet they get really busy later on the day.  In fact when we left the restaurant around 9:30am they were about 80% full.  I had Southwest Egg Benedict. Spicy chorizo patty went well with avocado. It was just a bit spicy but it wasn't overwhelming at all. It was just right and tasted good. Poached egg was cooked perfectly. When I cut it half I was really happy to see slightly runny yolk. Adobo Hollandaise sauce tasted good too. While I really enjoy traditional Hollandaise sauce, this southwestern flavored complimented the egg benedict pretty well.  Coffee was blah... just what I anticipated. I would skip coffee next time, and will get a cup of coffee afterwords somewhere else.",

It's hard not to like Crackers, given the menu has a wide variety of items suited to most every palate.    I find myself ordering the Chicken Enchilada omelet more often than not.  The chicken inside the omelet is so perfectly spiced inside that I always regret it when I DON'T order it.  I think there's one other menu item that uses this chicken, but I have yet to try it.  The muffins are amazing, with the blueberry one being chock full of giant blueberries.    Even the toast is worth noting, as the homemade raisin toast is a specialty you won't want to miss.  Everyone I've brought seems to love the California Eggs Benny.  I've never tried it since I am not a fan of Hollandaise Sauce or Poached Eggs  and I'd have to make too many substitutions.    The service is friendly, though on my last visit the waiter was in such a hurry he took down DD's order wrong.  It was not a problem, since she loved her dish anyway and both were the same price.    We tend to go here with people visiting from out of town or if we have other business in the area.  Do I make regular trips here just because?  Sure.  But personally I don't like to spend a lot of money at breakfast and Crackers is more on the moderate side than inexpensive.  One thing to note, it is often VERY COLD in the dining room.  Bring a sweater if you are temperature sensitive... even in the Summer!",

I ordered hot tea as part of a plan to stave off an oncoming cold (didn't work) and was presented several options in a box.  Nice.  Opting for the lunch menu, I chose a roast beef, tomato, avocado melt (not what it was called on the menu, but the name has slipped my mind).  It came with a side salad and a pickle spear.  I absolutely loved that sandwich.  Hot, it was an A+.  Leftover for lunch later, it was a solid B+ still, and I didn't even warm it up.  I'd go back for that sandwich alone.",

We like it's central location, the fact that it's locally owned (an old coworkers family owns it) and that their ingredients seem fresher and not Denny's-like at all.  The ambiance is good for a couple eating breakfast/brunch/lunch or a whole gang of gals (like us).  The tables have good enough spacing so that when my loud-ass sisters and I get together there, we aren't completely annoying those around us (yah, and we do get loud, I tell ya!).  Their staff has always been attentive and we've always tipped well because we know we are plenty to deal with.  I do wish that they were more consistent with their breakfast fare.  I have always ordered a variation on the standard Eggs Benny (one of my faves!) and they always seem to come out different each time I've ordered them here.  The muffin isn't toasty and is instead soggy or is super toasted; the hollandaise is tangy or it's super tangy; the potatoes are crispy or they're soggy... it's a gamble if I'm going to enjoy my food or find something off about it.  Sadly, because of the inconsistent food product, my sisters all voted this upcoming quarterly brunch to find a new place to replace C&C.... so, now I'm on the hunt for a comfortable, locally owned, affordable, filling breakfast that can put up with 11 women.. yeah, good luck, right?",

Wife got crab cake Benny with regular hollandaise sauce ( what is it with people adding stuff like dill to a perfectly good sauce anyway). I got chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy.  We both had order envy, You know when you try a bite of someone else's food and wish you had ordered that instead... so we switched mid plate.   Crab cake Benny was a new fangdangled version of eggs benedict. English muffin, crab cake, baby spinach, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. Served with breakfast potatoes.   Country fried steak with biscuits and gravy was pretty much what it said. A tower consisting of very good biscuit average chicken fried steak, ok sausage gravy and 2 eggs my style(over medium no snot).  Served with breakfast potatoes.    Breakfast potatoes were potatoes with an identity crisis..  they didn't know if they wanted to be hashbrowns, tater skins, or mashed potatoes. But pretty blah and completely lacking seasoning of NY kind.  Service was pretty slow as well. They brought drinks pretty quick but I swear they had to wait for the boys from the time bandit to catch the crab for those crab cakes. We waited 40 minutes for our food to come out.   Not sure if I would come back here or not, most likely not.",

Crackers is our default. For a long long time I got the New Hampton every time I went. Then they went and changed the menu on me! So now I rotate between the new princess, eggs Benedict and the breakfast burrito. My daughter always gets the biscuits and gravy and it's fantastic. The pancakes and French toasts are spot on also.   Their coffee is excellent and I LOVE that they have actual vanilla creamer.   The only downside is that it gets very crowded on the weekends. I hesitate to go during peak hours but they I start thinking of that perfect hollandaise sauce dripping over perfectly prepared egg which is laying atop that just toasted to perfection English muffin and I wait no matter how long it takes!",

There was no communication between the two of them, so we called Bill out on it. He said he was just listening from behind the bar, while taking orders himself. Good food. Great service.",

I've had a few different items there: Onassis Omlet (very good), and another one hollandaise sauce (a little too rich for the morning, but good nonetheless). I've also tried some lunch items. I had the artichoke spinach soup, not really my favorite. It was too rich and thick - more of a dip than a soup. And I had some sort of chicken sandwich, it was good. But I wouldn't eat it again. I guess I mainly Like this place for their breakfast. It's delicious. My roommates and I crave it on the weekends and they have great specials too.",

It's either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!",

Their spinach and artichoke soup is to die for.  I took 2 servings of the berry bread pudding home once and it was absolutely beyond compare.  Unfortunately, the other times I have been there, I was not going \"right\" home so I skipped it. My only complaint is why charge me $2.69 for a soda when you are only charging me $8.49 for a large platter of eggs Benedict with home fries.  Yes, I know I can have refills but a) I didn't b) I could have gotten a refill and it could not have cost you more than $0.70.  Just seems way out of line to me.  Actually, looking at the menu, all the beverage places are out of line. I don't mind paying good prices for good food and I probably would not have noticed an extra $1.50 for the eggs Benedict.  Just food for thought.",

The bf and I will be living closer to this place soon and that could be dangerous. Mariah was a great server, super cute and friendly! I asked for a to go cup for my diet coke and she brought a giant cup already filled with diet coke yumminess! Score! \"To go\" beverages is something i can definitely get used to and seems to be an AZ thing.  I sampled the bfs omelet and potatoes and they were also flavorful and awesome. Cannot wait to go back! My mom will love this place when she visits.",

I came upon Crackers & Co. & based on the great yelp reviews & menu options, we decided to give it a try. We went there on a Sunday morning so the wait was only about 10-15 minutes for a table. The food came out promptly & the service was good. All of the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant & will definitely return again the next time we visit Arizona.",

If you enjoy French toast, you owe it to yourself to order the Daybreak. Cinnamon vanilla French toast with 2 eggs and bacon (or sub sausage). It's incredibly rich and tasty! Be ready for a nap afterwards.   My wife swears by the French Chick (chicken salad) or Bird to the Wise (turkey & bacon on croissant). She also goes for the potato soup every time.   Sometimes the service is a little slow, but this place is crowded during peak hours so arrive early or be prepared to wait a bit.",

Most of the times the host is on the phone/ busy when we go in and doesn't even acknowledge us which I don't think is best practice.. we get seated in decent timing nonetheless.   Servers have always been very nice though. The one we got last time (I don't remember her name, whoops!) gave me a sample of the OJ to see if I wanted to order it. I thought that was thoughtful.   I think the place has a surprise factor because you don't necessarily expect it to have delicious food considering the atmosphere isn't new or modern. It has an aged type of feel. Which doesn't attract me. I drove past this place for a long time uninterested because it doesn't draw you in. BUT thank goodness for Yelp!  The food has been yummy yummy every time I come. The only issue I've had is freshness. People want piping hot pancakes and waffles so they should really make sure they bring them out right away. I've experienced cold French toast, waffles and pancakes here. They're good tasting though!   & you expect fresh when the wait times to even get your food on the table are so long..   Anyway, last time I came my breakfast burrito was deeelicious! I was so happy haha. Now I can go along with my much healthier ventures in peace. Thanks Crackers & Co!",

My fiance and I came in to grab some breakfast. We were seated, and then greeted by our server Riley. Riley was great by the way. The manager, not so much. I would have left had we not already placed our order. I went to grab my glass of water and it spilled all over my lap. Our sever wiped down the table and was really nice about everything.   About 15 minutes later the manager appears and starts loudly talking to one of the buss boys about the water under our table. He decides to stand in the middle of the dining room and point at me, and then announce to everyone that there was water under my table. I politely told him I was aware and I had just spilled my water. He ignored my statement and walked off. The buss boy decides to crawl under the table and start wiping it up. Mind you I was wearing a dress and I did not want this man crawling underneath my chair considering he could probably see up my skirt.   I quickly got up, and told my fiance how embarrassed I was. The buss boy decides to comment how much water there was - like okay, great I know. My dress is soaking wet, I'm freezing and now I have a man at my feet making even more of a scene.   I have previously worked in the restaurant industry, and by no means is this how you should treat your customers. I was noticeably embarrassed, and even voiced that there was not need for the manager to point his finger at me or make a scene about it. The buss boy ignored what I had to say and walked off once he cleaned up our spill.   The manger did not return at any point during our breakfast to check on us, or apologize for his behavior. Although the food was good, we will not be returning.",

I personally would suggest not at peak hours though. Sundays around brunch time can be a nightmare.",

    "text": "This was the first time we had noticed Crackers & Co.  We were out early and decided to give it a try.  The Cafe sits in front of the Costco and close to a strip mall.  We were early.  We were seated right away.  There were many open tables so having to wait for a table wasn't necessary.  Thank goodness for that!  We loved the menu.  There were many choices for breakfast and the prices were very reasonable.  One order was for a cheese omelet.  It wasn't on the menu but other omelets were.  There was no problem getting this ordered.  It was absolutely delicious and covered in cheese.  The other order was for ham steak, two perfectly cooked eggs and hash browns. The piece of ham was half of a dinner ham!!  It wasn't the processed piece that some restaurants serve.   Both orders were very good.  We had no complaints with the food and would definitely return because of the food.  The issue was not the food.  Our issue was with the service.  Coffee cups were totally empty without refills.  Trying to get the attention of our server (Mari) was difficult.  Finally I had to hold my empty cup upside down to get another server to let our server know.  Then, it seemed forever to get that cup filled even after she acknowledged the empty cup.  Why?  That time it was because she was multi-tasking. and we were thinking it was to save her steps.  Our breakfast was up and instead of filling our cups while we continued to wait, she either collected our breakfast, made coffee, poured it in a pitcher or whatever she did, it all arrived to together.  We weren't happy with the service and our tip reflected that.",

Passed on joining my teammates for lunch at Oregano's and order to go from them since they have Chicken and Dumplings.  I called and was told to give them 15 minutes. I shows up in 15 minutes and still had to wait about 5 minutes. The To Go person was very friendly.  So far not so bad, other than waiting for my soup.  I returned to the office to devour my soup. I pop the lid to the soup was so disappointed. No gravy but broth. No dumplings but 3 huge balls made of grits or farina. No chicken. I asked  separate people what my dish was and not one believed it was Chicken and Dumplings. Most assumed it was a vegetable soup.   I started to eat and was so grossed out. The balls are just too gritty for someone craving dumplings. The broth smelled gross and lack any real flavor. The vegetables were okay. I can't comment on the chicken because it had not one piece of chicken.    The one star is for the young lady behind the To Go counter, she was bright and friendly.   For the restaurant if you veer that far from a recipe you should state so in your menu. But then who would ever order stale grit balls in stinky broth?",

The exterior is rather nondescript, but once you step indoors you'll find that the decor has been updated since the facility was originally built. Albeit a bit dim inside, plus it's a bit strange to see the bar in one corner of the dining room, it makes for pleasant breakfast environment.  The service was polite and prompt and that California Eggs Benny (pictured) we're quite colorful, tasty and, I like to believe (due to the spinach,) healthy. I would definitely consider visiting this restaurant again.  My only criticisms are minor. The restroom was clean and neat although beginning to show its age due to outdated decor. I also didn't care much for the plastic tablecloths. I prefer solid (unprinted) cloth or no tablecloth at all. These, of course, are purely aesthetic and not major detractors.  Free WiFi would be nice for those of us who like to catch up on morning news via our smartphones.  Got a large family to feed for breakfast? Crackers maybe the place for you.",

    "text": "We came to eat on a Sunday, which is obviously going to be a busy time during brunch hours. We were able to snag a seat at the bar without a wait, so we were excited. The staff was SO frantic trying to handle everything that it took a while to put in our order and the guy who took our order was too busy to even stop to do it, so he did so while making some coffee drinks at the bar. Throughout our meal, he was yelling to different customers at and near the bar and talking out loud about all the things he had to do. Once the food finally came out, my eggs on my Eggs Benedict were room temperature at the most, so the whole dish was cold by the time I just began eating. My boyfriend had the crab cake Eggs Benedict and loved it, but I think it was the crab cakes that kept his dish warm. I couldn't even say anything to the staff because everyone was too busy to stop and talk to customers for longer than a second or two.  All in all, not a good dining out experience and I don't think I would come back since there are plenty of other brunch options in the area.  Three stars because they had a good menu selection (besides the fact they didn't have any non-dairy milk so I didn't order any coffee...), the food had good flavor, and I think there's potential here but they need to be better staffed and ensure food is making its way out quickly. Also, the man that seemed to be the manager was incredibly calm and kind and was supporting the staff as needed, which I think shows they had good support leadership wise.",

I had a denver Omlette replacing the ham with chicken adding mushrooms.  Really flavorful and scrumptious.  My sister enjoyed the waffle breakfast too.  Omg my brother inhaled the biscuit and gravy breakfast.    Our Server Amber was off the chain!  She NAILED the service that she provided to us. Very outgoing and friendly.  Super cute too!    \"Bye Felicia\"",

The food was amazing and the whole family enjoyed our meals which is rare when you have teenagers!

The omelette was delicious! It had a ton of broccoli which I love, and a lot of other veggies. A good amount of cheese, but not so much that it was too oily. It was really well done! This is a very cute restaurant where they take good care of you. I would highly recommend it, the only thing I would change was in relation to the pancakes. But I am a pancake snob.

    "text": "The absolute WORST. I am livid with this place. We were sat shortly after arriving and then ignored for 10 minutes at our table. Not hi, not a drink order, nothing. So I go up to the hostess and say that no one has acknowledged us for 10 minutes since we sat down. She said \"Where are you sitting?\" I said where you sat us. 10 minutes ago. She got our drinks, offered us a free cinnamon roll, and we said no. The waitress (no clue her name) finally came over after and we told her how annoyed we were. She avoided us other than bringing a pot of coffee after that as someone else delivered our food. I had just maybe 4 bites of our food (my husband probably half) when the Manager, Jim H. Came to our table and asked how everything was. I told him that we were angry, it's been a bad experience and he tried. He did. He offered to give us a discount, we said no we aren't asking for a discount. We will pay our bill in full we know it wasn't YOUR fault, we just want you to know how crappy this has been, food included. He laughed when we told her what the hostess said about \"where are you sitting?\" But we weren't amused. He could tell I was upset, BUT THEN.... he stopped speaking to me, turned to my husband and said \"I've been married 20 years, I know how difficult it is when a woman gets angry and trying to get her to calm down.\" I said well that's sexist. He immediately said no that's not how I meant it I'm sorry... he ran over to the register and came back to say \"I'm sorry, I tried to make it better and I made it worse. I comped your meal.\" We are livid at this point. I left and walked back in and asked to speak to who was above Jim. A \"co-Manager\" named Jennifer came out and she couldn't care less. I was obviously upset. I told her that this was awful. Gave us the normal \"I'm sorry you feel you had a bad experience\". And then proceeded to defend Jim and said \"he didn't mean it that way, he's a good guy... he has been married 20 years.\" I said \"I feel bad for his wife then.\" She then proceeded to say she's worked with him for a decade and that he is a good guy and she just thinks that wasn't how it was meant and she hopes we have a better day. She offered us food to go and we said no. We left. We called back and asked for the owner's information. Steve Luko, we are not going to let this go. You employ sexist, incompetent jerks.",

As for the food- I have yet to be disappointed. They have specials each month that are not to be missed.  A personal favorite of mine that is thankfully a menu staple is the Mediterranean Harvest Salad. Mixed greens with grilled chicken, kalmatta olives, radishes, tomato, cucumber, herb feta cheese.

We were immediately seated, which was a nice change of pace considering it was 9:30am on a Sunday morning. This is where the good ended. After we were seated we waited for nearly 15 mins for our server to arrive and take our drink order. We placed our drink order which included two hot lattes. The waters and chocolate milk that were also ordered arrived quickly. After 10 mins our coffee finally arrived lukewarm, no were near hot. At this point we placed our food order. We waited nearly 30 mins for our food. Once the food arrived it was discovered that our order had been prepared incorrectly and we did not receive what we had ordered. We decided to just eat what had been delivered rather than wait another 30+ mins for our food to be remade. The food that was delivered was again lukewarm and lacked the most basic of seasoning. We will not be returning to this restaurant. Very disappointed. I would not recommend eating here.",

The food itself was pretty decent; I had the classic eggs benedict with their potatoes and it wasn't anything spectacular, but it also wasn't terrible either.

Wow - they really need to put this gem on the menu as a standard. Thanks again for an excellent meal.   I ordered the 1/2 sandwich (chicken salad on 9 grain) with the soup, which turned out to be an outstanding combination. I had forgotten how good their chicken salad sandwiches are as well.   My 8 year old daughter didn't want anything from the kids menu, so we ordered her a plain, grilled chicken breast on a grilled bun. She was also in heaven. She actually said to me, \"Mommy, this is the best chicken I've ever tasted!\" LOL.",

After leaving and arriving home in Chandler, they called and said my card was found. It was very frustrating and a waste of part of my day for the inconvience of all the waiting and driving. Then the next visit there was a hair in my food. For now, returning to here is on hold.",

My husband had the California Benedict which he enjoyed.  I had the traditional breakfast with eggs and hashbrowns and bacon.  The bacon was the best part of the meal.  They didn't get my egg order right.  The kids had chocolate chip pancakes, which was basically pancakes sprinkled with chocolate chips.  The reason for only two stars is that the place lacks any personality, is a big open room with tables in rows.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal or the restaurant.",

    "text": "Spending time in this area with other people make it a lot more bearable. Something else that makes it bearable-Yelping good food.   My mom was leaving this morning and she wanted me to look up a good place for breakfast. We settled on Crackers & Co Cafe because it was close to her friend's house and we could pick her up. On the way over, though, my mom saw people were waiting outside and dropped me off so I could start waiting--good thinking! They took my name and told me it would be about 15 minutes.  20 minutes later, my mom and her friend arrived just as my name was called. We were seated promptly in a corner table under the some windows, with convenient view of 2 flat-screen televisions, both broadcasting CNN. A little distracting but whatever.   We were seated around 11 AM and by then my mom and I were no longer in the mood for breakfast foods. My mom's friend started with a Mango Iced Tea and I got the Strawberry Peach Iced Tea. They came quickly but tasted like something from a fountain or mix; very sweet and cool, but almost no tea-taste. They tasted fine, but I'm not sure that it was actually a fresh iced tea as it said on the menu.   We ordered:   Half-sandwich and soup: My mom got half a roast beef and provolone on wheat sandwich, with a bowl of Clam Chowder (usually only on Fridays but it was the Soup du Jour today). The roast beef was sliced very thin but there was a good amount, so much that my mom deconstructed her sandwich. The beef had a good texture but the sandwich overall was pretty bland. The clam chowder was delicious, thick and creamy but somehow still appropriate for a warm day because of the huge chunks of clams and mealy potato. Add a little Cholula and I'm all there (stole a lot of spoonfulls, actually).  Belgian Waffle: My mom's friend asked if the toppings were fresh and the waitress answered honestly that the blackberries and blueberries were frozen but the strawberries were fresh. It came hot off the griddle with butter and a good amount of topping, but no syrup--we had to ask and someone else, I believe a manager, brought it over promptly.   The Californian - I'm eating the leftovers of this sandwich as we speak.. which is roasted chicken breast, red onions, sprouts, avocado, tomato, and mayo on whole wheat bread. It was served with some really delicious fries; very crispy with a difficult to describe crustiness to it. Trust me, very good. The sandwich had a lot of flavor but you want to eat the pickle that comes with it for sure, to bring it together. I should've asked for mustard to be added but forgot. (Also, I just want to know why California-style food is associated with avocado? I love me some avo but it's not like Californians put it on their steak and in their drinks or something.)   Overall, the food was pretty good for the price, the service attentive, and the place busy but still conducive to pleasant conversation. Oh, and free refills on the drink. Hopefully I'll get another chance to eat here before I leave.",

The granola healthcakes, as they call them, were a bit different then what I was expecting too but they were still good none the less.

If your not lucky enough to get a spot at the bar or are dining with lots of people they do allow you to call ahead and put your name on a waiting list. The cafe is rather large but they seemed fully staffed to handle it well. The food was great, I loved my breakfast sandwich it was nicely and flaky and not overly oily. They also have egg substitute or egg whites only. The chef even did one egg and rest egg sub for me so that was nice. Also they're a lot of mostly healthy items on the menu. If your not looking for healthy than the biscuits and gravy were amazing.... Coming from me that's a lot because I hate biscuits and gravy. Nicely and peppery taste to them. I wasn't impressed with the pancakes but I think that comes down to personal preference because my husband loved them. Hubby also got corned beef and hash and loved that.

I'm sorry but it was flavorless and the only reason I knew it was a cinnamon roll was because that's what the menu said it was. I was not expecting Cinnabon goopiness, but something better than the wal mart bakery would have been nice.  I ordered the princess omelet which was actually pretty good. I love trying what a restaurants signature dish is or.popular item. This was tasty. The cream cheese kinda pulled it all together. However with my delicious omelet was sad, sad potatoes. No flavor, no crisp, just soft sliced potato. What a waste. Oh well.  So the price is decent for a breakfast joint. The menu is awesome. The food is mediocre, but maybe I just got the wrong day.",

    "text": "I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!  I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.  This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. I can't wait to go back.",

The pancakes are just ok, nothing to brag about.  If you're big on customer service, don't set your expectations high here. I've had the same server both times and there's room for improvement. It seemed as though she lacked proper service training as she slammed the plates on our on the table, brought the wrong drink after confirming it a couple times, and she just wasn't overall present. We had to prompt her to bring out our food after having to wait a while. When brought up to management (not to be comp'd but for just overall feedback), we received more excuses than apologizes.  I would be lying if I said I wouldn't go back or wouldn't recommend to others. The potatoes here are better than any breakfast/brunch place I've been to in the valley. I'll just have to manage my expectations and encourage others to do the same.",

It was about 7:30am on a Saturday and they weren't too busy.   I ordered the egg whites with chicken and veggies (I can't remember the name) and a side of Butterfinger pancakes. It was yummy, but I wish the candy had been cooked into the pancakes. It was all on top of the first one, so the second one was without candy, and on its own, it was kinda meh. The eggs were quite good and came with a cup of fresh fruit.   My boyfriend ordered a southwestern chorizo carnitas skillet and did not stop raving about it. He tried his best to finish it, but couldn't quite manage.   By the time we left, the place was filling up. I suspect it's the type of brunch place that has a wait between 9-12. Overall, tasty.  Enjoyable. Not spectacular, but worth a solid 4 stars.",

He responded, \"it's just we have 3 orders ready and I'm not sure which is yours.\" I got up and left. Awful service. Untrained staff. Obviously no order system that works. If I could give negative stars, I would. Stay away!",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   A couple months ago, I craved pancakes.  Although I mainly live in Scottsdale, it's only within the past few months that I've been home long enough to actually have enough time to try new places and not just places that my parents recommended or visit places where my friends work at or own.   Now I see how fortunate I was to grow up having parents that value great food and great eating experiences. Mostly, because, no matter where we were, even when we traveled, they did all the research to find extremely great places to eat. Research used to mean referring to bulky travel guides and book versions of Zagats for each city. Now research is pulling out an iPhone, jumping on the Internet, and opening up Yelp.  After I exhausted all the pancake places I knew, (IHOP, Wildflower Bread Company, Market Cafe at The Buttes, Morning Squeeze, Snooze AM, Butters and The Good Egg), using Yelp, I found incredible places (and increased from pancakes to crepes) like the Crepe Bar, T.G Eggington's, and Iss' Magic Mixes Oatmeal Cafe. I also found a couple places I didn't like so much. And today I found Crackers & Co.  CRACKERS & CO.  Crackers & Co. opened their first location in 1984.  Their website says that their menu was founded on the European heritage of the owner and has a warm, rural Tuscan ambience.  Currently, there are three locations: ~Eastgate (Country Club & US60) ~Mountain View (Greenfield & Brown) ~Tempe (Priest & Elliot)  THE STORY   This morning, I ate at the Tempe location.  When I walked in, I should have walked back out. Honestly, not because of anything wrong with Crackers & Co. but because it's just not a good fit for me.  The hostess was very sweet. I asked to sit at the bar and she helped me to my seat. There are two main dining areas and the place was very busy. The ambience included a lot of plastic vines and trees with vinyl table cloths, which was more like a nursing home than \"warm, rural Tuscan.\" There was a lot of activity at the bar for the take out and the radio was blaring local commercials and then Miley Cyrus. The bartender, Bill, was very nice and efficient. I ordered berry blintzes and a mimosa.  The $5 mimosa wasn't that great. It wasn't horrible either. That's when I started wondering what makes a good mimosa: Is it the fresh squeezed orange juice and quality champagne, or at least one or the other? This had neither. The orange juice was heavy and thick, cafeteria style. The champagne was hardly noticeable, but I was happy it was there. I ordered another.  The blintzes were at a disadvantage even before they came out, because I was raised by a Jewish grandmother who made THE best cheese blintzes. I asked Bartender Bill if the blueberry topping was compote. He said they puree the berries in back, so I said ok. The blintzes arrived covered in thick berry compote. Now there are positive and negative ways of looking at this. One positive way, is that they have extremely generous servings. Although I scraped it all off, I'm going to stick with that way of looking at it. After that, I ate them all and basically cleaned the plate, so that says something.  The menu was huge and there were also daily specials, which include many skillets, omelettes, pancakes, French toast, Crepes, waffles, oatmeal, cinnamon rolls, eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy. (In fact, I saw jalapeno biscuits and gravy which sounded tasty).  CONCLUSION   In summary, the staff was very nice, the food is good here if this is your favorite style of food, and you will be very happy here if you enjoy this type of environment.  3/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Crackers & Co. has take away, catering and gift cards. There is plenty of parking.   *Hours: 7am - 2:30pm Daily  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrackersandcompanycafe.com&s=ed88c7338989acc9ac05a45bce77a84317a5361145c647b46bde6605e5dc0b23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crackersandcompanycafe.c...</a>",

Now that I look back on my meal, I realized that I walked out with really nothing at all. This place didn't have a strong impression on me, let alone leave me with an everlasting need to go back. I'm definitely not dissatisfied, but I would recommend more than several other breakfast places to visitors of Tempe before Crackers.  I had a pretty standard breakfast of french toast (beautifully powdered with sugar), eggs, and bacon and tried several other items, including a steak/potato skillet breakfast and Eggs Benedict. Servings were huge which is a strong plus, but the menu was really large and lacked focus. I think if the place had fewer items on the menu that they did more... I don't know... extravagantly, I'd leave with more of a memory. If I was basing my review solely on South Tempe breakfast places, this place would be a solid 4 but definitely not any higher.",

Service is quick and friendly enough, the place is clean, and the food comes out quick.  They can get busy on the weekends.  The skillets are always good, and the California Benny (with spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes) is one of my favorites, and I'm not really an eggs benedict fan.  I've seen others get the breakfast burrito and the pancakes, all looked great and received great reviews.  Once, I got the Heart Scram (trying to be healthy) and it was alright, I just felt like it was missing something.  Cheese, maybe . . . cheese makes everything better, right?  The one time I went for lunch I ordered a Roma Tomato Chicken Melt (roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic marinated in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, grilled chicken breast and melted provolone cheese on grilled parmesan sourdough bread).  To be honest, the description sounded way more interesting than the sandwich tasted.  Very plain.  For my side I got the chipotle sweet potato soup.  It was pretty good, but on the spicy side (don't get this if you don't like spicy food).   As Arnold said, \"I'll be back\" . . . to Cracker for breakfast.   \"Hasta la vista\" to the lunch!",

Crackers seemed to have the best overall reviews.  The two slices of bacon were cooked differently.  One was slightly undercooked creating that fatty stringy chewy texture.  The other slice was half fatty stringy chewy and half burnt.  The pancakes were not good enough to finish.  The eggs are much better at IHOP or even Denny's.  The hostess sat us by the kitchen doors.  I prefer not to have people rushing around behind me whilst I eat so I pointed to the opposite corner and asked if we could sit OVER THERE.  She led us to the table next to the other set of kitchen doors.  I was ready to eat and gave up.",

They have the best patio and indoor look and feel. All the locations do look the same but the feeling you get from the Greenfield location is just somehow different. I have had most of the desserts and you really can't go wrong, they are all really good.  The waffles and pancakes are always delicious and why they have another form of pancakes called \"healthcakes\" I am not sure how healthy they really are! When I asked the server she mentioned little things that might lower the calorie content but nothing major.  The chicken enchilada omelet is really good and has a nice spice to it.  My only complaint would be that depending on who your server is you might get an attitude if you ask for substitutions beyond the standard cottage cheese or fruit they will offer. (Like asking for sausage instead of toast and potatoes) If you go on a weekend for breakfast be prepared to wait a bit.",

Try their huevos rancheros, which is very good but more on the mild-spicy side, or the cinnamon swirl French toast. They also often serve daily specials that are not on the regular menu, and I recall once ordering a fruit-topped French toast here that was simply delicious. When ordering an omelet, my choice usually has been the country garden, and it is really filling. They do have Cholula Mexican hot sauce available, which makes me happy, as many places just serve Tabasco. When I say that the portion size is remarkably large, I mean it. There have been times when I have joined family here for breakfast, and three of us opted to share one of their French toast plates. Trust me, it can be done, and quite comfortably.",

Had the Heart Scram, it was pretty good but could've used a lil more egg because the ratio of egg to veggie was heavy veggie. The fruit it came with tasted great, really fresh.  Service was okay, talked to her for my drink, order and she checked in once. Someone else brought the food out and she was nowhere to be found once I finished. I sat there a lil over five minutes hanging out (with an empty plate and glass) till the manager walked by and asked if everything was okay, said the food was great and just lookin for my check. He promptly got it and I was on my way.  I'd go there again for breakfast, like the classier atmosphere over a Denny's/IHOP.

Now, I've got nothing against church-going people, but at that time, that's the crowd you get -- grandparents dressed to the nines, their hair perfectly did, smelling like a rose garden on steroids; the kids are wearing one of their best outfits and are itching to take them off; the hungry babies are in full force...and then there's me and my posse, walking in the restaurant with dark glasses and ratty jeans, unshowered, with a hint of morning breath. A little out of place right?  I'm going to go ahead and call us a little \"edgier\" than the Sunday crowd.  But...the Red Velvet bread pudding...GO!",

Server was quick to greet us and brought our drinks just as quickly.   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (one of my favorite brunch items), and hands-down, this is the BEST I've ever had.  No kidding.  It's been 3 days and I'm still thinking about it.  The dish consists of beans, tortilla (I went with flour), green chilis, salsa, and 2 eggs (I got mine over easy) and you also get a side of potatoes.  The potatoes weren't mind-blowing, but the rest of the dish certainly was.  I'm not sure what made it so delicious, but it seemed that every little bite was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  Husband got the California Benny which he enjoyed, and our friends got a fruit platter (which looked very fresh) and a blueberry muffin (which was literally bursting with blueberries).  This was their 2nd breakfast of the day so they ate light - what a shame!  2 enthusiastic thumbs up for this place, and I can hardly wait to go back.  Of course since I'm going to have to order the Huevos Rancheros each time, I'll have to make hubby try the other menu items.",

    "text": "On the way back home from our \"little\" road trip, we spent the night in Phoenix and found this little breakfast spot the next morning.  Considering that the hotel we choose did not have a breakfast, we needed an alternative and this fit the bill nicely.  I can say Crackers is a great little spot for a fulfilling breakfast.  Service:  4/5  We were seated promptly after arriving at the restaurant.  It was a Friday morning so it was not particularly crowded.  I would say it was about two-thirds full.  On a Saturday or a Sunday, I would imagine it would be a bit more crowded.  Our waitress was fine, although a bit slow when it came to keeping our water glasses full.  My wife and I are not coffee drinkers and so she had water and I had a hot tea.  There was always someone around with a coffee pot, but getting water was a little more tricky.  Other than that, no complaints.  Food:  4/5  I was trying to eat semi-healthy, so I ordered the oatmeal with a bran muffin.  The muffin was served warm and was excellent.  The oatmeal was a good consistency, something I am a bit picky about.  My wife ordered an omelet and was satisfied with the amount of filling in it.  We also shared an order of crepes.  Now I had never had crepes before so I can't compare them to anything I've had before, but they were good... crispy on the edges with fresh blackberries and whipped cream.  Overall, a satisfying, better than average meal.  Overall Impressions:  4/5  Crackers is a comfortable looking cafe.  I'm a little biased against restaurants that don't have booths right now as that is the easiest way for my wife and I to sit with our young son.  It's interesting the kinds of things you notice or care about when you have to account for a baby.  But other than that, the atmosphere at Crackers is very nice and hospitable.  I would definitely say that Crackers is superior to our usual trip to the Waffle House when we are visiting Phoenix.  I enjoy supporting locally owned and operated restaurants over chains whenever I can.",

    "text": "Had a great experience with this restaurant. Just started working nearby and this will now be a local spot for lunch. First impression was great.  Waitress, restaurant manager were some of the most professional I've seen in a while. Unfortunately, the patio had recently been sprayed for pest control and given that we were the closest table to the patio we did find an insect crawling on the table. However, the manager came out, explained, apologized and made things right for us. This will definitely be a restaurant to come back to!",
