Good service but overall just okay.",

Not a huge fan of Saturday nights as it can turn into a night club after 10 but that shoe fits for others just not my cup of tea. We keep going back time and time again for a great time!  OK, so we've been back a few times after my first review and I have to RE-review the food....  On 1/26/17 We tried the chicken quesadilla Thurs night, (hard to screw up) however it was so salty I couldn't even finish one piece.  Another time before that we had the carne asada tacos and it had a funk to it. Didn't even taste like beef! I'm sure it wasn't the freshest of product this could have been why.  That said, we still enjoy the staff and atmosphere we'll just make sure we eat before going back.",

    "text": "Underwhelming.  AMBIENCE: It's sad to be the only ones seated at the bar watching sports on a Saturday plus Hockey night when ALL of Westgate is packed as is BJs and about everywhere else. We loved this place when it was Sandbar and kinda giggled at the schlopy remodel. It's called Cabin but adding one textured wall and a fireplace does not give it a cabin feel. Even when stocked with appropriate beverages. Basically they just covered the tents with camouflage paper. And why keep the dreadful noisy metal orange bar chairs? There's a bit of a more mature crowd as well. Thankfully the dirty pool is gone. The space is more open. And with more open means more smoke smell coming inside. Eck. And I'm straining my neck to see the TV which has serious lights blinding me behind it. Check out the photos.  SERVICE: Exceptional. Delivery of food was rapid. They brought napkins/silverware before we asked but failed to bring appetizer plates. They asked us multiple, almost annoyingly often, times if we needed anything or wanted the bar tender to make us something.  FOOD: Sadly, a favorite was not cooked well and excuses were given. We only ordered a Cabin favorite which the bartender said was a given good time based on no one saying bad things about the dish at their other location. We had the FAMOUS Cabin Torpedoes (almost couldn't check the title bc my menu stuck together-YUCK!). The cheesy meaty filling was a strange texture but my hubby said it's just meat. The jalapeno still had a bit of a crunch which was nice but not redeemable. Some of the jalapenos even had a kick. The downfall was the lazy broiler method of cooking which rendered the bacon on the sides and bottom of the pepper to be very underdone and inedible. And the sauce? We're not sure why it was there and felt it didn't help the dish.  When asked how we liked it, I honestly said the bacon was too underdone for our liking. Bar tender shrugged it off that if they cooked it more then it's too crispy. Honey, did you not see that half the bacon remained on our plates and was inedible? Oh, and for you bacon-nados, I call chewy bacon on a  bar appetizer inedible. Bar food should be crispy, salty, well seasoned, and gooey. Fail fail fail.  The second app, chicken skewers took a little longer to come out but still very quickly delivered. I don't like when people just walk around with your food a little unsure where to take it but fortunately they found us quickly. The taste was alright. Sugary coconut with a sugar dipping sauce. I'll pass. We asked for some sort of hot sauce and were brought Tabasco.  Final food thought-why is every dish dusted with paprika and parsley. Like two nothings still do not equal a something.  Redeeming possibilities include well advertised Happy Hour M-F 3-7 with $2 domestics, $3 wells, and 1/2 price apps.  Plus a reverse HH Sun-Th 10-close with &2 domestic pints, $3 wine, $3 fireball, and 1/2 off apps. And finally the Thursday night specials $2 domestic pint, $3 whiskey sour, $3 fireball, and $4 bombers.   Another note to fellow ANONYMOUS YELPERS HARASSING ME because of this post. I don't think that helps my post or this business and other dinners should be aware of this harassment. MARISSA: I don't dine alone and 4-2=2 just to try a dish. RANDALL: this is a far stretch from fine dining-it's a dance bar that serves food.   I've been here more than once and tried multiple dishes that make no sense (tomato sauce with bruschetta?). I think 3 stars is fair and well supported in my review.",

    "text": "I was recently there to celebrate my big brothers bday. I called in to make 2 table reservations for a Saturday night for up to 15 people. I called in the reservation Thursday, May 17th and then asked about bottle service. The lady on the phone quoted me $50 because the were running a promotion that Friday and Saturday night, she said. I said great, please place me down for bottle service. She grabbed all my info and when I came on that Saturday, there were already issues. I came in at 9:55, five mins before the tables should have been ready. They told me I needed to just wait for someone to clean my table. We get to the tables and it still was not cleaned off (that took an additional 20 mins after I mentioned something). The other table was given to someone else because they accidentally overbooked and who ever made the reservation didn't pay attention. So then they apologized and it was fine, no big deal because we luckily had enough elbow room and the tables are pretty big outside. But then when it came to ordering my bottle, the waitress came and told me it would be $180. This poor waitress was going back and forth being the messenger lady all because the manager didn't want to come to the table to talk about this matter. She said if we wanted to talk to her to meet her at the bar. Really? Professionalism at its finest, right?! That alone was blasphemy to me. This all boils down to the lady who took my original request to a reservation with bottle service. The manager told the waitress to tell me that the reservation lady May have told this to me the week prior. But no, I called that week before the weekend even started. Complete BS! The waitress was so sweet and I felt so bad that the manager would place her employees under situations where a manager should be stepping in. We were not, by any means, happy campers towards her and I did apologize because it was not her fault.",

If you agree read on, but if not then mabye you wont like it. Family outing to the Cabin. 12 people at long table. I see maybe 5 wait people walking around doing \"stuff\". I say \"stuff\" because there was 2 other tables besides ours so Im not sure what they were doing. We get seated at 1pm. 20min and the waiter asks me what I want to drink. Do you have a drink menu? I ask. No he says. Ok ill just have a soda. 20mins later I get my soda. Im getting hungry now so I want to order some food. 30 mins this time till he comes back around to ask what I want to eat. Maybe he is busy I say to myself so I look around and there is only one other table seated and 2 people at the bar, so no he is not busy atleast with customers. 40mins goes by and I get my crap cakes and my ribs. The food was ok..... I know better places to get what I got. I wouldnt go back. Its not a good place to go. It looks awful to. They tried the cabin theme but failed. Always go full cabin, not some half assed one. Cant wait to see them on bar rescue though.",

    "text": "Great place! We loved the ambiance! The place was pretty dead for a Sunday evening, but the live music was amazing! A young man was playing guitar solos with awesome covers of Tracy chapman and bob Marley. He's there every Sunday at 3pm we found out. We were excited to try the filet mignon, but we're actually disappointed when both of our steaks came out way overcooked. We normally never send food back but at $25 a piece we did feel it was necessary. The server was polite and said she would fix the problem immediately. A few minutes later the manager came over and agreed that our steaks were overcooked, apologized and said our meal was on him. I thought it was very nice to make us feel that we weren't just being picky and our complaint was justified. I know mistakes happen and when they are fixed with such generosity I insist on giving 5 stars. We will definitely be going back to see how the night crowd is!",

I have gone 4 times and I'm done its awful. The service is terrible ! Iv waited 30 minutes for a drink, the food and drinks almost never come out correct and the staff doesn't care at all. The waitresses started taking shots behind the bar the minute the owner ( who seemed like a very nice guy) left . Last night my food food came out way wrong , I sucked it up with the app but I couldn't eat my burger with gauc on it so she took that back comes back after everyone else is about done with a well done burger ( ordered medium rare) that's super dry and gross had 2 bites and I couldn't stomach it . They still charged me for the meal I clearly didn't touch. So if you are getting just drinks and want to enjoy the sunshine check it out with low expectations. For food I would not waste the money .",

My main complaint had to do with the ambiance. Unfortunately the outside seating allowed smoking so we had to change our seats and go inside.  They played music at a sound level that was painful to the ears. It was obvious they were playing the level for the outside customers. They need to invest in a sound system that has two sound level controls. One for outside and one for the inside customer enjoyment.",

    "text": "We visited at 4:30 PM on 3/14/15.   When the line at BJ's was too long, we tried The Cabin.  There was no wait.  Now we know why!  There were four people in our party.  We arrived at the hostess stand.  No one was there.  We stood there for a couple of minutes before someone came over and told us to seat ourselves.    Once seated, we waited 5 minutes before the waiter came over.  We placed our drink orders.  One water, one Shirley Temple, one Bud Light Draft and a Ginger Ale.  The water and Ginger Ale were fine.  The Bud Light had no foam/head on it at all.  Completely FLAT.  It looked like apple juice.  After explaining this to the waiter, he offered to put some salt in it to \"make it foam.\"  What?!  He brought back another draft beer that looked the same as the first.  That one was sent back as well.  We requested a bottled beer, as it was clear that something was wrong with the draft.   Either there was no CO2 or the glass was soapy.  A side note, the bottled beer was lukewarm.  After another person in our party tried the Shirley Temple, we knew we had encountered another problem.  IT HAD LIQUOR.   A Shirley Temple does NOT have liquor!  Although the person consuming it was over the age of 21, a non-alcoholic beverage was NOT ordered nor desired.  The waiter confirmed that it was made with Gin. GIN?!    The Shirley Temple was sent back and a Sprite arrived 5 minutes later.  FOOD:  We ordered:  mac and cheese balls, chicken wings, potato skins and a chicken quesadilla.    The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  It was all lukewarm.  It was all lacking in flavor.    The potato skins looked good but did not match the description.  The description said, \"potato skins loaded with house smoked brisket and chili and topped with sharp cheddar cheese.\"  THERE WAS NO BRISKET ON THE POTATO SKINS.  Also, the chili was really gross on the potato skin.  The skins had sour cream drizzled across them.  It would have been better on the side, not all over the top for folks that have allergies.  Mac and cheese balls were average.  The chicken wings were average.  The quesadilla was fair because the chicken inside was dry).    There were quite a few employees just standing around, yet the service was abysmal.  We were never offered a discount after the drink disaster or the delays.  Never so much as an, \"I'm sorry.\"   Interesting note:  the couple at the table next to us had difficulty as well.  We overheard the first beer being sent back and complaints about their food (pulled pork was apparently dry).  They were waiting for friends to meet them at the restaurant and actually called the friends and told them not to come.  We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are obviously quite a few issues with this place.  Hopefully this experience will be reviewed by management and appropriate changes made.  If not, I don't see this place lasting 6 months.  What a disappointment!",

So, we were pleasantly surprised that everything was so good. We were there for happy hour.  Everywhere that we have ever been let's you order happy hour prices until you leave as long as you were there before the end t ime.  They don't do that here, so you have to order as many drinks or food that you think you can handle before that. The service was very pleasant and efficient.  The food was delicious.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers.  My husband ordered a non spicy Bloody Mary, but it came out spicy.  He drank it anyway.   The bathroom was clean and well stocked, but I think that they forget to sweep and wash in the corners of the floor.   We will definitely go back again to try other items.  My husband thought that the deep fried mac and cheese balls were the best.",

    "text": "Bottom line, the death of this place will be the service. I had never liked Sand Bar and was happy to see something new in it's spot. My first visit was about 2 weeks ago. It was Saturday night and surprisingly empty, but somehow the service was still slow. We were greeted and brought our drinks quickly, but after telling our server we needed a few mins before ordering our entree, she disappeared for a good 15 mins. When she returned all she did was awkwardly stand there and say \"hey\"... so I ordered the Black Bean Burger with Onion Rings and my Dad ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich. Damn, it was really good! Despite being confused by our servers attitude and flighty demeanor, we were pleased with our meal. I decided to give this place another shot tonight. My boyfriend and I were celebrating an early Valentines Day and he had never been. Again, we were greeted promptly and by the SAME server I had the last time. She brought us our drinks promptly and low and behold, disappeared. In this time, we watched a table next to us get up and leave after 15 mins of no service. It seems like they are gravely understaffed or have hired unqualified people for the positions. I ordered the Turkey Burger this time which was just ok.. My BF's Pulled Pork sandwich was flavorful but dry, and we were left thirsty many times. A pro, good draft beers, but only managed to get 2 beers in the 2 hours we were there. Seemed like we were just being ignored but heard other tables complain of similar problems with different servers... I really want this place to succeed. I enjoy it more then the meathead bouncers and airhead servers over at TK's.. So please, get it together.",

Our drink order came out in a timely manner the first time, after that it took at least 20 min to see our server and another 20 min to get our drinks. I seriously thought she forgot about them.  When she came back she blamed the bartender.  Not cool, especially since they weren't busy.  We did overhear our the host offer our server another table while we sat and she accepted but clearly couldn't handle the 2. She then complained that she had another bigger table outside and they they had her running.  What about us? Throughout our experience she disappeared for long periods of time.  Only half our table got their food while the other 2 in our party waited for theirs again almost 20 min. Never again, which is sad, because the food was descent.  You would think that a re-opening of the place the manager would be out making sure every shift went awesome but there was no one to be seen.  I will say that the busser was more helpful than our server at times, but he was too young to bring us our beer.",

There were at least 4-5 servers and 2 bartenders outside.  Took 15 min. to get a drink.  Ordered food, 20 min later the appetizers arrive with ONE entree!  NO flatware, napkins, plates etc.....15 minutes later the server apologizes for the cook and offers half off the second entree, which STILL hadn't been brought out!.  Needless to say that entree was cancelled.  Food wise, I had the morrocan chicken which was ok.  The torpedoes were very good.  My thought is, if you open a new restaurant hire experienced servers.",

We were sat immediately and the waitress came to take our drink orders promptly, but that was the end of the promptness. Not very long after we were sat, a group of three was sat next to us. No one came to take their drink orders and then when our waitress came with our beers she just walked away. The group of three just up and left saying something to the hostess on the way out. Our waitress was nice although she wasn't very professional and seems like a newbie to the industry. She disappeared a lot, which limited me to only having two beers during the whole stay. Not sure if they were understaffed, but other tables with different waiter/waitress were complaining and the owner was picking up the slack. The owner was seen going up to tables and asking how things were but didn't bother to come up to us in the 2 hours we were there. I really want this place to work cause the building is nice and the food was pretty good other than the pulled pork being a tad bit dry. The draft prices were also a bit high, $6.50 for a pint. They either need a serious staff retrain, more staff, or new staff. I would definitely be back if these things were improved.",

I expected a little more than the ho-hum barely there remodel that obviously had zero thought put into it, I really didn't see \"The Cabin\" look they were going for. Let's move on to the food my wife had the grilled pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes which the chops were slightly overcooked but the potatoes were good. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw with a baked potato. I figure when eating at a bar stick to bar food. My sandwich was extremely dry and flavorless, shredded cardboard covered in bbq sauce would have tasted better! Thank god for the coleslaw and baked potato. We did have the stuffed jalapenos which were good but the limp bacon they were wrapped in seemed to be under cooked. All in all it sucked but I gave it two stars because the new waitress was attentive and  friendly; however I will try it out one more time but if I have the same experience I won't be back.",

We ordered a couple drinks and I ordered a beer off the menu that was hand written above the bar and they didn't have a few of the beers that were still listed so,i just asked what they had and got the first thing I recognized . After I finished my beer I ordered a mint julep. Now being at a whiskey bar I figured this wasn't going to be a problem. But the waitress came back and told me they couldn't do a mint julep. A little shocked but I just asked for a jack Daniels Lynchburg lemonade....she couldn't do that either. So apparently they didn't have jack Daniels lemonade and triple sec..asked her what whiskey coctails they had and apparently they only had one at the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.so&s=5f05056ab1512ac19f5b859ad629357f0072c757e4231230c941f0e6dbb12379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">time.so</a> I just ordered the same beer that I got because I knew they had it...ok so the food was good I ordered the parmesan encrusted chicken. Nothing I would say was amazing but I left full. Then we ordered desert and I wanted the brownie...but guess what they were out of that. The manager was great and bought us dessert.

My wife had the chicken parmigiana, which was a little unconventional. It was served more like a chicken & pasta bowl, but again, great flavor. We also had the Avacado egg rolls as an appetizer, they were amazing! The staff was friendly and on point. The manager even came out and talked with us, and she was super nice and accommodating. Our server was Makena, and she was great! Our drinks stayed full and we never felt neglected. I'm glad I gave this place a chance, despite some of the poor Yelp reviews.

I ordered the lemon chicken and he ordered the salmon both looked quite delicious.

My hair color is a very light brunette so there was no way it could've been mine especially besides my forearms never left the edge of the table. We called our server over to show the hair, she quickly whisked my plate away then returned to the table stating she had no idea how it could've gotten there as all the cooks had hairnets on.... hmmmmm. She did comp my meal, offer a new meal, a drink on the house but we politely declined the offer as my stomach had already turned at the thought of food. In all of this,management not once came by our table to check in with us. As we left we said good night to her but was quickly snubbed as she passed us.  All in all our previous experiences at The Cabin were good but this time is making us think twice of even coming back.",

I loved the inside decor with the woods and cabin feel. This place is in the old sand bar location with similar set up becoming a straight party bar at night. Once we sat down things didn't get better it took the waitress about 20 mins to find a drink menu because they ran out. At one point we were asked if it was okay if the big garage doors were opened it was a nice night so it was perfect with them open for about 2.5 seconds when the cigarette smoke from their patio bar started coming inside. When we said something to the waitress and this was a violation on the smoke free Arizona the solution was to shut the doors. Before leaving we had to go to the patio bar and once we got outside were absolutely disgusted by the amount of people smoking at vaping! There was even a group of young girls out there eating but not one staff member corrected the situation in fact one staff member walked out the door and vaped himself right next to them. I really wanted to be able to give more stars because the food was great and the live music was nice but we won't be coming back due to the disgusting smoking and lack of service. Think even 2 stars is being generous.",

Chips were hard but salty. And salsa waa super runny. No real chunkyness. Like tomato soup. It was ok flavor wise. Ordered the steak skewers for dinner. I ordered them medium cooked. They came out well done. Over cooked and very chewey. Not good when overcooked. But the flavor wasn't that bad. Came with a side of veggies and rice. Both were delicious. Would come again. I mean it is Bar food afterall.  Cabin cabin don't let me down  I wanna come back so you change my frown.  I'll order it right.... So You'll make it good.. Just like I knew you could.  One more try to test your skills I'll be there for cold beer refills",

Rice had good flavor but had dried pieces that we're crunchy.  The vegetables were very good.  The best part of our experience was our server, Cisco.  He was very friendly, accommodating, and informative.  Because of Cisco, we will be back.",

Would pry come back for a happy hour if it was worth it (don't know their specials).  The only negative I found is:  Chips & salsa is $6 (it is \"unlimited\").  Not worth it & didn't realize there was a charge the way it was presented by the waitress. She said, \"we have unlimited chips & salsa..... blah blah blah about other food.. do you want some chips and salsa?\"  Obviously if you frequent restaurants, you know chips & salsa are usually free and \"unlimited\" .... but not here. Don't get confused and don't bother with it because it doesn't even seem like in house cooked chips with authentic salsa.",

First off i don't think it was particularly one persons fault and our waitress was doing the best she could with what she had.   My opinion, way over priced for the quality of food. My street tacos were marginal. Decent presentation meat was tender but the taste of the meat was weird. Almost reminded me of a burnt taste mixed with the smell of every meat cooler I've ever been in.   Service was off the chain slow. The group was very very hunger and each persons meal came out in spurts. Leaving me to look at everyone's food in jealousy. My appetizer was like the fifth plate to be served... for real though why are people getting burgers and dinner salads before i even see the order of wings i placed?   My personal favorite was the blonde curly headed **** dude. He serves a plate of humus with peta bread... the pits bread drops on the floor while he is setting it down... i try and tell him he dropped the bread. He clearly has no interest in what I'm trying to tell him... my aunt asks for more pita bread and the dude says \"idk you have a waitress for that you have to ask her\". What a joke.   For sure not a place i will return to for a Sunday meal.",

I'm just now barley posting the review now that I'm back home to boring Bakerfield, CA, but I would like to give a shout out to the bartender Logan who was definitely one of the most friendly bartenders I met on our week vacation. We talked a for a little bit about beers and general life things. He's got a good head on his shoulders and is headed in the right direction. We sat out on the patio and initially took a while for service to get going, which led me to the inside bar where Logan was at, and he took care of me in a jiffy, even helping out to the table with my drink  The food was great, as well as the drinks, thanks again Logan for the amazing time. We will definitely be back to this spot the next time we visit Arizona",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this little gem a few weeks ago and have been by every weekend since!  I was a little concerned the first time we poked our heads in as there were several waitresses at the hostess station, dressed a little too \"Hooter-esque\" for me considering we had kiddos with us - I thought perhaps it wasn't family friendly.  However, we peeked at the menu and it sounded great, so we gave it a try.  The service was absolutely fantastic!  Each visit our waitress has been super attentive without being obtrusive and service has been fast and friendly.  Really nice job!  The feel is a little too woodsy for me on the inside (Camo fabric on booth seats, stuffed animals for decor).  It was awesome to be able to watch sports on their flatscreens though - and haven't hung out on the patio yet but now that the temp is finally coming down after a hot summer...can't wait to be out there.  The patio is big with misters humming along at full speed - super fun looking patio and should make for a wonderful place for a date or girls' night out this fall!  The food has always been fantastic - we have tried Avocado Egg Rolls (a must try if you like avocado - seriously amazing), Wings, a Tuna appetizer dish, and a few other things.  Our food has been out of this world good - the kind of food that will keep us coming back time after time after time. The kids meal has standard kid fare, but they do step it up a notch and I appreciate that!  No \"Easy Mac\" here - kids get the real thing with a delicious homemade mac and cheese.    This is becoming our family's go-to spot when we are out and about on a busy Saturday.  Well done, Cabin - very happy to have you in the West Valley!",

    "text": "Been to the cabin twice now and the first time I went my tab was $30.00 and when the tab cleared in my bank account they charged me $70. After reaching out to the restaurant twice and getting no call back and talking to the GM three different times to get them to check my credit card receipt. Finally after 2 weeks got a call back that they owed me $35 cause they over charged my account. Worst customer service ever and coming from someone who works in the industry as well is saying a lot because I know what it takes to be a bartender, waitress, and manager and they have horrible customer service! Honestly probably the worst I've seen!     I decided to give The Cabin a second shot and went and had brunch with a group of friends. We ordered and it took an hour for our food and appetizers to come out. They left our food in the window waiting to be served for so long that it become cold. So when we received our food it was all cold and waited an hour for. Then my friend found mold floating in her child's cup of apple juice!! Disgusting!! GM came over and all he said was, \" oh sorry, I just got here. I'm sorry.\" And then walked away and then never came back to check on us. When we were done we asked our waiter for the bill and he said it was taken care of but the GM never came back to our table to tell us himself!!  I was shocked to learn that this gentleman was not just a manager but the GM of The Cabin and obviously doesn't know what customer service means! Very disappointed in this restaurant was looking forward to a new restaurant in the area, only to be extremely disappointed and I will not be going back!!!     I would NOT recommend The Cabin at all!!!!",

When I asked to speak with the manager about it he totally avoided me.  He had two hours to finally come speak with me and he didn't bother to do so. Not the best first impression for sure.",

The waitress was still learning the menu and deals because she had to go double check before answering some of our questions.    I don't know how to explain it but the ambience of this place is off.  Maybe because it's still new and trying to figure things out.  The place is huge.  Almost two huge.  It doesn't have a cozy cabin feel.  They need to fix that.    Random but two of the restrooms were out of toilet seat liners and it was only 630pm.  So gross!  The appetizers were tasty but I just wasn't really impressed.  I will try it again in a few months after they work out the kinks of being a new restaurant.",

We went bar hopping after a suns game in downtown Phoenix then decided to stop here on the way home to check this place out. The place was rather empty. We were turned down at the door because one of my cousins was casually dressed for the game. He wasn't planning on bar hopping but still he looked way more presentable then the sloppy looking, unprofessional guy at the door and we had absolutely no problems at other bars we went to. I will never step foot in this place again. It ruined my last night out with my cousins in town for absolutely no good reason. I know now why their parking lot was so empty at 1 am on a Friday night and I am looking forward for this place to shut down.",

As I came here for lunch today, my husband and I were the only people at a table and there were 5 people at the bar.  That's it!  Our server brought drink, ordered our food after 10-15 min wait, and then sat and ate his lunch.  We could see him eating from our table.  We needed refills, asked another server (ad we could see out server was at \"lunch\")...she so graciously went over and told him.  Her continued to eat, we continued to be thirsty.  Manager was talking at the bar, or who I guess was manager paid no attention to any other customers.  Finally our server finished his lunch, then miraculously our food was ready.  I got patty melt-- soggy bread & cold fries.  Husband got nachos, usually very good.  Today not so much.  Asked for extra cheese and told there was on there, there was a quarter of normal cheese and I was hanged for extra.    We continued to wait and wait, no one ever checked on us. Also on top of this is. Was 115 outside and I think 110 in the restaurant....so hot and uncomfortable.    I think this was the straw, not sure I'll be back anymore...",

    "text": "The Cabin Whiskey & Grill is a casual restaurant in Peoria. They offer a WIDE variety of mostly American Comfort Food some with International twists. The atmosphere is rustic with lots of worn looking wood, trophies (dead animals) and camouflaged covered cushions. I warn you that it is also very loud in there with what some people might consider party music. They offer a very large bar with lots of seating, table seating, comfortable booths and outdoor seating.  We shared a Fried Macaroni 'N' Cheese Appetizer. We received five large pieces with a house made BBQ Ranch Dipping Sauce. I do have to give them credit....This is the best Fried Macaroni and Cheese appetizer I ever tried anywhere because the Texture was absolutely perfect. Nice thin crisp crunchy coating that seemed oil free and creamy Mac 'n' Cheese inside. The only problem was the lack of seasoning.....I never salt food out...often things are too salty for me so when I salt something it really needs it......Also when I bit into some parts I only got white sauce and no cheese........maybe this was just an off batch...  For my meal I tried the Korean Street Tacos. The flat iron steak was nice and tender but lacked Flavors of Korean Marinade. They were topped with a lime forward slaw that lacked cilantro. When I applied the Hot Chile sauce the single shelled tacos dissolved...... :(   My husband had the Buffalo Breaded Chicken Sandwich. It was cute and the bun was branded with a \"C\" for Cabin. Like the Mac 'N' Cheese Balls this chicken was breaded and fried masterfully. It didn't even seem fried but was juicy and coated in a tangy hot buffalo sauce. Fries were coated, seasoned and hot and crisp.  It really wouldn't take much at all for the food to be 4 stars to me. Whoever was cooking has really great frying skills...For me it was just a few little things that make a difference.   Lack of seasoning in the Macaroni and Cheese Balls..maybe adding parmesan would help with the lack of salt and flavor.  For the Korean Street Tacos a marinade that includes soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, sesame and hot pepper would add lots of flavor to the beef and double shelling the tacos might help so they don't crumble and fall apart.  3.5 just like the Yelp average",

Would have been nice to sit on the patio but I thought it would be too hot, although it actually didn't seem that bad with the misters... maybe next time. Tried the southern style potato skins, which was really more like a single baked potato cut in half. For $10. That's a crazy markup! The brisket chili seemed to be lacking. But it was still tasty. Got the beef skewers with rice and onion rings. They were yummy! The meat was well done yet still tender and moist. Mmmm. The rice was okay, nothing special. The onion rings were cold. Even with my gift card this was not a cheap meal. I'd definitely say it's overpriced for what you get, but I would probably come back for the patio experience.",

Not horrible that they did, but the environment of the restaurant would make you think food would be served in real dishes. Bus boy came by and and asked if we were done with chips and took away the basket instead of asking if we would like more. Our table ordered a steak and tacos. Steak was cooked as ordered, tasted good. Broccoli was cooked perfect. The carne Asada tacos came out cold, rice was cold, beans looked not so great but tasted ok. They did take them back and bring out new ones that were warmer pretty quickly. Light above booth was putting off some major heat making it warm where we sat. Menu had a lot of items on it, which is what made me weary of the food. Usually bars that want to also be known for food will keep the number of items on  the menu to a minimum and focus on making really good food. Also makes it easier on the kitchen staff. Noise level was pretty high. We were there on a Saturday at 7pm.",

They were very understanding very very accommodating and we truly appreciated that. We ordered appetizers and salads as our food selection. Everything was great.. Our Guest kept on saying how good everything was. they took care of our people very professionally and kindly. I have been boasting about the cabin ever since we went there.

Flavorless and it fell apart. I gave 3 stars because the bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. You can see all the puke on the walls and stalls that were not even attempted to be cleaned off. The bathroom door doesn't even close fully leaving peeking eyes into the bathroom. The sinks don't work. I would have rather used a port-o-potty instead. Just nasty!",

The 32 oz. beer mug for $7 is a nice HH deal. This lodge-like woodsy place could be a pleasant escape here in AZ, but it needs a good deep cleaning. The taxidermied creatures are so dusty and the bear had hunks of fur at its feet. The menu was torn and stained. They don't let you use Groupon during HH so will upcharge you to the regular prices so in our case we wound up paying $2 more than HH prices would have been without Groupon. That's a bad policy. The next day a friend said when he went there during HH with a Groupon, his server advised him to save the Groupon since he'd make out better if he just paid the HH price; wish our server would've been as thoughtful, but really it's the restaurant's fault since they are more concerned with making a short term profit instead of wooing a possible regular customer.",

We were told by the hostess we could sit where we liked, so we sat down facing the tv's as there was a baseball game on.

NOT ONE PERSON acknowledged we were in the building...and when we got up and left, the hostess, who had to know we weren't there long, said GOODBYE, I hope you come back soon.

Anyone who has trained military or police force knows how lethal pepper spray can have side effects that can last for 3days theres no excuse for whipping your guns out!!  Keep in mind about the past incident with surprise police killed that man and shot him repeatedly multiple times excessively!!!! More than they fuckin have to! This extreme force has to stop its unnecessary! The family is even suing the cops that killed that kid about the surprise incident because it was so excessive! Seriously get it together dude! And anyways Same fuckin bar (cabin) that will let women walk into men's restroom thinking its cute but yet a man walks in a women's restroom hes fuckin animal and lets throw him the fuck out!?

I don't mind paying those prices if the food is delicious.  I can say the reason you got any stars at all was because the waitress and guy who brought out our food were both on point and friendly. We also had a mixup on our tab, which management corrected. Atmosphere was fantastic and loved the Cabin look. We'd love to come back and give you another shot should we be able to have better quality food.  Seriously though, that OIL needs changed BADLY.",

Fortunately they fired his ass and replaced him with some cool people. Everytime im in there now i see the managers always make it a point to always say \"hi\" and see how everything is going. As far as their happy hour, check it out for yourself. One of the few places that actually discount everyone of their appitizers. I realize a review is just words, but i totally encourage you to stop in and form your own opinion. I think you will be totally surprised",

My spousal equivalent and I needed a bite and a few drinks around 9pm on Monday night. I knew it was later and a Monday so I called them to make sure they were still serving food, the woman on the phone said the kitchen would be open until 10pm. We were glad bc we only live 7 minutes away. We arrived at 9:17 and waited for about 4 minutes at the hostess stand while the bartenders just stared at us. Finally two bussers came up and just looked at us... I guess it's the patrons responsibility to speak first on Mondays after 9pm? Anyways, they asked if they could help us and I probs looked hella annoyed and was like, \"Yeah. We want to eat.\" (Duh). One of them said, \"Oh the kitchens closed.\"  I said, \"Hmm that's funny bc I literally called 10 min ago and the girl I spoke to said the kitchen would be open until 10.\" They both looked fakely shocked and said sorry. It was a disingenuous apology, whatever. They're lucky to get 3 stars from me. I'll most likely go back but I hope a manager or better yet, the owner reads this review... needless to say we ended up at Fleming's, which is never a bad place to end up.",

We had the torpedos , the avocado egg rolls and the calamari and thoroughly enjoyed them them all.  This was then followed by entres off of the eclectic menu including the black bean burger, the Cajun pasta and the flat iron and we all were very satisfied.  We met the manager Richard who went out of his way to impress and assist us in finding the best scotch.  We were amazed by AJ, the live music and our waitress also McKenna was very attentive.

Before I review the food, let me start with our waitress Victoria. I've eaten at a few greasy spoons and dined at some of the best restaurants in San Francisco and New York City. Victoria puts them all to shame, she is by far the best waitress we've ever had. It was our first time there, she was very knowledgeable and patiently answered all our questions about the menu, constantly refilled drinks and super friendly. My wife's uncle and I ordered the cheese burger topped with smoked pork, they were cooked to perfection. The ladies had chicken salads, they were huge & delicious. We had ice tea and commented to each other how good it was. The only negative was we were seated in a booth next to the entrance and can smell smoke from someone smoking outside. We will definitely make The Cabin a regular spot.",

I ordered a water with my drink and was told by the waitress that she would try but they were out of glasses at the bar. I said ok, didn't think much about it but did receive a water later on. Food was served pretty quickly and was ok, typical bar/restaurant food. However when my salad came out and I asked for silverware I was told that they would try and was told they were out of silverware. I couldn't quite figure out how I would eat my salad without a fork. We did have to ask twice for silverware. After our meal was served and finally given silverware our waitress totally disappeared for a half hour, never checking back in or someone else checking in. In looking around the restaurant/bar there were several empty tables. I would expect this kind of service in a busy restaurant. After finally receiving our check we paid and quickly left. I will not be going back there anytime soon. I hope they resolve their lack of silverware and cup issues.",

It was just starting to get busy, but after about 30 minutes with no service, I went to the bar for a drink.  After waiting about 10 minutes more, I finally got to pay excessively high cost for a drink in a plastic cup. The pour was fine, but the ice melted quickly causing it to taste bad after a few minutes. Finally returned to my group who complained to a manager about no service. They sent a brand new server with no idea of anything menu wise. She told us we couldn't do food because she didn't know how to order it. It took almost an hour to get our drink order, and despite our request to leave things open tab, she came back with all of our checks closed out, incorrectly. I was charged for another tables drinks, and she couldn't fix it. I asked for a manager, one never came. It has a cool theme, and is a party, but horrible service and bad staff ruined the nighy",

The lemon overpowered the chicken and the sauce which was poured over everything on the plate was so salty I couldn't eat more than a few bites. My husband had the grilled iron steak and his meal was also too salty to eat. On the other end of the spectrum my son ordered a turkey burger that had no taste whatsoever. The service wasn't much better. The server brought the salad but no silverware we had to 5-10 minutes before I could wave her down to get silverware. Everyone but my husband got their meals, his came later.  When the server came to check on our meals I told her it was terrible and I couldn't eat it. She did offer to get the manager but I didn't want another meal so I said no. The rest of the family finished what they could eat but our server was nowhere near us. She finally showed up with the bill and then we waited and waited and still nowhere near us. I had to wave down another server to take my cc. Again we waited for the server to return. Terrible food and poor service and to make it even worse the place was not that busy.",

    "text": "After driving by this restaurant numerous times and admiring their really nice looking patio we finally decided to give it a try. We chose a warmer evening with a beautiful sunset.  But upon walking up we discovered the chairs (stools only) on the patio were hard metal and all high tops.  Having children with us and a couple who suffer chronic pain we unfortunately opted to sit inside.  This alone was a pretty big disappointment.  The patio was basically empty and would have made for a perfect setting for us but the stools were a huge deterrent. So we sat inside.  The ambiance was fun and different.  Being originally from Montana where cabins abound made me chuckle at the fact they turned a cabin into a bar/party place.  But it's a cute idea. The food was decent.  2 in our party ordered burgers and unfortunately both thought they were pretty tasteless.  Large, but tasteless.  I ordered a salad which was huge and really good.  The fettuccine Alfredo and fish and chips were also hits.  We started with chips and salsa and their salsa was good as well. The service was interesting.  I won't say it was bad but it was pretty disorganized.  Our server was acting strange all night, almost like she kept getting confused and/or didn't know what she was doing.  She kept forgetting things and when we reminded her she acted very troubled.  Super weird.  She was pretty forgetful, even giving us the wrong check and when we paid we put 2 credit cards in to pay but she charged it all on 1.  Just a series of kind of strange things with her.  But the manager came over to check on us and he was super friendly. I think I might come back and try again but I am not going to lie, the patio seating kind of turned me off.",

Noticed that they had Blue Moon battered cod on the menu.   Ordered a Blue Moon to drink -- they didn't serve Blue Moon...huh?  Wife ordered iced tea...they ran out of regular iced tea.  Ummm... there's a Safeway right down the road.  Want the recipe for iced tea? Ordered salad for before meal.  Didn't come until after dinner and after we asked for it.  however, we were charged twice for it. Got the Cabin Burger medium-rare -- one of their half-pound burgers.  Good char on the outside, right temperature, but lacked seasoning.  When a restaurant creates these BIG burgers you've got to season the meat so the customer doesn't have to disassemble them. Onion rings were soggy, but French fries were good.   Asked the waitress -- of Cabin Whiskey and Grill -  how much a shot of Jack Daniels cost (one of the more popular blue-collar bourbons).  She said $4.50 or $6.  I asked which it was, but she didn't know, so she checked.  It is $6.50.    A change in leadership or leadership style might be needed to help this restaurant survive.  They are quickly becoming the next Toby Keith's bar and grill.  I don't think they'll survive another year.  I know I won't be contributing any more money toward their survival.",

It was real mac n cheese, not instant Kraft.... And the other kids meal was well made as well.  Not a fan of the chips and salsa but everything else we had was really good.  Raising up to four stars.   **********  First thing noticed was how dirty it was all over the parking lot from the late nite activities from the day before.  Give a guy a blower or a broom for goodness sake.   Really had high expectations based on menu descriptions.  Unfortunately the execution of the menu was sub par.  Said poke and got seared ahi ... Ugh.  Really???   Wings were alright. ... But still not matching what the menu describes.   Cool decor, cool menu... Too bad it fell apart after that.  Not being nit picky.... Just know what I read and what I expected.    It's the old Sandbar I think... I'm sure another place will rotate thru this spot,  just like they all do in this shopping center.",

The small table they put us at was kind of cramped, but it was ok. We started with the chips and salsa which seemed like store-bought chips even though the menu stated that they are homemade (which is why we got them). Maybe they are, but at least serve them warm if you're going to call them homemade! The salsa was better than the chips. I got the chicken poblano. I expected chicken breasts covered in sauce but it was all chopped up together. It was ok, but I only ate the chicken, the rest was a little too spicy for me. The side dish was fried masa? It's a good start but lacked flavor. My husband got the walnut chicken salad sandwich. It's huge! He said the chicken salad was good but strangely lacking in walnuts for a dish with \"walnut\" as the first word. The bread looked like one step above Roman Meal bread (very plain). The sweet potato fries were fine. Nothing special but nothing wrong with them either. I had a beer that was really good, it was an orange vanilla beer. Overall, we won't go back. Didn't like the atmosphere and the food was mediocre.",

The employees are constantly having conversations with each other in groups, and they are not quiet about their inappropriate work conversations. Both steaks were undercooked to top it off. This place is mediocre at best and feels more like a frat house or sorority house than a restaurant.   Skip it and go somewhere else. Anywhere else.",

Later at night it cracks off as expected with a more lively crowd outdoors mostly...but usually in a positive manner...great place to take a date.

This is the one place that made me feel extremely old and for it to actually be inappropriate for me to be in a bar at my age lol. I haven't even hit the  30  Yet..  This place is FILLED with a bunch of 21 year olds which is an obvious as soon as you get passed the bouncer. I'm not judging 21 year olds but I'm judging some of their behaviors (ha makes me sound old).   Anyway as far as the place as a whole it isn't bad and their happy hour is great. Passed 9 or 10 it's $3 drinks, this was a Friday so I don't know if they do that on weekends also. The bartenders are super cool and attentive and give more than they should. In the bathrooms like most clubs they have a person who tries to hand you paper towels or hair ties (really anything so you can tip them). I am not sure about the dress code either because there were alot of people wearing baseball hats and sneakers/t-shirts. Didn't try the food so I don't know about that. It was fun but won't be back.

    "text": "After eating here recently, either the cook pulled a no-show or they paid a kid to cook customers food. Never seen a worse version of macaroni and cheese as this chef decides to melt a slice of cheese out of a package on top of some flavorless pasta and cheese sauce with bacon. The dish was below the Kraft out of the box level and should not even be on the menu without a complete recipe overall.      Baby Back ribs also seem to have come from a bad pig. These were were like pork ribs, but they had tons of fat on them in-between some meat. They fell of the bone, but I wish they had fallen on the floor instead, so I would not have had stomach cramps the next day. The mashed potatoes somehow were grainy and unedible and possibly powdered. The only dish that did not get full hatred was the fish tacos, but those three tacos were of the 3 for $6 variety, not the 3 for $14 version we paid for.    Other issues were the lack of air conditioning and a miserable appetizer. BTW, every appetizer is about 10 bucks which is just a few bucks off from the price of an entree. Our bacon-wrapped jalapeno that was stuffed with cream cheese was rendered mostly untouched due to Kid Boyardee leaving the seeds inside the jalapeno making this pepper way too hot for even people who enjoy spicy food. There was also no brisket stuffed inside the pepper as promised.         Cabin is veteran owned, but they need a veteran cook and scribbling out items that are not available on the menu is quite amateurish.",

When I asked to speak to a manager she said \"is it about a reservation?\" I said no it's for a job inquiry... she said \"oh let me see if I can hand the phone over to my manager\" then hung up on me. Very rude and unprofessional. Seems like a cool place and the few times I've ate here it was enjoyable but sounds like they need better employees.",

We sat inside, next to some roll up windows which I'm assuming roll up during the late night hours. Our waitress was super nice and helpful and helped us pick out some meals she recommended. We felt super welcome and got our food right away. My mom got the app chicken wings buffalo style. The chicken wings had a cajun-early flavor or an after bite taste, super meaty as well. My mom got a side of French fries which let me just say they were amazing!! We've never had french fries like this before, super soft inside yet crispy on the outside. I got the sundried tomato walnut pesto pasta. It's a reddish sauce with fettuccine noodles. It came with onions, zucchini, blackened chicken pieces, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and broccoli. Super flavorful and would get it again! All in all I would come again for food and will have to try it for a late night bar experience!",

    "text": "Unfortunately a few of the bouncers/cocktail waitress at this place don't know how to give proper customer service. I was kicked out last night because 1. I stood on the bottom ledge of the chair for 30 seconds looking for a friend on the other side of the bar (he asked me once before to not do that and I admit I did do it again 2 minutes later he then said if you do it again you're out to which I replied I'm really sorry man I'm just looking for someone won't happen again) so at that point I was on their \"radar\" 2. Girl walking around with random juice shots asks me if I want one to which I replied \"no I'm good that's stuff is just juice and sugar\" (jokingly) she did not like that reply so she said something sarcastic and walked away. About an hour later she walks by again and I jokingly said \"me me me\" she rolls her eyes and says \"yea sure you do\" to which I reply \" I'm just kidding come on girl don't lie you know that's just sugar and juice\" (once again in a joking tone just to have conversation) her response was \"you're really annoying\" so at this point I realize she's obviously just having a rough night and uninterested in me joking around with her so I just say \"thanks I'll work on that\" and she walked away. 2 minutes later I'm getting kicked out because to the bouncer \"i keep causing problems\" keep in mind I'm in the industry and only had 2 drinks at this time. I treated the bouncers, my personal server, and patrons around me with nothing but respect yet for those 2 very minor issues he kicked me out. I calmly explained my side of the story to the main bouncer (no slurring, respectful, didn't curse) and he didn't care at all they made their mind up before I could say my side. Being in the industry and never being kicked out of a place I found it very upsetting to be treated like that. Some of the staff did a great job and I don't want to bad mouth everyone but a select few really give terrible customer service at this place and some of their bouncers act like they are watching over a prison and not a public bar where people go to socialize and have a good time. I get trusting and listening to your staff but to kick someone out for that is absolutely insane!",

The kitchen gave me fries instead, but when I told our waiter, she immediately got a HUGE plate on the side that my boyfriend and I ended up sharing.  He's a meat eater and got some kind shrimp pasta and loved it! The portion was huge so he ended up taking some home for the next day's lunch and loved it even more a second time!

Strangely there are 4 girls sitting at the hostess area doing mostly nothing while the wait staff is busy waiting on customers. As a group, they clearly did not like having their conversation interrupted by paying customers. Once we were seated, the waiter was efficient and attentive. I have no complaints. The food was a little strange the avocado egg rolls that people rave about; I am not a fan. The middle of the thing is tasty but there is just too much avocado and egg roll skin...very very rich. However the Korean Street Tacos were delicious, chips and salsa were good and The BLT is phenomenal. We will go back and try more of the food and I'm curious to find out if their rudeness at the front door continues.",

The crab cake appetizers had no crab , all bread and some flavoring. My $24 T-bone steak was cooked correctly but tough and numerous bites were mostly fat and Gristle.  The garlic butter on the steak was however amazing.  As my side, I ordered the sweet potato fries. When they arrived they were covered in sugar and cinnamon. Being diabetic I cannot eat Sugar. I asked for a replacement side since the menu showed no indication of the sugar. I ordered and received a side salad. During the meal the owner came by and asked how everything was I asked him if he wanted me to tell him the truth you said yes. I explained the numerous problems that we had and he indicated that he would take the cost of the crab cakes off the bill. He apologized for the problems with the meal and said he really wanted to take care of it. He sent over plain sweet potatoes fries , which i did not order and charged me $1.  When the check arrived not only did he not take the cost of the crab cakes off but I was charged $4 for the side salad.  We did receive cards for 2 fee appetizers and took 20% of the cost of my steak (not the bill) but we won't be returning.",

I had been here when it was the Sandbar for drinks a few times, and the remodel the new owners did is just bad. It almost feels like this restaurant is confused at what it is. Tacky decorer (bad camo covered seats and weird pictures randomly placed, with the most uncomfortable looking bar stools), the waitresses dress in hooter like clothing (just all black), reggae music was playing the whole time, but the menu is more upscale food and extremely high priced. The pictures that people have posted will give you a clue.  We had no real issues with service, but it was slow. They also did not inform us before hand that a salad as a side, instead of fries, was a dollar extra (not the biggest deal, but would have been nice to know). We spent the whole time eating talking about the ambiance of this place, it honestly was just that weird. We finally decided it was like eating in a forgotten part of Cabellas where redneck college boys would probably hang out.  We honestly liked the food. We had an interesting appetizer of a new take on poppers, a couple of burgers and the cookie for dessert. But if youre going to charge 9 dollars for 4 poppers, and 13.50 for a burger, then it better be a great experience. It just wasnt. I also would not bring my young kids here, even for lunch. I did not find it family friendly with the decore, music and how expensensive the food was.  We did not have any drinks so I cannot speak to the service, price or quality of their alcohol.",

This is a child friendly place, even Friday and Saturday nights, before 10pm.   They have very fresh food and fantastic service! I had the shrimp and chicken pasta today and the shrimp was fantastic along with the rest of the dish. Sometimes with Shrimp dishes the shrimp tastes day old, you know what I mean, and these did not. The food was very good and I will be back for sure!",

I haven't had this much fun in a long time. The tables were plenty far apart so we felt like we could laugh and talk without being obnoxious to others.  The wait staff was amazing. Shiva was out waitress, and she was great.  Mark, one of the managers  came over to say hi and was very friendly.  The table was cleared often as we tried several drinks.  The Whisky #4 was the favorite,  and if I could give any criticism it would be the drinks tasted a little different each time.   The appetizers were great, and everyone loved their meal.  It is a no brainier that we will be coming back.  And with Happy Hour M-F 4-7 makes it extra worth it!",

People on budgets like to have a nice night out too. Not all of us have bottomless pockets. Prices help. Should hire girls for knowledge and a little less for tit. I want this place to succeed cause I love whisky. Yet I see house drinks tailored for semi educated and low tolerant tastes. Have to say though, the food comes out quick and hot and delicious. Given em 2 stars. Owners, I hope you're paying attention to this and the other establishments in the area and general age group and income. Do NOT become another whisky rose and lose your identity.",

What I will say though is the DJ that I have seen there both times I've gone is SUPER RUDE. This guy looked angry as well when I was first there and that already started to kill my vibe. So not very surprisingly, once I interacted with him for the first time to request a song, he had a very harsh and rude response. That's a no-go for a bar/club business. This person is pretty much the tone setter for the whole place. There's plenty experienced and motivated DJs out there so this one should be FIRED immediately.",

We arrived about 7 p.m. and were promptly greeted and seated at a table of our choice. We again ordered the Torpedoes appetizer to start and it was done perfectly with crisp bacon on the outside and the brisket was flavorful.  For dinner we ordered a half rack of the barbecued ribs and the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was delicious and the server had recommended that we choose an unofficial option of having the sauce contain a more spicy version. It was very good. No shenanigans with the tables this time and a very good time. They have evidently gotten past their grand opening issues and IMO are an excellent dining choice now.",

It is bacon wrapped jalapeno with pepper jack cream cheese and chunks of tender beef brisket. They are very tasty and a little pricy for $9 for 5 poppers. Our server Cassidy was very nice and helpful to us and even kept finding us after we moved about the bar. We paid around $93 for all our drinks and appetizer.

The Good: they have some delicious things on their menu and the food was consistently good. The whiskey selection was great. They have some good specially cocktails. The outdoor area is awesome and the indoor decor is fun. It is very clean.   The Bad:  The service. Consistently. As a disclaimer, we always sat at the bars (both indoor and out) so I can't speak for service in the dining room. They generally have more than one bar tender working, but it is still a long wait for drinks and service. They are often too busy talking with one another and other staff.  It's not even other customers they are talking too. This is a regular issue. Also, the prices are high. There are other equally nice places where you can spend $15-30 less on drinks and appetizers for two and still have a good time and better service.",

Of course i started asking him questions as to why he was doing this and all he could say is he does this randomly to double check. First of all do you not trust your employees to do their job. As a manager it's super important to have trust in your teammates so that bothered me. Second he said he did this to random people and i kept my eye on him and we were the only ones that he had to \"recheck\" our ID's.

Business was slow but staff was welcoming. We will go back and were very satisfied with the prompt service and good food!",

Lots of folks enjoying the Arizona weather outside.  They have heaters when the temps drop.     We were there for an early dinner.   Great Happy Hour prices 1/2 price apps, 3:00 well drinks and lots of wine and beer specials.    We tried the macadamia/coconut chicken skewers.  I would defiantly get them again very good, loved the sauce.    Dinner I selected the Patty melt it was awesome, they use Parmesan cheese bread.  Friend  had their chicken salad sandwich with curry and cranberry's.  They enjoyed it, it was quite large.    They have about 8-9 side items to choose all looked great.    Their menu has something for everyone including the kiddos. Great variety, all looked delish.   Staff is welcoming with smiles, always a god sign to me.    We will be back for HH and dinner in the near future.",

    "text": "This was our first time visiting Cabin Whiskey Grill. We arrived just before 5pm on a Saturday. A hostess seated us, and that's when there were some missteps. We weren't supplied a drink menu or any utensils, and then had to wait about 10 minutes to meet our server. I asked for the additional menu, and my husband eventually had to grab utensil bundles from the hostess stand. Once we met our server, though, our food was brought out at a good pace and she checked on us often.  We were seated at a table indoors but right at the edge by the patio. It was a lovely evening. The atmosphere was quite nice. Unlike some places, it was not horribly loud, even though we were between the patio and the bar.  The kitchen here is fantastic. We ordered the Famous Cabin Torpedoes for an appetizer: jalapenoes stuffed with pepperjack cheese and brisket, then wrapped in bacon. These were REALLY good. I can't do really spicy food, but I could do these! They had flavor, not scorching heat.  My husband had a ribeye and fries. He was impressed with how they cooked the ribeye--and he's picky about that.  I had a margarita (okay, nothing extraordinary) and Korean tacos. Again, I was impressed. Some restaurants use leftover meat for things like tacos. That was not the case here. The pan-seared steak was incredibly fresh and tender. I tried a dab of the accompanying sauce and found it waaaaaay too spicy, so I was a little worried that the tacos might be dry. Nope. The meat along with the slaw topping and some ginger was just perfect. Better than expected.  Our son had the kid entree with macaroni and fries, and he enjoyed it all. I had a bite of the macaroni and cheese, and thought it was good. We were supplied a container to take the last portion home.  Even though we kind of had to fend for ourselves at the start, the cook left us quite impressed. We'd go back for sure.",

We got a nice big booth and were greeted by our waiter right away. The inside of this place has a great ambiance to it and was much larger than I had expected.   I ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a bloody mary. It was brought out quickly which I always appreciate. The menu is pretty good, they seem to have a decent variety but I would like to see a little more options. Some of the items seemed to be repeated on each page (ie. chicken skewers, beef skewers, shrimp skewers). I ordered the shrimp tacos and my husband got the BLT.  The BLT came and it was ginormous with loads of bacon. I was a bit jealous. The shrimp tacos looked pretty lonely on the plate as this is all you got was the 3 tacos. My husband said the BLT was great, I had a piece of bacon and can confirm. My tacos were pretty good. The fish was nice and flaky, the batter was nicely done, and the sauce was delicious and had a little kick to it. I would have liked to see a little more ingredients on the tacos and perhaps some sort of side but then they were good enough that I would order again.  I will be back. Definitely would like to try out some of the other menu options they have and would love to get out to the patio.",

The Cabin Torpedoes and Avocado egg rolls are both amazing. Have to say, not a bad thing on the menu.     The outside bar is also fantastic. Beer pong, corn hole, TVs and misters.

We went last night (Wednesday) just before 7pm and it pretty busy.  The wait for a table was short but after being seated for 15 min we still hadn't been acknowledged by a server. As we were walking out the door the owner Payton came after us,  apologized for the wait and said he would take care of us.  We agreed to give it one more try.  A water came right away with some water and took our drink order.    They didn't have a drink menu so I told him I wanted something fruity with vodka and to surprise me.  He brought me an \"around the world\" which is one of the best drinks I've ever had. I give the Cabin 2 stars for that drink alone! We asked the waiter to give us 5 min to decide on our order and during that time if he could find out what was in the drink.  15-20 min later he returned to take our order and had forgotten to find out what in the drink. I asked him to find out if the bartender knew how to make a \"June bug\". Our food came out and he not only finally told me what was in the drink but bought me another. Although I didn't order it I was happy to drink it but I never did get an answer about the June bug. The food was good and portions were nice. The vegetables were cooked perfectly,  tender with just a slight crunch. The beef and chicken skewers were tender and juicy with a delicious sauce on top. Brushetta was good but the bead could have been better. The house mac n cheese was really good. Start to finish we were there for a total of an hour and a half. I would go there again but I might have a snack before going and I definitely would make sure I wasn't on a time constraint.",

My husband and I came and brought our 7 year old, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a children's menu, with all the favorites kids could enjoy.   Let me tell you. The Cabin Mac n' Cheese was epic. Loaded with different cheeses and bacon! It was a perfect portion, and full of flavor. My husband had the BBQ burger and really enjoyed it as well.   We will for sure be returning. This place was good for dinner, and seems like it would be a lot of fun to enjoy during a girls night out. They appeared to have a full bar, and plenty of room for dancing also.   One of the ladies from the management team even came by to ask about our experience, and that goes a long way with me! Kudos to the staff here! Keep up the great service and you'll be spot on!",

The bartenders were moody and there were NO staff walking around to service anyone. The GM (or one of them) was busy playing beer pong. We had to ask to get in on a game. Unprofessional given your guests should be the priority.  This place seems like some guys long lost fantasy to own a bar. They named it the Cabin, threw up some logs and camo and it's supposed to be charming and rustic? Me thinks not!   This location used to be the Sandbar and when they were around it was always so busy and fun! Given that there isn't much on the west side I feel bad for the folks over there losing a place like Sandbar. Such a shame.  I would have to say the only plus about this place was the updated patio (no sand, no pool).",

No matter how much I bitched they wouldn't give it to me. the staff was complaining just as much and said it's one of their favorite. You should bring that back!  Now on to the good stuff. Service check. Quality check, flavor check. My wife got one of their specialty burgers and absolutely loved it.

I think they were reluctant to go out side- they're weren't many people outside other than our group. But, we would have ordered more drink no's and food if they would have been more actively serving our table. That being said the food and drinks that we had were good!

I don't think they expected so many people that early in the day. The manager did help out which was good.  We split the pulled pork sandwich and fries. It was all pretty good, plenty of meat plus a side of bbq sauce for dipping. The fries were seasoned just right with a slight crunch to them.  All and all a good time, once the other bartenders showed up which was at happy hour they were very attentive. Fair lunch hour prices. I just wish happy hour started sooner then 3:00 like noon or so.

You can see the layers of dust and food on them.  The ladies room was equally dirty if not more. The wall coverings are ripped off in some areas.  Do they have a company that they use to clean for them? If so, they need to get a different one in there asap.  I don't know who manages this place but whoever it is needs to be shown how an inviting place should look.  I shudder to think about the cleanliness of the kitchen!

Walked in today (Friday) at 1:30pm and there was no hostess at the front. The place was dead, so the lack of employee attentiveness was inexcusable. We stood at the front counter as you walk in for 8 minutes exactly (staring at menus), no one left and on one else came in. Two waitresses walked by without saying a single word and the bar tender looked over as well without signaling anyone to let them know we were there. So we turned around and left.  It's amazing how businesses like this manage to stay in business. It's also incredible to think of the amount of money they lost from a single customer who had the potential for going there twice a week on a regular basis.  Needless to say, the service there was pathetic. Rock Bottom up in P83 went out of business for this exact reason, wont be long for Cabin to follow in the same path if this continues.",

Finally we asked if we could still get an order to go off the happy hour menu at happy hour prices.  It ends at 7 p.m.  The time was 7:01 p.m. Waitress said she could do it.  Brought the order and then the check.  Check was full price for the happy hour price to go order. Bad.  We're done with this place and will simply spend our hard earned money elsewhere.

The bar really turns it up after 10 p.m. with a live DJ on the patio. Note to self & my fellow yelpers the patio bar is cleared of chairs & small side tables so, if you plan on sitting on the outdoor patio make sure you sit at a table above the bar vs the bar area. We tried 2 apps, the crab cakes & buffalo shrimp. Both were pretty basic. Definitely not anything to write home about but they both cut the mustard for bar food. They were served hot & crunchy. The burgers looked really good just didn't make it to one of them. Maybe next time.",

I really think if the just have one of the bars open and allow dining to eat in piece. This place would be much better. Now to the food, I had the Monterrey Burger, Their burgers are large, I actually think the are to large. Seems the extra condiments and ingredients is the only thing I tasted. Burger really didn't have a lot of flavor, or maybe the extra things were just over powering the burger? Wife had the chicken and vegetables skewers. She really didn't like anything about it. I thought the chicken and vegi's were excellent. However, the rice was awful. They only have pepsi products, and plenty of booze. Glad we tried it, however with all the competition in the area. There is a lot better options.",

The waitstaff was courteous and always there when you need them. The atmosphere overall was on point being that the name of the place is called The Cabin. Felt like I was up north in a log cabin.  As for the food today, all of us ordered various appetizers and my favorite were \"The Torpedos\", bacon wrapped jalapenos! Who knew?! Anyways, everything was fantastic and I will definitely be coming back to this joint.",

Like other places Cabin had great HH prices with a long list of appetizers at half price and a variety of drinks also at this level. Believe me the size of each appetizer is large. Several of the diners/drinkers needed take away boxes  as they could not finish. The venue itself  is well laid out, with a large outdoor area that I imagine is loads of fun at night or when the temperatures are a bit lower.  Service was the only issue, but it turned out that the day we were there was the day they started a new computer based system in the entire restaurant. I am sure this was the basis for the  mix up in some orders and the time to process orders. Anyway, it was certainly tolerable and I am sure in a day or two all the kinks will be worked out and all employees will be happy with the new system. All in all a great place for HH gatherings.  I had a nice Chardonnay and a triple humus plate and the total tab was $8.25......cannot beat that.",

I got the marg and my boyfriend got his favorite space dust IPA. The marg was delicious! So we just had to get more after our first round. Everything was great until the bill came. We were charged $7 for each marg. When I asked why she said \"the deals are only at night\" even tho it was under the \"Friday\" special. Thursday and Saturday even had different specials from the day and the \"night\" prices but Friday was just a solid \"all day\" special. But when asked again why it was like this she said \"well if you would've asked me I could've told you it was only a night. My computer just rings in that way\" I was just very taken back by how RUDE the bartender was and how unclear this menu is for drinks. You should change your Friday margaritas a to only a special time like your Thursday and Saturday so people aren't surprised by their bill. Very pissed when leaving this place because of your BEYOND RUDE BARTENDER. BEEY UNPROFESSIONAL.",

We asked for a booth,but the  three small ones were taken,and we didnt want to sit at the bar,or sit on the high chairs,so they seated us at a very large booth,which had a very wobbly table that also spun.Eating at it was an adventure.Our server was acting strange from the beginning.I asked what kind of sodas they had,and she said \"HUH?\"So I said soft drinks,and she said \"Pepsi Products\".That didn't narrow it down much,so we both ordered ice tea,with my wife asking for no lemon or sugar,which the waitress misunderstood,telling her there was sugar on the table,and giving her lemon in her tea anyway.     The food was really good.We started with chips and salsa,which were decent,but not really warm.My wife had the chicken skewers,and I had the carne asada street tacos.Both were very good,if not really plentiful.     Our server brought us our food and brought us our check,period.We ran out of tea,and she never came back to check on us.I figured it was the old waitress thing of giving the tables ordering alcohol more attention,because the check is always bigger,but she was an equal opportunity neglect-er.Everyone was looking around for service,and this was during their slow period.      Other reviewers have mentioned the decor.I thought the rustic cabin theme was so over the top,including a large portrait of Abe Lincoln.I think it was supposed to be camp or ironic,but I just found it bizarre.        I wish I could have given the place 2 and a half stars,but three will do.Will I come back here?Not with BJ's and Cracker Barrel so close by with much better customer service and larger food portions.",

We love whiskey and the online menu looked good. We arrived at lunchtime and were one of five tables. We did not receive lunch or drink menus, just the standard full menu, despite multiple menus laid across the counter. The waitress came and asked for our drink order. When I asked her for a drink menu, she said there wasn't one, and handed me a piece of paper from her pocket with handwritten beers, then produced a bartender card that listed all their drinks and how to make them. How can you boast yourself a whiskey bar and have nothing for me to even see what types of alcohol you carry?? We ordered a few apps to split; all were sub par and tasted like they were pre packaged. Despite all the doors being closed, we were pestered by numerous flies the entire meal. $65 later we left completely unfulfilled and still hungry. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Nothing about it is remotely worth it",

The service was poor this time but it was the first time we experienced that. We waited over 30 minutes for drinks that we ordered before happy hour ended. We were charged regular price for the drinks and when we complained they fixed it but proceeded to add drinks that we didn't have (maybe to make up the difference?) We had to send the bill back twice to get it right. I wonder if it changed owners or something. They were asking for plates and menus because they were out of them but it wasn't even crowded. Overall a nice atmosphere and good food prices about the same as similar establishments.",

They have a massive selection of whiskey and another night I would have tried a few of them. The manager ended up comping my meal even though I insisted on paying for it. Looks as though he is trying to improve things and I hope it works out. I will give this place another try.",

    "text": "Went last night for the first and last time. We arrived about 6:00 PM. When we finally figured out where the hostess/host stand was we were greeted and able to sit by the \"garage doors\". It was raining but it was nice having the doors open. Given this was our first time there we took a little time to figure out what we would like. This seemed to upset the waitress as she gave unpleasant service to us the rest of the night. We had a couple of questions while placing our order and again this seemed to upset her and even appeared to be confused. We ordered the nachos for the appetizer, we requested that because of some food allergies that all toppings except for the cheese on the side. The appetizer arrived fairly quickly, but sour cream was not \"drizzled\", it smothered the entire too. We were able to eat around the sour cream and in the end we enjoyed them. I ordered the Cabin Cheeseburger and requested that all the \"condiments\" not only be on the burger but on the plate as well. I could immediately tell the waitress did not know what I was talking about, so I then requested that the cheeseburger come plain and to please not put anything like tomato, onion, lettuce even on the plate. Again when the food arrived, a simple request could not be filled. I was extremely disappointed with the cheeseburger. It looked like a pre-made frozen patty and had absolutely no flavor to it at all. The french fries were hot and a little on the crispy side which I enjoy. My partner got the turkey avocado sandwich with fries and he enjoyed it and said it was good. When our bill arrived we found out the appetizers were half off until 6:00, but no one told us, if we had know we would have gotten another one. Since we had a gift card and had unexpected money left over we ordered the apple pie. This was fantastic and worth the 15 minute wait. It is served hot out of the oven with a nice scoop of ice cream. Perfect dessert for two or three people to share. Back to the garage doors, as I said it was raining, but the rain was not coming into where we were seated. One of the owners comes over out of the blue and closes them. When we asked him why, he said I just figured people want them closed because of the rain. We had been there for at least 20 minutes at that point and it had been rain well over an hour at this point. He compromised and left one door slightly open. A few minutes later and someone else comes over and closes that one without asking anyone if they needed it closed. Just as we were finishing our meal, a second owner came over and said he was opening the doors if that was ok. He asked every table seated by the doors. When he came over to our table we explained to him that we asked to sit where we were because the doors were open and we didn't understand why they were closed in the first place. I gave a two start rating mostly because of the attitude of the waitress. Reviews on the food was mostly positive, but how can you screw up a cheeseburger?",

The owners, managers and staff are all very helpful and make it a point to make sure every guest has a great experience. The food comes out in a timely manner, great portion sizes and has yet to disappoint. My favorites thus far are the wings, cilantro lime shrimp and any of the tacos on taco Tuesday. The Cabin is also the place to be on the weekend nights. Great Djs, music and the bar tenders are quick in getting drinks out. I highly recommend The Cabin Whiskey and Grill to anyone and will continue to be a loyal customer.",

    "text": "Summary: In a plaza that has seen much better establishments fail, it is a cosmic injustice that a bar & grill like this can exist for so long.   As the rest of the far west continues to develop their own unique options, some argue Park(e) West is struggling to maintain relevancy. Establishments from several years ago have already packed their bags. And while it's fortunate other restaurateurs are attempting to upcycle these spaces into something more worthwhile, I'm afraid this could join the long list of failed projects.   Cabin used to be Sandbar. They kept the outdoor bar and the large patio, but traded the sand for more wooden fixtures. Beyond that, literally nothing else was invested in atmosphere.That's not something I'll get riled up over, but I just have to point out that not trying is really a reoccurring theme here.   The menu doesn't really excite me. They boast \"whiskey & grill\" in the name, but if it weren't for their website, I'd never known they had an expansive whiskey selection. There were no advertisements for it, and I hadn't seen it on a physical menu. In fact, options for their signature drinks or craft beer bottles were never visible to me. That is a problem.   As for food, the menu seems to be really big on a variety of tacos and steaks. I went with a classic pub favorite--the calamari. The familiar chili sauce it came with indicates the menu does borrow from its predecessor. But...this was the worst calamari I'd had--they looked and tasted like just plain fish sticks TBH. I couldn't even finish half, and after sampling it themselves, my friends were in no hurry to indulge either. Yikes! When incredibly simple dishes are terrible, what confidence can you have for the product of actual creativity in the kitchen?  There are plenty of decent dining options nearby, and I wasn't really going there for the food, so this isn't even what gets me the most. The service here is just absolutely flat out terrible. Despite having several tables reserved for about 20 people, any servers were done for the night well over an hour before the kitchen closed. This led to quite a few of us waiting around awkwardly and empty handed, never being asked so much as what we wanted to drink. I had to request a menu.  After spending a few more hours here between my visits, I see why it's all moving so slow. Despite dozens of customers, Cabin tries its hardest to rely on one bartender doing all the work. The barbacks don't ease the workload by handling the simple tasks, like fetching beers or cleaning up. So...what are they doing? They chill out and play beer pong with security and customers for most of their shift. I am not the first reviewer to notice this. And don't get me wrong, I appreciate a laid-back work environment, and I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but management at some point needs to understand that it can *not* come at the expense of the customer experience. Even worse, it looks terrible to have the women (which AFAIK all their bartenders are) busting their asses while the guys literally play around through their entire shift. Slobs.   In the end, the only bright spot here was the bartender during my first visit in early May. Despite being inundated with work, she was positive the entire time, looked like she cared, and wasn't being a jerk--all while having the misfortune of working on her birthday. She's too good for this place. I hope she reads this review, realizes this is a sinking ship, and gets out before it's too late.   I have absolutely no reason to return.",

    "text": "My wife and I choose this restaurant for two reasons. 1st for its approximate location to our home and 2nd because of its outside aesthetics. However, after dining here it will be very hard for us to ever go back. We were greated promptly and courteously by the hostess. Yet the hostess's clothing attire was not one you would expect to see in a restaurant. The pants she was wearing were ripped up street jeans which is not something you want to see or how a restaurant should set its first impressions to its customers. Next we ordered some chips and salsa. The chips were great however there was no salsa to the salsa it was more like spicy tomato water. After enjoying our salsa soup for a bit the waiter Elijah came over to take the rest of our order. I ordered the fish and chips and asked what the special sauce was on the fish. The waiter said he thinks it was just tartar sauce but, was not for sure. So, when I asked if it came on the fish or if it would be on the side he was unsure and had to go ask the kitchen. After returning from the kitchen we were informed it was just a fancy name for tartar sauce and it come on the side. Next my wife order the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and asked the waiter if the shrimp could be left out of the pasta because she was allergic. The waiter was again not sure if that was possible and proceeded a second time to the kitchen to ask. Shortly after ordering all of our food my wife got up to visit the bathroom and things weren't good in there either. There was fork inside the bathroom and the entire place smelt of raw sewage as if a drain was backed up. My visit to the bathroom was also eventful on this evening I found dirty toilet seat without the courtesy of any ass hat for the seats. Also, the paper towel roll that had paper in it but it was not working so I had to air dry my hands. As we ate our food we watched the bartender leave his post go and eat his lunch while he had customers at the bar. Also, our waiter was either too attentive or not attentive at all. My wife enjoyed her pasta, however it was very spicy and she had to stop eating and wait for the waiter to come and refill her water before she could continue eating. The fish had so much batter on it that it was not fully cooked. Now I would have addressed all of these issues with a manager at the restaurant but, one never came to the table also, the comment card given to us at our table only gave the customer two lines to write on. The restaurant made it abundantly clear they want yelp reviews because, there were signs everywhere saying check us out on yelp. I hope this review finds the right people in order to fix these significant problems, or the 20 people they had on Monday will be more frequent and they will be out of business, especially since there is significantly better competition around this restaurant serving similar food.",

We were here last night 4/19 at about 8:30pm with my husband, my dad and my dad's girlfriend.  The place was pretty much empty inside.  A handful of people out on the patio listening to a terrible band.  We started off with drinks, a small Coorslight, a large Coorslight, a Modelo and a Guiness Blonde.  The server came back about 5 minutes later to let us know they no longer had Modelo and wanted to make sure I knew the Guiness Blonde was in a bottle.  Dad switched to a Kiltlifter.  She brings our beer, and I end up with Guiness Foreign Exchange?!  It was actually pretty good, so I kept my mouth shut and didn't send it back.  I assumed they no longer had Guiness Blonde either as the Foreign Exchange is not on the menu so I figured it was probably a swap out.  I ordered Fish Tacos as did my dad's girlfriend, my dad ordered Cajun Pasta and my husband ordered a Meatball Sub with Fries.  The food was actually pretty good.  The Tacos are tiny \"street tacos\" but packed with flavor.  My husbands sub looked good, but he couldn't eat the bread because it was either stale or over baked.  It was so hard you couldn't even bite into it.  The meatballs were pretty good though so he just ate the meat.  The service was pretty sub par as well.  We saw our server when we ordered, and again when she brought the drinks.  Someone else brought our food, server showed up over half way through our food and asked if we needed boxes.  My dad asked for one and the check.  It took another 10 minutes for the box and check.   When we got our bill my husbands beer was $11.50, yet the menu said $4.00!!  I politely brought it to the servers attention and she said, \"Oh yeah, we used to do that all night but we don't anymore.  It stops at 7pm now.\"  Ohhhh, well that may have been nice to know when you took our drink order and saw us ordering off the menu that was displayed on the table!  If you advertise something you should honor it; or better yet, DON'T ADVERTISE IT!  This place is a hike for my husband and I to get to, because we live in the Desert Ridge area, I can say with confidence we most likely will not be returning.  There are a ton of restaurants to eat at and have a good time, don't waste your money here.",

We shared a chicken sandwich which was pretty good. The mac and cheese balls are really good too. Once we got the food order in, it arrived fairly quickly (they were not really busy). It was not a bad experience. They do play country music, but I won't hold that against them. ;-)  We tried a second time this weekend.  It was not a bad experience, and the food is good. We have only tried a few things on the menu, but what we have tried has been good (a though the fish tacos were a bit meh though).  Our server was super nice, but he disappeared for long periods of time.  We came for lunch around 1:30pm, and we were there well over 90 minutes.  That's a long time for lunch. This is the main reason I am giving them a 3 and not 4. I think if they can fix the service issues (the time, not the quality) this could become a regular stop for us, but for now, I'd avoid it if we are limited on time.",

There were probably 5 or 6 young workers there but none of them seemed to know what was going on and most were just chatting and hanging around. We moved twice because of a wobbly table and then gave up hope. It was just an odd experience- their beer menu on the tables doesn't match the changing beer selection. I get, beers come and go but even a daily print out on the tables would be helpful- especially when the waiter doesn't know what's on tap, either. Then we read something about a loaded Bloody Mary special they have but again- no where does it explain what the special is and the waiter had to ask a manager who gave us a half/weird answer about putting any of the appetizers with the bloody. What? Anyhoo. Got a burger. It was alright, but nothing I would be back for. They had the doors open, as it was a nice day, which I get... but there had to be about 10 huge flies that were relentless which made the experience even more frustrating. We almost left halfway through but stuck it out to give it a fair try but we def won't be back. I feel like this place has HUGE potential- it's set up and ambience is cool. But yea- sucky experience.",

WeReceived a game booklet when we walked through the gates, looking through the book I noticed that the cabin restaurant was one that was recommended ....you also got a discount on beer and appetizers half-price. So after the game we proceeded to go to this restaurant when we walked in we stood for about three -four minutes with no one greeting us or acknowledging that we were there waiting . A few minutes went by and two customers that we're leaving the restaurant said to us as they left that this happened to us also but it was worth the wait.!So we continued to wait probably no more than five minutes before finally someone came up to the counter and said they would be right with us. By this time I usually would have probably walked out of the restaurant but we stayed due to getting a discount and try and the new restaurant we've never been to before. It looked like the restaurant had very few customers and even less employees working finally we were escorted to a table... then my husband asked can we have a booth? The man that was seating us had to get someone to clean several tables before we could even be seated. we waited again for our waitress to come gave her our entire order because by this time we had no idea how long it would take for her to get back to get our food order. She brought the two appetizers that we ordered and the drinks. We had to ask for plates to be able to eat the appetizers on then when we opened our napkins we had nothing but a fork !!So now we're looking for our waitress or really just anybody walking by to get us the correct silverware. To ordering our food we had showed the waitress about the half-price appetizers that was advertised and also the discounted beer price she looked puzzled and saidI've never seen that before? We waited for catch-up we waited for more dressing for the salad and was never offered refills on our drinks. Finally my husband had the credit card out ready to pay but we had no waitress insight to give us our bill?? When we did ask another employee if she could get our waitress she she nodded yes and went to look for her I guess I have no idea where they went. The waitress finally showed up gave us our bill... we were charged full price for everything ! my husband brought it to her attention of the half price appetizers and the discount on the beer the  waitress then said let me go get my manager and disappeared again! Waitress finally came back with no manager to discount our bill what she had done was just gave us a discount of $25.95 she just took the appetizers off of our bill along with the alcohol? This is one restaurant we will not be going back to ever! We were sitting at table a-3 ,3/24 /2019 and our ticket number was 000061 ID number 0902072 the reason I'm putting this information in and not mentioning the servers name is I hope that management Will be able to either better staff their establishment or train the current employees that are there.",

When the drinks FINALLY showed up, he was very inattentive. One friend ordered and appetizer and it came out cold. Food took way too long to get to us and the food was decent at best. We all asked for extra ranch with our meal and that never came. I ordered an appetizer before our food came out and it showed up after our main course and still came out wrong. The owner and another manager came to our table and explained that the restaurant was busy, but that was obviously not the case because I was able to see first hand how empty the restaurant was. Not a single employee that I was able to see moved with a purpose, but instead acted like they were on a Sunday stroll. Bartenders were busy chatting which I noticed later was the reason why it took so long to get simple beers. Now I see why we were able to be seated so quickly and why the restaurant lacked a dinner rush.",

The outdoor area is awesome, but they allow people,to smoke out there, so you do have to deal with that. In the past, this wouldn't be an issue for me (I don't smoke), but now that it's pretty much banned everywhere I am used to not smelling it or dealing with it, so it is startling to be around it.   They have a large selection of liquor here, and originally when I went they had a lot of bourbons, which I liked, but it seems that they have cut those options down (I understand it though cuz if it doesn't sell, your not gonna keep buying it).   My top two issues with this place is the food and the service. Some days the service is great, and others, it's mediocre. The food is just so so, not terrible, but not great.   In summary, it's a good place to grab a drink and hang out with friends, but it's just mediocre in general.",

Everything was DELICIOUS and half price during happy hour. The egg rolls were our favorite. They were crispy and filled with cream cheese and lots of avocado. The quesadilla was really good! Tons of chicken and cheese and came with this really good green salsa. The torpedoes were tasty, but I would've liked the jalapenos to be cooked a little longer. Some of them were not spicy and some of them were extremely spicy, which I guess happens with jalapenos so not really their fault. The waiter was very attentive! He checked on us probably five times during the hour we were there. We live close so this will be our new happy hour spot! There were so many appetizers that sounded delicious that we need to try.  Update: get the chicken poblano. Amazing.",

Now they are holding the line up so their bottle girls can come out to try to convince you to \"skip the line\" but you have to buy a bottle. Cheapest bottle is 150. When I finally got inside at almost 1 the place was empty but had a line around the building. The atmosphere was so off it just isn't the same anymore",

Turns out the large doors separating the patio and restaurant were open, so we choose to sit at a table inside, but bordering the patio - the best of both worlds.    We arrived 1:30 pm on a Thursday; the restaurant was not too busy so we somewhat expected decent service - but, WOW - Kudos to our server \"Genesis\" - she was exceptional!   She answered our many questions, continuously checked back and was a pleasure to work with.    Their menu is extensive.  Our food, a pork barbeque sandwich and fish tacos from the lunch menu, were very tasty and fresh.  We also shared an ice cream and brownie sundae, which I would highly recommend.  We will be back.",

However the chips were stale.  The torpedoes tasted great after we pulled the undercooked bacon off of them.  The bacon was cooked, it was just not crispy, still white and fatty. My husband's Moscow mule was not served in a copper cup. The copper cup is needed for the chemical reaction that occurs in this particular drink.  My husband ordered fish and chips and liked his meal a lot.  The fries were crispy and hot.  I ordered fish tacos.  the first ones I sent back to the kitchen.  They were too heavily salted for my taste.  My husband agreed. Our server brought fresh ones out in a flash.  These were tasty.  All in all,  I will not be returning to this restaurant.  I just was not comfortable in this space.  It was just a cold bar/restaurant that lacked the cozy cabin appeal. Lackluster in my opinion.",

I gave it 4 stars to bring up the average because the food was good and I have faith that the service will improve.  I'll try it again in the fall.",

    "text": "Slow Wednesday night, so we were seated right away.  Way too cold, but otherwise the restaurant was clean and attractive.  Initial service was prompt, but slowed as the evening progressed, because our server was assigned to outside and inside, which were on totally opposite sides of the restaurant.  She (McKenna) was good when we could get her attention, but due to the bar in the middle, that was difficult.  She was running all over the place, so this was not the case at all of a poor server.  She just got stuck trying to be in two places at once.  Monterey burger was very good , as was the chicken poblano.  Burger a good size meal, but the chicken could have been larger - the addition of some roasted veggies would have made it the perfect size.  Burger was not cooked medium (too pink), which we mentioned to our server to let the cook know not to rush things next time.  We told her it was fine and no need to get anyone in \"trouble\", but the manager (Nick) came over later with dessert as an apology.  Not expected or necessary, but very much appreciated.  The brownie, by the way, is tasty...someone finally put enough ice cream on a dessert to go with the main ingredient!  Overall a good experience.  Suggestions:  get rid of the black menu pages (hard to read), add some food pictures for interest and show the \"flavor\" of your food, and make it clearer on the menu what you get with your meal other than the meat; raise the restaurant temp on slow nights; be sure the server isn't stretched from one side to the other - not fair to them; and get rid of the skimpy shorts.  Nothing like a bare upper thigh at eye level (the booth seating is very low to the ground) when you are seated to make a married couple uncomfortable!  I'm sure we'll be back.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention...the cool looking motorcycle thing at the front door was neat, but hard to maneuver around when walking down the sidewalk.  Probably not a great place to park it...someone needing assistance walking would not have been able to get through easily.",

    "text": "After reading all of the negative reviews my wife and I decided to give The Cabin a try anyway since it's very convenient and we like an outdoor patio.  I was totally surprised how good everything was given how the place has been trashed so much on Yelp.   We got there about 1:00, were greeted and sat promptly on the patio by a smiling hostess.  I noticed several other tables were sat about the same time so I was prepared for the dreaded wait I had read about.  Since our server was a little backed up they had the bartender Neil wait our table.  We found him very pleasant and knowledgeable about the food and drink menu.  We're big sushi fans so we decided to give the Ahi appetizer a try (I know, scary).  The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly.  We got 10 good size pieces which I thought was good value given the price.  The platter was very well presented and included some dynamite pickled ginger.  My wife had a small order of baby backs for her main course.  She is doing no carbs so they gladly switched out the mashed potatoes for fresh vegetables.  The ribs were tender and seasoned well.  The vegetables were done with a little crunch which is just the way we like them.  As good as everything was to this point I hit the jackpot with the BLT sandwich.  The bread was toasted perfectly, tomatoes and lettuce fresh and I think there was a half pound of meaty delicious bacon.  Under the heading of if you are going to be a pig, be a big pig I had them add the fried egg to the sandwich.  I was impressed when Neil asked me how I would like me egg cooked which was something I had not thought of.  It came out perfectly over easy.  OMG what a taste treat.  Be sure your hungry when you order this, it's a very large portion.  Having been a gluten to this point we skipped desert.  I'm a wine drinker and found the by the glass list serviceable with a few good and well priced selections although I thought their two high end bottle selections were overpriced.  The cocktail menu looked interesting as well.  All in all a great experience.  If you decide to go, go with an open mind, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Lastly, the patio is dog friendly if you'd like to bring your pooch.",

I was the GM for one of the hottest night clubs in the north valley and was in the night club industry for many years. But here is my honest review...it takes to long to get drinks if you don't know one of the bartenders. It takes forever to get a cocktail waitress to get anything. The Dj's are good the security staff is on their game. I never really got the chance to get to know the new Gm but he seemed nice and knowledgeable about the business.  I guess my biggest complaint would be one of the owners who walks around with his nose in the air and god forbid if he doesn't like you for he will 86 you. I believe that the cabin could be the hot spot in the west valley if they right the few wrongs that they have. I am actually great full that I am not allowed in there I am saving roughly 1500 a month by not going there I truly wish them the best and hope that this review brings light to those that need to see it.",
