The stetson salad is very good with a generous portion of salmon, and the open face steak sandwich is steakhouse goodness on a bun.    The bread pudding is excellent with the right amount of sweet and a surprise bit of heat from some pepper flakes in the sauce.  Definitely ask for TJ if it is your first time in.  He will guide you based upon what you like and wont steer you wrong.  In addition, they can get you in and out quickly if you are pressed for time.",

I will go back and have a try of something else cause I don't want to just write off a place based on something like the West Coast Wrap, which could be a taste preference. I think I'll go and have a try of the mac and cheese and judge it off that cause that'll be a make or break thing for me lol.",

I walked on over and they initially had an issue with accepting cards and were cash only, but that was fixed by the time I left 2 drinks later.   There was open bar seating and I usually hate sitting at the bar by mself, but its the airport so eveyone is pretty much by themselves. Plus, i used the convienant outlets right underneath the countertop to charge my phone.   The bartender was great. I can't remember his name but he was helpful with recommendations and very entertaining as he sang to the overhead music.   I ended up getting a beer to start and then had a glass of Zinfandel to finish. The lady sitting next to me had it and recommended it, which was great. I had never actually had a glass of Zinfadel before then. It was funny because she had commented that no matter what time it is in the airport, people are always drinking. Granted it was 6pm when she said that, but her statment was True nonetheless.   She also got the quesadilla which apparentlynis a restaurant favorite. I guess I'll have to come back for that. Great experience and I would gladly come back again.",

Again, I didn't manage to catch her name, but let me tell you what this lady was DISGUSTING. When I had asked her how long our food had before being ready as our plane had already begun to board she proceeded to say things like \"oh well I can't help you with that.\" \"This is what happens when we have THOSE kinds of people working here.\" Referring to the sweet lady who had helped us earlier who was disabled and could barely walk. Her attitude towards us and towards her fellow coworker was appalling. I honestly wish I knew this woman's name so that she could get spoken to about her disgusting work ethic and attitude.",

I had more than 2 hours of layover here, so after spending money on stuff I did not need in the shops, I settled into here to wait out the rest of my time.   The menu had an assortment to suit most tastes, from salads, to grazing (appetizers), to some signature smaller bites and entrees covering all the tastes from carnivore to pescatarian to vegetarian. I loved the wide variety on the grazing menu with items like pork barbacoa, bison tartare, buffalo carpaccio, crispy porkbelly, quesadilla, and a cheese plate.   I settled in with the Truffled Mac & Cheese topped with potato chips and crisp panchetta paired with a nice Brut Rose (which they offered by the glass or bottle).   All I can say, is that this is not your father's airport food. I felt like I was in a trendy local spot. The food was delicious, the wine list impressive, and the service was some of the most attentive I have ever had (never mind that I was in an airport).   While I rarely get to pass through Phoenix, I would definitely seek out Cowboy Ciao, in Terminal 4, the next time a layover permitted.",

Started with some coffee of course, and ordered up the Chocolate Chip Pancakes, because I might as well board my flight and go right into a food coma.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy, with syrup...and some warm peanut butter to spread on them as well.   Mmmmm, carby, sugary goodness!  Filling for sure.  Not a bad place to grab breakfast before heading home.",

    "text": "Started off with yummy cocktails.   Both had interesting ingredients, very herby.  For lunch Mr B. enjoyed his Ruben sandwich with potato chips.   It was a very large portion,  we could have split it.   I ordered the steak sandwich, as I had been craving a steak all week.   When it arrived I was immediately disappointed in the size of the steak.  Two half dollar size medallions on a piece of french bread.   Like the old Burger King commercial stated,  \"where's the beef?!\"  There was a large portion of potato chips topped with gorgonzola , but the meat was almost non-existent.  I think at an $18 price point,  a larger piece of meat could be spared.   The manager happened to be making his rounds, so I told him of my plight.   He was very nice about it,  offered to get me more steak,  which I declined.   Interestingly he said the steak is weighed at 5oz.  Doubtful that was even close to 5oz.  Who ate my steak?!  The manager sent over a nice dessert  which was very thoughtful, and we were appreciative.     Our waiter was a polite gentleman and the ambiance is cool.   I'd come back again for drinks, but I'd stay away from the paltry streak.",

Frustrated servers couldn't even take away the quality and flavor of the dishes that were served.  Entrepreneur noted Cowboy Ciao as the best new airport restaurant, and I would venture to say it rivals most standard street restaurants. The Stetson Chopped salad with lemon grilled chicken was surprisingly out of this world! No joke. Thinking I may need to route all travel through Phoenix so I can visit this eatery.",

Also, the bread is very filling, make sure to have others to share it with.  The drinks were okay. The VIVA cocktail was very sweet (and I love sweet)! Very overwhelming for taste buds. The margarita was very good, just make sure to specify which kind of tequila you want. The sangria is one for sangria lovers. It grew on me, but first sip was kind of atrocious.

She comes back with 1 card and the bill charged on my card.  We ask for the other card...she can't find it.  The distance between our table and the cashier table was less than 3 feet.  For the next 10 very stressful minutes we tear the area apart searching for their card.  Security & the manager are called in to look.  My brother is ready to cancel the card.  Fortunately, a customer 2 seats down from us stands up and the security guard sees a card under his seat.  The restaurant manager did not even offer to compensate us for anything.  Are they running some sort of scam?  Not sure.",

I'll update my review and let you know how it tastes.  Update:  The Burrata salad is delicious!!!! You get a generous portion of real ooie-gooie Burrata, seasoned to perfection. Cherry tomatoes, arugula, avocado topped with crispy onions. I ordered with chicken. Everything is seasoned well, you can eat them separately or combine them. Either way, delicious.

The owner must be brilliant because they have all price ranges and just what you want when you are traveling combined with gourmet options.  Kenna took care of us, she was personable and professional, a usually tough balance.  The Punk had chicken and waffles. Her quotes, \"Everything is SO good!\" , \"I wish I could eat here again later!\", \"These are the best waffles I've ever had!\", \"We can eat here all the time and I will get the same thing over and over!\" Pretty sure she liked it.  They also offered to allow us to bring in nearby McDonald's for the Punk, so if you have little ones that like what they like, this is your best option.   I tried the pastrami style ribs, I must admit, they were different and really good. I would get them again even if they are the most expensive thing on the menu.  We had a guest diner who tried the sweet mustard slaw from the Punks plate. Although she is a mayo loving, mustard hating individual, she said she likes this slaw better than regular slaw.

Finally I chose to mozey in. Nice little table for two. Waitress, Jennifer, greeted me and brought my coffee. She was such sweetheart! I later decided to have either and mimosa or Bloody Girl and Jennifer assisted so authentically with that, asking if I liked spicy. Yes! I only wish it were 3hr later. But I did see several breakfast dishes and they were perfect. Breakfast potatoes looked just how I prefer! Oooooo I wish I could be hungry!! Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry would be my first choice. I just hope I can go through Phoenix on my next flight! And best of luck to Jennifer!",

The soup was very tasty as well as creamy. The salad, which was good however was meant apparently for a child. The salad, which is very pretty don't get me wrong is striped with tomatoes, sweet corn, tasted like corn pops as well as chicken. There is also trail mix thrown into the salad. The avocado ranch tastes homemade, but the portion size is ridiculously small!!  I would suggest giving a little more food to the customer considering your charging higher end restaurant fees for small portions in a airport! The host was really sweet too and had to throw how a drunk customer.",

The restaurant only had a couple of tables occupied and I'd guess about 90% empty at this time. The employee came up to the front and we asked to be seated. She proceeded to tell us that it was a safety hazard to have a stroller in the restaurant and that we could be seated by the rail and we would have to leave our sleeping baby in the stroller in the terminal hallway just outside of the restaurant. Clearly I was in shock at this request. This was our baby's first flight and he just fell asleep after having troubles popping his ears during the flight. Clearly I am not going to leave him anywhere but next to us. I proceeded to tell her we would find food elsewhere. I will NEVER eat here. Thank you to a very busy \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" restaurant across the airport who had no problem seating me and my family with the stroller.",

You can tell they're beginning with fresh ingredients and high quality cuts of meat. If I were ever in a part of Phoenix other than the airport you can bet your @$$ I'd be headed to their location on Stetson, especially if the awesome service here is a consistent factor there.   I want to be clear, I have liked both my servers so much that when the incredibly rude couple that just left came in to sit here and eat McDonalds (seriously, what the heck? go sit at a gate like everyone else who wants to eat that garbage) I got offended that my charming waitperson had to even speak to them.

Are you serious? The Stetson Chop is your staple and I know it would take less than 3 to plate that thing.   3. Hire wait staff that aren't rude, lazy, and haughty.   I know this location does huge business, but that's because they're the only restaurant down the B wing. Honestly you're better off taking an extra 10 minutes and getting food elsewhere.   We're not going back, and are even considering never going back to the Old Town location because of how we were treated at the airport location.   We can find the Stetson Chop recipe online anyway! Hahaha",

Finally, I was seated in the back. It was so noisy that people had to scream to be heard. I was traveling alone so I just put on my noise canceling headphones. A weird way to eat, but it worked.  My waiter was actually really nice. He made great recommendations, was engaging, and made sure that my hot water pot was always full for my cup of tea.  The food itself was ok. Despite the large crowd, it was ready in a normal amount of time. The thing I like about this place is the variety. When you travel alot, the options seem to be burgers or salads. Expect something a little different here.   If they turned the TVs down a little bit, I would come on every trip",

I appreciate the honesty, but the margarita I ordered instead was a major disappointment. My husband's bloody Mary was watery and tasted like a bad mixer. His meal of Chorizo Enchiladas was a little bland, but not bad. I really enjoyed the flavors and textures of the Pig 'n Puddin' (or some spelling variation), but the polenta was more of a cream-of-wheat consistency than the toothier texture I expected.

If you're not getting kicked by calves in the branding chute, or rammed by an angry mother cow, you're working sunup to sundown with no relief. That is until supper time.   Our cook, while rudimentary compared to professional chefs, knew how to cook every type of desert dweller the hands shot daily, but mostly quail and beef.  Well not since my starry-eyed youth have I tasted a filet sandwich like the one served up at Cowboy Ciao.  The sandwich will arrive open-faced with a ramequin of brown gravy, a knoll of thin, juicy fries, (more like pomme frites), and a side of slaw. All delectable.   The filet transcends any level of tender I'm used to, since my version of tender resides squarely between London broil, and skirt steaks.  No gnawing (or gumming) your food here. No siree.  If you have the time between flights, settle in for a few, have the steak, and imagine what it'd be like to eat beef every day and night for three months. You'd get so stopped up, you'd probably shit in yer saddle...on roundup...in full view of the senior hand who like to beat you up on Friday nights at the Punkin Center Saloon.  I wish someone would invent a time machine.  I'd go back and fuck him up. BADLY.",

We asked a worker at a gift shop what her favorite food spot is in the airport. She immediately directed us to Cowboy Ciao.  Passing this place on our way to our next gate, I saw how packed it was. It looked more like a bar to me, since the bar sits in the middle of the mini-restaurant with giant big screen TVs. They do have lounge seating, which is convenient for small (1-2 people) or semi-large parties (6 people seating). There are also small tables, but it didn't feel cramped to me.  We ordered the Stetson salad, and it was the best salad I've ever tasted! I also recommend their Open Faced Steak Sandwich. It's basically two pieces of filet mignon on top of soft french bread and topped with the most delicious sauce. It's not the type of sandwich you'd imagine. We both shared both meals and it filled us up, so the portion size is pretty decent.   The price is about average (being a tad bit expensive on their pricier meal menus), but the food is definitely an original and the taste is impeccable! I wish we had this restaurant in Houston!",

It took a little longer than I like for someone to come over and take my drink order but the waitress made up for it by being very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.   Very tasty and way above the norm of what you'd expect to get at an airport.",

First moments: I asked for a Gluten-Free menu due to my wife's allergy (Celiac), the host/waiter literally laughed and said \"no\". We then went through the menu and the waiter was \"kind\" enough to explain how some things are prepared. We were able to figure out how to accommodate my wife.  Another member of my party is lactose intolerant...asking for non-dairy creamer and again, another response of \"no, only milk or half/half\".  The food arrived and it was reported that one of our party's meal was \"forgot\"...and \"...they were starting it right now.\" I was 3/4 done with my food when his came out of the kitchen.    The server eventually became attentive and respectful towards the end of the experience. He then offered to let us hang out in our seats to be more comfortable than in the airport loun  The food we did order was good by all members of our party (5). The service and accommodations are simple fixes.",

Chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. And although a bit tough, the red velvet waffle complemented the rest of the dish well.   The shrimp were incredible; the perfect heat and light, crisp breading. The pickled carrots were the best Ive ever had.  The dessert was the perfect ending to a truly amazing meal.   Service was average; the two waitresses seemed upset with someone and were overly chatty with each other, which left our glasses empty and cleaned plates sitting longer than acceptable.  Even with this, I cannot give our experience less than 5 stars.  The restaurant space and location was nice and clean.  The big open windows gave us a lovely view of Old Town.",

I was really excited to try the chopped salad with avocado and steak, per one of the reviewers on yelp, but the waitress said that wasn't an option. Fail. Since I was craving steak, I ordered the testosterone salad and the bruschetta duet. The salad was really rich, and I have mixed feelings on the drunken cherries. The steak was really nicely cooked, and the potato chips were a good crunch. If you love bleu cheese, definitely get this salad!  The bruschetta, however, was meh. It comes with 4 pieces generously topped with sauteed mushrooms and chopped tomatoes (separately). The bread was far too buttered, and the toppings were just okay. I could do better at home myself.  It is VERY loud sitting in the dining area because there's the gate intercom speakers right above, so don't even think about talking on the phone. The staff were nice, but everybody looked like they hadn't slept in days and had ultimate resting bitch face.",

Exclamation point.  Cowboy Ciao (what a great name) is terrific.  Sky Harbor, the Phoenix Airport, has morphed into one of the finest airports in the Country and really caters to the Foodies of the world.  Each gate has its own micro epicurean stranglehold to keep you nourished and delighted without having to wander to a different gate to indulge in typical fast food fare.  Cowboy Ciao is definitely part of a heavyweight triumvirate of restaurants in this corridor of Sky Harbor.  Although we were there during the peak breakfast hours, we were allowed to order anything off the menu, always great if you're not in the mood for breakfast or your internal clock is screaming for dinner.    I ordered the breakfast enchiladas.  This was a meal worth the money ($14.99) in value and taste.  Perfect over-easy eggs blanketed enchiladas with chorizo and potatoes on a bed of homemade chili verde that was fantastic.  Service was terrific, understood we had a plane to catch, food came out quickly and check was promptly taken care of.    As you travel through Phoenix, bring your appetite and definitely explore some excellent replicas of True Phoenician restaurants that native desert rats like myself enjoy daily.  Cowboy Ciao is high on my list-well done!",

What really impressed me though was the service. I sat at the bar and had some wine and the bartenders were all very friendly even though the place was packed. My bartender was a dark haired woman with lots of tattoos and she was possibly the friendliest bartender I've ever had even though there were a ton of people that needed her attention. Based on my experience with her alone I'll make sure I seek out this place next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Is it sad to say I was actually excited to go to the airport early? I really was, and all because one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix is at the airport. Yes, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport actually is a gourmet mecca with places like Cowboy Ciao, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, and Chelsea's Kitchen finding their home there (just to name a few). Now, other airports just don't compare!  This menu at the airport compared to the menu at the original location in Scottsdale has some variations. Due to the diverse types of people from across the country, or even outside of the country, that encounter this restaurant, the Stetson salad can come with shredded chicken instead of the traditional salmon for example. The \"equal parts\" of each salad ingredient idea has taken the culinary scene by storm. Its recipe was even featured in the prestigious Phoenix Magazine, known for its literary prowess in describing new restaurant hot spots. Being a meat-a-tarian, it's hard to admit that it is one of the... Oh well let me be honest. It IS my favorite salad!  I paired my stetson salad with a bourbon drink.. Well actually two of them and ordered the truffled macaroni and cheese (also a Cowboy Ciao staple) because it's nothing short of awesome! Sprinkle anything with truffles (or truffle oil, but truffles preferably), and your taste buds with explode with overwhelming flavor.   Our waitress made a mistake and ordered us bruschetta instead of the truffled mac and cheese when putting the order in, so she gave the bruschetta appetizer to us out of the kindness of her heart and sincerely apologized. I'm glad she did because with all the other intriguing menu items, I probably would've ordered something a little more adventurous than bruschetta, but I'm so glad that she did, because we loved the bruschetta! The edges of the bread were crispy but the center was soft but strong enough to hold either the tomatoes and cheese or the mushrooms and cheese, depending on what bite you were holding at the time. So simple, but so good! Definitely worth a bite.. or several!  It kills me that some people will stop by this restaurant and just think it's an average airport bar-restaurant gig, when it's actually something amazing.",

That is why today I welcomed a 2 hour layover around dinner time so I could go to cowboy ciao for a delicious open face steak sandwich.    I walked from a17, which is about a 10 minute walk, but not a problem when I know what delicious food lies ahead.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a table I was seated and promptly ordered.   When my food came it was nothing like I remember. The steak itself was hardly warm, like it had been sitting out for 5 minutes waiting to be delivered. The demi glaze was virtually non-existent and the ciabatta was bordering the heel and challenging to cut through. It was lacking. For $18 I expect it to be pretty tasty.   After delivering the sandwich my server never returned to the table to check on me or even refill my water glass until she brought the bill. If she had come by I probably would have mentioned the temperature.     Overall, it was not that bad, especially by airport standards.  The experience was just so much less stellar than I remember, and the poor service bumped it from a 3 to a 2.   Cowboy ciao you can do better than this. Make me want to give you another shot.",

I think too much fresh basil was used but I'm the least biggest fan of basil so take that as it's worth. We also ordered chips with a side of pesto dipping sauce. The sauce and chips were good. Prices are airport prices so be prepared for that. I would stop here again if I were in the phx airport for some drinks and quick snacks. Oh, a mimosa is $13... Maybe I won't be back...",

For real, I have 500 songs on my mp3 player ('08) and one of them is Hap'nin by Bernard Purdie (arguably the most sampled drummer of all time, really), so I was natutally excited to hear funky jams while drinking local IPA's despite plane delay. I forgot I was at the airport, and that's all that mattered to me at the time. Good chats with crazy folks from all over 'Merica, and amazingly swift and beyond competent service.

    "text": "If you're like most people, the customer service you receive at an establishment is what will make it or break it for you. The cost of dining out is so exorbitantly high (especially at airports) that you would THINK an emphasis would be placed on customer service, right? Even decent customer service can offer some justification of the money you're doling out for airport food fare.   For this reason, I usually don't visit a restaurant without first reading the reviews. Cowboy Ciao (Phoenix airport) has received favorable reviews because it does serve pretty decent food and it's a nice place to go for drinks and catch a game or two if you have a long layover.   What made my experience a negative one was because of the hostess. I'm pretty sure her name was Kimberly. I went there today around 1pm. I was the FIRST of three people waiting in line for a table. When she came to seat us, she immediately grabbed the SECOND guy in line and said, \"Dave, right this way\". HE was even surprised that she skipped me to get to him as evidenced by the look of delighted surprise on his face and his response of, \"Seriously?\" As she marched him to the last available table, I looked back at the THIRD guy in line who shrugged his shoulders and laughed. When the hostess returned, I was fully expecting her to escort me to at least a comparable table but what she said was that there weren't any tables left! Instead, there were high-chaired seats against the wall where you get a beautiful frontal view of all the hustle and bustle going on in the kitchen, while you dine facing away from the TV. (Can you detect my sarcasm? ) I get that you may want to give special treatment to who I'm presuming to be a regular patron but there was absolutely no justification for that. I'm sure Dave would've come back even if you seated him in the kitchen. I, on the other hand, am forming my first impression of the place and that could've cost the restaurant my business as well as whoever else was in line after guy #2.   So as upset as I was, I took the seat in front of the kitchen because I wanted to give the place a shot despite the unprofessionalism exhibited by the hostess. I ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese, the Burrata Insalata and the Cornbread Bread Pudding. I enjoyed the Insalata the least but the Mac & Cheese and bread pudding were pretty good. My server James was nice and attentive. Was the food enough to make me return and drop another $37 on food & gratuity after the hostess set the tone for my experience there? Nope.   I hardly ever write reviews but my experience with the rude hostess at CowBoy Ciao motivated me to write about it. And from now on, I will write reviews for good experiences too because establishments that provide good service should receive a positive shout out.",

I walked back in to get my receipt I forgot, and a jackass barked at me to \"back up....wait in my line!\" (And pointed back outside of the restaurant) I began to explain I, \"....wasn't waiting for a seat I need my....\" he interrupts \"I don't care, you wait in my line!\"     Mmmm so guess what?  You don't get away with snapping at me. I don't care either.    Last time I eat here.  Not worth the hassle, wait, arrogance and not too bright clown who has zero listening skills.",

I ask her to void the wrong charge and she proceeds to tell me it won't go through. Um wrong then I say the card has already been charged she argues with me that it won't go through ans she tells me it isn't authorized until she puts on the tip. I should have left her a big fat zero but I left a small tip And her service was crappy and I just don't have time to argue I'm at the airport to catch a flight ... my credit card company will take care of it but just because you have a captive audience doesn't mean you can't provide mediocre serve...",

It included some stuff that I didn't want on it but it was served an marbled rye bread.  The sandwich was good and creative.  The rest of the menu appeared to be creative as well.  I didn't have a drink but there is a bar there that is quite large.  I did have good service from TJ and was happy that I was able to make it out in time.

I always expect airport food to be overpriced and under deliver and with many people rushing to their flights sometimes quality is given up for speed. Here at Cowboy Ciao we received some great food, filled water glasses and made our flight with no issues. I grabbed the Stetson Salad because as soon as I saw the pictures on Yelp I had to have it. Anytime I can grab smoked salmon I am in and this salad was perfect. There was couscous, crunch and delicious bites of salmon. I was definitely satisfied after this salad and will be trying to replicate it at home. I also heard the Chicken and waffles were great, but I was too occupied with the salad to even know there were other people at the table.   If you like colorful and delicious things you should try it!",

I was hoping for a side of ranch or cheese for the fries but they do not carry either of those. I'd give them more than 3 starts but the service was less than favorable. It seemed that I had to beg for the things I should've got: silverware, water, and the check. They weren't overly busy when I went so I'm not sure why the service lacked.

The chips served with it are excellent, the piece of advice I offer up is to be careful of the blue cheese on the chips.  Mild is not a word that goes with this cheese.

I fly through the Phoenix airport frequently and generally only have time to grab a bite near my gate, forcing me to chose the lesser of two evils, which used to be cowboy ciao. Their food is very overpriced and significantly less than satisfactory. I have dietary restrictions which makes it hard for me to eat most types of meat, for safety, I typically opt for the vegetarian option. I picked up the only salad they offered that had no meat listed in the ingredients, confirmed with the cashier there was no meat, and returned to my seat only to find a layer of bacon underneath the lettuce. When I returned to the restaurant they made no effort to exchange, refund, or apologize. It is clear to me that they have a complete disregard for their customers and have a dangerous attitude towards the quality of their food.",

My husband and I chose Cowboy Ciao which is one of our local favorites.   We were seated right away, but that's about the only positive of the entire dinner. I noticed they had a couple of all day breakfast options and even though it was dinner time, I was in the mood for breakfast.   When the server came over I specifically asked if these all day breakfast options were truly available all day and she said yes. So we quickly ordered because we were trying to catch our flight and I ordered breakfast.   Some time after we ordered my husband had a clear view of the kitchen line. He could see his Reuben sitting in the window. Finally our server came to inform us they ran out of biscuits to make my order.  They took so long to tell me this that I did not have time to order something else and have them prepare it before our flight.    They brought out my husband's Reuben and because it was sitting in the window for so long it was luke warm!   We tried to split it but it was really terrible. At this point the server came up and told us the manager had graciously offered to comp our ice teas for me not being able to eat. He never once asked how we liked the Rueben that was mostly untouched left on the plate.   We were unfortunately forced to pay for the Reuben and left hungry! Pathetic!! But the worst part was we stopped at McDonald's a couple doors down to grab something so we wouldn't starve on the plane and I made eye contact with the manager of Cowboy Ciao while we were standing in the McDonald's line.   So not only did we have to pay for something that was terrible, the manager saw that we were still hungry and still did nothing to try to fix the situation! Stay clear of this place it is definitely not like the Cowboy Ciao in Old Town!!",

Also a decent wine selection. P.S. Their smoked salmon Stetson salad is also amazing!",

The server we eventually got tried to make the excuse that the bartender is busy, but you could tell that he was just an ass. When we only ended up ordering drinks from the bar, it was evident that even the server was perplexed why the bartender didn't jst take our order.

The food is on par with the traditional establishment and far exceeds what you would expect to find at an airport. However, with that comes a relatively hefty price compared to typical 'airport food'. If you're ok with paying more to avoid the traditional grab and go Chili's/Applebee's fare then give this place a shot. Restaurant is spacious enough and servers/bartenders recognize that you have someplace to be without bring pushy or rushing you.  I'll be back!",

No hello or any greeting, just walks us to the table and then throws the menus down and walks away! So I said - oh thanks - sorry we missed your sign! I got the look of death. The waiter was nice enough - the menu was boring and pricey. Didn't even bother with an appetizer after that hostess treated us like dirt. 20 bucks for a glass of wine, a beer and a Sprite!

My boyfriend and I had four hours to kill on a layover from Durango, Colorado back to sunny California so we swung in for a couple of beers and some light fare. As always, we chose to sit at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman with a genuine smile and an enthusiastic attitude (but by no means pushy!). Tige was not only attentive and friendly, but he truly made us feel welcome in a sea of unfamiliar faces. Furthermore, (and I should add that I'm also in the service industry), I happened to observe his interactions with other guests and found that he didn't discriminate in his style of service; he was knowledgable and eager to ensure that everyone was comfortable. Tige is truly a man that's proud of his craft. I can't say I'll be back anytime soon as I'm situated in another state, but if I find myself in the desert again I'll be sure to pay him a visit. Cowboy Ciao, you have a top of the line, outstanding bartender on your hands- do whatever it takes to keep him!",

Normally I am wandering around concourses C or D...but...same old, same old...plus my local Mexican cantina was closed down...so I wander down to concourse B for something different...and I discover Cowboy Ciao...the host was friendly, greeted me right away and seated me right away.  My waitress, Monique, was both friendly and knowledgeable.  She recommended a wonderful, rich, smooth Cab.  I ordered their Puerco Lento (lovely slow roasted pork on the bone dish) with only vegetables...soft, tender, melt in your mouth pork...so surprising to find this in an airport.  Loved it!  The tables were full, littered with business travelers...so it appears to be a well known spot for those of us that live in airports.  If you haven't tried it, don't wait.  Grab a seat, order a nice drink, have a little slice of comfort after a long day...cheers!",

I have been to Cowboy Ciao a few times now and have always had great service. The food is quite good, especially by traditional airport standards.   The staff is excellent, and they know the menu.  If you are in the Phoenix Airport (terminal 4) you should try Cowboy Ciao.  The Calgary flights depart from here so you sun worshipping Cowtowners are a perfect audience.     Two coronas and the Reuben were $30.  Not bad for airport pricing.  The steak sandwich is also quite good.",

The breakfast menu was small with only 5 items but they all looked good so I thought I would give it a go.  My waitress sat me fast and obviously had too much coffee this morning but no big deal, she was nice. I opted for the Monday Quesadilla, apparently they decide what's inside every Monday.  Mine was filled with Oaxaca and Jack cheese, short rib and egg topped with chipotle sour cream drizzle and fresh Pico de gallo.  YUM!  I scarfed it up so fast my waitress thought I dropped the plate.  Airport food at Phoenix Sky Harbor has definitely been changing for the better and this was just another example of how a local restaurant can serve the same great food in an airport location.  Next time I'll try the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!",

I was seated and I ordered my food and drink at the same time, since I already know airport restaurants usually take a little longer for service. It took about 20 min for the server to even bring me my soda and said my food was on the way. I waited another 30 minutes for the server to come back out and tell me that they ran out of shrimp and they couldn't make my order and asked if I would like to order anything else. At this point I was already cutting it close for my flight so I told him no and he still had the nerve to tell me he'd be right back with the check for the 1 soda I had. I couldn't believe he didn't even offer to comp the $3 soda after he had already told me my food was on the way and took almost an hour to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. Worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant.",

When I want to place my order he gives me s*** that I'd have wait my turn which \"for sure takes another 10 min hehehe....\". At this point I am ready to walk but give it another 30sec. Cancel the ordered drink and earn a loud and clear \"PERRRRFECT\".   Picture of 'person' posted. Keep away from maniac and this hole.

Might have been better if the waitress - Monique - had actually cared. When I pointed it out, she huffed and said, \"what would you like me to do, take it back?\"  Can't remember the last time I left a ZERO tip. Poor food is not the fault of the server. In this case the food was only exceeded in its poor quality by the server's attitude.   And to continue the rant - it takes a ton of attitude for a restaurant to think its food is so tasty that they don't need to put salt & pepper shakers on the table. The chef at Cowboy Ciao must think his poop doesn't smell - but he's wrong.  I travel for business 10-15 days a month - eat in airports nearly every day I'm on the road. Cowboy Ciao is right up at the top of my worst experience list.",

But unfortunalely, every change they made resulted in a less-enjoyable sandwich.  1) The shreaded short rib meat -- reheated on the grill before being put into the sandwich --  was tough; a far cry from scrumptious pastrami cut thin across the grain.  2) The cabbage compote was tasty, but with only a very subtle acidic bite; a far cry from traditional sauerkraut.  3) The marbled rye was toasted, rather than grilled, which made its edges dry and tough. Unpleasant.  4) Cheese was extra ... and pepper jack, not traditional Swiss, was the only option  ... for an additional $1 (which was initially billed as $1.50).  On the plus side, the chips were excellent! Perfectly crispy and neither too greasy or too salty.",

Took about 10 minutes for 2 of us to be seated, which I thought was pretty good. Good beers and pretty good food, with a wait, which was fine. I got the chicken and waffles, the waffles were good, a little crispy but I liked them. Had a couple of the only IPA on the menu. My favorite part of eating here: the lovely Canadian couple sitting next to us. Complete strangers, super nice and such a treat to have a nice conversation with really great people. Remember: not everyone is going to bite your head off if you say hi or ask them how they're doing!",

I quickly scanned the menu before going in and sitting down and the only thing that really caught my eye was the filet mignon. Everything else was pretty mediocre.  The space is really small but they don't GAF, they've got tables crammed in to where you'll be touching elbows with your neighbor. It's like a family of 8 trying to cram all their kids into their two door Honda Civic. That's how I felt! No lie!  Received my food, my filet mignon ($33) was tough. The flavor was pretty good but the meat quality just wasn't filet mignon quality. The mashed potatoes were lame, made with some type of Dijon mustard, I don't like my potatoes to taste sweet unless it's yams.  I'll be coming back to Phoenix soon but this place has been crossed off my list.",

At the time I agreed with the reviews putting it as some of the best airport food in America. Sadly their attention to detail and customer service is not up to the standards that you will find in their Scottsdale location. Today I had to go through asking to order  four menu items before we hit one that was actually available. I asked the waitress why their menu was not up to date and that she should let her manager know- her response was that her management did know the menu was not up to date. Wine spectator once reviewed this restaurant as wine friendly yet there was not one option of a Pinot Noir by the glass available - again despite them having it listed on the menu.  I will improve my rating as the manager tried to make it right by comping our sandwich. The quality of the food was still not what it used to be as the sandwich was soggy but I appreciate his effort.",

The little airport restaurant is really pretty with interesting lighting and lamps, a large bar, and exceptionally comfy booths.  I was greeted and taken to a booth in the corner where I was hoping I could sip some wine and while away the time till my flight. My server was super friendly and educated on gf and guided me on the few gluten free options on the menu. He knew a lot about celiac so it was awesome when he told me he'd caution the kitchen about preparing my snack in a safe place with clean gloves and utensils.   I ordered the elote corn appetizer with corn chips and enjoyed the lovely presentation. After only a bite or two I found something in the middle of the nicely constructed elote mound that didn't belong, a fettuccine noodle.   It was super frustrating that an ingredient that should not at all be found in this appetizer and was a huge gluten contamination after the kitchen was warned about safe food prep. Unfortunately,  I couldn't eat more and knew I would be sick in the next hour.   I did appreciate that the manager came over and was not only apologetic but also asked how he could improve gf awareness in his kitchen. I very much enjoyed the friendliness and customer service of both the server and manager and hope that they will be able to improve the safety of their kitchen for individuals with food allergies.",

    "text": "So, I had to head out to Nevada for work - and as I am wont to do, I scheduled my layovers (length AND location) based on meal times.  Lunch in Charlotte, NC and dinner in Phoenix.  Wandered the airport, and with the aid of Gate Guru and Yelp - found this place.  And boy, am I glad I did.  I was seated quickly, ordered my beer and started perusing the menu.  As I read the menu - I noticed that they were carrying primal cuts of meat, and fresh vegetables and proteins into the kitchen.  That's a good sign for any restaurant, much less one in an airport.    I was debating between a couple menu items, and when the waiter came by - I asked which he would order.  He said if I don't find myself in Phoenix very often (which I don't), I should definitely try the Lester.  So, as I have found out in the past - trust a server's recommendation.  Wow.  Just wow.  I don't think I have a vocabulary large enough to describe the flavor explosion that happened in my mouth.  It was AMAZING.  A perfectly cooked burger, topped with bacon, green chili pulled pork, and avocado.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I'm writing this review three months later!  Service was very good, and - it's definitely a good place to grab a bite on your way to your connection.  I was in and out within 40 minutes (I had a 1 1/2 hour lay over) - and I assume had I not ordered the large beer, and taking it to go - I would have definitely made my flight with plenty of time to spare.  The only downside?  It's in an airport, so the atmosphere (I was seated right next to the hustle/bustle of people trying to make their connections) leaves a little to be desired in certain parts of the restaurant.  But, on the other hand - I've never thought higher than 3 stars for any food in a restaurant in an airport before.  So, the next time I find myself at Phoenix Sky Harbor - I know where I'm headed for dinner!",

So the girl depicted in my photograph finally approached me and then scolded me for having not followed whatever protocol they have for establishing a tab.

    "text": "Situated opposite gate B21, Cowboy Ciao was work the hike from terminal C. Restaurants at airports tens to be sub par and expensive. However my experience here was quality food and fairly expensive.   Firstly the ambience and service was great. My server was super friendly and was able help me through the various tantalizing dishes on display. I finally went with the exotic Mushroom dish, served on double baked Polenta. This dish consisted of 9 different types of mushrooms in a delicious cream sauce.  This entree is rich in flavor and is pretty substantial.   I struck up a conversation with another traveller who had their signature salad. I had a taste - was refreshingly delicious and if you are looking for something lighter this is definitely a salad worth trying!!  I give it 4 stars ... But the prices are a little on the high side, so I give it 3.8.",

I ordered the Upper Manhattan for a cocktail - which was made perfectly. I also tried the Testosterone Salad and it was amazing. Grilled beef tenderloin with leafy greens, huge raisins and Maytag blue cheese. It doesn't get any better than this. The meat was cooked perfectly and all the flavors really came together. For a first time visit, this salad really hit it out of the park for me.   They have a really nice wine selection here, and the range of food to choose from will make any foodie happy. The atmosphere here is also different. I can't put my finger on it - but the bartenders keep the customers entertained and everyone seems to really have a good time here.   I will definitely stop here again next time i'm passing through terminal 4. Given the typical lousy airport food options most travelers are used to, you need to give this place a try!",

However I was seated and greeted very quickly. Our server was fantastic. Highly attentive and very personable.   After perusing the menu for a while, it was very hard to choose as things seemed out of my normal dining choices, not bad, just different. So my motto is when in doubt grab a damn burger. So I got the pulled pork burger and my daughter, as usual, had a grilled cheese. (If you ever wonder where the good grilled cheese sandwiches are located, just ask me.)  My burger showed up and looked simply delicious. I could not wait to taste it!! I cut it in half and took my first bite....and I was slightly disappointed. It was lacking in all the flavor the menu description promised. The chips that came with it were okay but also tasted like nothing. I ate half of the burger then started to read my book. About 10 minutes later I picked at a few of the pieces of pork and avocado that had fallen off the burger and scooped them up with the chips. So good! It was like the meat needed to sit for a minute to get some flavor lol.   Bow the burger as a whole was not horrible. The meat was very good and tender and cooked perfectly for me. (I ordered it medium.) Even after we spilt a glass of water all over the booth the server was still very nice and just ran over to help as much as he could.",

I may have misunderstood his name, but I was clear about his actions and mannerisms when I spoke with the manager Memo.  We approached the entrance and no one was in-line and he didn't even look up to say hello. When he did look up, he gave us a disgusting look! There were only two of us and the place was not full. The first table he brought us to, he threw the menus on the table and we asked if he would mind moving us to a more quiet area towards the back. He then rolled his eyes and didn't move. So, I took charge and requested to sit at a one of the open tables in the back. Once we arrived, he threw the menus on the table and walked away. I asked him nicely with his back turned was his manager available. He ignored me until I touched his shoulder. I let him know he was providing the worst customer service I had ever experienced, almost borderline racism as we're a mixed black and Asian couple.  We brought it to the attention of Memo, who immediately apologized and was accommodating. We made it clear we don't need anything. Our sole intent was to help him understand what took place and he said he would speak to him.   We still ordered our food and left the customary 20% tip!   We all have bad days, but this went well beyond the treatment anyone should experience. Love the atmosphere and the food!",

We got the Stetson Chopped Salad minus the meat and cheese and a vinaigrette instead of whatever normally comes with it. The woman who seemed to have a limp and probably some health problems (she mentioned she can't eat broccoli or tomatoes) was running the show, going out of her way for us and even walking back to the kitchen when she caught them putting cheese in our salads. She stopped that like a sheriff in charge of her county and while we worried about her getting around, we couldn't have been more grateful. (Give that woman a raise!)   Our food was ready quickly and the manager even came out to see if we had been taken care of. Again, awesome customer service.   The menu is limited for vegans but we made it work and the Stetson Chopped Salad was quite good. It has freeze-dried fresh corn (new to me) and we got avocado instead of chicken.  Really really good. It already comes with cous cous which makes it quite filling.    The food was decent but if I could make that cashier my grandmother and take care of her forever I would.

The portion is a little small for me but great taste. Good news boys, this salad is not a leafy green salad. It can carry it self as a \"man's salad\". This is a goodee. Also for those of you who love avocado and/or bacon, ask for it to be added and the staff is more than happy to accommodate. I only added the chicken and was happy.  Now for the down side. Ordered the shrimp with polenta. The description on the menu sounds fab but it really falls short. One of my pet peeves is bars or restaurants serving limes that are \"woody\" or have no juice. It is annoying....stop doing it! So the polenta was dry and had a poor texture. The shrimp were not over cooked but they had no flavor. ...and the lime had apparently crossed the desert before being plated  Safe travels! I'll be back for the salad.",

I was on the fence between testosterone salad and flat iron.  After some research on yelp and ig, I decided on the testosterone salad. Glad I did.   It was tasty and refreshing.   The tendeloin steak was not medium rare but was still tender. Service was ok.  We asked for hot water and the guy said they don't have any, only tap.  How can you have a full bar and full kitchen but no hot water? Price is as expected at an airport, inflated to take advantage of hungry travelers. Location is nice, good ambience.  Great spot for people watch with counter seats facing the gates.  Food 4* Service 3* Price 3* Location 4*",

    "text": "3  1/2 stars for Cowboy Ciao.  I had a few hours to kill at PHX, so I literally walked up and down the terminals checking out all of the restaurants. I would've just used Yelp, but was having difficulty with the phone app that day. After working up an appetite, I decide to get a big ol' burger and fries so I landed at Cowboy Ciao. Good news, they had burgers! Bad news, they did NOT have French Fries. Doh! I seriously considered leaving, but decided I was too tired from my walk-a-thon and would have to live without fries.  As most airport restaurants, space was tight between tables. Since I was by myself, it was okay, as I placed my carry-on on one chair and my backpack on another. I ordered \"Lester's Burger Bonanza\" which was served with green chile pork, avocado, bacon, and homemade chips. If they could make chips, why couldn't they make fries? Deep fried is deep fried. *sigh* Anyway, I'm a big wimp when it comes to anything spicy, so I asked for the jalapeno aioli on the side. One plus for Cowboy Ciao is that they will cook a burger to order instead of cooking it well done by default. I like a nice medium rare burger, thank you.  When he brought out my burger, it didn't look right. You know why? No french fries! Ha ha! Just kidding. He forgot the pork. Once we got that squared away, I was ready to devour my burger. This was a pretty sizable burger, especially since it was on a big ol' Challah roll. I just squished it down and went at it. It was definitely a messy burger, but I must've made it look good, because the two ladies next to me asked me what I had.   I was stuffed when I was done, so that's always a good thing. You know airport food isn't cheap, so I won't even bother mentioning the price. If you are craving a burger and fries, Cowboy Ciao isn't your place. However, if the fries aren't a deal-breaker, I'd recommend Cowboy Ciao and specifically the Lester's Burger Bonanza.",

My favorite is the Breakfast Quesadilla, but you can't really go wrong with any of the options they have. They also have great coffee, which I usually drink at least four cups of.   Overall 5/5, definitely go here next time you're at the airport",

I had the  tiger prawns with grits, the tomato basil soup, the fried chicken sandwich and the wagyu burger. All the food was cooked well and had great ingredients. The grits were very bland, but the prawns were fresh and cooked well. The fried chicken sandwich was crisp and flavorful. The fries were thick cut and fresh. I asked for  a medium well burger, and they over cooked it. The patty was bland and lacking in character. It was definitely not wagyu. The cheese,sauce, and brioche bun made up for the lack over flavor. The prices were a bit high, but it was a decent meal altogether.",

Its presented with each ingredient piled into a line, one next to the other and is served with a pesto buttermilk dressing. The flavor combination is so good. It's definitely a one of a kind salad.  I wasn't a fan of the restaurant's version of a Moscow Mule. My server did warn me that it was different and made with a smoky liquor, which I thought I'd be okay with, however it did taste more like tequila instead of vodka, and overpowered the drink. Very much the opposite of what I know a Moscow Mule to be.   Lastly, I'm not sure why they don't serve the salad with your normal set of utensils. I'd assumed it was a one-off, but after three visits and only two large mixing spoons provided each time, I have to assume the idea is spoon feed the salad to oneself......Anyway, be proactive and order utensils with your salad, or walk to the hostess to grab a set like I did, because I don't know anyone who can eat a salad without a fork.",

I saw this place on the information board and saw it was listed as Mexican, so I figured, \"Hell Yeah!\"  I would not classify this place as Mexican.  It's moreso a blend of many different cultures, and kind of hard to explain.  After I glanced at the menu, I realized that really the only thing I would eat is the burger, which I didn't really want, but oh well. Was already sat down and had a beer in front of me.  The patty and bacon was alright, nothing special.  The bun though was waaayyy too much.  It was so dense, I had to remove half the bun barely into the meal.  It just masked all the meat on the burger.  The chips were an okay pairing, but they didn't seem fresh.  Great service, but for the price and quality I experienced, definitely wouldn't be back compared to other places in the airport.",

    "text": "Being a person who works in the service industry, I am usually pretty understanding and nice about these kinds of things, but this had to be shared. I often joke with coworkers about our \"worst service and dining experience ever\" and today I have a new number 1. After waiting in line for ~10-15min, we were seated by a host and given a couple menus (this was the highlight of our stay by the way). It took roughly 8 min after that to be greeted by our server Jimmy, who was only able to muster the phrase \"what you guys want?\" after approaching our table. Don't you feel the hospitality? I had a coffee, my brother had a sprite, and his wife has a coke. Pretty simple stuff. Jimmy also took our food order at the same time (since we had ample time to look at the menu before we were greeted). Both my brother and I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich and his wife ordered the breakfast enchiladas. Jimmy strolled to his POS and put our order in. Our drinks took roughly 15 min to get to us. My brother was given a coke, attempted to catch Jimmy's attention, but he was gone in a flash. The quickest I saw Jimmy move was when he was leaving the table. We even shared a laugh about how the food might come out before the drinks, but alas, everything in this restaurant moves slowly. When our food was delivered, I wasn't happy (but surely not shocked by this point in my stay) with the portion sizes. The waffles are only half of a waffle maker worth. Not to mention they were cold and rock hard. The chicken was very dry, fairly tough, and about 4oz in size. Two pieces. Most definitely don't order this if my review hasn't swayed you away and you are naive enough to even consider going here. My sister in law said that her food was great and just the right size for her (I'm being fair here). I never got a warm up or refill on coffee, and only one soda was refilled after everyone's plates had already been cleared. As we waited for the check, I watched the table next to us get delivered the food from another table, lots of empty drinks, and very few if any smiling faces. Heed my advice and never, for any reason, come to this place if you are in the Phoenix airport. And to anyone who gave a 5 star review, let me get a little bit of whatever you are smokin'.",

    "text": "I just had one of the worst customer service experiences of my foodie dining career. The server, Janet.... Or maybe Janice, a seemingly nice middle aged gal was sub par and did nothing to fix an easily fixable situation. In fact the head manager a tall thin man also seemed to not care about how customers were treated at all. The server was MIA most of the time, failed to fill my water twice and I had to remind her... Twice. And when she did fill the water glass it was only to 75% full. When I mentioned that she wasn't fully filling the glass, she filled my water glass to the exact same amount a walked away. Once I finished my meal I walked over to the to-go stand to look at dessert, since my server failed to ask if I wanted any. I ordered the pudding which was tossed into a blue \"McDonald's style\" water cup. I asked to have this item removed from the bill as this presentation was not logical to bring on a flight and not worth 7$. The manager came over aloof and disinterested in satisfying me as the customer. And just as I walked away from the to-go stand I see the server I had and then hear her chime loudly... \"Oh is that my shitty friend?!\". I was appalled. How does a manager hear this and do NOTHING. The food was wonderful as always and but the service (as a past server myself) was horrible. I did leave a $3 tip which was only $1 below 20% and now I'm wishing I left her nothing. The comment was more than inappropriate and I feel as though this is the only way to voice my concerns, as the manager behaved as though he could care less. I hope that things change in a positive way, because the food is so amazing and deserves great service to accompany it.",

First of all, five stars for the awesome airport food.  The Stetson Chopped Salad was fantastic.  The truffled mac'n cheese was light on the truffle ... but hell, it's airport food and there was more than enough bacon to get a pass.   However, I have to dock it two stars for the service.  The hostess couldn't be bothered to get us a table ... actually it did clearly bother her.  Our main server was busy but fine.  The person that brought out our food appeared nearly as annoyed with us for ordering food as the hostess was for our table request.  I don't expect the same quality service at the airport as the Old Town location (which is always great) but I  do expect decent service.  Hell, the McDonald's employees next door were all smiles.  Maybe management should send in a secret eater.  You may be surprised.  So yes, I will be back (as often as possible).  Hopefully I can update this to a five-star.",

The bruschetta was so so, but the other two were truly yummy. Perhaps most engaging was our waiter TJ. He welcomed us as if we had just arrived into his own kitchen.

I asked one of the helpful attendants walking around the airport where I should eat, and she pointed me to Cowboy Ciao with no hesitation. She said that on occassion, she and her husband drive out there just to go eat the scallops. (She works there, so I assume that that's cool).   Officially intrigued, I frolicked off to get the scallops. And they were awesome. They were crusted with some kind of nut (corn nuts? I think?), and served over a hearty risotto chock full of delicious veggies. Nothing on the menu looked boring. The guy next to me ate a burger topped with pulled pork, avocado, and a whole mess of other awesomeness, and declared that it was fantastic.   Way to go PHX, for stepping up your game for hungry travelers!",

Being fans of the Scottsdale restaurant and by convenience of being just feet away from our gate, my wife and I decided to grab a bite at Cowboy Ciao before boarding an overnight redeye from Phoenix to London.   I love the quesadilla del dia (of the day) concept.  Sure, it's probably the expiring stuff that they need to get rid of, but when folded into a tortilla with melted cheese, who knows any better.  I'm shocked mexican restaurants don't use this idea.  We also had a west coast wrap which was quite tasty.  The chips served with the sandwich were great.  Just a word of warning, Cowboy Ciao is pricey.  With tip and just water to drink, those two orders came to about $29, and they were probably the two cheapest items on the menu.  It's good food, especially for airport dining, but it will cost you.",

That's the way I'm seeing this Yelp page trending. It's like a summer blockbuster that, like, everybody and their mother has seen and -- gasp! -- you haven't made it to the theater yet. It's your patriotic duty to eat this friggin' salad, you corporate automaton. Why? Well, aside from it being a healthy antiserum for those cocktails you consumed during the conference, it's likely the tastiest airport food you'll ever encounter. They nail the consistency of the salmon, too; not dry, but not so pink and fleshy that you tremble. Israeli couscous and pupitas? Wow. Put this one on the company credit card, those bastards owe you this bonus.   And yeah, I'll agree with the other critics, the service was so friendly and efficient, what a cast.

He called me, and every other woman he waited on, \"Hon\".   How disrespectful.  When my salad didn't come with everything that was supposed to come on it I tried to get his attention three times and was completely ignored. He was passing the table and I tapped his arm and said \"excuse me\".  Totally ignored me.  I got up and left.  He told me I could have my bill and I walked away.  He threatened someone would come after me for it .  Expressed my frustration to the poor kid at the host stand.  Who hires these people?!  They're the ones who ought to be fired.",

    "text": "Ok, I don't normally sit down at a computer to write a five star review for an airport restaurant. I'm generally lucky if I remember what I ate at an airport, much less to Yelp about it.   That being said, the Stetson Salad I had at Cowboy Ciao has me hoping for a layover in Phoenix next time I travel out west!  The over-the-top friendly server told me this would be an all-time salad to try, and after a week of eating, well, NOT salads, I figured it couldn't hurt.   They promptly brought it out for me, and it was not like any salad I'd had before. Each ingredient was set in its own line: roasted dry sweet corn, pupitas, arugula, Israeli cous-cous, bruschetta tomatoes and I added chicken.  I don't know if it was my body ravenously craving real ingredients after a week of debauchery, but this salad hit the damn spot! I couldn't eaten two of them.  Anyhow, I can't attest to one other thing on the menu but I highly recommend you order this. I may even try to make something similar to re-create it one of these days.",

Anyways, pricing aside, stopped in here for lunch before our flight and the menu options looked decent, the Chicken and Waffles called out my name.  I'm not one for mustard slaw, so I opted for chips with my Chicken and \"Red velvet\" waffles with Bourbon Butter Whip Cream and Syrup.... Sounds amazing right?  Nope, try again.  The chicken was good, I'll give it that...  Boneless fried chicken on teeny tiny waffles...  Basically, the two pieces of chicken sit on two quarter pieces of a Belgian waffle.  And the \"Red velvet waffles\" would have no flavor if it were not for the chicken.  Plainer than a regular waffle, the \"Bourbon Butter Whip Cream\" offered no sort of additional flavor.  Thank goodness for the syrup which made everything edible.  The chips unfortunately were NOT edible. I'm all for natural potatoes, different textures, flavors, varieties, etc, but these chips had absolutely NO flavor.  Tasted like the potatoes were fried up a week ago, they were cooled and left to dry up.  Super hard, not even a flavoring of oil or anything. I couldn't eat them.  Luckily my traveling mate had 4 pretty strong drinks and thought they were heavenly.  haha!  Power to the vodka, eh?!",

When we said we had to be at our gate in 10 minutes to begin boarding, our server boxed up our quesadilla without us even asking, which was very helpful.  -The food was very good- we got two appetizer quesadillas and one member in our party got the mixed green salad. The salsa served with the quesadilla was fresh and flavorful, and the quesadilla itself was quite good.   Cons: -Not-so-great prices. 1/2 a medium/large quesadilla cut into four slices was $14. To be fair, it's an airport restaurant, but even so, it was pretty small for those standards, which was why we ordered two.  -Loud atmosphere: I realized just how loud it was after walking out.   Final take: Yes, I would probably come here again if ever in the Phoenix airport, because the food was really good.",

I ordered a chopped salad w/avocado as the protein (neat!) - interesting chopped - arugula, pumpkin seeds, craisins, dried corn, pico de gallo, and couscous. Loved the dried corn (nice texture) and pumpkin seeds, pesto buttermilk ranch dressing rocked, wish there was a lot more arugula (barely any greens in this salad), and thought the pico had a funky taste so didn't eat.

However, not much under $15, so if you are concerned about cost in the airport, this wouldn't be the best. I wanted a sit down place where I could drink and eat before my flight was delayed. Definitely over-priced for what it is, but that's life in an airport. If it cost this much outside an airport, I wouldn't be dining here, but pickings are slim for anything non-fast food in an airport.  I ordered the breakfast enchiladas. The only issue was the eggs were runny, but some of the white was not cooked. I prefer over easy eggs, so they weren't prepared well. However, I easily pushed the uncooked white to the side and was able to eat the rest without issue.  The chorizo wasn't super spicy but still tasted good. The drink menu was typical of an airport, so I had a cider since I didn't want to spend $13 on a cocktail. The service was also excellent. The waiter was very attentive, and the host chatted with me between customers since I was on my own waiting for my flight.  I've been to plenty of restaurants in airports and the food still sucks, since you're trapped in the airport. While they have the same prices, I liked the food and would be happy to go back if I was waiting in Terminal 4 again.",

When he first mentioned this place, I thought Cowboy Chow, not Ciao, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I had a lunch portion of scallops over some risotto, brown, with an added twist on this.  The scallops were very tasty, a bit firm, but still great, I also had a craft beer, housed in bourbon barrel, great.  My friend had a turkey sandwich, but it had grilled red peppers, cucumbers, excellent, and the very thin homemade fries, great.

Then after ~40 minutes we finally got our appetizer which was made incorrectly (I'm allergic to beans and told the server this, however the dish came covered in beans. They took it back and you guessed it 20 minutes later it finally came out (our appetizer was literally fries). We never got to eat our actual meals in the restarting as the service was so slow and poor that we ran out of time and had to get our food boxed to go. The only reason there are two stars here is because the manager at least wasn't awful just the wait staff. We also paid $14 for a chop salad and if you look at the picture, it is about what you expect of a side salad not an entree. Overall very dissatisfied with our experience and it is a disgrace that this place calls itself Cowboy Ciao as the OG Cowboy Ciao was a True institution of Phoenix dining.",

    "text": "Fine for an airport restaurant. Good service, though!  Limited menu, but with options that cover most special diets and food allergies. I had a tough time choosing from the small menu. Lamont of the foods are \"heavy\" - not something I want to eat before a long flight. There were some salad options.  Huge wine menu and a full bar. Probably a good spot for a few pre-flight drinks.   Food was slow coming out, but it worked out fine for our flight/boarding timing (we were NOT there during a rush). It's very cramped with so many people's carry-on luggage all over the place. I think the staff could do a better job asking people to please put their luggage under their table or seat. It was very difficult to get from the entry to our table and back again, and I wasn't pulling luggage - I just had a big purse.   Service was good -- A+ for that!  7/10ish. Would probably go back if I find myself in this terminal again.",

    "text": "It is a restaurant in a airport.  Let's start there.  You can't have too high of expectations.  We ate here twice.  Once on the way out and once on our way home.  Basically, this was the closest sit down restaurant to our gates.  We had my 82 year old father with us and walking around is not an option.  Staff is friendly, if not trying to do a hard sale. They get where they are and try to get you in and out. Both times my husband ordered the breakfast enchiladas and loved them.  So much so that my dad got them on the second visit.  I got a Stetson Chopped salad the first visit based on the waiter's recommendation which was so so. I then got the quesadilla on return trip.  It was better.  My husband enjoyed their SleepyDog Tail Chaser IPA.  Prices were not terrible for being an airport.  Maybe a dollar more per entree.  I believe they have a location not in the airport in Phoenix as well.  The way out the waiter was nice enough to let us chill for longer than we should without giving us attitude.  We had about a four hour layover.  Over all an ok place.  I wish food options were healthier.  However, nice to have a sit down option at all vs. typical fast food you usually can get in an airport.",

You can get beef, chicken or salmon. Last time I checked, PHX is a ways from the ocean even if it is an airport. So, I went with the chicken. Very nice! Well seasoned, so I didn't use more than half the accompanying dressing. Expensive for what it is($14.25) but average pricing for an airport.   The salad had chicken, corn, arugula, pumpkin or squash seeds, and other chopped up stuff. Best to check out the photo I uploaded with this review.   In the end, especially with the quick and courteous service, I decided this is a place to remember positively at PHX, which has not been a happy food hunting ground for me the other 100 or so times I've been there.",

With this kind of enthusiasm, I went for it, and I wasn't disappointed.   Smoked salmon, crunchy pepitas, coucous, dried currants, peppery arugula, sweet corn, juicy tomatoes came out with a side of buttermilk dressing. As I was about to stir it up, my server offered to do this for me, which seemed so formal in such an unformal setting, but I appreciated the gesture. The mixture was perfectly balanced and fresh, and I felt full without feeling guilty. Plus, I am a sucker for smoked salmon.  Would definitely return if I'm ever in this airport again, just for this salad. It was a hard choice considering the fact that there are actually quite a few restaurants in this airport that are rated highly on Yelp.",

    "text": "After a long day in airports -- and a pretty bad meal at a place in Mexico -- it was refreshing to have a decent meal here at AZ's airport! We were really close to choosing McD's when an airport working suggested we try Cowboy Caio, and I'm so glad we did.  We had the open-faced steak sandwich, which was well flavored and cooked just the way I like it (med rare) atop a nicely grilled and buttered piece of bread. It came with kettle chips drizzled in bleu cheese, but because I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese, the waiter suggested I dip them in this pesto aioli that was yum! We also had a shared plate under the heading \"Grazing\" that turned out to be a huge dish. It was a green chile pappardelle concoction that sounded kinda weird at first but was surprisingly delicious. It kind of reminded me of tuna casserole... but in a good way if you can image that. The wine, beer and Bloody Mary list was pretty impressive, though they seemed to be running low on the white wine selections when we came in. All in all, I really enjoyed it and was happy to find it in the mess that can be airport food.",

But the amount also looked rather puny. Better to order from the togo menu or try your luck somewhere else. 4 stars because it did taste good and it was clean and fast service.

    "text": "This place is wonderful!! Finding a yummy and relaxing and welcoming place in an airport is usually a fruitless exercise. But... If you are in the Phoenix airport for a long-ish layover, make your way over to Terminal 4, and the B concourse. Right by gate B22, you will find a place with delightful options, both in food and drink, and also delightful people. The staff is attentive, courteous and engaging, without invading your space. My husband and I are both vegetarians, so options were limited, but the Burrata Insalata salad was unreal (see pic). Buffalo Mozzarella, arugula, grape tomatoes and a huge helping of avocado topped with a few fried shallots--as I said, UN REAL. Price-wise, for a sit-down slice of heaven in an airport, $11 is hard to beat for a delicious and filling salad. I also had a glass of wine (zin from chronic cellars) that was delicious and about $8. You will do yourself a favor if you head over there. It helped put a bad previous flight experience and a long layover out of my head. Enjoy!!",

I've never heard of this place before until I was in Phoenix on a stop over last week.   It's turns out it's a chain.  When I looked at the menu I was a little skeptical about spending $14 for a filet steak sandwich especially with $4 hamburger just down the hall but I decided to try it anyway.  I may must say I was really impressed.  This place is not just good for an airport, it's on par with upscale places anywhere. The quality of the food, the temperature and presentation were all top notch.  The only thing I would suggest is when you offer someone a glass of Cabernet tell them it's $13.  Other than that I have no complaints and look forward to me next stopover.",

Luckily the Cowboy Ciao restaurant was close to my terminal. It's  cute, nice music, nice ambiance. I'm stuck between 3 or 4 stars, but there's more factors pushing me to 3 than 4 so far,....   The hostess who greeted me was very sweet, and for any business traveler used to being scoffed at, when asking for a seat by an outlet, this was a refreshing change. the entire bench seating of about 7 tables, has one outlet per table on the bench seat    The waitress was less than friendly, and for some reason reccomended bottled water because she won't drink the tap water here ..... I drink tap water even in most latin american countries over my last 10 years of travel, so maybe she's just looking for a higher check charge - therefore higher tip?      Anyway, it's cute, clean. Food came quick. Although it appears they're going for a guormet spot to replace a reportedly horrible place (according to the story on the menu). for example on a layover i'm not usually going to splurge $17.50 for a basic salid nor $17.50 for a steak sandwich as i eathalf while running to board a plane....    i did find a decent compromise on the \"Truffled 'Mac n' Cheese'\" appetizer. It's not the best new spin on mac n' cheese, i've had in the last few years, but it's good. Very decent size for a $7.50 appetizer,   Wine by the glass list isn't too bad either - which for ME personally, can make a or break a place LOL :)    Anyway, overall i'd probably give 3.5 Stars, but i'm still here....so let's see how this story ends :)",

The hostess was sweet. We opted to sit at the bar, as it was very crowded. After being ignored by the bartender, my husband got up to ask the hostess if we could sit at a recently vacated table. She obliged, just in time too, because after her got up, one of the bartenders left the beer tap on directly in front of his seat and beer started to over flow on to the rail and on to my Husbands phone. I caught it in time.  At the table, and our server was Jake. He was pretty awkward. Husband ordered the chicken wrap, I ordered Testosterone salad and we split a mac and cheese. Jake turned around before I could tell him how I wanted my steak cooked. Husband ended up liking his wrap. Chips were good. The Mac and cheese was ok. But my steak was borderline still mooing. I sent it back and got the green side salad. Turns out I don't like blue cheese. Or maybe I don't like how much of it was in the salad. Either way, not impressed. My water glass went empty for he second half of the entire meal. And my husbands coke was only filled when the hostess (yes, not the server) asked me if I wanted to send back the salad, then she took my replacement order.  Go to McDonalds instead....I feel like I say that a lot. And I haven't been to McDs in yrs...so take that for what it's worth. Ha",
