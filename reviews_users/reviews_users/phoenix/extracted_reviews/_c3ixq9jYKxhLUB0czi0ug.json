We have been here before and had very pleasant experiences however, this time, was different.  There were 9 people in our party, 5 of whom were children.  As soon as we walked in, the attitude was one of dismay because we had small children with us.  The man who served us, I believe his name was Gregory, was very rude and tried moving us;  first to an isolated high top table which would not have worked for our children and grandchildren and when we said we would move to the booth near the bathroom so that we did not disturb other diners, he tried moving us outside!!!  Very rude and still we stayed and spent over $150.00 there!  We should have left and spent our hard-earned money elsewhere...somewhere where we felt comfortable.  I will never go to this place again which is sad because the food was good but we were made to feel unwanted.  I called Management when we left but he seemed very disinterested and unconcerned.",

    "text": "As if trapped in a bad cowboy movie, I bellied up to the bar at The Original Hamburger Works and couldn't help but think, what have I gotten myself into?  Country music was playing on the jukebox, and it was a little unnerving to overhear a conversation between other patrons about a bar fight.  Then the buxom bartender said \"hi\" and something in her voice was genuine and welcoming and her smile could have brightened a room. Pouring a pitcher of beer from the tap, then setting an ice-cold glass in front of me, she offered up a menu.  While the 30-year-old eatery in Phoenix is showing its age, the attitude is laid back and super friendly.  The Original Hamburger Works has two dining rooms, the bar and a more family-friendly space. The taste is decidedly kitschy, with walls covered in vintage signs, sporting memorabilia and chotchkies galore. The atmosphere is fun. Large tables can accommodate big groups. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter. In the bar, orders are taken by the bartender.  Like a campfire, there is something mouthwatering about the strong smell of mesquite wood smoke emanating from the kitchen. You can tell from watching the cooks manhandle slabs of meat over an open flame that the burgers here are treated right.  The centerpiece of the dining room is a wagon filled with fresh-sliced tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickles and condiments and salad dressings. You are in control of your burger destiny with as many ladles of ranch dressing as you'd like. I'd recommend not going too heavy on the condiments and toppings; the burgers here can stand on their own.  Biting into the Big One ($4.09) gives new meaning to the whimsical saying. A deep amber charbroiled crust surrounds the 1/3 pound of fresh ground beef, inside it's perfectly medium, as ordered. The meat is toothsome, well seasoned and bursting with a wonderful beefy caramelized flavor.  Potatoes, aka fries ($1.79), were disappointingly pale and seemingly unsalted. I'd opt for the Onion Rings ($2.69), fried golden brown and addictive with dunks into ranch dressing.  If you don't eat red meat you're in luck, they make a juicy Chicken Sandwich ($5.09). Cooked over the same mesquite coals, this sandwich has a surprising amount of satisfying heft. The Italian version gets a treatment of flavor, adding Italian dressing before getting cooked to a savory finish.  Fair warning: When eating Buffalo Wings (nine pieces for $5.95) don't wear a nice shirt. These are so sloppy that you may need a stack of wet-naps to get through the plate, but exactly how they should be.  The Original Hamburger Works might be a little bit country, but the burgers are a whole lot of rock 'n roll.",

Flavorful and topped with many different types of burgers - teriyaki, western, Big One - all sorts of choices.  Get some homemade fries and onion rings to complement that tasty burger.  Now, to wash it down they have one of those high tech fancy schmancy Coke dispenser and it is fun.  I like getting the Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero.  It is fun and they usually have some local sports on and they have a full bar where you can have an adult beverage with your burger.  The staff is always courteous and the food is really good.  We go by here whenever we want to have a good meaty burger that is local and part of the community.",

    "text": "Completely running into this place by accident, without the aid of friends or yelp reviews, I am overwhelmingly pleased that I not only found a place I enjoyed that night, but for many occasions to come.   I wasn't really sure what to expect when I walked in, and at first I was overwhelmed. It seemed like a neverending lot of treasures to discover. There were old signs all over the walls, stop lights, the ads in the glass on the tables, a wagon full of 'fixins for everyone to add to their meal.  As I eyed the menu and gazed upon the rest of the establishment, there were a few tables occupied with an older group of friends and a young boy with his dad. There were also a few people at the bar, which I spotted in the other room as I finalized my decision. While I waited, I ordered a coke and loved that they had the digital you can do anything you want with your soda machine. Total win! I think I sat and played with it for minutes. Luckily there wasn't a line.   Overall the place has a nice relaxing feel in my opinion. It may look like it should be dirty, but I assure you its not. There's a huge part of the restaurant that is not near the bar for the family folk. Outside the bar is a patio that apparently has horseshoes. Oh yes, you heard me right. Who's coming with me to play horseshoes?  I ordered the green chili burger and it was amazing. Lids are offered for the plastic condiment cups at the 'fixins bar for those who are ordering to go, like I was.  Looks like a potential nice place to sit back and watch a game... or play horseshoes... :)",

Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.  The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.  The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure!

My husband and I have tried,  wings,  grilled chicken sandwich,  fish and chips,  grilled fish sandwich,  veggie Burger, salad bar and various soups.  All of it is delicious and worth trying.  I think the \"chuck wagon\" style condiment set up is the best you put what and how much on your Burger/ sandwich that you desire.  Personally I put minimal toppings (I don't want to hide any of that delicious mesquite flavor).    Go start  a family tradition today at the Original Hamburger Works(you won't regret it and will feel great supporting a local business.)",

The only thing I was dissapointed with was that my onion bun was flatter than a crepe and the wait time was a little longer than normal.  Overall, if you are looking for a Phoenix icon to eat at that is a neighborhood classic this is that place. The beer is always cold and the staff is very friendly.  If you get bored, you can go outside tonthe back patio and play a little pong with a beer or soda within arms reach.  Great place to unwind and relax, watch sports, listen to jukebox and engage in conversation.",

    "text": "We just happened on this place the other day. It is a little out of my normal stomping grounds. When there are hamburger joints all over the place - both fast food & local neighborhood places - it takes a really good burger to make you want to return to a specific place when gas is expensive & time is short.  Would I go back? Food was definitely good enough. Not gourmet, but a good \"home-cooked\" tasting burger. Best part about mine is that I ordered it with green chile on it. (Remember I am from the Land of Enchantment?) Instead of coming with canned chopped chile, it came with a nice big slice of real roasted green chile. I ordered it \"mild-hot\" and it was perfect. Tasty, without covering up the burger flavor. These folks definitely know the difference between chile & chili. Family must be from New Mexico?  Oh, yeah, i scarfed every last crumb of that green chile cheeseburger! And now I'm craving another one. Guess where I'm going today?",

I didn't order the salad bar, but as I was choosing my condiments I noticed how unpleasant that looked as well. The $75 I spent was not worth it.",

Burger was pretty good size,  i dont think theres a need for double or bigger than the Big One. I added bacon and I appreciate its in round shape so it covers more bites than strip bacon. Fries were good as well. Onion rings could be skipped nothing special. We also ordered a side of chili i would skip it too.   If you know Anthony Bourdains top 3 burger joint in the word named Sams in San Fran then you could compare the flavors and feel. This reminded me of that place. I highly recommend it.",

Yep. That happened.  The decor is retro and super cute. Lots of old school signs which I snagged a few photos of. (Just not the food!) The outdoor patio seems pretty nice but my review is only of the indoor bar area. We wanted to watch some of the sporting events going on.  I tried something on the adventurous side called a \"Hawaiian Burger\". This is a slice of pineapple with teriyaki and provolone cheese. Such an interesting mix of flavors! I'm definitely a fan!   And then (oh boy!) I wedged in slices of jalapenos, tomatoes, lettuce (ok, that's not cutting edge) and a smattering of mayo. This totally worked for me. I love jalapenos. (I can't possibly imagine having a 1/2 lb burger. 1/3lb burger seemed more than enough!)  I was tickled pink that there's a little condiment wagon you can help yourself to. Even tho it was evening everything on the wagon was super fresh. (No wilted lettuce for me!) Also, it's worth noting the fries are crunchy and not at all on the soggy side. (I snagged one from my fella. Delish!)   Evening crowd seemed to consist of local area folks. I'm told clientele during the day is more of office and hospital employees. This place is super kid friendly. The kids really seemed to get a kick out of the soda machine. (Where you press a button and different soda streams out.)  We were checked on a number of times by employees, even though we were not sitting anywhere near the bar. Gotta love great customer service!",

I witness the guy replenishing the bar but putting the old ketchup on top of the new ketchup. The problem with this is that the old ketchup had lettuce and pepper pieces in it.

We waited a good 30-45 minutes when we noticed the 2 other people got their food before us. The issue with this is that the waitress/bartender wasn't busy and knows her customers (or should know).  We called her over (after 30-45 min) and asked where our food was.  She left to find out and came back and said she never put the order through.  She said she'd get that taken care of.  My husband and I asked to pay for our cokes and that we were leaving.  She gave us the drinks for free (she better!!!) and we left.

The first thing you may notice is the \"Retirement Burger,\" with a price tag of a cool million bucks, and it includes the burger, a drink, and the restaurant. A cheap joke, or kinda funny? You be the judge, but I've caught myself chuckling at it before.   On top of that, the burgers here are rad. Yeah . . . rad. They cook them right in front of you while you wait and they have an entire table with condiments like fresh lettuce,  tomatoes, sweet relish and a few other goodies to complete your masterpiece according to your preferences. It's like a waaayyy less corporate Fuddrucker's. While you wait for your burger to cook up, I recommend an order of the 50/50 zucchini and mushroom appetizer to get you through.   I bought a Powerball ticket this week. If things go well, maybe I'll get the Retirement Burger.",

The fixins bar is also outstanding, of course I am the kind of slob who tries to put 12 slices of tomato on his burger, so take that for what it's worth.  In addition, they have Super Mario Brothers of 8-bit Nintendo fame which you can play for a quarter while you wait for your burger.  I once made it to Level 8 before my burger was ready which says a lot more about my hours wasted playing Nintendo than their service, as the burgers always come up pretty quick.  Great place, highly recommended.",

    "text": "Well it has been about three weeks since I made the choice to visit this shrine to all that is burger, and I wanted to share my experience. I was online looking through reviews for other burger places when I found this place. I noticed that the reviews seemed pretty good so I decided to check it out.   So on a Friday afternoon my buddy and I walked in to this old school looking building searching for what I was hoping was going to be one tasty burger ( think Samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction) and I was right! The burgers are a nice size given some of the prices (7 bucks for a burger)?    My tasty burger featured American cheese and a well done patty that looked like someone had made it at their house. Large disk shaped patty grilled the way I like it and ready for the several toppings I would choose to add from their topping bar. That 's right they have a section set up where you decide what you want to add to your sandwich. Cool, huh? OK so now that the good stuff has been said let 's get to the bad.   First as the saying goes all that glitters is not gold was talking about this place. From the old looking tables that featured chairs that looked like they where taken from the set of Roseann, to the small and expensive order of fries I received there where some areas that needed improvement asap. The lady taking our order was not the most friendly person you will ever meet and the bar section was to close to the dinning room section so you get the full effect of being a loud drinker without having to pay 4-5 bucks for a beer.   Also some of the decorations looked kind of dusty like they where kept outside during the last dust storm. So if you want good burgers then this is a good place for that. But if you want a cool hangout spot you may want to pop in a DVD of cheers and grab that burger to go.",

The burger was a little over done compared to my request and the staff could have been a little nicer.   With all the seemingly negative comments, it could very easily be one of the best flavored burgers I have had. The smoke taste was in every bite, the meat was quality and tasted fresh, the self serve condiment bar was a plus, the red cream soda was a nice surprise. The frys were frys, a little crispy and perfect.   I will be back and I will get the 1/2lb with extra cheese. I am sure I will be re-rating to a 5 if the staff steps it up too.",

There is a choice of about 6 different style burgers to choose from cooked to order on a wood fired grill.  If you want a cheeseburger, there are 3 or 4 different cheeses to choose from.  I love the fact that there is a condiment bar where you are free to pile on as much stuff as you want, hello pickles, hello mustard, hello mayo, hello tomatoes.  You even get your choice of white or whole wheat bun!  The soda fountain features some unique choices including red pop, and there is a good selection of sides that you can order  including chili cheese fries.  The decor is all Old West and I fully expected to hear a lady in a cowboy shirt and a 10 gallon hat ring a triangle to let us know our food was ready.  Seating is ample.  OHW is unfortunately just another burger joint with nothing special warranting more than 3 or 3.5 stars, but it's a consistent meal at a fair price.",

Since I was told burgers were what they were know for, that's what I got. I did the burger lunch special with fries. White, Wheat or Onion was the 1st question asked, followed by the type of cheese. My \"no bun\" request seemed like something that they didn't get a lot of? We got there around 11:30, and they seemed to very quickly get busy. Waited a bit for our food, but what came out was hot and fresh. I loved the fixings bar. Lots of fresh items for you to dress your order. I would have liked to see leaf lettuce instead of shred, but just meant I asked for a fork and knife to eat my burger. I prefer my burger naked in lettuce rather than with a bun. One co-worker ordered their veggie burger, and she said that it was also tasty. I'm not a huge burger fan, but when I want one there is just something about a grilled one that is so much better. =) Come hungry!",

My sister just recently discovered this place through a co-worker and has been bugging me to go with her ever since.  I was really surprised at how big the space is inside, tons of seating, a bar area and even an outdoor patio with tables and games!  Although I haven't been since I was a kid, I am guessing this is similar to the Chuckbox, order at the counter, and then they call out your number.  After you grab your burger, you head over to a giant wooden wagon that serves as the condiment bar.  It is stocked with tomatoes, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, mustard, mayo...you name it.  One side of it serves as a salad bar, so I guess if you went there and just got salad you consider it a healthy restaurant.  Their main gig is burgers, and they come in a variety of sizes from 1/3 lb all the up to a full pound and with a variety of toppings.  They also have some chicken sandwiches and even a grilled fish sandwich on the menu!  The burger was pretty good, the cheese was melted and I liked that I got to top it off just the way I like it.  But I have to say my favorite thing was the Fried Zucchini and Onion Rings.  I know most things are good once they are fried, but the batter on these was just right, and they were crisp, not a soggy mess.  I scored myself some ranch dressing off of the salad bar and I was in deep fried heaven.  So, while I won't be visiting here every week, every now and then I can see it hitting the spot.",

We were a bit confused walking in on where we would go to order but made our way up to the first register. Complete lack of customer service or greeting by the young lady that took our order even though it was apparent it was our first time in. She did not let us know we would round the corner to pay and pick up our food. I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and we both got fries. They have a great condiment spread laid out to customize our sandwiches and received our order within about 5-8 minutes of placing our order. We both really enjoyed the food, my burger tasted like it was off the grill in a backyard bbq, which I really liked. My husband was not a huge fan of the \"frank's red hot\" sauce on the sandwich but the chicken was juicy and the portion was large. We came back a week later and sat in the bar. Similarly lackluster customer service experience in the restaurant and in the bar, My husband ordered a hot dog which came butterflied. I ordered the burger again and it was just as tasty as I remembered.

It's not the fanciest or stylish or even cleanest burger spot for sure but that's the best part!!! The salad bar for your burger choice takes it to the top!!!! Plenty of options and even a bar if that's the type of burger eating vibe you want!!! Thx for staying True and the same!!!",

The chicken sandwiches and burgers are no longer consistent. When you order it's a coin-flip whether you get a great sandwich or a freeze dried specimen ready for space exploration.  Besides your server taking the time to explain you will be charged $.50 for requesting ranch dressing unless you self serve... The worst part about The Original Hamburgerworks is any given order of 10 wings will feature two to three broken ones. What a tasty thought... A broken, exposed bone chicken wing or three to wrap your mouth around.  Avoid this place unless you're desperate. Or being held hostage.",

    "text": "tl;dr--dude, it's a large, edible burger place with a dive bar attached. Anyone who eats meat will survive settling here, or at least drink until they enjoy it. Oh, and portions are gigantic.   It's alright to me, but how much you like it all depends on your burger philosophy, a key portion of your path to self-realization. Let me explain.  Places like OHW make it incredibly difficult for me to evaluate what a good burger is. I feel like we're hitting this beefy new paradigm in which we have all these old-school, no-frills, blue-collar, gruff, and rustic little restaurants, but they're endangered. You know, the tough ones that have been around for like 40 years? The ones where you wouldn't be surprised to find sawdust in your food? Well that's this. And it's ugly on the outside and on a corner that no one cares about, but the people are humble and it if you squint hard, it kinda feels like someone's house. Don't ask for a custom order, go to the cart of condiments and do it yourself. If that sounds appetizing, go for it. Can't go wrong with the wings either, which are spicy and generous to the point I can forgive them needing a bit more sauce. Also, I got a bit buzzed here. It's cool that you can do that, but honestly it's weird with so many families running around. 5 o'clock HH crowd was abundant, but TBH I don't wanna hear or see third graders running around.  Back to burgers.   Anyway...I understand times are changing. If you like 'modern' burgers, you won't like this place. If you like the high-traffic, high-rent plazas and bright lights and gaudy, uniformed staff and exotic cheeses and maaaaybe a craft beer. If you like places that let you order in advance online, or even maintain a functional website, OHW is the antithesis to that and you'll have no shortage of alternatives. You will honestly hate this and want to go away to a place that has Wi-Fi and doesn't make you feel delicate.   So there you go. Find out which kind of burger person you are and achieve your carnivorous nirvana.",

I had the 1/3 lb bacon cheeseburger (jalapeno cheese) and hubby had the ham steak & fries combo. Everything was delicious. The condiment bar was beyond fresh. The best part? The pickles were nice and cold (which is a big plus in my book...I'm picky about my pickles).   So you order on the food side, give them your name and then go sit on the (dive) bar side and get your brews and cocktails. This was definitely the best burger I've had in a long time...maybe ever. Be patient, it's definitely worth the wait for a made to order sammich. Nom!!",

    "text": "The Original Hamburger Works is an authentic, rustic Arizona treasure. I am going to address some of the negative reviews I read here within my review.  Firstly, if you're expecting fine dining and to be waited on hand-and-foot, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!. This is a classic, cowboy-style establishment. That means, apart from cooking the food, YOU do everything yourself, the way YOU like it. No one will get in your way or tell you that you're doing it wrong or that you don't fit in. This is not a fad, nor is it a corporate-owned, soulless entity that employs big breasted women and other shallow gimmicks to trick you into eating here.  The Original Hamburger Works has been in business since 1977 and has only stayed in business this long, in the same location, because it generates enough income on a sustainable and regular basis to justify its very existence since it opened more than 38 years ago! NOT because it has some rich financial or corporate investors. This is the real deal that proves it has passed the test of time that kills the vast majority of independent restaurants within the first few years.  I'm a very fussy eater, but I've never tasted anything here I didn't like. I have no idea how the fried foods (french fries, onion rings, breaded mushrooms, etc...) don't come out greasy. I have no idea how the hamburgers melt in your mouth, even plain, with nothing on them!  The ordering process is, again, cowboy-style. A style you likely won't find any place else. You walk up to the counter, located below the large menu mounted on the wall, and place your order with the cooks. They give you a printed copy of your order and then you walk to the cashier, just around the corner to the left. She looks at the printed order, rings it up and you pay her. She asks for your name and gives you cups for any sodas ordered.  Next, fill your sodas/tea/water however you like. After that, find a table and seat yourself. There are free peanuts (in the shell) and popcorn by the bar - help yourself.   Your name will be called out when your order is ready. This typically takes less than 15 minutes (in my experience). Your food is waiting for you by the cashier, on disposable plates, on a large silver platter. Bring the platter to your table, and when you're ready (and if you ordered a burger) take your burger to the burger-bar and top it with whatever you like, as much as you like, just the way you, and ONLY you, know how you like it.  Go back to your table, enjoy your meal and, when done, throw everything away except for plastic baskets and the silver platter. Set those above the garbage can.  This place is very down-to-earth. The prices are great and the food is terrific. The staff are busy working, so you often won't have much (or any) conversation with them apart from the ordering and paying process. If previous customers leave without cleaning up after themselves, they're the ignorant, inconsiderate, self-entitled jerks to blame, NOT the staff. However, the staff *WILL* clean the tables if they notice or you ask (whichever comes first). We've all been to fast food restaurants where slob, inconsiderate cretins pretending to be human beings, leave their mess for the others to clean up. Some 'people' are just inconsiderate pigs and shouldn't eat out at fast food restaurants where YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF! (Did I put enough emphasis on consideration?)  Half of the building is the restaurant and the other half a bar. Sit where you are most comfortable. Its interesting to note that the booths by the bar have salt and pepper shakers, but other booths in the restaurant do not. There are salt and pepper shakers at the burger bar. Once again, help yourself. Put it back where you found it when you're done.  When you understand the social contract involved with eating here, you'll realize how much you enjoy it is directly related to how much you WANT to enjoy it. The employees are not there to entertain you.   You should certainly feel safe while dining here as you'll often see Phoenix police officers dining here regularly.  I honestly believe if you choose to dine here with the right attitude and expectations, you'll enjoy it as much (or more) than my family does. We've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food in the 4-5 years we've been dining here - and if we did, we understand mistakes sometimes happen and would address those issues accordingly. These are human beings working here, not robots. Treat others as you would like others to treat you. I admit, we do not eat here often enough! It seems like every time we finish a meal here, I ask my wife why its been so long since we were last here. I only wish I had known about it 30 years ago!",

While it isn't the most upscale place you can go to (you bus your own table as the majority of staff is paid to cook the food), it is by far worth the extra effort of bussing your own table and the price is just right. For about the same amount as you can pick up those flimsy, tasteless burgers at a fast food drive-thru you can get a nice, fresh, juicy burger and fries that will actually fill you up and leave you satisfied.",

Okay, the burger wasn't that good, very dry and really flavorless. Maybe that's why they have the fixing bar to add something to this burger. The service was as exciting as our burgers and made numerous mistakes and really didn't care that they did. I don't want to waste much time on this review, but I will say one positive thing. This place is very affordable and would probably be a good place to bring the kids. My review reflects my feelings of this burger joint. Blahhhhh",

So I ordered the Big Hamburger with fries. After waiting for like 20 minutes (worth it), they called my name. The food smelled great. Like Chuckbox, there is the toppings bar. So I got my toppings and all that stuff. Time to eat.   So upon taking a bite into this burger, it was good. Great! Not Chuckbox great, but still better than like In-N-Out or something. The burger was juicy, the bun was soft and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sounds like a commercial, right? Because it looked that good and tasted how it looked which is usually not the case for food when advertised.   Anyways, this is a place that I would come back if I was in the area or visiting any of my homies from the west side. Other than that, I can get Chuckbox. But this place is worth a try at least.   :)",

The Original Hamburger Works offers a condiment wagon filled with various burger fixens.  The condiments bar is a nice addition because your simply given your flame grilled burger and bun and the rest is up to you.  So be prepared to pile on the \"fixins\" at no extra charge.

They have a similar place in Tempe, but when you're not in the mood to go to the East Valley, come here. Cooked to order, fresh toppings bar, unlimited refills, bar to sit and watch games and get alcoholic beverages ... and an outdoor area.  Definitely not a disappointment; and they give you enough you don't need 2 combos ... 1 combo and 1 sandwich is MORE then enough!",

Went there for the first time yesterday for an early dinner with friends.  Love the \"shabby\" decor - the ancient cig machine by the front door was bitchen.    The burger was great - although Chuckbox is a wee bit better, in my opinion.  You can taste the smoke on the meat better at Chuckbox.  Plus CB has this excellent hot sauce... OHW just had Tabasco.    We didn't enjoy the outside accomodations but they looked really nice - patio seating, games, etc.  It was just too cold yesterday.  The bar was separate so it's definately a kid-friendly place.  We decided to get a milkshake after my friend's little boys came back with one that was so dark and chocolatey looking.  Never seen one so chocolatey looking!  I was shocked at the price ($5.41!!!!) but have to say (and my husband agreed) that it was well worth it.  Definately the BEST chocolate milkshake I've ever had.  And worth the $5+ pricetag.",

    "text": "One day me and the sis and the cuz were wondering around central phoenix like we usually do... not knowing where to go, I was feeling Pizza A Metro, but the cuz wanted a burger she could sink her teeth into... I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, \"ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!\" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*  She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...  It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!  We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there!   Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's True!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(  We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too!   When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!  my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!  But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!  To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose... (like I did) cuz they just MIGHT! but BOOO!!! They took me out to their truck instead of getting out of their trunks!!",

This place is like a local Fuddrucker's sans the awesome Fuddrucker's condiment bar and quality burgers. Instead there is a a bare bones selection of toppings with only ketchup, mustard, and some A-1 to sauce your bad-memorial-day-BBQ-esque burger. Taking a bite of burger here, you would swear your idiot cousin Ricky who thinks he knows everything about grilling, but could screw up boiling a hot dog, is manning the grill.   The food here would give this place only 2 stars, but it has its benefits. Its a cheap place to get something to eat when you want to watch some sporting event during lunch. I came for the Euro 2008 match between Russia and Sweeden and almost every T.V. there had it on. They have a decent-sized screen in the main room and plenty of small T.V.s in their bar area where you can also treat yourself to a sub-par selection of drinks during lunch time. (Picture the alcohol version of thier ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce selection).   Its dark, wooden interior also helps you hide from a blistering hot day like today's 110 degree heat. Along with its wooden interior is plenty of camp to cover the walls and some cabinet style old school arcade machines. The fact that it has its Ms. Pac Man cabinet running is the only advantage I can see this place really having over Two Hippies or any other cheap burger joint.",

It's a casual, dive-y sort of place, which I like. There were a lot of different types of people there- firemen, loners, business men and women... It's got a huge interior, some cool copper topped tables, and some seizure inducing lights (far too blinky for an exhausted grumpy me).   You order your food at a small window once you have mooed your way through an amusement park-like railing system (albeit a short one) and you specify a burger (or from a short list of other menu items), and your options are bun type and cheese type. At no point did I get asked to what charness I want my ground cow. Hence, I ate puck on a bun. Next time, I'll ask for medium. A third pound burger was plenty (they have half pounders, too), and the bacon comes in circles (which is cool- bacon in every bite is never a bad thing!).  We also had the 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 zucchini side, which was ok. We've had better and worse of both. The topping bar was ok- your usual suspects together with the requisite peppers to make your experience  \"southwestern.\"",

Well, the burger, while decently flavorful, was a little too \"done\" for my taste, and wasn't all that hot when I got it...  Also, the cheese wasn't melted, so who knows if I just got a patty that had been sitting for awhile...   Overall a decent burger and good fries, although for a small basket of fries it was almost $2.  Burger was also not quite worth the price in my opinion.

    "text": "After having fully recovered from my nightmarish Burger Studio experience, the Husband and I decided to try another restaurant that specializes in burgers.  This time, however, was a completely different experience.  The menu has an offering of burgers, chicken, and fish and chips.  There are onion rings, fried mushrooms, and fries for sides.  A few other items round out the simple item and everything is very reasonably priced, most being under 6 dollars.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger with American cheese and a wheat bun.  A pleasant surprise is the fact that you can choose between white, wheat, and onion buns.  Yay!  We also got a side of fries to share.  The total for 2 Works burgers, a side of fries, and 2 sodas was about 16 bucks.  Not bad at all.  I could immediately see that I was getting a good burger when I took off the top bun and visited the condiment bar.  The burger patty itself was large and slightly misshapen, definitely a hand formed patty.  The condiment bar has pretty much all the typical fixings that you would expect.  This was a good burger.  It was well seasoned, nicely cooked, and had a great charred taste.  The bun was fresh tasting and a nice change from the typical sesame seed burger bun.  The fries were portioned for one person, but they were substantial and tasty.  I really enjoyed this place from the cheap prices to the awesome vintage decor.  The tables were brushed copper and very cool looking.  The entire restaurant is actually larger than it looks from the outside and even has a bit of outdoor seating.  There is a decent sized bar on the side of the restaurant that everyone seemed to be having a great time at.  If I am in the mood for a no-nonsense good quality burger, I will definitely come here.",

The place is big, cluttered with cool stuff on the walls, and has a bar & a smoking patio.  The ordering process is fast and makes it easy.  It's like Fudruckers but edible.    I ordered the Hawaiian Burger.  While it wasn't as good as the one I used to get at Goofy Goose in Tacoma, it was still pretty good.  The patty was huge, hand-formed, and perfectly cooked.  The bun was tasty.  There was ample Swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce on the burger as well.  The only complaint was that it only had one pineapple which was a 1/4 the size of the burger.  I really only got the full \"Hawaiian Burger\" experience when I got into the middle where the pineapple was.  Oh well, it was still good.  The side order of fries was tasty enough and their onion rings looked good.    The condiment bar was a bit lacking.  I was hoping for lots of different sauces like honey mustard or horseradish but it was pretty much the basics.  The salad bar didn't look all that good to me but why are you getting a salad at a burger place?  In all, great burger, good prices, and exactly what I expected.  WAY better than Burger Studio.",

    "text": "Yesterday morning, we went to St Joe's to see our new niece. She's 6 pounds 14 ounces, 17 inches long and I absolutely love her! Less than 24 hours old, Patience Marie is quite possibly the most miraculous thing to happen in my life since the births of my nieces in Ohio.   So, seeing a newborn can certainly work up an appetite and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to go to Original Hamburger Works. My mother-in-law shared a story about her last visit here, as we left the hospital. Apparently, on of the barmaids was celebrating her last day by exposing her breasts and allowing male patrons to feel their suppleness. Or offer their services in checking for abnormal conditions. Of this I was unclear. But, we verified that Original Hamburger Works does indeed have hamburgers so off we went.   This was my first time going to OHW, and I must admit it's a bit confusing--especially if you come in the back entrance. Just so you don't walk in and take a seat (and look like a fool waiting for someone to wait on you) here's the lowdown: Proceed to the main dining area and get in line. Before you order, be aware there are many choices: First, if you're ordering a burger, they come in various sized--small one, big one (1/3#), double big one (2 of the previous patties), great big one (1/2#) and super great one (+1#). Then there's the buns, either onion, whole wheat or white. Then, there's the cheeses: Swiss, cheddar, jalapeno jack, American, provolone). If you're too intimidated to build your own burger, there are about half a dozen specialty burgers from which to chose. We ended up getting the Big One special, which came with fries for $5.49 but does not include your drink. Don't worry, though. They have a fully stocked bar in the next room!   After your name is called, you can doctor up your burger with their selection of toppings. I went with the simple scoop of mayo. You do know white people love mayonnaise? Truly a wonderful burger.  How I'd never been to OHW prior to this weekend is beyond me. I know I'll be going back again and again. We did not, however, have to be subjected to exposed breasts during our visit. Unless you consider the ones of the chicken being grilled next to our burgers.",

You can even see your burger being cooked if you want--and no, none of the burgers have been sitting and drying out to year-old cow-patty consistency, which is another bonus. And there's a great variety of burgers, too!   And these folks are generous in the community, too--one year, they donated one whole day's worth of revenues to the family of a Phoenix police officer who had been killed in the line of duty.

There are fries, of course and the veggie burger I guess if you want that (which I am sure is thrown on the same grill so it gets a nice coating of beef fat).  They make burgers, pretty dang good burgers.  Decently quick and to order.  Plus a condiment bar (that seems to be missing BBQ sauce, for shame).  If you want something that isn't a burger you shouldn't be going to a place called \"Burger Works\" to begin with.  If you want a good burger, it's a good choice.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in Central Phoenix, in need of a meal, this is a great option.  I frequent this place, because it's close to work and popular with my co-workers.  I've been coming here since the 80's, so you know it has a huge following of long-term customers.  It's pretty much the same now as it was back in the day.  You get in a line, and place your order.  Get at least a 1/3 lb burger; any smaller and I think they come out a little tough.  Their 'Classic' burger is amazing- patty, cheese, mushrooms, bacon.  HEAVEN!  You can mix your fried sides, or just get fries.  They have great onion rings, zucchini, fries, and mushrooms.  Serve your own drink.  They call you name to pick up your food, and you head over with your big pizza-pan type tray and add your fixins from a generously stocked condiments bar.  In addition, they have a bar with basic drinks and sports playing on TV's, if that's your thing.  It's a great place to meet up with friends. Friendly and casual atmosphere.  Lots of locals, college students, hospital employees, police officers and firefighters here.  Would I drive 10 miles to this location, just to get a burger?  Likely not, but it's a GREAT option if you are down here in the 'hood, going to the airport, a museum, a play, the courthouses, or another place in Central Phoenix.  A NOTE- they have great grilled chicken, and salad is an option if you are on-the-wagon in terms of burgers and fries.",

I can see why this place can get busy with its well sized burgers and proper pricing to go along with it during the week and lunch time for many.   The decor is nice and suits it for making you feel like your in a cabin bar, but wait there is a bar around the corner hah.   The ordering style is a la carte, with every add of extra cheese, tomato, onion etc adds to the costs. I ordered a big one with cheese and my wife ordered a small one with onions.   My burger was a bit more juicier then my wives, but had the same taste as if they had been bbq'ed. The quality tasted a it below angus patties but good for overall.   The fries were good.   Compared to other popular gourmet burger places I would say that for the money that it is a good buy, but if you don't mind spending the extra for better quality suggest going elsewhere.   Overall: It is a quick bite during lunch, or before a ball game, but would not be a an out of my way to go here type of food place.",

Food was really more 3 1/2 stars but the fries were bomb and I was starving so I'm feeling generous enough to bump it up to 4.  I was with a fellow Phoenician who requested to remain nameless because he is weird. Eh fuck it, I don't care that much, it was Collin S. Mystery solved, woohoo.  Now on to the burgers. All beef ground patty was on the thin side, but I was totally cool with that as it allowed me to pile on 8 feet of toppings! For once I've found a topping bar that wasn't ill-kept and made me feel like dozens of chidren's unwashed hands had been rifling through everything. Flavorful and tasty and CHEAP. Have I had superior burgers? Absolutely! But not for the price of a McDonalds happy meal and that was A-OK with me.  Bottom line, Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license.",

If you are a vegetarian or uber-health conscious there is not much on this menu if at all to please you.  The burgers are delicious as are the chicken sandwiches.  According to the menu there are fish and ham sandwich options.  Have not eaten them but they are probably good as well, same goes for the cocktails.

So last Friday after work, I said I need a burger and a beer, and we ended up here vs our usual Originial Wineburger (the 19th ave and Bethany location).   I thought the atmosphere was fun, they are going for the this-place-is-old-as-hell-and-may-fall-apart-at-any-moment-yet-clean look.  Our order was taken very quickly, but its kind of confusing that you order at one register and then walk around, and stand and wait to be noticed to pay at the other register only 10 feet from the one you were just at...but whatev.   Our food was out very fast! We each ordered burgers, then we split some fries and onion rings. The onion rings will get me to go back again, they were soooo good! The fries were ok. My burger was dry, had no flavor and the bun was stale as all get out.   The condiment bar, ie the build your own burger, didn't impress me. There was nothing special on it. Seriously toss some green olives on there and you may peak my interest...but everything on the condiment stand could easily be in bottles at each table.   I went to the bar and got 2 bottles of Stella...for $8, holy heck! Not cool. We sure as heck werent in Scottsdale last I checked we were in the avenues.   I do have to say, one thing that actually made my mouth drop open and then when I showed it to the hubs his mouth also dropped open in disbelief was that they have Barqs RED CREAM SODA!!! Thats like the holy grail of sodas right there! If they offered vanilla ice cream there I may have just moved in and lived off of red cream soda floats for the rest of my life or until I slipped into a diabetic coma.   If the hubs wants to go back I will not fight it only because of the red cream soda and the onion rings. But as far as burgers go, give me a Original Wineburger, I like burgers that have flavor, are juicy and on amazing freshly baked buns!",

I can't say enough that it's just a really great burger.   The mozzarella sticks were nothing out of this world but still really good. The jalapeno poppers though, omg. So good! They're stuffed with melty cheese and come with a super yummy south western style ranch.

    "text": "Arizona Burger Tour: Original Hamburger Works  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: Meat, cheese and toasted bun. Slightly squished, but not crushed. Nothing special, but alluring in a simple and basic way. I will say, the smell was intoxicating (I know, I know... You can smell with your eyes.)  Flavor:  The meat was well seasoned and flavorful if not a little on the charred side. The cheese was lost in translation and might as well of not been there. Each bite was consistent in the quality. The only other real issue is the meat is cooked well done, so it looses some of its beefy flavor.   Meat to bun ratio:  Nearly perfect. The patty fits to almost every edge of the bun. It was all finished at the same time. Also, the thickness of the burger complimented the toasted bun.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): Cheese. Everything else is added from the toppings bar. I won't review the burger with toppings. However, I added tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, white onion and ketchup.    Price: $5.39  Grade: B = Really good. The burger has good flavor but might have a flaw or two.   Follow the tour on Instagram at @RequiemofChaos.",

    "text": "Been coming here for years. Best wings in town. Period. I stand by these wings with my life. Seriously.   This one time I walked into burger works one evening with some friends. A guy from Mesa was with his wife at the bar and asked us as a group what to get on the menu.   We suggested they split a burger, fries and an order of wings. This guy said \"wings? Why get the wings here if this is a burger place?\" I replied to this man \"honestly bro, this place has the best wings ever.\" To which the man replied \"really the best wings? If these wings ain't the best I've had, can I stab you?\" I said to the man \"you can try bro, you can try.\"   About 20 minutes later as my buddies and I were chomping down on some wings and washing it back with some beer. The guy from Mesa who threatened to stab me came out and shook my hand. I really did see the look on a grown man's face that resembled a child going to Disneyland for the first time. \"Bro! Thank you! Thank you! Those really are the best wings ever! I'm coming back to this place! Believe that! Now I don't have to stab you and go to prison! Thanks again bro, have a good night!\"   Burger works wings are powerful. So powerful they are a solution to make violent people happy.",

Can't just put it in a nice basket? How tacky. Sorry...but I would have to be comped by someone else, in order to eat here again. Not at all worth the money or the time wasted standing in line.

Well sort of :) their BBQ is a lot bigger!    Ordering is kind of weird you order at the station next to the grill then walk around the corner to pay and then they call out your number.  I think they do this so that you can walk around and see the burgers grilling and the kitchen.    On the other side of the place there is a full bar.  They also have an outside eating area and back entrance.    The food is awesome.  I have been here pretty regular since I discovered it on yelp.  The buns have always been fresh and the burgers are grilled so they are not as juicy and greasy.  But thats a good thing.  They have an awesome flavor! The condiment bar is pretty cool.  You get the standard fair.  This is pretty much a build your own burger place.  I like to take my burger and put lettuce tomato onions and thousand island.  Its like an in and out on steroids!   The fried fair is good. Im not a fan of their french fries I usually go for the half mushroom/zucchini combo.  But if you get a combo with fries I recommend getting a ranch cup from the condiment bar and dipping them in that.  Their ranch is so good!     The Chicken sandwich is also good.  Get the plain unless you want to be covered in sauce.   Overall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank.  Only thing I would knock a star off is for customer service.  About half the time the person behind the counter seems to have an attitude for some reason.    Will be back for another burger.",

Don't be fooled by the name \"small one\" their burgers are a pretty good size and when you add all your toppings from the salad bar, it gets even BIGGER!

I said fine, take that off the order and then I can apply it to the wings. She STILL said no since the coupon said upto $8 and the wings were a bit over $8. Now any moron knows that with this kind of coupon, you'd just get the credit of $8. In fact I used a very similar Q-pon just the previous nite at another restaurant and they had no issues with me using in. Even worse, I have used this EXACT qpon at this EXACT same establishment many times over the years! I ended just canceling the order and walking out in disgust. I think management needs to train their cashiers on how these Q-pons work. The cashier 2nite was clearly clueless. I worked a 12 hour day and came in here very hungry not expecting this at all. Instead I left hungry and angry. Disgusted with this experience 2nite. Dont eat here, they will screw you!!",

The food was the same as always... but I would recommend not getting the Small One, burger isn't big enough to get enjoy the flavor.   The service, if that is what you can call it was horrid! My mouth was agape most of the evening in disbelief. \"Did she just do that?\" Was pretty much my thinking. First my mothers wine glass was disgustingly dirty, never should have been brought to the table. They when she asked for a new one and pointed out how dirty it was the bartender looked at it like \"Umm looks fine to me..\" and just wanted away. We watched her put the glass back on the rack with the other \"clean\" glasses and grab another one. She didn't inspect it to make sure it was clean before handing it off, this one was just as dirty and had lipstick all over it. Me being a bartender asked for a rocks glass, figuring they would be cleaner and less lipstick, she handed me a shot glass. WHATEVER I took it and gave it to my mom. Once she finally came back to the table we pointed out the hideousness of the second wine glass and in the same fashion, probably more irritated, inspected it said \"Okay?!\" walked back behind that bar and put it back on the shelf. Are you kidding me?!?! Were we being punked? Ridiculous!   Like I said, the food was good, but the service was out outrageous! I hope they read this and get their shit under control. The behavior is unacceptable for a McDonald's.   I am sure we will go back someday, but if she is there, I will leave, if not I will stay but make sure to only order beer in a bottle, no glassware!",

    "text": "Although I had no plans to eat here, the opportunity presented itself and my husband was getting hungry so I had only minutes before there was a possibility he would launch into d-bag mode.  OHW reminds me of Bun Huggers in Flagstaff both in decor and concept, where you wait in line to order off the overhead menu, burgers are cooked to order, and you help yourself to the topping bar.  Only here, the green chiles are fresh.  + 100 stars for that!  Burger and rings were great, but the fries were nothing special.  Several sized burgers are offered (in addition to chicken and fish) which is great for me because the one thing I can't eat in vast quantities is ground beef, so the small is the perfect size.  The topping bar was reasonably clean, they were busy, but the produce looked fresh.  They even have the coke dispenser with the computer interface, as well as the standard fountain.  While in theory it should shorten the drink lines, not so much when there's a child in front of you or a 40+-year old who needs instruction on how to work it.  Screw you dude behind me waiting impatiently while I read the instructions!",

It's a bit far for us to go, but we've been there twice already.    The food reminds me of a place in CA that had equally great mesquite grilled burgers.  The salad bar is good too.  I just wish they had real bacon bits rather than the fake stuff.  All of the other salad ingredients are fresh and delicious, if somewhat standard.  The single serving plate is reasonably priced and generous in proportion.  Too large, really, because I had to take my burger to go after eating the salad!  It made a great dinner.    My wife enjoys the onion rings very much. I sneaked a bite of hers and can attest to their quality.  She is not as jazzed about this place as I am, but does like the food.  Weekdays this place can be quite busy due to it's proximity to business.  However, we did not have to wait in line to order, found an open booth, and our food was ready in no time.  It's a burger place and has it's own special character (meaning old building and decor.)  If you are looking for good burgers in Phoenix, this is the best I've found so far.",

    "text": "Stopped by here as the BF was craving a good burger and the reviews looked good. Going to be honest here, not sure what all the hype is about. I found the burger to be dry, and flavorless. I like by burgers juicy and with some seasoning. This seemed to be just some ground beef slapped on the grill. Good grill char on the meat though. Even the bacon, which was definitely a generous portion , was very dry and not very flavorful. Now the fries were great. Skin on and looked fresh cut . Order a side for sure.  The place had a good, low key vibe with what looked like a cool little bar on one side of the restaurant. We didn't sit in there so can't really review it. They also had a solid condiment bar and free refills on soda. Location is great and plenty of parking. Plenty of options for non burger eaters.   Overall, if you like a simple, no frills, no seasoning, burger where you can bring the kids or hang for a few drinks with friends, this place is OK. If you want a nice, juicy, well seasoned burger with some flavor then this may not be your spot.",

The burgers are served naked ( meat, cheese, bun ) and the toppings and condiments are added by you.  They offer the standard toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc. burgers were not over cooked, nor did they ask for a preferred cook temp. None the less, the burgers were juicy and flavorful, due in part of being cooked on a Santa Maria grill and mesquite charcoal. Bun was perfectly toasted, I likes me some toasted buns. :)  The sides are good as well. I opted for my old favorite onion rings. Portion was good, fry was perfect.  They do have a bar connected so alcohol is available if you sit there.   All in all, if you want a good burger with classic faire, this is the place. I like the rustic decor as well.",

We had jalapeno poppers and fries. I had the bacon cheese burger perfectly cooked. The mesquite grill really makes a difference. The wings looked good will have to try that next time.

We entered from the back where you walk through their bar to get into the main dining area. You walk over to place where they take your order and my usual has always been the Big One with cheese. The others orders were the Small One, and Great Big One. The Great Big One was ordered with bacon and cheese. I have always enjoyed all the items on the walls that at times take you back. Like the Nehi soda, Barq's soda, Carnation milk signs and so on. When they call your name you go pick up your order and head over to the condiments area and put on your hamburger whatever you please. Their frys have the skins on them which I absolutely like. I also ordered jalapeno poppers which are not hot but very tasty.  For some of you that prefer chicken or even fish they have that for you as well. Those are very delicious if that's your thing.  The bar that's part of this is actually very quaint. If you want to spend a Saturday afternoon having a brew and watching sports on the many screens surrounding the bar. It is located on the southeast corner of West Thomas Road and 15th Avenue. It has been a staple of this area and really accommodates Phoenix College which is right across Thomas Road to the north. If you ever go by here stop in and enjoy a good hamburger. If any of can tell me let me know when the Original Hamburger Works first opened, I would like to hear from you. I personally have been going here since the 80's.",

I always get the same burger..teriyaki with provolone. It is the best burger that I have had, since moving back to Phoenix.  Always juicy & flavorful My husband has had the teriyaki chicken sandwich twice, and the chicken breast is huge. He really likes it.  We have enjoyed their onion rings , jalapeno poppers, and waffle fries. They also have basic salad bar, which is no frills, but good. If you like those fancy soda machines, they have one, along with free popcorn.  They have a decent beer selection, the typical well drinks, and I often see people enjoying the white wine.

Service was super nice. You can see the real chicken breasts and burger patties being made on the grill and the food definitely looked, felt, and tasted high quality.",

    "text": "Great casual burger restaurant and bar that caters to the downtown Phoenix crowd, Encanto golf course and neighborhood and students from Phoenix College along with St. Mary's and Brophy Prep High School students. Go in for lunch on a weekend and you'll find numerous golfers cooling off after a round on the links and on Friday nights during high school football season you'll see families getting a bite before Brophy Games at the Phoenix College stadium.  The burgers are big and juicy and with the condiment bar you can add whatever toppings you like. The french fries are thick and seasoned well. My wife loves the ham steak sandwich and the kids like the choice of hamburgers, hot dogs or chicken fingers.  The decor is like an old-fashioned tavern with gas station and other kitschy decorations overlooking wood benches and tables. The TV's usually have ESPN or some sporting events on and you can also sit at the bar or on the patio when the weather permits.  As a whole, the restaurant is very reminiscent of the Chuck Box in Tempe and the Monastery that used to be at 28th and Indian School. A great casual atmosphere to get eats and drinks without the pretension found at some of the new upscale burger joints in town.  Good food for a great price!",

A bargain in my books! If you want hipster, upscale dining try someplace else. If you want good burgers, yummy fries and onion rings, this is your place. We'll be back!",

Can't stand them even with a little pink in the middle. Any time I eat here, I always get mine well done. LOVE that I can sit in the bar and have a cold one and order a burger too.   Why not 5 stars? When sitting in the bar, service is slow. Bartender seems more interested in waiting on folks at the bar, and less interested in folks in the booths. Also, they are stingy with their fries. For the price, they need to heap those babies on the plate. Other than that, excellent place.",

They have a condiment bar to add your own toppings, all I added was a little mayo, ketchup, and mustard.....that burger was a flame broiled disc of greatness!

The menu feels a little high priced for what you're actually getting, lots of grease.    Without being too harsh as it really isn't that bad.

With longevity like that, you know they have to be doing something right.  The setup is a bit like Five Guys or Fuddruckers - you walk up to the counter and order your burger and side. You have a choice of bun (white, wheat, onion) and cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, provolone). They call your name and you add your own condiments from the condiment buffet (which doubles as the salad bar). I really like this setup because you get to put as little or as much whatever you want on it. I wish they had some hot cheese like Fuddruckers, though. My burger with fries was $5.99 - they charge extra for cheese and extras like mushrooms or bacon. A soda with unlimited refills (and they have one of those crazy touch screen soda machines) was $1.79.   The burger was excellent quality and cooked just right - though they didn't ask how I wanted it. I guess they do everyone's medium? The fries were thick cut and really good. This place is definitely recommended.",

I am sure glad  we gave then a shot.  We walked in to the dinning room which was pretty full (a good hing) and up to where you would make you menu selections. The great thing is you walk right past the grill where you see what is the beginning of your burger.  Awesome to see this right out front.  Kind of a honesty approach to how we build a great burger. So we order a Bacon Chess Burger and California Burger both the largest size burger.  Both burgers were exceptional and the prices were low to what you receive. Extremely affordable. The staff was great and our surprise the location is about 3-4 blocks from where we live. A win win! So if you want a extremely tasty, affordable, very large portion and just a all around awesome burger the hit these guys up. You will not be disappointed.  Just a great little gem on N 15th Ave. Once again you will not be disappointed at all......",

The place wasn't crowded at all; a few folks outside on the patio, maybe two tables in the bar, and few in the dining area.   First we had to clean-off our own booth, second no one acknowledged we were there, third after about 10 mins we went to bar, still had to wait, fourth we walked out.  I've been to these places before (Chuckbox for example), raw wood on the walls, dimly lit, the smell of the flat grill and burgers sizzling, but this place is not one where I would return.",

The 2 star review is bc of the service that my party was given by the 2 middle-aged barkeeps. They have mastered the \"I saw you but I'm going to act like I didn't\" move. I was perplexed when I saw that the restaurant employs younger people.. why aren't they the bartenders? If you're a server and suck at your job, you better at least be good looking. The bartenders at this place have nothing going for them except undeserved pride.",

My favorite things about the place are the flame grilled burgers (yumm), the honey mustard, and the fries were equally delicious.  My one little critique that keeps this from being perfect, is I like my burger cooked to a certain wellness, so I would have liked the choice. But that burger was still good though!",

The place seems kinda dusty and dingy when you walk and there an unappetizing looking salad bar/condiment table that you line up next to when you place your order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat. The bun was just a grocery store bun, standard american cheese, a bland under seasoned and overlooked burger. The bacon was great, but that's honestly the only thing I liked here.   There are better places everywhere you turn with the trendy burger joints popping up a lot in the valley. The fries, which I didn't order but my coworkers did, appeared to be frozen. I just hope for more- get fresh ingredients- make your fries- season the burger. Pass on this place and take your hard earned cash elsewhere.",

Possibly the poor service is San issue specifically in the bar?  The burger was large and tasty. The chicken breast sandwich was very large, juicy and flavorful. I liked the veggie cart to put my own toppings on it. It was clean and everything looked fresh.  Tons of options for non alcoholic fountain drinks including 3 different iced teas which always makes me happy. My only disappointment was I ordered the chicken and salad special but they must not have heard me because I received fries instead of salad. I would've swapped it out but the line was long at that point. Promising side is I now know to order no sides next time as the chicken was more than enough.",

Upon arriving we walked through the dining room and sat in the bar at a table. After waiting several minutes without the server/bartender acknowledging us, we went up to the bar and placed an order. We ordered chicken strips, baked potato, and 1/3 lb burger with fries. We also ordered two Bud Lights, after discovering beer options are limited and what appears to be a full bar is not so full after all.   The chicken strips were more fried batter than chicken, though what chicken was there was not dried out. The baked potato was find. The burger was basic but had little flavor and was a very poor quality meat, as there were small hard balls of fat in many bites. The condiment bar may seem fun, but it includes only the very basics- tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, and a few hotter toppings. Good, but not special.   The server never came back to take another drink order. Though it was over an hour from closing time, she spent her time cleaning and stacking unused bar stools.   Overall not a good experience. Fast food would taste better and cost less. The only reason to go is a nearby bar with sports on TVs.",

I usually go with the \"On the Border Burger\" with fries and a cherry vanilla Mister Pibb.  The bar is worth hitting up too if you are in the market to throw back a few while any of the local Valley sports teams play.  Outside of that, the toppings bar is well stocked, and clean.  The food is always tasty and made in front of you with a relatively short wait.  The restaurant is easy to find on the south east corner of 15th Ave & Thomas.  My only star deduction is due to the fact that the tables are usually not cleaned well or fast enough.  I shouldn't have to clean up after the last customer, but most of the time I have.",

Working for a place with offices in Downtown Phoenix and in Glendale, the location was actually quite convenient with plenty of parking available.  While there was a long line when we walked in, it went VERY fast and I had to even make some quick decisions when I made it to the counter.  The price is right whether you want a combo meal, a one-pound burger for under $10, or more \"normal\" sized burgers or chicken sandwiches.    The food itself was very good!  I had a Big One (1/3 lb) and fries combo meal.  My four friends had either burgers or chicken sandwiches with a variety of sides (salad, fried pickles, fried mushrooms, or fries).  Everyone seemed quite happy with their choices.  And I learned quickly that they had all been to the Original Hamburger Works on several prior occasions.  Now, having tried it myself, I plan on coming back, too.  Thanks, Original Hamburger Works, for a great first experience!",

I don't have the opportunity to visit as much anymore but it's always such an incredible thrill when I do.  I have a hard time eating a lot of hamburgers these days as most places just don't offer anything that satisfying.  McDonald's - which I actually loved once upon a time - doesn't even taste like a hamburger at all anymore; the only sensation I get biting into one of their burgers is the taste of over-processed chemical mixture.  So when I am in the mood for a really good burger that I know will please me, satisfy my craving and at the same time is reasonably priced, this is one of the main places I turn to.  The burgers taste just like a good hamburger should.  And no \"where's the beef?\" scenarios here...you get a nice big plentiful patty!  The condiment station allows you to dress it up just as you like and the fries are also an excellent complement (amazing how rare it is to find a place where the burgers and the fries are just as good as the other.)  Looking over some of the other reviews here and I'm both shocked and surprised that there's numerous mentions of poor service which is something I've never experienced in all the times I've ever visited.  Long wait times, yes but never bad service.  But then mind you, I'm not a drinker and don't use the bar and it seems like the bar portion is where a lot of other people's complaints are directed towards.  But me personally, I've neither experienced nor witnessed poor service so I can't factor that into my own rating/review.  Nice comfortable cozy atmosphere, excellent food which tastes like one would hope and prices that are completely fair.  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.",

    "text": "I can only really comment on the bar. First of all I went in there around Happy Hour times and there wasn't really any good drink specials. The bartender boasted 4 dollar Mexican beers in a bottle. Not too bad, but most of the draft selection was domestic so I settled on a Pacifico. The bartender was nice initially friendly, but didn't come by to check on me at all.   I don't want to be rude, but the bartender wasn't the most refined individual. After waiting for my check for my single beer, she got in a fight with the woman next to me (who she had completely over served) over the fact that she was taking lemons out of the cocktail tray while she wasn't looking. Which resulted in a shouting match between her and the intoxicated patron.   Prior to getting my check the bartender asked if I knew the guy who was posted at the bar next to me. I did not, so I just shrugged. She asked if I was buying his drink since he had apparently walked out on it. After explaining that he had just taken a seat next to me, she handed me my check and I paid and left as soon as I could.  The service was about as bad as it smelled on the bar side unfortunately.",

If you are not a meat eater your options are limited, and on my visit they were out of veggie burgers. Luckily they have a cod sandwich (4.79). If you want a side think cut fries are a steep $1.75 for a small tray or they have other options like fried zucinni that is upwards of $3  The condiment section is great with jalapenos peppers sauces galore onions lettuce and tomato.  for a drink they have a new coke flavor wave which is always fun, and there is a bar that is connected with free popcorn which is a big plus for me. (that is why its 4 stars)  My fish sandwich it self tasted of char and the included tar tar sauce, the bun was soft and fresh. Despite saying its was some large fraction of a pound of fish it seemed a bit thin and small.  Overall if you are a vegetarian, pescaterian you can make by here but it should not be your first choice.",

    "text": "Last night was my first time at Original Hamburger Works and was most likely the last.  The employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed clueless.  When ordering and asking the order-taker basic questions about the menu, she would only quickly answer \"I don't know\" with a blank stare on her face.  When picking up my order at the counter, the young man just looked at me when I said thank you.  Not a good way to win over customers.  You must go over into the bar area to purchase alcoholic drinks and for some odd reason, they don't take debit cards after 7 pm.  Strange.  The food was just okay.  Being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus.  I got the Big One while my wife got the Border Burger.  The burgers were well cooked and had a good taste, but weren't outstanding.  We also ordered the half onion rings and fries basket, which was just basic fare.    The deal-breaker came when I went to the men's room after dining.  Upon entering the hall leading to the restrooms, I noticed a foul, sewer-like smell.  After entering the restroom, I was quickly overtaken with the stench.  I've been in port-a-potties that had more pleasant smells than this.    While the concept of this restaurant has merit, it's poorly executed, unfortunately.  It has potential, but obviously lacks good management.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at this time.",

    "text": "If you like to eat and you're not a vegetarian, you've likely heard of The Original Hamburger Works. It may even be on the list of eateries that you \"must visit when in Phoenix\" depending on who you ask.  You order your meal at a tiny window next to the grill where the burgers are cooked. Flames leap from the cooking surface as you speak your order to the...order taker? I don't know what to call her, because you don't pay here, you only order here. You walk around the corner and pay for your food.  I didn't order the gigantic burger, I opted for the big burger. With fries and a drink. I paid about $9 for it and I was told to listen for my name while I got my drink from the digital Coke machine.  About ten minutes later, I hear my name and retrieve my food. There's a toppings bar with condiments to apply to your sammich. After one bite of this big burger, it's clear that it deserves steak sauce, grilled onions and salt and pepper and not the usual condiments and toppings. The beef is tasty and delicious and I am doing it wrong with lettuce, tomato, onions, Cholula and mayo. Without the bun and with a knife and fork, it'd fit right in as a \"chopt steak\" at most steakhouses.   The fries were not remarkable, but they were adequate sidekicks for the hamburger.   The part of town that the restaurant inhabits is a little bit run down. The parking available is suspect at best- the small strip mall on the corner has narrow spaces and on-street parking is limited. The clientele is a mix of tourists, neighborhood denizens and locals trying to grab a bite to eat.  Try it on a Saturday after 1pm for ease of enjoyment.",

    "text": "Upon the high marks that this place got I ventured out to try it for myself.  Unfortunately, I found the burgers underwhelming.  Granted, I ordered it for take-out, but the 15 minutes between pick up and consumption shouldn't have caused the meat to be so dry.  Maybe it was the de-humidifier that I was running on the way home that had something to do with it.  I read that the burgers were made to order and they did make the burgers that I ordered, though they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked.  There too, I'm a dick and you'd want to get off the phone with me too.  But ultimately when I got home the first burger I bit into was very dry.  I can't give a fair review of the second burger because I tried it the next morning off the counter where I left it.  You know what they say about breakfast.  I can say the bun was still good.  Maybe that's where the moisture went.  This review is in no way associated with that experience.  More so it speaks to the fact that I eat anything.   I also ordered onion rings, zuchini and mushrooms.  I ate the rings on my way home and they were good although not plentiful.  The zuchini and mushrooms were ok.  Since it was take-out I can't really elaborate on the decor too much other than salad theft must be a real problem in that neighborhood.  Due to the location (relative to me) and the vast number of other burger options, I will probably not be back.  But that's just my experience, another patron did make a point to compliment the staff on a fine burger on his way out while I was there.",

I ordered the \"classic\" which is the cheese of your choice with mushrooms and bacon.  We also ordered an order of chili fries to share. The burger is served on a no frills styrfoam plate., because that's what it is, an honest to goodness no bull$&amp;@t tasty burger. And it was just that a big carb riddled well made slice of heaven.  The chili fries we're also very  good, I could see myself just eating a bowl of the chili, they we're literally swimming in chili and cheese.

What a limited, sad assortment of limp offerings with everything having traces of it's neighbor as if there was a food fight.  With the dim lighting and greasy plastic sneeze guard it gave the veggies Gaussian blur I imagine you get just before you croak. If the bar in Star Wars had a salad bar this would be it complete with interesting and diverse looking patrons.  After lunch over our empty paper plates, plastic utensils and round aluminum pizza tins we made a vow to never return.  Black tee shirts for the staff, dim lighting and grease everywhere brought on thoughts of a prison mess hall during a black out. With all the choices in Phoenix we will have our lunch in a cheerful environment with personable servers and fresh food",
