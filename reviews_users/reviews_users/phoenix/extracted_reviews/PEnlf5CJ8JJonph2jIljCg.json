Over all the food and service is very good. Very attentive and food is HUGE! No matter what you order, it's tough to finish.  Bakery has a lot to offer anyone who comes in. Bagels are fresh in the morning, but I would not recommend purchasing after 11AM.  The cream cheese is awesome, which we brought home tonight.",

    "text": "I have eaten several times at Chompies and the food seems to have gone downhill in my opinion.  My husband and I went for breakfast to the Chandler location.  We got there at 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday.  We walk in and the hostess asked us how many in our party.  It was just the two of us and she said ok, hold on a sec.  So we waited while she went to get menus and then came back to seat us.  We were two of the maybe ten customers in the place.  Not sure why we had to wait when the place was empty.  Kinda weird.  Our waitress was very nice, took our order and was all around a great gal.  The food however was not that great today.  I ordered the Cragel Riser.  A cross between a bagel and a croissant.  There was nothing croissanty about it.  It was a bagel, period!  And a very dried out bagel at that.  It was awful.  The eggs were very dry and folded in half and you could barely find any bacon in it.  I left most of it on the plate. And it is too big for the plate.  The top part of the Cragel had to be placed on a napkin on the table, not good.  Just put it on the bigger plate!  My husband had the whole grain pancakes.  He said they were ok but the butter they gave him to put on it was in those little prepackaged squares and it was ice cold and hard as a rock.  Can ya just put some soft butter in a little cup and serve it that way!  Terrible presentation skills as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe I am watching too much Top Chef but I know how something should be served.  Cold butter on pancakes is just not good.   The coffee was decent, but that was about it.  Not sure what the deal is here but food is not good anymore.  The last time I bought the rugelah from the bakery they were stale and hard.  I complained about it when I got home and they offered to give me some new ones.  For 15.00 bucks a pound they should be fresh and tasty.  Now I know why I won't go back, unless the food improves immensely.  They just have too much on the menu to have good consistent quality food.",

What a pleasant surprise it was when we were actually greeted by the General Manager, Adam, who welcomed us and who was friendly and cordial.  We were taken to our table by the hostess and from that point on everything was outstanding. The food was excellent and served promptly. The restaurant appeared very clean and attended to which is important to us.  We had ample leftovers which were bagged for us when we left.  The entire staff smiled and thanked us for coming.  Wow, it doesn't get better than that.  I can see why people would return to this restaurant.",

We ordered Door Dash to have a relaxing Sunday while enjoying our favorite breakfast delivered from Chompies. How disappointed do you think we were when our driver arrived with just my order and not my husband's with the only excuse given to us was that the Chompies manager simply told the driver, \"we don't have blintzes any longer\". NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT TO CALL US!?! Once calling Door Dash to complain, they blamed Chompies, Adrian (the manager at Chompies) simply blamed Door Dash. Around and around the blame went. Once I asked Adrian how can she make this right before losing our business and me taking this to social media, she finally suggested she would send one of her extremely short staffed employees with whatever we wanted. No, thank you, after an hour of giving Chompies the chance to make things right, too little too late. We will NEVER eat here again.",

    "text": "Chompie's is always a good idea. The native New Yorker/bagel/pastry lover in me is always satisfied when I come here. Today's experience was nothing less than great. My bf and I came in around 5:30 PM and sat at the bar which is always open seating. We weren't too hungry but needed to have dinner and because our resolution is to make \"healthier\" choices when eating out, so we went with the crispy chicken salad (has a more specific name but I can't remember). I told our server we were sharing and when it came out, it was surprisingly split in 2 generous dishes. This made me wonder how huge the salad is unsplit because our respective dish filled us both! And the salad was deliciously made with fresh greens, tomatoes, corn, cheddar cheese topped with breaded chicken and their famous onion strings (my favorite part of it!). It comes with chipotle ranch and we were accidentally served with regular ranch on the side so I asked for the chipotle ranch which has a much tastier flavor in my opinion. I do love everything and anything chipotle. Our server was nice and attentive. After our quick dinner, I looked through the pastries to buy some whole wheat bread to take home. I also picked up the black and white cookie for dessert to-go. It is sweet goodness! A huge sugar cake cookie with half chocolate and half vanilla (I think) icing. The cookie itself to me has a slight lemony flavor to it. Yum!! All good things, all good things.",

I ordered an egg sandwich, scrambled eggs dry and sausage on an onion bagel.  My husband had scrambled eggs dry and an cinnamon raise bagel.  Well when our meal came out we both had two eggs and our bagels.... I didn't get a sandwich. When I pointed it out, our waitress Tracy offered to take it back right away and I just said it was fine.  The eggs were runny, and my bagel was burned.  I asked to talk to a manager at this point. It was our first time there and based on what had happened this far we weren't coming back.  The manager took my whole meal off the bill but my main concern was that they didn't have the issue again with the clients that were about to come in.  Tracy was awesome though!! Very friendly (even though she was stuck working Christmas morning, I'd be a brat if I was working probably)  After the issue was addressed, based on the customer service, I'd give them another try. The home fries were delicious.",

    "text": "We recently discovered Chompies In Chandler Az. Our first visit about two weeks ago went well and we very happy with the food and the service. We went back yesterday and have no idea what happened. Our food was terrible and service mediocure . When we arrived there was only one couple there. the soup special was Albondigas , a Mexican soup I have eaten and made many times in my life, so I was excited. I ordered the white fish salad half sandwich with soup and my son ordered the mile high Pastramie with fries. My meal: the fish salad was the worst I ever had. The consistency was like a cream cheese smear with no flavor just fishy and salty It was like they put every thing through a blender (Terrible). The bread was cold like it was prevously in a fridge. Worse than the sandwich was the soup. It had no  semblance to Albondigas except it had a meatball in it. It had a thick tomato base broth with potatoes and carrots. I even called the server to see if they had made a mistake. She said no that it was the Albondigas. I realize a Jewish deli may not be the best place for Albondigas but if they don't know how to make it they should not make it a feature soup of the day. That was my meal now for my sons meal. His Pastrami sandwich liked like a pyramid. Meat was all in the middle only to make it tall and none on the sides, made it only a third sandwich at best. The Pastrami was cold and dry. Again the bread was cold. Even worse the fries looked like they were left over, kinda grey looking and again cold. In addition there was only one couple there, already eating and it took 25 minutes to get our meal. I would never go back nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

We came in after lunch was over, and I think we got stuck between servers coming and going.  That does not make it alright, but I am trying to be objective.  The biggest complaint - OVERPRICED!!!!  $70 for lunch for 5 is stupid expensive.  The portions are really big, but taking a to-go box in Phoenix in the summer just isn't possible.  I would rather have paid less and gotten half as much food.  As to the sliders - they were good, but a little overrated.  All in all, I went, I don't hate it, but I am not hurrying to go back.",

This time I had been craving pancakes for awhile and I had some time off and was looking for a good place to fulfill my craving. I remembered Chompie's had good pancakes. So off I went. What a great choice. I got the Breakfast of Champions which is two pancakes, eggs and bacon. I also got a side of sourdough toast. Boy did that hit the spot. It was so good I ate all of it. Don't think I ate anything else the rest of the day. The pancakes were nice and fluffy just what I had been craving. They also bring out a pickle sampler plate with some new pickles and regular pickles. They are so good. I will definitely be back to order more bagels, lox, pancakes, sandwiches and everything.

A friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  We were seated in a \"party room\" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  The floor hadn't been swept.  And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.  So now for the real problem...  We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  We all ordered food and drinks.  It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time?  Drinks finally arrived.  Then nothing.  It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  I'm not joking.  An hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  Everyone was hungry.  Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  When our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.  The one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's.  Which is excellent.  The ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  But the service was a complete fail.  They knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us.",

I think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.  Most recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.    I also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.    The bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.    Only once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!",

We were seated promptly and our waitress took our drink orders. I ordered the Lovey's Smoked Salmon Tapas and absolutely LOVED them! They were 4 potato pancakes (latkes) topped with sour cream, sauteed Nova lox, and covered with the traditional chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and capers. The latkes were thick but still crisp and the flavors were all perfectly balanced. Very filling too! I can't wait to return to have these again! The free breakfast hubby received came with 2 eggs, hash browns, and your choice of a bagel, toast, or  English muffin. Hubby also ordered a side of corned beef hash to go along with it. He said everything tasted good and he had no complaints. I had a bite of his corned beef hash and I totally agreed with him. Plenty of corned beef and seasoned really well. Our daughter had a skillet breakfast and she enjoyed it although she did make a comment that it was a little dry and wished she had not requested the gravy on the side. Service was great and the sandwiches that were being served to other customers while we were making our way out looked absolutely amazing! I can't wait to return - now I just have to decide for which one first - breakfast or lunch?!",

My mom had the matzo ball soup.  She said it was so good that it reminded her of the soup her mom made.  Zach was very attentive and made sure our beverages were always full.   The only disappointing part was we were too full to try any of the delicious looking desserts.   We will definitely be back!",

I got up my nerve and showed the waiter my sandwich.  He didn't act surprised, and told me that's normally how the meat usually is.  WHAT?!  So I paid for fat.   Thats when I asked the question about kosher, to astonishingly learn, Chompie's is NOT a kosher deli/restaurant.  How deceiving!  I was not happy!  And then, to learn that they \"just use the word Style\".  WHY?!And you conveniently put it next to \"Kosher\".  Hmmm?!  As to pose as being kosher?!  Maybe I'm just too trusting.  Needless to say that this seemed very deceiving to me so, needless to say, I never went back.",

I had ordered it with gravy on the side so sadly it was too dry for me, but maybe some salsa would have helped. The restaurant was packed, but that didn't affect the service time which is a win in my book! The day old bread they sell is amazing and be sure to stop by the bakery for a treat to go before you leave.",

Waiters name was Alex younger black dude. He was nice just took forever to do everything this morning. Coffee cup set empty most of breakfast. Food took forever to come out. When it did my corn beef hash was ice cold with a hot egg on top, that made for a really weird first bite. The food was actually delivered by the General Manager. It was busy and maybe he didn't notice the place was cold. Now I'm not one to send food back so I just ate the bagel. Figured when Alex came back and had seen I only ate the bagel he'd ask. Ha! Nope just said \"let me get this out of the way\" maybe Alex was having an off day or maybe he was overwhelmed with his section. So I still gave him a good tip. On the way out I see Alex helping a lady pick out cookies in the bakery... good customer service for the lady I guess but what about the 9 tables full of people with no coffee and cold food... oh well, Chompie's is still one of my favorites. Just failed me this morning.  UPDATE: Less than 24hrs later a member of Chompie's reached out to me and expressed concern over the issues I had. This is why I love this place. Truly care about their customers. I can't stress enough how happy I am with their response. So I've change my review to 4 stars",

Something that is familiar, yet he described it in a way which made me realize it had been a while since I'd had any, and I've been thinking about it since!

After we were served and grabbed a slider we looked at each other in confusion because the sliders were almost cold. We flagged down the server and asked if they should be hot, she said that yes they are a warm dish and said that the food had just came up and walked away!  We waited for her to come back around and asked to please take them back and warm them up. I would have thought they would have either taken the fries or served with new \"hot\" fries to go along with the sandwiches. The side of coleslaw is a joke. Compared to the fruit you get for the same price. The sliders are always good, but the temperature and service, is reason for 3 stars.",

Even so, our waiter, who was awesome, was fast and we had food in just a few minutes.  We were finishing right at 9 and could hear people in the kitchen cleaning up.  At 9:03 an older Hispanic lady bussing tables came to take our plates.  That was fine, but she was incredibly rude, talked rudely to us, tried to take my drink (and when I said I wasn't done with it she tried to grab it from me).  She slapped her hand on the table in some sort of angry protest at us too.  We weren't even the last people and we're still just waiting for our check.  I was a little shocked at our treatment. The waiter walked up just a minute behind her and was just as good as ever. As we left I spoke to a woman I thought was the manager and told her that if coming in at 8:30 was a problem they shouldn't  have let us know at the time and that it was fine.  There are other places in the area open late we could've gone to.   I hadn't been treated that rudely in a long time. She seemed somewhat shocked too but in retrospect I think she may not have been the manager either.",

    "text": "I honestly loved this restaurant and this location for a couple years. I never had anything but a positive experience, but then a change occured a few months back. First, it was subtle, a few menu items changed pages or went missing from what was a frankly over-sized menu in the first place, so nothing to worry about. Then, one day the menu had changed from 6 or so pages with extra inserts for even more items to 3 pages in total. This was a welcome change at first, even if it meant losing some items I actually liked.  As we looked closely, however, I realized slowly that almost nothing was missing. They had crammed in margins on every page, taking at least two pages of menu items and practically hiding half of them in the margins. This was not a good sign. It said to me they were almost entirely doing this to reduce the cost of printing menus. It also may have resulted from complaints from the employees, which were starting to become noticeably aged. I'm not saying that an older man/woman can't be a good waitress, but when a restaurant suddenly goes from 90% wait staff in their 20s to 90% women in their 60s it just says to me again that they're cutting costs.  Now, cost-cutting is part of doing business, because you can't always make enough money and that demands action. But that would be with a failing or struggling restaurant. This Chompie's location, however, RARELY had open seating from sun up to sun down. It was always packed with paying customers, so they clearly had no need of cutting corners.  This brings me to the food itself. Chompie's has gone from the most consistently delicious deli-style food in town, to hands down the worst. This occured within the span of 2 months, which I can only assume coincides with a change in management. It's so bad, now, that during my last visit the Jewish Sliders which normally come with a rich, thick brown gravy were instead served with a blatantly cut gravy served lukewarm at best. It was so thin, that by comparison, if it was the same gravy at all, it would've been 10% gravy and 90% water, which I wish was an exageration, but it just isn't. You could see the bottom of the cup through it! And the brisket, which is normally cooked to perfection was clearly microwaved and so old I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled it off other uneaten sandwiches.  This is the new quality of this chompie's location, and I would warn anyone to stay away and let them go out of business, because they're no longer interested in having customers. They've proven that much.",

    "text": "I have heard a lot about Chompie's and had seen it on man V food with Adam Richman.  I have to say that I was unimpressed with both the sandwich the restaurant and the service.    The infamous and most popular Reuben sandwich left much to be desired. This restaurant apparently he feels the need to make up for average corned beef by giving you more average corned beef.  The proportion of beef two other ingredients was inadequate.  I had to ask for extra thousand Island dressing just to finish the meat portion of the sandwich, because it was dry and relatively little sauerkraut on top.    The server suggested I try the turkey sliders, which I believe I might do next time, but I do not believe that I will be ordering the Ruben at Chompie's again.    Suggestions: Cleaner restaurant Ceaner bathrooms More quality meat More toppings on the sandwich  All in all, this place just wasn't worth the hype.",

    "text": "I've been going to Chompie's for years - I love deli's and this is one of my favorites. This is my first review for this location, where you can occasionally find me at lunchtime.    The variety of menu options to choose from at any Chompie's is mind-boggling. Every now and then I will try something new, but I usually end up ordering the Times Square New Yorker with pastrami because it's my favorite. Like most of their sandwiches, it arrives piled high with enough pastrami to satisfy the hungriest customer. It does not disappoint.   One day I got brave and ordered the Texas Longhorn burger. For the uninitiated, this beast is a half-pound burger topped with smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and coleslaw. I'm not a real big fan of topping burgers with other types of meats - but this thing was amazing! Tender, juicy and great flavor. I would recommend this to any burger fan, but do not - I repeat - do not, eat this if you have somewhere to be afterwards. This sandwich will take you down. I'm not kidding. Like you will need a nap to let your body recover. And probably some cholesterol medication.   On my last visit here our server brought us samples of the apple strudel, which was really good. I will definitely order this on a future visit.   Now, with the good comes the bad - and there is one issue here that I see I'm not alone in experiencing. SERVICE! At this location during the lunch hour, my co-workers and I have just sat at the table waiting for anyone to come take our drink/food order. On other occasions, the server is prompt and on top of everything - but it took an eternity for our food to arrive. Very inconsistent. It has reached a point where we now tell the server upon our arrival that we are in a hurry - just to get normal service.  The food here is amazing - I love this place. But they need to figure out their service issues here. I would have given them a 4-5 star review, but I'm not going to give them a pass on this. I'll be back again - let's see if they can address what myself and other reviewers clearly recognize as an issue.",

    "text": "I now firmly believe that yelp was created by someone who ate (or at least attempted) to ear here. 3 months ago my family came in and after 15-20 minutes without even being acknowledged,  we left, and I then yelped.  I was contacted by someone at Chompies who's important enough to man their yelp account, and told that my name was on a \"list\" and they'd \"make it right\" on my next visit. So,  here we are 3 months later and my daughter wanted a bagel - so against my better judgment,  we thought we'd give Chompies a chance to do what they previously promised to do, and make it right. Keep in mind we arrived at about 1:30 in the afternoon and the place was half-full at best. Low and behold though, we had a case of some serious dejavu! After 10 minutes of many waiters walking by but not stopping or saying a word to us -  I thought I'd go over to the bar area where they had a host, a waiter, and some girl with a name tag on but was sitting on an actual barstool, all having a great time. I told the host that we'd been there for 10 minutes and Yada Yada yada..and asked if there was a waiter that could assist. He said he get one for us, and another 5 minutes go by, still no service to speak of so we left.. again!! I was able to speak to a manager on the way out and voice my concern and she said she even remembered this happening to us the last time we were there. It boggles my mind how naturally it comes to practically everyone working there, that their customers don't matter. Well played Chompies,  well played.",

Maybe it was because we were there on a Thursday at 3:30pm so there wasn't much traffic, but signature Jewish Sliders we ordered came out in less than 15 minutes.  I found out about this place from the Man v Food episode and the sliders looked amazing online. Finally trying them myself I have to say they were pretty good but didn't live up to the hype, I would give them 3.5/5. The gravy sauce or ranch dressing is necessary for the slider otherwise it won't have too much flavor. The meat is cooked beautifully and fairly tender. The onion strings side were fantastic (4/5) and go really well with the ranch sauce. We also ordered one Western style slider just to try and I ended up liking that one more. We also got a mini carrot cake, which I would give a solid 5/5. The food + service and speediness which I would give  5/5 compels me to give this place 4/5 overall.",

    "text": "This was our 2nd or 3rd visit to this location and we won't be back. We went on Friday night and saw that they have an all you can eat fish and chips special. My husband asked the hostess what kind of fish it was, and she said, \"cod, I would guess.\" Strange that she would guess about what they are having for the special. We were seated right away and our server was nice. She took our drink orders and got the drinks quickly. She recommended the fish special saying it was great. I ordered half of a corned beef sandwich with fries and my husband ordered the fish. While we waited for our food, someone tried to serve us the food from 3 other tables. I could see how that would happen once, but 3 times!  My sandwich was fine. I ordered it lean, so it was a bit dry. Their fries are great - and they did not disappoint. The plate of fish and chips was heaping full. The fish looks like it's hand breaded as the breading was very puffy. But it was awful - the fish was really tough and nearly inedible.  My husband left more than half of it on his plate, and the server didn't notice or even ask us how things were. When she brought our credit card back for signature, I told her that the fish was really bad, and pretty much inedible. She said, \"i wish you had told me that before.\" That's all. She didn't even offer to share my complaint with the manager. As we left, the hostesses asked how our meal was and I again told them that the fish was terrible. They just kind of shrugged and said they were sorry - again, nothing was done to alert management or try to correct the bad impression left on us.   Their prices are high for a casual restaurant, so they need to really do something to impress you to keep your business. They are not doing that.  I'll probably go back for sliced meat at the deli and maybe some baked goods, but not to have a meal on location.",

    "text": "Wow. Massive Fail! Well, this is not surprising. Went to Chompies year's ago. Wasn't impressed. Stopped in today, to give it another try. WOW! We've been to a lot of restaurants, including some very exotic over seas. Amazingly enough, Chompies has managed a massive fail. Ordered pastrami, hard salami, with lettuce, tomato, pickles onions on sourdough bread. So, where do we start. The pickles... not on the sandwich, but rather on the side and shoved into foil. The pickles are so massively covered in brine, there is no resulting classic pickle flavor. Just salty. The sourdough bread. Kid's white bread has more flavor. Now, the tomato and lettuce. What tomato and lettuce? Oh that's right. One small leaf of lettuce smashed into the sandwich, with a paper-thin slice of tomato also smashed in. Now, to the good stuff. The pastrami and hard salami. The hard salami was fully flavored with staleness. The flavor of the meat was enough to strip it off the sandwich and throw it away... not knowing how old it was. And ah yes.. the pastrami. Have you ever had pastrami taste like perfumed soap? Well, we have and it was with this sandwich. Horrid, disgusting, Ohhhh... and lets not forget! As sandwich shops do, they insert a little toothpick with colored cellophane on the tops of them. Well, well, well, what did we find? The toothpicks were shoved in the sandwich so hard, they broke off into bits! We ended up slicing apart the entire section around the toothpick. Now we wait... to see how many splinters really end up in our teeth. Pathetic, frightening, stomach-turning garbage, all for a simple sub-style sandwich costing a whopping $19.00 !! Chompies = FAIL. Just added a photo so you can gather your own opinions. Tell us please, does that meat look good to you? And does the broken tooth picks look appetizing? Good luck to you if you choose to eat at any Chompies.",

    "text": "Typically I am not a fan of chain restaurants but I have to say that this place knows whats up. I appreciate their massive portions, specifically the pastrami/corned beef and rye sandwiches. They have a hay-uge selection of menu items which can be overwhelming but it also can be fun to see what you have not tried. I have never been to NYC so I cannot speak to the authenticity of both the ambiance or the food but its hard to find a good pastrami on rye and I would venture to say that theirs is pretty solid - also I think they offer something like 5 different types of rye bread. Breakfast is good, too. I had the Guanajuato Benedict and the avocado Hollandaise sauce was tasty as well as the chorizo. Staff is always friendly and accommodating and I have always had a pleasurable experience here. There is also a sweets counter, bread table, and manager specials happening if you do not care to stop in and eat at the restaurant. I think they also do to-go orders.",

Their Bobka french toast is so good but so sweet, so no longer something I can eat but I do think about it. If you want lunch get one of their pastrami sandwiches, their challah roll is the best.

It's time for lunch.  Nope. Definitely NOT Brooklyn.  NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.  Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.  There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, \"don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's\" casual, sit-down restaurant.   Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your \"I only eat healthy chick food\" waistline has a deathwish.  What a way to go, ho!  - fantastic soups of the day -  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token     offering of lettuce - sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast     hidden somewhere beneath - gravy, Gravy, GRAVY - pickles. On EVERYTHING. - French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your     table, or at least one very fat man. - attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)  The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad.   And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?

By \"breakfast\", I mean Chicken Fried Steak with Gravy, Eggs, Hash Browns (really good), and a blueberry bagel (choose the bagel here, it's awesome).  Our big worry was that we would end up late for our meeting after lunch, but they got us our food pretty quickly.  The Half Sandwich was pretty much the size of a Toddler's head. The meal in front of me nearly made me nod off in the aforementioned meeting, being so huge and delicious. That sausage gravy set the whole thing off, and the bagel ended up a nice dessert.  After that awesome meal, we ended up only a dollar over our 20 dollar Groupon (both went with waters), and got back in time for our nap... er... meeting.",

The hostess told my name for my husband and I, and we waited over 30 minutes for a table right in front of her stand. Finally, we asked her when we would be called after seeing she seated people coming in after us, and she said she called our name 20 minutes ago, which she certainly did not. That's not even the problem, as she wasn't even apologetic about it. Additionally, the crew at the deli can be a bit rude, especially with take out. You might have to wait a while to pay even if your order is hot and ready. They need a better system.",

Keep in mind that the manager had to come outside to tell us all.  She could have easily grabbed a cloth and done it in the amount of time it took to tell us.  So, if you want to eat at a table with bird poop on it, this is your place!",

Well this small error  caused a huge domino affect. Chompies order arrived after the promise delievery time, along with 2nd delievery.  Chompies didn't meet the expectations of having the meal correct and ready at the promised time. Also Chompies tablet was missing so they had to get the customers order from me the driver.

    "text": "Hankering for Jewish deli food (as opposed to Italian deli, German deli, Polish deli, etc), my friend and I settled on Chompie's Deli for lunch today. We were attracted by the huge variety of food choices on the menu online. This location is across the street from the Chandler Fashion Mall. We were seated right away.  I had the soup and slider combo ($8.99). I chose the chicken noodle soup (average) and two Jewish sliders (excellent). The sliders were stuffed with tender beef brisket, cheese and a potato pancake on Challah bread rolls (also excellent). There were sides of a creamy cole slaw and brown gravy. I can't say the gravy added anything to the sandwich, so I ate one sandwich without the gravy and took the other sandwich home.  My friend had the corned beef Reuben mile high sandwich with cole slaw and fries ($14.99) and was only able to eat half of the meal and took the rest home. She loved the flavors, but found the mountain of meat daunting to eat. She ended up attacking it with knife and fork.   When the server asked us if we would like some dessert we both looked at him like he was crazy since we both stuffed with just half the lunch. The dessert case was within eye shot and looked tempting, but alas no room left in the tummy for those temptations.  The theme of the food, decor, and menu seems to be New York City (I supposed because it hosts a plethora of Jewish delis). The seating is a little crowded, but the place seems clean. Service was good, but not very speedy (OK for this visit since we were not in a rush). Parking is plentiful and we found a spot close to the door. We would recommend this Chompie's deli and will likely return in the future.",

We ordered a mango flavor drink and it was decent. The huge chuck of ice makes it hard for me to drink through the small straw. We also ordered a cheese cake as well as Brooklyn 7 layer of chocolate cake. If you like the taste of sugar (I mean, nothing but sugar), you might like these dessert.

My plate was hot (mysteries of he AC workings, I guess ACs pick and choose what to air condition) and the other 2 plates cold.  2 of 3 plates sent back for being cold and eggs raw. Bald manager came out and was nice about it. Nice guy. Second order came out, and hollandaise on one plate was gross and thick and oh yeah, food cold. Complained to a different manager who rudely asked, \"What do you want me to do about it? It all came out of the pot that way.\" Asked if he could take it off the bill and just charge for the egg that was eaten.  Waitress came over and explained that the bill was discounted, then when questioned said we could just see the bill (she had no clue). Turned out they took the one meal off.  Overall attitude. Place is going waaay down in customer service. We used to eat there once a week and now, it's been more difficult to justify the return each time.  On the plus side, I had pumpkin cranberry pancakes and they were excellent and weirdly enough HOT the entire meal. Like I said, the AC must have avoided my plate and skipped to the others'.",

It was my worst meal in a long, long time.   Our server asked if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, which is odd considering the menu is 6 pages long. Tip one: don't eat at a restaurant that has a big menu because it means they don't do anything well.   I ordered the Biltmore Benedict with a potato latke side. The Benedict was SALTY. It was salt-lick salty. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. The latke was a tasteless potato puck, only harder.   I guess it's partly my fault because if I had wanted an \"authentic New York Deli,\" I should have gone to New York. My bad.   Tip two: don't ever go to Chompie's.",

To the left is a hostess podium where they make you wait a little while-- really for no reason as you can see open tables behind them. Maybe they just wanted us to take in the fabulousness of the deli area some more and get impressed.  We were seated in about ten minutes. Not the cleanest area, but the service people were nice and we liked the pickles.  About ten minutes after ordering, food came.  My daughter was a big fan of the hamburger.  My wife liked her sandwich and fried.  The pastrami sandwich was good, though I admit I had to use a fork and knife because bread simply lacks the structural integrity to handle so much meat.    The blintz (sp?) was pretty yummy.  Cookies were dry.  Paying the bill was quick and pleasant.",

Their food is consistently good and the portions are very large, probably too large for most. They could probably make them smaller and knock a couple of bucks off the price. Their menu is big but if you pay attention it is a variety of things made with the same staples. For example, I come here for the corn beef and hash (delicious! this isn't the crap that comes in a can) and the menu lists the same dish served several different ways.  Great food and good service. The bagels can't be beat (it must be the water).",

We were seated within minutes and told that our waiter would be over in a minute and then the Manager TJ came over and greeted us and asked if we wanted to order any drinks. Our waiter came over greeted us, and took our orders. Since it was close to lunch I had the Motown. Pastrami Stacked high, never can eat the whole thing anymore so I get to have it for dinner too. My wife had breakfast and it was all good. Food came hot, my potatoes were hot even when I was putting some into my to go box. Very Friendly staff, very good food. It's a little bit far away, wish that they had one closer to where I live but I would probably live there. If you have not tried Chompies, you are missing out. They have an on site bakery also with many cookies and breads that I grew up eating back in NY. Again, I really like this location. I'm not sure that I give all of the other locations a five rating. I also want to mention that Darryl our waiter, was great!!",

They are not the same.  They must be made somewhere differently, because they taste nothing like the ones from the actual restaurant. They also have fantastic cream cheese varieties. We get the veggie one often but have also tried the plain, and chive and are all really good and fresh. If you are going to eat there, expect a wait if it is a prime time, and super friendly service. I would recommend breakfast fare (it's all good!) or if it is lunch time, go for the typical Jewish deli stuff like matzo ball soup (so good!) or a reuben sandwich. Those items really stick out as special to me, and are not easy to find here in Arizona. It is a great place where you can get whatever you are craving and everything is good. They give the kids a cookie with their meal which my kids totally appreciate.  Not fast though, be patient! Also, you can order egg sandwiches from the bagel area and they are delicious.  Gives me a little taste of the east coast which I love.",

If I want to indulge for breakfast, I'll get the corned beef hash, which is made in house and is great!   I get their matzoh ball soup anytime I am sick or if I'm missing my mom's cooking. Their sandwiches are delicious and outrageously large, and I love their house-made chips. The Jewish sliders are so yummy, definitely a guilty pleasure. My one disappointment was coming here for a pre-fixe Passover dinner one year - the food was all mediocre and just made me more homesick for a good holiday meal.

    "text": "My son's Bagel came burnt and it was obvious that they had tried to scraped off the burnt part with the knife, but it was still clearly black on most of the surface.  When you go to a bagel place you expect a good bagel and it surprised me that they even survived it to him.  Well mistakes happen and that is not the reason for the 1 star.  the reason for 1 star was the response I received.  It was near closing time when the food arrived and they said that all of the bagels had been put away so they could not replace it.  The waitress offered a discount of $2 off the bagel part of my son's mean (his meal was $12 total).  He did eat the rest, but that is because he was Hungary and the rest of us were started eating.  It was not about the money, but I was not happy with them serving him a burnt bagel, being unwilling to get a new bagel for him in the back and only offering $2 off so I asked for the manager.  The manager said she would comp the meal, but when the bill came it was only the $2 off.  I paid the bill and give a less than normal tip, but its really disappointing that they would not either (a) give him the bagel that he wanted (meaning getting the put away bagels out for him), or (b) comp the whole meal.  This really took away from what was a nice evening with the family.  The food was actually pretty good, but with service like this we will not be back.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is a great expression to describe this location. Not all Chompie's are created equal - our waitress was nice, but my hubby ordered the \"tuna melt\" but it came with no cheese, so it was more like a tuna....hm. what do you call that? He also ordered an egg cream, but they were out of that - not a big deal, but my hot chocolate didn't come with the whipped cream it was supposed to come with, so that was lame.  I ordered 2 original pancakes {can't really mess that up} and I got eggs on the side, with melted cheddar cheese. They have  DELICIOUS syrup and gave me as much as I needed.  If you end up dining at this location, just stay on top of your order. You might need to ask if they are even carrying what you want, before you order it.",

    "text": "Stay away from Chompie's if you're at all trying to 'watch what you eat'.. from the time you walk in and are greeted by the vast display of goodies and pastries.. to the extensive menu that offers everything from all-day breakfast dishes like challah roll french toast to mile high sandwiches, you will likely be un-successful in ordering, much less consuming something that is figure friendly.    Well I have been eating waaay too many salads this month, so I was really hard up for some meat and some tasty animal fat... wasn't wanting to go all out, but I definitely wanted a non-salad meal, heavy with protein & animal fat.  I didn't exactly pick this place (it was more of a group decision), but it would have to do.    Our party of 4 got seated quickly during prime Fri lunch time and commenced to read the literary novel that is their 15 page menu (ok, maybe more like 8)...  'I want some meat, a big ass hunk of meat... ooh, there's a mile-high pastrami... nah.. OOoh, how bout sliders?.. nah, too much bread..  fish?...ooh, they have all-you-can-eat fish & chips today???... FOCUS April! you're looking for MEAT... alright... maybe a burger?.. yeah.. gluten free bread?.. hmm.. not bad.. why not?.. oh yeah, AND with BACON on it.. and some cheese!'  There! I had gone through all my meat-options on the menu and settled on a huge bacon cheese-burger with a Gluten-Free bun and side of sweet potatoes.    When the order came up, it was ginormous!  Actually, ALL our orders were huge plates, plentiful with fries and those who got mile-highs were also stacked high with sandwich meat.  We all walked out stuffed and some with to-go boxes.  I tried the fish & chips and it was decent (not better than the fish I've had at FIbbers, but decent).  I wasn't underwhelmed with my Gluten-free bun.  It was tall and had a small diameter (like a muffin), so it was very awkward to eat it as the 'bun' when the huge diamater meat patty hung over... so I just removed it and had the patty, bacon, and cheese solo.. and of course some fries.  BTW, their fries were, across the plates at our table, soggy and not crisp (my table partners didn't like that, but I love soggy fries, so I can't complain.. apparently, soggy is not the popular vote for fries).  All in all: quick seating at lunch time, friendly waitress did her job, manager came by to great us, food was huge portions, soggy fries, odd GF bun, great selection of deserts, overwhelming lunch menu... immediate lunch food coma.",

My husband had the turkey dinner, so delicious.  Real white meat turkey, not a turkey roll like a lot of places do and the stuffing was delicious also.  The gravy was real (I know good gravy, I love gravy) this gravy was not from a can and it had bits of turkey in it, very flavorful. We also had the onion rings with their dipping sauce, it reminded me a bit of Outback blooming onion and sauce, defiantly homemade, would have that again. Looking forward to going back for another item on the menu.",

    "text": "I've been to this location about a gazillion times for lunch.  It's one of the closest-to-authentic NY Style Jewish delis in Arizona.  Plus... their 1/2 sandwich and soup special is a great deal!  FOOD: Get their matzo ball soup.  It is delicious.  I also love any of their sliders, their turkey sandwiches, their corned beef... It's all good.  I get all my sandwiches on either seedless rye or on challah.  Yum.  Also... they serve both kosher and half-sour pickles.  I am not a pickle fan, but their half-sours are ADDICTIVE.  I could make a whole meal out of them if my blood pressure would forgive me.  Salty goodness - yum!  They also have daily specials like Fish Fry Fridays (I believe it is after 4).  Check their website for details.  SERVICE: David is THE BEST server at Chompie's.  He remembers me and DD every time we stop in.  Even if we are not seated in his section, he stops by to say hello.  This kind of service is what brings us back to Chompie's again and again.  He also gives DD the best cookies with her meal.  VALUE: It's excellent.  Kids eat free (1 per adult entree purchased) on Mondays and Tuesdays.  They get a generous sized meal and can choose from about 15 or so meals.  You do have to pay for a drink, but it is well-worth it.   You know what?  I think I might pull my daughter out of preschool early today and take her for lunch.  I'm hungry!  ;)",

The home fries are always soggy, and they eggs always runny. Their portions are so large, I'm not surprise that they are not cooked properly.  They are always packed, and seem overwhelmed by the amount of guests they have seated. The heavy traffic makes for bathrooms that seem like they should be at a street festival or state fair.  I recommend grabbing your baked goods or bagels and heading home to enjoy them...far from the chaos and grime.",

From the greeting as we walked in to the walk out the door. The atmosphere was so dull, my food was warm not hot, the service was slow, there was no attempt to make for a great visit. Everyone seemed to be so disconnected. We didn't receive silverware when we sat down and actually had to get up and get it from a station set up on a table next to use for servers to roll silverware. We also saw other tables doing that too... The worst part about the visit was the manager's actions. He was very short when we arrived. We never saw him talking to tables. And on top of that, in the middle of our service he was in our view while outside smoking a cigarette and plying on his phone in the front of the restaurant.  Like I said, we'll stick to one in Tempe after that.",

She was very understanding and says \" we just sprayed for them yesterday\".  Ugh. . So disgusting. Why are they open then? She took 20% off our bill (which I think it should have been free).

I walk in and immediately am overwhelmed with their enormous selection of baked goods. We decided to stay and eat so as I was looking through their large selectioned menu and opted not to get a bagel but pancakes instead. Not sure why, I should have stuck with just a bagel but nooooooo the fat girl wanted strawberry shortcake  pancakes instead....well nothing to brag home about. They werent bad but they werent the greatest either.  Large menu with lots of breakfast itrms and lunches, I will try this place again BUT probably stick with a bagel or breakfast item or even their case out front for a goody to take home ....There lunch menu wouldnt bring me back there.  But the service was fast, very packed and still manged to get everyone in and out in a quick manner. Our waitress was friendly too.",

First of all,  people behind the bakery counter pretend like you don't exist. They will go to great lengths to seem like they're busy, just so they don't have to help you. On top of that, when they do decide to help someone, they just pick a random person out of the crowd, not who got their first. Second, they are always out of whole cake. I like to buy a cake now and then from them for occasions, but I am better off just going to the Scottsdale location at this point. Third, they are unclean. I watched a chick lick her fingers and then handle my food; that is disgusting. Finally, their pastries don't taste the same as other Chompie's and the chocolate rugelach is always burned. I will never come back to this rude and disgusting place!",

They have a GF Friendly Menu, and yes it does even say the kitchen CAN CROSS-CONTAMINATE...which we all know is a risk, but I got so excited to see GF waffles, I just had to try them.  Sadly, within 10min of eating the quite delicious, supposed GF, waffles I had to run to the bathroom & lots my food in a public bathroom (NOT a fun experience).    The truly disheartening part was how things were then handled by Management...  As I exited the bathroom with a \"flushed\" face & pain in my abdomen my waiter saw me & asked if I was ok...I told him no, as I had just tossed my cookies in the bathroom & suspected the GF waffles to not be so GF!   I returned to my table where my friends were waiting & said we needed to leave as I was ill... They had already paid the bill.  Then as we are exiting the Manager stops me to let me know the GF waffle iron is by itself & not used otherwise.  I graciously tried to say \"things happen\" & asked they watch more carefully...    NEVER did the Manager offer any consideration in the form of a partial refund, a gift certificate to come back, ANYthing that would try to retain me as a customer!!  I understand food allergies are hard to deal with, but the lack of effort by the Manager this Saturday morning was laughable.    I will not be back & caution ANY GLUTEN FREE peeps to steer clear!",

My wife and I have been coming here almost every week for 10 years now, but last night was our last visit. Once again, the wait staff was completely new. Gone are the old days when we knew the names of our servers and they knew us too (David, Jey, Amanda, Jessica, Zach). So last night, service was slow even though the place was only half full. Other customers were complaining and the servers were saying that they were using a new computer system to track the loyalty points and it was not working. I wasn't buying it because the slow service has become the trend. Again, the servers are doing the best they can. They're just new and overworked. As a result, when we did finally get our food, it was almost cold. Our server did apologize on the wait, even though we did not mention it.  We will be searching for a new hangout. Chompies of Chandler has become a good candidate for next season's Kitchen Nightmares.",

Happy to be getting up early and getting some b-fast with my BF and even more excited to be getting out of our typical 5 mile radius.  Trying a new place was the cherry on top!  Chompie's menu is gigantic and I was only looking at breakfast.  So much to choose from, I almost felt lost.  Pulled my typical move of narrowing it down to two or three and ask the server.  He recommended the Athens Skillet (sauteed spinach, artichokes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, tomato, feta, and jack cheese topped with two eggs and served over potatoes). I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but decided I could take it home to enjoy tomorrow.  Three things made this experience not my favorite, mostly my own fault and having nothing to do with Chompie's.  1) Something was off with Google Maps, so I was not able to 'check-in' using the Yelp app, it said I was a mile away.  Bummer.  2) Attempting to take that first bite of my delicious skillet, I cut into the egg with my fork and received a explosion of yolk on my shirt and white shorts.  Ugh!  3) When leaving the table, I left my huge box of leftovers sitting on the table.  *tear*  What can we all learn from my mishaps?  1) If you choose to eat your egg yolk runny, pierce it softly before diving in or maybe use your had to cover much like squeezing a lemon into a drink.  2) Put your leftovers somewhere that you have to take them to get out of the booth, maybe in your lap?  So, while I wasn't happy when I got home from Chompie's, I am still excited to return and do it right this time!",

Since we have family in town, we decided to take them here the other night so they could sample all of the awesome.   We went for dinner around 6:30p on Saturday night and I was moderately surprised to see that they were quite slow for the time of night. We were promptly seated by a very bubbly hostess. Our waiter came by shortly later and was equally friendly. There were 3 adults and 2 children in our party and we split 2 meals between us. The meals are HUGE!!! We ended up with leftover after sharing the 2 meals 5 ways!!!  We ordered the Jewish sliders and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Both were very good, but the Jewish sliders were REALLY something special. My husband is Jewish and was raised eating his grandmothers authentic Jewish cooking. He said that the sliders taste just like something his grandmother used to make.  Our server was very responsive and anticipated refills that were needed. The meal seemed to take longer to make then I anticipated considering how slow they were. Since we didn't have anything else going on we didn't mind the wait.   Bottom line:  * Food is awesome and authentic to NY and the Jewish style cooking. * Not a great place to go if you are in a rush  We will definitely be returning to Chompies for more of their Jewish sliders in the near future!",

I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.  Prices are decent, decor is cool and the bakery walking in/out is amazing.

    "text": "This was my first time in a Chompie's and first impressions are lasting impressions for me. Let me break this down for you...  We entered the restaurant and it was very busy but we didn't have to wait long to be seated and we did get a nice booth. The menu is vast that's the only way I could put it for my first time there I was just overwhelmed by the choice's they offered. I ended up getting the Cajun Chicken, my grandmother had a Meatloaf sandwich both came with potato fries. My Cajun Chicken which was supposed to be HOT was delicious but it was less than mild. My grandmother said her meatloaf wasn't very flavor full, I didn't try it but I would take her word for it. The restaurant was very loud and my grandmother is 80 years old so it was difficult for her to converse with me.   The portions are huge neither of us were able to finish our plates, I personally don't care for giant portions. You will be assaulted with food at every turn in this place which makes sensible choices difficult. Chompies, honestly, it reminded me of an upscale Denny's. Better food, but atmosphere was exactly the same... If you've ever been in a typical Denny's you'll know exactly what that comparison means. Our server wasn't the best, we felt neglected at times and she was very pushy for us to hurry and place our order.   Overall, my first impression of Chompies was not a good one and I'm still on the fence about weather or not I would return.",

She was rude to the people at the table who ordered water, was awkwardly telling us it was \"weird\" that we liked our appetizer because others didn't, and explained that even though they advertise \"rare\" roast beef, it all depends on the cut...what???

Of course it does cut into my popcorn money, but a far better value.   I love the Matzo Ball Soup. I have tried most everything but the one thing that stands out high on my list is the mile high sandwiches. The hot pastrami is great. I love love love the coleslaw and pickles.   Chompie's is the best deli around. I love that they have special dinners for those special holidays of the Jewish faith. \"Metzuyan\"",

    "text": "So. I used to be a regular customer and had Dave was my waiter. I would wait 30 minutes just to be seated with him, why you might wonder? Well let's talk... firstly he was a genuinely friendly person that became part of our family every time we ate there. He cared that our food came out correct the first time, loved my grand kids and treated them as his own, to which they still ask about him.  We have not gone back since that Saturday over a year ago when I asked to sit with Dave and the girl said he wasn't in today? I was perplexed, as this was a Saturday and busy and he was always there, to which I stated what day was he coming in, and was told not anymore, they let him go!  I was genuinely saddened, as was my entire family to find out that he was no longer a server there, as was many other long timers who were also gone?  Dave was the best waiter, and made all of us, even my picky Jewish mom from Boca... feel at home like in a Brooklyn diner! Chompies food is sub-par but we only went there for Dave, so for them to let go of the best waiter they had, that brought so many customers who enjoyed him, and put up with the food, is beyond me! Also, Dave was such a good waiter that he even made you feel like you had a friend to eat with, when at times I would eat breakfast alone after a good hike.. I miss those days with Dave.",

I loved how there were several choices of bread and cheeses you could choose from. I had mine with Rye and Havarti it was sooooo delicious! I choose Cole Slaw for the side selection I was kind of disappointed about it's small size. I also ordered sweet potato fries, they were okay but I hate that they tasted like they were factory cut. I bought a piece of Red Velvet cake to-go it was okay, I like the Cheesecake factory Red Velvet better. Overall good experience I'll be back. Oh yeah I almost forgot, I ordered a Strawberry shake and they were out of the syrup they normally use to make them, so the manager actually made me one out of fresh strawberries and it was great! My waiter couldn't have been any friendlier either.",

    "text": "They have really good baked potato soup, and also really good scrambled eggs and waffle with strawberries and whipped cream.  if you are Polish and see that they have pierogi on the menu, don't get your hopes up--this is a Jewish Deli and the pierogis are overdone and dry and don't taste at all like you would expect.   Same if you are Mexican and get the Albondigas soup. Not dry, but definitely an odd flavor.  They do have some sort of a \"boot camp\" breakfast menu. I haven't tried anything on there at all.   The lemon bars were good the first time we went, but not the 2nd; I was told it's hit or miss with the taste of those.  It's a cute restaurant chain in AZ with 4, I think, locations, and a NY Deli-type theme. There is graffiti, license plates from NY, sports pix, etc all over the walls as decoration.  Mostly we haven't gotten good service here. It's been a pleasant surprise when we have.  And if you go on a Sunday around noonish, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating and it's normally a 25 to 40 min wait.  And if you have kids? The waitresses mostly forget to bring the cookie they get as part of their meal at the end. I didn't know about it and was surprised, and asked what was that for? She said, it's part of the kids' meal.   oh, and if you go to the Tempe location? the manager not only doesn't care, but he can't read the handwriting of the ppl taking your name down, calls the wrong name, passes you up, and then when you ask why it's been longer than they said and ppl who came in after you are getting seated, he gives you an attitide and said he called your name repeatedly. We were sitting right there--we went nowhere, including to their bathroom, while we waited.  Not sure if he whispered my name into someone else's ear, but I'm not deaf. I heard everyone else's name being called, including \"Jake\" when there was no Jake. I'm pretty sure I was Jake that day, but they denied it and said there was definitely a Jake. Funny I saw no one answering them when they repeatedly called Jake and moved on to the next person on the list.  And it's really a tight squeeze in the Tempe location; the tables/booths seem a bit too close together, especially if you have a baby and need to use a high-chair.",

One of my favorite choices is the Jewish sliders they are served on a soft roll with a thick potato pancake and juicy sliced beef then topped with cheese a a drizzle of gravy. Beware though these bad boys pack a punch in your stomach you get three to an order and I am lucky if I can eat one and half. They are super filling and be sure to upgrade to the fried onion strings and you wont regret. John likes the corned beef and pastrami sandwich (not really for my tastes). They always give you a generous portion of meat that you can barely taste the bread itself lol. Overall I think this is a great lunch spot and the service is always great.",

My server greeted me right away.   My lunch arrived in seven mins. I guess pickles are a big thing cuz each party received a tray of dill spears. I never liked them so they went ignored. My bagel sandwich was served open faced on an 'everything' bagel.   There was plenty of meat on the sandwich, along with melted cheese and a hint of mustard (more at the table). The flavors were all there but it was a very difficult sandwich to eat. Even open-faced with a knife and fork, it kept falling apart. I think the bagel was over grilled. I'll try a different dish next time.",

    "text": "We used to come here all the time. Recently, the menu must have changed, which is sad because now it seems like they have less. Not just the quantity of the menu, but the quality of the food has changed as well!  I ordered 4 eggs over easy, turkey sausage, latke pancake, and rye bread. The eggs were burnt badly around the edges, so I had a nice crunch while eating over easy eggs... The turkey sausage was so salty, it was as if they threw the patty in a salt filled bag, shook it up, then dumped more salt in it, and while cooking, poured another cup of salt over the sausage just for good measure.  I also had the pleasure of finding a big honkin' onion in my eggs randomly. I dislike onions and sure didn't order any...  I used to get this meal all the time when I came here. The turkey sausage is a different recipe, that's for sure. Couple that with zero refills (it wasn't a busy day at all. It was a late dinner on a tuesday!).  This place just isn't with it anymore... sad... I loved coming here.",

Ordered soup and sandwich. Got their hot pastrami and Matzah ball soup. Yes the Matzah ball soup was good. Huge Matzah ball loaded with flavor. Wonderful broth and some noodles.  The hot pastrami sandwich was loaded but came cold.  Thought that was odd.  So I asked about that afterwards. I asked what hot meant?  Was it hot mustard?  Was it hot steamed pastrami?  Which was it because the sandwich possessed none of this things. I found out the pastrami was suppose to be hot. Management took $7 off the bill.    This place is busy and features many baked items and other items to take with you (deli).  Looked so good. Too bad we were traveling.   The bathrooms were not clean. Walls were dirty and the bathroom was not cleaned. Needs painting and bleaching.",

We actually stopped in on a Sunday and they were so crowded (I would have waited, but I was too hungry), that we came back on Tuesday. It was lovely because nobody was there and we got the whole dining area to ourselves. But the best part was just the food. The service was pretty good to say a little more.  I had trouble choosing because the menu is quite extensive, but I finally chose an artichoke spinach omelette with a bagel on the side. I was in bagel heaven. My friends both had sandwiches. My partner had the beef brisket and said it was to die for. My girlfriend had a pastrami. It was piled so high she wasn't sure how she was going to add her mouth around it. It was flavored just right and she said it was amazing. They also bring a little plate of pickles to put in the middle of the table. The cool thing was there was several varieties.   Lately I have been out for breakfast or brunch several times and this is the best omelette I think I've had in a long time. It had succulent artichokes, lots of spinach and just a really good fresh flavor with spice. My bagel was toasted and buttered. Even when I was almost full I completely finished it it was so crunchy and chewy. I live in Tucson and I haven't been able to get my bagel craving satisfied. This one did it for me. I'll be back for sure! In fact, We all left quite satisfied.",

It's a Jewish deli and bakery and somehow my sister convinced me to order the turkey dinner instead of a Reuben sandwich, which they are known for   The chicken tortilla soup was very hearty with big chunks of chicken and fried tortillas. There were also chunks of potato and onion. I'm a huge soup fan, even if it's 105 in Phoenix, and this was definitely tasty    The turkey dinner was very dry. Since it took a while for the food to come out, I think it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The sauteed spinach was delicious but I enjoyed the latkes better, very crispy with moist inside and flavored with onion and garlic.  The stuffing was dry and the gravy needed some spices.   My sisters corned beef and cabbage was outstanding!  The meat was so tender and melted like butter. I should have stuck with the Jewish food.",

Waiter was right there to take drink and food order.  So I'm thinking wooooo hoooo they've fixed up their act.  Nope, not so much.  Food took 35+ minutes to come out.  Now we didn't order anything elaborate.  Bread, meat, bread.  Not really a complex thing to put together.  But nooooooooooo.  They managed to turn two sandwiches into a 35+ minute wait.  Good news, sandwiches (pastrami) were good.  Bad news, not good enough to justify the wait.  Also, they have wedge fries, just a personal thing, but not my thing.  Most likely will be 4 or more years between today and my next visit.  Unless of course their systemic inability to run a restaurant finally pushes them out of business.",

For breakfast, there are two items I get depending on what I'm craving. If I'm craving something sweet, I get the stuffed French Toast which is stuffed with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam then deep fried. Unmatched! If I want something salty, I order the corn beef hash with two eggs. It's satisfying and delicious. For lunch/dinner I can go for the Borenstein burger with bacon and sweet potato fries or the traditional Jewish sliders. Matzo ball soup is great, too. For dessert, I'll go for their 7 layer cake, brownie, or black and white cookie. Nom nom nom.",

The Chandler location appears old, dated, dirty and not to mention service slow. It took a bit of time for the server to even come to our table with menus and then take our order. I think we were the forgotten child while waiting and waiting for our food, while it seemed other tables were getting their food before us even after they sat after us.  Missing my craving for Chopped liver, I ordered the appetizer portion that came with Bagel Chips and a slice of Onion. My friend ordered the Pastrami on Rye which was good, though the sandwich size was not piled high like the Scottsdale location serves. My Chopped Liver was a little too sweet for my taste which I never had that in the Scottsdale either.  Chandler location, service slow, kitchen slow, food OK, atmosphere: old, and dirty. Go to the Scottsdale location, I'm a 4 Star fan there!",

When placing an order on the phone for a pick up order for lunch: 1) be sure you are speaking with someone familiar with the menu. 2) ask that the order be read back to you so that you can correct any misconceptions of what you want. 3) when you arrive to pick up your order and pay, always, always check every detail of your order to be sure that it is correct. 4) always pay with a credit card when picking up a to go order. be sure you have a receipt when you leave, just in case something is not right. 5) Now you will be prepared to get a credit on your order should you get all the way home and your lunch is not right.  And so this is the way it went when I picked up an order today, once I got it home my lunch was so wrong I threw it out and had nothing. Wrong sandwich, wrong side order.  On a lighter note my bill did go from $29 to $16 so there's that.",

The sandwich used to be huge, so huge that I only got a half sandwich (and I can put away half a pizza and a dozen wings).  Now, it's small, And they serve the fries in this little, white fruit cup. Weird, and small. This the only reason I didn't do a 4th star.  The bakery is good, too. They have tons of good stuff there.",

I grew up on the original Chompie's, next to the bowling alley on Shea, and I hate to say that out of all 3 trips to the Frye location I have endured, all have had very poor service and my food has come out wrong each time.  Order eggs over medium, get scrambled...order bacon extra crispy, get limp barely cooked bacon...order garlic bagel, get onion...hashbrowns cooked lightly, get them almost burnt...order bagel lightly toasted, get burnt bagel....seriously, a server has to have some serious chutzpah to serve a burnt bagel!  Each time I went it was 1030-1100 on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Each time I waited almost 10 minutes after being seated for my server to show up.  Thank goodness for the busser/water guy!  No manager to be found.  When asked to take my food back and correct it, it wasa big deal.    Lovey and the family would be very disappointed to know this was how a customer was being treated in their family's well established restaurant.",

That being said, they went above and beyond to show us just how delicious their food was, and how accommodating and friendly they were. I was able to sample three of their sliders, and have to say the corned beef as to die for. All their deserts and cookies were excellent. But what stood out the most for me was the bagels. I'm not a big bagel person myself but their strawberry bagels are one of the best things I've had the pleasure of devouring. I could pretty much eat those for 1000 years.   Highly recommend this place if you want some great comfort deli food. :)",

We asked our server for his recommendations and he gave us an excellent overview of what options we could choose from depending on what type of meal we were hungry for (breakfast, lunch, dinner, sandwiches vs plates, etc.) He also brought us a small plate with a few slices of different meats for us to sample. We opted for the Jewish sliders and the New Jersey sliders. Each plate came with three sandwiches and we each managed two and took the remaining sandwiches home. We didn't have any of the corned beef but tried a sample and it was amazing! We ultimately opted for the pastrami, which was also excellent! We were also thrilled with the service; Jay did such a good job I asked to speak to the manager to compliment him in his excellent service.   Overall, it was an excellent experience. We are new to the area and appreciated the attentiveness of our server and the quality (and quantity!) of food. We will return!",

    "text": "Coming from a Native New Yorker...  My girlfriend wanted to surprise me with the start of my birthday week so she planned a surprise visit to Chompie's Deli. She had this on the agenda for some time and was so excited to have finally been able to put it in a day out to the mall.   I was so excited when we pulled up because she had raved about this place and being I am from New York/ Staten Island, we were both so excited about this outing.   I will say I am a New York critic to places that say they are \"New York\" so please understand my point of view. If you say your place is based on a place, it should be don't you think? I don't think places should make money off of s theme unless they are True to it.  We don't go out to eat much so the place has to be good for us to go.  My first impression was great with the bakery display of all the \"goods\". I wanted to sink my teeth into \"one of each\" but as soon as the young lady behind the counter spoke, we were disappointed. She lacked any kind of confidence,  happiness or maybe a smile, knowledge of the products or history of this place. I get we all have our days of not doing so good but I could tell this was her personality each day. That was the first impression of the people that worked there. We shrugged it off and went about ordering a corn beef sandwich, fries, cold slaw and pickle (or course). We ordered it to go and was told that we they would let us know when the order was ready. That never happened so I went up there to see if it was ready and they looked at me like \"yes\"? I shrugged it off, took the food and went and sat down. We thought it would be quicker to get an order to go verses \"in\" dining but we were wrong. We should have just ordered it \"in\" and maybe they would know we were here?  We proceeded to share this meal and I will say - the entire meal was great tasting however if I combined the poor service and the over priced meal - I don't need to return again.   A place of business should never Always be in business just for the money and that's what I felt here. It should be about customer service, quality and price. This place didn't have all of that for me. I will say they pack a very good meal but  shouldn't it be about the over all experience? I feel it should be. I can go anywhere and just get something to eat. I don't mind paying a bit more if I have everything I want in a place. If I'm not treated well at a restaurant, I just assume stay home. We as customers pay for empoyee's to work correct? We pay their wages so I feel if we are doing that, we should get great customer service. They also get a tip that should be worked for, never assumed.   PS I also bought 2 poppy bagels for our breakfast in the morning and I don't need to buy them again either. This was not a New York bagel. I couldn't even taste the poppy seeds.  PSS If I would have read reviews before going, I would have never gone seeing a review with a cockroach!!! Yuck!! I was pretty disappointed. No need for a revisit.",

It's not quite like a real East-Coast deli, but close enough that most folks won't know the difference.  The menu is about a mile long, as is traditional for a deli.  The food was pretty good.  Our server was a little new, and I think a little confused.  But that's more a training issue than a service issue.  They did a nice job and I was satisfied.  I'd been going through \"pastrami withdrawl\" - had the mile-high.  It was good.  I also had the split pea soup and got to try the mushroom barley.

Anyway, we were told 20 minutes to be seated it was about 10 at most.  Nice location we were seated and David was our server.  He was humorous and we even joked about some dishes that crashed in the kitchen of which everybody heard.  My husband and I both ordered the Chorizo and cheese omelet which was wonderful but AGAIN a little skimpy on the meat for the price.  I found the coffee to be excellent and I exchanged my potatoes for a jalapeno and cheese bagel of which was genius in my opinion.    So, dinner was ok, a little pricey but breakfast was pricey as well, but even more worth it.",

She was very nice to others refilling personal cups with coffee and making small talk. Will make sure if I go back not to sit in her area",

    "text": "So I have been to all of the other Chompie's, and I must say that this one is the nicest looking one. I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good.   Also, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)",

    "text": "I've gone to Chompie's for years and have been coming to the Chandler location for about three years now. The food is usually pretty good. The service is really hit-or-miss, but I guess that can be expected from a lot of restaurants. My dad was in town on Memorial Day and wanted a skillet, so I suggested we go to Chompie's because their food is pretty good.   The first odd thing that happened is the hostess telling us \"_____ will be your server, and he's REALLY great.\" We were all a bit confused by that because we'd never heard a hostess brag about the server before. Anyway. The server comes up to us and we tell him we're ready to order. He tells us that he can only take our drink order right now and he's going to take the order of the table behind us. We order our iced teas and he tells us, \"Just so you know, guys, we've got a lot of people it's pretty busy here today, okay?\" Despite there being empty tables around us, we went with it. Ten minutes later our drinks come out and we order the food, and again, he tells us \"It's going to be a while because we're super busy, but I'll be sure to keep your drinks refilled.\" Sure, okay. Within 10 minutes we all had empty glasses. We watched him walk right by our table at least five times--one of the times he even bumped into me and apologized! I thought for sure that would get his attention but I guess not. Ten more minutes pass and as he walks by I try to get his attention for more tea, but I'm ignored. About forty minutes after we ordered the table behind us gets their food (the ones he had to help before taking our order). We wait fifteen minutes (still no refills) until someone else runs our food out to us, and it's ice cold. By this point we'd realized the hostess was probably playing a sick joke on us because she knew he was the worst sever ever.  Anyway, we're waiting for him to come to our table so we can pay for the drinks and leave, but he ignores us some more. He's standing at the table behind us and the guests ask how he's doing today, and he proceeds to complaint to them about how miserable he is to be working and how people are pissing him off. Then he walks right past us again and goes to the kitchen. At this point we just told the manager and left, who didn't even ask us to pay for the iced teas. I don't know why they'd let someone with such a horrible attitude even be on the floor. That experience really killed it for me and I don't think I'll be coming back.",

My husband got a chicken sand which that he said was the best he has ever had and he is super hard to please.  It had jalepeno cheese and onion strings on it.

I said, \"I ordered a burger.\" The waitress replied, \"It's a chicken burger.\" Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.  The service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.  On the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.  Oh, and on that check was printed, \"Baja Chicken Sandwich.\" I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.  I said burger.",

No one in Arizona makes bagels, or bialys or seeded rye bread even close to the recipes at chompies. That includes their cakes and cookies. The Scottsdale location has the best bakery hands down in Arizona. Old school European type baking spot on to the 50's and 60's imigrants that came from Europe and started these recipes..fresh brisket sliders with potatoe pancakes on a bun are to die for. The Jewish version of White Castle..Scotsdale only large BOBKA cake is the real things. Pastrami sandwiches excellent though not the best ever. Missing authentic old style deli mustard unfortunately. If you want authentic Jewish style look no further unless you want to waste your time. There is no authentic better bagels hands down anywhere in ARIZONA AND I MEAN ANYWHERE.. This place is the real deal and will bring back New York memories of the best food you have ever eaten to this day. Costs a bit more but you get what you pay for in taste and wuality",

We decided to make a specific trip out there for dinner this past weekend and to be honest I was a little underwhelmed. The food was just OK compared to being excellent like it always was before. I'm not sure if there was a change in how they do things but we weren't served a plate of pickles like we used to upon being seated. I looked around the restaurant and didn't see any other tables with them either so maybe they stopped doing it, which is a bummer. Probably the most disappointing thing about the visit was the fact that I had ordered a Black & White cookie to go from the bakery counter and instead of putting the cookie in a plastic container they guy out it in a bag. Normally a cookie in a bag wouldn't be a big deal but by the time I went to eat the cookie later that evening about half of the chocolate on top was stuck to the inside of the bag and I was left with having to scrape it off which kind of ruined what was otherwise a delicious cookie. Oh well...guess we just won't make any special trips out that was just for Chompie's.",

I decided to grab a few quick things from the bakery, wasn't even going to sit to eat. I wasn't even greeted by the 2 people standing at the door. I don't usually care about that but it was just another thing atop everything else. After I get inside, I see multiple people waiting around for someone to come to the bakery to be helped, someone finally does and the employee walks away. Its my turn now and are ready to order.   I stood around for a good five minutes until I started looking for someone to help. As soon as I found the hostess, she started walking away. Listen, I understand that there are plenty of responsibilites of each employee but I didn't even get a look from her. After walking back towards the register, I see an employee writing something down, I think it may have been the manager or something because they didn't look like a waitress. I kind of look at them and they look right back at me and look back down to continue writing something down. No \"can I help you?\" or \"can I get someone for you?\". I eventually just lost all hope at that point and left.  Like I said, I love Chompie's. Their jewish sliders and assorted bakery items are off the charts, but this location just fell flat. Me and my friends won't ever step foot in there again. If you have the choice, go to the one on University. Much better service.",

I called the number on their front door but they said the power was out even though I can clearly see all the lights on and all the stuff just standing around inside. Called them and they had enough power to pick up the call and tell me they were closing for the night. I asked if I could just buy cakes but they said no to that because their registers weren't up. The thing is I can see the registers have their screen powered on through the glass window and I'm also posting this using their WiFi so I don't understand how the power can be out. I just want to get some cakes.",

We were seated right away and were a little overwhelmed by the HUGE menu that was handed to us. We started off with coffee and were able to pick from about a million different creamers. I got the Chompie's Breakfast Sliders which were scrumptious:) Challah, potato pancake, sausage patty, fried egg and american cheese. Oh, and a side of fruit (so I didn't feel as guilty). My boyfriend got the Stuffed Pancake...lets just say I don't think he read where it said, \"Extra Large\". A pancake with scrambled eggs, and crispy bacon rolled burrito style. Both him and I could have shared it, it was that big.  Anyways, it was yummy and we were stuffed the rest of the day.",

While I had no urge to try and stuff myself silly, the sliders sounded tasty!  Chompie's is a casual eatery with a laid-back vibe.  It's not a date spot but definitely a great place for a quick bite and good times.  Some of my favorites are the Jewish Sliders, Greek Benedict, Mark's Monte Cristo, and the Western Sliders.  Don't forget to pick up some rye bread or bagels on the way out.  Yum!  I hear they do a Valentine's Day special now.  Oh to be young and kosher...",

    "text": "My niece requested Chompie's while in town visiting from the east coast. It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available.   But, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!  She did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.  We usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons: 1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.   2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.  As always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.  And, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away.",

To the manager: if your staff represents a deal as being a certain way, and the patrons have already eaten the food, you have to honor the representation (especially when possible discrepancies had been brought up AND clarified before ordering). You cannot show up after the food has been eaten and say you can't honor the deal. Yes you can honor it, and you just embarrassed a patron, your waiter, and yourself by that useless confrontation. What am I supposed to do, un-eat the food?",

I like the egg and cheddar on a toasted bagel without meat. On 5 separate occasions spread out over a couple months in a row, I ordered the egg and cheddar on a bagel. Every time, they added bacon to it. A few times, they just tried to pull the bacon off the cheese (with little bits of bacon embedded in it still). The first time I had to call the manager and have it refunded on my card. He promised it wouldn't happen again.  The next time, I checked in the car before I walked out. Bacon.  The next three times, I checked in the store AND asked the cashier to please go tell the chefs not to put bacon on it. All three times, they put bacon on the sandwich. Are you kidding me??  I really don't think they're intentionally deciding to put bacon on a sandwich that they know is intended for a vegetarian. I think they just don't pay attention and don't care. And apparently the manager and cashier don't care either. I'm definitely one to give many chances to fix a mistake, but clearly this is just the attitude of this place. It's a bummer - I like the bagels better than Einsteins and other local shops, but how can I endorse a place that's either disrespectful to me or vegetarians?",

It took about 10 minutes to get a drink order which one of the hostesses had to take because our waiter was too busy to take it.  When he finally came over to our table, the hostess was taking our order for our waiter, he started taking my husband's order.  They had to combine their notes to get the order straight.  It took about 30 minutes to get our sandwiches.  I had a 1/2 tongue sandwich.  The meat was  not just soft, it was gushy.  I also order a potato kanish, it was grumbling as I was eating it. It should have been soft. My husband loved his corned beef 1/2 sandwich. I guess that was the highlight of the evening.  We paid for our food and went to the bakery and had to wait 5 minutes for the guy at the counter to get our order for bagels and black and whites.  He actually was very nice and gave us a bag and put my leftovers from dinner and my black and whites into a bag for me. Actually this was the highlight of my evening.    Chompies as a whole is going down in quality lately no matter what location you go to.  This is still the best location that I ever went to and I've been to Tempe, Scottsdale and this one. With the hit and misses that I have experience, I wouldn't go to any other one.",

I ordered a Coney Island Knish and requested that the Knish be microwaved NOT deep fried. Just like I am used to, yummy. Our server was incredible and very attentive.  Our experience at the bakery was the worst we have ever had. There were no other customers waiting and the clerk couldn't get us out of there fast enough. In the process she missed part of our order. Disappointed that we were treated so poorly.",

Worst part is though, the food used to be so good. All four of us were disappointed with our food and we all ordered different things. Such a waste. It not like I wouldn't eat there is a friend wanted to go, the food isn't gross, it's just not good enough to be worth going out to eat and paying for it.   Maybe I'll check out the one in Tempe to see if it's better.",

The lemon cookie has good flavor but is rock hard and I suspect several days old.  Oh and it took over 10 mins for them to make this....I was the only person at the takeout counter. Haha  I'm not even mad, it's SO bad that all I can do is laugh!",

The loaves of bread looked really awesome! I'm definitely going to add it as a stop in my grocery shopping circle. It's conveniently located on the way to the Chandler Costco.  The Baja Burger 14.99 is ridiculous! It could easily feed 2 people or just a hungry teenage boy.  I ordered a half turkey sandwich and had to take a lot of the turkey off so I could actually eat it. Next time I'll order a half and extra bread to make another half.   The menu is huge so there's something for everyone. Great choice for breakfast or lunch! $5.00 mimosas!  The check in black and white cookie was so sweet it literally hurt my teeth!",

My husband and son had the corn beef hash and I opted for the protein pancakes.  No bad decisions were made today.   The corn beef hash was tasty and even had the crunchy edges that we love. You MUST try the bagels (made in house) with the chive cream cheese.  ** You're welcome. **  The protein pancakes are awesome. They have granola, slivered almonds and blueberries mixed in the batter. Again, they have crispy edges.  One order will feed two people.  On your way out, stop by the bakery.  I would recommend the cinnamon rugulah (I KNOW I spelled that one wrong!) and coffee cake.

We walked in and were immediately seated on a busy Saturday brunch time, gave drink orders and were given this complimentary delicious sweet bread that paired so well with my hot tea. I also got a cabbage roll because why not, which was very good, and my husband got biscuits and gravy. Next time we are there I want to try dishes I haven't heard of, like their knish? And of course I should try their hot pastrami. It was a good find and we will definitely be back!

    "text": "First let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of CHompies and have been for over 20 years. We go to the one at Paradise Valley mall at least one month, many times more. I thought long and hard about writing this review since have been such a fan, but my last trip to this location was horrible. There were five of us at the table and four people had issues with their food.   To start off with it took 15 minutes for the so called waitress to take our order. She appeared dirty, distracted, and maybe just not feeling well but she should have probably stayed home... She seemed bothered to take an order.  2nd issue - we never got our pickles...   Drink orders came after our food..    My 10 y/o son ordered a child breakfast - they put mayo on the pancakes!! MAYO NOT BUTTER!!!! When we mentioned to the waitress and the waiter who was helping deliver food, we were told gross, they both laughed and made no attempt to replace his food. Needless to say he did not eat his pancakes!  My son in law ordered a cheese burger - it was burnt so bad, he could only eat half, no matter how much ketchup he put on it. Never got his order of ranch (we asked on 4 separate occasions).  My 8.5 month pregnant daughter chicken sandwich was under cooked.. Once again not able to finish her meal. When mentioned to the waitress who finally brought our silverware (everyone is almost done eating) she rolled her eyes and walked away, after mentioning that the manager was  in the kitchen.   My sandwich - what was ordered was a ham and cheese on rye w/ mayo and a side of mustard, with potato salad. what was delivered was ham and cheese plain - no mayo or mustard. Asked for again and never received when mentioned to her my food was incorrect.   We had to ask for the bill on 3 separate occasions, when it finally came i noticed that one meal was taken off of the bill. I thought this was because of all of the issues. Imagine my shock while at the bakery my husband noticed it was  special that weekend buy a burger, get a chicken sandwich free.   We will stick with the Paradise Valley Mall location, this was one of the worst experiences have ever had.. We will not be returning to this location.",

The only reason I am giving them three stars is because they had some of the best bagels I have ever tried and their cream cheese with chives was amazing.

They did not want to pay for their cream cheese, okay I get it there are difficult people. When this difficult lady left, I just wanted to move on and not dwell upon it. Then the cashier continues to complain to me as I was placing my order. It felt very awkward to be complain to and I tried my best to change the topic but it just kept coming up.  Furthermore, I got a earful when the cashier started yelling at one of the servers right in front of my very eyes. Then the server went into the kitchen and started yelling at someone else.  This is a great place and I have been coming here for years, but I think I will reconsider knowing how much drama there is here. I hope they can improve how they behave in front of their customers.",

Normally I am able to finish this entire plate at the Paradise Valley and Tempe locations.    The cabbage roll was a bit sweet and the potato pancake was dry.  I tried my friend's home fries and it didn't have much flavoring.  The glazed carrots were tasty though.  It was my first visit so maybe I should have tried the matzo ball soup instead.",

    "text": "For Breakfast:  Well I decided to try Chompies for breakfast today and I got portobellas again so I must be a gluten for punishment.  I was actually seated in the front today which was cool and my waitress was very nice, but the eggs benedict was not what I was expecting.  The Portobello Benedict is more expensive than all but the one with lox which was kinda sad since I am vegetarian.  They have departed from the standard eggs benedict with not a appealing result.  It comes on a bagel that is supposed to be toasted which is wasn't. So it was cold and chewy and a whole lot of bread in comparison to the rest of the toppings. They also decided to add cheese to all of the different combos which when you combine it with the hollandaise is not a good thing.  And there were only two tiny pieces of mushroom on the whole plate.... so I am not sure what I was charged extra for. Very disappointing there are far better eggs benny in the area ( see my other reviews )  Maybe this place is just not for vegetarians.  If you do go and order the eggs benedict do yourself a favor and get the english muffin ( tell them to toast it ) and skip the cheese.  For Lunch:  When I ate here with some friends in the middle of the afternoon we were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant.  We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.  They were pretty dead so you would think they would want to keep the travel distance to a minimum.  Another group was seated about 10 minutes later across the room from us and they actually had the server move them.  The food was just average at best.  Nothing really stood out on the menu when we were ordering. I got a pretty tasteless Portabella/Goat Cheese salad.  The service we pretty slow, but it might have just been due to the 30 minute hike to our table.  Maybe I'll have to come back by for breakfast.",

Service was very friendly and coffee refills came quickly and without asking which is always appreciated.

Firstly the menu is just humongous it took me a good 10 minutes just to scan it. On finding the chopped liver sandwich I ordered that but made the error of asking the waitress for the accompanying bread (which she suggested as rye). SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.  The chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it. However the combination of the sweet rye and gamey chopped liver made the sandwich rather disgusting.  Next time if I go back I'm, getting the corned beef with challlah or onion pocket.",

Somehow the second slider was abnormally gigantic and I was not able to get to the third. I know, excuses, excuses...but its the truth people!

The bad: When we arrived, it was probably a normal lunch crowd, full but with a handful of open tables. Hostess was really bad - barely acknowledged us and only mumbled. The hostess kept walking away and returning and pretty much refused to make eye contact. Seemed very strange and rude. And we weren't the only ones waiting that were irritated. Took quite a while to be seated. Once we were sat, the table and chairs were filthy. Hostess return to wipe it, but shouldn't have bothered. Eventually got someone else to clean the table off.   The good: Ordered sliders, a side salad, and the roasted tomato/mushroom/goat cheese salad and they were all delicious and large portions. They also brought us blueberry muffin/cake before our food came and it was delicious too. Manager ended up bringing us some cookies and they were quite yummy too.   Our waitress was very good and attentive, so hopefully the hostess and the cleanliness issue was a fluke. Will update my review if we return and this changes.",

Chompies was open and we called.  We confirmed that if we arrived before 6:30pm we would be seated.  Upon arrival at 6:10pm we were told that we would not be seated because the management had changed their minds about seating times.  We explained that we had called and were told 6:30pm to which we were told we were out of luck.  Now, typically this would have been an inconvenience but tonight we had our 89 year old grandmother with us for dinner.   I immediately asked to speak to the manager and was visibly irritated.  A manager came out and I requested to speak to Mitch, the general manager.  Mitch came out and immediately apologized for the inconvenience, the misunderstanding and assured us that all would be handled.  The hostess staff informed us it would be approximately an hour before we would be seated, so we waited.  About 15 minutes later we were in a booth and ready to go.    Drinks were served in a most timely fashion and dinner was fantastic!!!  It took a bit to get there bit  it was Christmas and the place was jam packed!!!  Absolutely will be back!  Mitch brought our food out and was an absolute gentleman!  We thanked him, apologized for our irritation and wished him a great holiday!    Mitch - I'll be calling tomorrow to say thanks again, but you sir are amazing and a gentleman!  Thank you for saving Christensen Christmas dinner 2016.  Damn dogs.",

The deli counter is bizarre you swap why does it take 20 minutes to toast a bagel or some throw some cream cheese on it. That's a did you actually order something that needs to be cooked you talk to 25 minutes plus.

We decided to eat at Chompie's for a graduation luncheon to celebrate with family and friends... What started out being fine with our drinks served transformed into a nightmare.   Food was served...by the owner (did not know that at the time) I ordered their signature meal- the jewish sliders, others ordered the coney hotdog, potato pancakes, salmon bagel. Food looked fine but looks can be very deceiving.   Everyone had at least a bite taken when I looked up and saw the mortified face of the person seated across from me. That look only means one thing...something terrible is wrong and it's on you! I looked down to find the largest cockroach I have ever seen crawling on my left shoulder!    As a side note, I am not afraid of bugs... However a cockroach is far more then just a simple bug, and the size of this cockroach would give the heebie-jeebies to the toughest men.  Naturally, I swatted at it... Making it land close to the person I was sitting next towe both in reaction jumped out of the booth we were in ... The man that delivered our food just moments ago was there in an instant & to our shock grabbed this beast of a rodent by his bare hands.  My only thought is that the next table he served got a little extra on their plate!   Not even having one full bite of my lunch the only thing the manager did was say he would take care of the meal... WHAT MEAL? We didn't get to get before our unwanted guest arrived, in my view absolutely nothing was done to rectify this absolutely grotesque situation.  This was no ordinary lunch, this was a lunch to celebrate a great achievement and enjoy each other company.  Now forever will these graduates will remember their graduation lunch with a huge disgusting cockroach oppose a celebration of their success as to what the lunch was intended for.   Not only did Chompie's completely embarrass me, it also completely mortified me.   I want you to image a cockroach the size of your thumb crawling on you right after you bight into your food... How would you react and feel?   Then add a special celebration to the situation.  I am completely mortified.",

But then something happens making me question why we come here...  Someone needs to use the restroom. If you ever have the need preparers be disgusted. These are some of the nasties restrooms in the in industry. The floors are covered in grease, they smell, they look like they are never professionally cleaned. Check out the partially alive cock roach laying on the floor. Then you have to touch the soap dispenser and the handles and the towel dispenser.   Sure few people wash their hands thoroughly for 2-3 minutes with soap in hot water but most people don't use enough soap and clearly don't rinse for 2 minutes and the rest of the people, kids included, leave the piss and crap on their hands...and all that leave this room with the cooks, wait staff, hostesses, dishwashers, etc. fecal matter EVERYWHERE because everyone has to touch all that stuff.   Back to the ROACH...well if there is 1 there is at least 1000. If their germs aren't enough then think of all that poison that is needs to partially kill this one. It has to be all over this establishment. Picture to prove it...check it out.   Someone needs to call the health inspector and they should bring the roach patrol. This place is nasty.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been to 3 different Chompies locations in the valley.  During Customer Appreciation Week this year I went to the Chompies in Chandler 3 times for Jewish Sliders that were 2 for $5.  These were the worst sliders I have ever eaten.  They were not fresh, no cheese on them, super small compared to regular sliders, the gravy was way too salty and really dark compared to other times.  I have ordered the sliders over 5 times during non-customer appreciation week and they are always bigger, not as salty and fresher.  The first time I called back and spoke with Mitch and he said if I have another problem I should ask for a manager.  Next time I went I asked to speak with someone when I got my smaller than normal sliders for the second time in a row and I waited about 5 mins and no one came back to me.  Then I ordered them again on Friday July 27th and they were better but still super small.  Very skimpy, barely any meat, but did taste better and wasn't so salty.  Bottom line don't get sliders during Customer Appreciation Week it is a scam/sham, I don't like writing reviews and complain but this needed to be said.  If I had never gone to Chompies before I probably wouldn't have realized I was getting skimped on the sliders, seems like a small issue but this is not right and Chompies is already way over priced and expensive for the food they serve, we like it cause it is open on holidays and convenient.  I will be boycotting Chompies for a while.  They really don't appreciate their customers, this is a great example of them trying to make more money.",

I'm not the type to order something crazy, at least not for drinks, but I find watered down drinks disgusting. The server at chompies did the one thing that gets me in a bad mood, add ice to my soda when I specifically ask for no ice.   Now, it is the first time I have even gone to chompies and the menu was very lengthy. Not something that I mind but every sandwich seemed to have coleslaw on it. I was actually quite surprised about the entire homey atmosphere here as I always envisioned chompies to be like einsteins.   Once the food came out I discovered that when the menu said horseradish they meant the sauce kind. There seemed to be a long wait for our food and it was cold when it was served. They also gave fruit instead of the requested Coleslaw with my boyfriends sandwich.   Taste wise it was decent but nothing spectacular. I don't think I will be coming here again any tim",

They have a deli/bakery you can peruse while you wait.  The servers are a bit stand off-ish, but that kind of adds to the NY feel of the deli. They have breakfast all day, as well as lunch/dinner options. I've had both, but today went with savory.  I started with their matzo ball soup...amazing. It's homemade, with light and fluffy matzo balls, a wonderfully seasoned broth, and carrots and onions.   For my entree, I had the Nike high pastrami on rye. It was probably the largest sandwich I've ever seen in my life/ the homemade rye bread was excellent, and the pastrami was so well done and lean!! I could barely finish the sandwich given it's size!  One of the best brunch/breakfast options in Phoenix. If you're really hungry try the slider challenge that was featured on Man v Food.",

I've never had anything that wasn't fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. They've got bagels, about 10-12 flavors of cream cheese, danishes, turnovers, cookies (all made in house), sandwiches, wraps, Lox, smoked fish, loaves of bread, etc. Pretty much everything you would expect from a NY deli. And I've always received excellent service. 4.5 stars  I highly recommend Chompie's. They offer a bagel deal  on Wednesdays and a deal on deli meat after 4pm every week day.

    "text": "My friends have raved about this place for 15 years. In fact, as a Jewish man, raised in the northeast, I would say it's downright pathetic that I haven't been here yet. However today was the first time I made my way.  On one hand, I want to praise the heck out of this place. It's one part Jewish delicatessen, one part bakery, with a dash of a restaurant for good measure. They have all my favorites on the menu, knishes, matzo ball soup, blintzes, black and whites, babka; you name it, they've got it.   The food is amazing! I got babka french toast with bacon, and it was absolutely delicious. I had so much of it, that I had to bring half home and eat it the next morning!  Unfortunately, they fell short in the bakery/deli department.  First, I tried to buy a Coney Island knish. They were out, and told me that they wouldn't be making any more until about 6 hours later. I was not happy, but I was still excited by the pastries, and soon got help from someone.   Unfortunately, when I was in the middle of asking him questions, he abandoned me. I had to go to the back of a growing line to get help. To his credit, he eventually apologized, and I understood because he was helping his new staff member.   But he still made me go to the back of the line afterwards. I had already waited about 10 minutes to get service, and now I had to go to the back and wait another 10 minutes? He didn't make any motion to say that he would be helping me, even though I came before all those other people in line.   I guess he thought I had a lot of time on my hands, or that I was unworthy of help. It was incredibly insulting service, and I have never in all my years of dining, experienced something like that.  Will I go back? Probably. But only if it's convenient.",

There were two other groups ahead of us when we got here and the hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait.  30 minutes later (have validation) we were seated.  I just wish they were better at guessing the time.  The line started piling up behind us too and the hostess continued to tell the people 10 minutes.  I should be able to rate each area of our visit separately.  The hostess gets a 1/5.   The kitchen gets a 3/5.  It was decent food.  Just no concern for detail.  We typically remember to say no fruit in our water.  Think about it.  If they don't wash it first, everything that that skin has touched and touched it, is now bathing in your water to be consumed.  And grow.  Anyways, I'll answer the question for you.  NO.  They do not wash the lemons.  See the picture with sticker still on it floating in my husband's glass.  Chocolate chips on waffle.  1-2 tablespoons right in the middle.  Just little stuff.  Tasted fine.    Zach was our waiter last time and this time.  He gets a 5/5.  He is never the problem and I hate he gets crumpled in it.  He is realistic.  Will tell you how long to expect.  Knowledgeable of the menu.  Makes great recommendations and is attentive.",

The friendly hostess greeted us when the three of us walked in and said it would be about 5 minutes. Cool, no problem. We were seated within 5 minutes and waited for our server. Once he came out, we order drinks and waited a long time for them to arrive. We ordered our food when he brought our drinks. It took such a long time that he swung by our table to let us know that our food would be out shortly (probably figuring we were getting hangry lol).     Alas, our food had finally arrived...WRONG. My boyfriend and his friend had both ordered the Western burgers and they were practically missing everything. On top of that, the meat patties were extremely overcooked - basically burned to a crisp. But even their sides looked less than appealing. I honestly could not even look at their burgers because I would have immediately lost my appetite. I had ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon. Eggs were fine, bacon turned out extra crispy, and the pancakes had black flakes all over them I assume from the griddle.  When you usually tell a server what is wrong, they take the food back and return with a new correct order. Instead, when the boys informed our server that the order was wrong, he left and eventually came back with a small plate of missing ingredients: cheese, bacon, etc. They ate that nasty burned, most likely old, meat because they were starving and could not wait any longer for food.   No surprise, both of them got sick and felt miserable all day and night. Thank you Chompie's for making my boyfriend sleep with a trashcan next to him :(",

    "text": "Yelp tip! Check in and you will receive one of their delicious black and white cookies, (chocolate and vanilla frosting) which are too big to eat by yourself and good for sharing (if you like)!  **If you are staying at the Westin Element down the street, you will receive a 20% discount.  Some of the servers do not know about the discount, so it's a good idea to inquire first.  As you enter the restaurant, their display cases of baked goods, bread and deli items always make me stop and look at everything.  Save your appetites for after the meal and take some items to go whether you want something sweet for dessert or deli items to grab for another meal later.   Our server for breakfast was Mimi and she was fantastic! Super friendly and our food was served quickly.  Mimi was also very attentive.  Split French toast breakfast: Classic French toast (6 pieces), 3 strips of bacon and 2 eggs. This meal is great if you can't decide on sweet and/or salty for breakfast, which is me half of the time. Perfect size for splitting with endless coffee.    If you opt out of breakfast, you can order a classic new york deli-style pastrami or corned beef sandwich.  The breakfast menu also has a good selection of breakfast items and the hardest part is narrowing down your options in time to order.  The restaurant is roomy and they bus tables quickly, so there is never evidence lingering of large crowds - - which sometimes breakfast restaurants tend to do.  Plenty of parking in shopping center where the restaurant is located, too, especially for big cars.  We drove the truck today and you can always tell if there is large truck/SUV parking when you drive up and there's already big cars comfortably parked in the lot.",

It was a busy afternoon but our waitress was just \"on it\", attentive and running around with a smile on her face. Great service and great food. Portions are HUGE! Everything we had was PERFECT. We had a place similar to this back east and we really missed it, Chompie's is our reminder to home for us now in AZ. Will definitely be back. They have the best bagels, like what we'd get on the east coast. And OMG, their baked goods! Don't even get me started, we took a lot of stuff home. Definitely a huge fan of Chompie's!!",

I ordered a country fried steak and I honestly don't like that. I let the waitress know and I told her I was very sorry because it was my fault, and what I thought I was having was a regular ground beef patty. She was kind enough to update my order and brought out a beef patty. I was very surprised at how nice and understanding she was.   However the food itself was not appetizing. The hamburger patty was not seasoned at all and the texture was like rubber. I was able to eat all my fries, because those were very good and were possible homemade fries, but I left hungry.   I am glad the waitress was kind and helpful, but unfortunately the food was not a reason I would come back.",

I drank iced tea, which was good, and I got the corned beef hash skillet with a pumpernickel bagel. Some of the dishes seem pricey, but you do get a sizable portion. Even half-sandwiches are very large, and they do NOT skimp on the meat. My food tasted great, and everyone who was with me seemed to enjoy theirs as well.  The menu is vast, so it was pretty hard to choose what to eat, and everything looked good because I was hungry. I noticed they took their bagel melts off the menu and was disappointed in that. On my last visit, I got a bagel piled high with corned beef, melty cheese, and sauerkraut, and it was delish! The pastries they were sampling were tasty, and all the cookies looked great, but I didn't get any.",

It was great that they had misters, but they need to turn them down because I was getting soaked! At all the other locations I've been to, the first thing the server does it usually place a basket of bread in the center of your table and take your drink orders. No bread. I asked the server if bread was no longer complimentary and she said it wasn't, but offered to bring us out some pickles (Which she should have done in the first place, in that case). Pickles were not something that I was dying to eat as an appetizer. Next, we looked at the menu. What a jumbled mess! The selection is awesome, but they had stuffed WAY too many items on a single page. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and when it finally came out, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It tasted way different than it did at the other location. The meat was super bland, and kind of grayish. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location.",

First off, the Pastrami got the consistency of \"rubber beef\" like cheap Roast Beef from Subway, huge turn off. Roast beef kinda the same, like its a solution soaked piece of meat before cooking, hell, even Jersey Mikes does a better Roast Beef, its got FLAVOR. Epic fail on my two favs. No real Jewish deli would be caught dead serving that rubber meat garbage. . That was strike one. My sister in law was in town and took her here, she had the fish and had food poisoning for the next 3 days. That was strike 2.

    "text": "disclaimer: this review and the two stars are for the chandler location ONLY! i will post a review of the tempe location along with the extra star it deserves. i grew up around authentic kosher delis and was in love with chompie''s the first time i went to the tempe location. we went past the one in chandler and decided to give it a try. the restaurant was not busy yet it took quite a while for our sever, who seemed to hate her job, to even come get our drink orders. our drinks came and then it was another 15 minutes until we got our 1/2 sandwich and soup. our waitress then disappeared. the corned beef was lukewam and a little fattier than i'm used to. the matzo ball soup was good-no bagel chips, however. the service shocked me- i'm tempted to give this a one star review since our waitress, amy, was so rude and horrible. i will still be a chompie's fan but plan to avoid the chandler location at all costs!",

    "text": "My first visit to Chompies and it was delish!!  So much to choose from on the menu it took me forever to decide.  My waiter was patient with me and offered up some suggestions.  I was bad, so bad.  I had a Monte Cristo Sandwich with fries.    While I waited for my food I took it all in.  I love the NY vibe, the walls with pictures of NY and all the great things about NY.  It made me want to get on a plane and take another trip to NY!!!  And there are several TV's to watch events.  This evening I watched the Mets play and sadly, they lost.    My sandwich was delish!!  Nicely dusted with powered sugar and the ham and turkey were excellent.  The fries were perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffly on the inside.  And my waiter checked on me several times which I appreciated.    I cannot wait to return and try more things off the menu.  I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous.  I took half home.  I am giving three stars for now but I'm sure I will bump it up after I've tried the  potato pancakes and the matzo ball soup.   *drool*",

All of this is in size 10 font, it's like a novel!! There's so much to choose from! As I scan over the menu, I see everything from breakfast,  sandwiches, burgers, traditional dinners, and on and on....  We eventually chose the oh so delicious Greek Chomp-a-dilla (Sauteed spinach, minced garlic, greek feta cheese, diced tomato, onions, scallions & a hint of Parmesan cheese) for an appetizer. Very fresh and the combo of flavors go well together.   I had the Chicken in the Pot, holy mother... when they brought it out, it was so big that I actually sputtered, \"How am I supposed to... eat it?\" Another table had noticed just how giant my entree was and had to ask what in the world I ordered. This bowl of soup had 2 halves chickens, (not diced, not cubed, a chicken cut in half!), celery, carrots, jumbo matzo balls, kreplach, and noodles. They gave me a friggn' ladle for cryn' out loud.   Plus they had so many delicious looking pastries just begging us from the desert case, we just had to get cheesecake to go.  Can't wait back to try the endless menu!",

    "text": "I went to Chompies for a quick bite during work after hearing the buzz  about the great NY style deli sandwiches on tap. I sat at the bar, though small, it obviously wouldn't be a place I would sit and have a few drinks after work. I was reminded by the manager that they now have a happy hour with $1 off drafts! Good to know.   I had the Hot Pastrami sandwich with a cup of Tortilla Soup. The size of pastrami was very generous and I barely finished half. The pastrami was stacked 3 inches high and was so tender and juicy. I liked that it had a nice crust of peppery goodness on the edge of each slice. Slap that on Jewish Rye and you're in business!  The soup was good, not great, but good. I don't think it had enough flavor, it was missing a hint of spice and more generous pieces of chicken. It didn't stand out to me.  My only gripe was the NY prices. Out the door with tip was $21, so not an average lunch. I think that would be the only reason why I wouldn't frequent this place more often. Jason's Deli is right across the street and whereas Chompie's pastrami sandwich is better, sadly I don't think it is that much better to warrant the price.   I'd definitely give it a go. Next time I'll try a reuben!",

While I've enjoyed the food and have had friendly service, I'm just not excited about the place.  The pastry display at the front of the store is beautiful and definitely piques your interest, but I'd say it's 1/3-1/2 full of butter cookies and while butter cookies are good, how excited can you get about them?  The prices are a little high, but then kids eat free on Tuesday.",

Whenever my sister and mom visit from Tucson, we come to Chompie's and they stock up on dozens of bagels to last them until the next time they come up.   Since we ordered before 11am on a weekday, I got my breakfast (2 eggs, bacon and two huge pancakes) for $3.99. I checked the receipt and asked the waitress if that price was right because I couldn't fathom all that for $3.99.  I can't really speak for some of the other reviews as far as wait times, etc, because yesterday when we went for breakfast (about 10:45) we had good service, and right as we were leaving (probably 11:30 or so) it had gotten SO busy, it was so crowded we could barely get out the door. But that just tells me that everyone loves this place, I don't know why the overall rating for Chompie's is only a 3!",

I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.  i was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's.",

I saw something on Food Network \"Man Vs.Food\" where the host had to eat 12 Jewish Sliders..I just had to try them out. One night a few months back me and my partner wanted to eat at Famous Dave's nearby. They were packed so I said I wanted to check out Chompie's. We were not disappointed. Every time I go I just get the Jewish Slider combos (3 sliders and fries)..It is delish!  My partner usually orders a sandwich or fish and chips.  The service was adequate, nothing to complain about.   The only problem anyone had was when someone ordered ribs, they were not that good.  Save that for the bbq place. What I love is that Chompie's also has the bakery/deli counter in the front.",

Have heard so many good things about this place from friends, even Adam Richmond (Man vs Food) said it was good. Where to start....I love a good rueben so I ordered the Granpa Rudy with corned beef instead of pastrami, $14.99. The most tastless sandwhich I have ever eaten. The corned beef had NO flavor at all, the cheese was tastless and I am not sure if it even had dressing. It doesn't matter how much corned beef you pile on a sandwich, if it's tastless all you have is a big pile of tastless meat! My gf ordered the sliders. Again the brisket (I think thats what it was suppose to be) was bland as anything, the gravy was so heavy it ruined everything and the potato cakes were burnt, greasy and tasted like they were old. I even took some photos but refuse to post them and give Chompies free advertising. This was a \"been-there-done-that\" moment. Won't be back.",

I was really excited as other locations I've visited were fantastic.  Unfortunately, both of my visits have left me unimpressed.  The first visit, we requested a booth. While we were happy to wait for one, they seated us at a table despite several gentle reminders of our request.    We ordered breakfast, an all American and a two egg breakfast.  The service was slow and apathetic. The food was served lukewarm.  Well, we all have our off days so I figured we'd try again and see if things would be better this time around.   Unfortunately, it was a bit worse with the exception of our server. The food was served late, cold and with hard bagels.    Despite this, I love their bagels so after we choked down our breakfast, we headed to the deli counter to pick up some to take home.  While waiting patiently, we were ignored  and passed over 3 separate times. It took a total of roughly 22 minutes to get 6 bagels.  When we were finally served, it was with all the hospitality of Lurch. Sorry to put you out there, buddy.   Anyway, it will be an unlikely event that I will return.   Fool me once...",

There were lots of employees standing around, picking each other up, chatting, etc. but not doing anything else. Our waiter forgot what my daughter ordered for her drink and ignored my son, who had just arrived and had not ordered yet. The food took forever to come, it was freezing in the restaurant and my husband needed more coffee but none was offered. We asked for a refill on my daughter's drink and for more coffee. There were only 2 place settings for our party of 4 and we had to ask for more.  The mashed potatoes were awful. Neither one of my kids ate them. Two of us had omelets which were good. My son had a latke burger which was really good and my daughter had chicken and Matzo balls (dumplings) which she wasn't impressed with. One of the reasons we went to Chompies was for the Mother's Day gift of a slice of white cake with raspberry filling. Found out at the end of the meal that it only came with the Mother's Day dinner which was $19.95. Our waiter actually giggled when he said I couldn't have it. As we were paying he came out with a piece of the cake. Said they had lots of it so it redeemed him a little bit. Overall, a very disappointing outing.",

Again, the servers were slow and rude and the food mediocre at best. Won't make the same mistake again.",

Poached eggs are always hit or miss at casual places, but I'd ordered this before with success at the north Scottsdale location. The plate came out sloppy, but that's not really worth mentioning. The problem was that one of my poached eggs was raw. Of course a poached egg has a runny yolk but runny whites? Nope. Not eating that. I sent it back and the manager came out to argue with me that sometimes poached eggs have runny whites and that's just how they cook them. Well, why was one of them ok and the other was a blister sitting on a piece of ham? She eventually only charged me for the egg I did eat, which is fine, but why argue with me for not wanting to eat a raw egg?  TLDR: Not going back to the Chandler Chompie's. Tempe and Scottsdale are still ok.",

There was a 20 minute wait which we were ok with. When we get seated, the waitress was doing her part. She grabbed us some waters, but she put lemon inside my water, which I still don't get because I did not ask for lemon. We just asked if we could get bottled water. That was not a problem, but waiting 35 minutes for our food when I ordered bacon and eggs and my BF ordered eggs Benedict was a little irritating. . The people who sat down next to us got their food before we did and they came in after we had already ordered. I heard them order and they had two omelettes. Why was our food taking so long? When we finally did get our order, my plate had black all around it and I could wipe it off with my napkin. My BF's  food looked like a bagel with a runny mess poured all over it. I got up and walked out. I will never go back to a chompies location.",

Luckily, it wasn't a big fat fail.  It was a big fat success.  Tried the Jewish sliders with brisket, gravy, and a potato pancake.  It was like a home-cooked Sunday dinner mom used to make all wrapped up in a challah roll.  Except mom rarely made \"Sunday dinner\" , and if she did, it would have been wrapped in a tortilla or a Sonic brown paper bag, since we never heard of challah.  But aside from those minor differences, it was just like Sunday dinner.  Great service for our rather large group, too.  They even brought out some little cookies for us to try, which led us to the bakery on our way out!  Thanks to Jim and Audrey for organizing, and thanks to Chompie's for a great meal!",

    "text": "Went to Chompies at the Chandler Mall today.  It is the second time I have been to this location.  We were seated right away and went ahead and ordered right after we received our drinks.  We waited for a very long time for our lunch to come.  I ordered a chef salad with the fat free honey mustard dressing.  When I looked in my dressing, there was this lump of something in it.  I poured it onto my bowl and it looked like a long rubbery lugie (sp?) or snotty thing.  I was immediately grossed out and was trying to find our waitress to help me out.  We hadn't seen our waitress in a very long time - we even had to call her over a couple of times for refills.  Well, she never came so then we saw the hostess coming by, so we grabbed her and showed her what was on my plate.  She made this horrible face and said she would take it away.  The manager came over after that and said he would expedite another one and tried to explain that the dressings come in a large gallon bucket and so that was rubbery ball was in the gallon of dressing (I actually own a restaurant that serves salads and have never come across something like that in 18 years).    Well, after 15 minutes I finally got another salad.  When we were all done eating, the waitress brought our check to us.  On the bottom of the check it said that there was a comp for a salad for $9.99.  I thought this was a great way to remedy the problem (again, owning a restaurant myself, I would have done the same thing).  HOWEVER, when looking over the entire bill - Chompies staff/manager went ahead and charged me for TWO salads, comping only ONE them!  This way, it looked like they were comping the salad, but they really got paid for it!  We only ordered ONE salad!!  We asked the manager who was standing by our booth, if he meant to charge us for two salads, taking only one of our bill.  He was a bit stunned!  What a sneaky way to do business.  We payed the bill in full and WILL NEVER RETURN!!!!!!",

I have read a lot of the other reviews on this site and I wonder if they ate at the same restaurant I did?  In my opinion an \"authentic\" deli does not sell Boars head meats in their deli.  They make their own meats, smoke their own etc.  They don't buy it from a wholeseller out of the back of the truck behind the store.  Strike one.  Ordered the Pastrami and was beaming from ear to ear when it arrived as I have been looking for a huge stacked Pastrami since I moved to Arizona in 1980.  Unfortunately the Pastrami had absolutely no taste.  So disappointed.  Strike 2.  I then asked for some spicy mustard (hoping it would help with the taste) and was told they don't have that kind of mustard.  Strike 3 we're outta here.  I will give them a point for being as close to a real deli as I have found in Phoenix, but I will definately continue to look and I will definately not be back to Chompies.",

I had my introduction to fried matzo balls & potato pancakes, um..... both were awesome! Who knew that applesauce & sour cream would be so good together as a topping, obviously someone did & they were right. If you've never had matzo ball chicken soup, I suggest you try it. Note: it's the best when you are feeling under the weather! Also tried Rugulach - don't even know how to pronounce that correctly, but it's very similar to Baklava, so if you like that you won't be disappointed & it comes in a variety of flavors. I have to say I like this Chompies better than the one in Tempe for a number of reasons.... but mainly because it's so much closer to my house! Lol :)  Give it a whirl, you won't be sorry, and if you're not sure about what to get - ask your server - they are very friendly & informative! Good job tonight with such a big group & thanks for the extras!!  *****OH YEAH... BTW - THE GOOGLE MAP ADDRESS ON HERE IS WRONG - IT PUTS YOU IN SOME FAR AWAY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE DELI IS RIGHT BEHIND THE CHANDLER MALL. IN THE SPORTS AUTHORITY, BED BATH & BEYOND, DSW, ETC. PARKING LOT. JUST FYI*****",

Was Not busy, yet hostess said would be a 15 minute wait, even though several tables were open.  Was told that we came during \"their\" staff break time.  Have never heard such an idiotic thing in my life.  Close your damn doors and shut down if you can't handle customers at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Asked for a booth for my family of 4 and told none available.  There was one right behind us that was clean and available.  Asked for the empty booth behind us and the hostess said that they don't have a server available for that table, due to current employee breaks.  Totally serious...it was not 5 minutes later that this idiot hostess sat a couple of 2 at this same booth that we (family of 4) could not have.  Finally, someone came to get our drink order and right away told us she is not our server but would get our drinnks.  Eventually we meet our server and first thing out of her mouth was \"ready to order?\".  We told of our booth incident.  She said sorry but tables are on a rotation basis.  What the hell this means, don't know or care.  She offers a booth for us, which we take and she walks off with an attitude.  We sit for close to another 10 minutes with no service.  Apparently, this booth is not her table so now we are back to waiting AGAIN.  We walk out obviously irritated over our terrible experience with Chompies and not one employee says anything to us.  We will never be back.",

A Jersey girl born and raised, I know from New York bagels. These are the closest you'll find west of NJ/NY. No contest. I have tried and loved the pancakes, eggs, bagels of course, sandwiches, and the chicken soup is better than homemade, sorry Grandma. The pastries, cookies, and cakes and scrumptious. The only thing I ever tried that was less than satisfactory was the brisket sliders. (Meat was way too tough.) Oh, they serve Pepsi products, but the manager insisted they will soon offer Coke in cans, like the other locations do. Great food, ample portions, pleasant staff, and reasonable prices with tons of parking and never a long wait. What's not to like?",

Last time we were there my husband ordered well done home fries with his omelette and one side of them were raw so the server brought him new ones (almost 20 mins later) and they had been thrown in the deep fryer.  Really?  we didn't ask for fries...  I asked for an everything bagel and let's just say everything didn't make it on the bagel.  It looked like an onion bagel they forgot to finish putting onions on.  A few of the servers are great but some need to find a new line of work...  For having been a huge Chompie's fan for the past 15 years I can't say this location is living up to my expectations of the Chompie's I have known and loved.",

I got a veggie breakfast sandwich without the cream cheese, I said to add Muenster cheese and she had them put extra mustard and then I had to ask for my cheese, just a little mix-up.  Well they added so much mustard I had to take off one of the pieces of bread.  And I do like my mustard.  The pickles are delish and got a pound to go!!!  I also got one of my fave cookies that I ate when I got home, the big white one with the sprinkles!  LOL!  Howie likes them too.  All in all just an OK experience, nothing great nothing super bad.  You would think that maybe they would give me some dry bread to replace the mustard soaked bread, but not an option.  That's OK.  Next time I will have to get something else or try Jason's deli just across the parking lot.  I have always likes Jason's!",

I chose to do the All you can eat sliders, after being told about it by the waiter.  What I wasn't aware of is that it voided their kids eat free promotion.  With a large family, that hurt.  Our reasonably priced dinner out sucked up two weeks worth of dinners out in one go.   If you have more than two kids, Jason's Deli is a more cost effective Deli in the area.  Even better, Dilly's Deli on the weekends!",

After seeing their menu here on yelp i was very excited (have you seen the size of those pancakes??!) and so was my husband because he's gluten-free.   So i got the dippin sandwich. I'm torn between $16 for a sandwich???? and $16 for a sandwich plus fries piled high with excellent quality brisket. Tough call. But admittedly the meat WAS dry; it's good it came with au jus because it would've been too dry alone. My grandpa liked the pierogis (he's had better he said, not enough cheese i think) but my grandma RAVED over the tender sauce smothered cabbage rolls.   My husband got the pastrami on a gf roll and he LOVED it!! He also tried the liver & onions for the first time and he said it was very good too.   Our waiter was funny, polite, didnt get anything wrong and knew who ordered what. Refills were on time & correct. I would come back! Too bad they arent everywhere.

However, the last few times we've been there, the quality of the food has declined and the service is really bad. It seems as if the whole staff has completely turned over and I feel that's why the service has declined so significantly. For example, this morning, my husband and I went around 9:30. We checked in with the hostess and sat at the bar so we could watch the World Cup match. We sat for 10 minutes and nobody came to see if we needed water or if we were ready to order. There was a gentleman sitting a couple of chairs over, at the bar area, and he had food and the manager came to check on him. After 10 minutes, we left. As we were walking out, the hostess and 2 servers were standing by the hostess station talking and just watched us walk out. I won't be back. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their bagels and breads are good. It is also one of the few places I can get my poppy seed bagel. I guess I will have to get it to go if I want one.",

Big disappointment.  On to my turkey Reuben and once again, 3 strands of kraut even though I requested extra and there was unmelted swiss cheese. Ok, a bad day for the cook. Although we didn't eat the whole sandwich we didn't take the other half to go. It just wasn't good enough. BUT- what really ruined our meal was the lack of service by our waitress Dolyn. She was pleasant enough to start but after she delivered the food, never did show up again. We had to put my half empty, dirty soup bowl on a neighboring table. We twice asked a different waitress to help which she graciously did. So, we 4 will not return to this restaurant. That was a waste of $42. We cut our tip in half to 10%, rather than our usual 20%. With all the numerous dining spots from which to choose, Chompie's is no longer on our list. We often take my aunt and uncle here but no longer. 1 star for this experience today and 1 more star for the other server who helped us.",

Well, first of all because our table was really wobbly and would move whenever we'd lift up our drinks to take a sip, or move ANYTHING on the table. Second, because it was so freaking COLD in there, due to the ceiling fan above us on full speed and the A/C blowing down. I shivered the entire duration of the meal.   Our friend had to keep reminding the waitress, and the helper who helped serve our food, that he ordered cocktail sauce for his All You Can Eat Fish & Chips. It took FOREVER to get that to him! We all got the Fish & Chips Friday Special...while it was pretty good, my fries were too done for me to the point I could only finish about half of them...and just having recent oral surgery, I couldn't eat anything super hard or crunchy due to sensitivity and the surgery areas in the process of healing. My fish, however, was just right and I could eat it without fail.   Took home a piece of Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The cake itself was dry and the frosting was perfect. I was rather disappointed. Also, the floor inside the restaurant was slick and felt greasy. That itself is a safety hazzard.",

So much to look at from cookies, to cakes to awesome deli salads. It was like being back home. While I was looking, I found it frustratingly that two female employee seemed to be huddled up talking instead of helping the other guest around me. Soon we were called to our table. Our server was Luca. He was very nice energetic and polite. He told us about the specials. Though we do not drink ourselves it was great to know that chompies has a 4.00 mimosas every weekend. Our food came out fast and hot. Drinks never to low. Luca told us about the rewards which we never knew about before. My husband swung by the deli for cookies before we left.

The whole sandwich is eight ounces piled high on your choice of bread or roll.  Oh, and before I forget, they have a few gluten free options too. Something to consider if you're in the GF train like so many are and more of us are learning we probably should be too. But anyway, their deli sandwiches are probably the BEST in the Valley.

DELICIOUS!!!   Thank you Linsey!!!  Thank you Chompies!!! Oh yea, and Thank you again Linsey for helping my mother-in-law get set up with the rewards app on her phone, that was super sweet of you!!! We will be back again and again and again!!!!  Everyone there deserves a raise!  :-)",

    "text": "Chompies used to be our favorite but this location continues to fail.  My salad seemed to be a smaller portion (they have summer portion of what I ordered) but they charged me the full amount.  It was average at best.  I thought the salad used to be served with some garlic toast or bread but nothing but the salad in a small white bowl was provided.   The one star comes from what they served my 9 year old. She ordered french toast with bacon. They served her one slice of bread made into french toast and cut in half.  That's it! Literally a single piece of bread and water for $4.99!  Seems a little ridiculous?!  We asked for the bacon that was included which they brought 5 minutes later. I complained about the portion so we were given another piece of french toast bread.  My 7 year old ate the 3 chicken strips which were good.  Chompies has always been known for their generous portions so this was very disappointing!  The restaurant was empty so I would guess they are working on cost savings by providing less food.  Service was slow for an empty restaurant.    PS - The pickles were all mushy and gross.  Not at all Chompies standard.  I expect this location will shut down soon....that bad!",

    "text": "They can't all be winners...  I came excited when I heard about New York inspired foods with a Jewish flare talked about on yelp. I was ready to enjoy knish, matzo balls and the famous Jewish sliders. Then I got lost in a menu straight from the labyrinth and things went south.  The potato knish was a sad sight. Overly cooked on the corners and it blurred into a mound of oil and disenchantment when cut into. Was I in the right place??  The matzo balls came next I know now they are supposedly made of fried matzo meal with eggs and oil, it made me think it was a fancy version of fry bread. However the texture was too odd for me. Having ranch as a side made these passable but utterly forgettable. Are they supposed to be really really greasy??  My Jewish and Western sliders where nothing to write home about. Although I will write to inform you good people that the bread was the best part. From there on the low quality meat really takes center stage as overly oiled fries with an odd skin( likely frozen) bitters a sweet idea with uninspired compromise. The onion ring batter was bland and the onions were so small I almost missed them.  The food missed the mark. The press this place got was undeserved today but even if it wasn't there were a few other things that would keep me away. But I will only talk about the one.  The Menu!!! What the hell? I need a subway map to navigate the damn thing, well over 80 menu options on board. Breakfast served all day. That's nice except I can't make up my damn mind without pulling out my reading glasses for this epoch of a menu. The items where strewn about with no coherent arrangement beside the common starter/entree array which is still convoluted.   I walked out broke and disgusted with myself , like Vegas but less fun. I would say the greasy and flour loaded meals sound like a good cheat meal, but the only person who gets hurt is you...  Eeck :(",

Anyway, since that evening I've been there six or eight times. It's always terrific.  Though I always order a lean corned beef on rye, I've had a number of things with family and friends. Everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food I ate since emerging from the womb. Though I will caution about the matzo ball soup; it has a sweetness I don't care for. We've had blintzes, latkes, fish, knishes... The list is longer but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Everything has been terrific.  Same with the service. I've been treated very well every time I've been there. For good or ill there is now a Chompie's closer to my house. The jury is still out on which it is, I mean, nobody ever said a \"latke a day keeps the doctor away.\" You know what I'm sayin'...",

I had the Philly cheese steak, it was so tasty and the au jus sauce finished the flavored perfect. With a side of fresh fruit you can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because waitress brought us some free samples of the pastries and they were not good, very hard. We had planned on grabbing some pastries to go but didn't because of this. However as walking out we looked at pastry counter and everything looked incredible.

That was a bummer. I love me a balsamic  vinaigrette dressing. The salad really didn't have that much chicken. I really like a salad with plenty of chicken. My mom also got a salad, BBQ chopped chicken salad. The ranch that comes with the salad is not good. I love ranch but this ranch is not good at all! My moms plate for her salad was dirty and crusty on the outside of the plate which was pretty gross. As soon as you lifted up the plate there were, brown, black spots, and old food stuck to the outside. Dirty!",

It comes with home fries and toast and all portions are generous.  I asked for some green Cholula sauce but they only had green tabasco which is not nearly as good.  My husband's experience has been hit or miss.  Today was not outstanding.  He ordered his eggs \"over medium\" but they were served runny.  The server did not stop by soon enough to ask if he was satisfied, so he ate the runny eggs.  When she did stop by, she offered to have the cook remake the eggs, but he declined.  Nevertheless, she did ask the chef to remake the eggs and the second attempt was even runnier.  She then offered a free bagel for him to take home.  His chicken fried steak looked pre-formed rather than hand breaded and the gravy on top was so-so.  He really enjoyed the crispy hash browns and the jalapeno cheese bagel that accompanied his entree.  Prices are a bit high, so when food is not perfectly prepared and/or served, it is frustrating.  The server was adequate, but not especially accommodating or friendly.",

I ordered some soup and shortly after could hear some people in the kitchen hustling to make it for me because they had already started cleaning things up. I could tell they were shutting down and I felt a little bad.  Then my waitress, named Kara, was the bomb. She was extremely friendly. She didn't rush me at all. She even said, \"Don't rush, we still have work to do.\" Her genuine cheerfulness made me feel better about coming in so late. She also offered me water as I left.  I gave her a good tip, but after I left I realize I added it up incorrectly. I checked the transaction online just now and they didn't put my tip on it at all. Maybe this is because she felt bad that I initially felt a bit rushed? Or maybe this is a policy that if the customer (me) adds it up incorrectly they just take it off completely? I'm going with the former.  The food is always good and my soup was very yummy, as was my cake.  Kara rocks. She made my evening.",

Waitress was somewhat inattentive, asked her for sauces with our food and to adjust the thermostat (it was freezing) and she appeared annoyed.

He called me and said \"I feel like I'm in a Jewish Deli at home (NY)!\" Makes sense, since the family that owns Chompie's is from Queens.   Since then, he finds any excuse he can to go, and we've had a variety of delicious items: the aforementioned soup; turkey sandwich; turkey dinner; potato knish; Mish Mosh Soup (Matzoh Ball, Chicken Noodle, and Kreplach mixed!) rainbow cookies, black & white cookies (free with Yelp! check in) Linzer tarts, butter cookies, fruit tart, onion strings, and kashe varnishkes. Only the last two disappointed: the strings were oil logged, and Scott didn't care for the varnishkes.   I had their bagels a few years ago when I was in Scottsdale for a conference, and they were super. They offer a wide variety of flavors, gluten free options, and lots of delicious cream cheese varieties. Their lox and whitefish offerings are stellar. They have extensive catering options and make custom cakes for special occasions.   They serve Gulden's mustard :) We are fans!  * sign up for Chompie's Reward card to accrue points, receive specials, and a free (dine-in only) breakfast on your birthday *   ** Friday is All You Can Eat Fish & Chips day! **  *** soups of the day vary, but Matzoh Ball/Mish Mosh is always available ***  **** the sandwiches are HUGE!

They have a huge selection of egg dishes -- omelets, skillets, benedicts, Latin inspired -- and I have not been disappointed with much here. The coffee is alright, but my friend and I realized that one hazelnut and one french vanilla creamer per cup make for an excellent combination. Many of the dishes, the Cabo Skillet being my favorite, come with your choice of bagel. The bagels are great here, of course! I recommend the Jalapeno Cheddar bagel to complete the breakfast.  Side-note: My guest ordered the Chompie's French Toast, which is both battered and fried. It was good, but only order this if you regularly enjoy donut breakfasts. I will stick to the higher-protein options!",

Zach was our server during our most recent visit, and he definitely made our morning! He's super personable and attentive, and makes the absolute best mimosas. You can't really go wrong with anything on their menu, though my favorites are their skillets. Nearly every dish here comes with a bagel and cream cheese, and you really can't go wrong with any of them. And guys, they have a CRAGEL - croissant bagel. This is not a drill. Throw some honey almond or strawberry cream cheese on there and I'm in heaven! They also have a couple solid breakfast specials during the week if anyone is thrifty like me - standard eggs/potatoes/bagel or bagel and lox. Make sure you stop by their deli/bakery counter for some goodies before you leave - the cannoli and the rugulach are SO GOOD. They also have a decent variety of gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free black and white cookie!",

The food is normally great.  5stars for the Matzo ball soup and for the sliders.  But seriously, where is management in this location?  Every time we walk in it's an uncomfortable welcome.  When asked, we say 2 for dinner.  And rather than a \"please follow me\", they grab the napkin set and a couple of menus and start walking off.  We never heard nor know to follow until they turn around, annoyed that they had to call you to follow them.  And rather than asking at the counter if you would like a table or both, you are awkwardly asking as you are standing in the middle of the dining room.    It's VERY apparent that management has not done their staff justice in proper service training which in turn lacks in the service to your customers.    I encourage the owners and managers to help make this place shine!  Show pride in your establishment and reflect the respect you have for it.  Be a leader and share your knowledge with your staff to set them up for success!  Right now, your not doing them any good and this reflects on you directly.    Don't know where to start, I'd be happy to come in and show you!  This location can and should be the greatest and I'd do anything to see it shine the way it should!",

I had one full on disappear for long periods of time as if she were eating a meal back there, because she definitely wasn't serving any other tables. I had another server who hardly checked in on us. The tables, silverware, and seats have been dirty each time I have been here.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love the idea of this establishment. The decor is New York inspired and has the feel of a diner. There is a baker on one side and seating in the other.   When you enter there are refreshments and bread with some type of spread. I assume this is for when there are long waits, by we didn't get a chance to try them. We were seated and our orders were taken pretty quickly.    The coffee was very delicious. It was very hot and strong. Our waitress was attentive and even took our trash that accumulated from preparing our coffee. *My boyfriend and I both noticed it as one of our pet peeves is waiters who let sugar packet and tiny creamer pots pile up. :)   The food was underwhelming. I ordered the buffalo eggs benedict. The bread it is served on was too hard and cold to enjoy, the hollandaise sauce was plain with the exception of a drizzle of buffalo sauce. My boyfriend selected a steak skillet breakfast. He really enjoyed it but the bagel given on the side was disappointing. He asked for a chives spread and was given cream cheese with chunks of chives.   At the end of breakfast we unlocked the cookie offer and were positively surprised.   Might be back but will definitely be trying something else. Overall this place deserves a 3.5 star rating.",

I went there on my two month quest for a real napoleon pastry. I had tried a couple specialty bakeries even driving an hour each way only to be thoroughly disappointed. And I tried a few other places without success. Spent many hours searching online. Finally found Chompies reporting they had them. Stopped after an appointment near by and there was a beautiful display of gorgeous napoleons - large and small. Not only were they perfect on the outside, they were perfectly tasty. Chompies is THE place in Phoenix area to get a real napoleon. The menu is so inviting, I stayed for a Philly cheese steak with coleslaw, and the chef's choice cup of soup. Sandwich was very good. Coleslaw can be not so good. This was good! The soup was a spicy tomato with chunks of carrot and potato. It was a bit too spicy for me but others would probably like that. If all of this wasn't great enough, they have a patio which I asked and found out it is dog friendly! I will definitely be back. And will be back when it isn't raining with one of my huskies.",

I literally ordered a ham sandwich and it took at least 30 minutes to get it. I ordered it on multigrain bread, I got regular bread. I asked for lettuce, no lettuce. I asked for American cheese, it showed up with cheddar. I asked for all potato salad and no coleslaw, I got coleslaw. Pretty much just the ham part of the order was correct and it only cost me $12! Then I sat there for another 20 minutes waiting on my check. It was such a simple order. I could have gone to the grocery store and spent $12 and gotten the same ingredients that would have made 5 of the same meals correctly. You pay for the convenience but they didn't even do that right.",

When I called, I was put on hold for about 4-5 minutes for almost every question I had about the reservation because each person had to ask the manager. Why they didn't just have the manager speak directly to me or have the manager call me back at a later time was beyond me.   Given the large number of our party, I figured would at least get the courtesy of speaking to someone who could give me pricing and requirements for the party - if not over the phone right then and there, maybe a few days later. But, instead, I got the \"someone will call you a week before the party date\" brush-off. I mean, c'mon - I was reserving FIVE MONTHS in advance! Could I at least get answers from someone well beforehand?! Needless to say, I quickly changed my mind and we decided to have our event elsewhere.  We were disappointed that we couldn't have our event there because we love the food ... But with how difficult it was to get answers, it just wasn't worth it. Subpar service like that would have ruined our celebration.",

Service was nice, but I would have to give this place 3.5 stars. The food was not good for me. I ordered the Arizona eggs Benedict and felt the bagel it was on was too dry and hard. I was wanting something softer and buttery with the egg. My hubby got a different eggs Benedict and said his was too salty. My girls pancakes were very cute, but overcooked.   We took some cookies to go which definitely is the highlight here. They are super buttery and delicious! They are dipped in chocolate with sprinkles, yum! We took an elmo cupcake to go from my daughters to split which they loved. Next time I visit I'll try something different and hope from a better outcome. Cookies are good though!",

Totally perfect for when you're not feeling so well.  Its even great when you feel fine.  The Pastrami is great too.  My favorite sandwich is their Reuben with Pastrami (you can get it with corned beef).  Their potato pancakes are served with applesauce and sour cream.  I adore them.  And don't get me started on their fantastic Jewish Sliders.  Love Seinfeld?  You'll find many episode goodies here.  Black & white cookies (Look to the cookie Elaine), chocolate bobka (They're going in first with the last bobka), cinnamon bobka (Cinnamon takes a back seat to no bobka).",

Overall, good friendly service but really, really poor quality food.   Also, check out the bathrooms if you need another reason to stay away.

He was sorry to hear we had a problem as he explained how they handle their products. My issue centered around the rotated stock since I \"asked are they fresh\" first. Zach gave us new fresh cookies, so as far as  I'm concerned he took care of my issue. :OLD REVIEW: The large Black & White cookies were NOT fresh today 9/14/2016. I asked before purchase if these were fresh today, soft insides--Yes they were just put out. They rotated stock and I got the old ones. Fresh black & white cookies are soft, The ones I was given were very firm when cut open at my house--not soft or fresh. I'll be back in their location next week and will raise the issue of lying about product's freshness. I'll update on the outcome.",

My pastrami was not hot and my wife's reuben was hot - it actually was a pastrami sandwich. Not knowing how they serve it, we just ate it anyway. Also to add the Jewish rye for the hot (so called) hot pastrami was falling apart. Not more than 15 minutes of leaving the place my stomach started to hurt and I had to use the restroom. Safe to say we will not be dining here or other locations anymore. It's weird how one location can ruin it for all the other locations.",

The service was wonderfully attentive especially the manager Christopher who went above and beyond to take care of us when my husband's order arrived undercooked.  The helpings are enourmous- seriously you can eat all weekend on one entree- and there is so much to choose from it is hard to pick- especially the dessert options.  I personally had the Orignal Jewish Sliders with gravy and I LOVE LOVE that dish- the flavors and textures are all perfectly comfortable and delicious.    We will be back for sure!",

The person taking the order was not helpful, did not know the menu and was completely rude. When I arrived at the restaurant I waited a few minutes before someone helped me. I told them I had a carryout. After a few more minutes the employee came out and said they did not have any corned beef and it would take awhile to prepare. She said the corned beef was in the pot and would take some time to finish. She ask if we wanted to come back or order something else. Why did she take my order on the phone and not tell me at that time they had no corned beef. Having me drive there and then stating they do not have any is ridiculous. They have lost a valued customer and I cannot recommend this location.",

I had heard all about the Jewish Sliders from Man vs. Food so those were a must. But I'm a huge fan of Eggs Benedict so I could decide which to get. Then add soon as I seen you could add a slider to any entree I was excited!! My wife had the Patty Melt and Fries and she said it was good, not to die for but good (it's hard to top the Patty Melt from Johnny Rockets). My Benedict was great! The Hollendaise Sauce was so good I didn't even use ketchup for my Hash Browns. Even the leftovers were great the next day back home!! But there's so much more to try there that I can't wait to go back. Plus the location is great, near so many things to do. I'll see you again soon Chompies!!",

Upon arriving you walk into the bakery!!! So the bakery treats look delectable- I had a sample of a delicious Danish.  For my dinner I chose blueberry pancakes which I wasn't impressed by.  A scarce amount of berries in the center only of a huge pancake that filled the plate. The portion was generous but I make better pancakes at home! Plus I *thought* there would be blueberry syrup but nope it's regular maple syrup so that was disappointing too. It's kinda expensive in my opinion too. My 2 stack of pancakes were $12. Kids meals were \"ok\", again great portions but lacking in taste.  My friend had sliders which honestly looked amazing- especially the western version. If I ever return I'll have that but doubt I'll give it a second try.",

Ask the waitress who was super annoying why the sandwich was cold if it started it was a hot pastrami sandwich. She replied it wasn't supposed to be hot.  Wierd???!!!!! Wont be back. Plus we literally had to wait over 45 minutes for cold sandwich",

To begin, we were given pickles as a bit of an appetizer for free. The manager came to our table a couple of times to check on us, and she was very sweet and informative. She suggested that we try an Arnold Palmer with pink lemonade and iced tea which was absolutely delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and my mom ordered a chicken ranch sandwich - both of which were were very tasty. Right before we left, we stopped by the inside bakery and ordered some cookies which were also very delicious and affordable. The overall experience at this location was amazing, you can definitely tell that customer service is definitely at its prime here.",

The chicken noodle was way to heavy on celery and light on carrots and onion.    The turkey sandwich was a giant pile of turkey on thin torn bread, there was no balance and no spread.  The turkey itself was cooked and sliced decently but it was under seasoned.    I don't get the love for this place.",

I always order a bowl of matzo ball soup to bring home with me to eat the following day, we never finish our food but I like the left overs.   Its crowded, more so on the weekends,  but have you ever been to a deli in New York? They always seem to be packed, sometimes with lines out the door. The crowd doesnt bother me.   The only thing that really irks me here is we have regularly had bad/slow service. Like a drink never refilled or a side of something we didn't get that we served just before the bill after reminding them. So I am a little more agressive about flagging down my service here.   Again, I love it, its comfort and home food that I don't have to cook. I don't have friends who cook Jewish food, so this is my only shot in AZ unless I'm making it myself.",

The bowl of individually wrapped coffee creamers was COVERED in ants. We told the waitress and handed her the bowl and told her that the table probably needed to be wiped down. She said ok and didn't even look at the table. We told her again thinking she was just busy but she still didn't even look at the table. Then they sat people At a table infested with ants without even a wipe down. Blah. Next we ordered the Chompies Benedict and it was disgusting. It really looked like they slapped an egg on a bagel with a chewy piece of ham and poured cheese-wiz all over it... It was dis-gust-ing.  To make it even worse, the coffee tasted like cigarettes. We left having taken three bites out of our meal and the waitress didn't think twice. We paid the bill and went and ate breakfast somewhere else. It was a sad morning. I would NOT recommend going to this Chompies. Terrible experience.",

Now the bad:  -Seated at a dirty table -Tea tasted like sewer water -Eggs were cooked the wrong style (not what I ordered), and one was so undercooked that the eggwhite ran with the yolk. Not a good sign, didn't eat it. -Hollandaise was not lemony, rich, or buttery. It was worse than the stuff you make at home out of a packet. It basically tasted like someone made a roux and dyed it yellow. -General lack of interest in service   I did report the egg issue as politely as I could to my server, who empathetically said \"Awww,\" and then walked away.   If you review the glass-enclosed pastry area, you may be surprised to discover that literally everything in the case has been mislabeled- the fun game is trying to figure out what is what! (seriously, that's what we did while waiting for our dirty table.)  I hope I just caught them on a bad day, because it was really, really bad.. but they will still get my bagel custom. These bagels seriously rule.",

I however chose to have non-breakfast (cup of vegetarian split pea soup and a half lite albacore sandwich). It was nice that lunch was available that early. Portions are quite generous. My brother had the biggest pastrami/corned beef/brisket sandwich I've ever seen. I submitted a picture. He loved it. Our server was prompt and steady.  What compelled me to write this review was the bakery/deli section on the other side of the restaurant. I submitted a picture too. Dessert selection was great and everything looked delicious. I asked about a decadent looking chocolate cake and the very nice man running the deli took out a slice and gave me a large piece to sample. Then he gave me another chocolate pastry he thought I may like. After that I didn't need dessert! But we bought a few pastries to take home including a very intricate minion cake. This gentleman was so friendly. I think that is a great way to get people's business. All the desserts we brought home were very good. If I lived here I would come back again and again for the desserts alone.",
