So needless to say we turned around.   After entering the restaurant he realized it wasn't the same establishment but we decided to give it a shot.  Atmosphere is very dark with dim lighting and very simple.  He ordered the pork chop which was seasoned perfect.  I ordered the salmon which was unbelievable.   It came with brussel sprouts which were scrumptious....I could have ate more!   We both had mashed potatoes that had a good flavor but were cold.  Would go back but not on the top of my list.",

There are 2 appetizers that I get every year, the artichoke dip and the smoked salmon.  Very tasty.  The Hawaiian rib eye is to die for!  We have tried and tried to replicate it and have not had any success. The one drawback this year was the waiter.  I felt like he was trying to turn the table and I felt rushed.  He kept grabbing the plates before we were done and didn't ask if we wanted to take the leftovers home.  A little rude, but did not dimish the overall experience due to the food.  We were seated by the \"entertainment\" and it was a little hard to talk, but they weren't bad.",

The service is always 5 star the quality of food and preparation is excellent. A couple of our favorites include the grilled artichoke, house salad, Ahi Tuna appetizer, grilled chicken and kale salad, house made veggie burger (one of my all time favorites) and the chicken tortilla soup is the best of anywhere. We visit every couple months and they never let us down. Make sure to go early as there is usually a wait, but it is worth it.",

Glad he told us to go here (and he also told us about \"The Breakfast Club\" - another WIN!).   We got there pretty early on a weeknight - 6:15ish (?) - and there was already a LONG wait.  Many retired folks go here I think... so they probably start arriving at about 5? Note to self, go earlier next time if with kids.  We got the kids shirley temples and an appetizer, and waited for maybe 30 minutes for our table.  Got to do some fabulous people watching while we waited! I could have SWORN they must have the \"HOUSEWIVES OF SCOTTSDALE\" there that night (if there were such a thing). We were standing right next to 3 of them, I say jokingly.  They were of course very nice and charming... but I had to laugh to myself that they could film that show here.  Got seated - and the food was fabulous! I had the ahi tuna salad (was torn between that or the thai noodle salad, but daughter voted for this one and I think I was going to share some with her, is why I must have let her help me decide this time?). Amazing. Ate it all.  Hubby got their hickory burger and chowed down. Kids liked whatever they got too.   So glad we went here and waited to get a table when we were all famished after a long day of watching some major league baseball. Worth the wait!",

Much more like a TGI Fridays.   Was told the sushi menu was discontinued since Hillstone opened across town.   As I've said previous experience has always been pretty great for Houston's.

I have not tried the apple cobbler myself but it has come highly recommended.... The bar had a wonderful atmosphere when busy and you can eat there too. Sometimes a better option of restaurant packed. They do not take reservations for parties over 4 so depending the night the wait could be very long. I would advise eating later to reduce the wait.",

But the most intriguing and spectacular thing was the wait staff.  They believe in a team based service.  Everyone was helping clear dishes, refill drinks, etc.  They all walked tall and sophisticated.   It was clearly the best experience we have had.  The final touch was the hot fudge sundae.  Not a normal canned fudge.  They make it homemade with Belgium chocolate.  Most delicious.  I would highly recommend Houstons and the hot fudge sundae.",

We sit at the bar, have ice tea and lunch. We go up to the bar and begin taking a seat when the bartender asks me if I have another shirt as they do not allow tank tops.  Everyday for the past 25 years in my own business I wear a company tank top and gym shorts.  I gave up the suit and tie a long time ago.  In the approximately 3,750 times I have eaten lunch out in the past 25 years I have NEVER been told I could not be there due to my tank top.  It was clean, no stains and I am clean cut and clean shaven.   To top it off the two women next to us were wearing tank tops?  Well, the joke is on them because every week my wife and mother -in-law meet for dinner there.  I get the credit card bill so I know that HOUSTON'S will now be short an average of $208 per week as the ladies will no longer be going there. We went across the lot to the tap house and had a nice lunch and the manager laughed at our houston's story and was glad to have our business.  I highly recommend the TAP HOUSE.  I have told literally ALL of my friends to cease going to HOUSTON'S because apparently if you are a successful contractor you are NOT welcome there if you are dressed casual.  Seriously, who does Houston's think they are?  It is not the Ritz Carlton for crying out loud.",

This location is better than its counterparts: Hillstone, Bandera and Chelsea's kitchen. At least in the food department. The spinach dip and the French dip are a must. Hawaiian ribeye and the key lime pie!!! Just needs a full service patio.",

So we were ok, but then they came out with some fancy looking (not normal chicken fingers) thing it was not good at all and my kid was not happy so I think that they should implement a kids menu to make the place more family style so the whole family could enjoy! But the adults food was great I would recommend for adults but not kids until they get a kids menu!!",

When it was delivered I thought they had brought me the wrong meal.   The burger was cut into four pieces, each laying on its side, held together with a toothpick, like a club sandwich! Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to think again.  It is so awkward to pick up, everything was sliding out of it and made a big mess.  I had to eat it with a knife and fork and left the bits of roll.  The hot fudge sundae was, as always, absolutely delicious.  When I return it will be back to salad again.  The hostess and wait staff are very accommodating and nice.",

SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP -  \"Chicago-style\" with salsa and sour cream:  It is so good.  MUST order for an appetizer.    HAWAIIAN RIB-EYE - Pineapple sesame ginger marinade, grilled over hardwood, & loaded baked potato: The marinade for the rib-eye is so flavorful and make light crispy rust on the rib-eye.

To be fair the food was very good however the service ruined everything.  Our seemingly high-school aged waitress seemed outmatched for the task at hand, after serving our appetizer she was AWOL was over 20 minutes while we waited and waited and waited just to order dinner.  There were no busboys filling waters, no managers walking the floor, in fact there didn't seem to be an employee in the building over 16 years old.  Finally we placed our order and once served, two of the four entrees had to be sent back; one for the wrong temp and a plate of ribs was completely cold.  Then that was it for 20 minutes, she took the two meals and was AWOL again.  Now two of us were completely finished eating and still no sign of the other entrees or waitress (or busboy or manager or anyone else).  We finally figured out who the manager was and flagged her over to explain the situation.  I explained that the waitress had no help, no one running food, no one filling glasses, no manager checking on the patrons.  Although apologetic she threw the waitress under the bus and wholly blamed her.  Not only was this unprofessional it wasn't True, where the hell was the manager all night?  This was literally the first time we saw her on the floor.  Terrible service, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT, but maybe they don't teach managing restaurants until high school.  What a shame!",

Admiring each and every passing server; their hair slicked back tightly, bright red lipstick, and tight, form-fitting black skirt, I have to wonder if Houston's was Palmer's inspiration for his videos. It was truly a head-turning, awe-inspiring event.  Eat the ribs, best item on the menu, (and enjoy the fashion show!)",

We've know each other for years and still nothing is more irresistible than the crunch of their fresh Caesar salad with homemade croutons and dressing over Chet Baker's voice and some soft, mood lighting. This is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. I am always happy when I'm at Houston's; partially because I like to pretend I'm rich like 80% of their diners when I'm there.

I also ordered their coleslaw, which was also outstanding.  I think they included Kale in it, but the taste was simply amazing.  A big thank you to Kristyna H. our server.  She was amazing and made great recommendations and was a pleasure to talk with all night.  While it is pricey, you tend not to mind when the food is this good.  We also shared a brownie, which was insanely good.  Massive recommendation to this place.",

I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Definitely will be coming back again!",

    "text": "1 star for the very good food. Minus 4 stars because I've been coming here for years but this last visit was a comedy of errors & rushed rudeness. For starters, the hostess said our table would be ready in 10 minutes, so my wife and daughter went to the restroom to freshen up and literally 10 SECONDS later the hostess says \"your table is ready.\" Now I have to awkwardly wait for my wife and daughter to return from the restroom while the hostess waits for all of us  (why not just tell me the table was ready now in the first place?). But that was just the minor start of it. The hostess then gave us menus and said \"I'll take your drink order.\" Well, I like to calmly peruse the wine list before I make a drink decision, but her staring silent daggers at me while I make a decision left me feeling rushed, so I just quickly chose whatever.  Then the waitress, a very tall blonde, commenced to literally and figuratively look down on us the rest of the night.  She was impatient, short with us in her manner, and sounded like she was barking answers at us. When my wife wanted a certain side, she yelled \"That counts for 2 sides!\" When we asked what that meant, she said \"You have to take away the broccoli too, or else you need to pay extra!\" We said ok we'll pay extra, jeesh. She proceeded to stop by literally once during the dinner to quickly ask if we needed anything, but before my daughter barely got the word \"ketchup\" out of her mouth, the waitress was gone. God forbid the rest of us needed something, because she didn't bother to wait and let us answer her question. Then she hurriedly explained the desserts, hurriedly brought the check while we were eating it (without asking if we wanted more wine or anything else), took my credit card for an uncomfortably long period of time, then came and swiped her tip off the table while we were still sitting there enjoying our wine. I'm no fancy pants, but I'm pretty sure that is considered rude, especially in a nice establishment like this. Even my teenage daughter commented: \"I don't think she likes us very much.\" In summary, we felt rushed the entire evening, and like we were inconveniencing our waitress and taking a coveted table they needed to turn over ASAP.  This was a terrible visit and not what I expect when dropping nearly $300. Management should make some serious corrections here.",

We made the mistake of coming without reservations and waited the full one hour and a half to be seated. We contemplated leaving to another restaurant but figured we would wait. We patiently waited for our table as we saw multiple customers being seated. During that time we were able to make observations on the way people were dressed. Most people were dressed for the occasion others were not. For example, flip flops with socks and hoodie, tank tops, and T-shirt's and gym shorts.   When it was our turn to be seated the hostess then decided to tell me that I would have to remove my hat once in the dining area.  I guess my button down and nice jeans weren't good enough. Next time I should wear flip flops with socks and a hoodie.   What I don't understand is why the hostess took an hour an half to tell me I couldn't were my hat. Yet, they have a \"dress code\".  Not even Bobby Flays restaurant Gato in NYC is this strict.",

I explained that I have an 82 year old and 91 year old in our party so a table would work best. They said they have tables for parties of five but only take reservations for parties of four and below. I asked why they could not take a reservation for a party of five if they have tables for parties of five and their only explanation was they only had a few tables for parties of five so they only allow parties of four or less to reserve those tables. So my only options would be to bring the 82 year old who is walking with a cane and my 91 year old mother who can not walk without assistance and stand around and wait for a table to open up. Mind you this is 1:30pm on a Tuesday in Scottsdale in June where all the snowbirds have been fleeing town for months. There was zero accommodation from the hostess. She held hard and fast that only parties of four or less can reserve a table. OF course I understand that the restaurant has the right to make these rules but it will be a cold day in hell before I ever eat at this restaurant.",

The food is wonderful the service fantastic, I love coming here as I can hide out and unwind from a long day  Best of all no one bothers you if you want to be left alone, The ambience is old school charm dress up with put being stuffy, you can carry a convo with out shouting or screaming, and enjoy some wonderful food perfect for a dsate night or even a solo relaxing dinner,  The food:so fresh and tasty made to order not made ahead yay! Today I changed it up, from my usual  Flying chicken with a side of fries and a club soda Haven't tried it yet but it sounds amazing!!  My usual go to is the artichoke (availability is limited due to season) *they won't serve it if the crop is bad so call ahead!* Smoked salmon, and fries with a Sazarac drink. I'm looking forward to a change can't wait to tuck in.. Oooh first taste of the flying chicken absolutely amazing so light and flavorful, nice moist and crispy, with a light tempura batter served with coleslaw,  Yummy a perfect change from my go to usual  I'll definitely order it again",

The vinaigrette with blue cheese was one of the best dressings I have ever had. The salad was packed with fresh veggies, eggs and bacon. A truly delicious meal and we can't wait to go back!",

I know it doesn't sound as exciting as the prime rib sandwich or freshly caught wild salmon, but just order this and you will see why. The honey mustard peanut sauce is the best I've ever had.

They allowed us to order and then told us all of the dishes they were out of. Two of the five things they were out of were my wife's top two choices.  Would've been nice to know when they gave us the menus.   I went with a steak, which was fine, but awkward as she had to settle for chicken tenders. The grilled artichoke was on point, though. I ordered a beer. It never showed up. My wife asked for a cocktail menu. They said they didn't have one but they could make whatever.   Our waitress seemed disinterested and barely checked on us. The food server said nothing to us and gave us an icy stare. We spent $75 to have a celebration meal that we very much regretted. Next time I'll remember to spend the extra dough on Ruth's Chris or save $10 and go to Charleston's. I've never had a bad experience at either one.   Don't get me wrong, the food that they did have in stock was decent, but it wasn't worth the price once you factor in the apathetic service and the LOUD atmosphere.",

I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye and omg!!!! It was definitely the best steak I have had so far! It was mouthwatering and the flavor is laced throughout the whole meat. It was a good sized piece, 12 oz probably, and it was so good that I finished it all. I can't wait to go back and have more soon! The spinach dip is yummy too! Wasn't a fan of the five but brownie though, that is why I am giving this place a 4.5 instead of a 5. Not sure how to give half stars. Either way... I'm coming back for sure :)",

I have probably been here 20 times and NEVER had to send something back.  Their Crab Cakes are INSANELY good (although seasonal.. so not always available).  Their prime rib is good, the chicken is great.  I also like their grilled artichoke appetizer.  It's amazing.  Awesome bartenders - so the drinks are perfect.  The staff work together SO cohesively - you would never know whether someone is covering your table or not, because EVERYONE offers to take care of whatever you need.  WE LOVE Houston's.",

Talked up the artichokes only to be told not available but the Brussels sprouts were just as good.  They were not.  Dry bland, no one at table enjoyed.  Meals arrived in timely fashion and we're all good.  A few minutes into the meal 4 in our party were looking at a video on a cell phone.  Without notice waiter took/cleared 2 of the plates and walked away.  One being my own which was a burger with 2 bites taken out of it and had not touched the fries.  My client had eaten less than half of a french dip.    My client seemed embarrassed so I did not make a big deal or mention anything to waiter and we awkwardly joked about it. Not sure if we were being rushed or waiter just blew it.   On way out I discretely asked to speak to a manager.  Was told it would be a few minutes and with clients waiting outside in the heat, I left.  Pretty disappointed as was trying to make good impression with clients.",

My friend next to me order the Pork Beef Ribs and we decided to tag team -- we felt like we were eating a whole animal. The Pale Ale swished all excess down nicely. For dessert, we couldn't help it: We got the ice cream sundae and we got first-rate hot fudge served from an ol' fashioned Gravy Boat. Decadence.  This particular Houston's in Scottsdale, AZ has good live music Thursday thru Saturday nights. Cool Kats. Hey, to be straight- up about it: This Scottsdale, AZ location is the best \"Houstons\" I've ever been to, by far.",

Service we have never had a bad experience 5 stars. Drinks are made correctly 5 stars. The only 2 issues are as follows.  1. Pricing has gone up over the past 2 years. Used to be we could come here on a more regular basis and now it is more of a special occasion type visit. Not sure why the price hike but whatever it has not reduced traffic so it will most likely not change.  2. The wait sucks. If you walk in during prime hours expect 30+ min wait easy. We make reservations and usually wait 10-15 min past our reservation time. They have a great patio but do not use it? They have a large piano area and I have never seen anyone play that damn thing. You can add 4-5 tables if you get rid of that thing.  Highly recommended if you are ok with a wait and paying a little more than normal for a really good meal.",

Now this is not a high end restaurant so having wine prices starting at $11.00 for a cheap wine you can get at Total Wine for about $7.00 a bottle is a bit much!  Also charging $10.00 for a house rum and coke is also a bit much when the rum tastes watered down. You can get a Bacardi (if drink it you can tell the difference) and coke at a much better restaurant for $6.00 or $7.00, REALLY? Cannot recommend this place and I know we will never be back.  There are much better restaurants in Scottsdale where you won't get ripped off and the food is much, much better!",

I asked for a non-sugar based martini muddled with cucumbers and even though they had cucumbers in the kitchen they would not use them to make a drink!  . Management came out and one woman felt badly because we were leaving.  She seemed so helpful and brought out the restaurant manager who explained they cannot deviate from anything even if the other locations will accommodate guests.

The first thing that captured my attention was the lighting throughout. The dining room  chandeliers resemble great big pine cones! Now that might not mean alot to some, but it makes a little mountain girl like me feel right at home. The entire staff is top notch. So attentive, the entire team just Blesses you from the moment you arrive. Our waitstaff was just charming. Her name is Shereen. She is very professional,  knowledgeable of the menu and has a style all her own. Today I had a Crispy Chicken Salad. Amazing! I have never had lightly-breaded crispy chicken so tender and juicy it melts in your mouth... My friend had a Hickory Burger with homemade fries - piled high with cheddar and bacon. Plate presentation is phenomenal. No matter how hungry you are, I can only imagine that once your meal arrives, that you will be delighted and literally stunned long enough to remember to get a picture. I will highly recommend to all. Do keep in mind ~ if time is a constraint for you, might call ahead.",

Three of us had the ribs and we were in pork heaven & the other three tried the salads ...what a fantastic meal, not to mention the chocolate sundae and apple cobbler ! What we all raved about was the consistency of Houston's and how it is a staple here in Scottsdale, ambience..staff& food quality make this establishment a MUST!",

Light and crispy almost the way calamari is fried. The slaw that came with it was refreshing  (look at me with my descriptive words) and not too dressing type. My wife's burger, in my opinion, left me wanting and needing water due to being a little on the dry end for me. She liked it, I didn't what else is new in marriage. Anyhow, I'd recommend coming here for a good meal that is served in a very timely manner.",

The golden rule is always make sure take out orders are correct,  because once a customer gets home and finds out the order is wrong, it's very, very difficult to fix the problem.  I have been going to Houston's for over 15 years.  And when dining in , it's almost certainly an excellent experience.  This time I ordered takeout,  and all items were incorrect, meat extremely undercooked and requested condiments did not accompany the order. I know better than to leave a restaurant without checking my order. But when you pay nearly $20 for a well done burger you don't expect to wait 40 min, when you are told 20, and you don't expect that your burger will be nearly raw when you get home.  Houston's is known for consistency and quality food. Normally I would give a \"hall pass\" on this one, but nothing makes me angrier than paying top dollar and having to go home to recook undercooked food, only to then throw it out. I will be back to Houston's, for dine in only. Take out, never again.",

I always start with the spinach dip or the artichokes, sometimes both if my party is big enough. I always top it off with the ice cream sundae, which is just out of this world. Hot gooey fudge that you can pour on yourself and candied nuts.. mmmmmm...   My most recent experience was nearly ruined by a loud mouth wearing a T-Shirt and dining with a rather trashy looking gal. He was telling lude stories about his recent trip to Vegas and the volume of his voice was less than appropriate for the dimly lit, laid back atmosphere Houston's provides. I flagged down a server nearby and she kindly relocated me to the other side of the restaurant.   I really wish they had a dress code here to keep scrubs like that from ever ruining classy folk's meals. Thanks again though, to the staff!",

    "text": "Oh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  I took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.  The service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!  I was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.  My other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a> That's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.  For sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.    Another tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.  Return Factor - 100%",

With that said, the ambiance is awesome.  The rest of our meals were great.  We will give it one more try next year, hopefully they will liven up the menu a little.",

However the last two years or so it's safe to say it's no longer the same place. From the less and less steak in the Tai Steak and Noodle salad (today was 3 to 4 dime size pieces) to not cooking my Hawaiin Ribeye right at least for the last 6 visits in a row. It's just all gone downhill. DEMITRE the manager has apologized to me numerous times (basically every visit for the last 2 years) that it's become almost comical now. I know it's not just me either because I have numerous friends that will no longer go and eat there as well. So it's sad to say it was a good run while it lasted but unfortunately I'm done with this place. We paid $77 and $87 with tip for 2 Tai Steak and Noodle Salads and 2 drinks. The Salads were almost half of the size they use to be and like I said it was like trying to find gold to come across some steak in there. So there you have it almost $90 for probably my worst meal ever there. Thanks for the good times and I'm sorry we've gotta part ways like this. By the way Sebastian I believe is his name and hes the manager that came to appologize tonight but it was almost unbearable to listen to. Thanks again !!!",

Once he finished mine arrived and he watched me eat mine. This isn't the experience I wanted. The bill came, we paid and left. I'm surprised for a nice restaurant like Houston's that nothing was offered. If this was my table I would have said, \"I apologize for the inconvenience and we'd like to offer you a complimentary dessert.\" If the table turned it down, I would have asked a manager to comp their drinks. A manager even brought me my meal, so he was aware of the situation. Honestly, the first plate should have never been served.",

We split the blue cheese wedge salad served with bacon and beets. It was delicious and was plenty for my husband and I to split. My husband got the prime rib with seasonal veggies (beets with goat cheese) and the braised red cabbage. The prime rib was okay but wouldn't order it again. However the beets and cabbage were perfect. I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with loaded baked potato. My ribeye was one of the best I've EVER had. I didn't eat any of the potato because I was stuffed, but it was large, crusted with sea salt and loaded up with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. The service was also exceptional. Two really cool things happened that we hadn't experienced before. 1 - while sipping on the martini, the server cane over and poured it into a new frozen martini glass. 2 - when packing up our meal to go the server asked us if we'd like fresh sides and brought out brand new side dishes and packed them up to go. This was one of our best date night, and the prices are much more reasonable than many of the higher end restaurants we've visited. Well done - we will be back!!!",

I hate how rude they are about this, it's a bar during the day I'm not ruining anyone experience there.  The lady bartender was very good, generous pour and very professional.   My dad loves the ribs.   The burger was pretty dry though, not sure why any kitchen would EVER cut a burger, especially into 4 pieces and serve it that way. Sad they don't realize this. If you are going to cut my burger into 4 pieces without telling me, I should at least be able to wear my hat backwards if I want, or even my underpants on my head cus that's about the equivalent.   If my dad didn't like this place, and the bartender didn't have a generous pour, my rating would be much lower.",

There's something on the menu for everyone. Grilled artichokes are a favorite starter. The salads are fresh and varied. Entrees including salmon, double-cut pork chops and burgers, are great.  Try the key lime pie for dessert-you won't be disappointed.  Service is very good.  The bar is fully stocked and well-run; you can dine there if you like. Ask for a booth (tough to score one) but definitely call ahead or reserve your table online. It's a very popular dining destination.",

We were looking for a last minute place to go and chose Houston's because we had been to both Bandera and Hillstone and loved them both. We showed up without a reservation at 8:30 on a Saturday night. We had to wait 10-15 to be seated. There was plenty of room at the bar so we had a drink while we waited. The restaurant is very nice on the inside although it is a little dark. I ordered the ribs with cole slaw and french fries. My girlfriend ordered the chicken with a  baked potato and broccoli. We were both extremely happy with our selections. The chicken may be the best chicken I have ever had. It is so juicy and full of flavor. The ribs were also excellent. We had a great experience and will certainly come back!!",

I ordered it medium well, when it arrived it was bloody. Then I noticed that the Canadian bacon had been replaced with some limp fatty bacon.  I would never quibble about paying 15 dollars, because it was that good.  There was a very small serving of limp greasy fries.  What happened? Is Houston's trying to save a few pennies on my burger? I would rather spend $16 on a quality burger. That is why I have been so loyal to Houstons.  Now let me move on to the service. I feel like I walked into a different restaurant. I waited 10 minutes with an empty glass before I had to flag down whoever I could find.  After I received the disappointing burger, I asked if I could exchange it for the French dip. They obliged and of course upped my charge to $19.  French dip had also changed, now they have gone with a piece of french  bread as opposed to the prior oversized croissant.  Not sure I am coming back.  Such a sad day for me.",

Tonight it was different. Our server did not know anything about wine to the point of bring terribly misinformed. She had been well coached though and every wine she \"recommended\" was $15 per glass. I ate the pork filet which was good. I asked her if they had brought the rose back that they used to carry. She then promptly recommended a riesling since she equated rose with white zinfandel with sweet. Definitely no knowledge of wine.  The wine list itself has become tired and for the most part features the same old wine they have been serving for years . They try to picture their list as being interesting and eclectic but it is simply a bit bizarre, old and musty.  What really got my goat was that I ordered an aperitif, sweet vermouth, up. When I got the bill they charged me $12 for it. The same price as their martinis with the exception that there was no vodka or gin. The server went to talk to the bar when I complained and she came back to tell me that vermouth is a spirit and therefore the price should be the same as a cocktail. Any idiot knows that vermouth is an aromatised wine and not a spirit. I could buy an entire bottle of vermouth for $12. I never complain about restaurant prices but I guess even I have a limit on being gouged.  They are slowly becoming a formula restaurant and at +$50 per head I demand more.  They treated me like a moron, took me for granted and I can assure you I am not.",

It's a smaller bowl though so if you have more than 2 people eating I suggest more than one. The ribs and steak are the best I have ever had. Seriously. I am not a rib fan, but when I tried these, I changed my mind completely. It is very expensive but it is worth the money for the amazing food, atmosphere, and a special night out!",

Cheese butter with a touch of lemon.   The bad. Spacing, they cram 4 tops in what is designed for two. And they serve soda in bottle form. So you are not getting free refills.

    "text": "Ok. So my wife and I eat at Houston's several times a month. I always have the cheeseburger done medium well (no overcooked jokes please). Last night we took our friends for dinner and drinks and I have to say it was disappointing from the start.   First, while waiting for a table we decided to begin what we thought would be our first of MANY margaritas, however, that didn't pan out because these were not the delicious frothy drinks we are so used to; instead, they were very strong (I know, why am I complaining about that?) but it wasn't like a 'too much tequila' strong, it was more like 'someone didn't make the mix right and the wrong flavors are coming out' strong. We switched our drinks and that was that.  Later, while seated at our table and as we waited for our food to arrive the waitress brought by a margarita made with a new (I suppose) batch of mix and..... yes! This one was done right so we ordered a few more.  So finally our food arrives. I am almost done eating the first half of my burger and then realize that the meat is very undercooked. I try to brave it and not complain again so I shove the last piece of that half's burger in my mouth and reluctantly swallow it. As I'm done chewing, the waitress stops by and I take the opportunity to show her my second half which is also undercooked. She agreed and said she will have it fixed.   Now I want to make something clear. I don't eat super pink/red meat for two reasons: 1. to me, it's gross and 2. I have Crohn's and have flared up from it before.  Anyway, along comes the manager, very apologetic, and puts in front of me A HALF OF A CHEESEBURGER! Yes, i assume it was the cheeseburger they took to finish cooking! My friends, my wife and I were in awe! We could not believe that 1. They took my burger apart, cooked the half of the cheeseburger, cut up HALF A BUN and added HALF THE CHEESE and HALF THE TOPPINGS and brought it to me!! 2. Lest I repeat they TOOK THE MEAT OFF MY PLATE, cooked it on the same grill where other people's food was being cooked and brought it back - how did they know I didn't lick it or spit on it? 3. This, from what Bon Appetit magazine called \"The Best Run Restaurant in the Country\"!  Wow! We were dumbfounded that Houston's wouldn't just replace it with a fresh new burger. I should mention they DID bring extra asparagus on the house.  Now, Houston's - or any restaurant for that matter, should appreciate feedback from customers like us. We are there many times each month and therefore, we know what to expect in terms of service and quality - this time, it was not up to par. Unfortunately, over the last few times it has not been up to par with things going wrong here and there. Sure everyone makes mistakes, but lately the mistakes have become more and more instead of less and this is why I can't, as much as I'd like to, give them 5 stars.   One last thing - a tip more so: when you ask for ketchup, make sure you ask them to \"fill it up\" otherwise they will bring you a half full container which won't be enough for your fries and I which think is so petty like maybe make more if you think you're gonna run out. Smh.",

Pleasant surprise.  We had reservations so I was disappointed to have to wait 15 minutes at arrival.  Server was friendly but service was not as special as I remembered.  Salt shaker was clogged and by the time someone brought a new one, food was just lukewarm.    We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and Ribs subbing baked potato for fries.  Ribeye on point and cooked perfectly.  Potato just like I remember in flavor, but glad now 1/2 the size.  Always thought the mammoth size of old was wasteful and overkill.  Problem solved.  Ribs were God too.  Other than slower service than we  like, good experience.  Definitely good flash back.",

    "text": "I've been going to Houston's for years. I don't go often but when I do the food has always been incredibly good. As it's a little pricey, It's always a treat to go and when I have ordered take out in the past, the presentation of the food has always been as good as if I were eating in the restaurant. From my experience last night, that has definitely changed. I ordered the salmon appetizer and the hickory burger. I got there early so it would be hot and I live maybe 10 minutes from the restaurant and got home and the entire meal was cold. The toast that came with the salmon and the fries that came with the burger were just thrown into brown paper bags which is probably why everything was cold. Very LOW CLASS which you wouldn't think would be synonymous with Houston's but it is. I called and spoke to Dimitri and surprisingly this is how they process take out orders. $15 for salmon and $16 for the burger and they think it's acceptable to throw food into paper bags. Tacky and again very low class. Sad when you see a restaurant that you once really, that valued their food, and service, go from 5 stars to 1 star. I'm doubting I will return,",

    "text": "We had not been to Houston's in a good number of years, but recalled our earlier visit was pleasant and the food very good.  Since we've been looking for a good prime rib restaurant, we decided to visit this location.  I was also impressed with their on-line dress code, which \"suggests\" collared shirts for gentlemen and specifically prohibits flip-flops.  That's a nice touch in this day of overly casual attire.  And, yes I do know its Phoenix and its hot out.  I also appreciated that they let it be known that their facility was not intended to cater to children.  Bring your own booster chair if you insist on bringing your kids to this restaurant.  It was pleasant not to be bothered by mewling little ones at nearby tables. The restaurant has a nice, old, dark wood, comfortable atmosphere.  We were impressed with the staff, all of whom took good care of us.  They all seemed to work in coordination with one another, taking care of a table's needs even if it was not theirs. I have to mention the fast service, too, or should I say \"express\" service.  After ordering our drinks and meals, our server left to turn in the food order and get our drinks.  I am not exaggerating when I state that a food runner brought our plates in less than 3 minutes from when our server took the order.  We had not had any time to converse or enjoy the ambiance when, BAM, BAM, two plates were dropped in front of us!! We were so shocked at the rapid fire delivery we felt that we must have been mistakenly given another table's order, so we didn't touch the food.  Several minutes later, our server returned with our drinks.  We noted to her that the food came so fast we thought a mistake had been made.  Nope, she said, those were our plates.  Okay.  Now, we had no time to relax and enjoy our beverages.  It was dig in and gulp everything down.   Talk about feeling rushed.  I would not have thought our server would have had time to enter our order, the cooks to prepare it, and the runner to bring it out to us all in less than 3 minutes.  That's faster than Taco Bell brings me food!!! Having said that, I give 5-stars to the prime rib.  It was excellent.  A large, maybe 16 oz piece, was cooked medium rare to perfection.  Good beefy flavor and minimal fat.  We were very well pleased with our meat. Note, too, that our food came out so fast that my wife's plate did not contain her vegetables.  It then took about 5 minutes for those to be delivered.  Why so slow now?  Also, our server had told me I could substitute one of my sides for a house salad.  I said I'd do that.  Well, she was wrong.  If you substitute for a salad, both of your sides are wiped out.  No potatoes, no veggies.  Hmmmm!  Had I known that I would have ordered a salad.  Just meat and about a 1/2 cup of lightly dressed greens on the plate.  How expensive can a 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes be? As good as the meat was I was surprised that there was no bread service.  No rolls, no flatbread, no biscuits, no butter, no nothing.  I guess it would not have mattered since our food came so quick we would not have had any time to butter a roll!  And, I was disappointed that the prime rib did not come with au jus or any other condiment, including the rather standard at most places, horseradish sauce.  I had to ask for the horseradish.  It was a nice complement to the dinner, but when was the last time you ordered prime rib and did not at least get au jus?? Houston's is one of the few restaurants that publishes a dress code for its patrons.  Apparently, it is honored more in the breach than in practice.  There were several guys in t-shirts and many more men were clopping around in flip-flop shower shoes that I would have imagined was possible.  There were some in sandals, but there were a lot in shower shoes.  C'mon, guys, I don't need to see your big ol' hairy toes while my wife and I are I trying to enjoy our $100 dinner.  Either have rules and enforce them, or don't make such a big deal out of having them. We were also disappointed with the dessert menu.  There is none.  Our server said they just had three items: key lime pie, some kind of 5-nut brownie, and a sundae.  Really? That's all?  Yep, that's it. I'll emphasize again that the prime rib was excellent, no question.  However, the service was just way too fast.  Our check was opened at 5:31 pm and our credit card was processed at 6:08 pm.  Considering the 3 minute food delivery time and 5 minutes to process the CC, I'd say we had about 20 minutes to relax and enjoy our meal.  I've had more leisurely meals at designated fast casual restaurants.  I could not help but feel that we were rushed in order to quickly turn the table for regulars, perhaps wearing t-shirts and flip-flops.  We just felt so rushed and unappreciated that I'm not sure we'd return.  Maybe they have the prime rib to-go!!?",

    "text": "Houston's has been one of my all time favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  It's not just the amazingly consistently delicious food they run out of their open clean kitchen.  It's the ambiance... the artwork, the live jazz bands, the fireplace, the candles, the beautiful wood that remains timeless and not to mention the smell of a wood burning oven.  It's nice to get out of the blazing sun and retreat to a cool place where it's relaxing atmosphere and excellent food welcomes you back, as you are greeted at the door by a smiling face.  Houston's seems to have a wonderful waitstaff that is extremely professional and attentive.  I have been to this locations several times and thought it was time I finally review it.  Since 2007 is when my love for Houston's developed.  I find their waitstaff is wonderful and provide the best consistent service through out the years.  AMAZING!!    Now let's talk food!!  One of my favorites is the Famous French dip.  Now I have also watched the price of this delicious sandwich go up and up through the years.  It's still worth it!!  Especially if you look at it as a special sandwich not one you'd want to eat every other day.  The special being, the tender rare perfectly seasoned prime rib sliced thin served on a delicious buttery, shiny,  french roll with au jus.  I love the horseradish with it!!  I love their french fries or the loaded baked potato.   Since I have been to Houston's many times over the years I have many favorites.  I love the Spinach artichoke dip. The grilled Artichokes, so great.  I have also had their smoked salmon-which is, smoked in house (I'm  told).  It's the best damn salmon ever!!   I will sometimes just order it as a meal. The variety of salads with fresh produce and combinations of exotic ingredients makes for great lunch.  Pick one, they are all amazing.  As of lately, I have tried a new sandwich they put on their menu called Ding's Crispy Chicken sandwich.  It was the BEST!!!  The coleslaw on the sandwich makes it cool and crunchy fresh.  The bun once again is just buttery and delicious.  It also is a nice size sandwich. Their burgers are great as well.  My boyfriend says they are one of the best, cooking it perfectly juicy. The flying Chicken and the BBQ pork ribs are some of my favorites.  The fish dishes are always fresh tasting including their fish sandwiches that are done to flaky perfection.  Their sauces are also great...house made and well seasoned, the green goddess sauce, the spicy garlic aioli to dip fries in are just the perfect compliment to the quality of food that's being dipped. Houston's has it covered all the way around.  That's what makes it a great place!!  They have paid attention to the smallest details that making dining a pleasure with them. Right down to the clean and modern restrooms they have exceeded all expectations.  I usually am to stuffed to enjoy their delicious desserts... however, I have had their apple walnut cobbler. It's seasonal.. in the fall.  It's truly a taste of fall. Just try it!!!   The key lime pie is really wonderful as well.  The coffee is the best in town.  The smell of it through out the restaurant is enough to make me order every time.  Houston's crosses it's T and dots it's I's in the restaurant/culinary world with every thing they do!!!  Thank you for your fabulous service and constant attention to detail, it shows!!!  I can't wait to come back again!!",

Definitely recommend getting reservations because even on a weeknight, every table was occupied including a two seater that had four people around it.",

I could not find our waitress so waved down another who took the plate.  The rest of us started to eat slowly to not finish before the other dinner. After 10 minutes we had to stop another waiter and ask for the meal. The manager brought the plate and the potatoes were cold.  We told him but just accepted it and ate it. Soon after we ran out of water and had to stop another waiter to get some water.  The waitress finally showed up and just asked if we wanted dessert, but we took the check. They gave us a credit on the one meal but overall a very poor dining experience.",

One member of our party ordered fish & chips and was told they don't have that item on Monday, 2nd member ordered a ahi tuna burger and was told they don't have that available either as \"we use the left over pieces of the tuna that are not pretty and there isn't enough to use today\".  What??!!  Third member ordered the ahi tuna salad (asking if the \"pretty\" parts of the tuna were used) and asked for dressing on the side.  Our waiter explained they could not accommodate that request but they could lightly dress it.  What??!!  The salad was served overly dressed (in my opinion) with the tuna served on the side.  Are the salads \"pre-dressed\"?  She ate the tuna, but not the salad.  I ordered the grilled artichoke - it was excellent.  Two members ordered the \"bean burger\" (which we were told is the best in the city) and thought it was ok.  I fault them - you ordered a bean burger!!!  Would I go back?  Maybe, not sure.  How can all these great reviews be wrong.  Left feeling guilty that I choose this venue to celebrate my friends special day.",

I found the more family-oriented crowd a refreshing change from the sometimes pretentious atmosphere of Los Angeles locations.  Friendly service, but some aspects were definitely not as polished as in LA.  In saying that, the sushi chefs had a full on conversation with my husband and I, whereas in other Houston's--you'll be lucky to get a smile from them.  The food was, of course, fabulous!  And they had one of our favorite wines on the list, Jeff Runquist.  The couple at the neighboring table also ordered the same bottle.  We ordered our favorite sushi, the coconut shrimp roll.  The consistency was all there!  Perfect, fresh and delicious.  Husband ordered the filet with a baked potato.  It looked measly when it arrived, dwarfed by the gigantic potato.  But the filet was nothing but tasty, perfectly grilled beefiness.  The potato was a bit dry inside.  I ordered my usual California Sushi Salad.  Huh?  What.....did they get the order mixed up?  This was not my usual CA Sushi Salad.  Beware, the salad is different here than in CA.  Completely different sushi.  Although it looked stunning, I really missed the CA style entree that is served in LA.  Oh well, when in Scottsdale......  Great live music and the usual wonderful Houston's atmosphere.  I hope to be back soon!",

Now for a chain its much nicer than some but still a chain. Their house rule of trying to be something theyre not is pretty stupid.   Though kudos to the manager for not kicking us out as there of course was a confrontation. I love confrontations.. she had no reasonable explanation for the rule except that it was their rule.

They have one of the top 5 cheeseburgers in the Valley. The grilled artichokes are a great starter. The ribs are reliably tasty and tender. They have great specials. And my wife loves the prime rib sandwich.   But here's the problem.... First of all, I loved their fresh fish sandwich - which used to be a rotating selection, grilled to perfection. Now they just have a standard fried fish sandwich - no variety - and that stinks.   And this used to be a family-friendly restaurant, where we'd go with the kids and Grandpa and Grandma for an early dinner (5PM-ish) on Saturday's or Sunday's. They had a great grilled cheese and offered a free dish of ice cream afterwards. But not anymore. In fact, the last time we went - it was our 5YO daughter who requested Houston's only to find out they weren't offering her favorite grilled cheese when we tried to order. She was bummed!  We've found ourselves going to other places instead. Chelsea Grill. Arcadia Tavern. Indulge Burger. Etc.",

It's not cheap to eat there and you expect the food to be consistent but it always isn't. My wife loves the fall vegetable plate but the last two times it was not good the fish that I ordered was very overcooked. I sent it back and the wait staff rolled her eyes.   One other time (years ago) I was waiting with my wife and another couple and we waiting for 30 mins which was normal and person came in with his friends and handed the front person 100.00 it looked like and they were seated right away. I asked the wait girl how much she made a week and she looked shocked that I caught her. She said excuse me walked away I didn't see her for the rest of the night another person seated us 10 mins after that. I wrote a letter to the corp office and never got a letter back.

I have seen the menu change (no more cheese bread...unless you ask), I have seen the prices go up, and now I have seen the addition of sushi.  Who would have thought...Houston's and sushi.  Kind of a weird combo.  But I will tell you it works.  I have tried two of the rolls and both were fantastic.  Mango Tuna and Spicy Tuna.  Definitly give it a shot as an appetizer or for your next meal.  Very filling as the rolls are fairly large.    Service is always great (Rainy is my favorite bartender in town).  Atmosphere is very nice, people very friendly as I usually sit at the bar.  Houston's is a no brainer when you cant decide where to eat.  Never a bad meal.",

I have been to Houston's in Scottsdale many times over the 20 years that I've lived in Phoenix and I have never had a bad meal.  The wait staff is always professional and courteous.  The Baked Potato Soup is to die for.  Their Spinach Dip is also a crowd pleaser.  My favorite is the Ahi Tuna Steak.",

Per tradition, my mom took me to Houston's the first night I was in town. i've been coming here with my family for 10 years now and it's still as good as it was then. We were greeted and seated immediately. We started with a couple cocktails: martini for me, Manhattan for my mom. Our server was very nice and respectful of our request to catch up over our drinks.  For old time sake, I had to go for the Chicago-Style Spinach Dip. I do wish they had a better selection of starter. It's between the dip and some smoked salmon thing. Talk about limited ... For our entrees, we went for salads: Ahi Tuna for me and Thai Noodle for my mom. Both came out perfectly prepared and timed. We also switched to wine with our entree salads. The wine list is nice, high quality selections. Something for everyone.  I'm not the biggest chain restaurant fan, but Houston's does it right. The food is the same every time - great, fresh.",

The tuna part was ok but the lettuce had much too much dressing to eat. The mango pieces were a nice touch. We also ordered the Spinich Dip Yelpers recommended but it was nothing special.",

    "text": "Houston's and I have been friends for about 15 years and our friendship was very strong for about the first ten. In the last 5 years or so Houston's has really put our friendship to the test. Obviously through the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing. Recently they halved the size over the caesar salad and almost doubled the price to 8 dollars. I know to a lot of the customer base this may not be a problem, but it still doesn't make it ok. Another recent issue is the change in potato type for their fries, they're just not as crispy as they used to be. But worst of all is the Houston's/Hillstone split. When Houston's moved from the Esplanade to a bigger space across the street they rebranded with the company's Hillstone name. At first it was all still the same (except they moved the sushi over from Scottsdale) but now corn on the caesar salad? I guess I'll have to stick to Scottsdale.  I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. I will continue to eat at Houston's, that veggie burger can't be beat, but over the years we have started slipping further apart.",

    "text": "Houston's delivers a solid meal every time and that spinach dip goes straight to my hips every time as well!   Yes, there will most likely always be a wait at Houston's unless you get in right before the lunch or dinner crowd...but mind you, there are some early birds in the bunch. Regardless, the wait is ok because they keep a fire going to cozy up the wait time and then there's always the bar to warm you up from the inside out.   The seats at Houston's are nice because they are private so you can have a conversation without feeling like four other tables have stopped their conversation to listen in on yours. The service is normally pretty quick and then there's the food. Like I said, Houston's delvers a solid and hearty meal. The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard. Their honey mustard is creamy and delicious and one of my favorite honey mustard locations. I do miss the Racket club. They used to do it perfectly with some relish and honey mustard on soft bread. RIP Racket Club. However, the normal club is good too and you can never go wrong with the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and their ribs are famous too. For dessert, my personal favorite is the Apple cobbler but apparently it's seasonal and so they will switch it out for the Key Lime Pie. It's always a hit or miss on whether or not they will have the Apple Cobbler and personally, I think they need to keep the cobbler on the menu year-round because it would keep some regular customers coming in over and over -- like me!   I've been visiting Houston's for years. It's also cozy once inside and the fire",

The sushi combo plate is fantastic. Best sushi I have ever had in my life. Really. That's just the appetizer. THEN I order the grilled seasonal fish and veggies, always good. Ask them to go light on the butter and oil. And get a side of string fries. They are amazing! Also great is the Grilled Chicken Salad...put the fries IN the salad. You will LOVE it! The chicken is like butter. And my hubby always gets the cheese toast although it is not on the menu and the filet (always perfect) and baked beans.  My only complain is they don't have a happy hour. They are too good for that I guess. That's a bummer. Service here is like none other though. The best!",

Price point for the quality is on target. Admittedly, my wife and I thought the trimmed down menu was too basic and too small but otherwise it was a nice evening.

My wife had eaten here previously and wanted to have dinner there.  She called for a reervation and was told that the seating was primarily booth seating and could be 'tight' for a party of 8.  Hostess was named Emily.  She suggested 2 booths, we declined.  She then said there was one large table but she could not reserve as it was first come, first served.  Since we were planning to be there at 5 PM, we assumed we could probably get the table due to the early hour.  When we arrived, it took 15 minutes for them to show us to our table.  It was a regular booth, judged too small by all of us.  Manager then got involved and showed us to a both that was \"3 inches bigger\".  No more than 3 inches, that's for sure.  We declined as asked about the table.  Manager said, and it was evident from looking, that there was no table.  When I said that \"Emily\" told us about a table the day before on the phone, she denied it.  Emily apparently has trouble with the truth.  We declined to eat at the restaurant and found another venue across the street.  After all, Scottsdale has lots of good restaurants.  I see that the other Houston's in Phoenix is now closed.  I don't doubt that the Scottsdale location will still follow due to their lack of customer service and inability to seat more than 4 people for dinner.    Will never return. We found J. Alexander's right across the street.  Had everything a good restaurant should-large tables, excellent service, businesslike attitude and good food.",

Houston's is expensive, but the food and service (at the bar) is very good.  It seems like the prices keep going up and salad portions keep getting smaller.  I don't eat there as often as I would like because it can get very expensive on a regular basis.  The food is great, don't get me wrong, but a grilled chicken salad should not be $17 and a French dip should not be priced at $22.  They have no happy hour drink prices and that kind of sucks.  A glass of Pinot Grigio is $11.  Normally, $$$$$ isn't an issue for me when it's quality, but that's a little much.  I know they don't want to promote a bar atmosphere and have gotten so popular (just a tad arrogant) they don't need any happy hour, but it's nice when friends are meeting so it's not so expensive for the group.  I will keep going because it's a special treat, but not as often as I would like.",

I don't see it on their website anymore, but my coworkers and I would treat ourselves once a month and go to Houston's and enjoy the gracious service, delicious food, and I believe that one had a lovely deck overlooking a pond.    When our anniversary rolled around this year, Houston's came to mind as a place to revisit.  It's still the same classy, comfortable interior and the service is perfect.  Our main server, Russell, was attentive and friendly, and the woman who brought out our appetizer had a quick wit because as she came around the corner I was holding a cocktail in each hand and said, \"I'm having both drinks tonight\" and she said, \"Well you have to taste test them, right?\"  Absolutely!  Speaking of those cocktails, mine was the elder collins ($13) and it went down way too quickly.  That's a nice summertime drink for sure.  My husband had the Manhattan ($12) which both of us enjoyed (I just had a sip, I swear) and you can tell we don't get out to classier restaurants much because I was so impressed that halfway through the drink, Russell stopped by to pour it into a freshly chilled glass.  That was a nice touch.    We then shared the Hawaiian ribeye ($36) which is worth every penny.  Full of flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare, it was fantastic.  We chose fries for the side and those were delicious as well.  We didn't make a reservation, but got there with the geriatric crew and golfers for an early dinner at 4:30 on a Saturday.  We had no problem getting a table then, but by the time we were finished the place was full and people were waiting.  I'm glad to see they are still a wonderful place to go out for dinner.  We need to return more often.  Thank you, Houston's, for a very nice anniversary dinner.",

    "text": "Definitely not a five star caliber restaurant (think Dominick's or Capital Grille). But they pretend to be and even have a batch of dress code cards at the hostess stand, because they probably attract a trashy element. There's literally nothing 5 star about this place. 3.5, maybe. On par with Cheesecake Factory or PF Changs for ambience, if that. Actual 5 star restaurants don't make you wait when you have a reservation and they have tablecloths.   I took a family member for their birthday, because they wanted the flying chicken. I made a reservation and told the manager that it was a birthday.   When we got there, even though we had a reservation and the place was only 3/4 full, on July 16, we were made to wait 15 minutes. High end, reputable restaurants do not engage in that type of bait and switch service.   The waitress comes over at the end of the meal and said that she has something special for the birthday boy, either a chocolate sundae or whatever else. He chose the sundae.  Never in the history of histories has an allegedly high end restaurant charged for a birthday dessert that they offered to bring to the table. The sundae was on the bill for $8 and some change.   Dominick's brings out a complimentary homemade beignet tree for all of their VIP birthday guests. It's not even on the menu. Or butter cake for non VIP guests. Again, no reputable, high end restaurant charges for birthday desserts.   Will never go back to this trashy place.  PS. what's also telling about how dreadful this establishment is is that they don't respond to bad reviews. 5 star restaurants do, because they want you to return. This place is probably the worst and most poorly run restaurant in the valley of its ilk.",

I asked her to check with the chef.  \"NO, we fry it in butter\".  She had no suggestion of what would be safe for me.  I finally ordered the hamburger cooked Medium which came out with a buttered bun and was clearly Rare.  I didn't say anything, as Karely was obviously annoyed already.

I can honestly say that I could eat here 7 days a week....and come in just as excited as the first time every time I step foot in the door. I have dreams about the French dip it's so amazing, and the Ribs are a close second.  I have been to this location at least 30 times, and Houston's and Hillstone's all over the USA. The service and food are always consistent and top notch.  I've never had a bad meal here, so you really can't go wrong. I could go on and on, but here are some all time favorites:  Spinach and artichoke dip BEST French Dip EVER - prime rib shaved to perfection with a jus  Cheeseburger - grass fed, ground in house, get it medium rare. One of the best in town. Chicken sandwich - Chik Fil A style but way more incredible Fish sandwich - the quality of the fish will catch you by surprise. It's sneaky good! RIBS - you won't find better ribs anywhere. They put Don & Charlie's to shame.   The Kale Salad is great as are the fries, baked potato and seasonal vegetable.   Ok, I'm ready to go to Houston's now!!",

I recommend the flying chicken because it's super crispy yet light and the French dip is really juicy, great quality meat.  My boyfriend got the Hawaiian ribeye and was in heaven.

I think I saw about 10 other tables being used, all scattered around the restaurant.   The service was good. Food delivery time was 12 minutes from order to table. Everything was as ordered. I had the french dip and fries.  Long before I ever heard of this chain I decided I didn't like those ultra thin fries, that are served here. When the menu described \"hand cut\" fries I was expecting what is commonly called \"steak fries.\" They were tasty but I don't like ultra skinny fries.  The french dip was serves with juice on the side. The beef was tasty and tender, much better than all the others I've had in the valley, except maybe for a different concept of the same sandwich is the Beef on Weck at Joe's Diner is more tender and tasty.   Coffee after was also tasty. Our waiter did a top notch job of keeping our glasses filled  but not being to intrusive.  I will return to this location.",

    "text": "I've eaten at various Houston's branches many times over the last 20 years, in many cities, and the best thing I can say about it is that it is very predictable.  It's a chain restaurant that lies in between the 1st tier chains (e.g., Arnie Morton's) and the 3rd tier chains (Chili's).  Food - Fine, if somewhat boring Decor - Corporate posh; comfortable but bland Service - Excellent, well trained staff Value - Not so good.  Dinner will set you back $100, easily, without wine.  Wine in particular is extremely over-priced here.  Back in the day, they were a much better value.  At $25 to $30 for nearly every entree, it's not such a great deal.  There is almost always a better choice nearby from my experience.  In short, a great place to take someone unadventurous who is more comfortable at a chain restaurant than an owner-operated place, which is why it's so popular for corporate type lunches and travelers I guess.  It's fine for corporate events, but when I'm spending my own money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Arnie Morton's, which are only slightly more expensive but much nicer.",

She didn't even notice I only took about 5 bites of the salad, after pushing all the tortilla strips to the side.  I'm seriously trying to lose weight, and only ate a few bites of the salad.

The service is always OUTSTANDING first of all. All the staff is friendly and has great customer service. When we were there I wanted the Fish Sandwich. The server ordered that but then later came back  and said they ran out. I was very disappointed it was Friday and still early. I ordered my 2nd choice but didn't like it. We told the server what happened and without question the manager Angela came over to our table and apologized. She let me order something different and took other dinner off the menu. We were very satisfied  with the service! We came back again  and the manager Angela remembered us. We didn't order the Fish sandwich! But when we got our food  the manager brought it out as a SURPRISE with our dinner! This was INCREDIBLE not only did she take care of us the first time, but she made it even better if the 2nd time!

Houston's is delicious...It's in the Hillstone family, so it's like Bandera with a larger menu and less of a southwestern flair. Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.  Last night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.  I've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.    4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation.   If you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "This is the Scottsdale Houston's -- the top notch of the bunch -- and it easily surpasses the already impressive service and presentation of the Esplanade Houston's hands down.  Unfortunately, you know the action/reaction thing? It applies in this case, as well, and while the Esplanade Houston's will sit you on a twenty minute wait, get comfortable with a forty minute plus wait on peak hours around here.   Sure, the regulars get preferential treatment, as it should be, I suppose. I mean, if I am shelling some extraordinary percentage of my paychecks to one particular establishment, I would want it, too. But, for the lot of you that aren't regulars, that spells trouble.   Once you get a seat, you are in for a wonderful, albeit pricey, meal. If your in a rush, my advice is to call ahead or go at an off hour.",

    "text": "So far I have been to this specific Houston's twice and both times I had a great experience as well as a great meal.  The first time I went with a friend of mine.  I had their roasted chicken with couscous and we split the hot fudge sundae.  One of the most flavorful roasted chicken and couscous I have ever had.  And the fudge was rich and decadent.  I had it again the second time I went (yesterday) with my husband.  However, I was a little disappointed with the texture of the ice cream the second time.  It was a little bit on the icy side.  It was still really good though.    My husband and I also had their Rainbow Roll and their Thai Tuna Roll (sushi).  Also some of the best tasting sushi I have had in the valley, but again I experienced a little bit of a disappointment.  The first roll that came out was the Rainbow Roll, and although it tasted great it was a bit too cold.  Yet, they made up for it with the Thai Tuna Roll -- the perfect temperature.  I also had the Hawaiian Rib Eye (medium rare), my husband had the Prime Rib (medium), and we both had their Cesar Salad.   All of it was very tasty.  The salad was crisp and fresh, with just the right amount of dressing -- thoroughly coating every leaf and not drowning them.  My rib eye was brown and carmalized on the outside and the center was warm and rare without being bloody -- just how a good steak should be. It was marinated in a light terriyaki marinade which gave it great flavor, perhaps a little sweet for my taste buds, but still very good.  I'm more of a savory person.  I can't say anything about the prime rib (I was too busy with my rib eye), but my husband thought his prime rib was very tender, not too fatty, and he thought the horse radish was balanced well so as not to overpower the flavor of the beef.  Our enterees also came with baked potatoes, which were good.  We did not get another side, but I think next time we go I will get a side of their vegetables to cut the richness of everything. We ended with the hot fudge sundae, but next time it will be the peach cobbler.   The staff was also very great.  They were attentive without being overbearing and their smiles felt genuine. The atmosphere is cozy due to the smaller size, lively, and comfortable.  No pretensions anywhere. All in all, a great dinner.  We spent a worthwhile $175 including a bottle of merlot ($36) and 20% tip.  We left stuffed, happy, and a bit buzzed.  LOL.",

Almost full restaurant but we managed to get  seats in the bar.  Our server was good. He was pretty attentive  about keeping up with refills.  Nice touch with the frozen glasses for sodas.  Seemed knowledgable as well.  I ordered the California seabass.  Was a little like halibut.  Seemed a bit dry as did my friend's swordfish.  Both needed a lot of sauce to make up for the dryness.  The spaghetti squash side was undercooked but still ok.  No one really enjoyed the little tomatos doused in olive oil they serve with the fish.  Everything seemed just drowned in oil or butter.    Nice selections on the menu though.  I would definetly give it another shot.  Hopefully the guest services girls at the front lighten up a little bit though next time.",

After we waited at the bar area for 20 minutes (with no one offering us a drink or appetizer, etc...) we were finally seated. After a long wait at our seat, we finally got a drink order in, then someone else took our order, then someone else brought it out.  My friend ordered her burger medium-well and it came out bloody.  I ordered the Thai Jungle noodle salad with steak (medium).  Mine came out very rare, and the pieces of meat appeared to have been sitting somewhere for a long time between being half-cooked and served to me. We've all BBQ'd and we know what OLD meat looks and tastes like...very disgusting.  Not to mention the fact that my portion size was about half of what it normally is.  Needless to say, we finally found a server who apparently was our server, she apologized that we had three other people wait on us.   We sent back the burger, it took over 25 minutes to get another one, by this time were weren't hungry anymore, and the manager brought out the 'new' burger...we complained about the service and the meals, and after a few minutes of back and forth, he agreed to comp our meals.  Meanwhile our server came back to us to box up the new burger and apologized for the bad service...she was definitely mad and was letting us know. I told her not to worry about it, it probably wasn't her fault...she then got IN MY FACE and asked me \"What do you mean by that!! What do you mean it's not my fault!!\" After totally freaking out on us and scaring us half to death, we paid the check and left her a nice tip and got OUT of there.  I used to love this place but will never go back!",

    "text": "I had heard a lot of great things about this place and the Hillstone group in general ever since I moved here so I finally went to Houston's and was disapointed.  The menu was a bore and a snore and lacking options which is fine if the few things you have on the menu are truly amazing.  I ordered the filet mignon by default because there wasn't anything else that grabbed my attention.  Also everyone said the steaks were amazing.  When the food got there I was excited.  The steak looked beautiful and when I cut into it, it looked like a perfect medium rare.  I was impressed until I took a bite.  Yikes.  I don't know if it was just the particular piece of meat I had or what but the taste was weird and bad.  It had the taste that steak gets when you try and re-heat it in the microwave.  I tried several bites hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Luckily the monster baked potatoe was great.  I am not sure if my steak was undercooked then they tried to quickly compensate and nuke it real quick.  I have serious doubts that any established steakhouse would do that but.... something was off about my steak.  The boyfriend got the ribs whom the server swore were the best in town. Lies.  Ribs were not fall off the bone tender and not very meaty.  On the positives portions were huge so you get a good value for the price... that is if you like what you're eating.  I probably will not return even though I feel I should give the steak another try.  Hillstone group so far is just mehhh",

I had the Hawain Rib-Eye and they did a good job of cooking to my exact specifications,  no too mention that the seasoning they used made the steak all that much more tastier.  Their coleslaw stands out more than your average coleslaw because it doesn't rely on a strong bitter taste that most coleslaws have because of the vinegar.  The glass of merlot I had with the meal was not too strong, not too weak, and had just the right amount of fruitiness to make it a perfect compliment to my steak dinner.  What was also a delight was the desert,  the hot fudge sunday is great since they serve the hot fudge on the side so you can distribute it in whatever amount you desire at anytime that you are eating the ice cream.  The atmoshere isn't too flashy, the service is punctual and friendly,  and to top it all off, they do the right thing of having the kitchen be right in plain view for everyone to see.  Not every restaurant does that but every restaurant should.",

It's usually a huge portion and is nicely marbled and seasoned just right.  Paired with the au jus and horseradish, it's my favorite prime rib in the valley.  yummy!  My husband's must-gets are the smoked salmon and the chicken caesar salad.  They are BOTH delicious.  The smokiness of the salmon, the crisp toast, and the tarter sauce make it one of the best appetizer dishes around.  Lastly, about the caesar salad:  it's got the perfect dressing.  It's creamy, cheesy, and has a really nice garlicy kick to it.    The servers & hosts are great in this location.  It seems they're always very gracious and are smiling.

The veggie burger I got - recommended by our server - was flavorless and fell apart in my hands.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  Didn't spend enough money?  My wife had some sort of grilled fish sandwich and she enjoyed it.  raved about the delicious fish and the sample she shared - grudgingly - was well cooked and seasoned.   Decent ambience, the decor is comforting, rich and fairly dark.  The lighting level is just about perfect.  A lot of places can't seem to nail that.  Crowded with happy diners, so maybe I am the outlier without the smile on the face.  We were seated fairly soon and I thought the hostesses did a good job keeping up with us as we moved around the bar before finding a place to light briefly with our adult beverages.  But, $90, for what?!",

My aunt doesn't know slot about wines so she had to taste a few before we found the right match. :-) I ordered the the club salad with buttermilk garlic dressing on the side.  The chicken was on the bottom of the salad. Different presentation, but I liked it. This was my first time dining here. I will definitely go back!",

My boyfriend and I wanted a good steak so we decided to come here one Friday night. We had to wait for a little bit but that didn't bother me and it was worth it. First we got the spinach dip which was delicious. He got the prime rib and I got the filet and I'm pretty sure that was the first time I ate a steak and actually loved it. Sooooo good. I think it came with mashed potatoes and some vegetables on the side. I tried his too and it was good but I thought the filet was better. It wasn't a super cheap meal that's for sure but we knew that going into it. Our server was really friendly as well. We'll be going back!",

After bringing a party of 5 to the restaurant to dine for my girlfriends birthday we were notified by the staff that were could not eat there due to one of the girls tank tops being above belly level. After offering the solution to switch shirts with another girl in the party we were told that the \"damage had been done\" because people in the restaurant had already seen what she was wearing... are you kidding me?? They offered her an extra large black shirt for her to  wear as the only option to stay for a girl that stands 5'2\" and would make a mockery of her as it had a name tag on it and stuck out like a soar thumb. Mind you this is AFTER we put an order in. Needless to say, we immediately cancelled the order and proceeded to leave. Words can't explain how poorly that situation was handled by the management and staff for a restaurant that has such high reviews.  Very disappointed.",

We all couldn't resist the temptation of the cheeseburger. Mine was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the portion was huge. The fries were kind of like shoe string ones and very thin, which is why I knocked a star off the top. I prefer big steak fries.  The beer list was pretty impressive too. I had a Pacifico and a Heineken Light while we were there.  One warning, the prices can be a little steep. A cheeseburger is $14 and it was the cheapest thing on the menu. The servers were very attentive and I had a great time.",

    "text": "So I will say the service was impeccable. We came for lunch and it was surprisingly not busy. We had a baby with us and instead of using high chairs, they have one that connects to the table. I like that so much more because then the baby isn't sticking out in the aisle and they can feel included in the meal as well and right by mom/dad/whomever. They offer a very large bar with some craft cocktails. Only 2 of us were drinking and only one get a cocktail. It was a moscow mule. The drink itself was good, nothing over the top and it didn't come in a copper cup. They do have a good wine selection, somewhat limited in by the glass options but I made due and got a really nice Sav Blanc from New Zealand. I will say the pour is a little heavy and I love it! As for the food, 2 people split the Hawaiian ribeye as per the recommendation of our server. The portion was large for one person so it was perfect for 2. They asked for medium and it came medium with some parts a little medium rare so they were very happy. The char on it was perfect. My husband got the famous french dip. It was enormous. I think it was about 6 inches thick and mostly meat. It also looked like it was freshly sliced meat because it didn't have that dark brown crusted edge to it but was pink and clean cut. It was excellent. The portion was also huge, he struggled to finish it. Finally, I got the Thai steak salad and wow! I can't wait to go back and get it again. The amount of dressing was just right, it had a great spice to it but not enough that I wanted to grab water every few seconds. The portion was very large but I had no problem finishing it and basically licking the plate after. I would highly recommend this one. We finished the meal with their famous ice cream sundae. Before you laugh, it was more than enough for 4 of us to share and they give you a gravy boat of hot fudge on the side. Did you hear me- a GRAVY boat full of fudge. Yes, we used our spoons and finished the fudge that way. Definitely worth the calories.",

    "text": "Today I decided to treat my sister and her fiance to dinner tonight for treating me so well since I moved to Arizona from Hawaii. I asked my sister to make reservations at her favorite restaurant and she decided on Houston's. She was raving about their Hawaiian Rib-eye that she always orders from them. She was excited to take me here bc she loves food just as much as I do (especially a good filet steak). We arrived five minutes early for our reservation and the hostess asked if we were a party of three and my sister replied yes. The hostess then responded that it will be about a 15 minute wait. My sister then told her we had a reservation here, after I said \"Wait, don't we have a reservation?\". My sister assumed that they recognized her bc she comes here that often. We got seated right away and the night started off right. The ambiance is really nice and we got asked for beverages pretty quickly. We ordered as soon as we got our beverages bc we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the Home Smoked Salmon, Hawaiian Ribeye (for my sister and her fiance to share bc they are on a 'diet'), side of Seasonal Veggies, USDA Prime Center-Cut Filet, and 2 beers. I ordered my filet to be Medium RARE. The smoked salmon came out first and It was OK but my sister loved it. Next our entrees came out... the top of my steak was pretty BLACK. When I cut in to the steak I already knew it was bad. It cut like how you think a thick beef jerky might cut. But I thought maybe the taste will make up for it... I was wrong! The steak tasted like beef charcoal. I then asked my sister and the fiance to try it, thinking maybe I was going crazy. But they agreed that the steak was charred. My sister insisted that I tell our waitress, but I didn't have the heart to. Next thing I knew she flagged our waitress down and told her the situation. She agreed that the steak was over cooked but also mentioned that all their steaks were normally charred. I do not believe that anybody would eat a steak that taste like that! She apologized and said she will bring a new one right out. She took my plate away plus my utensils and I had to sit there watching them eat their food. I didn't have utensils to even take a bite of what they had. My sister offered a bite so I took one off her fork. But they were sharing a plate so I didn't want to eat the little they had. My plate FINALLY came after they already finished their plate. The manager (I assumed he was bc he was wearing a suit) put the plate down and apologized again and asked me to cut through the steak to make sure it was to my liking. He was awkwardly hovering so I felt rushed to roll-out my new utensils out of my napkin and felt rushed to cut through it. I have to say the steak was prepared much better. So I sat there eating my plate ALONE for the next 15 minutes. It was a really undesirable experience. Instead of having normal family conversations, it became more about the restaurant and the steak. We all agreed that for a higher-end restaurant such as Houston's we would expect something to be on the house. But we got our bill and everything was there. Nothing was comped, not even the side seasonal veggies. They did nothing to make up for it. I told my sister that I was disappointed on her choice of restaurant and now she is a little upset even though I was the one who got the short end of the stick. I still gave her a 15% tip bc it wasn't her fault for my piece of charcoal. My sister is going to have to rethink her favorite restaurant.",

However, I was not treated to the wonderful dining experience that I remember Houston's having.  On this afternoon I ordered light. I started off with the baked potato soup, and I ordered the $15 Veggie plate.  Here's what's on the veggie plate -  a small serving of braised red cabbage with goat cheese, 3 half cherry tomatoes, 3 broc stalks, 6-7 tri-colored uncooked carrots, bread, and maybe 7 peas.  You've got to be kidding me.  The veggie's were barely cooked, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and a little olive oil. I was severely disappointed.  I remember the food being better, and next time will not make the mistake of getting the WAY overpriced veggie plate, and will stick to the usual ribs. Lesson learned.",

Where do I even start? One of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. The center cut filet that I had could practically be cut with just my fork.   Major kudos go to Houston's for the level of their food in comparison to their price. They are definitely a high end steak house so be prepared to spend a little extra but unlike most high end steak houses everything isn't ala cart. I don't mind paying $43 for an amazing steak especially when it comes with equally amazing mash potatoes and broccoli.   Overall, we got an appetizer, prime rib, center cut filet with sides on both and some alcoholic drinks and our bill was a little over $100. I'll take that all day every day. Great experience. Great food and great price for the high quality of food we received. I'll definitely be back in the future.",

It was my husbands birthday & I made a point of telling the waiter at the beginning of the meal...   We ordered a dessert for each of us & they brought it out.

So the next night we went to Cafe Monarch & they DO make a big deal out of celebrating birthdays, plus their food was beyond fabulous!  So from now on when I am in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area... I will order my pie from the Pie Snob &  I will by-pass Houston's & go to my new favorite... Cafe Monarch.   I do like to Celebrate Birthdays:)",

The New Style Seared Tuna Salad was really good, but if your really looking for something to just make your mouth water order the Barbecue Pork Ribs they are to die for. Fall of the bone tender a little tangy, a great bark. There was nothing wrong with those ribs. Homade Sweet & Sour made their margarita's delicious and the perfect pair to cool down their Firehouse Chili. Reservations Highly recommended at least 4 hrs early",

I especially love their artichoke appetizer (when you can get it). 5/5. The other dishes that are always a homerun include the salmon with mashed potatoes (5/5) and the Asian chicken salad (5/5). The thing that sets Houston's apart from other restaurants is the fact that their food is always consistent. It's great every single time you have it, and it does not change in flavor or consistency. The atmosphere is always nice, but casual. Also, the bar is phenomenal. I will always have a special place in my stomach for Houston's!",

    "text": "Decided to check our Houston's recently on my family vacay to Scottsdale and overall it was a pretty decent experience.  We stopped by for lunch and the place was totally dead. We were seated immediately but our server seemed pretty indifferent to our presence. We didn't see our server after he dropped off our food and had waive down a busser for refills and the check. Maybe it was because we were younger than the average patron, but service was a bit of a let down. The restaurant is nice and spacious, and definitely fits the upscale atmosphere of Scottsdale.   My cousins ordered the Hickory Burger which came with a mound of shredded cheddar cheese and thick slices of Canadian bacon. While it sounds good, the cheese was too much and the bacon slices added a rubbery texture to the burger.  I had the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich which was pretty decent. I could see why the kitchen skewered it twice with toothpicks as the sandwich falls apart pretty quick. Despite it's structural problems, the sandwich was delicious and probably one of the better offerings on the lunch menu. I was disappointed that the soft drinks were 'by the bottle' and not refillable. At $3 for a  8oz bottle, you could easily spend the price of your entree on soda.   Overall I wouldn't mind returning for dinner but Houstons wouldn't be at the top my list for dining",

We were late for our reservation (we called before our reservation time and let them know we were running late). Instead of smiling and politely saying \"we'll get you seated here shortly\" when we arrived, she said in a less than friendly tone without a smile \"Well you're 20 minutes late for your reservation and we've seated other people so you're going to have to wait until we clear another table\".   Once seated everyone that attended us was friendly - however when my food came my fries were cold. I was halfway done with my ribs before our server checked on us and I could send them back. By the time the new fries came which were great, my meal was mostly done. The ribs were very good, but didn't have as much BBQ as I would have liked and while tender, not as tender as I've had at other hillstones.   The other Hillstones/Houston's/Rutherford's that I've been to have been phenomenal experiences. This one left quite a bit to be desired. Overall disappointed with the customer experience but giving 3 stars because the food is (usually) awesome here.",

If I wanted to overpay for a small portion, I'd have gone to a Fox Restaurant. This is the unfortunate trend is that restaurants are not giving customers enough-it's just salad, people.  Seriously, it would have cost them $0.30 if that to have made the dish acceptable but yet this seems to happen more and more. Also, there's cilantro in the salad but no mention of that and I'm allergic.The pork chop was fantastic, though and the server was pleasant.  Just tired of getting ripped off for $15-$18 salads with an oversized plate and barely anything on it.  You don't complain when you're there bc you may be with people, but you go away disappointed and it's 6mo or more till you try it again.",

Service was great, friendly attentive servers but as for the overall experience and food, I'd say it was just eh & overpriced for the little flavor to be found. Nothing to brag about.   Probably won't return as I fee this place is more for the ambiance rather than to get a good flavorful meal. It gets pretty packed, even on a Tuesday so reservations are recommended.",

We decided to go again for a celebration, since it had been our go-to place in the past for such events & was always spot on.  First, the positives -  we had a dinner reservation and were seated right away. The hostess and our server were very attentive and friendly. Our food came out fairly quickly, which was a nice surprise considering it was a full house.   Now the negatives - the food was average at best, and it is surprisingly much more expensive these days. Our bill was $48 before tip, and our meal was 1 cheeseburger & fries ($16), 1 french dip & fries ($22) and 2 iced teas ($7). My husband had a very difficult time handling the burger being cut into quarters - looks nice as far as presentation, but just falls apart once it's picked up to eat. The second negative was how dark it was in the restaurant. I understand the need for \"mood\" lighting, but when even 20 & 30 yr old customers are having to use their flashlight apps to read the menu, come on - turn up the lights a little please! (Let alone how dangerous it makes the steps inside the venue!)  Overall, it was a decent experience, but we probably won't go back. There are much better restaurants (for those types of menu items that we ordered) in Scottsdale, for a lot less money.",

My mom and her boyfriend are HUGE fans of Houston's, especially their martinis and the Hawaiian steak. So when it came time to select a location for my brother to surprise our mom for Mother's Day (he flew in from across the country), it was Houston's, selected by her boyfriend.   So once I picked up my brother from Sky Harbor and we stepped inside, the sweet hostesses knew who we were and guided us to the table. Unfortunately it was dark outside and Houston's is dimly lit, so the effect wasn't all there. But.... she was absolutely floored and speechless, and the meal started off to a great weekend. Of course I got one of the martinis and was blown away by how great it was. The staff were kind to refill our spin dip because my brother and I were starving once we arrived. The three of them ordered the Hawaiian steak (and luckily for me I got their leftovers). My salmon was buttery and cooked to perfection, along with the sides that came with.   I can't be more thankful for the amazing dining experience we had at Houston's, and I look forward to returning again in the near future.",

    "text": "Houston's is a classic. Lovely service and fine food. The menu is pretty traditional for American food and the quality is top notch. I've been coming to Houston's for years with my family -- it's a great group restaurant and for more intimate nights as well. Last night I wasn't super impressed with the drinks we ordered -- my old fashioned was weak and overly sweetened. Our meal, however, was fantastic. The ribs are to die for and they have one of the best burgers around. Flavors were perfect but my burger was split into four wedges which made it pretty hard to eat and it fell apart causing me to need to use my fork. I'm not a big fan of this change and wish they would stick with traditional. When in season, the artichoke app should never be passed up and the five-nut brownie with ice cream is the best way to end the night!!",

I ordered their $16 cheeseburger and it was served to me pre-cut Into quarter pieces. Yes..they took my hamburger and sliced it for me into toddler sized 1/4 pieces. I can confidentially say that in my 30 years of ordering hamburgers all over the globe that it has never not come in a circular form. DON'T cut people's food. Especially a burger..odd odd odd   Still love Houston's.",

However, we saw people there in shorts, t-shirts, ball caps and dressy clothes.  Hm.  I would think a place this nice all people would dress a little nicer - oh well.  The menu is limited, but does have a little of everything.  We ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, loaded baked potato, prime rib, filet, baked beans and the veggie plate.  Everything was wonderful.  The veggie plate is not your usual veggie plate - very unique items and a barley salad that is out of this world.  The prices aren't bad either.  We will definately be back!",

There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal. The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so, for me, I settled for a mushroom burger. We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was \"helping\" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water. We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking. I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly, functioned restaurant.",

Weird, I know, for an upscale American restaurant, but its really delicious.  Its not traditional sushi of course, but wonderful none the less.  Their veggie burger is one of my favorites anywhere, the seasonal veggie plate is awesome, and the thai steak and noodle salad is perfect.  Their coleslaw is the best I've ever had and the rice and beans side is surprisingly satisfying.  If they have Key Lime Pie, GET IT!!!!  You must save room or you are missing out!  The next thing I'm going to try is an order of ribs with a bun and coleslaw.  My brother says its the best sandwich you'll ever have.  Wow...i'm salivating.....Time for dinner!",

Well, if you can and you're interested in these kind of words, go to Houston's for only the BEST ever, hands down, without a doubt, yummiest french dip sandwich you've ever had in your life (be forewarned, they put mayo on the bread, so if you're not into mayo on your french dip, like me, then ask for no mayo),but Ooooooooooooooo... YUM!! And if you like killer chili (they only serve chili on Saturday's), you won't be sorry you ordered theirs -- it's amazing. Or how about a kick-butt burger, eh? Simply delish! And don't even get me started on their artichoke dip -- there isn't enough word space on Yelp for me to go there! Trust.   This is by far one of my favorite restaurants, unfortunately I live in Portland (where they've never even heard of a Houston's -- poor people!) and I only get to visit the Scottsdale location every once in awhile when I hide myself away in my husband's suitcase whenever he goes there on business. :(   GREAT french dip! Fabulous fries! Fantabulous chili. Kick-butt burger! S.P.I.N.A.C.H. A.R.T.I.C.H.O.K.E.  D.I.P. Mmmm... in the best possible way!  A few tips:   No baseball caps for men/boys -- unless you're sitting in the bar area, and then it's fine. But if you're a boy, you can't be in the bar area, so take that hat off!  Dress is casual or you can even dress-it-up a bit if you want and not feel out of place in the least bit.   Can get really busy, so if you're in a hurry, get there early!",

Great food and wonderful ambiance! The drinks are poured by bartenders who know a thing or two about, well...pouring drinks.  Its where you'd dine if you were in a detective noire film..Bogart style. Its a timeless and classy joint. Very much a fine dining experience and yes you can dress it up or down and still expect top flight service and a wonderful meal! Love the roast beef sandwich...incredible. Steaks, seafood and specials also delight.   Houston's has a \"vibe\" - its those low lights, mahogany booths and the neon clock. It keeps me coming back. I love dining there and it endures as a favorite upper echelon spot to eat while being able to dispense with some of the \"stuffiness\"that other comparable dining establishments require. A++",

I ordered the pork filet which was a little salty, but still delicious. It's rare to find pork filet and I'm glad I ordered it. I subbed the mashed potatoes for the baked potato and it was great. The braised red cabbage is also delicious. We topped off the night with a hot fudge sundae which was THE BEST HOT FUDGE SUNDAE I've ever had. Get it! Lastly, great margaritas!",

He had one and a half drinks, we were seated at a table for dinner, my husband stepped up to the bar with our friend just to have a conversation away from the table and get another drink and the bartender refused to serve him. And the way she did it was very rude and embarrassing. We had already ordered our dinner and they had just brought our appetizers, but :after talking to the manager who supported the bartender, we got up and left. We are not young punks who drink too much. I don't drink at all and my husband is a very successful business owner here in Scottsdale, AZ, works very hard and on the weekend likes to start his Friday night with one or two cocktails, three at the most. We live year round and frequent Houston's quite often. Here we are at Sumomaya having a fabulous time. We will NEVER EVER go back to Houston's again and will urge our friends do the same. I have rated them poorly on Google also. I have never seen my husband so insulted and angry as tonight. And it started out so well with my husband having a good time talking to a gentleman at the bar and our friends............you're missing out Houston's........we're here year round when all the snowbirds go back to wherever......you need a lesson in diplomacy! I would give you a zero but that's not an option.  It's not like we're some young kids who drink too much. My husband is a very successful business owner and we live in Scottsdale year round. We frequent Houston's quite often because we like the food and the service and my husband likes to have one or two drinks on Friday to wind down from his week. I do not drink at all so I'm our built in DD. No one has ever treated us more disgracefully than that bartender and then the manager either was not trained well enough in customer relations/communications to handle it properly.  I NEVER give bad reviews of restaurants since I grew up in a gourmet restaurant and would never want to affect someone's business adversely. I only post positive reviews, but this was definitely an exception that was called for........",

We had the ribs (always a hit and my favorite) and shared their amazingly simple yet delicious garden salads with a side of broccoli for the little one who loved it.

The problem was with service which is rare I must admit.  We had a reservation and was left standing for 25 minutes. Management did offer a free appetizer to soothe our ruffled feathers so I must admit, it did. (A drink would have soothed better, however)  Our waiter was terrible. We completely finished our appetizer before our drinks arrived, including water...we asked multiple times for refills of water and cocktails but sadly remained dry once more.  My husband was offered \"complimentary\" catsup, but never delivered. I've never heard catsup described as complimentary... In short, I/we had become accustomed to almost perfection from this amazing restaurant and left so disappointed and embarrassed as we treated my brother to dinner after raving about 'one of our favorite restaurants'...he was NOT impressed to say the least.  Please Houston's, do not falter under the pressure of popularity. Your too amazing to follow so many other establishments into mediocrity.  Oh, BTW, try the ribs...their AMAZING!",

I ordered the tempura battered chicken. This is unusual for me as I try to avoid fried food. The batter was extremely light and not greasy. I actually really liked it. The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was not excessively creamy. I really loathe slaw swimming in watery over creamy dressing  The pork chop was extremely well done and super moist. The purpose of the meal was to try the braised cabbage. My significant other hears this was good. He likes it a lot. I found it rather bitter   The let down of the meal, and why it scores only a 3 was the meal temperature. Both meals were not hot. Not even close to hot. There were on the cooler side of warm. The mash potatoes that came with the pork chop was nearly cold and has developed a paste like consistency  We should have sent them back but we were hungry and they were not cold, just a lot less than hot",

My recent visit was no exception.. one person in our group was running late so we ordered without her and as soon as the waitress saw her come in she came over and made sure our food all hit the table at the same time.. don't you hate having to wait to eat because someone hasn't gotten their food yet.  The salads are amazing but I went with the French dip sandwich & fries .. sandwich is served with horseradish & aujus .. yummy thinly sliced prime rib on French bread.. trust me they set that down and you think I'm only going to eat half .. haha nope you eat the whole thing and then dip your fries in that horseradish sauce until it's all gone.   Plenty of parking.. fast service .. great food!",

    "text": "This is my first review of 2019, celebrating my third year being a part of the Yelp! squad.  I reluctantly agreed to go to Houston's thinking it was a run of the mill, chain steakhouse...even though my friend told me it wasn't.   I was really, really wrong about it.  I had the Flying Chicken, Sauteed Red Cabbage, Spaghetti Squash and a small hot fudge sundae. I am a super picky eater and loved everything. I'm not even much of a fan of hot fudge but the fudge sauce was delicious and was served in a gravy boat. What's not to love about that?  The chicken was fried in tempura batter and not greasy in any way. Beautiful presentation! Served with a BBQ sauce and honey mustard sauce. The red cabbage was sauteed with balsamic vinegar and brown sugar, not too sweet. The balsamic made a nice sauce-like coating. I generally don't like any kind of sauce unless it's prepared by a chef. Three small dollops of goat cheese added a wonderful flavor and texture.  The spaghetti squash was the best I've ever eaten...tasted like fine vermicelli pasta from a fancy Italian restaurant...no moisture or dripping into the bowl. Simply perfect!  Service was great too! They boxed up my leftovers at the table in a very lovely way using two spoons. Caitlan was our server. She was friendly but very attentive and professional.   Highly recommended! I'm looking forward to going back.",

(But when they get busy and long waits people sit behind you which is kinda annoying when you are trying to enjoy your meal)  The spinach artichoke dip was amazing! (I ate it so quickly i forgot to take a photo) next up, the meal. The steak and broccoli i ordered was medium rare. It probably was closer to rare once i cut it up. I would have preferred it a bit more cooked. But next time I'll try medium.   I love the flavor of the broccoli it's delicious! The presentation of the food was ok... i mean for the price i think they should make it look a little nicer or at least a cleaner plate when you receive your food.  (I'm not that picky, just a thought for how nice of a restaurant they are that it should look presentable)   Overall it was a good visit and I'll be back.",

They never used to take reservations and that morning I made my reservation online. I started with the house salad  and had the Double Cut Pork Chop. My wife had the French Dip Sandwich which was made with prime rib. The salad was fresh and the croutons where crisp on the outside and soft inside. Best crouton I've had ever. You only get 3-4 on the salad, wish I had more. The Pork Chop was cooked perfectly as well as the braised cabbage and mashed potato. The whole staff was polite and helped each other, clearing plates, bringing water and also your order. Very nice atmosphere. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "This is the first time I've paid over $100 for a nice dinner for two and actually felt like it was worth it! As a picky eater I've learned most fine dining establishments like to create weird and unfamiliar concoctions of flavors and textures while charging a lot of money.  I like that Houston's has a 'normal' menu in addition to some of the fancier choices.   For a starter we ordered the cocktail shrimp, and they are HUGE! Definitely worth the $18 for four shrimp of this size and quality!  My wife ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye (medium rare) while I had the filet (medium-well, and butterflied). The steaks arrived seasoned and cooked perfectly! The quality of the steaks was excellent. No matter how good a chef might be, it's end-result depends greatly on the quality of the cut of meat. There was no chewy fat at all on my filet - the way it should be!  The french fries are exactly like the fries from In-N-Out Burger. This is a good thing!!! They are fantastic!  Coke is served in the bottle. Kind of a shame, when you run out, there are no free re-fills. I expect a restaurant of this nature would have a fountain machine for soda. A little disappointed here, but it's a nit-pick, really.  The staff and servers are all excellent. It is interesting all the female staff wear all black with bright-red lipstick. It's a neat look, though I never heard of lipstick being a uniform requirement. I just think that it's an interesting requirement. I wonder how many customers notice?  The ice cream sundae we ordered at the end of our meal is more than big enough to share! A generous helping of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with caramel and with whipped cream, candied, crispy walnuts, and a boat of chocolate sauce that tastes exactly like a melted chocolate bar! Just pour on the melted chocolate as much or as little as you like. This is a genius way to serve it, as I do not like 'rich' foods, so a little bit of chocolate can go a long way for my palette. That said, I put on more (and more often) then I have on any other sundae I've had because of how well balanced everything was.  With a salad and a BIG glass of wine that lasted the entire meal (and then some) our total was $137.00, there was $11.03 in tax added. There are suggested tips at the bottom of the receipt and, I'm happy to say, they calculated the suggested tip based on the pre-tax amount, as it should be. There are a handful of restaurants that calculate their suggested tips based AFTER tax, which is just a pathetic and sad way to trick customers to tip on tax for extra profit for them! This is NOT one of THOSE places!  The service was excellent. The food was excellent. Parking is easy. And the atmosphere is excellent! I left a generous tip ($30) and I'm looking forward to eating here again and again (when I can afford it!)   This is the first time I have spent that kind of money for dinner and really felt like it was worth every penny!",

The cheeseburger had a juicy patty and a soft bun that soaked up all of the juices.  The ribs were extremely tender with the meat falling off the bone.  I believe they were pork ribs and were served wet with a sweet bbq sauce.  The coleslaw was great...mayo base so it was pretty creamy.  The fries are awesome.  Similar to shoestring fries and perfectly salted.  Also, I've had a bite of the filet and it was pretty darn good.  Cooked medium and really tender.  This place loses stars though because the service is really hit or miss.  The waiters and waitresses can be really knowledgeable, but they go missing during times and can't be found when you need refills, more ketchup, etc.  The other thing that takes off a star is just the idea that this place serves sushi.  I'm completely turned off by that and really don't think sushi and an American steakhouse should mix.",

We have been devoted Houston's customers for nearly 20 years but recently have noticed a marked deterioration in the food quality, ordering flexibility and wait staff attitudes.  The Scottish salmon used to be grilled; now overseasoned and pan seared - not the same fine taste.  The cheeseburger used to be the \"Cadillac standard\" but no more - it seems much smaller, while buried in shredded lettuce and a bun covered in a hickory sauce - I just want a quality burger without sauces - put it on the side!  The kale salad should be good, but even the manager was inflexible about substituting for the peanut dressing - some in our party are allergic to peanuts - and they have a great Caesar dressing.  And a really good Caesar salad, why is it not on the menu? You have to know to ask for it.  The staff used to be exceptional but now seem indifferent.  While Houston's entrees are expensive, the great quality and staff always made it worth it, but as things have gone down hill, we are not in a hurry to return - there are so many better places to dine in Scottsdale.",

Last year we finally realized that they were just not up to par anymore. We took a chance and tried Houston's. Typical Scottsdale eatery. Range Rovers, posers and people not at all concerned with paying WAY too much for average food. Hamburger, pork chop, kale salad and ribs. It was just ok. Have had better for much, much less money. First go around with the pork chop plate, the potatoes were cold. Got a replacement and they tried to charge for them. No pre-dinner anything. We asked for bread and they brought a \"bread service\" which is 4 slices of rosemary bread. $1 on the bill. Really? The ribs were pretty good but at $28 they should have been. Have had much better for a little more than half of that. The staff was attentive and very friendly, no problem there. Needless to say, we will be shopping around again next year.",

I have seen people rating this $$ I think it's definitely more on the $$$ side if you and your date both decide to have entrees and a couple of glasses of vino.   On the other hand, the salads were a deal, I think only $4 with your meal and the baked potato was huge.  If you decide to share an appetizer, and a meal, you may be able to get out of here for under $100.  For me, the total came in around $165 tip included.  The staff here really shines and they and the tasty food are why I'll be a regular here.",

    "text": "The Beautiful Carin and I went to dinner with one of my business partners and his wife tonight. They suggested Houston's, and my first thought was \"no\", but you know what? I'm glad we went there for dinner. I may have eaten at nearly every Houston's in North America over the past 15 years, and sometimes it just seems a little bit repetitious...it's the same menu in Minneapolis, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and Left Overshoe, Nebraska. But...I think that's the genius of it! I like their French Dip sandwich, I like their burgers, I like their ribs, I like their soups and salads, I like they way they pour a cocktail (perfect vodka martini tonight, BTW...ice cold...like a comforting fog made of vodka...mmmmm...vodka). Anyway, I realized that I like pretty much everything I've ever had at Houston's and that I can get pretty much everything I've ever had at A Houston's at THIS Houston's! Genius! The service is attentive and now that they take ressie's, the lengthy wait for a spot in the restaurant can be a thing of the past. I do have one small quibble with the service (and it really is a quibble). I just don't really like being interrupted during my second bite to be asked \"is everything wonderful?\" It's just kind of presumptuous to ask the \"wonderful\" part, in the first place, and the wonder doesn't really kick in until I've had a few more bites...then I will be happy to let you know it was wonderful! As I say, just a quibble...they were just trying to be sure we were happy...and we were! Finally, a word about sushi at Houston's...the word is \"really?\" I love sushi, but this may be the only thing on Houston's menu that I have not tried. I just think it's reaching. When I walk into a Houston's, \"raw\" and \"fish\" aren't top of mind. But, more sushi for you guys! All in all, Houston's (all the millions and millions of locations, but esp. you, local Scottsdale location) is a solid lunch and dinner spot. It won't cost you and arm and a leg for a really decent meal in a nice relaxing atmosphere. It may not be the greatest grub you'll ever have, but it's pretty damn good! Thanks for getting me out there tonight, partner!",

    "text": "Note to management:  please bring Houston's back to Chicago, please??? I live in Chicago - but every time I am in AZ I stop in to Houston's at least once (OK, at least twice, and the first time is generally right after my plane lands).  I am a Houston's junkie.  I also used to work here in high school - but that bias has totally worn off.  And you know what?  If you worked somewhere and *still* want to eat there, the place must be doing something right. . . What is that something?  The smoked salmon appetizer, the spinach dip, the Arnold Palmer's with fresh squeezed lemonade, the Greyhounds with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, the ribs (*drool*), the key lime pie, the apple cobbler, the fries with a side of mustard honey sauce, all of the salads - should I keep going? As you can see, I love this place.  It is a classic.  Consistently top-notch service (the servers actually adhere to the customer right-of-way rule, know lots about the food, and accommodate any reasonable request, and the bartenders seem to know every patron by first name and favorite drink).  The prices seem to have crept up a bit - but I just don't mind because the positives outweigh the price.   I *heart* Houston's.  This location is a bit more low-key than the Esplanade, though in the winter and spring you should expect a wait of 30-60 minutes, as they do not accept reservations. All in all, delicious food, crisp service, and a comfy setting.  I miss you, Houston's!!!",

    "text": "Mmmm, Mmmm Good.  This place is ALWAYS satisfying.  I just had an early dinner there and had forgotten how much i loved this place since i hadn't been in a few months.   My absolute favorite meal there from start to finish is to start with the spinach dip, have the Hawaiian Rib-Eye for my entre and their Chocolate Brownie for desert w Coffee...DELICIOUS!   However, today i tried the Veggie burger out of Curiosity and it was a pleasant surprise to have that much flavor in a Veggie Burger.  It was even so filling that i had to take half home with me which i was not expecting at all.  My dad had the swordfish and my brother had the steak salad and both were wonderful.   I have never tried anything here that i didn't like. But i will say that i wouldn't recommend that you order their Sushi-not because it's not good but because it's not their specialty and i would much rather recommend a Sushi restaurant.  Besides that-the service is outstanding and the ambiance is perfect for a lunch or dinner full of conversation.  Cheers!",

    "text": "Here's an example of how much I love Houston's: I could actually tell the difference between head chefs (I remember very well the day I learned that Alex Van Uum switched to the ugly sister at 24th and Camelback).  I have someone who can vouch for me on this.  Head chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.  Appetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.  Sides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.  Wait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.  Bottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's.",

The burgers are the best I have ever had, in fact I have a hard time ordering a hamburger anywhere else but Houston's. My personal favorite is the Hickory Burger which comes with Canadian bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, and a special hickory sauce on top. The ribs are also an excellent selection. The meat literally falls off the bone with these.  I must say that I am a \"regular' for Saturday lunches but I get there right when it opens at 11 so my group and I are guaranteed our bar top table. The only bad thing about this place is that it is always busy unless you go at off times. However, to accommodate the wait, they have a beautiful outside patio that serves drinks and appetizers while you wait (I would recommend the spinach dip while you wait...you might be sad when your table arrives and there's still a little dip left).",

In fact, they love this place soooo much that the staff knows them by name and they're usually having lunch there at least three times a week.  I'm not one of them.  I just don't see what the hype surrounding this joint is all about.  I'm sure it must be because I'm a vegetarian and they definitely aren't a veggie friendly establishment, but I've given it more chances than I should have. The menu is just filled with a lot of meaty items that are hard to modify for a vegetarian, so that makes finding a meal that I'll really enjoy pretty tough.   For an appetizer though, the spinach dip is really good, just make sure you ask for bread with it instead of chips.  The prices are okay, but it definitely is a happening spot for both lunch and dinner pretty much any day of the week.  But as for me, I go elsewhere.",

My brother got a burger that was actually raw, so he took it back.   So he gets the burger back and now............  The lettuce was hot wilted the bun was soggy and the cheese was still in the shape of grated cheese.   This was obviously put in the microwave, topping and all. Completely disgusting!!!!!

I guess it pays to be honest in a semi-high end restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I really wanted to try Houstons. The prime rib we ordered was alright, and I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was TO DIE FOR! The marinade on it was perfect but the only thing was that it somewhat charred the meat since I'm guessing there was sugar in the marainade and that burns quickly. Our dishes came with a HUGE baked potato that I couldn't even finish.  Overall, I would revisit Houstons again for their Hawaiian Rib Eye and perhaps some sushi rolls.",

My friend and I we're sat in one of their plushy booths located in the raised section of the restaurant that kind of gives you a overlook of the entire joint, which is pretty neat.  Our waitress was fantabulous, she was accommodating to my friend's \"picky\" requests and she was quick with the ice tea refills (ref. King's Fish House review)! My Caesar salad and crispy shoe-string fries were spectacular and my friend enjoyed her Veggie burger minus the bun and God knows what else she asked for to be tweaked. We left here with full stomachs and slightly emptier wallets, but it was well worth it.

But Houston's always end up on the top of the list.  I can't tell you how many times in Scottsdale that I have paid $200 - $ 400 for a dining experience that was insulting. Especially the Hotels anymore; Lon's at the Hermosa, Rita's and BLT at the Camelback Inn. Poorly executed, stale, uninspired food.  To say that the service is bad gives them credit they don't deserve.  Strictly armature all the way around.  Then I come here and am blown away.

    "text": "One great thing about Houston's: CONSISTENCY! Every time I go it is great. I have never left feeling unsatisfied or pissed because I spent money on food that was terrible. I am sure this is one of the reasons why Houston's has been around for a long time.   For starters go with the Spinach Dip. Best I have ever had! They give you sour cream and salsa to mix it up a bit, but I am a purest and stick with just the chips and the dip. They have a somewhat limited selection of beers, but offer the main stays of domestic lights. They also have a beer I have grown to love, Sessions. It's an American lager, similar to Stella in taste. It comes in what looks like a Red Stripe bottle.   The service at this location has always been great. They are very attentive and are always there to fill up your water or see if you need another drink. There can be a wait here so make reservations or be prepared to wait. There is a bar to wait and grab a drink beforehand, which always makes the time go by faster.   Normally I get the Ahi Tuna entree, when they have it. It comes seared, so rare, but I look mine a little more well done and the staff is always accommodating. The seasonal vegetables that are served with most of the entrees are fresh and either steamed or sauteed perfectly, plus they put a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Good touch. I have had the cheeseburger also. It has slowly grown on me. I didn't like it at first, but it is tasty. The fries are great too. I have also had the dirty rice and beans on the side. Black beans and white rice. Nice compliment if you are having a small salad or something.   Can't say that I have had dessert. I think most of their choices have nuts in them. I despise nuts.",

After all I have heard about it and how much I liked it, I'm a bit disappointed I waited so long to check it out.  Both of us ordered the NY Strip steak with mine being medium rare. It was perfectly done and melt in your mouth tender. I'm not a big baked potato fan but that was what came with the steak (fully loaded) and it was nothing short of awesome. If all baked potatoes were like that, I'd be in potato heaven.  I will definitely be back sometime in the very near future!",

I ordered a medium-well steak, and before even tasting it, I noticed that no juice oozing while I cut through it.  I've had medium-well steaks before, and this is hands-down the driest.  Most reviews here describe a rare/medium-rare steak, so maybe it would have been much better if I ordered it medium-rare;  but that's not how I like my steak.  The manager mentioned that anything above medium and the vinegar-based marinade makes the steak drier than a normal medium-well.  Waitress should have probably mentioned that.  Returned the steak and got a prime rib; was average.  Manager was great about the exchange.  My wife had a sea bass fish - was pretty good.  Desert was pretty good too (brownie with custard and ice cream).  Service was great.    I would not go back  - somewhere like Keg is much better IMHO and more cuts/selections for similar level of service and comparable price-range.",

We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \"sorry we are closing and so longer serving\".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!",

I ordered the spinach dip as a starter and the Prime Rib French Dip for my main entree.  I found it refreshing that they had different (to me) sides compared to the California offerings.

We've been coming to this Houston's for about 15 years and the service has always been reliable and warm but our last server really raised the bar. We had JC(?) at lunch last week and his poise, polish and ease left nothing to be wanted. He has the finesse that you'd expect from fine dining. Serving is not an easy job and he really nails it. First time we've had him and we really enjoyed our experience. Went in after a rough morning and lunch completely turned that around:) Usually we have Amanda and she's the absolute sweetest. Has the warmest demeanor and always delivers a perfect meal anticipating our needs so intuitively while keeping a very smooth service. One goes out to eat to be free of stress and these two definitely achieve that here. We'll definitely be back and we'll be asking for either Amanda or JC:)",

We recently took visiting family and they are now huge fans!  They both ordered the pork chops - well done. Aarrgghh!!! Pork chops well done??? They'll be so dry and leathery But surprise, surprise. Although cooked to their specification, the chops were very moist and super flavorful. One ordered the maple glazed carrots as an accompaniment to the 2 large chops - and he nearly licked his plate clean. One of the standards are the ribs - they are consistently fall-of-the-bone delicious. It's a large order so plan on taking some home. The cole slaw was not as good as I remember, but that's a minor point (apologies to slaw aficionados!) The salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was not overly sweet, and had a nice balanced lime flavor; and some kind of hot brownie concoction with ice cream...yummmm. When one in our party dripped a little dessert on their shirt, the server was right there with soda water - how many places do that?  The atmosphere is low lit, up-scale modern steak house type of feel but not cowboy-ish. You can see the cooks working their magic in the kitchen. The only downside comment I would make is we all thought the music was a bit too loud. I understand what the reasoning is behind that, but there were four of us, at a fairly small table, and we had to speak loudly just to carry on a conversation. All in all, service is super attentive but not overbearing - the servers monitor the guests they are taking care of. And, the food is consistently fabulous.",

My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way. Here is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion. The fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.   That's good for me, bad for you.",

The sides were mediocre, a baked potato and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes taste like the kind made from flakes. Yuck.  There are no kid friendly Options so my daughter got the chicken tender plate which was horrible.  Definitely not worth the $17.  They serve soda from a bottle which is ridiculous! The lemonade is so bitter I got heart burn with every sip.  The service was ok not what I expected for the prices. Our waitress told us to stack our menus at the end of the table when we are ready to order. This was really strange to me. I like to have my menu in front of me when I'm ordering so I dont have to memorize what I want. How hard is it to check in like every other waitress.   Bottom line this is not my scene.

I have been here 3 or 4 times previously for dinner and it is always the same.  It is almost impossible to find a decent parking spot or be seated in under 20 minutes.  Well I guess good for them for having such a busy/popular restaurant.  Anyway, as per usual we were seated about 20 minutes late.  About 4 waiters/hosts/etc. came up to us to tell us how truly sorry they were so that was kinda nice.  They even gave us a spinach dip appetizer (my wife's absolute fav) on the house so that more than made up for being seated later than we should have.  I ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was excellent as always.  I LOVE the croutons.  For an entree I had the ribs per my wife's recommendation.  My wife is a huge Houston's fan and has been there dozens more times than I so I trusted her opinion on this.  Anyway, she was correct and they were excellent.  They weren't overly sauced and the meat was fall off the bone tender.  The fries that came with were also very good.  My wife got the halibut and it was just ok.  It was very plain but she enjoyed it so that's what counts.  Our friend had the filet and it looked excellent.  The food there is always pretty solid and you always know what you are going to get.  My only complaint is that because it is so busy, the waiters/waitresses/etc. get a bit overwhelmed and sometimes forget things and take a bit longer than they should.  I guess it isn't their fault but is probably Houston's fault for not hiring more service staff.  All-in-all it was a very good dinner.",

And, Saturday's you've got a great option for a Texas Firehouse Chili Cheeseburger that is out of this world!  I usually sit at the bar;  where I can usually stir up conversation with any of the other Guests looking for a damn good meal; or one of the personable bartenders (Raini, Rachel, Jason and Eric are all fabulous) or simply take in a quick light bite and view the latest sporting event on one of the HD televisions.

Geez, I like this place a lot, it's one of the few restaurants where if I had the option, I would eat there every day.         We had reservations for 6:45 and were quickly greeted and sat right down. The place is always lively, always a crowd and always a little noisy, just the way it should be. I got a tasty Jack and Diet and she a glass of white wine as we started with their famous spinach dip. Nowadays it seems every restaurant is throwing a dip of some type together, but none come within thirty feet of the deliciousness that is the Houston's spinach dip. Their chips are crispy and fresh, the spinach dip itself is so flavorful and thick and has big chunks of artichoke in it, it also comes with a side of both salsa and sour cream which compliment the dip beautifully. What a treat!         On to the main course! I moved over to a beer for the entree, Sierra Nevada Heff I think, mighty fine, and the lady stuck with the wine. I ordered the Hawaiian rib-eye (I'm drooling just typing it) and Kristen had the prime rib, both ordered medium rare. My rib-eye was absolutely incredible... the outside simply burst with this delicious Hawaiian marinade, goodness, if only I could describe the flavor, and the inside was cooked perfectly to my taste, the meat was tender and bursting with its own cow goodness. I could only manage one bite before shoving a taste in the mouth of my partner, who also declared it a natural wonder. The steak came with a potato but I opted for fries with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch for dipping. I could write a novel on these delicious fries, but just try them, get a side of their homemade ketchup as well, wow. Her prime rib was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Cooked very well, lots of meat, tasty, tender and came with a savory au jus sauce, bursting with goodness. She had the potato which came with the prime rib and looked like a football covered in cheese and bacon (not bacon bits, big chunks of bacon), and man was it good. I occasionally wondered if I chose wrong with the fries, but I didn't, shoot, order them both I say!         The only sort of negative of the night was our waitress, she just happened to be new and a little naive, or careful maybe? She was overly cautious about our age, checking our IDs more than once (I'm 28) and forgetting our drink orders twice. I completely forgive this, it was busy, she was new and had several tables, no big deal at all, she was a sweetheart.         If you have never visited Houston's, I highly recommend it, they have many dinner options and even a sushi bar! The atmosphere is super nice and inviting, it is dimly lit and romantic. I love this place. Four and a Half Stars.",

I just went there for the first time in a while last week and got a delish meal -- we split the spinach dip which comes with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream and is amazing.  My mom got her chicken tortilla salad with lime vinaigrette and I got the salmon and asked for the couscous on the side (which is delish and a little sweet with raisins in it).  They have an amazing wine selection which the bartender told me many come from local AZ wineries.  We opted for cranberry/vodkas and grapefruit/vodkas -- the grapefruit juice is fresh.",

Some of the things we have eaten since dining here for the last 6 years.  Fish Sand...Veg Burger...Veg Plate...Grilled Artichoke App...and this last time I had the Swordfish special.  I can honestly say it's always absolutely yummy.  Yes, the wine has a high mark-up but that's standard issue in the restaurant industry.  If you do have a couple glasses of wine, an app and 2 entress, expect to pay around $90 (factoring in 20% tip)  But when you you spend $90 and walk out with a pleased palate and a happy tummy...it's so worth it.   Added bonus: The servers here are like a well oiled machine.  Take a moment to watch them constantly glide around the place making sure everything is perfect.  It's kind of like a floor show.  :)",

The quality of the food is phenomenal (and the prices are in line with that) and the service is usually top-notch. The atmosphere is Southwestern Swanky so you get that cool, old school vibe. The leather booths and dark lighting gives it a classy, mysterious setting.  I'm a low carb eater so my go-to menu item is their cheeseburger (sans bun) with the vegetable of the day (make sure to ask what the veggies are and if they say spaghetti squash or brussels sprouts, ORDER THEM! They are by far my favorite). Their standard veggies, or ones they usually have all year, are sauteed spinach or broccoli with Parmesan cheese on top. The burgers are SO GOOD here because they grind them fresh in-house. You'll be paying close to $15 for one, but they are tasty.  I prefer to eat here at lunch time on the weekends when it's not so crowded. Evenings tend to feel a bit too \"formal\" and the place gets packed with the worker crowd during lunch hours on weekdays. Plus, if you go on Saturday, they have their awesome chili! Even if you choose to dine here on a weekend day, make sure you dress a bit nicer than a t-shirt and jeans. Jeans are okay, but you might feel under dressed in a t-shirt.",

It comes from the developers behind Hillstone and Banderas and is an upscale option for salads, sandwiches, steaks, fish and ribs.    The food here is top notch. When artichokes are in season, they are on the MUST ORDER list--wood fired and juicy with an amazing remoulade dipping sauce. Another great option for an appetizer is the spinach dip--mouthwatering!  For entrees I highly recommend the French Dip which is the best I've tried anywhere, the salmon (it comes medium rare so make sure to specify if you like it cooked more), and the ribs which are fall-off-the-bone wonderfulness!!!! They also have my favorite salad in the world, though it is not on the menu, you can still order it.  The Club Salad has the most amazing tempura chicken, avocado, tomato, spring greens and your choice of dressing (go for the blue cheese).  You must get dessert at least once--you may think I'm crazy for suggesting something as simple as the hot fudge sundae. But you will leave with a newfound respect for the simple sundae after trying a sundae at Houston's.",

The Brussels sprouts and excellent and the remoulade they come has no comparison. Service is always excellent and their set table design prevents large noisy parties disrupting dinner. This is why I never hesitate to choose Houston's or say yes to an invite. If you haven't eaten here, go. If you have. Keep going!",

I was looking forward to trying the grilled artichoke and was a little disappointed when they didn't have it and offered grilled Brussel sprouts instead, but it was delicious. For the main course, I had the Ruby Red Trout with broccoli and whipped potatoes. Everything was perfectly portioned. My boyfriend had the prime rib and I have to say, I don't even eat meat and it looked amazing. If I ever were in Scottsdale again I would come back in a heartbeat.",

My husband and I were addressed (after we were seated and already had drinks) and told that he was not allowed to wear a sleeveless shirt (I also had a sleeveless shirt on and a lady at the table next to us had a swimsuit coverup on with swimsuit visible).   The waitress, or hostess, not sure which role she was playing - had an XL black t-shirt in her hand and let us know this information and told my husband he could \"put it on\" or... what, leave? It was embarrassing to say the LEAST being in the middle of the restaurant cut off mid-sip of water and told this. Are you kidding me?  This place was a staple for us. We have always raved about the Hillstone restaurants and visit them every place we travel. Even thought this location is mediocre and the service is very poor, we go back for the food.  I don't think any sleeveless shirt could ever be tackier than what we witnessed today.   And it's 2016, if a lady can wear a visible swimsuit in your restaurant my husband should be able to wear a sleeveless shirt in 109 degree weather.   He obviously didn't put the the t-shirt on that was two sizes too big so we left.",

I had melt in your mouth salmon with a delicious wine and caper lemon sauce and my date really enjoyed his bbq ribs.

The drinks arrived and the server took our order for lunch.  We started to settle in and after a few minutes of taking our order a different server comes over and says, \"We request that gentlemen remove their hats in the dining room.\"  I replied with No thank you but thank you for asking, as i wasnt interested in having my hair a mess from wearing a hat while sitting in a nice restaurant.  She was a bit surprised but polite and asked me again.  I said you are requesting and i am saying, no thank you.  Granted at this point we are waiting for our lunch to come out at this point as well.  The manager then comes over and \"requests\" again. I said, no thank you again and he said, \" Well we cant serve you then.\"  I explained that i had been a customer here for 15 years approx, and had spent holidays, and celebrations and even my wife and i had our first date here.   Jason, the manager, was not interested and said if we wanted to wait for a seat at the bar we could do that instead. This is literally 5 minutes away from our lunch being plated. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE LITERALLY, ANY MINUTE, HAVING LUCH SERVED AND WE ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.  This should have been discussed as soon as a customer walks in the door. PERIOD.   DISGRACEFUL TREATMENT OF ANY CUSTOMER, MUCH LESS ONE THAT HAS BEEN EATING HERE FOR 15 YEARS!!!  Jason needs to go back to customer service training.",

Then, over the years as we've moved around we have always gone if there was one near us.  In Saratoga, it went by the name of the Los Altos Grill.  Now that we live in Scottsdale we are thrilled there is one nearby again.  We have gone quite a few times since our move thus past August.    Right now, they are having a fall menu with a side dish of Spaghetti squash with tomato chutney.  Normally I am not a big fan of spaghetti squash - however, I would eat this side dish as a main menu item every day of the week!  I absolutely love it.  Their steaks are awesome and my husband eats their ribs every time we go.  So those things are still fantastic.    If I could get the recipe for this spaghetti squash dish I would be so so very happy!    So go if you are in the area.",

The service was very casual and seemed sincere. She was slow to take a drink order but quick to speak when trying to talk about the features. From the time we actually did order food until the time we received our dinner was approx. 25 min. The pork chop my boyfriend got was great, one of our friends ordered the hawaiian flavored steak (ok), the other ordered a thai noodle salad (decent), and I got the salmon.  It was bland and nothing special at all. But then again that was my own fault for trying to get seafood at a steak place.. ha... karma. The potato was large enough for two to share and was drenched in butter and a bit over salted, but cooked nicely. The spinach was more than just aldente and was partially flavorful. What got me though on that was that it was not even cleaned. I am very aware that not every place I go to is going to meet the culinary standards I hold. it was not great but not horrible... It gets a middle of the road review for being a middle of the road chain restaurant.",

The place was popping tonight, and it is a Wednesday. It was dark and upbeat, but not stuffy by any means. The menu had many delicious options - it was difficult to make a decision.  I started with a side salad with bleu cheese. It was crazy good. It had a housemade bleu and croutons, and even had corn in it. Different and scrumptious.  For my main course, I had their baby back ribs. These ribs were easily the best I've ever had (sorry Trail Dust). They were beyond fall off the bone they were so tender. The shoe string fries it came with were so perfectly done, they didn't even require ketchup. My wife had the Thai Noodle Chicken Salad, which she dubbed as the greatest salad she has ever had. My mother had the Rotisserie Chicken and Couscous. She was also very happy with her meal.  For dessert we shared the Belgian Hot Fudge Sundae with Candied Pecans. Damn it was sinfully delicious.  All in all, a perfect meal. 5 stars, with ease.",

The menu has been scaled down since my last visit, so I decided to try the Flying Tuna Platter.  Very good, though a bit pricey.  My friend had the ribs, and thought they were very good as well.    I don't know why I've stayed away so long.  I'll definitely go back more often!",

    "text": "Hate to rain on the parade given all the positive ratings, but my review is based upon actual experience and not some fluffy \"great place\" reviews.  I arrived there at 4:00 pm and met a business associate for a cocktail ($15 for a glass of cheap wine that other bars serve for $7).  At 5:00 pm the manager comes over and says that we either have to order a meal or leave.  It's all about money, and they need the small table for 2 that we are at.  We left and I will never return again.  We were talking quietly, not bothering anyone.  Our crime was sitting at a table for 2 when the dinner crowd began to arrive.  If that is your definition of a great restaurant, you can have this place.  I'll go elsewhere.  As I am the CEO of a mid-size business, this will hurt them more than they might think, but I've never had this happen before in my lifetime.",

I have eaten everything from the smoked salmon appetizer, to the tuna salad, to a steak dinner and it was always well presented and delicious.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but I guess that is to be expected at a nice restaurant in Scottsdale.    The atmosphere is great if you want an intimate setting.  The booths are cozy and arranged so you don't hear 3 other tables' conversations.  Last time I went they had a very pleasant Jazz band playing in the background.  Also, the bar is a great place to sit if you are alone and just want a good meal and a drink.    I should also note this is a very busy restaurant and the wait times can be long.  If you have a big party or want dinner on the weekends, I recommend booking a reservation.",

We were recommended this place by a friend because of how much my bf loves french dips. We figured for $19 and the rave reviews it would be a great sandwich. If you love bread, not a lot of meat and sub par au jus, then this would be the sandwich for you. I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.  I ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it.   All in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back.",

Seeing as how I love french dip so much and am always hunting for the best food, we decided to eat here.    First, I was pretty disappointed in quality to price ratio.   Not only was this thing tiny (like half the meat you get for 10 bucks at a bar) but the fries were pretty tasteless and not cooked well done like I asked.    I get a better French dip at the local pub for 8 bucks with more meat and better French fries.  Will not be going back.",

Service can be a tad stuffy if you are someone who likes to chat up your servers, but man are they on point!  I come here every on a monthly basis, that's how much i L.O.V.E. this place. It is great for a date or special occasion, or when you just want a yummy in your tummy dinner. However, it is not good for groups... I don't believe you can get a table for more than 5 people.  Their menu is very broad from salads and sandwiches to ribs and sushi. I have always loved their French dip... opt for the baked potato instead of fries. Recently I gave up eating meat FOR A WHOLE YEAR (thank you, it was a feat), and their veggie burger was the best I've had anywhere. I still order it from time to time, even now eating meat again. Again, opt for the baked potato. If you like potatoes, just play it right and ALWAYS opt for the baked potato!   Great wine selection, something for every palate and decent price points. The ambiance is perfect and definitely save room for dessert. They have an AMAZING key lime pie and pant button popping hot fudge sundae.  Definitely try to make a reservation if you are going in on the weekend. Sitting at the bar is also nice and a little more casual.  Parking is super easy... and guys, leave your hat at home!",

The servers aren't exactly the best. I feel like if there wasn't an 18% forced gratuity for parties of 5 or more, the servers wpuld be a little more hospitable. Overall the food was average. The Hickory burger comes with a ridiculous amount of cheese. The Canadian bacon tasted very slimey and overcooked. The Smoked Hiclory Salmon was mostly a plate of white bread. The salmon was cold and undesirable. The Biltmore Chicken Sandwich was one of the only good dishes. Overall my experience here was not the best. The selection was poor and I wouldn't like to come here again unless the menu was expanded.",

We decided to split the fresh seasonal veggie plate and the tuna salad (which is now served with the tuna in a sushi roll).  Still the same salad - and although we both like it sashimi style like they used to do, the roll was yummy, fresh, and great quality - like everything on Houston's menu.

We were very happy to know our favorite restaurant was also here in Scottsdale when we moved here some years ago.  All in all, we have eaten more times at Houston's in the past 38 years than all the other comparably priced restaurants we have eaten at combined. The food, atmosphere and service are consistently that good.    Now that we are up in years, we don't typically eat as much food as we used to, and frequently will split a meal such as the ribs.  Not shown on the menu is that for $6.00 more, they'll add six more ounces of ribs above the standard rack, which is a perfect amount for the two of us along with the sides and wine.  If you like espresso, they make the best I've had anywhere.  It is essentially a double and very aromatic and rich--better then even my home-brewed version using my Illy machine.  The staff are always friendly, engaging if you invite it, and efficient.  I've joked that the manager and his staff could operate a Nuclear Submarine if called upon--everyone knows their job and does it well.  Many of the staff have been there since we've been going there and know our names and treat us like friends of the family.  Such great service with the great food adds to a great dining experience.  Try this restaurant and you very likely will have a new favorite.",

The staff said that they would although I did not notice a real profound difference.  We started out with the smoked salmon which was really good.  They gave us a good chunk of fish which had a nice smoky flavor.    I then chose the French dip sandwich which was very good as well.  There was a good amount of meat which was nice and juicy and just tasty. The accompanying fries were good, although slightly overseasoned for my taste.  Service was good - there were lots of staff available around who would unobtrusively ensure that my water glass was filled.

My husband and I arrived just before 5pm, since they don't serve them until 5.  We sat at the bar as I did two years ago when I last tried eaging here.  I really didn't think I would ever eat here again due to the really poor experiences during my limited visits over the past few years.  News flash - you can mess up a baked potato.  Houston's, please make note of this.    When our potatoes arrived, I was enjoying a truly lovely glass of ZD Chardonnay.  Our potatoes were nicely loaded, and accompanied by extra bacon and chives.  We dived in, prepared to be fully satisfied.  The potatoes never got good.  I couldn't figure out what was ruining the experience for awhile.  The toppings were as great as ever... It finally hit me as we drove home feeling less than satisfied.  The potatoes were extremely dry and grainy - there was none of the anticipated creaminess to the potatoes.  They were overcooked.  At 5pm, they were overcooked.  Even butter (which I don't usually have), sour cream and cheese couldn't fix overcooked.  Note to self, REALLY, never again.  Over the past few years, Houston's has been hit or miss for others as well.  This is not just me.  Sad since I literally used to eat here several times a week in spite of the expense.   Houston's used to have a great menu that they executed PERFECTLY - every single time.  I track the downward trend to the point at which they decided that it made sense to add sushi to their menu - something that they didn't do well at all.  The transition in Phoenix from Houston's to Hillstone, though subtle, left me with no interest in returning there after a few tries.  Banderas in Old Town Scottsdale lost its footing at about the same time in terms of long standing customers.   REALLY, Never Again.",

This evening we decided to give it a try to see if there were any improvements. As usual, the place looked very inviting, the wait person was very friendly and the service was good.  However, self ordered a cheeseburger which arrived cut into 4 quarters, which meant that each section was so small it was impossible to put any dressing on it. Lifting the bun meant the sandwich fell apart! This is about the most inane way we have ever been served a hamburger!  Not to mention the sloppy mess it left all over my hands. The best thing about it was the laugh that we had about the idiocy of the person who thought of serving a hamburger this way.  The side of French fries was very spare and barely warm.   Guess we have to think long and hard, most especially very long before we go back to Houston's. We can only recommend it for it's ambiance & the pleasantness of the staff.  Maybe next time they will serve peanut butter and jelly with the crust cut off and sliced into eighths.  Kindergarten style.",

The place is dark but elegant in its own way.   We started off with the Spinach & Artichoke dip. The tortilla chips were nice and crispy. It came with a warm spinach and artichoke dip, salsa, and sour cream. Oh my goodness, the warm dip was so good. Out standing. We were licking every drop of it. We even got another bowl of chips to finish everything off.   I ordered the famous French dip sandwich. When I first ordered it, it doesn't sound too exciting but wow. Thinly cut prime rib with this really soft bread and dipping it the sauce made it outstanding. It was like melt in your mouth goodness.   My wife and son ordered their go to dish of a full rack of baby back ribs. They are fall off goodness. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. Really like these ribs. The sauce really makes it so good. They had cole slaw to and it was good and goes so well with the ribs. Nice and creamy. I shared with my wife and it was so good.   The service was good. Usually it's outstanding but today we ordered our appetizer and needed a few minutes to order but it seemed like she got lost and took awhile to get back to us. That was the only negative but our water cups were bought to us very quickly. Refilled regularly and took our dirty plates on a timely manner.   Loved coming here. Great food,  good service, and a really nice ambience. We'll be back again but not to long like last time. Enjoy",

Cajun chicken breast, ham, Swiss cheese and sliced tomato. Sounds pretty good right? Wrong!    It was terrible! No flavor whatsoever! It also came with about an inch of arugula piled on it. No mention of this on the menu. Arugula should be used sparingly on very specific things. Way too strong for an already flavorless sandwich. I had to pick it all off, then asked for a large side of mayonnaise to help choke the sandwich down.    I will certainly be back, but I will stick with the other items I usually order. Houston's, why do you have I get cute with your sandwiches? Bring back a regular club that people really enjoy!    I laughed to myself as I was getting ready to leave. There was a man sitting at a nearby table who sent the same sandwich back saying \"this is the worst sandwich I have ever had\". Me too sir! Me too!  I should have sent mine back!  Beware Houston's customers. The grilled chicken sandwich is terrible!!",

The staff was fantastic and well-trained, to the point that they visibly cleared a path when you walked down the aisle to the restroom - it was a bit more than 'just' stepping aside. It was lunch, we'd already had a snack so really weren't looking for a big meal. The menu wasn't huge, but there were great choices.  I had the (I believe it's called) \"Flying Chicken\" and my hubby had a burger (I think it was a barbecue burger). He says his burger was perfect and full of flavor. The chicken tenders were SO very lightly battered and fried, thus the 'flying' reference in the name. They were cooked perfectly. The chicken tenders were served with two sauces, honey mustard and BBQ. The chicken was so good that I tried the sauces, just for the sake of trying them, but didn't use them beyond the initial taste (but they were good).  The burger came with fries, I didn't even ask the hubs what he thought about them. He said he was VERY pleased at the end of the meal - so I'll suggest he thought they were good. The chicken tenders were served with a tasty slaw. I'll almost bet they made it themselves, it doesn't taste anything like any I've had before.  The place was comfortable, comfortable living room-like wood and dark colors. But it wasn't so dark that you couldn't see who was sitting in front of you. If you have a chance, I highly suggest you go. We'll be back again, perhaps for dinner next time.",

Drinks took abnormally long to come out and refills were slow to be completed. Food order was taken and I asked that my steak be seasoned with Cajun season before it's cooked. The server said they were not able to do it, which I found odd since it was done for us three months ago. I asked that an inquiry be made with the Chef. The server returned and said they can bring it to me on the side but not season it with it. Anyone who has ever cooked a steak knows you have to season it before the cook.  At any rate our food comes out around 20 minutes later. After about 12 minutes we flagged a manager down to get refills and missing condiments. He returned seconds later dropped off the refills and just walked away without asking if we needed anything else. Like a replacement potato since the ones we received were cold or to check on the steaks that were somehow overcooked and cold at the same time. Another 20 minutes later the server appeared and asked about desserts. In my head all I can think is how about how was dinner, an apology for not checking on us!  At any rate overall this was a miss, and severely disappointing seeing as this is one of our favorite place.",

Even if you think it won't be busy, just play it safe and make a reservation because chances are you will be waiting a while if you don't. I make a reservation every time for that reason, and even so I sometimes still end up having to wait for 5-10 minutes. But hey it's better than waiting 30min-1hr without a reservation.",

    "text": "I will start this off by saying this was one of the strangest dining experiences I've had.   My wife and I went there with two other friends a few weeks ago. So, first, we go to order the appetizer. We put in for two appetizers, one including the grilled artichokes (not realizing it is not in season). Our waitress says ok and a little while later one of the appetizers comes out. We ask about the artichokes and she tells us they don't have them it's not in season. Well..why didn't you tell us that 10 minutes ago when we ordered them and you said ok?????  Anyways, then we go to order the entree. My friend orders the Arctic Char, which we were told they were out of as they just sold the last one (it's 6:15p on a Monday). Then the ladies try to order the Prime Rib. Well...turns out the kitchen *just placed a new Rib on the rack and it's going to be 40 minutes if we want that. Keep in mind this is a nice restaurant with a limited menu, so at this point the question really becomes what do you have available? (I was never a waiter, but shouldn't the staff tell you up front about all the menu issues rather than wait for customers to order and then say oh we don't have that?)  Then HERE is the strangest part, although relatively trivial. My friend has a Manhattan and is midway through his drink. Our waitress comes around, doesn't speak, but picks up his cocktail, casually transfers it to a new, chilled glass and walks away. MID COCKTAIL! I would have thought that was weird had she asked to do it, let alone just pickup and mess with someones drink. We had a good laugh about that. I have never seen that before.   At the end of our meal, our waitress clearly knew we were upset about the menu issues, so she starts laying down forks. We thought the meal was over but turns out they were giving us 2 free desserts for the trouble. I understand and appreciate the gesture, but the 2 desserts that came out were based on the presumption that:  1. We wanted to stay a while longer 2. We actually wanted dessert  Why not just comp the $12 appetizer?  In all, this was not a horrible dinner (food was good) but we don't go out to nice places like this all that often. So, when we do, I think it's fair to expect a level of service that warrants spending north of $100 and this was certainly not the case. While I used to love coming to this restaurant, I doubt we will return. Too many other options just down the street.",

It's a great place for two to grab dinner in the bar or for a group to eat at the community table or you can sit in the dining room which is very comfortable.  The best way to start out your experience is with a grilled artichoke.  I don't know how they do it but the flavor is like no other.  The filet is one of the best in town and if you want an amazing French dip sandwich, you must try it here.  The fries are freshly cut and made and are out of this world.  The Thai steak salad with mango is one of the best if you want something lighter.  For dessert, the only option you must choose is the hot fudge Sunday.  The hot fudge is served on the side and you can pour as much as you would like on top of the ice cream.  I suggest going heavy with the fudge!",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with the fact that I have never written a restaurant review, and made an account on yelp just to do so. I am so disappointed with not only the food but the service at this location. We dined on 9/23/2018 at 6:30pm.   I went to Hillstone in Cherry Creek Colorado and had such a wonderful experience and the food was excellent. I gave my Family a gift certificate in hopes they would have the same experience in Scottsdale.   We were having a family event and I suggested that we go to Houstons. I have never been disappointed before by this company and thought it would be the perfect place to celebrate.   The food came out cold and it took a very long time to even get someone over to help us. When I got the attention of a manager walking by, he seemed very disinterested in the situation. He didn't offer any apologies or offer to have the food remade. The manager took the plates and asked if we wanted them warmed up.   The salmon was slimy and cold, the potatoes were Luke warm. The chicken that was served was mostly breading and also Luke warm. Again there were no apologies or an attempt to remake our dinner. It took over a half hour to get our food heated.   The manager never stopped back to check on us or to see how our food came out.  The waiter did apologize with how long it took to warm our food back up.   We waited over a half hour just to receive warmer food. This is unacceptable.   If the management staff had tried to make our experience better or had even checked back with us to see how our food came out, I don't believe this review would have been written. That being said, service is everything. The food should be your specialty, but your staff creates the experience.   My experience at your restaurant tonight, and the experience my family had was not one that will have us returning. If fact it is one that has me advertising that you are not the place to dine in Scottsdale.   Again, I will not be recommending Houston's in Scottsdale to my clients, friends, or family in the future.  If you are looking for an excellent dining experience, I would not recommend this location.",

My husband and I were on our way to their restaurant about 20 mins away from our house. We didn't have a reservation so we definitely expected to wait, but called ahead just to see if it was even worth our time. The hostess told him over the phone that there were currently no walk ins so the wait time would be minimal. A lot can happen in 20 mins, and of course when we get there the waiting area was jammed packed. We put our name in and the hostess said about 40 mins. No problem, we expected somewhat of a wait. Well an hour and twenty minutes go by and there were still 7 people ahead of us, supposedly. I understand that a restaurant like this will be busy all the time. However, a realistic expectation at the time of us walking in would have made us quickly realize we need to find somewhere else. Unfortunately, we did go somewhere else after already waiting an hour and twenty minutes. I know we weren't alone with this and there were several frustrated customers with the same problem. Just be realistic with your wait times, please. It's very disappointing.",

We ordered it medium and it was fantastic! I really suggest you try it! We had vege sides that were delicious. The seasonal corn, broccoli, and roasted Brussels sprouts (so good!).

I'm giving this place 5 stars because my wife can't say enough about it and we have friends who eat here EVERY DAY when they vacation in Scottsdale.  They rave over the sundaes and the veggie burgers.  If it was just me, I'd give it 4 stars.  On our first visit, my wife got the veggie burger (which is made on site) and she said it was the best she's ever had.  I am a burger and fries guy and I found the hickory burger to be flavorful and cooked properly.  They don't give you many fries but this seems to be the norm for upscale restaurants.  What makes this place for me is the ambiance and the excellent, attentive, friendly wait staff.  ALL the waiters are very friendly, not just YOURS who is looking for a good tip.  You can tell the difference when friendliness is part of their training.  We did share a hot fudge sundae.  You should get a hot fudge sundae.  Here's the thing about those.  You get a generous helping of ice cream, whipped cream, and then your own pitcher of what I can only assume is their own chocolate sauce.  I have had better tasting sauces, but no one has ever let me decide how much sauce I want on it, so the pitcher on the side was pretty cool.  I happen to like a lot of sauce so I added more sauce every couple of bites.  Note... we returned late the next night for another round of Sundaes.  We each got our own.  This is when I found out they had whipped cream.  My wife, apparently, ate the whipped cream on our first one without me noticing.",

    "text": "I used to LOVE this restaurant, but after some recent experiences, I plan to take my business elsewhere.  Their service remains excellent, but food quality has seriously soured.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.  The fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.  I would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.  I have other restaurants that are tastier.",

The wait staff is extremely polished and doesn't disappoint!   Notable dishes: Artichoke Dip: as other Yelp reviewers have attested - this is probably the best artichoke tip I've ever tasted. Chicago style and comes with salsa (if your friends are picky eaters, sell them on that and keep the dip for yourself, chip refills are free.)  Hawaiian Rib Eye: this pineappley marianade is the bomb.  Sushi Menu: unexpectedly good for an American restaurant--the other dishes are worth trying first but the rolls can be great apps for the table.",

I contemplating composing a novel based off my recent HORRIBLE  experience but I will keep it short. Here we go, #1 I have dinned at this restaurant NUMEROUS times and one thing I liked about Houstons is that it has always been pretty consistent (until recently). I have a home right across the street so its a place I frequent often. However the last couple visits of mine  I have noticed this place has been slipping (food quality, service, cleanliness etc.) My latest visit will definitely be my last. I sent my cold, not cooked chicken entree back twice and management handled the entire situation poorly. I am not that crazy customer looking for a free meal. I understand not everything can come out perfectly every time. However something I do expect to be handled properly each time is customer service and management failed miserably yet again. Mistakes happen I get that but this management team needs to treat their customers with respect regardless of race, demographic and how many bottles of wines they have ordered. Please do your research when looking for your next night out on the town in Scottsdale you can do much better!",

Got to the restaurant and they could not find my order. After 20 minutes, they find it, no apology, then they prepared my order. Ribs were over cooked, some of them were black and over cooked, coleslaw was good, Spinach artichoke dip was ice cold when I got home, had not even been heated. Fries were greasy. What happened to this once great place. Now, this small order was $50 and horrible. They will stay in business because the snowbirds will frequent it but locals, beware.",

He had one and a half drinks, we were seated at a table for dinner, my husband stepped up to the bar with our friend Kevin just to have a conversation away from the table and get another drink and the bartender refused to serve him. And the way she did it was very rude and embarrassing. We had already ordered our dinner and they had just brought our appetizers, but after talking to the manager who supported the bartender, we got up and left. Here we are at Sumomaya having a fabulous time. We will NEVER EVER go back to Houston's again and will urge our friends do the same.  I have never seen my husband so insulted and angry as tonight. And it started out so well with my husband having a good time talking to a gentleman named Mark who has been on the board with Bob Bondurant since 1988............you're missing out Houston's........we're here year round when all the snowbirds go back to wherever and ate here regularly......you need a lesson in diplomacy!

They are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  Also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - SERIOUSLY?! (the waitress knew as she said \"oops, I forgot the candle\")  Between that and charging $3 PER soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.    The food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  You can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at J Alexanders.  Houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it.",
