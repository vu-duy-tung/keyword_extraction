Turnips and five spice yumminess and the fried tofu with dried scallops which fakes us into eating vegetables and is a unique and delicious dish!  EVERYONE is happier at Nee House these days and the karma is better because of it!",

I would characterize her as the Soup Nazi without the hard and fast rules you need to learn, but it could come off to some as rude.   Many local Chinese eat their and even in large groups so it even further validates that it is 100% authentic and its very tasty food!!!",

Salt and pepper pork chops: perfectly seasoned with just enough batter and spices.  2. Lobster with XO sauce:  plentiful with lots of yummy flavors.  Can be spicy depending on the jalapenos.  3. Salt and pepper squid: perfectly battered pieces of squid (no legs though-boooo), deep fried to absolute perfection!  4. Beef Chow Fun:  yummy flat rice noodles with tender pcs of beef, sprouts, onions, and green onions.  5. Chinese broccoli: not on the menu but ask if they have it in stock.  It's sauteed with some garlic and dried fish for an awesome \"sauce\".   The prices are reasonable (not expensive at all compared to CA) and we ALWAYS eat here on every visit to AZ!",

    "text": "I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with Nee House. They treat me like shit but I keep coming back for more because their authentic dishes make me love them long time (inappropriate? Eh). I mean, it's never a shock when I come in and the staff makes me feel as if I just dropped into their home without calling first, but today they really turned me off with their rudeness.  I go in at about 2:45pm with my daughter for lunch. There is only one table being used. The woman points to the table right next to the only people eating at the restaurant. So, I smile but went one table over and sat down. The woman comes out of the kitchen and says \"no, can you sit at that table over there?\" I looked at her as if questioning why I couldn't sit at the table I had chosen, and she pointed to one of the large, family-style tables right next to the table I had chosen, and said \"they're going to have dinner\". I moved, but was very perplexed as to what the issue was. Aren't all the tables there for a reason? And who eats dinner at 3 in the afternoon? Anyway, I shook it off and ordered the shrimp and eggplant in Szechuan sauce; it was amazing, as usual. My daughter enjoyed her chicken lo mein. What I didn't love is how the waitress brought out one dish way before the other, and never acknowledged our numerous friendly \"thank you's\". She just had this energy that yelled \"this is the last thing I want to be doing right now. Why are you here?!\"  Then....the staff starts coming out of the kitchen to that table that I wasn't allowed to sit near. THAT'S why I couldn't sit there?! I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim \"it's about the food, not the service\", that is ridiculous too. When you eat out, the way you are treated as well as how delicious the food is contributes to your experience as a whole. Is the food good? Absolutely. Does this mean that it's a good experience? Probably not.   I vowed to never go back....at least until I get another craving for that shrimp dish-- with a side of jerk sauce.",

    "text": "A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing.   We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.  Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.  The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House.",

I'm currently trying to work through the menu since I almost always get the same dish!  My recent find was the Rock Cod in Black Bean Sauce and XO Scallops.  These were so good that they are now the dishes that I must deny myself to continue my journey through the menu.  I wish I had started exploring earlier.  In case you want to know, my old favorite dish was the seafood with crispy noodles.  Oh, now I'm craving that one!  darn, looks like Nee House tonight!",

They were $5.99   My husband had General s chicken.  He asked for it because it was not on the menu.  It was very crispy and tasty. I had fried pork chops with salt pepper because I had never had that.  Very interesting presentation.  A little salty for my taste but delicious.  Everything is a la carte.   She asked us if we wanted steamed rice which we did.  It is a very busy popular place  there were regulars there.  We will go again soon",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME!  I'd recommend everyone take management's advice and try your entree with the chef's hair...it truly is something you won't get anywhere else (we'll...you'll get it here and there, but mgmt probably won't promote it).    If you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).    My first reaction was that this was crazy, but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type, more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!  Well, it is May, but Happy St. Patty's Day, and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.    Tip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).  She will make sure you get the royal treatment.",

Usually when we have eaten here we get it to go because the service is poor.  This time I drove nearly 20 minutes to come pick up the food, I picked it up I brought it home and we started eating. Then a fly was discovered in one of the dishes. We called and said we were going to want a refund the lady we spoke to was not going to give us a refund unless we brought the food in. I didn't mind that but she was argumentative over the phone. I packed up the food, and drove all the way back and brought it into the store. I walked in, and I was quiet, she came up to me and said \"let me see\" she took the bag I had and just started walking towards the back. Then she went into the kitchen, I could hear her talking but since I do not speak Chinese I did not know what she was saying. She then came out and the first thing out of her mouth was, \"You ate a lot of the food so I am not going to give you all your money back\". I said, I had no problem with that but I do have a problem with the attitude you are giving me. I said, \"I understand things like this happen but you have not been courteous to us at all\".  She gave us half of our money back in cash. She said people try to fake things like this all the time. I said I know, I use to work in a restaurant, I know how people try to scam things. I told her thank you and walked out.   I understand them wanting to see the food and making sure we were not lying but there was never one time she said I'm sorry for the inconvenience or anything like that. Not even sorry there was a little insect in your dinner.  This really sucks because no matter how good the food usually is, the rudeness and dis-respectfulness will keep me from coming back....

We've been going here since they first opened.  At that time it was very basic; their plates and cups didn't even match.  But the food was always great. One thing to keep in mind if your dining in:  They bring each dish as it's ready, so there could be a 5 minute delay between the time  each dish is served, but it's only a problem if your are not sharing dishes. Go there, you won't be sorry.",

I think it may have been 2003 or 2004 that i frist started going to Nee House. It seems like it was called some thing eles a couple of years earlier or it was under different ownership. But when we finally decieded to give it a try. We were so happy we did. Nee House became our place to go for yummy chinses food.   Some things i ordered all the time were mustard greens and black mushrooms. Which was Many steamed mustard greens or bok choy with WHOLE black mushrooms in the center with a delicious sauce placed around both. And eggplant w/ spicy garlic sauce. Rock Cod fish fillet with vegetable, fish filet with ginger and green onion. And several other items. The food has and always was delicious.portions were always perfect. We always went in a small group of 3 or 4 friends. And i cant recall ever any of us having a bad dinning experience at Nee House. Im suddenly at a loss because i havent found a chinese restaurant as good as Nee House in my new home. Dreaming of the spot on,  great Chinese food at Nee House. At least i have the wonderful mermories. Which is making me salivate just dreaming about it rite now. :)",

This week I ordered the exact same thing but asked for the sauce on the side. They charged me $16.28, My wife called them thinking maybe there was an error,  The owner informed her that there was a $2 charge for having the sauce on the side. We we're charged $3.26 more not $2. To top things off all you get is sauce, chicken, bean sprouts and onions. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Unfortunately, we we're regulars at Silver Dragon but they closed down. The only reason we ordered from Nee House was because of it's close proximity to our residence. We'll be sure to take our business elsewhere.",

    "text": "Nee House is the bee's knees! No seriously though, after living in Los Angeles for the last 8 years and my frequent trips to the Bay area have exposed me to some absoutley delicious  mind blowingly good chinese food... Said mind blowingly good chinese food is hard to find here in the Valley, that was until my darling boyfriend let me in on what I consider one of his best kept secrets. I mean seriously though, you may chuckle a bit at that statement but know this... I love my food, he loves his food so when two foodies end up together you know your serious when they decide to let you in on one of the fav secret foodie spots.   So here is the 411 on the good, the bad and well maybe not the ugly.   The Good Stuff: I knew it was love at first sight when I walked in and saw tanks with live fish, crabs and lobsters! Tell me the last time you entered a resturant in Arizona, mind you a hole in the wall chinese joint that has flippin fresh live fish that aren't for decoration but rather to be consumed and doused in the delicious flavors that is Nee House. A word to the wise, get the peking duck... a whole huge duck, perfectly prepared, moist with ever so crispy skin and freshly steamed bao buns for $33.00, it's not for the faint of heart or really the appetite challenged! The shrimp with snow peas is delicious, as is the fried rice and well pretty much everything I have ever ordered from this joint (not a huge fan of their kung pao but thats my opinion)  The bad: While service wasn't bad per say, It wasn't great. The staff there was super friendly once we sat down and  they happily assisted us when we needed them, but they aren't super attentive nor did they go out of their way, and they can be a tad bit slow at times but really - when you have chinese food this good, I don't care about the service - just make sure you keep making that delicious food of yours!  So I know the boyfriend will be upset with me for ratting out this secret gem, but he knew he started dating a Yelper so really he knew food secrets don't stay that way for long!",

    "text": "The short: Delicious, authentic food in generous portions; polite, quick, and attentive service; clean and well-lit generic ambience.   The long: We decided to go here because we'd heard the food was great, but after reading reviews about poor service during the drive up, I almost changed my mind. I'm so glad I didn't! While the service wasn't that overbearing \"fake-friendly\" you see at a lot of places, the three servers who worked our table were just fine.   Located in a plain, well-weathered shopping center on the northeast corner of Tatum and Thunderbird, the place really isn't much to look at. It's clean, and during our early dinner, light streamed in through the windows.   We ordered the Pu Pu Platter, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, Rock Cod Fish Fillet with Vegetable, and Honey Walnut Shrimp, and everything came out reasonably quickly, with plenty of time to enjoy our appetizer. While we enjoyed everything, the Pu Pu Platter was our least favorite. The Hibachi's flame was a little out of control, which was hilarious, but we set the skewers on fire when we tried to char our skewered beef. The fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, and BBQ pork were nothing special, but the paper wrapped chicken (wrapped in foil) was a nice change as well as the most authentic thing on the platter.  The flavorful eggplant melted in our mouths, just the way I love it, but it could've used a bigger knock of heat, so I'll have to make sure to request it next time. The generous serving of honey walnut shrimp was also delicious, with plump, crispy fried shrimp and fresh candied walnuts in a sauce that wasn't too sweet or greasy. The rock cod was our favorite, with a lot of tender, moist pieces of fish mixed in with the tender baby bok choy and fresh carrots. It tastes just like my boyfriend's mom's version. And of course, the rice was fresh, piping hot, and fluffy.   While there are dozens of Chinese places between our house and Nee House, I'd gladly make the drive up here again to try more dishes and order what have already become favorites.",

Excellent lunch menu with a few dozen options to choose from, they specialize in hot and spicy foods but will make anything for you with no heat by request. They serve excellent fish dishes, including lobster and crab which is killed and cooked to order. Other seafood offered includes abalone, sea cucumber, squid, clams, oysters, cod, shrimp, scallops. Average dish runs about $9-$13, a whole Peking Duck is under $30. Love both the Wor Wonton and the Hot & Sour Soup, really the only weak item on the menu is the ribs appetizer which has too much sugary sauce and is pricey for the amount of ribs given. Love their Shredded Pork Schezuan Style, Baked Pork Chop With Salt & Pepper, Braised String Beans and Sizzling Plate Steak With Black Pepper (very unique, well worth trying!). They will make you Shrimp With Lobster Sauce with either brown or white sauce. Can't recommend this place highly enough even if you have to drive an hour to get there!",

Having grown up in NYC and living in Boston as an adult, this is NOTHING like Chinatown.  In New York they are smart enough to realize that repeat business is where it is at. The cost of new customer acquisition is too high. After getting apps on our table, a suspect hair was noticed on a plate. Ok, let's cut to the chase...it was a pube! When we pointed it out, there was no concern whatsoever. It comes as no surprise that this could happen as the bathroom is filthy and constantly has nothing to wipe your hands with -- I guess tonight they used my plate.

Moved here 6 mos ago from the SF Bay Area and was really disappointed in the lack of tasty food (don;t get me wrong - I love my new desert home), but it takes a while to find new favorites.  I've found one in Nee House.  The only thing I haven't liked here is due to a personal preference - not the food itself (I loathe green onions or rather - it's a mutual loathing!!!  cuz these things just don't want to die!!!).  The service is good and can accomodate large parties well if you call ahead.  I was surprised to read other posts about lack of friendliness and service as that has never been my experience - even before I was a regular.  Hey, we all have bad days - or aren't as \"chipper\" as others think we should be sometimes, right?  Anyway - I am SO glad to have found Nee House.  It's a keeper. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Before you go to Nee House, be forewarned...... service is not great and there is no ambience to speak of.  However, it is the only Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale (that we've found) that serves authentic Chinese food!  Our primary residence is in Chicago and we grew up Chicago's Chinatown. We stay in the Troon North area when we are here and until now, we have been driving to \"Chinatown\" in Phoenix.  The food is good, authentic and fresh.",

    "text": "My sister and I have gone here a few times, she likes it, I think the food is bland and BORING.  The service is NON-Existent and rude.  Tonight, Sunday before New Years we went and the place was like an ICE BOX.  I asked the waiter to please turn the AC off.  It was only 66 degrees on their thermometer and the a/c was still on.  It is December and it was raining. He did nothing.  I asked the waitress, she said \"nothing I can do\".. my sister then asked Jade who owns it, and RUDE doesn't even begin to tell you. She couldn't have cared less.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Tasteless food, rude personnel and dining in a walk in Freezer is the worst experience all the way around.  AND I used the ladies room,,, FILTHY.  You could see where they had sloped some water on the floor in the center but the from 6 \" away from the wall to the wall, FILTH.  NO thanks, how they keep their license beats me, how they keep anyone coming back is even a bigger mystery, it sure isn't the service or the food, must be the only place to get Chinese in the neighborhood.  Plus they claim to be Cantonese, there hasn't been a real Cantonese restaurant in Phoenix since Toys Shangri La on 16th and Camelback closed years ago.  This place, Nee House, is a very bad excuse for a restaurant.  Stay away if you are smart.",

    "text": "This place has the best Chinese food I've had in Phoenix ~ I've searched for 2 1/2 years and tonight was delighted - at last - dang I was happy (a LOT of bad Chinese food in the Valley - YUCK and that this isn't BAD - means it's good -sad right?) So the food was dynamite times ten.  The decor, those big A___ fish in the tank look healthy enough - fairly clean - in a strip mall - whatever - Domino's is nearly next door if you are in a carry out frenzy.  But at over 50 years young, and a trained Chef - I never expected to be treated like CRAP no not CARP - and well frankly I was. This was the FIRST time I have EVER stiffed (no tip) EVER!!!!!!  Felt bizarre - but in a way it was liberating - I have tipped 20% for the WORST service in the country  (it's just part of who I am working in hospitality since I was about 17 y.o)....I was treated very well early on - told my menu choice is enjoyed by many, told how to 'manage' it as I'd never ordered this beef tenderloin in a lettuce cup.  ALL was appreciated.  Tips on making a side sauce, how to use the lettuce, how to eat the best 'bite' ~ and I LOVE using my hands to eat, create little bites - so I chose a wonderfully compatible entree.  All was well.  The wine glasses were small and not filled generously but whatever.  'House Chardonnay' was drinkable - but down it fast - it's not a sipping wine to enjoy and savor.  Okay so I told my waitress that I'd like to order carryout near the start of my experience here.  She agreed to leave the menu with me so I could do just that at the end of my meal.  When dinner was over (yes I all but licked my plate clean - not a grain of rice left)... I was ready at last ... decided I would order either some kind of vegetable chop suey - or a vegetable dish - as I had juicy scallops at home and thought an easy meal for Sunday would be seared scallops with Chinese Vegetables (I know on Cinco de Mayo right?).  My waitress wasn't around and I got this other woman - abrupt, curt and totally not like my original waitress who was basically civil/maybe slightly warm even.  I asked her, \"I would like to know if I could order a vegetable dish that is pretty much all stir fried bean sprouts - perhaps some bok choy or spinach tossed in - but primarily bean sprouts in a light sauce\" - I guess that was interpreted as \"idiot woman\".  She says no we have nothing like that.  So I went on - well how about vegetable chop suey - but 'heavy on the bean sprouts'?    She was annoyed...Bok Choy is tough, sprouts are tender you really don't want that she pontificates & ends with 'you want meat or only vegetables'  I said I WANT VEGETABLES - IN A CARRYOUT DISH with a LOT of FREAKING bean sprouts - call it what you want - and how you want - but can you or can you not do this?  She says NO - it's bad very bad - bean sprouts are way too watery to order like that.  I say, \"miss I don't really much mind eating the food that I choose to order - if I like bean sprouts - I like them & know them intimately - and I'd like to order a vegetable dish with a LOT of them - as in MOSTLY bean sprouts - think spaghetti - and you can save all the expensive vegetables for another customer.  She says, \"Okay but I have to charge you 2 dollars more\". By that time I was ready to go back to the kitchen myself and wok my veggies for home use the next day - but as it was my first time here decided against it and just said - FINE - JUST FLIPPING FINE ~ CHARGE ALL YOU WANT.  I have a hard time believing cooking staff can crank out fresh food on a Saturday night - all night - and suddenly get 'stumped and stupid' not able to wok bean sprouts - and for all the \"less\" effort charge me EXTRA.  I told her, \"I am a cook/chef, you have great food here and I'm impressed.  However if I tell you I want something - and you have it - the reason I cannot order it should be because management won't allow it - not because YOU feel I will be disappointed in my choice.  Am I clear to you on that?  I want to cook tomorrow using my chosen carry out dish ~ Hmmm... quick review, *a vegetable dish that has a large percentage/portion of bean sprouts* - at your $2.00 more pricing for being so wild and rebellious I guess.  I was super ticked off - at this woman telling me what I should or should not order because somehow she telepathically knew what would work for me and what wouldn't - ?  So I sit and wait for 'whatever' and am getting angrier and angrier... Say YES or Say NO - but please DO NOT TELL me what I ordered will taste like crap ~ stupid, stupid and again very stupid thing to do.  I so was having fun and wanting to finally find a home in delicious Chinese Cuisine - this was better than at our little mini China Town Cultural Center by the airport by far.  So finally the carryout food came ~ and I wrote a note on my bill, my phone number and STIFFED the waitstaff and felt GOOD about it - The second waitress was BAD & mean-acting & gruff - pukey. I order this all the time - 1st time punished for it",

    "text": "Okay, other Yelpers are not overly impressed with this place, but I'm ecstatic.  Major bonus because we've actually got an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant in North Phoenix.  The tanks are filled with fresh crustaceans soon to be cooked and devoured.  Caucasians are not a majority when you assess the customer base, and the decor can be called \"clean but dive-ish\".  I love it.  The table cloths used at dinner time seem unnecessary given the rest of the decor.  The portions are plentiful.  The food has lots of flavor.  The chicken with black bean sauce is fantastic and spicy.  The prawns with honey pecans was okay, but a bit too rich.  The prawns are covered with an unusually rich mayonnaise sauce, which although wasn't my favorite, I give them credit for serving something unique.  The chow fun noodles should not be missed.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant.  North Phoenix is blessed to have Nee House in the neighborhood.",

Ate a family meal here too... it was a standard Chinese family meal - soup, veggies, a few meat dishes. It wasn't terrible or gross, nor was it HALLELUJAH! worthy. It was just good.

    "text": "Apparently this place is a hit with the Asian community of Phoenix. Any restaurant that has a body part in the name has got to be tried.    When I first walked in, I was taken back by the mental institution looking decor with the stark white walls and the 1990s tile floor.  Decor deserves an F, but hey, it's Chinese. You never come eat Chinese for the ambiance.  Service was alright. Our deep voiced lady waitress recommended us to get the fillet Mignon cubes which was alright, nothing amazing.  We also tried the sauteed rock cod with baby bok choy which was just alright. It was nice and light though which was nice.  Finally we had the duck since my mother raved about it.  It was under seasoned and lacked any presentation whatsoever.  I mean... OK, I wasn't expecting Picasso or orange sauce to be drizzled on top like art, but come on, throw me a parsley leaf or some lettuce or something rather than just a duck.  Perhaps they have an amazing dinner menu, who knows, but Nee House was Needless to say not as Neelicious as I expected to be.  If this is the best that Phoenix has to offer in authentic Chinese cuisine, I would say it barely passed the test in my eyes.",

As far as Chinese food goes this place ranks up there in my top places to eat.   This is a great relief to the closing of the silver dragon. I know this place has changed hands a couple time but this one is the best of yet and I hope that they stay forever. I always like family run businesses. I like the non corporate attitude of the food and the taste of the food is perfect for my palate.   The fresh fish in the tanks and live lobster look too good and I hope to be able to sit down and order one but for now since I dine alone I will just stick to my favorites.",

The Shanghai Noodles, my friend's favorite, were very dry with no sauce, and definitely no spices added.The Kung Pow Chicken and Mandarin Beef literally had no taste and not even soy sauce or salt and pepper would bring them up to par. We all enjoy spicy food and we found only two chiles between the two dishes, that were definitely not hot the way we like or have had at other Chinese restaurants. The only dish that resembled what we expected were the Walnut Prawns. This place is more expensive than any other Chinese takeout we have used over the years, and not worth the extra money--so you don't always get what you pay for. Our bill at Nee House was $54 [and we even tipped $6 bucks] compared to a recent similar order from Bamboo China, which was $34 and excellent! Last time we will order from here.",

If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.

It seems like every day, a new restaurant is opening with a new twist on some new kind of cuisine.  And don't get me wrong- I love that and am an avid trier of new places. But there are some days when I earn for the simple, straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia. There are some of those places in Chandler and Mesa but I live in North Phoenix and don't always want to make the drive. Well, I was pretty excited to discover Nee House- I love the food there- it's simple and it's always good.  They have a great selection of seafood entrees that puts both my son and myself in heaven.   The decor is simple and unpretentious- I always feel relaxed there and know that I am going to get fed some mouth watering delicious dishes! After this glowing review, why 4 stars instead of 5?  Because of the wait- the place can get pretty packed.  I always feel like I need to get there early to get a table without the wait- too bad the restaurant doesn't offer any \"early bird\" specials!",

Most recently we did take out, and well that took 30 waiting in the lobby after the time they said the food would be ready to actually get the food. When we have sat down, the service is pretty slow and seems to take quite a while to get our food! The food is great and the portions are a good size, but wow, bring your patience!! I hope they read the reviews about their service and step it up!",

The only thing that kept me coming back was the food. They're extremely rude in person AND over the phone. I tried placing a take out order and simply asked what kind of shrimp entrees they had and the lady had an attitude with me because she didn't want to list the few dishes that they carry. Lazy. Very disappointed. I will definitely not be coming back to this restaurant anymore. The Golden Wok and Wang's Express have better customer service, and are close by so I would recommend going there before ever receiving low quality customer service from this dingy little place.",

Over the years we have tried many of the items from sweet and sour to garlic egg plant and I don't recall ever having a bad dish. The service is adequate. They are not overly friendly but they get the job done and get you in and out in a timely manner.  The decor is sparse but they do have some cool fish tanks to look at.",

The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven't had it for at least three days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I'm not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.  I got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.  My husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn't too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn't the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui's used to make it but still this dish was very good.  The Yelp rating is very accurate here.  I'm also feeling a 3.5 based on service, atmosphere and averaging food in.  I will round up my rating to 4 stars because the food is what this thing is about.",

Some years I won't go for a year, another year, I would come a few times a week where the owner used to tell me \"see you tomorrow\"....  I came here for lunch the other day this week and I was looking through the diner menu (as I always order only from dinner menu even during lunch time) as I came earlier than my friend.  I realized I ate everything on the menu. So am I a fan here? I must be.   I like to come here with a group of people as I like to order as many dishes as possible.  I normally start with soup. Seafood soup is my favorite.  My favorite main dish includes rock cod with black bean sauce,  mapo tofu, green vegetables I can't remember the name but they know what I mean (they have pictures on the menu), singapore noodle, to name a few.  For dinner, I would like to ask them to cook fish (the whole fish), lobsters, and if we make reservation two weeks in advance, I would like to order Shaoxing wine (). They don't normally keep a bottle but when we requested, they orddered bottles for us.  Warm shaoxing shu with sliced ginger goes well with the food they serve...  They also have special menu during Chinese New Years, as well as just sometimes. I learned how to say and read lot of dishes name in Chinese from this restaurant.    Service may be on and off but quuality of food is always consistent. The most authentic Chinese food in North Phoenix.  How could I say that? Because I had Chinese food in China.",

Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. I'm stil partial to the Ginger beef, however.",

    "text": "This is your classic zero-ambiance Chinese joint.  Reminds me a lot of places that you find in Chinatown in NYC or Boston.  The good news is that cost-cutting on the dining room floor translates into an investment in the food.  Try the cod with ginger sauce.  I normally will gloss right over this type of selection on a typical Chinese menu, but my friend suggested that I try this, and he was spot on.  The cod is cut into these elongated cakes, and the white sauce has the slight peppery flavor of ginger along with a mildly sweet/salty velvety touch.  Throw in the sauteed baby bok choy, and you have a dish that excels.  The shrimp with lobster sauce is just as delicious, as this is a great alternative to the typical Sesame Chicken or Orange Beef that you might order yourself.    Step out of the box a bit with this restaurant.  A dead giveway to its authenticity is the packed round of 10 that you will find every weekend, populated chiefly by Asian diners.  There is a secret Chinese menu here, too, so bring someone who speaks the lingo if you want to access things like whole roasted fish!",

If you are black, white, or Hispanic they will most certainly say things about you in their own language. They speak Chinese and Vietnamese. I went with a good friend of mine who is Vietnamese and they were translating all the stuff they were saying about customers in their respective language. The head lady there is one of the most unpleasant people to do business with. She's rude, grouchy, and borderline disrespectful.         Conversely, the food there is beyond authentic. I'm a foodie and I know good food. It's quality and delicious. Certain dishes you will not find anywhere else. It is simply a hole in the wall with extraordinary food. Walnut shrimp, PuPu platter, hot and sour soup, egg rolls, low mein , and of course the live seafood. It tough to give my money to to these people because the service is so substandard but those food is epic.   As long as you know all this info going in, your much better off in terms of managing expectations.",

I wish I could say I am exaggerating, but this really topped every bad experience I've ever had in the past. The entire experience was bad, from beginning to end. We came in for a Thanksgiving meal, and the hour we endured ruined the entire holiday.  The service here was beyond terrible. We were 1 of 3 tables being served, so it wasn't busy at all - but we were treated like they had a full house and a line of people waiting out the door.   It all began when we weren't greeted. The woman hurriedly walked up to us and looked at us as if we came in to ask a question. I said \"two please,\" and she replied \"two what?\" I repeated myself \"Two, for here, please.\" And then the fun began....  It took us about 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waiter/owner. When we asked for a coke and diet coke, he angrily took our teacups away and returned with our sodas about 10 minutes later. I'm not sure what we did to tick him off, but he sure was upset that we came in.  When we inquired about the price of crab, he told us \"Ummmm, ummmmmmmmm, $45.00. Some are bigger some are smaller,\" and very quickly walked away, said something to the lady working there and walked in the back. Finally he came back and took our order. We ordered in Chinese, he confirmed it in English.  The food certainly didn't take long to arrive - so much so that the paper wrapped chicken was still partially raw in the center, and the peppered beef was uncooked halfway through. The dishes themselves were presentable, but very, very small and pricey for a typical Chinese joint. We never complained about the raw food. The owner added an additional dish about 5 minutes after we began to eat. He became very upset with us when we told them we didn't order it and asked him to take it back. We weren't rude about the mistake with the additional dish, but he quickly got an attitude with us and began to argue with us about the dish and wanted us to take responsibility for it.   He refused to serve us the for remainder of the meal and had the other lady working there give us our check. We certainly won't be returning, and I hope that anyone else who braves this establishment has a better experience than we did.",

My husband and I decided to stop here for dinner tonight and I'm so glad we did.  What a little gem this place is!  Its a small restaurant in a strip mall, but the food more than compensated for the ambiance.  We tried their General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and garlic Szechuan green beans.  The spicy chicken was so tender, and had a nice light batter on it.  The beef was even more tender, if that's even possible.  We loved the green beans too, and enjoyed the sauce which was a nice combination of spice and sweet garlic.  We got there before 6pm and the tables filled up pretty quickly after we got there.  They do an amazing job on takeout orders too, as I noticed there was a steady stream of people heading out the door with their bagged up food.  I'll definitely be back, and see some takeout food in my future too!",

More interesting were the tanks on the back wall. One was empty. Crabs were in one, lobsters in another, and healthy looking fish in the third. Seasonal prices are by the pound, not per item. A 2 1/2 pound at $16 and change is going to run just over $40. As lively as they look, I just might splurge! Some other reviews have commented on poor service.  This was not my experience at all. Both the waiter and waitress were attentive, efficient, and polite. He checked back to make sure I had everything I needed. I was very satisfied. Their menu is extensive and reasonably priced.  This also applies to the lunch menu which includes your choice of soup (sweet/sour), an egg roll, rice (white or fried), and your entree. As I like seafood, I chose shrimp and eggplant Szechuan style (see pic). It had a chili pepper by it indicating the dish was hot. My only complaint is the dish was too mild to deserve that chili. However, it was very flavorful. The hot and sour soup was solid, but not extraordinary.  Would I come back again? Yes. And I would bring my friends.",

The food quality has been excellent. Personally, I go for their fried rice and their soups, but everything on the menu is pretty damn good, as far as I can tell.  Prices were decent, and the staff were pretty attentive with refills and such. Then again, I always try to come on the off hours. If you make a reservation in advance, it works wonders!

It cleaned my nose right out (spicy). It was derived very fast, too. My colleague enjoyed his lunch, too.   You can get fresh fish, lobster, crab, etc as they have them there! Prices are posted on the wall no no surprises.   The waitress was not that sensitive to the fact we were working gents on lunch break so she was about as laid back as the senior citizens that were dining in at the same time we were.

As I read most of the comments for this restaurant or any other restaurant in general, people love to rant about how this was bad, or the service was horrible.....there was one that mentioned the food had a specific temperature when it came out. Unbelievable how people can tell how hot or cold the food is to a specific degree! I LOVE that some mouths come with a thermometer!!!  What if I stuck my....nevermind!!  As of now, Nee House keeps me content when I am craving Chinese food and missing San Francisco.    Everyone is trying the \"american version\" of Chinese food.    Being a foodie......a few things to learn about Chinese restaurants.  1.  There really isn't anything as orange chicken, or pineapple chicken, etc...You ain't gonna find none of this shit in Asia! Try Panda Express if you want good orange chicken! 2.  Chinese restaurants will not have the service you will find at a 3 Michelin rated restaurant unless you're dining at Tommy Toy's in San Francisco.  The attitude and rudeness comes with the territory.  Anyone ever go for soul food?  Same attitude, what's the difference?? Tough it up, bitches!  Besides, the food tastes better with attitude. 3. Reality check.....WE LIVE IN PHOENIX!!!!  You want Chinese food, this is it!  Nee House......try:  *Beef Chow Fun.....as good as it gets in Hong Kong, NY, SF, or any major city with a Chinatown. *A-Vegetable......spicy, this dish's origin is from Taiwan. Very seasonal. I was surprised they have this dish year round here.  You can't even find that in the Bay Area year round.   * Fried Pork spareribs in salt-spicy.....a bit greasy, but pretty authentic.",

We choose MongolianBeef and Orange Chicken. It came with fried wonton, fried shrimp and foiled wrapped chicken. The wonton was soggy, the chicken thing looked too weird to eat and this little turnover was supposed to be the fried shrimp??   The Mongolian Beef was cold but pretty good. Unfortunately the Orange Flavor Chicken was flavorless. The crust fell off each piece of chicken, also. What can I say about the four sad little egg rolls?  They've never ever been this small!

After all , there are more ethnic Chinese per capita living in San Francisco than anywhere in the world except Hong Kong. And I enjoy Cantonese as opposed to the other styles like Hunan or Mandarin.   Having lived in San Francisco for much of my life and having spent time in Chinese I can spot authenticity pretty easily. The menu I saw online along with whatever pictures I get review helped me in my decision to check it out.   My verdict: Pretty good but it's not in the same league as San Francisco: I rate it 7/10. The Wor Wonton Soup was good, though it was lacking the typical veggies and shrimp I come to expect Yes, there were wontons but no veggies of any substance I can recall, and beef, which is typically NOT srved in this soup. But it was tasty.   Mt friend and I shared the spicy/salty squid which was actually QUITE good and would recommend. We also had the snow pea leaves as a main veggie dish and while overpriced,  was excellent. We also shared  chicken pan fried noddles which were just \"okay.\" Skimpy on veggies and chicken, taste was a 6/10 though the noodles were fried perfectly.   Would I recommend? I suppose,  but with the expectation that if you are looking for a great, authentic cantonese style restaurant similar to what you might get in San Francisco, Oakland or much of Los Angeles or Vancouver. Will I return? Probably.",

I think the best part of the meal was the fried rice with shrimp and BBQ pork. I am still puzzled why so many people rave about the walnut shrimp. It is covered in a mayonnaise sauce that takes away any crispiness that should have been there. The garlic chicken was pretty decent, but the sweet and sour fish my dad ordered was sub par. The sauce was good but it seemed to be missing the fish. It was more like fried breading. They also feature Kirin and Kirin Light  beer on the menu, but don't ask for it. They don't actually have it in house. This place is not worth a repeat visit.",

    "text": "The food from this place reminds me of home. I'm mostly Taiwanese, a little island off of China, but the food here has the taste of Hong Kong with a few American favorites for the locals such as the classic mongolian beef or the citrus-y orange chicken.   I personally go for a mix of both. When I'm feeling more cultural, I'll grab some lobster with garlic, or even some chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (warning, expect this dish to be bitter, that is a valued taste in most Chinese cuisines).  Today, I grabbed some take out of the mongolian beef for myself with fried rice and egg roll, and the girlfriend at home got the chicken lo mein with fried rice and egg roll.  Dude, just the egg roll alone and a few bites out of the entree and you are FULL. Seriously, their portions are huge.   Expect leftovers and merry moments later in the day to finish your food.  Caveat: Don't expect the service to be very kind. When going to truly authentic Chinese places, do not expect the customer service standards of that of even a TGIF. The Chinese are very \"to the point\" when it comes to food. You go in, sit down, say hello, order some food, pay your bill, get out. Don't make chit chat.",

We ordered 2 lunch specials(orange chicken and eggplant) and salt & pepper deep fried shrimp. The lunch specials came with a soup, we got the hot and sour soup. It was pretty good! The flavor was perfect and the broth was just thick enough. The lunch entrees were just mediocre, BUT the shrimp dish was amazing! We loved it. The jalapenos, onions and chives were a great touch. Make sure you dig inside those heads lol I think IF we came back, we would try more dishes on the dinner menu - it seems like that's where it's at.",

    "text": "My Family (parents, cousin and his wife, my boyfriend and his mom) all went to this restaurant last night. It was by far the worst service we have ever had. We have been coming to this location for years even when it was called yummy China and my parents were friends with the previous owners. We love authentic places but after last night we don't know if we will ever be back. Our waitress was beyond words of rude. We ordered the hot sour soup for the table and only wanted 1 large bowl because we didn't want a lot since we also ordered pot stickers and the pork egg rolls. She demanded we get a bowl and a half because she wasn't listening that not everyone was going to eat it. She was so angry and when we received the soup she slammed the bowls Down, we asked to serve it ourselves and she wouldn't listen and kept doing it herself on purpose to show it only served a certain amount but didn't realize we only wanted a half cup each not a full! Next we ordered our 7 full sized meals (which we could of easily ordered half the amount and shared) and when we received one of the dishes we told the owner we did not like it and we would like to exchange it for a different noodle dish since the one we ordered was not as expected (it's not like we decided to take it off the bill). She wasn't happy but did accommodate the request. Then the server comes over to me and yells at me like I was a child in front of everyone at my table and the restaurant saying \"you can't just tell the cook you don't like something did you say that? You can't return it.\" and I was like \"excuse me? The dish wasn't what I expected and I did not like it. I'm confused on what you are doing here?\" she walked off, didn't answer me, and NEVER ONCE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE, not once! The boy buzzer filled all our waters, grabbed us an extra rice since we only got 1 for the entire table (which we were out of right away), and brought boxes after we were finished. Here we are- taking my cousin and his wife to our favorite place since she just moved here from Hawaii with my cousin, and they witnessed this disaster. SOOO disappointing as I have worked in restaurants and different establishments with all different titles for years and would never treat a customer with such disrespect. Giving a one star only for the food, and busser.",

I can't put my finger on it: Is it the staff who seem grudging, or the lighting which lacks brightness, or perhaps just vibes from the building or the brooding fishtanks that line the walls (Why do they seem so unhappy?) Whatever, I go and enjoy the food--although often having salt hangover later--but still feel uncomfortable. I will commend the salt and pepper pork chops and the hot and sour soup. The eggplant dishes are among my favorites.",

    "text": "I'm hesitant to review Nee House because I pretty much just don't want anyone else to know about it, but this place is the best for Chinese food in the Valley and that alone is something every decent citizen deserves to know.  Yes, the service isn't the greatest, but some advice to diners going out expecting a thorough, smiley staff: Don't go to a Chinese restaurant.  It's all about the food here and that is why Nee House gets 5 stars in my book.  Bear with me as I leave the actual ordering of food to the real pros in my family, but there is a handful of dishes that are musts.  The Westlake Soup is a great, clean way to start off the meal and makes you feel good about yourself before indulging in the greasy amazingness that follows. As far as meat goes, the HK Style/Peking/Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs are deliciously sauced and have the right amount of meaty bite to go with it.  The Peking Duck is a go-to, as well. Tender pieces of duck with crispy skin served with hoison sauce, green onions, shrimp chips and slightly-sweet, soft buns (ohhh yeah) to wrap it all up in.  I'm a big fan of their Crispy, House-Fried Noodles served with a plethora of meats, seafood and bok choy. They make a pretty good steamed fish (it's served whole, with a head- so don't freak out) if you're being health conscious. It's served in a brothy, soy-saucey, gingery, scallionish sauce and is clean and simple.  And lastly, if you are to eat ONE thing here, maybe even one last thing for your entire lifetime, let it be the Kowloon Style Crab..unless you're allergic to shellfish or something. It's a whole crab, served fried and covered in a ton of crispy garlic and jalapenos. The crab shell has a little layer of deep-fried goodness and I can eat the garlic straight up alone or on top of plain rice.  Yep, it's that good, and yep, I'm that disgusting.  If you're a fan of the basic sweet and sour chicken...fried rice...egg rolls...etc. etc., I'm sure that stuff is good here, but I dare you to venture out of the boring and try some more authentic dishes.  The best way to dine here is to come with a big group and get a lot of different things to try, authentically Family Style!  And if you don't like it, then whatever, I hear there's another Chinese restaurant down the street that serves up crappy basics that might be more to your liking.",

    "text": "After opening all our gifts and eating a big Christmas lunch the family decided they wanted some dinner.  Well, we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers, and since we were at my mom's, there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks, which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!  Nee House is near my folks, so we called up and placed an order to go.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready...yikes!  My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really, really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse, and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).  When they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait....and well, it did!  We got the hot & sour soup as well as the War Wonton, both were excellent, although the hot & sour could have used a bit more heat.  The house fried rice was awesome, cooked perfectly, with lots of meat and it wasn't greasy at all, which is very unusual for fried rice.  We also got mu shu pork (this was the best I have ever had) and some sesame chicken.  It was breaded, but it wasn't greasy at all, and the sauce was just sweet enough, but not overpowering.  We had ordered some crab puffs, and they were good, but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce, which would have made them that much better.  Overall, except for the long wait, we found Nee house to be really good.  My dad brought home a menu for us to look at, and it has one of the most expansive menus I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant, including a lot of seafood dishes.  My dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix...and I have a feeling he will be going back again soon.",

I was a bit suprised to find a place like this next to an Ace hardware in a strip mall, but as luck would have it I walked in and was impressed.  Their menu is some Americanized Chinese fare but hidden in there are some very Chinese dishes harking from Cantonese and Schezuan roots.  The also offer some northern dishes like Peking duck (a must have in Oakland's Chinatown).   I would absolutely eat here again.  I hope this little gem stays in business to service my Peking duck cravings for many years to come.",

    "text": "If you're looking for good, authentic chinese food then this place is one of my favorites in Phoenix.  If you're more into westernized chinese food, go to Panda Express.  If you're looking for an upscale place or are more interested in great service, then this place isn't for you.   It is a typical home-style authentic chinese restaurant, and one of the best ones for authentic chinese food in Phoenix.  It has been here for a few years and we order here regularly.  The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China (which was a pretty bad place) and the food has been consistently good.  As others here mentioned, order from the chinese menu, not the western menu.  We've tried pretty much  the entire menu and haven't found too much that we don't like.  The cook sometimes comes out and chats with you - he will make you something specific or special if you ask for it.  They do seafood (lobster, crab, shrimps) really well; their house chow mein (dry style) is HK authentic; their beef chow fun and chicken and salt fish fried rice are some of our favorite dishes. Price-wise, it's reasonable for the quality.  The place is fairly clean for a chinese restaurant.  Service wise - well, it's a chinese restaurant - 'nuff said.  If the service will bother you, order take-out instead.     Silver Dragon used to be our go-to restaurant for authentic chinese food until it closed down.  This place is better, so we don't miss Silver Dragon.",

Albeit we are a far stretch from Hop Kee or Big Wong in Chinatown this place does not dissapoint. They have the usual suspects here, even enough to satisfy the PF Changs crowd. Why people spend there greeny's at changs just blows me away!   If you love eggplant they do a great job with the garlic eggplant dish. The geoduk clam is exceptional. If you have to ask....google it. Im sure you could find this gastropod online. It is briny, Sweet, oceanic and more tender than you might expect. Positively great!! The pea leaf is not on the menu and it is fantastic. The cold jellyfish is a must.   Crab is fantastic and fresh. Choose your own Lobster for the Lobster in Black bean sauce. This is as close to chinatown as I have found. They are even raosting duck and serving it with multi colored rice chips; Something I have not seen since leaving NYC.   WARNING! This is a family run establishment and the family on the floor is slow and moody. However, the owner and chef is extremely nice and will create you a special dish; or just ask for him to make you anything he can dream up and he usually will.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a late lunch. When I walked in around 2:15 pm there was no one in sight, neither a fellow customer or staff. After a few moments a nice lady came out from the back and instructed me to take a seat. It appeared they were getting ready to sit down for either a late lunch or early family dinner. Many of tables had linen on them, with the remainder still uncovered from lunch. The place was very clean and simple, nothing awe inspiring, but I wasn't here for the decor but the food.   And the food was outstanding! I've eaten Chinese all over this country, especially in NY and Chicago. Unfortunately the Chinese food in Phoenix has been very disappointing so far. But today was about to end all of the negative experiences I've had so far. Ordered spicy shrimp and eggplant with fried rice, egg roll and hot and sour soup from the lunch menu.   My food arrived hot! The egg roll was crispy and very tasty. My hot and sour soup was good but nothing I haven't had before. But when my lunch plate arrived it was a feast for my eyes. The food was hot from the wok, seriously hot. The fried rice was the best I've ever had. A short grained rice that was not greasy but entente. The eggplant was to die for. Sweet, tender and flavorful in a dark sauce surrounded by a bountiful amount of wonderful shrimp. I savored each and every bite. I was so happy the food was hot as it forced me to eat slowly and savor each and every bite. I actually went home and dreamed about this meal, wanting to return the next day and have it again. I litterally ate every last grain of rice off of my plate. Heck I wanted to pick it up and lick it, it was that good.   I definitely can't wait to go back for either lunch or dinner and try more of there great food. And by the way, after reading about the grumpy family I didn't find them unpleasant at all, in fact they were very nice.",

Regulars know NOT to expect the servers to accommodate their customers with any regularity.  If you want clarification on a menu item, be sure to take your Chinese/English dictionary.  If you want to substitute an item, learn the art of oral argument. If you need more water or tea, get used to waiting.  If they change a dish from the menu, you'll find out when it is served.  If they decide to clean the fish tank while you're eating,  good luck digesting your good,  Get the picture?  Over the years, we've put up with a lot but today, one of the younger waitresses was particularly rude & insulting even though we've known her for years.  I suggested that we leave but my wife insisted we stay and focus on the food and not the horrible service.  So if you go, please heed our warning and expect little to no service.  Or consider another Chinese restaurant, as we shall do from this day forward...    George & Son has exceptional service and great food.

Heck, my wife and I have sampled the Chinese cultural district as well, and in our opinion, the Nee House betters all restaurants there as well.    The Nee House has the best General Tso's chicken in the region, with a little twist (I think it's ginger, but i'm not certain) that sets it apart form its competition.  The General Tso's rivals its competition from the west coast and east coast.  The noodles are fantastic, with fresh ingredients and vegetables, and the eggplant and salt-n-pepper shrimp are outstanding.  The only reason i didn't give The Nee House 5 stars (and I admit, I'm being picky) is because they do not have a dish I've been looking for in the entire Phoenix metro-area, but admittedly the Nee House does not  focus on Sichuan-style dishes (the dish i'm looking for is Sichuan Spicy Cold Chicken Noodles, which i fell in love with while living in the Bay area, but which is impossible to find in the Phoenix-metro area).  If you want authentic, delicious, Chinese food, make sure you give the Nee House a try.",

I lived for two years in South China, and it's a serious treat to find a place with good food from there.   Even stuff like their pu-pu platter is head and shoulders above anything else I've had in the valley, just because of the superior ingredients and cooking. The beef skewers are tender, succulent pieces of quality meat. The \"chicken in paper\" wrapped in foil is juicy and savory in that special Cantonese way. Their char siu is tender and delicious. Nothing is sickly sweet or soaked in oil.   I want to eat everything on the menu. This place really is a gem.

Waitress- \"We have 14.99 special for lobster today\" Us - \"Really?? wow, for the whole lobster??\" W- \"Yes, whole lobster just 14.99\" Us - \"Great we will order one lobster\"  The meal arrives we eat and finish, everything was satisfactory till the horror of the check arrives. $14.99 a LB (4lb lobster you do the math). Us- \"I think there is a mistake, didn't you say it was 14.99 for the whole lobster?\" W- \"Yes whole lobster 14.99\" Us - \"I think you may have messed up on the check\"  waitress looks at check, goes to talk to manager, then comes back W- \"No i say 14.99 a lb\" Us - \"but you just said 14.99 for the WHOLE lobster\" W- \"No i say 14.99 for whole lobster a lb\" Us- *sigh*  We know they are trying to rip us off now, but we went with guests and don't want to make a scene, so we belly up 14.99 a lb for a 4lb lobster, and we also ordered 4 other dishes. yeah.....  Thanks Nee house for being dishonest..  If you are going to go, make sure you clarify and if you can record what the waitress says before ordering. or just avoid the daily special on lobster/sea food.   -Other times i have come to nee house it has been fine, so food is okay, not great and def not the best. So decent chinese food here. Terrible service and not willing to own up for their own mistake, thats here.",

House special pan fried noodles can with perfectly cooked baby bok choy, carrots, chicken (I hear they only use white meat chicken), beef and shrimp... BUT DEM NOODLES?? Crunchy on the outside, soft and noodles on the inside. Literally delicious.  My absolute favorite today though, and I realize how silly this might sound, was the hot and sour soup. So delicious!! In fairness, I've been sick for the last few weeks and haven't been tasting flavor in anything... but this stuff was \"lick-the-bowl\" good.  One day I'm going to go back and try the Lobster pan fried noodles!!! They have live lobster waiting. DROOL!!  I didn't give five stars today because i was slightly disappointed in the dining room and tables. We ordered dishes to share and the tables were so small that it was not super comfortable. I also don't love when there's and entire restaurant open and they pack everyone right next to each other. Spread people out let them breathe!!  We will go back. We will enjoy. We will try more!!",

    "text": "I know this restaurant has been around for quite awhile, but I've just recently discovered this hidden gem.  First of all, they have live lobsters, dungeon ness crabs, and fishes everyday of the week. The fact this restaurant has 4 fish tanks to hold all these freshness is a good indicator that their seafood dishes will be DELICIOUS. Let's cut straight to the food. House Special Lobster was absolutely yummy.  The lobster weights roughy 3+ lbs making the cost of this dish comes to about $77. If you are a lobster fanatic like me, it's totally worth eating ramen noodles for a week to save the money to splurge on this heavenly lobster. There are a few variations your lobster can be prepared. Look at the description on the menu to find the best fit for your taste. Next, we have the Peking Duck. I'm used to having a little meat on the crispy duck skin, but if you are a diehard,  Peking duck fan, then the crispy skin shouldn't have any meat to it. This restaurant prepared their Peking duck the old school way, with very meat still attached to the duck skin. Lastly, we have your typical snow pea leaves sauteed with garlic. The dish tasted super fresh. The staff here is  your typical meet your needs kind of crew. My overall score in the food is 9, and service is 7. A must visit restaurant if you love eating lobster as much as I do. Until next time, let's do the lobsta dance.",

Highly recommend the mandarin pork chops! If you're from northern China like me, these taste like home.   Also recommend the eggplant, seafood hot pot, hot and sour soup, Peking duck, and fried rice. All delicious, all authentic. Everything is family style, portions are generous.  The decor is plain, and like other reviews mentioned there's not much of an ambience. But that's not what this place is about.   Come for the food and stay for the food. It's a simple dining experience that will satisfy any Chinese food craving. Everything else is secondary. Service is efficient and gets food to your table in a timely manner. With flavors like these I really couldn't ask for more.   The restaurant is family owned and run and they are some of the nicest, hardest working people I have met.   Bottom line: If you're a diehard fan of quality, authentic Chinese food and don't mind the lack of window dressing, this place will keep you coming back.",

The Squid dish was slightly rubbery with too many onions.  The flavor was good though.  People continued to pour in for dinner.  This is an authentic Chinese dining with full fish tanks.

We ordered the pork egg rolls, the crab rangoon, chicken pan fried noodles, salt & pepper squid and beef with oyster sauce. The good: my husband loved the squid. The bad: everything else. I ended up using the rice to eat my leftovers from somewhere else.  The first misstep was the egg rolls. They were the oddest egg rolls I have ever eaten. The pork tasted like some type of processed pork you'd get in a grocery store deli. The crab rangoon were overly fishy and soggy. The chicken and beef were velveted to the point that they both almost tasted mushy. The worst part is that this all added up to $56 and will be going in the trash.",

Been here a few times and also have done take out.  Recently ordered the Young Chow Fried Rice and the House Special Chow Mein with the Hong Kong Style Noodles. Both dishes were prepared very well and very good authentic Chinese style.  This Chinese Restaurant serves good old style authentic Cantonese Style dishes and all the dishes we have had have been prepared as good as the better Chinese Restaurants around.   The staff, workers and owners are not the friendliest people and when they see other Asians have to ask so many questions to see if they know you or your family. That's okay, they are just the old style Chinese people and are interested in if in some way they may know your family or someone in your family.   The prices that were charged did not match what was on line for the 2 items that was ordered. Don't know if the website I looked at needs to be updated.   Overall, good food and will come back again",

    "text": "Stopped by Nee House for lunch the other day right before 3pm after reading reviews on yelp.  They have a lot of fish tanks with live seafood that you can order, which I thought was pretty impressive.  Lunch, however, wasn't as impressive.  The lunch menu is very small.  I normally go for a sesame or house special chicken, neither of which were on the lunch menu (and it clearly says no substitutions), so I settled for orange chicken.  Almost all of the lunch prices are $6.99, with a few options being $7.99.  For this price, you get a cup of soup (choice of egg drop or hot and sour, which I was glad for), your entree, white or fried rice, and a spring roll.    The hot and sour soup smelled incredible, but sadly didn't live up to its scent.  I added some salt, but it didn't really help it out.  This being said, it's much better than almost all other hot and sour soups I've had around here.  The orange chicken was white meat and somewhat dry.  The sauce was okay, not too much flavor there either.  The spring roll wasn't bad.    A gentleman came in after me and ordered fried rice with his meal.  After he ordered, the staff started streaming out of the kitchen to eat a family-style lunch at one of the large corner tables, bringing out their own plates of rice for themselves.  When the gentleman received his food, he let the guy know that he had ordered fried rice, but they had given him steamed.  The older woman that had been taking care of us then told him that they were 'out' of fried rice.  Total crap, am I right?  If he ordered it and it was fine then, why isn't it now?  It soon became clear when the dishwasher came out with his own plate full of fried rice to eat at the corner table with the other staff.  I almost couldn't believe it.  The gentleman didn't catch this however, so he didn't complain.  I felt bad for him.  They obviously don't care too much about it, since they didn't offer to cook him a side of it.  Oh well.  Based on the food, I won't be coming back.  My search for good chinese food in the valley continues.",

He didn't understand the serving style when it comes to \"family style\" and one dish at a time.  Once he tasted the food, it was all over and he was a fan.  My whole family just loves this place.  My sisters insist on going here when they are in town.  Some of the favorites are:  Sweet and Sour Chicken, Orange Chicken. Walnut Chicken. Kung Pao Beef, Fried Rice, Salt and Pepper Shrimp...and the list goes on.    Now, this is not the most ideal date spot because ambiance isn't important to this family owned restaurant.  Most of the staff speak English as their second language but certainly understand what you want.  This is a family owned restaurant with the dad in the kitchen all the time.  Their daughters work hard as servers and can really make your dining experience more enjoyable if you engage them in conversation.  We eat there so much they recognize us and could probably place our order without us saying a word.  Their prices are reasonable.  The food is tasty.  Overall, A+.",

    "text": "I love this Chinese restaurant. Being raised in a Cantonese household, I would claim myself to have quite a high standard for Chinese food as we eat pretty much every variety of Cantonese dieshes.  From the outside you would never guess it's a Chinese restaurant as it doesn't have any Chinese characters on the sign. All too many times, most of the so-called \"Chinese\" restaurants in Phoenix are way too Americanized so I hesitated when I first saw this restaurant. However, I found out about this restaurant from the Phoenix Asian newspapers and decided to give it a shot.  Inside, it's definitely not the best looking restaurant around, but it is a decent setting. One thing you'll notice about this restaurant, which is very much like some of the good LA chinese restaurants is that they highlight their signature dishes on the wall via nice full colored images.  The service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese, so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too, had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.  The menu has the trademark selection of classic Hong Kong Style menu items, easy to read menu with pictures and both English/Chinese writing. Tons of clay pot items, meats, fish, soup, stir fry items. I ordered the walnut shrimp w/ mayo, beef chow fun, Salted Fish with chicken fried rice. Those are usually my favorite dishes to order at any of the restaurants to test their culinary skills. For people who know a little about Cantonese cooking, the importance of the WOK determines if the food is good or not. Usually if the restaurant has a powerful enough stove with a good quality wok, you can tell the difference in the taste of the food.  When I got the items, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The food was seasoned just right, not too salty. The Walnut Shrimp was pretty decent size, the sauce was not too thick and not too sweet, just right. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp as it had that nice texture to it.  The beef chow fun was a pretty good dish. Beef could've been a bit more \"fluffy\", but still pretty moist compared other places in Phoenix. It was a pretty generous amount. The seasoning on the noodle and beef was a little light for my taste, but still pretty good as the noodles were not too soft and not too tough.  The salted fish rice was a very big plate. The salted fish was cut just small enough and the shreds of chicken was perfect compliment to the dish. This was among my favorite dish.  Back to the WOK thing, you can tell this place had some really good WOK action cause all the food came out real hot, and the texture of the food had all of the fresh \"STIR FRY\" element to it that you can't get from a regular pan.   I've been back many times and definitely very satisfied. I'd probably caution any folks reading this review is that it is still not at the level of Hong Kong or LA, etc, but for Phoenix, it outperforms its competition by a long shot.",

Slow and seemed like we were deliberately being ignored which is odd because we are Chinese.  I was thrilled to see Cantonese pan fried noodles on the menu, we ordered the shrimp version, barely enough to serve 2 people.  The stir fried A Choy with fermented tofu was good, different as I had never had A choy before.

    "text": "Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, it's hard finding decent tasting authentic Chinese food in the valley. Nee House definitely provides that authenticity. While the prices are a little bit on the steeper end (12-15 per entree), the expensive price is made up for through the quality of the food.  I always get the Beef chow fun and sweet and sour fish fillet because they've been my favorite dishes ever since I was a kid. However I know I should expand my options because my family always orders more than just those dishes. Nee House provides great tasting food and never disappoints whenever I return.   I'll definitely expand my choices and order other dishes next time.",

Fresh tanks full of lobsters, Dungeness crabs, and tilapia fish.  You can have them prepared in a handful of ways.    Special occasions we order lobsters in the house special sauce - it's amazing!  Like finger licking good!  On the regular we get the House Special Pan Fried boodles, thin pan fried boddles in a brown sauce topped with shrimp, beef, chicken, ginger, carrots and baby bok choy.  Those skinny noodles are such a good textural experience for your taste buds.  Salt & pepper pork chops!  Lightly battered bone in pork chops fried crispy and then tossed with scallions, salt and jalapenos.  If you order one thing - you order this!  Orange beef / orange chicken is your standard affair but really tasty.  Fried rice is the best rice in Arizona!  I think they use bacon grease or some type of magical unicorn spice on their fries rice.  I see a lot of complaints about customer services, we've had no issues.  They are always friendly and polite but no, they don't go out of the way to charm the socks off of you, but I don't care, I don't need them to hold my hand during my dinner.  I just need the to keep my water filled, my food hot and fresh, my check ready when we are done and they NEVER fail to deliver here.",

The online menu is misleading as they have a large selection of wonderful Chinese food.   We ordered today for lunch orange chicken lunch special. The food came out nice and hot with a sweet tangy sauce the chicken well cooked tender and juicy. The dish had an egg roll and soup which choice of fried rice or white rice.  The kids got these.   We also got Beef Chow Fun, Garlic with Snow pea leaf, Salt and pepper pork chops, and Walnut shrimp.  The food was fantastic. The pork chops come out mouth watering hot. It has a bite from the jalapeno slices and just the right amount of salt.  The Chow fun is a tasty flat rice noodle dish that comes with either beef, shrimp or chicken. The noodles are cooked well and seasoned for deliciousness.  The snow pea leaf came out warm and in that rich green color. It had that nice salty garlic flavor and crunchy texture. The walnut shrimps were not overcooked and like eating candy.   The bathroom was okay. Nothing malodorous.  Service was so-so typical of great Chinese restaurants.   We have been going here for years.",

The food is undoubtedly fresh and I have seen some of my foodie physician friends over there ..enjoying the food. Also it is relatively close to home and affordable ( except when it comes to crustaceans). The Ambience sucks, but then again, that keeps the overheads and prices low.

Its a bit more on the expensive side for Chinese food (but you have to understand that I usually demand cheap good eats), but overall I think the food is worth the slight premium.  Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside.    I recommend the French style beef cubes, snow pea leaves, and walnut shrimp.  But really most dishes are delicious.  The decor is not super impressive, but clean.  And the service is a bit lackluster, but the food is what you go for and the food is good.  Happy eating!",

The owner is usually waiting tables and has a horrible attitude.  What can I say though, their food is probably the best around the area.  I'm done dining in there cause I can't stand their rudeness.  I usually just get the food to go.

I remember fried rice at China Doll from my very early days.  Nee House's fried rice is probably the best fried rice I've ever had.   My dad is from Canton, China, and he favors the salted fish and chicken fried rice. While I love that, I have to disagree and go with the crab and dried scallop fried rice.  It is nice though to always get both & have a bit of each.  If you're eating in, they also have live seafood tanks so definitely don't ignore those.  Most of the time though, whenever I'm within stopping distance, I'm calling in fried rice orders and grabbing an order (or two) of each to bring back home to php and my family.",

Come for the food only but beware the service is always horrible from the older Chinese waitress with the glasses. This woman does not know or care about the meaning of customer service and being friendly and attentive.  Always very argumentative when asking for something and condescending to us and in my observation with other customers with a sour face. I recently ordered takeout with value of over $120 and asked for extra gravy on a particular dish. This same waitress taking my phone order said it will cost me $2.00 more. They just received a nice order and now she's being cheap and has the gall to ask for $2 which I declined.  No tip for them. They don't value and appreciate loyal customers. We need more good Chinese restaurants in this part of town to give them competition and teach them not to take customers for granted. If this restaurant was in San Francisco the customers wouldn't take this poor attitude and take their business elsewhere.  Unfortunately with popular Chinese restaurants in general they know people come for the food and don't care one iota about being nice and respectful to the customer since they figure there will be customers still coming.",

(They forgot to even give to me) Then I asked for chowmein with no vegetables and they brought me chowmein with onions. At this point I was very upset due to the fact that she just dropped off our meals and didn't come back to check on us. When she came back it was because she finally heard us calling after her and I told her my order was wrong and I did not want a new one, I just wanted it off the bill. She didn't say anything and left but came back with a younger fat boy and had him tell me that there's no onions in my food WHEN THERE CLEARLY WAS. He also had the nerve to be more careful when ordering when I thought what I had order was pretty specific. I was so upset that instead of offering me a different plate or something they came to tell me that I was wrong not them. I told him to stoping being rude and that I'm not paying for the wrong meal.

Crystal Shrimp Chinese mushrooms and mixed vegetables Spicy pork chops Roasted duck Chicken corn soup Westlake soup Sauteed fish with tofu and veggies  And hats off to whoever makes the Tea decisions there... some of the finest jasmine green tea around! :)",

Time and time goes by, I noticed their customer services are bad, the owner daughter, son and their mom.  The son usual sits at the corner playing his phone and careless for customer service, the daughter always have a black face and throw a fit when we request for something, and their mom, I ordered Take out, sweet and sour Pork chop, bakchoy with black mushroom, and assorted seafood soup, I asked for some white peppers and some red vinegar in a container,  she walks around to service other customers as she walks back, I ask for it again, she went to get red vinegar but she didn't get white peppers,  so I asked for it then she told me, white peppers  are right over there, help yourself,  I went and try to get some white peppers,  there were no container there, as she walk away, she mumbles,  you think you're a king or something,  everything need to get for you.  This is an unnecessary call and it is a very poor customer service.   I told one of the staff there, to help me get a to go container,  I helped myself for some white peppers and i told the staff, I am not going to come back anymore and so are my family,  we will not return for their poor customer services.  Last thing, the sweet and sour porchop were over fried, not good at all, very disappointed at this restaurant.  Will never come back.",

The squid and leeks in black bean sauce, the fried oysters in xoxo sauce, the crab kalhoon style, and several other dishes are so good. the Hot and sour soup is done perfectly and served at a perfect temperature. Their egg drop soup is also very very good.   It is authentic Chinese food and they have several fresh seafood options coming directly from several tanks right in front of you. Great prices, and one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix area altogether. Recently moved from Phoenix to Oakland area of California. Wish I could have brought my Nee House.",

The food was excellent....however, this was our second time experiencing poor service, which we thought was an aberration on our first visit!  All wait staff are exceedingly rude to the point of exasperation!  They are not attentive and act as though they are enduring you!  We had to ask for hot tea repeatedly; after entrees arrived (with a time gap  between each) we had to ask repeatedly for the accompanying rice. Insult ended our experience...when presented with the bill we were asked by two wait staffers to vacate our table...even though no one was waiting for a table and several tables were vacant.  We will definitely NEVER return to this venue!",

Instead of driving a lot further south to mesa, this place offers some great food.  I would consider it a little pricier than your typical Chinese take out place (especially if you compare to Asian Cafe Express in Mesa), but it also operates as a higher end seafood restaurant and not the place you go for orange/kung pao chicken.  Try it out, and I would recommend ordering the roast duck  I have it at 4.5 stars right now, but would happily bump it to a 5 if I see consistency when I go back",

This place made me want to walk out the moment I walked in, but my parents suggested it and said it was good. Hey, I have been to \"Hole in the Wall\" type places that had amazing food, so I thought we'd stick it out.  Things went south fast.  3 orders of veggie egg rolls, 6 total, all still frozen in the middle.  My wife and mother pulled dead flies from the bok choy in the Cod dish.  My dad and I agreed the sauce for the garlic eggplant was gross.  The steamed white rice was bad... HOW DO YOU MESS UP STEAMED WHITE RICE?!?!  The shrimp fried rice never arrived (maybe just as well). Never going back. Stay away.",

Nice!  I have tried several of the lunch specials as well as some of the authentic dishes on the fish side of the menu. Lunch portions are very large and a great value. Really liked the Deep Fried Oysters with Black Bean Sauce and a Seafood dish I ordered with Crispy Noodles off the dinner menu. So many choices.  Not bad for this part of town. It is hard to find anything similar around here without driving a great distance. Service is a little more Sour than Sweet depending on who you get. This is fine if you are talking about soup of course. I generally like to let the server order for me based on what they recommend and did not get much help. Would like to see a little more enthusiasm.  Give it a try and see what you think. I will definitely be back again for the lunch specials and then some.  3.5 STARS",
