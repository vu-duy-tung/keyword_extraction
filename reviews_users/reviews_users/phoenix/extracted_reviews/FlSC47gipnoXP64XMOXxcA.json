I ordered a chocolate croisant to go. When I got home the chocolate filling consisted of whole unmelted chocolate chips, not nice to bite into, and the runny chocolate drizzle on top ruined the presentation. The end result, however, was good... I put it in my oven, melted the chocolate chips and along with her cream cheesey filling it tasted delicious.",

The food is fantastic, the peope are wonderful, and this has now become my new favorite sandwich shop in the whole of the Phoenix metropolitan area!",

It was so good my fiance and I were planning on buying several of the cakes for our wedding. So much for that. They also make paninis. They are still good, but if you are a fan of the older style, you might be dissapointed. Last time I ate here I ordered the pancetta panini and was assured it would be made the same as it always was. It was not. I would really like to give this place a higher rating, bc they do still have good food. I just prefer the older menu and style over this new one. If you do go, I would definitely recommend trying the waffles.",

We found this place in late September early October I reviewed it, it was heavn, I have not stopped thinking about , We all climbed in the car to go ! as we drove up we knew the name was different and the \"Grand opening' made me cringe... as a short Hispanic girl walked out in a uniform top t shirt, my skin crawled, I said are you knew owners? \"YUP\"  is it the same reciepes?\" \"NOPE\"  I saw a Churro where once a beautiful flan or creme brulee once stood. all 5 of us walked out.  Such a disappointment, I wish  the owners that were so friendly  were wise enough to tell us the truth, that they were selling it, I thought  this was no  location for them to do well, (better suited for Scottsdale)  or better area that appreciates European delights now I can tell you it wasn't even worth a taste,  or the long drive  there from East Mesa. so  so sad.  but next month at Disneyland at the Steak house 55 I will be having my favorite creme brullee.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had passed this place multiple times because it's right next to Food City and we go  there often. On Sunday morning we were looking for a new breakfast spot and we were surprised that this place came up on yelp because when I think of sweet desert cafe I think... desert. Or bakery or some sort so after reading the reviews there were more good ones than bad so we thought to give it a try. Originally I was craving something sweet like pancakes or crepes but when I got there I decided to go with a breakfast burrito and my boyfriend ordered a steak and egg omelette. When you go in you don't sit down to order you go up to the counter, order and then they bring it out to you. The place is small enough to where they can just bring it out without knowing a table number. It's a very cute place with a good vibe and my personal experience wasn't necessarily BAD, but it could have been better. When my boyfriend ordered his omelette, the lady repeated \"okay, steak and egg omelette?\" And he said yes. We ordered 2 coffees and sat down. The coffee took a little over 5 minutes to come out to us which is fine but no water cups were provided while we waited. We had to ask for those later. When we got our food two burritos were brought out and just sat in front of us. He ordered an omelette, not a burrito. I didn't know which was mine so we asked and she didn't know either which was shocking... shouldn't you know the difference between the two? Anyway, he was fine with the steak and egg burrito instead of the omelette. He said his was okay and mine was just really salty. It was hard to fully enjoy the flavors because of the amount of salt. The standard breakfast burrito has eggs, bacon, ham and cheese. Maybe if there were potatoes or something in it the salty ness would have been less overwhelming. A couple sat down next to us and the lady had ordered a BLT and when the BLT came out, she took a bite and noticed that the bacon was missing... from a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich. So it was just lettuce and tomato. She goes up and tells the lady at the counter and the lady apologized and brought out a side of bacon for her. The customer ordered an egg with her BLT as well which she did receive with the sandwich, but when her bacon was brought out the excuse was \"they were just really focused on your egg.\" That was a little frustrating to hear. Don't make excuses just apologize and give her what she asked for. Even when my boyfriend received his wrong order she said \"I heard you say burrito not omelette\" but she repeated the order back to us and confirmed she heard omelette in the beginning. Nothing irritates me more than excuses. I'm sorry but just take responsibility that you made a mistake or that your cooks made a mistake and don't try to turn it around on your customers. The lady wasn't rude, but she was just making excuses. The place is small and pretty packed when busy so I can see how only having one or two people operating the front house can be difficult but maybe have more people working during your peak hours because I think that was the reason for the mistakes... too busy and not enough staff. I think the place has potential to be better but I can't say this is a place that I will wake up and say \"I want to go here for breakfast\" because it just wasn't anything special. Oh and I almost forgot, I took my coffee with me when I left because it was served in a styrofoam cup with a lid. By the time I got home 10 minutes later I picked up the cup out of the cup holder and it actually broke in half. Yep. The cup broke in half and the coffee spilled all over my cup holders. So the coffee was still too hot and basically melted the cup. Can't say I expected that. I don't like making negative reviews but my reason is just to let the owners know you have potential to be better but just be a little more attentive and maybe invest in some better coffee cups, stop making excuses for your mistakes and maybe offer customers water upon arrival so when it takes too long to make coffee at least we have something to sip on. It's Arizona and it's hot out, water is essential.",

The picture on menu showed greens, tomato, avocado, and onion in it but it only had the first two ingredients.  Perhaps it's an extra add on but I wish the picture was of the default toppings.  The cakes in their fridge display looked amazing especially the super dark-colored red velvet cake.  This is more of a place to frequent if you live nearby and need a very casual and tasty breakfast or lunch.  If I'm ever nearby again, I would consider the desserts.",

Don't let the location put you off either, while it is randomly placed the interior is clean and comfortable.",

They are friendly and helpful. They serve traditional cafe fare (croissants, paninis coffee, breakfast items) and desserts.   My wife and I ordered a beef pastrami panini and chocolate croissant. My two girls split a waffel and eggs w/ spinach and onion. The fact that they willingly ate it is a testament to how good the food is because at 18 months and nearly four years old they can be quite the picky eaters.  For how great the service and food is the cafe is not without it's blemishes. The decor is minimal and cheap feeling. They do not have accommodations for small children so be prepared to hold the little ones while eating or taking turns eating with your spouse or significant other. The big issue is no changing station for parents of kids in daipers. This may be a deal breaker for some. I will simply just plan for these trips. Even the negatives can be tolerated since this establishment opened in Dec of 2015. Not bad for being open just under a year.  9/10 would eat again",

We ordered a Creme Brulee, which we ate there, and it was delicious! The sugar on top was perfectly torched (torched? Is that the right word?! Crispy? ANYWAY!), hearing the spoon crack into the soft and silky custard underneath was satisfying to hear! It was the most light, smooth, and subtly sweet Creme Brulee I have had to date. A war was about to erupt between us since it was so good, next time we'll order our own!  We also got a Tres Leche and Lava Cake to go (we wanted to share these pieces of gold with the rest of the family at home!), the Tres Leche is very yummy, it has caramel drizzled on top, and the cake and whipped cream is amazing with the condensed milk drizzled around the cake itself! The Lava Cake itself looks amazing, we haven't had a chance to break into that yet but I'm pretty sure, judging by the other reviews and photos we've see on their Facebook and Yelp page, it's also going to taste amazing!!  Next time we're going to try their panini's - which sound amazing!",

I ordered the Nutella and cream crepes and was charged extra for requesting strawberries and when I got home after picking up my order they were not included in my meal. So it was good, but a little too sweet for breakfast at 10AM. Also ordered the tres leches because I'm pregnant and I can do what I want. But wasn't spongy and light like it's supposed to be. Let me say though my BANANA MILKSHAKE WAS THE BEST. So thumbs up to that and omelet; thumbs down for crepes and tres leches.",

    "text": "This is a quaint little cafe with absolutely scrumptious Sammies and Sweets. We happened to be in the Tempe area and were looking for a place for our family of 4 to have lunch. Being our first time, we were going to order 4 sandwiches to try, but the owner suggested we get two kids croissants for our daughter (aged 3) and son (17 months) to save money and it would be the perfect size for their small appetites. I ordered the Pizza Panini and the Beef Pastrami to split with my husband. The service was a little sluggish, but the staff are so friendly and the food itself was worth the wait! Tried the pizza panini first and the focaccia texture was astounding! Crisp, flakey exterior and an airy, fluffy interior, it was perfectly toasted and paired well with the rich tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni. This one was hands down our favorite between the two. The beef pastrami was good and had a very green, herb-y flavor and with your choice of cheese and veggies, was definitely a hearty sandwich. We ordered their ice blended mocha and salted caramel coffees, and they were just perfect. Sweet, creamy and almost a dessert in themselves! Their flavor was on point!  We ended our meal with a chewy, fudgy brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and, like piranha, we devoted it in seconds! My few notes for improvement would be that the high top pub tables were not the easiest to seat two small kids. One of us had to eat with the little guy on our lap since they didn't offer high chair seating, which makes sense since the tables were too tall for a high chair to meet up to anyhow.  The other critical note is that they do not offer sides with their sandwiches, so if you are super hungry, plan accordingly. Other than that, this is my new fave eatery in Tempe!",

The chorizo crepe was spot on too. Right amount of spice and flavoring. For dessert, we ordered a slice of cheese cake and that was really good too.

The vibe is good and Mike up front was very welcoming and informative. Great service all around. We'll definitely be back",

I had a chocolate croissant and caramel macchiato. My boyfriend had a beef pastrami panini.   Chocolate Croissant - I really enjoyed it. It was warm and soft with an appetizing presentation! It's a bit sweet since it's filled with cream and chocolate and then drizzled with more chocolate and powdered sugar! Mmmmmm . But if you love that kinda thing then I highly recommend coming by to at least try this item.  Caramel Macchiato - Nothing amazing to write home about. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either.  I was a bit disappointed by the size of the drink. It seemed really small. If they had put it in a smaller mug, I might not have noticed.   Pastrami Panini - The bread was warm and crisp, and the fillings were flavorful. I thought it was the perfect proportion for a lunch order. People should take advantage of the custom veggies and toppings!",

    "text": "I've been sitting writing this review for a long while and I just couldn't justify withholding this experience.  Wife ordered a passable breakfast but it definitely didn't seem worth the money, even at the time. It was okay but absolutely forgettable. I ordered some kind of  burrito with hash brown and the potatoes will dripping wet with grease. We also ordered a crepe place which was forgotten entirely until I mentioned that I would like a refund if it wasn't ever going to get made. This mist been their reminder to make something ASAP because \"the order that was sitting there but they assumed we wanted to wait to see until we were done with our breakfasts\" still had a 5+ minute delay.   Thank goodness they at least made the forgotten item good (Mixed Berry crepe) because it was able to momentarily make me forget that my third drink (aside from coffee and water) was oil with potato garnish.   And, while this isn't chronological at this point, I have to say that this should have been the biggest sign of all: the coffee SMELLED BAD. Like, expired bad. Maybe I'm just a nonconfrontational idiot but I figured maybe it was just me and I could mask it with french vanilla cream but it tasted like it smelled. They have two pump-carafes out so, having choked back my first cup, I'd try the other to prove to myself that not every flaming bag on your door step is poop.  Wrong. As I'm pouring it out I have to mention something.  Me: \"What kind of coffee is this?\"  Them: \"Do you like it?\" Me, internally: *Dying to know what they have to say* Me: \"It's okay\"  Them: \"Does it matter?\" Wow. Does it matter? I hope it matters soon because this is much worse than a practical joke. I have to think that they're either completely oblivious in how to clean their carafes or they've got the residue from an amalgam of coffee roasters because something was rancid. Answering my question how they did and forgetting our order was bad enough to consider not going again, the food and coffee quality on top are a sure-fire way to score an individual boycott.  tl;dr - The food was bad. The dessert was okay. The coffee was the literal worst I've EVER had. No exaggeration. The \"service\" was atrocious.",

We had a dulcet de leche crepe that once we tried (Sharing with hubby and 7yo son) we literally fought over til it was devoured!  It was soooo delish and fresh, but not overly sweet. Customer service was great and the price for possibly the best crepe I've ever had foesnt even seem enough. Fantastic place! Must try If you're In town.",

I didn't see the lady and man who seemed like owners. Also, They no longer serve the Creme brulee :(  We ordered Hazelnut coffee and veggie omelette. The coffee was much better than the last time but the omelette was disappointing, the veggies inside were a little raw and the whole thing was too bland. They served with two slices of bread and i liked how they had put butter on it.  Overall I wasn't impressed like the last time and the price is definitely higher for a breakfast. I will visit again and hope to change my opinion.",

I also had a bite of the beef pastrami sandwich and that was delicious!  The only thing I'd have to but a note on is that the Tuna pate was a bit runny, so it fell out of the sandwich. And it there wasn't much tuna in it. But besides that it was still good!  We ordered the lava cake with ice cream for desert. The cake was rich and very chocolatey! Good way to end the meal!",

The owners are so incredibly nice and sweet and explained the menu selections to us. We even got some free samples of macarons which were amazing.  I ordered a new item on their menu, the pancetta panini, and shared some tres leches cake. The panini bread was awesome and had the perfect amount of crispness. The pancetta was a little too salty for me but was a good portion and came with Dijon mustard and a plethora of fresh vegetables such as kale and handpicked basil. The tres leches cake looked amazing and tasted lightly sweet with a perfect soft cream soaked cake. The owner said it was the most popular item on their menu and I can see why!  I had a mocha blended coffee to go with my meal which was refreshing with a lot of chocolate flavor and a light taste of coffee.   The interior is cute with Paris themed decorations.  I'll be back for more delicious sweets and sandwiches!",

    "text": "My breath smells like cat food!  ...if cat food was actually tuna pate.  Wow! What a GREAT lunch! This place is a True mom-and-pop shop! The owners are seriously the sweetest people ever. Passionate about their menu, they'll tell you how everything is made, ask about what you like, what they suggest, et cetera. They will talk and talk, show you videos of creme brulee being cracked open on their Instagram, and call you over to watch them dress their desserts. They'll drag you into a long and pleasant conversation about how a retired professor from Venezuela found her True passion for baking! The husband and wife will tell you how they're making the desert (not a typo for dessert) more sweet --- Sweet Desert is where it's at!  I had ordered myself a Tuna Pate Panini after the husband, a charismatic Spanish gentleman, convinced me I had to try it.  For the record, Tuna Pate is tuna salad.  I ended up trading my pal Linh L. for half his Ham & Salami Panini so I can try two flavors but I'll be honest, I wish I kept my panini for myself because it was amazing! I know you're wondering how someone can be this excited over tuna salad but I was.  The homemade pesto paired with the tuna nicely and I had ordered it with European Swiss Cheese. It was refreshing, light to the taste, and incredibly creamy. I couldn't get enough.  The Ham & Salami was alright but that Tuna Pate Panini was money!  For dessert, Linh and I shared a freshly baked Tres Leches (we got a front row seat as the owner drizzled hot caramel over it!) and a Creme Brulee as per Ann R. and Amber R.'s suggestion. My homies know what's up because that might have been the best creme brulee I ever had. It had a very light and subtle vanilla taste, it was ridiculously smooth, and it wasn't too sweet! And that crust... the best!  The Tres Leches was also enjoyable.  It has a meringue topping and not whipped cream.  The caramel had hardened on top by the time we ordered a slice and gave it a nice crunchy texture.  Between the tres leches and creme brulee though, the creme brulee stole my heart.    Anyways, I'm completely head-over-heels over this place and y'all need to stop in and fall in love too!",

    "text": "Another episode of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"  We walked here from our hotel down the road, and as we walked up I wondered what we were getting ourselves into. The restaurant is located in the back area of a little strip mall, and its sparely decorated with inexpensive tables and chairs, more like a fast food restaurant.   You order your food at the counter--they were out of the carnitas burrito which was a little bit of a bummer, but I switched it out for chicken. We also ordered the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito, all of which arrived piping hot and smelling like heaven.   The burrito was absolutely delicious, but huge! I only got through about half of it before throwing in the towel. My fellow eaters also plowed through their meals and said everything was fantastic.   If you're looking for a place that does things simply but great, this is definitely a good brunch space to check out. It's walking the fine line between fast food and full-blown brunch spot, but its definitely walking it well.",

I just wanted a regular stack of buttermilk pancakes. These came out quickly were hot and fluffy. Hubby ordered the breakfast burro. He was dot disappointed. Hefty portions. He also tried their Bulletproof coffee. It was awesome! If you like coffee and need a little extra push, try this!!!  We left with bellies full and very happy,",

We ordered a porky burrito, croissant breakfast sandwich, and mixed berry crepes. Everything appeared to be cooked to order and came out steaming hot. I definitely burned my mouth on that burrito because it was so good that I couldn't wait for it to cool down.  The croissant breakfast sandwich was solid, the ingredients were fairly simple but put together well on a massive croissant. The porky burrito (can also be an omelette) was stuffed with really soft scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, ham. The tortilla was soft and chewy and the burrito was topped with just a little bit of extra meat and cheese. If this was on my way to work, I'd be ordering this at least once a week, if not more. By far the best breakfast burrito I've had in years. If they renamed to porky burrito cafe, honestly they'd still get 5 stars from me.  All that being said, their sweet stuff appears to be good too. Our mixed berry crepes were topped with a ton of berries and filled with a slightly sweet cream that made them feel really light. Prices were super reasonable, the inside was small but clean, and the staff was super friendly.",

It's located by Food City, which made it easy to find and was perfect since I needed to buy some items from there beforehand.   We walk in and go to the counter to place our orders. The place is small but cozy and I'm glad we were there early before it filled up. I ordered the pancake combo which comes with two pancakes, two eggs, hash browns, and bacon or sausage (I opted out of the meat). I was able to add a topping so I chose strawberries. My friend wanted to order from their lunch menu and got the veggie burrito. I loved my pancakes, they even looked different from your typical breakfast house pancakes. These looked homey and I particularly liked their ruched edges and dusting of powdered sugar. My eggs and hash browns were good as well, I love my sweet and savory choices. My friend liked her burrito too and prices were definitely fair.   I also got a hot chocolate but it wasn't anything special, more on the sweet side than I'd like. The woman who took our order and got it ready was friendly and welcoming and I liked the vibe here. I came in with the intention of ordering crepes so I may have to visit again to try those.  They have 10% cash back through Yelp which is a great deal! Still waiting on mine to go through though.",

I always get Monte Cristo sandwiches and this time just like the last, there were egg shells in the egg. A tiny egg shell is fine, but when there's several, no. In the order we also got the Monte Cristo Crepe. When we got it we thought it was the wrong order. It looked like it was a burrito. There were no berries or powdered sugar on them, just a big blob of melted cheese. Nothing to what the description and photo said. It was good while it lasted.

My husband wasn't interested in trying it because he thought it was all desserts, but I convinced him that the reviews were all positive and there was a good selection of food.  As we walked in, we were greetly warmly by the owner as were all the other customers that came in.  Many call-ahead orders were also picked up while we ate, which is a good sign!  I ordered the Chilaquiles with green sauce and he ordered the Mango & Coconut Crepes.  My meal was served on a bed of tortilla chips which I loved because usually when I order it from other places, it's served on 2 small tortillas that end up soggy after a few minutes.  The tortilla chips kept everything mostly crunchy!  My over-medium egg was cooked perfectly!  The Mango/Coconut crepes - definitely a must!  The perfect amount of sweetness and absolutely delicious!  So glad I found this place and it's less than 5 minutes away!  Cannot wait to try the other items on the menu!",

The croissant was loaded w/ bacon (no skimping here!) and the crepes were a meal in themselves. In fact, I got about 2-1/2 meals out of it all. I would have gone back later in the afternoon but life intruded. That's okay, I now have someplace to go for breakfast this coming weekend.

I personally purchased the pancetta panini and it was so so good! I will definitely be coming again.  Ps: they have a chocolate croissant they make fresh daily in house. I recommend to go early to get them super fresh!",

We all ordered a different dessert And all 4 of us were vey happy with out choices! We had Red Velvet Cake, the Chocolate croissant, the Tres Leches cake and chocolate fondant which was basically a lava cake. All 4 were delicious! The husband and wife owners were pleasant to talk to and very proud of their homemade treats which are all made from scratch by her! Baking was obviously her passion and it certainly showed in the deserts we tried! They also have sandwiches and breakfast. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be going back next time we want some delicious desserts!",

Today I had the huevos rancheros and it was also very good. I love this place.",

Her eyes lite up at first bite. She savored each fork full. By far the best red velvet cake ever. Jose and my son decided on macaroons for his dessert. We came home with all 3 flavors. All 3 equally stellar picks. Since it is summer vacation (kids out of school), after tonight's lovely stop at EuroCafe....kids want to return tomorrow for breakfast.  Thank you my dear friends!!  Martha and Jose you are priceless.",

Instead I got soggy Eggo looking waffles that came with strawberry preserves from a can. The eggs tasted like it was cooked in a microwave, dense and weird texture. Maybe their desserts would be better but I will never know because I won't come back. I had great expectations with this place based on the reviews and that it's a European cafe, but the taste of their food makes me feel like they would just buy it at Costco pre made and sell individually. The customer service was nice, though.",

    "text": "Great little cafe. My boyfriend and I went in the morning the other day before I went to work.  I ordered coffee and banana nutella crepes with sausage and eggs while my boyfriend ordered a pizza panini sandwich thing and some salted caramel coffee thing.  The food was great; my crepes were just the right thickness and texture, cooked well with the right amount of filling. The coffee was brewed well and the little bit of the salted caramel I tried was great too.  My boyfriend's only complaint was that the sandwich was maybe slightly too saucy. He was too shy to say so at the cafe, sorry!  But that leads to another thing... The owner lady was great. She was very friendly and talked with us while we were in and made it very welcoming. Most importantly you could tell she cared, as she actually bothered asking for feedback/criticism on the food.  Nice atmosphere too, nice and clean.  Great experience all around, highly recommended.",

When I walked in, I was greeted by the husband and wife owners, they had a lot of energy and stressed the fact that everything was homemade. I told her that I only wanted dessert and coffee. Again, she stated that everything was made in house and everyday.   There were I think, 4 dessert items to choose from. Creme Brulee, a chocolate lava cake, red Velvet and Tres Leches cake. I love Creme Brulee, so I went with that and instead of coffee, I ordered A cappuccino.   The cappuccino wasn't as hot as I liked, but had really good coffee flavor.   The disappointing aspect of my visit came when I got the Creme Brulee. I noticed immediately that the middle of it was sunk in. It was served in a small round ramekin. When I cracked through the sugar crust, the Creme Brulee was curdled. I was totally separated and had little chunks like the eggs scrambled. (See pictures, they speak for themselves).   I will give them another try, they may have had a bad day, or are still working out the bugs from being a new restaurant.",

I read great reviews about Sweet Dessert so I was looking extremely forward to trying the food. I looked at the menu and the chilaquiles looked very appetizing so I decided to go with my first instinct and try these out. When I first started eating the chilaquiles all I tasted was a strong lime taste. Being Hispanic I know what chilaquiles should taste like and these tasted a lot different than I have ever tasted. All I could taste was an overwhelming lime taste that empowered the whole dish. I was not able to finish even half of the dish due to the taste.",
