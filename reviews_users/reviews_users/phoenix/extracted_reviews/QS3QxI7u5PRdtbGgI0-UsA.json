If the huge hunks of melt in your mouth salmon sashimi weren't enough, they also have a happy hour menu with decent priced rolls- you have to try the Salmon dynamite roll with baked salmon on top of a cali roll.  If there were any question this were the best sushi place, to really seal the deal they offer $1 appetizer when you order a beer.  It's our new fave weekly place!",

    "text": "This place is my favorite spot in town to go to for sushi. Its not the cheapest but if you go at night during the week (Sunday-Thursday) they have a happy hour roll list and that is definitely the way to go. Everyone here is super nice. The manager Kim is absolutely amazing. I also love the servers. You can tell when one of them is new but we have all been there. The food is amazing. Everything is fresh. The fish is to die for and the rolls are fantastic. They make the rolls pretty big so be ready to take a big bite. I usually go with no rice so I don't fill up as fast because once you start eating your not going to want to stop.  Hands down when I don't know what I want for dinner I will order to go from here. I always get cravings for their sushi and no other restaurant comes close to satisfying my cravings.  O and if you want spectacular service ask for Kayla or Kristen to be your waitress. They are hands down the best and have been there the longest so they know what they are talking about when recommending rolls.  Make sure you get there early if your not willing to wait for a table because they fill up pretty fast. If there is a large group they fill up even faster because the space is so small, so not the best for 10+ groups, but they will accommodate. There is no open seating even at the sushi bar, they will seat you.   **They will modify every type of roll for your needs, gluten free, vegetarian, or even if you just want the chef special. Make sure you ask for Luis to make your chef special, the way the food comes out looks like art work.",

True sushi chefs pay incredible attention to mouthfeel, the ratio of ingredients, the cuts that they make, the temperature of the ingredients that they serve, the incredibly sharp edge on their very delicate obscenely expensive knives, etc...  Even the sushi rice is very hard to make properly and is a skill unto itself. When done right, sushi can be truly amazing. This place doesn't care about those details.  If you want to scarf down large quantities of thick cut rolls and nigiri for cheap, this is your place.  Some people are into that.  For those that aren't, skip it.",

    "text": "I have been to this sushi place at least a half dozen times. The first couple of times I really liked it, the sushi was inexpensive and had good sized portions. After going a few times, I began to notice how bad the service was. The waitresses are rude and act as though you are wasting their time. They bring out the food in the strangest order as well. Today when I went (which will surely be the last time I go) they brought out miso soup and the sushi I ordered at the same time, followed by my dad's stir fry and followed much later by the sushi my mom ordered. And the edamame came last. Very strange.  One thing that I noticed today in this particular location was that the entire place smelled like cat pee or a litter box. We sat there for a minute once we sat down trying to decide if we should leave or not because the smell was so terrible. Then, a group sat down at the table next to us and immediately started talking about how terrible it smelled. We gathered that the carpets in the restaurant were a little wet so they had just shampooed the carpets and had not let them air out properly to dry so they started to smell sort of like a wet dog. Which was disgusting.  Of the rolls I ordered today, one was the Vegas roll. I've had many of these at many different sushi places. Traditionally, there is cream cheese, salmon, tuna and yellow tail and some other stuff. The \"vegas roll\" at Sakana was a huge chunk of cream cheese, a huge hunk of salmon and some cucumber. No other types of fish. Eeek. The only flavor that stood out was the salmon.   So naturally since the roll was no good, I didn't eat it and when the waitress asked if I wanted a box, I said no, the roll wasn't good at all, I didn't like it. Instead of taking it away and asking if she could get me something else to try, she leaves the roll on the table and walks away to get the check, which she left the Vegas roll on.   The whole thing that irritates me about this place is that I know this review will not make a difference. Even though I have had several bad experiences here, every time I go it is completely packed. There is something about this place that people seem to love and I just don't see it.",

Pleasantly, she was!  The place was busy when we arrived and we had to wait 20 mins for a table.  However, as soon as we sat to wait, the hostess asked us if we would like a drink.  Of course we would!  It certainly helped the wait time pass.  We were seated at a comfortable table and immediately offerred drinks and/or $.50 appetizers.....$.50 appetizers?!?  We ordered two; scallop poppers and spring rolls.  Both were pretty good for $.50.  We then ordered two rolls, the eel and a jalapeno boat (tuna, avocado, tempura type) - both were fantastic!  Sushi - albacore & spicy scallops...again really delicious.  The albacore was like butter.  It was cold and refreshing.  Then we had the yellowtail sashimi - a True test of a good sushi restaurant - and it was absolutely fabulous.  We finished with a standard spicy tuna toll and it was great.  The fish tasted pretty fresh and that was impressive.  Im not joking - I was really impressed.  The best part is that the prices are fantastic and incredibly reasonable.   Our check and sugar/water drenched oranges were delivered promptly after our meal and we left happy and excited to have found a good sush place in AZ!",

    "text": "In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana.  I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  I'm craving it now as I'm writing this!  I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.    The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful.  The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh.   The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?)  All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If we're back in town, we will definitely return.  I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!",

The white fish saute is a favorite and comes with sauteed veggies and rice. If you can swing in at lunch they have a great sashimi special for $14.99.",

So let's review the rolls 1st:  orange roll, roller coaster, crispy California, bear roll were awesome. A couple next to us didn't receive Ginger or Wasabi on their roll platter - but we shared ours.  Those that ordered the chicken cutlet wished they got veggies or noodles as their side - instead it came w/ styrofoam noodles (their words - not mine).  One of our guests ordered the Terayaki Chicken w/ veggies & loved it!  We like the Parmesan Edamame.  A couple of peeps ordered the lunch special w/ rolls & chicken & they ate it all - so I guess no complaints there.  We had a party of 17 at lunch today & all in all they did a super job accommodating us!  Would definitely return here!",

Actually, too thick for me given the small amount of rice they included. (Maybe just me, too high meat to rice ratio makes it taste rubbery to me). But I'm sure some people will love that.   Prices were a little high. 8 pieces nigiri & 3 maki rolls came out to about $60. The maki rolls were also very good & again, they had generous amounts of meat. Very tasty.   I would give this place a try if you like sushi. Also, their lunch prices are veryyy good.",

I've had Mexican all over the world from London to Osaka to Iowa, and it was all good. As is sushi all over the world. Um, fish gets flown around the world to these places. It doesn't matter where you live, you probably aren't getting it out of your backyard ... in some cases, even if the Ocean is your backyard. So relax.   Sakana is good sushi. Especially, if you appreciate the taste of raw fish by itself. It also is reasonably priced. Sure, there are more prestigious sushi joints, but this is good fish at a good price. Since I'd rather not spend $50 on myself for dinner every time I go to sushi, it's a nice option.   And rant over.",

ENVIRONMENT - There's a bar where you can eat, as well as a comfortable seating area. it's not the best for large groups, as the place is not too big. They also have a TV playing MLB, in case you want a place to watch your games :P  SERVICE - Friendly and prompt!  FOOD - I don't expect much in terms of authenticity for Japanese cuisine in Arizona, so I guess the food was okay in terms of a Japanese Fusion style. Their names for their rolls are quite punny - 'marilyn monroll' LOL.  +Salmon Dynamite Roll $5.95 - The presentation of this was quite interesting. There's 5 pieces on the bottom (see pic) with salmon and other toppings all loaded on top, so it looks like one giant piece (almost like a sushi pizza). i enjoyed this, and it's filling if you order another small dish with it.  + Tempura Udon $8.99 - Price isn't too bad, and the udon broth was quite yummy. The udon noodles itself had a great texture as well.   BUT the tempura disappointed me. At first I was just expecting 2 tempura shrimps with the udon, so I was pleasantly surprised that a whole plate of tempura came. But that plate of tempura just consisted of 1 shrimp, a whole bunch of carrots, 2 peppers (not a fan... first time I've seen carrots and peppers being battered.....blergh, not a fan), 1 broccoli, and 1 squash.  I'd probably just stick to the special rolls next time - no more udon for me.  Also, don't forget to check in since you get some free edamame!",

She chose this place for here bday.   We got there at 5:30 right when it opened so we were instantly seated.   It was happy hour and they had the basic rolls half off. We ordered the spicy tuna and the tootsie roll.   The tootsie roll was not the normal salmon cream cheese schpeal it normally is. It was just cali roll with Shrimp tempura.   I would give the spicy tuna roll 3 stars, it gets 3 and not 2 only because it wasnt fishy.  It was just rice and heavily mayo'd tuna, with no spice.  They should have added a little green onion put half as much mayo and maybe added a little cucumber for crunch.   The tootsie roll is impossible to f up there, so it was good for what it was.   We also ordered one of the speacialty rolls the yellow tail tempura. It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor.   It seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab. They should invest in a few new chefs or training or something. Even the shape was off, it seemed this guy was straight out of school? Maybe it was  just the guy who happened to be there that night?  I would go back but only if I was meeting someone there.",

However, at the bar they have all the brightly colored fish they are using laid out in a window and it all looks very fresh.   I usually go during happy hour and I like how they have presentations of their daily special rolls at the bar when you walk in. All of the rolls I have tried taste great, however, some of them tend to fall apart on you. They aren't very tightly rolled and the rice isn't as sticky as some other sushi bars. I'll give it 3 stars for A-OK because, for the price, I like it but I don't think it goes above and beyond.   I'll definitely be back to grab some quick tasty sushi for happy hour.",

Now Scottsdale and the rest of the Valley are not lacking in sushi restaurants - especially  trendy sceney places.  Yawn.  In fact, I found there to be more sushi bars than I expected for our desert outpost.  But what separates one from the others are: good food, fresh fish, good service, good value.  And this place def does it right...  Plus it's the only place I know of (can anyone help me out here?) in the area where I can find the holy grail of all sushi - the rich, but-gusting, let-me-workout-before-I-eat-this baked scallop roll.  Now, let me explain.   In \"Sushi Heaven\" (otherwise known to laymen as Ventura Blvd. in L.A.) there is this place that serves this and is known for this tasty delicacy.  But I have yet to find a place that serves the baked scallop roll (basically a california roll covered in warmed baked scallops), but along came Sakana.   Prices are reasonable, the decor is a happy medium - not too trendy, not too drab.  I never have to wait here - but always find myself waiting when I go to RA.  Whatever.  Something is wrong with that picture...  The crowd ranges the spectrum from older couples, families with kids, younger couples, and friends catching up after work.  I hear there are other locations throughout the Valley, but this is the one I frequent.   Another bonus for this place is the location away from Old Town Scottsdale and the parking headaches there.  Here, however, you will find parking to be easy since it's in an Albertson's strip mall.",

The whole boat is large enough for two people... or one hungry person ;P I've been coming here regularly at least every other week if not every week for over a year. Never gotten sick or had a bad experience. Also - ask for separate checks up front - or you'll wait for them to separate the orders out.",

The calamari salad is the bomb, you can easily split one with a friend for starters. The rolls are all great, I haven't tried anything I didn't like. Ask for Happy Hour specials as well. Be aware of their hours of operation. Fast pick up times too. Have never had a bad experience there, highly recommend it if you're looking for great sushi in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars - wish Yelp would offer that option!  I would never have stopped at Sakana if a friend had not taken me there.  Located in a typical AZ strip mall, it looks unimpressive from the outside.  Inside, it is small, fairly uninteresting, but comfortable.  You can sit at the bar or at one of several tables.  Service was slow, but friendly.  We ordered the gyoza, which was delicious.  Often gyoza seems to be served cooler than I would prefer, but this was hot and well-flavored and delicious.  I had in mind Chicago-sized rolls, so we ordered 4 rolls for dinner.  Waaaay too much food - 2 rolls would have been fine.  The special rolls of the day are on a board by the sushi bar, and the server didn't tell us about them, so I am glad I asked.  The spicy tuna was nothing spectacular, but the spicy crunch California roll was delicious, as was the Tootsie roll and the specialty of the night.    Gyoza, 4 rolls, 2 large Japanese beers for a grand total of $48.  I was shocked - again, I am used to Chicago prices.  What a deal!!!  If I lived in AZ, I would definitely frequent this place, well-priced, casual, comfortable sushi.  Not flashy or trendy or a good place to \"see and be seen\", if that is your thing, better off in Old Town - this is just good sushi.",

I love their Happy Hour if you order a bomber size beer you get to choose one of a variety of apps for .99 which is a great addition to the already good sushi and value.

    "text": "I never thought I'd be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars, but alas I am.  It's sad but True, over the past year I've watched Sakana slip. I'm not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once \"authentic\".  Last night was the last straw.  Like always I ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes, fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing.  This was not the case last night.  There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped.   Next came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls; soft shell crab, Tootsie, and a spicy tuna.  They were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I hate when I see people eating sushi with their hands, but last night I was one of those people.  I tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one.  It tasted....fishy.....and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy, its bad news.  On a good note, the server was very nice. She took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one. She also offered free dessert but we declined and left.  I hate to say it but I will probably not return.   Oh, and did I mention we also had the pleasure of listening to Justin Bieber while we dined.  If I wanted to hang around sake bombing 19 year olds I would have gone to RA. Sorry Sakana.",

    "text": "What can I say that 44 other reviews haven't said.   I first found Sakana when I lived within walking distance of the small eatery. It wasn't until I moved 10 miles away did I start eating there.   My first time I ate there was almost two years ago. I remember being surprised that there was a line outside. From my limited experience with amazing, line-worthy restaurants this, typically meant a good thing. Long story short, I wasn't disappointed.  Sakana is a small sushi bar and restaurant tucked away at the end of a large strip mall. Its rather easy to miss the first time you drive by. I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian (I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food. I'm not German, I'm not going to pretend I can cook German food well - Italian, well, that's another story... moving on). The place can seat about 10 people at the bar, another 50-60 people at tables and despite the amount of people the place can hold it's rather comfortable. The lighting is dim, the music is not intrusive and unless it's a Friday or Saturday its very easy to hear the group you're with even when it spans 2 or 3 tables.  Except for spring rolls (which are totally fabulous) I haven't ordered anything besides sushi & salmon nigiri. This is hands-down the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day, it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating. The nori is rarely ever bitter, salty, chewy or pungent. Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor, texture or presentation of the roll.  Personally I get the same thing every time I go. A Philidelphia roll and an avocado roll inside out (I like my rice outside the nori, thank you). They're my favorite and 9 times out of 10 perfectly made. It's pretty fabulous that the roll pretty much never falls apart which irks me at other places to no end. The salmon is well flavored and very smooth - it practically melts in your mouth.  Other sources (some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies) tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing. Their spicy tuna is fabulous (again doesn't taste like over powering canned tuna) and their eel roll has a surprisingly light taste, it's not as heavy or chewy as I would have thought. Order some rolls, snag some hot green tea (or some chilled cranberry sake) and appreciate some really great sushi rolls. I could do a whole review on just one roll alone...  Beyond their rolls their nigiri (a piece of fish over a bed of rice) is great. Dab some wasabi on it, dip it in some soy and enjoy. A good friend of mine orders nothing but their nigiri - seriously they ordered about 16 pieces. If they have Toro on their list of sashimi, get some. You will not be disappointed..  Other people have mentioned their amazing specials. They're open for lunch now and you can easily get out of there for about 8 bucks (1 or 2 rolls and water to drink). They have a great selection on their Customer Appreciation list (has about 8-12 rolls on there) and offer every evening at least one different dinner special in addition to the 5-10 specials they're offering that night. On the other hand, with a large enough party, you can also end up leaving with a tab in the hundreds. But it's worth it.   If it's only you or you're there with a small group (2 or 3) sit at the bar. You learn some pretty awesome things about preparation and some insider sushi secrets sitting at the bar chatting with the sushi chefs :)   Let me know if you want to go... I don't pass up a trip to Sakana :D",

    "text": "Very nice little Japanese restaurant.  We've been once for lunch and once for dinner.  I love the fact that they cut a thick slab of fish for the sushi and sashimi here, much more so than other Japanese places I've been in Arizona.  This is True Japanese style and how sushi is supposed to be served.    We recently visited another \"high-end\" Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale which served the smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in a restaurant at exorbitant prices. Ridiculous.  Well, that's not what is going on here.   I don't know how or why Japanese restaurants have evolved in the USA into serving super-expensive micro-portions but that ain't how it is in Japan.  Sushi is supposed to be quick and easy comfort food.  A sushi joint in Japan is filled with normal working people chowing down on massive portions of fish, served quickly and without ostentation, not boob-jobbed bulemics eating over-priced, razor thin slices of fish.  Even today, in Tokyo you can get 10 orders of nigiri for less than $20.  Sakana fits nicely into that unpretentious tradition.  At Sakana, the quality of the fish is high.  The menu is not very broad and they don't have a huge selection but what they do have is fresh and excellent.  It is also an excellent value, particularly at lunch where $9.95 buys you a very ample sushi combination.  Service is quick and friendly.  Recommended.",

I'm not a sushi pro but definitely enjoy sushi and I think the quality and portions compare fairly to other sushi restaurants in Scottsdale or Phoenix. My parents live out of town and when they visit, if my mom could come here everyday for lunch she probably would.  The menu specials are always great and its' probably the only restaurant of any type in which the display actually makes me get the special instead of having a waiter come up with a monologue of what the chef's special is for the day.  It may not be the best sushi I'll have in my life, but then again I'm not the pickiest of people perhaps and I've never been disappointed by the service or food which is what matters at the end of my meal.  Only issue is perhaps that the restaurant is not large and due to it's popularity (especially at lunch or the peak hours of dinner) you might have to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated.

I was optimistic about this place based on reviews, but it really is just average.  The atmosphere is pretty good, nice and clean, makes an effort at seeming Japanese.  Portions were very large and we did over order.  Nigiri was fresh.  The waitress either got our order wrong or the shrimp tempura roll looked and tasted like eel and the spicy tuna roll was not spicy.  When asked, she insisted that the plan tuna roll was actually a spicy tuna roll.  It didn't make sense because spicy tuna was delivered as part of the hand roll special and that was actually quite good?   The Eel tempura roll was quite tasty.  I hate fake crab...its bad enough in a California roll, but horrible in a hand roll special, I mean why bother?  All the special rolls are just variations on California Rolls (again, with the fake crab).  I like a combination of nigiri and rolls, but there's just not a lot of imagination here.  Iced green tea was very yummy.  May or may not go back...still searching....",

A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.  The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!",

    "text": "Just got back from Sakana. My office is about 50 yards from Sakana Scottsdale so we go there all the time.   I actually have mixed feelings on Sakana. I know it's a great lunch spot but it might be much more than that ???  My main viewpoint on Sakana is a great lunch place with killer specials where you get excellent value for your dollar. The sushi is fresh and good. The cooked meals are great. The salads are great. Hard to beat when you're doing a lunch & want to have some reasonably healthy options. Add in the proximity and it's a no brainer.  The question in my mind has to do with their dinner options and going big on sushi. When we had them cater one of our holiday parties in the past, we had some conversations with them about what they do and got to talking about some less mainstream dishes: ankimo (monkfish liver), amaebi (sweet shrimp), etc. I didn't realize that they focused on these as well.  So a few weeks after that conversation, my wife and I headed into Sakana for dinner at one point and sat with Ray at the sushi bar. We proceeded to have a great meal. Really excellent. I was shocked as I'd always thought of it more as a \"lunch spot\" and wouldn't have considered it when thinking of going to my favorite spots like Yasu Sushi Bistro, Kampai, etc. Now we haven't been back for dinner since so I don't know if the stars were just aligned or if Ray was taking extra special care of us because of our discussion. So I'm hesitant to expect that we would have a similar experience just wandering in there for dinner. I need to give it another try though to find out.  So with that in mind, I cannot say they don't do great traditional, high quality sushi.   I can definitely say though that the lunches are great and the value is excellent.  From their killer deal of the Sakana lunch to the chirashi to the calimari/jalapeno salad to the chicken cutlet, I've never had a lunch there that I was really disappointed with.  It's probably our number 1 go to lunch spot. Always delivers.",

    "text": "My second visit to Sakana and I was disappointed. My first experience was really great - quiet, neighborhood atmosphere, fresh fish, friendly staff, reasonable prices and really great special rolls and sushi on the menu. What's not to love? Fast forward to my second visit, and I was wondering if I was in the wrong place. Hmm, same tables..same decor...recognize that sushi chef on the left..if this is the same place, why do I feel like I'm at RA??    First, our server was completely disinterested and distracted. We were clearly not her first priority, and likely not her 10th priority either. She brought out everything all at once - including my miso soup and Kirin light! This created a huge dilemma for me because all my food was now sitting there waiting for me to gobble down all at once. I know it won't get cold, but it's the principle of it. The last time I was at Sakana, the rolls were individually spaced for our enjoyment and separate from the appetizer course. I'm pretty sure even RA will bring the soup out first.   Then, the music. During dinner, I lean over to tell my date something unbelievably romantic and realize I am yelling in his ear. Not romantic or cute. Better yet, the blaring music included Pit Bull's most recent Hotel gem and other similarly out of place selections. What? I don't know who picked the music that night, but it seemed completely out of place and a real distraction to my meal. And, I promise, I'm not an old fogey who can't get down.   Finally, I was very disappointed in the sushi that night. It did not seem as fresh as it should be, and I actually had to leave several pieces to be tossed out. Now, I am not one to waste food. I am not a shy eater who nibbles on her salad over the course of a date - I will happily, though perhaps with a slight blush, out-eat any date.  That means, if I let some of my sushi go to the trash, something was not right. Now, it was not foul, nor did I see reason to send everything back. But it just was not that good.   I had one very good 4-5 star experience and then a disappointing 1-2 star experience - so they get a 3 from me right now. I would be willing to give Sakana a third chance - maybe my second experience was on an off night, the stars had not aligned, and I was sleep deprived and overly critical.",

Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.  When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.  If it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.  The lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.  We used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.  The ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.  If you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale.",

I had just spent 8 days in Tokyo after living there for many years, so I wasn't all that excited to try out another \"almost\" Japanese restaurant, but I'm glad I did.  The ramen was just like Japan, full of flavor and extras.  Usually ramen in Phoenix ends up being weak and small, but this was a massive bowl and very strong overall.  I got the tempura, which could have used a little more salt, but the ebi was very good.  Reasonable price overall, very large portion for about $9, then I got the meal option which gave me miso soup, rice, and salad with miso dressing.  The dressing was amazing.  My friends liked the nigiri sushi, but not the rolls as much.  I didn't try it so I can't comment.    I'll be heading back to try some of their other offerings.",

I had the Old School Ramen which is basically Tonkatsu Ramen with Chatsu. The ramen had the right tenderness and the pork favor soup is perfect. The Chatsu had the right among of fat and meat. We were joined by my son and his friends later. They ordered sake and unagi sushi. They said the sake sushi were the best they ever had. Also the shrimp tempura was good. Overall, very good first impression for us and we will definitely come back again.  Edit: My son also had Miso soup and this is the only item that's a little disappointing.

I'm always on the look out for HH sushi places & Sakana is definitely now in the rotation.  They do HH ALL DAY Monday thru Thursday, and they have several options on rolls (not just the typical Cali & tuna rolls). Most of the HH rolls are under $5, and even though it's a smaller portion than the regular menu (5 pieces versus 8), the rolls are good size so the pieces are pretty big. I liked everything I had. The spicy tuna roll was probably my favorite of all the ones I tried.    In addition, the also do a deal where basically you get really cheap appetizers if you get a beer. Some of the apps are a buck (edamame, spring rolls & I think gyoza). I got the spring rolls and they were good.   I'm glad I know about this place now and I'll be back!",

They weren't rolled tight and were falling apart. Then the taste- just kind of tasteless to me. The final straw was when we brought home the leftovers and NO ONE ate them. I mean, you have two sushi fanatics living in the house and we didn't eat our leftovers. It's unheard of in our house.

The special rolls are pretty big and flavorful, but most are filled with some sort of tempura item and/or cream cheese mixture and surrounded with a lot of rice. The fresh fish that was in the sushi rolls were pretty good though. Not many \"normal\" rolls on the menu (eg, didn't see a regular salmon roll, just spicy salmon). The dinner entree selection is pretty limited, the shrimp tempura dinner was just okay. My mom ordered the yellowtail collar dinner entree which she liked. Granted, I generally order plain sushi at sushi restaurants but didn't this time. If I come back I may try the sashimi instead.",

Sakana is a good place to take someone who really likes crab salad; because nearly every roll is a crab salad California roll. Then maybe they add something to it. Seriously.  The green paste wasabi was very weak. I had to use a full teaspoon to feel any heat. The spicy salmon on top of the California roll (oops I mean Alaskan roll) was MINCED. I kid you not. They did not lay some fresh cut salmon on the roll, it was reformed into a salmon chunk from chopped up salmon. BLINK.  What saves Sakana a bit is they had a nice chicken cutlet appetizer, thin, juicy, nice panko. Great for my child who isn't a sushi monster. I saw a salad go by that looked nice. It did get a lot of business, but I suspect it is from people who like very americanized items, in particular the crab salad you can buy at any grocery store.  There were plenty of kids there, so if you want to introduce sushi to a child or someone, this might be a good place. They give you an orange at the end. Nice.  If you are a sushi afficiando... you'll need to look elsewhere.",

I have to back up a bit.... I started with the ahi tataki salad. It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo, and sooooo good (note: I normally HATE salads, just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself). I also tried the spicy tuna roll and it was a big disappointment... BARELY any spice and the tuna tasted a little fishy, definitely not as scrumptious as the tuna in the salad. But I had so many other yummy things to nosh on, I didn't mind abandoning the spicy tuna.   I'm not sure if it's a regular thing, but they had 50c appetizers if you order a Kirin. The prices on all the dishes were totally reasonable. They DON'T have a full bar, I'm not sure why there are 3 votes for that.",

We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for our table, which wasn't bad. I really like their beer and appetizer deal. If you buy a Kiran or Kiran Lite, you get one of their appetizers for 99 cents. You can't beat that. The food was all really yummy and high quality. The prices are pretty good as well. Most of the time you can get either a 5-piece or 8-piece roll, which gives you the chance to try more without spending a lot. They also give you fresh oranges to end your meal. The service was a bit lackluster, but maybe that's just the way the restaurant is run. Since it was my friend's birthday, they brought over the lucky cat statue (excuse me for not knowing what it's called) and sang to him in Japanese, which was pretty cool. In the end, I would definitely eat here again when I'm craving some delicious sushi!",

Please note the dinner menu is different than the lunch menu.  They don't serve Katsu at dinner.  So we ended up ordering sushi.  The sushi was very fresh the pieces are huge. We did order the oysters that were on special, but they didn't seem that fresh.  It is a little pricey, but I did not feel that we were ripped off.  Overall, sushi was good and the atmosphere was nice for a date night.",

They have a large menu with tons of selections- cooked and raw- that everyone in your party would be sure to love! If you have guests that aren't fish/sushi eaters, they have some teriyaki dishes, salads, and miso soup, which is really good!  The first time my boyfriend and I came here, we ordered from the happy hour menu, which is really valid from open-close with the exception of on the weekends. The waitress brought us each a complimentary bowl of miso soup, which was a nice touch!   They have a pretty decent variety on their happy hour menu, ranging from simple California rolls to Las Vegas rolls and other deep-fried, artistic creations. Thinking that the happy hour rolls were going be super small (being that the highest price on the menu was $5/$6) we initially ordered 8 rolls. When our waitress picked up our order card, she was kind enough to tell us that the happy hour rolls are quite large and that 8 was way too much! So, we took her advice and cut our order in half. I was a little skeptical of whether or not the rolls were really small or not, but to my surprise they came out and were HUGE! Each roll comes with about 6 pieces, but the pieces are thicker and larger in diameter than your average sushi rolls!   The sushi is of obvious fresh quality. The ingredients as well are fresh. It's the worst when you get rolls that have brown avocado or mushy cucumber inside.. ick! The sushi is also really nicely presented. Our four rolls came out on a nice wooden cutting board.   The second and third times we came here we ordered the lunch special and the sashimi deluxe. OH. MY. GOSH. I've never in my life seen such value! The lunch special comes with 6 pieces of California rolls, 2 jalapeno boats (jalapeno deep fried and stuffed with crab) and 6 pieces of nigiri. Not to mention it was delicious-- all for $10.95. The sashimi deluxe was even better. You get 12 FAT and LARGE pieces of fresh sashimi for $12.95!!! The best of the trio is the white tuna. I really have never had a piece of sashimi so good that literally you don't want to eat it because if you did that would mean you wouldn't have any left.   Service is average, food is AMAZING. Food comes out quick, so it's a really good option if you want to go on a fast lunch break. Pictures are posted as well.",

We ordered the Las Vegas, spicy tuna, jackpot, and spicy roller coaster roll. The jackpot roll was only edible after removing the golf ball sized blob of gooey fish mess on top of it, and then it was just a mediocre Las Vegas roll. The spicy tuna roll was confusing as it was just tuna alone in a roll- no sauce or spicy element at all... So weird. The ramen was probably the best thing we ordered and it was just slightly better than the kind you can buy at the store for 25 cents a package. I think it's pretty obvious we won't be coming back again.",

I say this because there are higher end places (which i reserve a 5 star rating for).  The lunch specials can't be beat in my opinion and the overall quality is great 9 times out of 10.  Highly recommend trying Sakana if you haven't already.  I go to the scottsdale location because its closer but the other locations do also have teppan tables!  The scallop nigiri, house smoked salmon nigiri, sweet shrimp (ama ebi) nigiri and mackerel are must orders in my opinion.  Don't forget they have fresh wasabi for a buck, totally worth it.",

Not to this location anyway. When it came time to pay the bill, our table of 12 received an adding machine tape w/ a total of $300 at the bottom. Fine. The waiter (or rather the guy who had been standing against a wall in the dining room all night texting and whispering stuff to the waitresses) refused to tell us what amounts were what items.   Thats not how you run a business. If it hadnt been our friends bday we wouldve had it out w/ them. But in the interest of keeping her happy and having no conflict, we divided the bill evenly among our credit cards (he even came back and asked \"No one said where to put the .66.\") and couldnt get out of there fast enough.  The only reason this review is 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase the quality of the food was still superb. The service however, could use an overhaul.",

I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.   If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out.",

As a sushi snob, I felt everything we ordered (with one exception) fell a little short. If you are not a sushi snob, then this place will rock your world. The best thing we had was the garlic parmesan edamame. WOW! It was amazing. We got the spicy tuna, philadelphia, salmon skin and ahi ahi rolls. They were all good, but they just weren't great and this is judging with high standards, so they were all very good. The ahi ahi roll was very close to great - salmon skin was least favorite as it was a bit salty. But, I will say I really did like this place and I'll go back and sample other menu items, maybe I'll find something that really clicks with me!",

Husband had the lunch special which came with a salad, miso soup, sashimi and a roll. I had the sashimi salad and we ended up with so much food, we must have brought home about 2 lbs of fish. I highly recommend Sakana! We have also eaten at the other locations and they never disappoint.",

The staff was very nice even though they were obviously slammed!  I loved the topping on the spicy scallop roll, but I think the crunchy topping had an off flavor to it. May just be my taste!  Overall I thought it was definitely a great value. I had two rolls, green tea, and spicy edamame for only $17.  Thanks guys, I'll come again and get some sashimi!",

When I first walked in, it was not busy at all, maybe around 5-6 people sitting down and have lunch. I was not greeted at all by rather I grab a menu for myself and go sit at any table. Second of all, the waitress saw me and decided to go to the back and enjoy a lovely conversation in the back about g-d knows what. Third, I was never helped with any orders or asked if I wanted anything to drink. I did however see other people getting 5-star service but it just happened to be that \"today wasn't my day\".   I don't know if I'll be back because of how I was treated. On to the other restaurants around.",

    "text": "Eat and drink your heart out and chances are, you'll leave with less than $20 missing from your wallet; at least that's how I feel every time I visit Sakana.   Hidden within a random strip mall on Hayden and Indian Bend, Sakana is unassuming and I've passed by many times before actually venturing inside. Friends swore by it, so I had to give it a try. When I walked inside, I was immediately welcomed by sushi platters staring right at me.. very similar to sushi restaurants I see in SF's China Town. As weird as it seemed to stare at sushi that was either plastic or had been sitting out way too long, it did give me a good idea about what I wanted to order: everything on the menu of course. When I visit, I can roll in sushi, wash it down with plenty of sake bombs and leave with a satisfied appetite and happy pocket book.   I've been with a large group of friends as well as just a couple and it's always an enjoyable...sake-filled experience. You can't beat their happy hour. From the inexpensive sushi to the really inexpensive sake, it's a match made in sushi roll heaven.   The restaurant isn't exactly huge and I've visited when there was a line out the door. At the same time, I've also visited when I'm the only one there, so it all depends on the time of year and day of the week. The staff is very friendly and you can watch the sushi chefs working their magic at the sushi counter.   Sakana proves that you don't have to visit the finest sushi establishment in the Valley to dine on some high-end, delicious sushi. Their prices make me walk through the door and their sushi keeps me coming back for more. And the sake? Well the sake just turns the night into a whole different story in itself,",

It's a small place and we requested the first available seats; after 10 minutes we were seated at the Sushi Bar. Our chairs backed up to the kitchen entrance, which was literally two feet away.  I distinctly remember watching a basketball game during this meal, since the TVs are right in front of your face at the sushi bar.   It took forever just to get water. By the time we ordered happy hour was over and we had to pay full price. We put the order in and each roll came out at least five minutes a part. The fish was not really fresh--it looked like it had been sitting in the cooler for too long. After we had been finished for 15 minutes another roll they'd forgotten about came out. We were full. The sushi chef let us know: \"No worries, someone else will order it soon\", as he placed it on top of the cooler to sit....and sit...  I usually go into detail about each item I order, but it was so nondescript I practically forgot what we had by the time we got to the car.",

Am I paying for the styrofoam container?  Look at it this way, I'm not using your tables, Im not using your waitresses, your A/C, your bathrooms and you don't have to hire a bus boy and dishwasher to clean up after me.  I think I'm saving you money by getting \"takeout\" dummies.  The family and i used to go here quite often but ever since I got the \"take out\" fee I will be spending my money elsewhere.  Too bad because we liked this place and its very close to where I live.",

The only reason I deducted a star was because of the service, it wasn't bad but the ladies who served all seemed to have the attitude that we should know what we want and they were a tad impatient. The lady on the front door was not of the atypical Japanese service style, she was a little rude and not at all courteous. She told us to wait and we would have a table shortly, which we did. She reminded me of a character out of the Seinfeld \"Chinese restaurant\" episode! Three of us had the Daily Special Sashimi dish which was excellent.",

They have a sushi happy hour, and they have customer appreciation every Thursday.  Their sushi portions are almost excessive and I've never, ever had a bad meal there.  Denise goes out of her way to say hello to everyone,and the sushi chefs will call out their welcome as you walk through the door.  If you're looking for the typical shiney Scottsdale atmosphere, you've come to the wrong place.  Nor can you sit at the bar and sip cocktails, because there is no bar (except the sushi bar).

I should've asked what that meant because it was cooked salmon skin rolled in seaweed and rice.  It did not taste or smell good.  The waitress did not know what gluten-free beer was and brown rice was not an option.  The same 'sushi' can be found at a local grocery store.

This had 3 pieces each of: salmon, albacore tuna, Fiji albacore and lightly seared white tuna. All of the slices were very generously cut and every piece was perfectly fresh, as I have come to expect from Sakana. Even the salmon was rich and buttery, without a hint of the \"fishy\" taste that salmon so often has. The also came with miso soup, a small salad and a bowl of steamed rice.  Overall, this was a decently filling meal without leaving me with that overstuffed feeling. Everything tasted great. Plus, this is one of the healthier options you can find for a quick lunch. Oh and there's the fact that every member of the staff was absolutely delightful, welcome and helpful! Always a bonus on top of great food.",

Hmmmm, maybe I just had a bad experience and since I'm not actually sure of the cause of my upset tummy, I'll give Sakura Sushi the benefit of the doubt.  It was initially a tasty experience, reasonably priced and a cute restaurant with a friendly staff.    The food was seemed fresh, was well made and tasted good (and maybe I was just gonna have an upset tummy anyway).  We had, Hamachi nigiri, Unagi nigiri, spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll and a cucumber salad.  It was all tasty.  Only complaint that I can be sure of, though the unagi tasted great, it still had some weird bone stuff on the top... that's never happened to me before with Unagi. Oh yeah and, there were only 5 pieces in each roll but, that might have been cause we ordered off a special menu.  We were lucky to catch something like a Sunday night happy hour.  I'm not sure if that's available everynight or not but our bill was under 25$.  Nice!  Unfortunately, I don't live in AZ and even when I come back, I'll probably try another joint because this one is so far from my friends house.  We only went there because it was open until 9:30 on a Sunday night.   Probably won't see ya there.",

This fish is probably 2 to 3 days from catch. That's as good as it gets here in Arizona.  And no, they are not getting this fish from the Salt River canals.  Decor is so-so.

We had waited a little bit and the service when we walked to the corner of the bar almost had me wondering, but we settled in.  Ordered sushi and nothing else.  I tend only want to attend to Sushi spots that I know will be solid.  Sakana, you're good.  I'll be back.",

Miso soup was flavorful but way too salty.  We returned it and they poured half of it out and diluted the rest with water.  lol  This place is very good for tonkotsu ramen.

It was crowded when we arrived on a Friday night but we were quickly seated at the bar - special was Asahi and and appetizer half price - Calamari was one and special mussels the other - both excellent.  We ordered four different rolls - the scallop roll was a standout.  As I told Chris our sushi chef - it's the most I've enjoyed sushi in years.  I live in Las Vegas and sure wish there was a Sakana near me, it's really exceptional sushi",

We got a free edamame offer  :-)  Ordered a little bit of nigiri for the bait-eaters among us - the salmon was really good.  The maguro was a little off that night.  The ebi was good as always.  My wife got the Ahi Ahi roll - I tried it and thought it was a tad fishy (see 'maguro was a little off' above).  The rest of us tried Ramen - 2 spicy old school, and 1 tonkatsu. The ramen was pretty good.  Broth was nice.  The pork chatsu was really good - thick and tender and flavorful.  The egg was closer to soft boiled than soft, but not bad.  Noodles had a nice chew to them.  We all enjoyed the ramen!",

    "text": "Today (Oct. 16, 2018) my son and I went to this restaurant for lunch. We were so looking forward to trying it for the first time.  It was packed, a good sign I thought. We had to wait 15 minutes to get seated, which was not an issue.  The serve came right over and we ordered. My son ordered the Ramen soup, with a laundry list of ingredients to omit. Our server repeated again and again....but alas she brought out Katsu chicken. No problem I thought it happens. But almost 50 minutes later the soup arrived. I was annoyed to say the very least.  How in the world did they get that wrong! Four lunch parties who came after us ate and left.  We were still waiting. The owner came over twice to make sure my sushi was ok because I waited for him to get his lunch.  When it finally came out I asked for the check right away as not to wait any longer.  The owner brought the check and said...\"We took your lemonade off the check, is that alright\". I responded it certainly was not alright as we waited almost 1 hour for a bowl of noodle soup. She looked at me as if I was speaking another language and made no apology.  I told her \"as a business owner she should be ashamed at the way she handled this situation and should have removed the cost ($9.99) for the cost of his lunch\".  Suffice it to say we will not be returning again....and I will certainly spread the word about this lunch experience. BAD BUSINESS decision on her part.   I did not want to rate this restaurant with any star but if would not post otherwise.  It doesn't even deserve one star!",

    "text": "Took my daughter there for dunch.   I had the tempura and she had the Sakana from the lunch menu  We shared the edamame.    The tempura was light and fluffy with a fine mix of shrimp and veggies.   The dipping sauce was a bit on the bland side, but with the addition of soy sauce, it brought in the flavor.   I didn't try any of her nigiri, which is chef's choice.   She said it was good.  The sushi roll she didn't like.   I tried it as well.  I don't know what it was, but I would never order it.  It had some mixture of what appeared to be \"fake crab,\" which is a ground fish mixture and I don't know what else.  Ughhhh.   The edamame could have used more salt.   Rather on the bland side, but a sprinkling of salt would have helped.  I mean, what can one do to edamame??  The tempura doesn't come with rice, which can be ordered for $1.   I debated, and figured I had enough to eat with the tempura, but I am not used to eating Japanese fried food without rice.  Yes, I would go back for dinner.   I have been here prior.  I mean, adding the soy sauce to the dipping sauce isn't that big of a deal, and I'm sure not having enough salt/seasoning on the edamame is no big deal as well.   I normally don't order the Americanized sushi rolls, so I would not have ordered that version of makisushi.   I would imagine other makisushis at this restaurant are good, albeit I have no idea.   Presentation was very good as well as our service.",

We ordered about 17 rolls and splitting the checks between 5 people was pretty difficult since it was hard to put the right items in the checks. The server re did the checks about three times and was very patient with us and didn't seem annoyed at all even when we made it difficult and we all appreciated her for it. The rolls were very delicious and the price was pretty fair. If you get a sake bomb you can get an appetizer for half off. We all left satisfied and very full. over all a great time at this restaurant.",

First, we ordered some appetizers for the table and I got a glass of wine. Our appetizers came before my wine did so I had to ask if my wine was coming. Then, I had to ask for small plates for our appetizers as well as napkins. We ordered several rolls and I ordered a cooked salmon dish because I don't care for sushi. Our sushi rolls came in waves which I think is normal, but when we got our last roll and my salmon still hadn't come, I asked about it and the server forgot to put the order in. She felt bad and was apologetic which was nice, but didn't take anything off the bill for her error. Needless to say, I left hungry and had to go somewhere else to eat. That's really bad customer service in my opinion. I don't care for sushi, but my husband loves it so next time we go out for sushi, we will likely go some place else.",

When she came take my order, I asked for another minute. She came back 10 minutes later. It was not busy and there were 3 servers. Then somebody brought my sushi  A few minutes later she showed up with my salad, which is typically served before the meal not after. I told her I thought the meal came with a soup and she responded, \"oh did you want that?\" Yes, I wanted that, and it would have been nice to bring it before the meal. While finishing my meal I heard the couple next to me ask if they could please have some silverware since their food had already arrived.

I came during peak dinner time without reservation, but I was able to take the last bar seat available. Table was about 20 mins wait, is what I was told on a mid week night.  Happy hour price was very nice, I ordered a couple of rolls and enjoyed them. Nothing authentic, but still good to eat.  My surprise was noodle. Both udon and ramen. Udon dashi broth had a very good bonito flavor, unlike other udon broth from nearby restaurants in the valley, it wasn't too soy saucy, it had actual great dashi flavor to it.  Ramen (Tokyo chasu soy ramen) broth also had surprise flavor to it. Ramen noodle had nice chewing texture to it, I had to ask the manager about ramen.  One of the Sakana restaurant makes the broth and ship them to other locations in the valley. Noodle is special order for Sakana. A noodle company uses recipe especially created for Sakana restaurants group. Trust me and try once. You will know what I mean by the noodle texture.  I knew this place was here for a long time. I just never though of trying. Now I know what they serve, I might stop by here for a quick dinner whenever I feel like it.",

To start the service was so bad, our server not only forgot to put our order in, but was not refilling our water nor taking away any used dishes from our table.  Had it been busy, it might have been understandable, but there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  The sushi here is so bland it tasted like it was canned fish they wrapped in rice.  The rolls were also falling apart and very mushy.  Also got the tempura udon soup, it literally tasted like soy sauce the water downed and boiled, and added noodles and seaweed.  If you want at least semi decent food, don't bother even going here, its crap.  Sorry but I don't know why anyone would pay to eat this food.",

    "text": "Just another sushi joint that will never live up to my last two favorites. Why oh why did they have to close down?  Went here for the first time for lunch today. Service was fine, not too busy inside. Our waitress brought out waters while we looked over the menu. I think she used probably less than a quarter cup of ice because the temperature was warmer than the room, which combined with the awful taste was already putting me off. Why is it so hard to have good water in restaurants?!   We decided to try some rolls first because it's the only \"sushi\" my boyfriend will eat. One Mexican Caliente roll, and one Crunchy Eel. It took more than fifteen minutes for them to get to the table and that's not too bad.   I started with the Mexican and right off the bat it split in two, the filling left all over the plate. The rice was barely sticking together. Only the jalapeno saved this roll. The Crunchy Eel was not what I've come to enjoy. Literally all I could taste was the cream cheese, it was almost the size of a quarter. Most of the eel sauce was on the plate in a messy spill. The fact that the rolls kept falling apart was made even more a challenge considering how HUGE they make them. I've never had to take bites out of a roll before, but a whole piece would have filled my mouth making it hard to move my jaw.   Overall bland and one note rolls. I was planning on ordering more but the cream cheese left a bad taste in my mouth.   Two stars because this \"meal\" came out to $14 with tip.",

My favorite dish prepared in a  completely different manner....  We were there with a group of 7...we had invited 5 others.  My husband was kept waiting for his order quite a while after everyone had been served.  First told it would be here in just a minute.  Then the waiter came back to admit it had not even been prepared yet.  Everyone went about eating and I finally shared my dish with my husband and said we could cancel his chicken salad.  Just then it came,  so he gave it a try.  No dressing....frozen chewy chicken on top.  I gave him back the other half of my meal and we continued to share and brought the chicken home to feed to our dog.  WHAT a disappointment from a restaurant we have liked so much.  My husband quietly told the waiter to bring him the check and immediately he went to the other end of the table and asked....do you want separate tickets....which made everyone uncomfortable and reaching for their wallets.  I motioned to the waiter NO....my husband wants the bill.  It was just a BAD DAY.  Sorry to say enough bad things happened that we will move on.  We have lots of other choices in Scottsdale.  PS  And going to the ladies room was dark and dismal and the hallway was filled with things that should have been stored elsewhere.  Disappointed!!!",

Now, there are no Asian sushi chef's, no Asian gals like they used to have.  We asked if they had changed hands and they all said no, but something has changed drastically.  We will not go back again.  The sushi were these jumbo rolls that fell apart when you picked them up with chop sticks. They were not tightly wrapped.  The crab mix inside the roll was very strong tasting.  We also ordered their calamari salad that is always  or was always one of my favorites.  The dressing has changed...and not for the better.  We specifically asked for no deep fried chiles, and my husband swallowed one by accident.  There were a total of 4.  Server was inexperienced, not well trained, and I just don't understand how a restaurant that was with waiting lines all the time for lunch and dinner has managed to lose all their staff, and to change what worked so well before.  All I can think is they got greedy and didn't want to pay their staff well enough and they took off and didn't train those new chefs how to do things right. It was a bomb.  We will not return.",

The server we had was new which was no problem, I'm in the service industry and understand that being new is hard, but the service was very slow and I could tell she was frazzled. When it came to the check it showed that none of the stuff we ordered was at the happy hour price. I asked the manager about it and she told me I got incorrect information about the happy hour times and there was nothing she could do about it. The sushi was mediocre and for the price we had to pay, it was not worth it. I will never be back nor will I recommend this place to any of my clients in the area.",

Since we were just down the street, we figured that we would finally give this place a try, and see what the fuss was all about.  We got there early, and we were the only customers at that time. My wife isn't that adventurous with her sushi, and refuses to eat raw fish,  raw meat, or any other raw animal protein.  So, we opted for the old standards - California Roll and Las Vegas Roll. We also ordered the Shrimp and Crab Tempura for good measure.  We weren't exactly trying to push the envelope; we just wanted to try out this restaurant's sushi acumen  We were wholly surprised as to the delectable dishes that we were served. All were quite fresh, tasteful, and not overwrought. The addition of the fresh Wasabi added a delicate, spicy hot touch to our meals.  It was definitely a treat to have partaken of Sakana's offerings, and we've been back several times ever since.",

This ia another one. The dishes here are bright and beautiful, well put together with the simple style that is Japanese.  The menu is full of classics and if you dare to venture off of it they try to accommodate. Service was professional and held it all together when it was packed and out the door waiting. Last words...fresh wasabi, you deserve it.",

The sushi bar was packed but we were able to get a table in the restaurant which it only took 15-20 min before the entire restaurant was full. If you want the bar definitely come earlier this place gets hoppin! Our server was super attentive and got us fresh glasses for our saki bombs throughout our stay and made sure we had everything we needed. Nice dimmed ambiance with fun music. Great Friday night spot just what we were in the mood for. I ordered the Vegas roll and my bf ordered the rainbow roll and spicy salmon roll which we obviously shared let's be honest, ha. I believe the owner nice lady stopped by towards the end to ask how everything was. Clearly fabulous the saki was hitting me at that time....full, happy and will be back, thanks Sakana!",

Also very yummy was the Sahara Rainbow Roll:  shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, tuna, smoked salmon, yellowtail, habenero panzu sauce and wasabi mayo. OMG! So yummy if you are in the area - you need to stop!!!!  Soooo good!",

It's a little farther away from me, so I wouldn't consider making the drive just to go back and have sushi again.  Once again, nothing really wrong, but also nothing really memorable.  The sushi rolls were not well constructed meaning that when you dip a piece in soy sauce, it tended to fall apart pretty easily.  When I was an exchange student in Japan, my host brother was a sushi chef.  He explained to me the art of having the roll nicely tucked while not squishing the rice.  Since that time, I've been more critical of how well the sushi is rolled.  Although this place was given a \"heads up\" of our large group, they didn't seem to be quite prepared for us.  What does that mean to you?  If you're in a hurry, this probably is not the place to go.  If you don't mind spending a decent amount of time for a meal, this place will work for you.",

I noticed they started adding more entrees on their menu which is awesome; we love trying new things. However, we decided to go with our favorites on this visit. Their sashimi is not the best I had, but it'll do to satisfy my cravings. The lunch sashimi combo is very good value as well. They tend to overdo on the sauces on their sushi rolls so ask for easy on the sauce or no sauce. Their ramen is delish! It is my son's go to dish whenever we are here. The Hamachi Kama is also good. Just remember it takes almost 30 minutes because it's a thick cut of fish. Enjoy!",

It's huge, tasty and priced right.   Most sushi places take a glob of sticky rice, slice a thin piece of fish, and daintily place the rawness onto the rice.  Not at Sakana.  Here the sushi chef cuts a steak size piece of fish, thick and long, like a slab of prime rib.  Then, he DRAPES the fish over the rice.  When he's done, you can't even see the rice.    Once I told the waitress \"Excuse me Miss.  I ordered Nigiri, which is supposed to have rice.  This is sashimi.\" \"Silly customer.\" she replied. \"We give you Nigiri. Rice under fish. Look. Look.\" She was right!  There was some rice under all that fish. Don't believe me? Look at the photo I uploaded.  If you ever want to totally chow down on a ton of sushi, this is the place to go.  The quality of the fish is pretty good: not the best. But the portions are out of sight.  Do yourself a favor.  Order the \"Baked Scallop Roll\", it's one of the best I've ever had. Arigato.",

I've never been disappointed here.  I've also never come here outside of happy hour. It's later in the day, which is good for people with, you know, jobs and real lives. I can still come here for dinner after a day at work/school and still save big with their happy hour menu! And they have this great special when you buy a large Kirin, you can get an appetizer for $1. How sweet is that?! I usually opt for the edamame or calamari (be careful, it has jalapenos). Some of my favorite rolls beyond the daily specials are the rainbow (can't go wrong there) and the scallop bomb. Really rich dishes, and very filling! I've never walked away from this place without having to unbutton my shorts because literally everything on the menu is good.... and good on the wallet :) I can't tell you how many times I've been here, and will keep coming back!",

The calamari was crisp and mixed with fried jalapeno peppers. The sauce compliments the fried calamari extremely well. The spring rolls were very crisp, and very fresh.  For our main course we ordered a variety of sushi rolls. All were very good with the exception of one of their specials. The Case Blanca contained great amounts of fish, but the sauce did not compliment well. It left an odd taste on our pallets.   The rainbow roll, soft shell crab, spicy tuna and baked scallop rolls were our tables favorites. All are unique in flavor, but contain extremely fresh fish. We will certainly order all again, and recommend ordering.   Service - the service was terrific. Our waitress had great advice, and pointed out several cost saving tricks while ordering, She had great knowledge and was completely on top of all our tables needs. The sushi came out quickly and all of the food was well timed.   Ambience - the restaurant is small and very loud. It was packed on a Wednesday night. Recommend for small groups. With only a dozen tables, it will not accommodate large groups well. The metal roof leads to a lot of noise. It was ver hard to have a conversation in the restaurant.   With sushi restaurants on every block, Sakana holds its own. The quality and prices are great!",

They make the sushi fresh after you order so plan on being there for about an hour for lunch.",

Since I can't find the originals anywhere on Yelp, I write a second review. I don't feel like writing two reviews for each place. Sometimes the second review is gone, too. Why is this happening? I even took a picture of my roll at Sakana and uploaded it to Yelp, but that is gone, too. Am I not looking in the right place??  I went here for lunch with my bestie on March 20. I had read good reviews and we both love sushi! I ordered the Vegas roll (my favorite anywhere except at Geisha) edamame, and the lunch special. Both were very good, especially the sashimi. The waitress (I wish I had asked hre name) was excellent. She was attentive, came to the table when needed, stayed away just enough and was very nice.  The portions are so generous that I had lots of food left over. I took it home and feasted after waking up hungry. I WILL be back!",

If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go.",

The only 2 downfalls are that it is small so we have to get there a few minutes before their 5:30pm dinner opening time or else wait until later in the evening and it's decor is a bit dated.  Either way it's worth the wait. The staff is awesome & everyone who walks in gets a friendly greeting from the guys behind the sushi bar. Their creative rolls are delicious but be careful because some can get to be a bit expensive (the Fitzgeroll is $18.99).  The rolls are always a good size, not small like some of the \"chain restaurants\" around town.  I will recommend this place to anyone looking to have good sushi.",

So in my research of finding restaurants that serve such this item I stumbled across Sakana.    From my first bite, I was in love.  The Hamachi lived up to its reputation!  A nice size piece of fish, grilled to perfection.  I devoured this dish and could ate about two more servings of this.  I also ordered some sushi pieces as well.  The sushi was standard issue.  It wasn't mindblowingly good, but it was not terrible.  It totally satiated my appetite.    The inside is a quaint and cute little place.  I'd say it would probable sit around 50 people.  The decor, is nothing too fancy, but it's not bland either, just the right mix.  They offered several different lunch specials and the portions were huge for the price.  Also they have two lists of special appetizers.  They have several items that are $.50 cents each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  And they have several items that are $1.00 each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  That's nice if you're curious to try something new.  What's an extra either 50 cents or a buck?    All in all, just go for the Hamachi Kama.  I will be back for sure just for this one item!",

Both our orders got salad, but only one rice and no soup at all. The dressing for the salad was bitter and weird. Even the salad pieces were bitter.   The Pork Cutlet was okay, but it was on the dry side. And the tonkatsu sauce wasn't that good. I'm not sure if they make it themselves, or they buy it. The tempura batter was a little thick and not that great. Making pork cutlet and tempura isn't that hard, I don't know how they went wrong with that.  Maybe they're only known for their sushi.

The other three were pretty disgusting.  They were made sloppily, everything had TONS of mayo and not enough spice.  They smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon, which leads me to believe it's not very fresh, and it makes for a very mushy texture.  The miso soup was good, at least...  Anyway, they turned on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finished paying.  Sorta rude.  As a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time, I think that if you take tables until 9:30, you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.  Otherwise close earlier and don't take the table.  I'm NEVER going back here,  Ew.",

Comes with 4 different types of fish, a side of rice and a small salad! You know it's a good place when I look around and find the same people who come for lunch everyday too! Service was amazing, super attentive and helpful for when I bring guests who don't know what they want!",

The glass doors were filthy, and not like they were just skipped that day with a few fingerprints- it's like they had not been wiped down since opening day.   I sat at the sushi bar, which was also kind of sticky like the floor in a cheap strip club. The TV in front of the bar had visible splatters on it (also like a cheap strip club...), again denoting how well this crew was cleaning things around here. You could see the soda machine/waitress area behind the bar- with a very classy half empty bottle of rum, noticeably absent from the bar's alcohol selection. There were 2 staff eating and watching YouTube videos next to us at the bar while 4 guys 'worked' behind the bar, 2 waitresses 'waiting', and a mopey middle aged manager- all extremely unenthused, as if they were attempting to spread their defeated attitude to others.   Before my order was placed, one of the waitresses pointed to a seating at the bar and told the unimpressive manager that a couple had walked out without paying (by the way, the food and beer was barely touched- again, I should have taken note here and walked away!). The manager huffed and said loudly 'whatever' - letting the entire restaurant know just how little pride he takes in the place (as if we couldn't deduce this from the state of the establishment he has found himself in charge of).  What, he just couldn't make the cut for the DMV? I digress...  We chose this spot for lunch b/c it had a 4.5 star google review, so I was holding out hope that at least the food would be good.  Wrong!  I've never had such a colorful plate of food taste like nothing.  To call this sushi mediocre would be high praise. No edamame or miso soup to start and nobody eager to take my order. The presentation of the sushi was okay I guess, but at one point when I was handed a dish I was immediately asked to return it because they forgot something- the toppings. Please keep in mind, they were not busy. Maybe 3 other tables of 2. Mostly the food was bland and blah. Although I literally spit out a piece of nigiri bc it tasted like anchovies- which again should of sent me running, but no!  I was in too deep- committed. And the most outraging aspect was the rice! Rice at a sushi joint is supposed to be sticky, to clump together under your yummy pieces of delicious raw fish. Well not here- the rice under the nigiri all just fell apart, making it impossible to eat with the provided (cheap) chop sticks.  So knock yourselves out if you'd like a disappointing meal served in a sticky environment served by unmotivated staff!",

They have an excellent Happy Hour menu that goes all day during the week. Most of the main stay sushi choices are included as well (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, etc.). The sushi rolls were pretty big and very fresh for the price you pay. The dining room feels a little small when it gets crowded, but it's a nice location. Definitely will go back again soon!",

Don't waste your money or your time in any other restaurant!  I absolutely love the food and the staff here. Can't believe how amazing their happy hour prices, rolls, and specialty items are. An awesome neighborhood vibe.   I keep coming back for more.   It's also the perfect perch when dining alone-- the sushi chefs are so kind; they actually get to know their customers, inquire about their lives since the last time they saw you. And they teach you about how to choose sushi! For example, don't order a roll with tempura at the same time as the other ones so as to avoid it getting soggy. As an LA high maintenance foodie: THANK YOU!  People dining alone bring books to read or gawk at any sports game playing on the tvs behind the sushi bar. Point is, you won't feel the slightest bit awkward about shoving your face with raw fish on a Mon night because you're surrounded with other like minded peeps.  The cute waitresses are like your best buddies; ready to flirt, gripe, or entertain you with humorous quips.   Sashimi, sashimi, sashimi... Insanely perfect on a big plate. Happy hour? Go for the Asahi and add a 99cent seaweed salad. Excellent deal!  Man, I love this place!",

It's great quality sushi, large portions compared to other sushi in this town, decent service, and casual.  Yes, casual.  We were all in gym clothes and no one looked us up and down.  It was great!  The garden salad with ginger dressing is like 3 x the size you get at other places.  The rolls are big and filling and the sashimi comes with plenty of fish!  Caution on spicy items:  IE spicy tuna and spicy salmon - you might want to tell them light on the spice... I usually like spicy but I think tonight's sushi chef has a heavy hand!  Nothing better than the complimentary fresh sliced orange and whipped cream to end your meal here either... it was worth the wait!",

The fish is fresh, firm and delicious - never fishy, spongy or just ok.   The toro tuna sashimi literally melts in your mouth, and the salmon, yellowtail and friends are all excellent.   The REST: The prices are extremely reasonable for such wonderful food. The service is consistently great, as well - I tend to ask a lot of questions and they've never steered me wrong. The atmosphere is dark and quiet - quite a nice departure from the club-like, house music and noise of some really good sushi places.",

It stands out among the other sushi offerings in the valley because it has, in my opinion,  - The most generous sushi portions you can find in Scottsdale and the Valley. The cuts are amazing, fresh, and expertly prepared. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. It is the freshest, loveliest fish you can imagine.  - Really, really good rice, all the time. Sushi rice is tricky. Sakana's rice is just sticky enough to be cohesive, but each grain is distinct from its neighbor, sitting like little oblong pearls. Sakana's rolls are wrapped rice-side out, which I feel makes it a much lovelier experience than rice-side in, as the outer rice is not unnecessarily compressed.   - Lovely service, at the bar and at the table. I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy. You can't fake happy for that long! Even though the restaurant is usually full, the wait for a table is never excessive and, once you're seated, the service is prompt and friendly.  - Good prices. You'll spend 25% less on sushi / sashimi and 40% less on beer and sake here than you will at Stingray, Sushi Brokers, Sapporo, and most other sushi places around. It's actually a great bargain for the quality you get - and that is just the regular menu. I also enjoy the Happy Hour roll specials on weekdays, as well as the $1.50 appetizer add-on to an order of Kirin beer. Ask for your \"I Love Sakana\" card to take advantage of the loyalty program. Check in with Yelp and get your bowl of edamame! You can eat like a king, and not pay a king's ransom... so you can come back next weekend and do it all over again.",

We were seated sooner & greeted by our waiter JT promptly. Our drink orders were taken (green tea). Between 3 of us we ordered 5 rolls, 2 sashimi orders & an edamame. There was plenty of food. We had the Philly roll, Las Vegas roll, scallop dynamite roll, caterpillar roll & eel crunch roll. All were tasty, except none of us were a fan of the Las Vegas roll (to much rice & small portion of fish) The place was packed but didn't seem that noisy. Overall my experience was good, food was good, atmosphere was good, service was good & I would return.",

    "text": "I visited Sakana twice in the past week.. On both occasions I stopped there because it was on the way home from my running errands, and because I was craving Sushi. I had been there a few months earlier, and remembered that their sushi was good (not great), that the prices were reasonable, and that their portions were generous.  On both of my visits this week I sat at the Sushi Bar because sushi service tends to be faster than when you are seated at a table, and because I like to watch the prepared sushi as it is passed to the waitresses and to those seated at the sushi bar. On both occasions, I was seated at the sushi bar immediately, and my beverage and miso soup were delivered very quickly. (The miso soup is just ok.) On both visits, my servers were very friendly, and were great about answering questions, and explaining how to place my sushi orders when I was ready.  On my first visit, I ordered the Mackerel (Saba) Nigiri special, and from the happy hour menu, Salmon Roe (Ikura), and two Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. My order was served to me quickly. I enjoyed the Mackerel, and the Salmon Roe. Everything tasted fresh.   I was a bit disappointed with my Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. Although the portion of spicy tuna in each hand roll was very generous, the seasoning was lacking in general, and there was not even a suggestion of heat at all. I ended up adding wasabi and soy sauce to it for flavor. The tuna flavor was obscured by the mayonnaise (or whatever mayonnaise like substance) that was used to make the spicy tuna. it is not a preparation that I care for, although I realize many sushi places are doing it that way now. I prefer spicy tuna that is just tuna, hot oil, and a bit of seasoning.  That said, for what I paid, I wouldn't complain. I left full, and the basic standard of good was met overall.  On today's visit, I really was up for variety. After asking a few questions, I ordered the Sakana Lunch, which came with miso soup, 6 different pieces of Nigiri, a California roll and a spicy crab jalapeno popper. Once again, the miso soup (again, just ok) was brought to me right away. My lunch also came out very quickly, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was quite busy.   While the fish was fresh and tasty, and it was MORE than enough food (I skipped the Nigiri rice and just ate the fish in order to finish my food), the California roll was pretty bad. It was fresh enough, but between too much rice, fake \"krab\", and too much mayonnaise - or whatever the binder was - it tasted pretty bad, and lacked any sort of balancing fresh note. I didn't even try to finish it. I felt like I got my money's worth, and once again I was full. It was still a long way from a great dining experience.   I also stayed away from many of the rolls because most include that awful fake \"krab\".  I'd say that Sakana is ok as long as your expectations are not too high. The service was friendly and fast, the prices were reasonable, most of the food was ok, and it was convenient. This just isn't on my list of favorite sushi places.  The cooked food may be good. I've never tried it..  It is also important to note that they close between lunch and dinner (2:00 pm - 5:30 pm)",

    "text": "As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.  While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time.   Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.  Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.  Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special.   If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.  For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.",

The rice is right.  The sushi is fresh.   This can hardly seem like a complaint, but I have concluded that their portions are just too damned big. It is very disappointing to leave pieces of a roll on your plate that won't fit into your mouth, and I refuse to dissect it. I ordered tamago, among other things, and the pieces were easily 4\" by an inch thick and would have taken four bites to eat each piece... That's just crazy.  The hamachi nigiri was three bites.  Order accordingly.",

So not only does your sushi suck you try to silence  your customers that are taking their time to provide constructive criticism in a form of a review.  The sushi that I had was not fresh. Others have reviewed that their sushi was NOT fresh. If multiple people are saying your seafood is not fresh then it is not fresh.   I was born in and spent a lot of my life in a fishing village off the Mediterranean Sea with a family full of fishermen. I also served in the United States Coast Guard and served in Boston and and more than aware of the seafood coming from there and how it should look like. I am more than qualified to know what fresh seafood is and what is not. I am also qualified to know what is real seafood and what is not. Imitation crab meat is NOT real seafood.  I even took into consideration and lowered my standards a bit cause we are--after all in the desert.  Your sushi was not even \"fresh for Arizona\".",

I ordered salmon roe (ikura) and mackerel (saba) - the two items I get (if possible) whenever I go out for sushi. I usually order a dragon roll as well but for whatever reason Sakana doesn't have one. v_v. The rest of the group ordered yellowtail, salmon, tuna, some tofu and a few rolls. They got their order fairly quick but mine was delayed for some reason. I had to ask on two separate occasions where my sushi was before they finally brought it out.  The first time (about fifteen minutes after sushi came) she apologized for the wait and said she would check. About ten minutes later I asked again and received the same response. Roughly seven or eight minutes after that, I got my sushi.  The salmon roe was good - delicious and salty, just the way I like it (I like to taste fish when I eat fish, go figure). The mackerel, however, was very bland... almost tasteless. I am not used to mackerel being so nondescript so that really threw me off. There was quite a bit of fish on my rice so I appreciate the amount they gave me, but a whole lot of mediocre is still mediocre.  Overall it was a decent sushi experience for the price but there are much better places around town. Probably won't be visiting again for some time. Though I will say it was nice to hear Drake while we ate. (Kind of.)",

First, the bad: on Friday night I met some friends at 7:30 -- we were a party of 4 and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being over an hour, due to a couple of large parties just camping out after the bill had been paid. Keep in mind, this is a small restaurant. It would have been appreciated if the staff could have dropped subtle hints to these patrons that there was a slew of people waiting for their tables.   Otherwise, the sushi is very tasty. The soft-shell crab roll is my personal favorite, and at around $9, an indicator that this place is easy on the wallet. Portions are large. Service has been consistently fast and friendly. The decor is simple and nothing ornate, making it feel like a nice  family restaurant. People were dressed in anything from gym attire to business casual.   Sakana is on the top of my mind when I think of going out for sushi in Phoenix.",

There be a whole lot of sushi goin on.  Good times, good people and great sushi.  Order anything it really doesnt matter as everything is done at a very high level.   If you really want to get crazy then have Masa make you his special spicy sauce to go along with some of your rolls.  Its legit.  Not for the weak however...  The service in this establishment is great as well I must admit. Overall this place is a big time winner for sushi.",

Pretty good sushi for the prices.  They serve oranges at the end too. Good sushi and great location right off hayden. No issues with parking.",

The one time I came here, i was waiting about an hour before seating, but stayed for almost 2 hours.  So this place does fill up quickly on weekends.  If you are looking to try newer or just better tasting sushi and apps, come here!",

    "text": "Amazing!  I was in Phoenix on a business trip with a couple of colleagues and I decided on Sakana based on the Yelp reviews. Although, it was a good 20 min drive from where we were staying in Phoenix, it was WELL worth the trip.  The restaurant is not very big, so even on a Tues night, we had to wait about 10-15 mins for a table.  The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive.  We all started with a Kirin Ichiban bomber with a small side of hot sake (Yes, it was a combo offering!)  With it, you would also get an appetizer for only 50 cents!  We took advantage of the specially priced \"Sakana designer rolls\" for customer appreciation nights (otherwise called Mon-Thurs evenings).  In addition, we also got some maguro nigri sushi, dynamite roll, eel roll, and an order of mixed tempura.  In all, we probably had over 60 pieces of sushi and plenty other Asian culinary delights.  The quality of the sushi and other food was amazing.  The best part, our entire bill came to $90... at least 40% less than we were expecting (or what you would expect to pay just about anywhere else).  I will DEFINITELY return on my next visit to the Phoenix area!",

    "text": "After all the hype on yelp, I decided to check this place out.    We arrrived at 8PM.  No line on a Tuesday.  When we entered, there was more light outside than inside the restaurant.  I had to totally readjust my pupils - but that didn't happen.    So right off the bat, I'll give this place a thumbs up to take a potentially 'ugly' blind date.  Seriously, I couldn't read the menu, see what kind of faces were in the crowd, much less see my childhood friend's lovely face.  I felt dizzy.    We ordered the tofu adage, soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna roll, salmon nigiri, and shrimp tempura roll.  We were STuFFED.  The food was very tasty, but maybe a bit too tasty- but that's personal preference.  I prefer light flavor, dainty size bites (savoring the natural flavors), but they serve huge size rolls....... the kind you try to bite in half, but it all falls apart, so you have to put the whole thing in your mouth, and you chew it for 5 minutes - and all this happens as  your friend starts to ask you a question.  All this was done as if I was blind-folded :)  It's a decent place.  Romantic for a date, authentic in local but also americanized flavors.  it was very good for the price and portions.  Not sure if I'd make the trip again, but yelp didn't allow 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the \"main\" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.  $7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.  Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.  Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!",

Don't have to rush to get there before 7 like most places. Very nice staff, big rolls, great lunch specials. If you want great sushi without the Old Town Scottsdale scene than this is the place to be. Highly recommended. Their portions seem to be much bigger than most so keep in mind when ordering.",

This place is more for \"Americanized\" rolls, which aren't too bad, and they have interesting combos, so I'll bump it up a 1/2 star for creativity.
