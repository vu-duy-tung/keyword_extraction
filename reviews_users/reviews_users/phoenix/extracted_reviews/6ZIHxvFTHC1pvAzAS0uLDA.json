    "text": "I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!",

Andrew Zimmern(BIzzare foods fame) is a pansy  and thus, what I usually saunter in for is their Durian shake.  So if you visit this place and suddenly smell some noxious fumes , look around for a daffy, grinning bloke holding a shake.  For 3 bucks their sandwiches are awesome (only cash please... wha.??!!). Overall in the grand cosmic view of things actually \"Meh\". Barbeque pork is my fave but have tried most of their other varieties as well.  I 've nailed down the reason for me liking the sandwich to the pickled daikon and carrots as well as their eggy mayo that they lather in, topped with their fresh cilantro.  The meat used has always been rather tough and unappetizing.   However they have way more choices in terms of desserts smoothies baguettes. The ambience is very similar to a fast food joint in HK, South Korea etc.",

    "text": "AMAZING Vietnamese sandwiches!!!! the BEST in Phoenix! They bake their own baguettes, which is the reason why the place always smells so delish. I always order #11, which is the most authentic Vietnamese sandwich. It includes mayonnaise, pate, variety of cold cuts. I've taken people here and they all love #11. And above all, this place is absolutely CLEAN! This is rare in lots of asian restaurants (unfortunately). I give this place 4.5 because most of the times the baguettes get pretty hard. I've had it when the baguette was fresh, just came out and it was melt-in-your-mouth kind of crunchy. I would come here any time of the day, any day of the week! Cash only!",

But a damn cool one at that.    How many places have a Baguette factory pumping out fresh baguettes every 30 minutes?  Yeah, they aren't MJ Bread quality, but hoo ya momma, they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and yum good!  I ordered a lemondade (hand made, caused a delay, three orders behind me got their sammiches first), but it was fresh and tasty, though smallish (12oz with ice?).  And the funny part was the only Vietnamese in the place (18-19 year old girl) running the cash register warned me that my shredded pork (#8) had fish sauce on it and it was 'an acquired taste!'  I loved it.  The first time I had fish sauce I was in love.    The only other sandwich shop that hit me in the yummer like this one was Birley's on Market Street in SFO.    I wish it was closer to home!",

    "text": "I will start by saying that my favorite part of Lee's is by far the french baguettes. Being an east coast transplant, it's hard to find good bread (by which I mean chewy interior, crusty-but-not-stale exterior). This place has done a great job and I will likely return just for that.  I tried the bahn mi, since it seems to be a house specialty, and I found it lacking flavor. The Roast Beef & Cheese was better, although I tasted cheese more than the thin amount of roast beef they put on. Next time I'd order extra meat. I can't complain at the prices either, $3-$5 for a sandwich is good, and $1.25 for a baguette to take home is better than local grocery stores in price and flavor.  Thanks to those who warned about no refills (I went to Circle K across the street for a soda) and the cash only environment.",

The food is ridiculously cheap, but you wouldn't know that just from eating it - you'd have to go to the establishment itself, where the various cost saving measures become obvious. The ambience is non-existent (you might as well be sitting in the middle of a supermarket eating), but it's clean and quick. As others have said, the baguettes are absolutely delicious, but the drink, meats, and vegetables are wonderful as well.

    "text": "I always make it a point to visit Lee's Sandwiches everytime I'm in AZ.  Luckily my family lives in Chandler and just a few blocks from Lee's.    Sandwiches always taste fresh here.  I normally order a few sandwiches for me and the family.  My favorite is the special combo #11.  Others we've tried are the regular Lee's combo #1, grilled pork #5, BBQ pork #6, and their ham & cheese croissant.  You can opt to have the veggies on the side.    They bake their bread onsite, so it always tastes fresh.  The last time I visited AZ, the #11 sandwich was $2+ each, but when I went by today, it was up to $3.05.  Still, that's cheap for a filling sandwich.  The #5 and #6 are $2.85 each.  They have hot food items for sale off to the right of the registers, such as steamed pork buns, which are $1.75 each.  Thai iced teas (no boba) are $2.55 each.   The place is clean and their employees serve you with a smile.    Luckily, there are no Lee's Sandwiches near my house in L.A.; the closest one is about 30 miles.  Otherwise, I would be eating one everyday!    Parking can be hard to find during busy hours, but you can always park at the Walgreens lot next door.",

Lee's Sandwiches is a familiar face and staple from home, the Bay Area CA.  I was impressed to see that they had expanded their market into AZ (they have over 10 locations in the Bay Area alone!) and happy to have a taste of home nearby.  As per their usual setup there's a machine rolling out fresh baguettes while you wait.  The sandwich varieties is extensive though I always go with the traditional banh mi pate.  The fresh dishes they have saran-wrapped in the front are a must as well.  You can even take 10 baguettes home for a $1!!! Ridiculous but True.  This particular Lee's also has desserts - they have a bunch of bobas and frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend, just bring cash as they don't do card.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Lee's was in California while looking at wedding dresses for my sister nearly 2 years ago. It was lunchtime and we were not far from one. She suggested it, as she had been there several times. I had never had a banh mi sandwich, so she ordered what she liked best. #5, the Grilled Pork. It was a while ago, and I only remembered that it was yum.   I've lived in the Phoenix area for 4 years and I didn't know there was a Lee's here until several months ago I was in the Costco parking lot at Cave Creek & Loop 101. There was a tattered, torn and dirty Lee's bahn mi paper bag on the ground. What?!? Lee's?!? Here?!? I looked it up online, and sure enough, there was a Lee's in Arizona. But in Chandler, an hour away from home.   The mister and I just purchased a home in North Phoenix in June and needed a washer/dryer. Instead of purchasing new, we Craiglisted for a decent nice set. Lucky me, I found a set worth the drive to Chandler. Right down the street from Lee's. I really wanted to go, but was skeptical because Louie is more tentative with trying new foods (although he's doing a lot better at that now). He agreed and we went. It was fantastic and Louie loved it. I think this trip we both had the #10, Cured Pork and Pork Roll. The meat is thinly sliced and has the perfect saltiness to match the sweetness of their special mayo, tangy & crisp pickled veggies, with a bit of spice from jalapenos (I had mine with no onions). The French baguette was perfect. We were able to stuff ourselves for less than $10 including fountain drinks.  The staff is great. The following weekend we made another trip to the area, to Ikea. Since we were already this far, Lee's was added to the itinerary, so our friend could try it out. Louie thought the #11 Special Combo sounded good, so he ordered it. The young lady that took our order was nice enough to ask if he knew what was in it. Headcheese. I'm not a big foodie, so I didn't know what it was exactly. Not cheese. She gave him a sample and it's a good thing she did. He is not a fan of headcheese. LOL.   The place is clean, has a huge dining area, a bakery counter and an ice cream counter, I think....? No one was at the other counters, so I didn't take a good look. I've yet to have them, but the smoothies and boba drinks look yum, so next time I'll give them a try. The only downside is that we are debit card people and they are cash only. But well worth the trip to an ATM (or to Walgreens next door for a cash-back purchase)!",

Maybe it's because it's not in San Jose. Maybe I feel that having a Lee's in Mesa is a betrayal of my 408 roots, ya know? Or, maybe I'm just a basket case. I like to think it's a combination of the two.  I'll clear my head and say it IS good, but just not as good as the one in San Jose...or Milipitas. Yea, I went there.  I like that the bread is baked on site and I love that I've got a tiny bit of Vietnamese sandwiches here in Mesa. :)  Ok, I talked myself into it - I'm going to go have a Lee's Sandwich for dinner.",

The sandwiches at Lee's cost half as much, are much more flavorful and interesting than the chain sub places, AND their bread is about a billion times better. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, you better believe we bought an extra baguette (for $1) to take with us after we ate our sandwiches.  On my first visit, I had the grilled chicken asian sandwich, and while I wouldn't describe the meat portion as huge, the bread to condiment to meat ratio was spot on. The sandwiches come with some sort of mayo-like spread, your meat of choice, and veggies including cilantro, carrot, and raw jalapenos. I like my food on the spicy side, so I enjoyed the jalapenos, but they do add some heat to the sandwich.   Why go for bland Subway when you can get something way more interesting and fresh for less? Give Lee's a try; your comatose tastebuds and your wallet will thank you.  Edit: Returned to Lee's last weekend and decided to be adventurous this time. I tried the combination (#11) sandwich, and after assuring the cashier that I knew what I was getting into (namely, head cheese), I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. The combination of headcheese and pate provided a unique texture and flavor experience that was anything but mundane (at least to a girl with no prior head cheese experience).",

I'm somewhat of a sandwich nut, I've driven to beyond bread in Tucson just to have a sandwich, more than once.  This is my favorite place in phoenix, period!  I wish they had more of these around like in Cali but I don't mind the drive to chandler.  The place itself is pretty nice, well lit and adequately decorated, creating an easy going atmosphere.  They only take cash, which is sometimes very annoying, but that's the only thing bad about this place.    the menu is pretty divers, many sandwich items are available.  Most of them are Vietnamese style, but there are some cross cuisine items as well.  Most authentic and my favorite is probably numbers 4 and 5, but you couldn't go wrong with trying a new sandwich every time you go there.  They have a bakery built in, so the bread is amazing, always fresh and crunchy.  If you just want to go pickup a baguette, you can.  All their sandwiches consist of a foot long baguette sliced down the middle, sub style.  Then filled with your meats, pickled radishes and carrots, and then topped off with a little cilantro and jalapenos.  If you like it less spicy just take the damn jalapenos out!  They also have amazing drinks, decent desserts, and pretty yummy appetizers.  I recommend you try their chicken wings, very crispy and delicious but a bit oily.    The price is what makes this place amazing, pretty much all the items are between 2.50-4$.  The sandwiches are pretty filling as well, making it an unbeatable combo.  You guys should try it out, won't be disappointed.",

I equate this to people who have no other available option and just don't know what a good banh mi should taste like....so they rate this truly sub-par place with a crazy 5 star review. I ordered my go-to combination banh mi, the #11. They barely put enough meat and/or pickled veggies in their sandwiches. When I opened my banh mi up, I was like What the heck is this?? Their saving grace is their baguettes, ca phe sua da (strong Vietnamese iced coffee) and other sweet treats they offer. Eggrolls are meh. Their banh mi's, no. Macaroons, no. Haven't had their boba yet, so I can't comment. But for a place specializing in banh mi's, they really could try just a liiiiitle harder.  Oh, and I am always skeptical about places that only accept cash. Like, really? You conveniently have an ATM inside? Sure, let me pay $3-5 dollars in bank/ ATM fees on top of my order JUST so I can pay you. Because you don't accept debit/credit cards.",

    "text": "Came here straight from the airport in need of some strong coffee and a sandwich to kick off our house hunting trip. I have been wanting to visit a Lee's for a long time but could never seem to get there until now. It was worth the wait and now that I am moving to Chandler, I can go whenever I want!!  I am a huge fan of banh mi and my husband likes them too but is new to the concept. So I ordered him the grilled pork vietnamese sandwich and ordered myself a pork and pate one. The combo sandwich I wanted was not available but this did not dampen my experience. The bread the sandwiches are served on is special. Its creamy, flavorful, soft on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.  Of course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon. Next time I would order a large one because they really pack the cup full of crushed ice (this makes it nice and cold) so you don't get as much coffee.",

The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well.

I enjoyed the vegan sandwich and the price was good, but I was completely inconvieneced by the fact that they do not accept visa. I also own a small business and as much as we do not like paying the credit card fees, we do it to provide a service for our customers. To add insult to injury, they pride themselves on the fact that they have an ATM for their customers to get cash from. So if they have the ATM, they also get paid to have that in their shop, but their customers have to pay an out of network fee to use the machine! This is ridiculous. I placed my order over the phone and was clear that I was not familiar with the menu (a new customer) at that point the person should have informed me that they do not accept credit cards! I opted to leave and get cash from my own bank to pay for my to go order. I probably will not be back after this. I feel like companies that deal in all cash avoid paying taxes and do not help the system that they are benefiting from in this country. So not happy",

    "text": "As Sarah B notes in her review of this place, colonialism bad, impact of the chocolate and peanut butter sort of mesh of french and Vietnamese cuisine, amazing. As for Lee's  Banh mi (french baguette stuffed with various sorts of meats and vegetables), they seem to actually take a full size baguette and cut it in half for the sandwich whereas in most places I go they use a small mini-baguette, which I have to say, I prefer a bit more but for the price (my sandwich was like $3.50) I'm not going to complain too much and maybe it's more of a case of what I expect from a sandwich. If I took price into account I might go 4 starts but I wanted to focus purely on the experience of the food and that means, I would eat it again but if I could get one in the more traditional fashion, even if it cost me a bit more, I would go for that type Vietnamese sandwich.  What I did like is that one can also order full size baguettes at the same time the sandwich is ordered and like the sandwiches, quite inexpensive at only $1.25 each. I bought one and started eating it on the way home (yes, I know, crumbs everywhere but that is why they have those vacuums at the car wash). I could see picking up a loaf or two of this bread every weekend as I like the crunchy crust and the wonderfully soft interior of their loafs.  I also had an iced mint milk and well, that was rather blah, tasted overly sweet and artificial so not something I would order again but they have a lot of other options.  Bottom line....the bread is great, the sandwiches a great deal if you are looking for value for your money and an okay deal if you are looking for the highest quality Vietnamese sandwich. I would check out the Tea Light Cafe at Scottsdale 101 if you want to try a really good Vietnamese sandwich.",

I really don't care for the cash only policy, but I understand it helps keep those prices at a rock bottom level. Personal pet peeve.  The baguette they use is chewy and toothsome, but there was way too much of a bread-to-filling ratio for my tastes. All the meaty bits they toss in there are also pretty fantastic. If you think you don't like head cheese or liver pate, try the number one and get back to me. It's got both in spades and manages to stay delicious. The cilantro and veggies they toss on the sammich also balance it all into a harmonious French-Vietnamese delight.  Too bad it's in Chandler. The valley seriously needs more banh mi and less pho.",

I don't recommend the white folks sandwiches though.  On occasion I have bought loafs of their freshly baked baguettes. This place is cash only. They recently upped the prices on their sandwiches by $0.20, that won't stop me from coming.  Lee's also offer pastries and ice cream.  I'll be coming until my wife finally gets done with school. I won't miss Phoenix, but I will miss Lee's!",

    "text": "This is the kind of place that if it weren't for yelp, I probably never would have come here. I live literally right down the street from this place, and have driven by it about 30 times over the last two years. It always looks busy but I never had any desire to try this place. You see, I am a creature of habit. I will eat at the same five restaurants for months because I know there is something on the menu I can eat, and like. I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first. Thanks to yelp, and reading reviews, I realized this was a place I actually wanted to go.   I went for lunch today with my dad. I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club. He also ordered some random pork and shrimp dumplings that the guy at the counter handed to us cold and wrapped like it was bought at a gas station. He expected them to be hot and was a little put off by them. My dad would later call these \"icky.\" So those are probably something we will steer clear of in the future.  The sandwiches came out super fast. I don't know what I was expecting because when it was sort of cold I seemed surprised. When I read about this sandwich on-line it said it had crispy tofu strips, so I guess I just assumed it would be hot. It was a fresh baguette with tofu, pickled carrot and daikon, jalapeno, and cilantro. I loved it! It could have used about double the amount of tofu but it had good flavors. It was just the right size for me. Not to big, not to small. I enjoyed my sandwich very much. My dad's club sandwich was huge. I had debated on ordering the avocado sandwich but was glad I didn't because his sandwich was gigantic. He liked his choice as well. The value for the food at this place is also great. We ordered two sandwiches, two drinks, and the two spring rolls, and it was less than fifteen bucks. That's awesome!  I will definitely be back here, probably quite often seeing as how its just a quick bike ride from my house. And even though they only take cash, that doesn't bother me one bit seeing as how they manage to keep their prices really low. I'm a fan!",

The menu is expansive and you can find something for everyone. I got a grilled pork banh mi and an order of spring rolls. The banh mi was amazing! Pork was so juicy and tender and had great flavor. The bread was just right: chewy but with that great baguette crunch. I loved the amount of veggies they put on: perfect balance of the flavors and great crunch from them. Good heat from the jalepenos, though I wound up adding hot sauce, too.   Spring rolls weren't as good as I've had but did not skimp on the shrimp and were tasty enough. Prices are amazing and the food is ready super fast! They also have ice cream which they were nice enough to let me sample. The Taro flavor is awesome! I can't wait to come back and get a cone.   Note: they only take cash but they do have an ATM inside. Great place and I will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Hands down, besides having awesome Bahn Mi sandwiches, they also make a mean tasting baguette. As a matter of fact,  a few days ago when I was there to pick up our favorite bbq'd pork Bahn Mi, I felt obligated to buy a baguette that was piping hot out of the oven. So, because I live 30 minutes away, I started to pick at the baguette top while driving. It was hot and the bread was just perfect on it's own. Well, 15 minutes into driving, I realized I ate half the baguette. Feeling guilty, I put it away so I couldn't reach it while driving. Lesson learned,  hot Lee's baguettes and driving do not go hand in hand.  In any case, Lee's sandwiches is consistent and makes a great, cheap meal. The people watching isn't half bad either if you eat within. Their boba drinks are sometimes not thick enough and the eggrolls sometimes seem overcooked (maybe because they sit under the heat lamp)..but all in all, Lee's is one of my favorite go-to spots when I'm feeling the Bahn Mi craving..",

The sandwiches aren't the best, but definitely above average and are a great value for the price. The ice cream is also very good as well as the egg rolls.

Even though this place is 30 miles away from where I live, I have to stop by when I'm in Chandler. I get a toasty baguette that is perfect for lunch and dinner all for the price of $3.49. That's as cheap as it gets. Around Glendale, the banh mi ranges from $4 up to $7. It is no surprise that I buy multiple banh mi when I'm at Lee's to stock up, and share some with friends.    My favorite is the banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork sandwich). It's hard for me to eat all of it in one sitting, so I usually split the sandwich in half and eat the rest later. My boyfriend likes the banh mi cha lua pate (pork roll pate). I absolutely love the Vietnamese iced coffee. Be forewarned that it is strong! So strong that my heart races sometimes, but I simply can't resist it's unique taste that can't be found at your regular coffee shops.   Love this place. Fast service and great food. Nice place to stop by for lunch if you are at work. They provide you with free wifi - password on the receipt. Make sure you also bring some cash since they do not accept credit card - cash only.",

What as once a decently average banh mi is slowly getting worse.  Prices have been inching up over the past few years, and what used to be thick slices of bbq pork or chunks of grilled pork have given way to really think slivers of bbq pork and fattier grilled pork.    Not to say the sandwiches still aren't tasty, and they're an OK value, they're just not as good as they used to be.  I always appreciate the chicken wings (nice and crispy and a little spicy) and the fresh Deli Manjoo when they have it.  These couple things bring the rating up to an average 3 where I hope it stays for a while.",

Among sandwiches there are gourmet drinks such as boba drinks, coffee drinks, fresh sugar cane juice and bottled drinks. Viet egg rolls and veggie egg rolls, breakfast foods and grocery odds and ends are also available.   Bring cash as this is the form of payment to keep these food items at low costs. An ATM machine is available but looked like today it was not working for a couple ahead of me.   The grilled chicken sandwich with onion slices, pickled carrots slices and sliced daikon, cilantro and jalapeno slices all arranged in a baguette completed the meal. If you're not a fan of spicy then I suggest to immediately remove those jalapeno slices filled with seeds as this will burn your mouth and make you squeel for a minute or 2.   The turkey sandwich with tomatoes, red onion slices, cheese of your choice can be put on a baguette or croissant. Make sure you check that the right bread was given. Luckily they corrected the issue.   If you're looking for pate, look no further. They sell a few different brands here!",

    "text": "I went here a couple of times but lucky, I was able to go with a couple of friends who didn't even know what a Bahn Mi is. I told my friend who would have the most trouble adjusting to Vietnamese food to order a grilled pork sandwich, their most popular item. However, I am a fan of authenticity and I ordered their \"combination\" sandwich. This sandwich consists of Vietnamese deli meats such as (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saveur.com%2Farticle%2FKitchen%2FBanh-Mi-Sandwich-Ingredients&s=8190f3bffcf8f7abf4ef261edb0f642b5e4676c226ec22518458d6652f638f7c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">saveur.com/article/Kitch...</a>) Cha Lua, a cooked pork roll lightly seasoned with fish sauce, and traditionally steamed or boiled in a banana leaf. Thit Nguoi is a Vietnamese salami containing cured pork layered with fat and headcheese.  Whenever I order these ingredients... I always regret not getting the grilled pork. It's not like these plastic-like deli meats are flavorful, but grilled meat is just so much more satisfying. You have a delicious warmth when you bite into it, and the succulent juices of grilled meat just doesn't match the deli meat bite.  Either way, my friend enjoyed her sandwich.  The unique thing about Bahn Mi is the flavorful combinations through each bite. It satisfies literally every type of taste and texture you can think about. The baguette is extremely crunchy and complements the creaminess of the mayonnaise, the sweet and sour pickled vegetables bring a pucker of flavor and the cilantro gives freshness. Of course, the meat is the savory (umami for nerds) and juicy component.  For dessert, we decided to eat macarons. These colorful little cookies can pretty much impress everyone. My friend who tried them said that she had better at the Scottsdale Fashion Center, but I think those are a gold standard. Either way, when you bite into the macarons, you get a crispy outside and a semi-gooey inside which is what I like to find in my macarons.  The green tea macarons don't taste like green tea. They have a hint of lemon.  Ambiance Lee's Sandwiches remind me of a standard San Jose Vietnamese market shop except pristine and very clean. My friends and I were treated with a beautiful decorated Lunar New Year tree walking in. Like most Vietnamese places of this type, Vietnamese products are displayed on wired racks all the way throughout the register.   Service There is technically no service in the restaurant. You go up and order it pretty much like fast food.   Cost $4.00 or so for a 10 inch sandwich at most. Well worth the price and you can argue can give Subway a run for their money.  Selection For the sandwiches, you have two menus, the Vietnamese sandwiches and the American sandwiches with about 10 options each. Of course, you're here for some legitimate banh mi so your options are: weird Vietnamese meats, grilled meats, or vegetarian.   Overall If you want a quick bite to eat and you want to experience a Vietnamese subway, just go to lee's Sandwiches and you will not be disappointed.",

They have so many sandwiches to choose from and my stomach is only big enough for one. I ended up ordering number #11 that everyone else on yelp seems to recommend and a Taro Boba milk tea. The sandwich is so good i ended up having the other half for lunch (and it was still good). The taro drink is also flavorable.   On my way out, I also purchased some cookies and Macaroons to go. It has the matching color for the flavor...but unfortunately, it doesnt taste like it. I ordered coconut, mocha, green tea flavor Macaroons but they all taste the same - sweet but not much else. I was disappointed since I love Macaroons.   Nevertheless, the cashier at the corner was super friendly. The dining area is spacious and clean. Ill definitely come back here to try out other sandwiches for sure.",

When Lee's Sandwiches opened up in Arizona, I was pee-in-my-pants ecstatic!    There's really no bad sandwich here.  I love their pickled daikon and carrots, the pate spread, the headcheese, fresh cilantro, spicy jalapenos, and the cold cuts selection here.  No matter the arrangement, it's always delicious.  There's really no such thing as a bad banh mi at Lee's!  Lee's Sandwiches also sells ice cream, Deli Manjoo Cakes at their own little kiosk, and hot pastries.  The pork pate chaud is one of my favorite things to get.  It's a tiny meatball inside layers of flaky crust.  Yum!  If you need  some pure caffeine on long torturous days, I recommend the Vietnamese iced coffee.  That stuff is strong.  For a sweeter beverage, I reach for their sugarcane juice.    Remember to bring cash or risk using their sketchy ATM machine.  It's seriously suspect.  *** Featured in The Weekly Yelp, January 28, 2015 - Sandwiches: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread",

There are a variety of sandwiches, both Vietnamese style and European style. The food is extremely cheap. Banh mi is about 2-3 dollars on average. They also have spring rolls, egg rolls (so good), and other food to snack on. Did I mention boba? Yes, they have all types of boba drinks! But, I normally get the sugar cane juice drink. It reminds me of Vietnam where street vendors sell sugar can juice, which is hard to find here. Give it a try! You may like it!   Important note: they only accept cash. They do have a atm within the location.",

    "text": "Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.  Cons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees).   Also, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit.",

That all changed after I saw a photo taken by Joyce W. of a delicious Banh Mi sandwich that came across my Yelp feed.  The flavors were through the roof!  Just the right amount of pickled daikon, spicy jalapenos, and fresh cilantro.  The baguette was still fresh even though I came in the evening.     I went with #11 and #5, and both were really delicious.  Simple but very tasty, the best Banh Mi I've had in AZ easily.    The Free iced coffee on check in was also delicious!  Now that I know I will definitely be back!  The affordable price is just a bonus, all that sandwich for under $4 each, #AllDayLong    Cash only",

I have been to Lee's a few times and no matter what time of day the croissants are always flakey, soft, and delicious and the baguettes are warm and crusty. They even have a ham/cheese croissant that hits the spot perfectly in the morning. I like to accompany mine with a Lee's coffee, which to be honest I dont really know what it is. Some kind of iced-sweet-latte-goodness. If you're in the mood for a larger breakfast they offer four different types of egg/meat/croissant sandwiches too.   If you happen to stop in during lunch there are over 20 different sandwiches to choose from. Some are basic turkey and ham. The others have more of a...uh...Vietnamese flare to them. All are about $6 and come on your choice of a baguette or croissant (my four star rating is mostly due to the fact that the meat is a little stingy). After lunch you can crave that sweet tooth with some ice cream or a smoothy.   One thing you will notice about Lee's is its cleanliness! Always immaculate. I dont know how they manage it but it has to be the easiest stop on the health inspectors route. Pop in late in the day if you want some cheap day old bread, which is still pretty great.  *One more thing- Be sure to bring cash!! Double check your wallet because this is a no card establishment.",

    "text": "Mediocre - neither here nor there.    A Vietnamese grilled chicken sandwich and a European roast beef (both on baguette).  May give this place another try if I am bored with just about every type of sandwich shop in town, but otherwise, I doubt I'd re-visit.  The grilled chicken contained very sub-standard chicken \"pieces\" and wasn't very flavorful and the roast beef was almost too chewy and lacked flavor.  On the plus side, the baguette was authentic, fresh and delicious but that really isn't enough to carry the sandwich.",

If they evened out the ratio a bit more, it may be more palatable. The biggest knock on their sandwiches is that they aren't real banh mi. Think Panda Express in regards to real Chinese food. Lee's is an Americanized establishment that caters to a clientele, in AZ, that doesn't have much in terms of authentic Vietnmese food options.   The egg rolls they sell here have usually been sitting out for a couple of hours, I'm pretty sure that they are not in compliance with the food safety code in that regard. If you go in the morning though, you should be safe. I've purchased egg rolls at 3:00pm from here and had that rock hard on the outside and super dry on the inside experience. Whenever that happens, you know that they've been sitting out for a while.  If you're in AZ, you're stuck going to this place because there's nothing around here that's a better option for \"banh mi style\" sandwiches. Those not from around here will recognize immediately that what they are selling is not banh mi.   Go in with adjusted expectations and you will enjoy it more.",

I think it's so cool to watch the bread being baked (BTW, loaves come out fresh every 30 minutes) The cashiers are wonderful, and make an effort to know us by name. The prices are very affordable. They only take cash. The service is always fast even when the place is completely packed. Also, Lee's is centrally located. I love this place, and I would recommend trying it!",

    "text": "Do I like their Asian sandwiches?  Yes.  Their coffee, yes.  Their pastries, sure.   But this review is based off of a recent experience with their (new?) breakfast sandwich.  Not sure how long they've had breakfast sandwiches on their menu but this was the first time seeing the option since I was last there.  So I came in for breakfast and I ordered a pate chaud and an almond croissant, so that didn't require any waiting.  My boyfriend on the other hand, decided to try their bacon/egg/cheese breakfast croissant.  After ten minutes of waiting, I was getting rather hungry so I started to eat my pastries.  5 - 7 minutes later after I ate my stuff, the breakfast sandwich still did not come out.  This was a 15-17 minute wait already, and the shop was not even busy.  Imagine sitting there hearing number after number being called (EXCEPT YOURS), and looking at people who came in 15 mins after you did, eating their food.  And you are just sitting there wondering where your shit is.  So we get up, walk up to the window and ask where our sandwich is.  The guy at the window states it should be coming out \"soon\" and the wait is due to the fact that the eggs are being made in the back of the kitchen.  Look, if you can't fry a damn egg in under 5 minutes, there is seriously something wrong with you.  If I were the manager, I'd either implement a training on how to efficiently cook an egg or just hire someone else who is more efficient, OR teach your employee to come up with better excuses.   After being told the sandwich is coming out \"soon\", we waited another 10-12 minutes.  I want to stress that I am not being dramatic about this, as there was another couple who ordered the same thing we did and were waiting a long time as well.  Frustrated, we asked for our money back and were subsequently told AGAIN that \"your sandwich is coming out soon.\" I decided that if \"SOON\" was not 3 mins or less, I'd go ghetto on their ass.  Luckily for them, the sandwich came up a couple minutes after that.  I made it a point to check in front of the employee's face to see if the sandwich was piping hot, which it was, but that only proves the sandwich was recently made.    Lesson of the day for anyone working in the restaurant industry?  If you forgot someones food, just admit it and apologize.  Don't lie to me.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to put egg, bacon and cheese in between a croissant and heat it up.  The sandwich, I kid you not, was 4x4 in size, with 2 pieces of bacon, some cheese and an omelette style egg. Definitely NOT worth a 30 minute wait, especially in a fast food joint.  We should've just went to McDonalds across the street.    If I have to stand there and stare you down and make sure that you are making my food, I probably won't come back.",

He went back to get a refund and they asked what was the problem with the macaron and he told the person at the counter that it's raw.

Grab a fresh baguette to go or a day-old one to make bread pudding or French toast later. The fresh bread is amazing -- you could just by a baguette and some butter and go to town.  All of the pastries I've had there have likewise been excellent. The little cream-filled cakes (deli manjoo?) are pretty tasty, although I've OD'd on those before and have to take it easy. Don't order the box of 20 and try to eat it all at once!  I love the veggies (including sliced fresh jalapenos) on the \"Asian sandwiches\" and I don't know if I've ever had any other type here. Beware the #8 Shredded Pork, a.k.a 'pork skin' sandwich... if you've never had one before, it probably isn't what you expect. The cashiers generally realize your level of \"non-Asian-ness\" and ask if you're REALLY sure when you try to order it. Don't be offended, they're just making sure you get something that you want to eat. :)   It may be a cash-only establishment, but the prices are very reasonable, the menu is extensive, and service is normally fast.",

Lee's has a pretty large menu, which is typical and sells everything from sandwiches, drinks, pastries, snacks to desserts.  Came in to order a #10 Cured Pork & Pork Sandwich, typically most Banh Mi's come with slices of Jalapeno, Cilantro, Pickled Carrot and Daikon, slathered with mayo and Pate and stuffed with cured meats, such as Cha Lua (cured pork sausage) or other types of deli ham encased in a French baguette. My sandwich was sorely lacking, with only two springs of cilantro, one slice of Jalapeno and literally 4 thinly sliced pieces of ham. Absolutely disappointed, all this in a 10 inch baguette.  I also ordered a Jackfruit Smoothie with boba and found the smoothie absolutely watered down and super sweet. The boba was also not well cooked and not flavored.  Definitely disappointed in my experience here. Spent $ on food served with the bare minimum of quality and service.  This place is also CASH ONLY.

But if you enjoy Asian or French food, proceed. Freshly baked croissants, baguettes, There are so many sandwiches choices. My favorite is the #1 special and #12 Vegetarian and a Lee's iced coffee. But everything is good. Breakfast croissant sandwich is amazing. There are fun treats too like egg custard, real colored macaroons, red bean balls, pork buns, etc. Prepare to sit to people watch too.",

I love the additional sweets and treats they offer now, including various packaged dried squid jerky (Yep, I used to snack on these all the time as a kid!), jelly rolls, mochi, and macarons ($1.25 each). The bubble tea is decent here, and the taro with boba I had today was light and refreshing. One of these days I'll try their manjoo- it looks pretty tasty! Upgrade one star!  P.S. Cash only but they do have an ATM in the store.",

The baguette really makes this sandwich bangin. The baguette's are bakes fresh every 30 mins. Nice and soft on the inside, the perfect crunch on the outside! I can't come here without leaving with just a fresh baguette alone.   Their boba smoothies are on point too. Perfect sweetness. Flavors are on point. Tapioca balls are nice and soft.  When I want to save the sandwiches for later, I usually ask them for the veggies on the side!  The only thing I don't like about this location is that they accept cash only. Also when making the Vietnamese coffee, they add so much ice. Literally 90% ice, 10% coffee.",

It's a lunch time, I am with friends and in a rush, so I am more collaborative and I ask if larger frappe will cost more than five dollars. He says, \"It's $4.75. Then I am going to charge you 25 cents\". So this is just a subjective bullshit he's pulling out. I call it an unacceptably bad customer service.  On the frappe quality: it was highly unremarkable. Lots of ice.  They call in the mic your number if it's ready and repeat it multiple times. Very annoying.  I really wanted to stop by some other time to try their sandwiches, but I lost the desire after such treatment.",

I have to say that it is not the best Vietnamese sandwich I've ever eaten because the bread is  hard and the taste kind of bland. I feel like it's not the original Vietnamese banh mi where they use Vietnamese baguette, which is a little smaller and softer and more tastier.

I also got a mini chicken pate chaud which was super disappointing. It was 98% puff pastry and 2% meat. The meat was tasty but literally the diameter of a nickel! One tiny tiny bite of chicken.  The iced coffee was free with check in so I feel bad criticizing it. Was good but super sugary. Had to dilute it 4 fold in order to drink it. Definitely worth a try but expect a sugar bomb.  Overall, the taste didn't meet my expectations based on initial impression and rave yelp reviews. But, I haven't given up on Lee's yet and will give it one more shot!  Note: cash only!",

With a split menu featuring a European side and an Asian side, you'll certainly find something you've never tried or heard of. I recommend branching out, try something new, the barbecue pork sandwich is unbelievable. You will not regret your visit to Lee's.",

The fresh crusty bread, the varieties of meats and crisp veggies, the pate--all blend together for an amazingly flavorful combo.  This was lackluster at best.  The bread was only semi fresh, and they didn't put pate on it.  No pate?! Seriously? Guess what they substituted for the crowning glory of every bahn mi I've ever eaten? MAYONNAISE.  That's right.  They splooged mayo all over the thing, like it was squishing out the other end as I ate.  Ew! I HATE mayonnaise.  Freaking hell.  The meats and veggies were pretty good, but quite skimpy.  The price would have been very reasonable for a decent sandwich, but not for what they served me.  And I really hate to say that, because the folks behind the counter were very nice.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The place was clean.  But the food, the thing I came here for, was lacking.  So its two stars.  In future, I think I'll be going elsewhere.",

When I went back today, I found it to be cheap in a different way, as well.  I ordered the #17 (Jambon and Pork) on a croissant and a large thai iced tea with no ice. 2 items, $9. Not quite the Lee's I remembered. They called my number and I walked up to get my food. Croissant sandwich, check. No ice in my drink, check. Thai iced tea...half check. My large cup was only half full (not being optimistic). Quite literally half full. I picked up my cup and asked where the rest of my drink was and was told that I ordered no ice (well duh). I told him I didn't order \"no drink\" and he said he wouldn't give me what I paid for.  Very very disappointed. The only thing that saved Lee's from 1 star was the delicious sandwich.  Food - 4 stars Customer service - no stars",

It is actually very close to where I live, but because my daily commute doesn't directly pass it I often forget about it. This place has the best baguettes in town and everything I have had here is amazing.   I forgot that they default to American cheese on the European sandwiches, so specify that you want another kind. Side note: Why is American cheese the crappiest of all cheeses?...discuss.   They also do homemade ice cream which is very good.   Sandwich, chips and a drink for lunch was about $8.50, but the sandwich is 2 servings for most normal human beings. I always wrap up half for another time.   If you are a bit more adventurous, try the Vietnamese sandwiches which really is what makes this place shine. Great bread, great meat, great veggies. Everything I have tried has been fantastic.",

I was a little bit disappointed that the Vietnamese coffee (bottled version) was frozen, but figured out it might have been shipped frozen from CA. Big giant oven can tell you that the breads baked fresh here. I would recommend Dac Biet or Thit Nguoi baguette, and remember to tell them if you don't want spicy or want vegetables separate if you travel out of town (especially in hot weather).",

Sometimes if you go too early, they run out of bread and you wait an eternity for the next batch. You'd think based off of supply and demand, they can gauge baking more bread so they don't run out. Their spring rolls are kinda gross. There eggrolls are standard. The chicken wings are like crack. They have MSG in them and are spicy. Their pastries are fresh looking but I have not tried them myself. I hate that they are cash only. Most obvious reason is to cheat taxes. In this day and age, cash is obsolete. You lose more customers that don't have cash than you save in fees.",

Even though you have to pay in cash (they have a on site ATM), it's worth it.  I would seriously give this place a shot if you have not already.",

This time we chose Lee's for a) its affordability and b) the said tastiness of the sandwiches.  Well, the sandwich was not a disappointment.  Very straightforward menu, if you go for the traditional as opposed to some of the more interesting choices they have.  Went with a ham and turkey on croissant.  Croissant was flaky and buttery.  Would have liked more choices in spreads, besides mayo and yellow mustard.  Not a fan of either.  I tried sweet and sour sauce on it, not bad.  If you are in the area and need a meal.  Lee's is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Spectacular, no, but filling, yes.  And remember bring cash or pay the ATM fees at the joint.",

I'm not exactly sure of the sandwich's price....but it is under $3.  The extra meat is about 75 cents more.  You can't beat the price.  The baguette is chewy, the veggies are great, be careful of the jalepenos if you don't like spice but you can ask for none if you prefer.  If you are really going for some meat, don't be afraid to order triple meat since the double portion isn't exactly overlowing.  I always just drink water here but our first time in we also order the Thai iced tea.  My friend did not like it at all and brought his tea right back up to the counter.  The person in charge was very irritated because my friend brought this drink back but he eventually gave us the money back.  I just drank mine, a milky/creamy concoction that was exotice and not-too-bad.    Oh!  You must get a cream horn for dessert!  I think it is about a dollar and worth every cent of that dollar.  Mmmm, we love them!  All in all, not to many weeks goes by before one of us suggests going into Lee's for a sandwich!",

Don't like the new close earlier hours either. Wish they would open way after 8. When they used to close at 9, I thought they were closing too early already.

On my subsequent visit, I figured I would try something a little more mainstream so it was the Turkey Club with bacon on a baguette, which was just okay with the sugar cane juice.  Word of advice, if you decide to order the sugar cane juice also get a half cup of water so you can dilute it a bit.  Of course, I always enjoy their ice cream.

For the adventurous people they have exotic flavors like Durian. They also serve ice cream, hot wings and egg rolls (not sure if any of that stuff goes together but they make it work). The store itself is always immaculately clean (even the bathrooms, which is important to the weaker bladder individuals like myself). The only downside here is they make you PAY IN CASH!

When my hubby and I first moved to Chandler, we would drive by Lee's all the time and always comment on how we'd love to try it because it's so damn bright and enticing. That was five years ago and we're hooked. We take everyone from out of town here to eat at least once. My Korean in laws ask to come here first thing when they visit from Guam.  It's tasty and it's easy on the pocket book. Plus the soothing Asian voice announcing your order numbers is awesome.  My favorite is the #4 Grilled Chicken Vietnamese sandwich. I love the jalapenos, cilantro and daikon radish...gives it such a unique flavor. And the baguettes are awesome. They freshly make the bread right there in the store. It's perfection.  The croissant sandwiches are amazing as well. Big, buttery and delicious.  I also recommend their smoothies with the boba beads in them.

    "text": "In an attempt to justify eating 1.5 sandwiches before noon, the boyfriend and I ambitiously decided to bike to Lee's from Tempe. (OK, I am embellishing. We don't live super far, so it wasn't an incredibly long bike ride.)  As far as chains go, I really love Lee's Sandwiches. This venue was bigger than most and had a huge array of snacks and smoothies. Extremely clean and well-maintained, and fast service.  The only con was that I couldn't find any bike racks and I do wish there was more of that mayo-butter concoction on the sandwiches. It would be cool if they were open past 8pm too. Also, I couldn't find any bathrooms?  Definitely better tasting than Mekong Sandwiches, though! I think it's because of their bread. Lee's Sandwiches are overall a bit smaller than Mekong but the taste of their baguettes is remarkably better.  One last note: I freaking love how Lee's provides their nutritional information online. Yeah, it's probably not exact, but still nice! (Not that I like it when MyFitnessPal tells me I've eating 110% of my calories by 12pm, but that's what being 4'10 and hungry does to you.)  Biking to Chandler to stock up on some delicious Vietnamese french bread sandwiches is definitely going to be a new weekly tradition.",

Took about a good 5 min to get called for my order.   Bahn mi bread was a bit chewy and hard. Seemed it was baked more than 24 hours ago?  Thought it would be fresher given their own bakery?  Anyway, the meat and veggie sides were ok, but for $4.95, thought it would be fuller with more meat content. Coming from Texas, this would be priced around $3.50. For the money, it tasted like a day old bread. Wasn't bad, but definitely could be better.   Got the large tarp and large mango, both with boba. The mango want bad for flavor and overall smoothness. The drink was consistently blended to the very end. Taro on the hand was barely full, I'm taking like 80% full, and this was a large. Taking it back to hotel to really enjoy it, towards the bottom, it was little ice chunks.  Then there the boba, which had no flavor and it was definitely not freshly made as some of the boba was icy hard to chew on.   Overall, I was a bit disappointed as the store was large, decorated with lots of colorful posters of food and drinks.",

They have a lot of offerings such as their bahn mi sandwiches (must try the Vietnamese styled ones), gelato, a hot appetizer selection with pork buns, smoothies, drinks, a small marketplace of sorts, and others. I absolutely love their baguettes when it is fresh. I would recommend trying the sandwiches first and then when you are drawn back, to try everything else.   The only reason I knocked down a star is the consistency aspect. I have gotten some of the best smoothies and some of the worst (huge ice chunks). The same consistency problem applies to their sandwiches. Usually the baguettes are great, but there are times (especially at the end of the day) where it is stale. The sandwiches normally dont have this problem, but the ones that are displayed by the cash register, such as the garlic bread, seem to have been sitting for a while.",

Also, at lunch time be prepared to WAIT, not only are there lots of people but some of their cashiers are slow as molasses. Pick up the pace and go bake bread if you don't know how to count!! 1 Star down for slow cashiers and another star down for cash only with an always broken ATM machine.

The meat to condiments ratio is just right for my taste buds. They only accept cash so \"prices can stay low\" (I think that is bogus, though, because they recently increased the price); but they are so yummy, it will be worth the money. Anyway, try their baguettes. My favorite is the Special Combination sandwich which I think is number 11. Pair it with a Viet Iced Coffee to wash down the food. That, my friend, is a great combo.",

    "text": "Lee's Sandwiches is a great Vietnamese sandwich shop. I love the mint milk, it is so refreshing. It is perfect after a meal or anytime and they give you a big size. Of course you can get it boba or they have a wide selection of other teas and drinks:  Taro, Honeydew, Soy Bean, carrot, strawberry and passion fruit drinks! Italian sodas, mint jelly, watermelon, sugar cane, iced lattes.   Any and all smoothies:  banana, apple, avocado (yes, avocado), cranberry, durian (mmm yes, you read that right), carrot, durian-green bean, green bean, jack fruit, lychee ect. too many to list.   They make their own bread on site and the ingredients are always fresh and quality. I am a vegetarian and there are a few options as far as sandwiches go:    Vegetarian-Fried tofu, vermicelli, bean curd, yam, carrot, house pickle, jalapeno, cilantro, salt & pepper and soy sauce. Very good if you like fried tofu like me!  California avocado-Avocado, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, mustard.  Don't forget, you can always ask them to add to any sandwich to make it custom! They have pork and shrimp egg rolls, coconut waffles, croissants and pastries.",

As you wait in line to order there are shelves of Asian foods on each side of you.  So many interesting things to look at keeps you entertained while waiting  Since they seem to always be baking it smells heavenly from the wonderful breads to the soft flaky delicious crossaints and beyond!  It is a must to try one different pastry each time to experience the culture!  I cannot go on enough about their pastries!! AMAZING!!  The sandwiches are a culinary experience that's takes you on a mouth watering tour.  I like the combo on baguette ... Thereis not a ton of meats but enough to satisfy and you can always order double meat for cheap  The sandwiches are less than $5.00 and are on a soft crusty delicious fresh baguette or you can opt to have it in a crossaint so ordering double meat for those who are super hungry still makes it a very reasonably priced meal!  Also tons of drinks to choose from be it Thai tea to coffees to cold drinks and  they have fresh sugar cane drink which as you can imagine is sweeter than I can handle... But was fun to try.  There is ample seating and the place is always clean!  They decorate for holidays and when you walk in the door you feel the welcome!  I am a harsh critic but I gotta say.... LEES IS A MUST TRY RESTAURANT...  And as we all know from my reviews.....It must be something special for me to rave....  Something for everyone!  So in closing..... Remember to take time to stop and smell the roses... Life is too short!  Bon appetite'",

I also ordered the house iced coffee.   The order came up quick.  We were excited..... Then we opened the grilled pork sandwich to take the onions off and to our surprise there was only a few pieces of fatty meat on the whole 10 inch sandwich.  My mom took the sandwich up to the front and the first gentleman told my mom they weigh the meat and that's all you get.  Then my mom spoke with the manager and she said the same thing.... We weigh the meat and it has 2.4 oz, then she proceeded to take the sandwich and weigh it!  She offered a refund but never offered to add more meat.  Then she came to our table and explained again that the sandwich is \"only\" 3 dollars and we weigh the meat blah blah!  Then she said she would get in trouble if she added more meat and they have to keep their costs down.  Seriously???  Maybe if you would make the sandwich with a normal amount of meat you would have more business and make more money???!  Business 101!!!  I wish I would have taken a photo....   Btw my iced coffee was good but they filled it 2-3 inches from the top:(.  One star for fast service and clean environment.... 0 stars for customer service and CHEAPSKATE mentality!!!!",

The husband and I got the BBQ pork and the shredded pork sandwiches.  The shredded pork was great and came with fish sauce on it (yum) and the girl at the counter had the presence of mind to warn us about the fish sauce - that it's an \"acquired taste\".  Well, luckily we both love fish sauce so this was a hit.  The BBQ pork wasn't so great - lots of chewy fat which is OK on hot meat but I have a hard time with when it's cold.  The fresh pressed lemonade was indeed fresh pressed, and lightly, perfectly sweetened.   The bread is tear-your-mouth-up crunchy, which I like - but if you're not a crunchy crust kinda person, beware.",

I was VERY hesitant to try an \"Asian Style\" sandwich, but the #12 Vegetarian sandwich has me HOOKED.  I'm a sucker for fresh ingredients such as the cilantro, jalapenos, yam, carrot, vermicelli, and daikon.  The bean curd sounds strange, but seriously, just go for it! It's certainly a winner at 3.5 grams of fat.  The #4 Grilled Chicken is delightful as well, but be warned that the chicken is not a \"tradition American sandwich\" type.  This also goes with the pork and jambon sandwich fillings.  Again, I say,  just go with it-- they work in the entire sandwich package :)  The Grilled Chicken is also a winner at only 4 grams of fat.  The spring rolls are prepared daily and are offered as appetizers.  I tried eating lightly and sticking to only them as a lunch, but they just aren't filling enough.  They are, however, perfect as an appetizer, which is of course what they are intended as.  One warning:  My unadventurous Midwestern meat-n-potatoes parents were unimpressed and confused by \"Asian style\" sandwiches.  Luckily for them, Lee's also offers an array of European style croissants and baguettes for stiffs.  Of course, all of the breads are baked in house!",

A con about this place is that sometimes the cashier man looks like he's annoyed or depressed. Cashiers should be positive! Or they get no tip! And it's cash only which is also a pain in the butt. It's 2011 and we all use a card nowadays doh",

So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.",

So being that I've relocated here, this was the only place so far that has authentic Vietnamese style sandwiches. I've had the vegetarian one quite a few times, and although I am super happy with it in general, it does not have slabs of BBQ tofu as I'm used to... I wish it did!! With out a juicy tofu inside, this vege sandwich tends to be dry and lacking the kick and the fillings that I'm used to getting in Hawaii and LA. I get the feeling like Arizona is not a tofu happy place. I very rarely see it on menus as I do in Hawaii and LA. :( I think this sandwich would be killer if they used real pieces of BBQ'd tofu. I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find.",

You obviously know they have fresh baguettes as they are practically made right in front of you (nice touch).    I do have to say that their sandwiches are OK and not really anything that amazed me or impressed me.. just OK.  In short, it works for team lunches because there are lots of menu options (they have huge croissants, also... yummy buttery goodness).  I have yet to try their Boba, but their variety of flavors did catch my eye.  I did, bravely enough, try their Durian ice-cream.. for those who have never heard of it , it is a nasty smelling fruit popular in Asian countries, though it is banned from public appearance due to it's horrendous, foul odor ... and taste!  Well, you can imagine their Durian ice cream was no different.  We did it more for a dare between coworkers, but I tried it and was disgusted... effin gross, man... that's all I can say (that did not weigh on my 3 star review, in case you were curious).",

    "text": "I was in the mood to have a Banh Mi and it's been quite awhile since I ate here, probably 2-3 years.  It was a rainy day and it just seemed like the right type of food and to down it with a boba drink.  Thought about treating my mechanic and his helper and I thought my husband would like this.  And I know my kids already like this, and they were starting to eat solid food again from being sick the past week.  Ordered 3 grilled pork Banh Mi's, 2 grilled chicken and a roast beef croissant sandwich and 2 orders of 5 pork & shrimp egg rolls.  There was nobody ordering at the time we ordered and the lull of any lunch rush was over.  The Banh Mi's were very reasonably priced at $3.49 and it's quite a lot for a sandwich.  The egg rolls, I thought, were a little pricey at $3.99 for 5 Vietnamese style egg rolls (deep fried), but the sandwich price made up for this.  I can't remember how much the small croissant sandwich was, but I think that was close to $5 and it wasn't very big.  So the deal is to get a Banh Mi, but my son wasn't up to eating that much and needed something softer.  All that came to about $31-32, which that's food for 6 people's lunches, so not bad.  It took probably 15 minutes to make the order, which the egg rolls were already prepared, so I thought it took a bit more time.  I didn't know that the Banh Mi wrappers indicated what sandwich it was.  The guy that took my order is Latino, which isn't a big deal.  I think the guy making the stuff was Asian.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash.  They do not take credit or debit cards and there is a machine for you to get cash, but there is a $1.75 charge.  I wish they had this as a sign on the front door - CASH ONLY!    Next time I will know.  That was why I gave it a 4 star, but really, it only deserves a 1/2 star knock down for that, not a full star.  But, since I'm Asian, I should know that some Asian places only do cash.  Okay, heck, I'll give them 5 stars.  We'd go again.  Everyone that I got the sandwiches for liked them.  The baguette was perfect - somewhat toasted on the outside and slightly soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was very tasty and just enough of the veggies, not too much.  Just the right amounts of meat and veggies.  My mechanic and his helper had the grilled chicken Banh Mi and they loved it.  The egg rolls were good.",

    "text": "Lee's Sandwiches is a chain that specializes in sub-style sandwiches with an Asian or Pacific taste.  They offer a good alternative to subs as opposed to the more traditional American types, and I think the biggest draw for us is the bread, which is sub-style and fabulous.  Some of the sandwiches they offer up are more European flavored, and we've tried a few of those, but they're a bit more \"traditional\" and didn't quite tickle our tastes the way the Asian ones have.  Prices are pretty reasonable -- especially given it's mostly a sandwich shop -- but be warned: they do not take credit card ... only cash.  Very spacious place to eat, and usually we haven't had to wait all that long for our subs.",

    "text": "I am giving it three starts intead of four stars because they COMPLETELY messed up my order.  So I went to Lee's for the first time ever. So this is my first experience/impression of it and since they messed up my order, I don't have a positive impression.   I came in and wanted to order a BBQ pork Banh Mi. I felt like the cashier seemed a little rude but I don't think he was rude; I think it was the nature of his tone. It might be a cultural thing. I asked him which one he would recommend or what was good but he didn't really suggest anything. Oh wells.  So I wanted BBQ pork because I like it and I had it at other places. Once I paid, I wait for like 30 seconds, I hear the intercom call out numbers. I look down at my ticket and I realized my number is called. I am a little confused how they worked so quickly on my order but I just proceed and pick up my order. I didn't question it. I just took it home. Once I am home, I look at the sandwiches. There's apparently three in there, I thought they happen to split one sandwich into threes because I asked for them to cut it in half and I thought \"WOW is the bread that long?\" So I look at the ticket inside the bag, it reads grilled chicken x 3. However, I noticed in the bag, two of them are grilled chicken, one of them is something else. So this made me realize two things...  1. Not only they gave me the wrong order (although they confirmed my number when I stood up to the counter and I looked at my ticket a few times and I am like okay that's me!)... 2. But they also messed up the order that read chicken x 3 because it wasn't all chicken....  I am not even sure if the one I ate was chicken because it reminds me of pate... Anyways, it's decent. I like it. Good price. Soft/chewy bread. Sandwiches are something I'll go back for but the service I had the first time confused me and just worries me.  Note: There's free Wi-Fi according to the sign on the door. I didn't check if the Wi-Fi worked or not, I would assume it works just fine?",

They are really stingy on the ingredients. For example, a 4-dollar Thai ice tea I ordered contained over 50% ice, and when I asked them to remove some ice and replace it with more tea, they refused and said something to the effect that refills were not allowed even though I had not yet consumed any.   On a side note, there is a sign at the register that reads, \"in order to keep prices low we only accept cash.\" In my opinion, their prices are fair, but by no means low.  In the future, I certainly won't go out of my way to patronize this establishment. I'll be doing them a favor since I don't want to break their profit margin by asking for less ice in the drinks!",

The veggie sandwich was lacking toppings overall....maybe we should have asked for avocado on it too (the picture of the veggie banh mi had avocado so I was deceived), but really, there were barely any other veggies, just crispy strings of something soaked in soy sauce and then some carrots and cilantro sparsely placed on the bread. Overall veryyyy unimpressive.  The pastry puff is delicious. I will continue coming back for plain baguettes that are freshly baked, iced coffee, and maybe will try the sugarcane juice next time!!",

Since moving to the west side of the valley, it has probably been 2-3 years since I've been here but my bf and I were in the area and had cash so we decided to go back to our younger days lol. Every Asian in Arizona has been here and we are no different. We love their 10 inches of yummy meat and veggies in a french baguette for less than $3.50 each. They got my order wrong the first time (gave me pork instead of chicken), but replaced it right away. The place is big with lots of tables and chairs to sit in. I noticed as we were choosing a seat that some tables were sprinkled with left over bread crumbs from the last patron enjoying their sandwich there so maybe a tad lack in cleanliness. However, Lee's Sandwiches will always have a place in my heart.",

I wish there was an option to pay extra for additional meat as one sandwich doesn't seem to fill me up.  The seating area is pretty nice and it is usually very clean.

They used to only take cash but now they take card as well. So I'm glad they made it convenient for everyone.  My favorite Vietnamese sandwiches to get is the BBQ Pork #6 and the Lee's combination #1. The sandwich normally comes with the meat, house carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro. The flavor is great and the bread has a nice soft but firm crust to it. The sandwich is probably like a foot long. I spent $15.86 on one BBQ pork and two combinations.  I'm glad that they built two locations in Arizona but I hope they build more because people should be more diverse to Asian food.",

    "text": "Lee's Sandwiches has been my favorite Vietnamese sandwich shop for a while now. Back in my hometown of Oklahoma City, we have one in what's known as Asian District, and it's a pretty popular place, everyone loves it for their banh mi sandwiches, baguettes, and coffee.  I was so happy to find a familiar shop when I moved to Arizona and had to get my usual grilled chicken banh mi sandwich and iced latte to-go. The quality of food and drink was the same as it is back home, excellent!  Service:   From the moment you order until the moment your order is ready takes 5 minutes or less no matter how busy the store is. The staff is friendly and when I asked for a cheese danish, even though they didn't have the one I wanted, they offered me something similar, which was sweet of them.  Food:  *Grilled Chicken Banh Mi* this is an \"Asian sandwich\" The baguette is nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, grilled chicken is smothered with that honest to goodness vietnamese mayonnaise, cilantro, carrots, and jalapenos.   *Pastries* my favorite pastries from Lee's are the cheese or fruit danishes. I have tried the cheese, cherry, and blueberry danishes, and all of them are so delicious, pastry so soft and flaky and fruit/cheese sweet so it serves as a dessert treat.  They also offer \"Euro Sandwiches\" which are croissants or baguettes with combinations of either ham, turkey, and/or cheese. I haven't tried the Euro sandwiches here, but I'm sure they are great.   If you're looking for a good banh mi, come to Lee's. Service is speedy quick, so I would call it almost a fast food banh mi restaurant.",

When I ordered them, the woman at the front said it would take about 5 minutes so I said that was fine. 10 minutes later, no egg rolls. I went up the counter and she went in the back to check on them. A minute later someone brought out a bag of egg rolls and I left because I needed to get back to work. I didn't even look at the rolls until I got back to my desk and when I opened the bag I was met with a bunch of burnt, fried to a crisp egg rolls. They totally forgot about them, left them in the oil and had the audacity to still serve them. I can't believe they would do that to a paying customer who was nothing but polite to them. I won't be back.",

Since then, a couple of things have remained the same... they are still a cash only establishment and their bread is still one of the best!   This is definitely not to go for an authentic banh mi.",

A couple things that I do recommend with confidence is the vietnamese coffee and fresh baked baguettes! Not only does the coffee taste good, it really does the job and keeps me up for hours! As for the baguettes - they're sold fresh, soft, and warm. When I have no self control, I could find myself snacking on the whole baguette before my mom is even done preparing our meal.   Tip: Lee's was a \"cash only\" establishment for as long as I could remember - but upon my visit today, I was informed that they do accept card now!",

It is located just across Warner Road from Lee Lee Market so if you are doing some Asian shopping it is a great place to stop by for a quick lunch or pick up a Bahn Mi sandwich to take home.  Cash only prices are very, very reasonable.  I always order the # 14 Asian Sandwich -Pork Roll and Pate on a 10 inch Baguette.  I also always order double meat (extra $ .75) because the meat portions are small and the prices are so reasonable it makes sense to me to go for the extra.  Lee's Baguette's are fresh and crunchy and the Pork Roll and Pate are really tasty.  Each sandwich is made to order so it takes a few minutes to get your order but well worth the wait.

Banh mi with the original French chewy baguette rolls and classic spreads. There can be more filling to be honest, but it's still very good and it's a sizeable meal. Most people can't handle the raw jalapeno slices, so don't forget to pick those out if you're one of them.   Iced drinks are good, especially the iced coffee but sometimes it's too much ice. Try the sugarcane juice if you never had it before. Very sweet and refreshing.   You get your sandwich and go. There's no fancy service. All the banh mi are under $4.  It's a big store and there's a lot of seating. The repeating automated voice calling out numbers might get annoying but I tune it out.   It's so Asian here. The decor and the foods and the service and the products... But all sorts come in, it's great.  Note: don't leave the banh mi in your car and forget about it. It will stink up your car like no other.

And if you aren't adventurous to try the Asian sandwiches, they have an American menu of ham and cheese, and whatever else I don't pick up that you can get at Subway. The frozen boba drinks are delish, taro being my fave flavor. Pick up a few of the steamed pork buns because they are huge with enough protein from the egg, chinese sausage and mushroom stuffing.

For more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee.   Occasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!",

Man up ya big baby.    Get down and dirty and get the #1 Combo or the Grilled Pork.  These are the only two you need to consider.  Set your alarm for Lee Sandwich and get one tomorrow.    Shakes are good, try a Durian one day and feel the burn.  I got a large and could only get through about 1/3.  I'm a big bad man, this thing made me rethink life's meaning.  Take some Steamed Buns home too, the best around!  I'm not saying that to sound cute on this website.  I'm frickin serious.  The best.  Thank you Lee's, keep doing what you do.  Keep it cash, that's bad ass, period.",

I'd love to be able to stop by and grab something on my way home.  I usually get number 11 which, to my understanding, is similar to the combination (number 1) but more. Like a combination plus, haha. I sometimes get the pork and shrimp egg rolls as well. I don't think they will be everyone's cup of tea, but I like them.   Overall, it's a great place for an inexpensive meal. Definitely stop by in you are in the area. :)",

I thought there was supposed to be tofu in it, but it was missing, so I'm not sure if I ordered wrong.  The flavors were great - so unique compared to the standard American stuff. The bread had a great crust and chew.  The only knock is the cash-only register. Uh, this is 2014 and you do operate in a strip mall. I could see a food truck being cash only - but a large operation like Lee's? Come on now kids ... must ... take ... plastico!!",

The sandwiches-both Asian and European-are uniformly delicious.  The service is just a bit slow because they only have one man working at the cash register taking orders.  The sandwiches are not made until you order them. They are probably worth the wait.  I still wish they would put in a bottle opener by the bottle drinks! This is so easy and I suggested it years ago and nothing was ever done. This makes me conclude that they do not take feedback.",

Plenty of parking in a private lot on the south-east corner of Baseline and Dobson. Eastbound access, not westbound on Baseline.  On your first visit, go during off peak times. Hint: jambon is similar to ham, and its tasty. The sandwich pictured on the menu brochure is their #11, Special Combination. Place your order at under the curved wall marked Lee Sandwiches, then go take a seat and wait for them to call the number on the top of your receipt. If you like their baguettes, they often sell day old pairs in bags for about $1.80. They're at one end of the order counter.  Don't come here if you're in a big hurry.",

I would high recommend coming here, you can customize your sandwich or whatever you get, and add on cute and fun treats. The staff is pretty friendly, we did have to wait a bit but it was well worth it. The bread was so fresh, and perfectly cooked. Everything was put together well, we liked that they gave us a number for when our order was ready - and had an announcement over the speakers so if you were wandering around you'd hear it.   There's even windows to where they bake the bread since it is all in house, such a cool little hole in the wall place.",

They're inexpensive, very tasty and perfect for a train ride.   Here, Lee's puts on an Asian spin on things. They have everything from Pork, Chicken, Vegetation and yes, even pate - served on delicious French bread, all for under $5!  You cannot go wrong.  I've been coming here for a few years with friends and co-workers and we've never been disappointed. Most sandwiches are around $4.50-ish and it's only $0.99 to add extra meat. A steal.   Another must, are Lee's tasty, slush like coffees. My favorite is their Mocha, which has a slightly different taste then the Green Mermaid's and costs less.  Expect to pay $7 to $10, which includes a soft drink or cold coffee.   Enjoy!",

I have been to this Chandler location numerous times but couldn't bring myself to write a review because I always wished they improved in someway.   Pros:  -Large open space for studying or groups -  Lots of outlets, clean - large selection of Viet Sandwiches and croissant sanwiches - Drinks like vietnamese coffee are good and smoothies are not bad -Quick service  Cons: Skimp on veggies -Baguette is a little too hard -Macarons break easily. Food quality can be inconsistent  Overall, I continue to come here because they are in a convenient location across from Lee Lees.  It's a nice place to stop for a quick lunch. They started accepting credit cards now which is a huge plus and you can phone in orders. I hope they improve on their service something is missing here and I can't put my finger on what.

So many styles and types of sandwiches, baked goods, beverages, etc. it's really hard to pick out what you want!  I decided to go with an Asian sandwich and selected the bbq pork. The pork was really good. So much flavor and the veggies were perfectly blended with each bite. The bread was good and wasn't extremely hard, which is what I was worried about initially.   I also got a hand squeezed lemonade to go with the sandwich. This is a must try for lemonade lovers.  I will be getting the lemonade again with my next sandwich choice.   Outside of the fresh food there are a lot of small Asian sweets and other little hidden gems in this place. Be sure to give it a try if you're in the mood for a great sandwich or baked good.",

    "text": "It has been a while since my last visit to Lee's Sandwiches and that was when everything was cash only, not anymore. Lee's does accept card purchases now.  I have always ordered takeout and today was no exception, I was ordering for six people today. I had my list ready of what I am going to order on my cell phone. I ordered three of the number 21, which are the Ham and Cheese on a croissant, one order of the Lee's Club on a croissant. For myself and my better half I ordered us the Grilled Chicken on a baguette and next thing I was asked if I wanted the Asian Grilled Chicken. I said of coarse, even though I never had ordered the Asian Grilled Chicken. Then again I never asked him what the difference was and I'm glad I didn't. I must say the way the sandwiches are put together you will know there is cilantro, carrots, onions, and in the Asian one, jalapeno. It's how the vegetables are sliced in such a way that you know what is in your sandwich but, you're not overwhelmed by any particular vegetable. Believe me, the way a jalapeno is sliced and perfectly place on what you're eating that jalapeno can taste delicious and that's what Lee's Sandwiches do. When I ate my sandwich I savored eat bite I took. I realize that Lee's is a sandwich place but, you really need to try it for yourself. Not all sandwiches are created equal. One thing I must add is that if you by chance have a hankering for a fresh baguette just visit when Lee's is putting out fresh ones from the oven and buy some. That's if you like their baguette as much as I do.",

I originally gave this particular store 4 stars but when I unwrapped my to-go banh mi I discovered they put a generous amount of cilantro on it when I told the cashier twice not to put it in my sandwich at all. Yes, I am one of the select few that cannot stand the soapy taste of cilantro. He repeated my order back to me before proceeding so I thought he understood. I guess not.  Overall, it was a good sandwich and I enjoyed browsing their grocery item goodies while waiting for my order.",

The menu consists of both Asian and European style sandwiches to match anyone's tastes. Any of the European sandwiches should bring a smile to your face, but be a little careful with the Asian. Unless you're used to exotic ingredients, you might not like everything they put in. They also have many other foods to order like egg/spring rolls and macaroons. You can also find a mini market of sorts here for several Asian packaged goods.   The place is big! It can easily sit any size party. They used to be cash only, with an onsite ATM. But have since recently started taking credit cards.  Give this charming little sandwich shop a try!",

I don't think it's possible to find a better tasting banh mi anywhere other than Lee's.. They do it right everytime and I am never left feeling disappointed.. This location is located right across the street from Lee Lee's Oriental Supermarket, some pho restaurants, and a boba tea shop.. Perfect for anyone that has an appreciation for Vietnamese food.. I ordered a bbq pork banh mi ($3.05) with extra pickled veges ($0.25) as well as a grilled pork banh mi with extra pickled veges for later.. Since I am rarely in this area I took the opportunity to savor the taste of a perfectly assembled banh mi.. Everything was how it should be and tasted just like the sandwiches you would get at a Lee's in the Bay Area.. A chain that is consistent always does well when their food is great in quality.. Where else will you find something this tasty for only $3 a piece? When I am visiting Chandler again I will definitely drop by to pick up a few sandwiches..",

I am filled with the anxiousness a child would have on Christmas Eve.  It really is an extended Christmas for an adult...well, an adult who really enjoys eating.  Anyways, let's begin.  The first sandwich Dave and I decided to tackle was Lee's Sandwiches' BBQ Pork Sandwich.  Lee's is located just off the 101 in Chandler.  Lee's is not exactly in my neck of the woods but this is unimportant.  I will travel great lengths to get some good grub.  The restaurant itself was quite a bit larger than I had envisioned.  This particular version of Lee's (Lee's Sandwiches is a chain) was located in a fairly nondescript strip mall.  This, of course, is no surprise to Phoenix residents.  The valley is practically one big strip mall!  After lunch Dave and I noticed that this is an area with a prevalent asian influence.  For one, there was an Asian art academy across the street.  Second, I noticed a significant asian clientele at the gas station and CVS across the street.  I'm sure the Lee's Sandwich Corporate folks did their demographic homework.  The experience reminded me of what would be seen if one were to actually travel to, say, Vietnam or China.  The colors, layout, and style all seemed to be a good representation of a fast food restaurant in some of the Asian cities.  Ok, I just realized I've been discussing everything but what I was there for, the BBQ Pork Sandwich.  I ordered the featured BBQ Pork Sandwich and because the prices were so reasonable ($2.35 for a 10\" baguette sandwich) I decided to order something a little unique.  I went out on a limb and ordered the Special Combination or Head Cheese Sandwich.  The two sandwiches and a 16 ounce iced tea came to a whopping $7 and change.  Not bad, not bad at all!  I'm not going to go into detail about the Head Cheese Sandwich.  All I will say is that it was not a very good take on head cheese.  It was too chewy and lacked the rich flavor I enjoy from head cheese.  The BBQ Pork, on the other hand, was enjoyable.  Not great but enjoyable.  This is the third or fourth sandwich I've tried that is in this style (i.e. The Tea Light Cafe).  I'm sure it's a personal preference or maybe I'm just a product of my American society but this sandwich was dry and lacks any kind of \"punch.\"  All of these Vietnamese/Chinese sandwiches are like that.  They keep getting positive reviews from the professionals but I'm not that impressed.  Personally, I need the wet component.  The sandwich doesn't have to have a sauce per se but, with all that bread, I need something to balance dry versus wet.    Now don't get me wrong, the pork was good.  It was moist, it had a nice deep red color, and it had very good flavor.  The bread (which is baked in house every day) met my expectations but doesn't exactly warrant a baking award.  All in all, it was ok; however, when you consider the price it is an above average value.  If you were asking me, I'd tell you not to go out of your way to try Lee's Sandwiches but if you're in the area and on a fast-food budget, check 'em out.  **********************  For the first time ever, I present my \"M-m-m-m-m\" rating system.  The lowest rating being one \"M\" and the best of the best being five \"M's\" for a rating of \"M-m-m-m-m!\"  I give the BBQ Pork Sandwich:  Two \"M's\"    for a    M-m",

I've had sandwiches in more authentic places and honestly, they werent that much better. For those people who are not so keen into the Vietnamese style sandwiches they do have delicious sandwiches on buttery broissants for not too much more. Lee's seems to do a little bit of everything, and they do it pretty decently. The smoothies and boba here are pretty run of the mill, nothing too special. The gelato is sub-par compared to other places nearby. However, the danishes and baked goods are pretty good and all for a good price. I would stay away from the lettuce-ridden goi-cuon(vietnamese summer rolls) and the pate chauds which are more of a hassle to clean up than anything and way too much work to get at the tiny ball of pate in the middle. Some shining stars there are the grilled pork sandwich, the special combination sandwich, and the hot ham and cheese croissant pastries(make sure to get there early so these are fresh).  Don't forget to bring cash although they do have an atm right in the middle of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Banh mi or Vietnamese sandwiches bespoke of the French colonial occupation of Vietnam and their influence on Vietnamese cuisine.  The many, many varieties available at Lee's showcase this.  The baguettes are done reasonably well though its mainly a matter of preference ( I've had friends say that they are too hard and others say that they are too small or skinny), I find them quite acceptable.  The favorites and ones usually most ordered by the Asian customers tend to be the Banh mi's.  There are western styles based on croissant as well as baguettes.  The croissant texture is good and the taste buttery.  Though again complaint range from not being enough \"fluffy\" to \"too buttery\".   The drinks are vietnamese style iced and fruit drinks ranging from durian, mango, etc. to penny wort.  Iced coffee is fantastic though it may seem very small but the caffeine kick definitely lets you know its European origins.   Gelato is present and its a shame more people don't get it because its well made and quite a bargain.   Spring rolls are great and really addictive.  Pork buns are ok.  The pate pastries are great as well as the other sweet rolls and muffins. I've not had any of the other things like the imported butter so I leave that to any of you to comment. I've had many banh mi's in Garden Grove (Little Saigon) and in Los Angeles as well as in San Diego.  As my Vietnamese friends tell me, Lee's are OK.  There are definitley better ones but I give them 4 stars for coming out to Arizona and setting up a well run sandwich shop and giving fairly affordable and tasty food.",

Some people (me) like it that way.  If you like soft bread stay away or get croissante sandwiche.  3. Some of the baked goods are good.   4. The sandwiches are inexpensive but don't have a huge amount of meat.   Again I like this - just telling you.",

Also, a friend of mine go the bbq pork sandwich (based on my recommendation) and they totally skimped out on the meat portion. The sandwich had a few little sprinkles of meat here and there, so basically his sandwich consisted of mostly french bread and pickles. He didn't like it and thought I hyped it up...LOL! After my yucky meatball sub I probably won't go back unless I'm in the neighborhood and really craving some good french bread.",

Every single time I'm here, I always buy copious amounts of food so I can take some home, because it's like an hour and a half away from my house (one way).   Their baguettes are so crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sandwiches have a good crunch with the pickled veggies and a nice spice with the thinly sliced jalapenos.   The egg roll filling is a nice texture, not overly salty, and has a good mix of flavors, slightly peppered, with chicken and shrimp. My honey can eat like 10 of them. You can get 20 for $14.99, or 5 for $3.99  Their \"lee's coffee\" which is coffee with sweetened condensed milk is nothing less than amazing. So yummy.   Recently they started carrying macarons. Best decision ever. I tried the green tea macaron. It was perfect. The matcha was balanced perfectly in the filling and macaron, which a lot of places fail at.  Word of advice? It's cash only. Always bring cash. Their ATM was out of service this time. I had to go to Walgreens next door, and their ATM was out of service too. It wasn't a huge deal, but that was kind of annoying. The limit for cash back at Walgreens was $20, and I really wanted to buy a ton of egg rolls to bring home.",

When I was younger my parents use to always stop by Lee's Sandwiches during our road trips around California. We bought at least 10 sandwiches on our way back home and they would all be eaten by the time we made it back to Arizona. So you can see how extremely happy we were when Lee's Sandwiches opened in Arizona several years ago.  The sandwich shop is a fusion of Vietnamese and French. A lot of the ingredients used and the stuff they sell including the snacks and drinks are from asian origin, but don't let this turn you away. They have traditional ham and turkey as well.   Usually I get the vietnamese coffee, but this time around I decided to order the sugarcane drink. It was delicious!! I saw the way they made the drink and it was freshly squeezed from a real sugarcane. I think I found my new favorite drink!",

Without question I should have gone for the other half of the menu, as it's their specialty.  I will come back, but was not even close to blown away by their club sandwich.   Also, it's 2015 - I just don't like it when businesses don't bother to have the ability to take debit / credit cards.  Yes, I get what you're doing.  You own the ATM that's fifteen feet away and thus customers are forced to pay your stupid fee.

The avocado smoothie I was disappointed in.. I could've gone to a boba place across the street, but I was already there.

(not a pork patty, REAL meat)  This sandwich has a following of devotees just like the McRib.  Only difference is that these followers prefer FOOD to \"food like substance\" (see Mcribwich episode of Simpsons; it was voted the #1 meat flavored sandwich) Not at lee's...This is real fresh made bread, real meat and fast service.  For breakfast I like the croissant sandwiches.  They are HUGE and super fresh.    I've been to California's best and I will admit there are some amazing mom and pop shops there, but for a chain this is the tops.  We are in a desert, far from Asia, but it's so nice to get some authentic sandwiches so far from their origin.  Most lunch customers I see buy their take out baguettes to eat at home with dinner. for 99 cents you cant go wrong!",

My choice of the many varieties of Banh Mi (three times!) is the \"Bar-B-Que Pork\" and it is fabulous! It is loaded with pickled carrot, daikon radish, cilantro, onion and jalapeno. \"Grilled Pork\" will my next choice, as it is highly recommended by several Reviewers.

You cannot beat the prices, $3-$5 for a fresh sandwich and the best French Baguettes or croissants if you prefer!

So I'm going into this lunch blind knowing absolutely nothing about this place. And I get there and look at the picture of the vegetarian sandwich on the wall and it looks horrible. HORRIBLE! So I think to myself, if they're advertising something that looks that horrendously awful how good could the food be? So I'm there with my boy Richard Z and he's like \"Dude, don't be stupid. The food here is good.\"  So I don't believe him. I say \"This is suspect.\" So I text my bird who's driving there and I say, \"Have you actually eaten here before? This place is suspect.\" Now, the Bird's having a bad day and she's like \"*@*&#^&%$)@$#&*@#^*&@!!!\" I respond \"Ok, can't wait to see you, Suga.\" I was all smiles are charms yesterday.   So she gets there and I'm in such a good mood I can't even contain myself enough to order so she is forced to order for me and she orders me what she orders herself, which is a Tai tea with boba and an egg salad sammy. Despite my initial reservations I was pleasantly surprised. It was really freakin' good. Tai tea with boba was interesting. An aquired taste that I was able to aquire 3/4 of the way through.   So today, feeling less like a petulant child and more like a man. A man's man... I went back to get the actual sammy that I wanted yesterday but was too fricken angry to order. What, do you ask, drove me back the next day? The veggie avacado on a croisant. Other than the avacado being kinda gross, the sandwich was absolutely amazing. So I would recommend this place to my grandmother with a weak stomach. It's just really good. I'm sorry, dearest Lady, for my tresspasses.",

I love it so much I call it \"Mr. Lee's\" because a place this good deserves my respect.   My usual sandwich is the Asian Vegetable which consists of carrots, daikon radish (I think?), vermicelli (like the fried rice noodles that top a Chinese Chicken Salad), tofu (fried bits?), cilantro, and fresh jalapeno on a wonderful baguette. The flavors and textures are awesome and it's actually pretty light and healthy.   If you are not as adventurous as I am, the Euro Sandwiches are AMAZING. You could serve a steaming pile of dog crap on one of their croissants and it would be delicious. Their muffins are really good too.   My absolute favorite thing from Lee's also happens to be one of the top 10 best things I've ever put in my mouth. It is called pate choud and I could eat it all day every day. Pate choud consists of a small meatball (chicken or pork) surrounded by layers of the most delectable, buttery, flaky, crispy layers of pastry known to humankind. There are not words that can express the wondrousness of it all....so just try it. You can get a little two biter for 75 cents or a bigger one for $1.50.",

    "text": "4-stars for value.  Great place to fill up on cheap, tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket.  Menu offers: - European sandwiches - Asian sandwiches - Gourmet coffee - Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas - Housemade ice cream  We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.    Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.  Our standard picks are:  #1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20 - ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate - great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)  # 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20 - Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill  Cafe Sua Da $2.20  - Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice - Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream - As much caffeine as a quadruple shot  Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.  Remember cash only.",

    "text": "Since I'm returning to Arizona for a week come January, I'm gonna review some favorites from my time in the Grand Canyon state. This could be partially out of anticipation to re-visit places I miss about the Phoenix metro area, or it could be the realization that Yelp allows me to step outside my current East Coast community to provide the straight dope on places I've a decent grasp on. One such place is Lee's, and while this review is being made two years after I left Arizona, I can only hope not much has changed.  Lee's is an awesome little place to grab a sandwich and a smoothie. The sandwich options range from Bahn Li (Vietnamese) to certain basics, but all are unique enough that they taste very much \"Lee's.\" It would be easy to say this is because of the bread, but saying that would discredit the overall quality of Lee's goods. From the fresh tasting filler to the amazingly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside bread surrounding it, a Lee's sandwich is most definitely awesome.   But my most common purchase at Lee's wasn't the delicious sandwiches, the kick ass baguettes, or the buttery croissants. There was something else that Lee's provided that was the drink equivalent of crack-cocaine.   Smoothies - with Boba.   I've had boba elsewhere, but something about Lee's wide and diverse smoothies selection really made the difference. The boba pearls here were of damn good size and quality too, which is more than I can say for other places that serve them. The only issue is that Lee's would occasionally run out of Boba, but the disappointment was always mitigated because the delicious sandwich was fallback enough.  My girlfriend and I would frequent Lee's when we were both in Arizona, and for the week vacation I'm planning on reuniting with it in grand fashion. Keep your eyes open, guys - I gotta make up for time missed.",

    "text": "Bahn mi. It's such a strange choice for a favorite food. It smacks of pretentious doucheyness found in the worst of all foodies: \"Well, if I had MY choice for a meal, it would DEFINITELY be the scottish red-legged partridge found at The French Laundry followed by their DIVINE jivara-caramel roulade.\"  Go get a hobby and a sense of scale, Buttmunch.  And yet, I can't deny that bahn mis are one of my favorite foods. The mix of crusty starches, savory meats and piquant herbage is a combination bestowed to us from the gods above.  Just the fact that I typed that last sentence makes me want to give myself a much-deserved cockpunch.  So, after an aborted attempt to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, it was with much interest and anticipation that I walked into Lee's Sandwiches.  I was only dimly aware of Lee's the Chain due to the inevitable comparisons West Coast ex-pats have made of a local (to Atlanta) bahn mi shop named \"Lee's Bakery.\" In an interesting twist of reverse reviewing, I've turned the tables on them thar Lee's.  First thought.  Bright. Shiny, even. It was 8:30 at night and I feel like I walked into a three dimensional anime. I ordered the BBQ pork combo and a side of fried spring rolls. Oh, it's cash only. Fortunately, I've got it and I noticed the ATM inhouse. But dammit, this screws up my expense reporting for work. Oh well.  The order doesn't take long to arrive. I sit and assess. The fried spring rolls are awesome. In fact, to my Filipino eye, the look (and ultimately taste) like lumpia. Mmmmmm.....lumpia. But as for the sandwich? It was......okay. I've had better. (Sigh.) The baguette was crunchy and soft in all the right places. I could probably eaten a few more loaves of that stuff. But, speaking of stuff, the stuffing, the interior of the sandwich was lacking. The meat portion was almost minuscule or at least compared to my hometown Lee's it was. Still, a mediocre bahn mi is still a good sandwich in my book. Three stars as far as bahn mis go, but four stars compared to other places in general.",

    "text": "How often do you come across a real treasure?  Once every couple of years?  Well, the Chandler AZ treasure of 2007 is Lee's Sandwiches, and I wish them much success.  Why I Give Mad Props to Lee's Sandwiches: 1. They have outdoor seating with mist-ers to keep customers cool, even at 110 degrees. 2. Add a statuesque actor in trademark John Wayne Gasey white makeup & a gondola canal inside, and you'd have the Venetian.  Then again, maybe not, but there is a mini concave rotunda built into the ceiling, painted with the colors of the wind. 3. They have a baguette factory.  Watch stainless steel machinery crank out French style loaves, while you and your chums enjoy an affordable meal in the dining area. 4. Eighteen different flavors of gelato. 5. They have a Deli Manjoo cream cake counter, with colorful carrying cases for to-go orders. 6. Fresh bread, fresh whole cilantro and thinly sliced fresh jalapenos joined forces to awaken sleepy taste buds. 7. The stylish Lance Armstrong style rubber bracelet which was affixed to each sandwich to keep the wrapper on tight.  Okay, it was just a sixteenth of an inch wide and only came in white.  What do you all want for nothing?  A rubber biscuit? 8. The low low prices. 9. My meal provided me with a front row seat to the putrid-pudding-stampede, at no additional cost.  Why I Put Lee's Sandwiches on Blast: 1. They don't take plastic... but they do have a shifty looking ATM against the wall. 2. The sweetly pickled julienned carrot sticks which were strategically placed on my meatball and bbq pork subs.  I didn't find the extra crunch to be an appealing augmentation. 3.  Some of the aromas emitted from behind the counter were not altogether inviting.  Finally, I found the cashier to be very friendly.  When I walked in with only a Hamilton, and the bill came to $10.11, guess who covered my shortage?  That's right, Nicole the benevolent cashier.  ~Swoop",

I always stop by when we visit home from LA because it's supposed to be cheap and reliably good food like it is when I'm in Garden Grove near LA. But this place has tiny portions! Our sandwiches were a good 3-4 inches shorter, the large croissant was the size of a small one in Garden Grove...same prices because it's a franchise, but shouldn't that mean they have the same sizes too? So sad. Sure it tasted the same but half the appeal of Lee's is the wonderful deal you get!",

There are also a few other places around the valley that for me are a bit more tasty and just as cheap..

    "text": "This place is so damn awesome. First off it's dirt cheap. Sandwiches are about $2.50 to $3.00 a piece and if you want something really good, go for the more exotic ones. My favorite is their meatball which doesn't sound exotic at all but its a fresh french roll filled with Asian style meatballs, pickled vegetables, cilantro and fresh sliced jalapenos. So, so good! It's spicy though but it's one of the yummiest, cheapest things you'll ever eat (and as for the spicy, my toddler eats it so put on your big girl panties and quit complaining).   The next best thing on the menu is their Lee's iced coffee. It's espresso and sweetened condensed milk served over ice. Sounds a little different, but it's heaven in a cup. The sweetened condensed milk balances out the bitterness of the espresso and the hot concoction melts the ice to the perfect viscosity for your libationary enjoyment. Hmmmm. I could go for one now.   You can get this uncommonly delicious meal for about $5. What more could you ever want?",

He makes everyones first experiences at Lee's a complete and total disaster.   If you're someone who wants to order wings/eggrolls.

The cilantro and the jalepenos adds even more flavor! My taste senses have a party each time I eat one of these. I usually order a boba smoothie to go with my sandwich and their smoothies are consistently well made (no chunks of ice and very creamy). The boba has perfect texture and I can tell they just made it. Free Wi-Fi, clean restrooms and eating area, makes this place suitable for small gatherings.

The only thing I wish they'd have is roast pork sandwiches like they used to where it began in San Jose California  The barbecue pork is the staple and I now like the mixed veggie sandwich as well.....commercializing! I saw Starbucks Frapachino in the beverage case! Come on Vietnamese coffee doesn't need that competition!",

In fact, I haven't gone in quite some time because I hate that part of the city, so now that they're nearby in Chandler, I'll get my fix while I can, even if their sammies are skinnier than those in sF.

This is not a fancy sandwich shop...with that being said, don't come here expecting a sandwich piled 6 inches high that not even Fat Albert could finish. What you can expect is a good sandwich at a very decent price.   They are cash only and that is how they keep their costs low. There's an ATM in the lobby in case you forget to stop at the bank.   I love the variety of sandwiches they have ranging from a basic croissant ham and cheese to a grilled pork on a freshly baked (in house) baguette. The pate pouches are super tasty and good for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   They have over 30 types of smoothies so you are sure to find a flavor you love or try a new one you haven't yet. My favorites are the avocado and taro ones. Sounds odd, but they are very refreshing! I can't wait to get back to Arizona to try new items!",

I had no idea that this is a cash only place, after completing my order verbally the cashier informed cash only! I'm starving so he pointed to the ATM machine inside, I reluctantly walked up to machine because I knew there would ATM fees but didn't care.  Sure enough, I see a message on the screen saying \"dispensing error\" after agreeing to pay $1.75 in fees to withdraw $20.  Cash did not dispense, I got a print out clearly showing the amount deducted from my account.  I also logged into my mobile banking app and it showed the ATM transaction that funds had been deducted but it was pending.   I returned to the cashier and showed him the transaction on my mobile banking app, he basically said \"wait for 3-5 days...\" For a refund!!! What???? I couldn't believe the response! Later, he said that it was not their machine! It's on your damn property inside the restaurant, but he didn't care!   Typical rude and unprofessional service, gangnam style!!!   Forget this place and DO NOT use their ATM!!!!",

If you are unfamiliar with Bahn Mi, it's a Vietnamese sandwich using a baguette bread. \"Bahn\" means: bread and \"Mi\" means: wheat.   I would definitely recommend getting their #11 which is the special combo loaded with everything. (Cold cut meat: sliced pork, pork bellies, pork sausage, liver pate, head cheese) and some veggies for garnish (cilantro, carrots, jalapeno and cucumbers). These are definitely easy to eat and tasteful! I usually always order 5+ every time I visit because it's so good and we don't have this in Tucson!   Also if you check in on Yelp, you get one free Vietnamese coffee. Which is a strong iced espresso drink with condense milk! Also another recommendation.   The only downfall is the price is a bit high from what I've see in California. A sandwich running approximately $5 a sandwich and in California it's approximately $3-$4 a sandwich.   \"Taste it, love it, Yelp it!\"",

I understand that keeping their prices low means saving on merchant credit card fees, but sometimes I want to grab a quick sandwich...ooofff forget I don't have cash... don't want to get hosed and lose more money to fees at their atm machine which seems to not work the few times I've been in... so I move onto another shop.  All in all, Still love the flavor and food there, will continue to go whenever I remember to get cash.  For the East Valley area with lack of Asian sandwiches it does fulfill my cravings, I've had better in CA other states, but I still like them so yeah I'll keep supporting.",

I must agree with others that they are skimping on the meat more and more each day.  AND today they skimped on the cilantro and pickled carrots/daikon.  SERIOUSLY?!  Have no clue why the wait is so long since they have so many employees standing around.  The french coffee is not traditional since they don't actually use a presser on each order, but instead its pre-mixed from their corporate office and tastes a bit chemical like.

The bread for the sandwiches *is* fantastic. The amount of meat used in the banh mi could be better. I always order extra meat... 3 years ago, it was noticeable. These days, it almost seems like you get less meat if you pay for extra! D: Of course the roast pork Banh Mi is tasty tasty, but give the European sandwiches (croissants) a whirl too! I especially love the  roast beef! Also, big flatscreens playing FOX NEWS is kind of difficult to look at while dining... this should be a 2 star review, because of that! :P",

Vietnamese restaurants are always dirty, run down, and seemingly ill-maintained. Lee's couldn't be any different, it's clean, shiny, and efficient. Ordering takes place at the counter, and they have about 20+ sandwiches you can choose from, both american and vietnamese. Vietnamese are under $3 and american are over $4 and not nearly as delicious.   I wasn't courageous enough to try the signature Lee's Combonation, because it has Head Cheese (it's not cheese) and I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to that stuff. I had decided before I went that I would have the Grilled Pork, they were out, so as a back up I ordered the BBQ pork, which they were out of. I settled for Shredded Pork, and it was fairly good.  I'm going to go back and order something that fits my tastes, but as of now based on my experience there, it's only 3 stars. The shredded pork sandwich wasn't tremendous, and they were out of too many things. Shouldn't happen. For price and cleanliness though, this place is great.",

Grilled pork w/out the \"mayo\" when it's being packed away (is it really mayo??).  Sometimes the fried 5 egg roll deal comes on the trip too.  Hot summer days is nice to sip on an iced chrysanthemum tea with black grass jelly.  BTW I saw a location just a few miles from Disneyland, if you're planning to pack in a little there too.",

They've got a bunch of stuff on the menu but I always order the same thing, the #11 Special which runs a whopping $3.15.  You get a very fresh foot long baguette with a few slices of processed pork and lots of fresh vegies and cilantro.  It's quick, delicious and refreshing.  It's a cleaned up version of pretty much any Hanoi Banh Mi joint, which is to say, it's just fine.",

    "text": "I would rate this 3 stars on my banh mi sandwich scale but they get the one extra star for being the only one around out in this area. I used to live in Monterey Park, CA where banh mi shops were on every other corner and Lee's would probably be somewhere on the middle of my list of preferences. But I'm grateful to have this one out here in Chandler. Hey, beggars can't be choosers right?  I usually alternate between the grilled pork, cha (pork roll), and xiu mai (meatball) banh mi, with the grilled pork one being more frequent. The flavor is awesome. Meatballs are not the meatball with marinara type of sandwich. They are ground pork mixed with veggies formed into big round balls and steamed. There are about 4 large ones in each sandwich, I think. Each sandwich comes with pickled veggies (shredded carrots and daikon), sliced onions, jalapenos, and sprigs of cilantro and served on a 10 inch baguette that is baked in house. Their cafe sua da is good, too. It's strong, dripped vietnamese coffee with condensed milk over ice. Might make you feel cracked out if you are not a daily coffee drinker, like me.  My favorite thing here, however,  is the AVOCADO SMOOTHIE! Avocado Smoothie??? Ewww! You might think. That's what my coworkers said and now they are serious fans. If you like avocados... you will like this smoothie, trust.  Don't forget to bring cash unless you want to pay ATM fees. Or stop by Walgreens for a pack of gum and get cash back. Probably can use some gum for the hot breath you will get after eating the pickled veggies on your sandwich. Win-win.",

I got the grilled pork and I think it was just cut up cheap ham.  I was horrified at this abomination of a Lee's after having talked so much shit to my wife about how good it was.  It was painfully all right.  No green waffles, no chuoi nep nuong, no assorted treats layed out just so.  Not a young coconut in site.  They did have the fresh squeezed sugarcane juice I have come to love.  But it still has nothing on Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu's sugarcane and kumquat explosion.    I sadly went away with a large baguette and the hopelessness of knowing Arizona is missing out big on the REAL Lee's Sandwiches experience and that is a mofo shame...",

Tip: Go get to the Walgreen's next door, buy something and get cash-back that way. Saves you a trip to the bank.  Value is good but I really wish they can make these improvements!",

I mean, it is a sandwhich that costs $3.05 so I really shouldn't complain, but both times I have gone here there was very little pork on my sandwhich at the flavor of the pork wasn't even close to as awesome as the taste of the bread. So yeah, maybe for the future this is my new \"go to\" bakery in the area and I will just make my own sandwhiches at home with their baguettes. :)",

I ordered the combo #11 and a thai iced tea.

This wasn't a problem for me, because places that only take cash are usually  less expensive - those credit machines aren't free to run!  The sandwich was good - I had Jambon, Provolone on baguette minus that lovely thing called pate. I'm NOT a fan of pate. It was delish. Tender ham, good cheese, neat atmospher. And they have Jones Soda's - which I always love.  I didn't get to try the DeLi Manjoo, so I'll have to go back! But those suckers look amazing!  Nothing remarkable - but it's a solid sandwich shop with incredibly reasonable prices!",

I like Lee's because they keep it very clean and organized inside.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches (not just banh mi) and other assorted goodies, plus a bevy of drinks to quench your thirst.  Their ingredients and bread have been fresh every time I've gone in, and what this results in is me stuffing my face, all the while going \"nom nom nom\", and thinking about the ladies from the Nom Nom Truck...oops sorry, I'm daydreaming again!  If you've never had banh mi, you might think that it is weird to get a bbq pork sandwich with parsley, carrots, pickled radish and sliced jalapenos, but I implore you to try one.  You just might not go back to regular sandwiches.  The only downside is that they only take cash, but then again, it ultimately saves you some dough (worth it!).  If you're like me and would rather just not eat than pay an ATM fee, you might not care, but they do have an ATM machine (or two, I'm not sure) if you forget to bring cash.",

    "text": "Hankering for a tasty bahn mi (baguette sandwich)?  Placed in the Asian enclave at Warner & Dobson, this gem is definitely the best sandwich place in the valley.   The bakery is authentically Vietnamese and French.  Pick up tins of real French butter, crusty baguettes, small or large croissants, French horns filled with creme anglais, tasty hot puff pastries filled will pate, crunch friend shrimp and pork egg roll, Vietnamese spring rolls, or get yourself either a freshly made Vietnamese or French style baguette (or croissant) sandwich.   Don't stop there.  They have ice cream, smoothies and iced coffee (which is sadly mostly ice - the only criticism I could make about this place), muffins, cookies...  Get there early, and by that I mean when they open, and you can also get Deli Manjoo, little creme filled cakes they sell by the box-full.  They quickly run out, and like the True artists they are they only make a certain amount, and when they're gone, that's it.   My favorite things to order here are the sardine or vegetarian banh mi's.  They both have the picked carrot and daikon you come to expect on anything Vietnamese, but also cilantro and hot peppers.  The Sardines certainly have some tomato sauce, the vegetarian have tasty strips of deep fried tofu.  Scrumptious!  Service is quick and efficient, no small talk.  Be warned, they don't take cards and the cash machine in the store charges like $2.  Don't grumble, they've passed the savings on to you.  Bon appetite!",

The place was not very busy.  My wife ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a steam bun.  I ordered a B.B.Q Pork sandwich.  The croissant and ham were both hard.  The steam bun was soft and mushy.  Both were probably left on the warmer for a long time.  When you look at the sandwich, you can't see anything until you open the bread.  It was nothing like the picture.  I was expecting a lot more ingredients.  There was a thin layer of B.B.B Pork and vegetables.  The bread was pretty good.  I might go back and give it another try.  Hopefully the food will be a bit better.",

After standing in front of the menu for what seemed to be the greater part of my day I decided on the latter two.   I honestly did not expect to get how much I did for only $6.
