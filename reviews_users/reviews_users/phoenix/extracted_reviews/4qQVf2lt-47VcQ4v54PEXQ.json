Great!!  The filling consisted of the ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts , sun dried tomatoes.  Just great, perfect size for sharing.  Good food and great service, we'll definitely be back!",

I came here a few months ago and had a great time. It is extremely bare bones but the people and the food are what make this 5 star. I had the best pizza of my life here by some guy walking around in pajamas--it was one of the owners. This is a small shop where you feel like family. Delicious food and personal service make this an easy 5 star.",

The fact that Basil & Garlic is BYOB is awesome!  We own a ton of nice bottles of wine and love to bring it as opposed to paying twice as much for the same bottle at a nice restaurant.    The food is only okay.  The pizzas are large and the crust seems to be a bit soggy from all of the toppings.  I had this pizza at the restaurant one time & to-go another, both with the same results.  I've had better pizza - in the neighborhood you can try Fate, Il Bosco, or Pomo for much better pizza.    It was pretty empty both times that we went to Basil & Garlic - I'm not sure why everyone who reviews it notes that they had to wait.  We had 0 wait and it seemed a bit weird that no one else was there.    Overall, the food is fine, but it doesn't live up to all of the hype.  Maybe try the pasta dishes instead of pizza.",

    "text": "Was taken here for my birthday and was our first time in. Couldn't have been more disappointed in almost everything. While True it is a small place they had a table of about 8 which seemed to overwhelm the staff although our server, Ruth, did an admirable job.  We started with the $10 Calamari appetizer. Took awhile and when it came out it was tasteless and rubbery. Our server apologized and graciously offered to replace it. An offer we accepted. Second time, no better and we weren't charged.  Then we shared a small dinner salad which was nice enough although when they say small, they mean it. Served on a small side plate. Was tasty enough but hey, it's assembly and not cooking. Bread and butter were served with the salad. It was nothing special but ok. Hard to believe the bread was made in house as claimed.  Then best of all I ordered the Chef's signature dish, Chef Claudio's Favorite: Sauteed Fresh Mushrooms, Ham, Red Onions and Peas delicately simmered in a rosa cream sauce, baked in an oven with mozzarella cheese. $16.95  Chef's signature dish should be done right shouldn't it? And if you are truly a trained chef specializing in Italian cuisine you wouldn't use ham would you? Or if you DID use ham it wouldn't taste like it was cheap lunchmeat ham would it? It would be some sort of Italian ham like a prosciutto or maybe a capocolla wouldn't it? Nope, just plain old cheap tasting lunchmeat ham.  So mediocre to poor food and a very, very noise kitchen make for a poor meal which we won't attempt to repeat.",

I've driven by the little strip center hundreds of times, and never given it a glance.  What a gem!!  Fantastic little italian bistro, we've been back virtually every weekend since!!  Claudio and Nadine and their staff are very friendly and welcoming.  After that first visit learning that they were BYOB, we bring a bottle of our favorite wine with us for a great little dinner out.  Love their Pizza (grabbed one to take home and watch the Super Bowl!!), their Stromboli's ... the Chicken Parm sandwhich ... were both fantastic.  We are working our way through their menu, really enjoyed the Pasta dishes I've tried too.    Just reading through other reviews as well, and realizing that we weren't the first to stumble upon Basil & Garlic!  I agreed with all the positives I was reading in other reviews!

When you walk in you are greeted by the 2 owners who run the place and seem to do all the cooking. They know what they're doing.  We ordered the b&g special sandwich which is baked chicken, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. Awesome flavor. I'm craving it right now just thinking about it.  We also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my little guy. It's was his first time having pizza and he loved it. I loved it as well because I got the leftovers.  My wife ordered a \"personal\" pizza. It was more than enough for 1 person. She added artichokes, broccoli, and eggplant. The eggplant was strips of fried deliciousness. I'm a carnivore but I loved it. The wife was very impressed.  All in all this place is great. Non-assuming family run place with amazing food. The pizza is as good as any pizza I have ever had. Can't wait to go back!",

After cruising yelp, we found Basil & Garlic Bistro, and it did not dissapoint!   Hidden away in a strip mall, we would have never known it was there by just driving past it. A True hidden gem.   One of the cool things about this joint is that it's a BYOB restaurant, and even better, there is a store right next to Basil & Garlic that has a wide variety of wine to purchase.  We requested a seat outside to enjoy the nice spring weather and ordered up an appetizer of cheesy garlic bread. So good! I was unsure of what to order, but then I looked a table over and saw chicken parm, so I had to have that.   The portions here are good sized, and reasonably priced. The food here is really good, quite surprising considering the quaint location. I could only have about half my entree before I needed a box.   Service was top notch also. Very friendly wait staff and the wait for our food was not long at all. I do recommend making reservations as the inside is small, and if you want to eat outside there are not that many tables.   When we do come back to Scottsdale next year, we will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Just finished my second time at this restaurant.  I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4, for a few reasons.  I had previously visited and sat on the patio and had a great experience and have really been anxious to return.  This place has great reviews but there are a couple things that deserve noting.  First and foremost, the food is very, very good which is obviously the most important thing and why I still feel they deserve 4 stars.  However, we waited a long time for bread that was hard with cold butter and no knives to spread it with.  We were absolutely starving and so we devoured it anyway.  I did not know it was BYOB-I'll have to note that for if I return.  We had to sit inside as it was extremely busy.  The inside is bustling with activity.  It does remind me of a little trattoria you might come upon in Italy.  But the staff is a little too casual-we heard more than a few curse words coming from the kitchen (with small children in tow).  Also our waitress came in from the patio and was loudly telling the chef about a customer who was complaining about the way her chicken was cooked and they all proceeded to roll their eyes and bad mouth the customer, in front of us who were dining.  That is completely inappropriate.  We also had to ask for water numerous times.  And the bathroom hadn't been taken care of, lacking paper towels and what not. As mentioned, the food is great but at this price point I feel they could improve on a few things.  I think they may have been understaffed but the paying customers shouldn't have to suffer by not having appropriate silverware and having to ask repeatedly for water.  I guarantee that wouldn't happen in Italy!  The bottom line is the last time I dined here I wished I lived closer so I could be a regular, and this time leaves me wondering if I will come back.",

    "text": "Home-style Italian food. My husband and I are vegetarians, so the choices are ofcourse limited. We ordered Cheese Fries, Quattro Formaggi and the Chef's Special (vegetarian version). I was told that I could call in advance to order a vegetarian lasagne. We preferred the outdoor seating to the inside of the restaurant. Staff are very pro-active in helping you pick menu items to suit your taste. They also check on you often to make sure you are comfortable. Food was great and had a homely feel ... no fancy plating or over-the-top names! We'll definitely go back to try the pizzas!",

    "text": "Tonight, I needed a calzone. After consulting my handy-dandy Yelp app, I was down to two nearby options: NYPD and Basil & Garlic Bistro. Since I've never been to Basil & Garlic, since it was very highly reviewed by other Yelpers I've learned to trust, and since it has two of my very favorite ingredients right in its name, my conclusion was an obvious one.  Turns out, Basil & Garlic Bistro is less than two miles from where I live, so the trip was unexpectedly short and memorable. The storefront itself is unassuming and, unless you're specifically on the hunt for it, very easy to miss. I've driven by the plaza it's situated in dozens of times before without noticing its existence. (I'll need to level up my observation skillz...)  Upon entering, I was immediately greeted and invited to sit anywhere. Looking around the small dining area, I realized I was the only one there. (It was a little after 3:30p on a Saturday afternoon - an admittedly inconspicuous in-between time.) I was very ok with being alone to experience this lovely bistro for the very first time.  My server's name was Ruth. She was a wonderfully sweet and polite girl with a pleasing sense of calm humor about her. I felt instantly at ease. Ruth was excited to tell me about the Chef's Choices for the night, rattling off an impressive and detailed list of three distinct (and delicious-sounding!) pasta options - enough to make any mouth drool from anticipation.  I remained stalwart in my plans to consume a calzone, however, and ordered mine with pepperoni in place of the usual ham, as well as an addition of house garlic. The calzone and stromboli both come in \"small\" and \"large\" sizes, but Ruth assured me that the \"small\" calzone would, in fact, be quite large, and likely more than enough food for me.  Taking her advice, I ordered the \"small\". Not long afterward, the food was served and Ruth was NOT kidding. The \"small\" calzone here is easily comparable to the \"large\" calzone at NYPD, if not just a smidge bigger. It also comes with a good-sized tub of house-made marinara, which is something I always look for, because I like to use a lot.  Judging simply from the smell of the calzone, I knew it was going to be delicious, and I was not the least bit disappointed. Very honestly, the Basil & Garlic Bistro calzone was one of the very best I've ever eaten. Not only that, I had nearly half left over to take home after eating my fill. Asking for a box, Ruth was quick to bring one and even boxed everything up for me!  When I gathered my things to leave, both Ruth and her coworker were on the phone taking orders, so I wasn't able to wave goodbye as I would have liked, but one of the chef's caught me leaving from all the way back in the kitchen and made a point of calling out a heartfelt, \"Thank you - have a good night!\" Such a small thing... But it actually meant a lot to me.  CONCLUSION  For a quiet, somewhat lonely, winter night, I could not have been any happier with my visit to Basil & Garlic Bistro. The setting is intimate and warm, the service was BEYOND exceptional, the food was spectacular, portions were significantly larger than expected, and prices were more than fair.  If you've never been to Basil & Garlic Bistro before, bookmark it! Make an excuse to come experience some wonderfully authentic Italian fare in a truly homestyle setting and be sure to tip well - the staff deserves it, many times over. If you're bringing a larger group, I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations since space is somewhat limited.  A NOTE TO THE HOSTS  Basil & Garlic Team - THANK you for working so hard to provide such an inviting atmosphere. Ruth, thank YOU for being my friend for the night. Mr. Chef, thank you for catching me on my way out. You all made me feel right at home, and I couldn't be more pleased, or more grateful. Keep up the good work, and I'll do whatever I can to send more hungry folks your way!",

She recommended the Cheese Steak Deluxe which i was hesitant ordering, was mind blowing! The bread & the meat was perfectly paired making it the best cheese Steak in Arizona. We also had the Basil & Garlic pasta dish which we were told it was an explosion of flavor & it defitnaty didn't disappoint us.   Shannon delivers remarkable service & makes you feel like part of the family. It's a small family owned business which makes me feel good to support. You will see the owner working side by side with his staff in the front or in the back. You can see in his staff how well they are treated & everyone helps everyone. Very refreshing to see an old fashioned ran resturant. Bravo!!",

    "text": "Found this place on yelp and bookmarked it right away, I was very excited to try this place out today! As a vegetarian and a fairly healthy eater, pizza is my guiltiest food pleasure. I know my pizza..and the pizza here is absolutely delicious.  This is definitely a hole in the wall type place, kind of oddly placed in a neighborhood. The restaurant is very tiny, as other reviews said, nothing fancy decor-wise. My boyfriend and I were the only two people at the restaurant, but we went at a weird time.  The two people working there were very kind and welcoming to us, I was happy with the service.   I had a hard time deciding what to order because the menu is massive, I will have to come back and try out the eggplant parmesan sandwich. I followed my pizza-loving gut and went for the individual size cheese pizza and added tomatoes as a topping. Beware: the individual size is huge. I usually eat a ton, and I wasn't even able to get through half of this pizza. One great thing is that they make their own dough for the pizza and bread. The crust was incredible. My meal tasted very authentic, this is up there with some of the best pizza I have enjoyed in the state of Arizona.   The price is great too, got a ton of food for a very low price. Was probably the least expensive sit-down meal my boyfriend and I have ever enjoyed together. We very rarely go to the same restaurant twice, but we are certainly adding this place to our very short list of restaurants to revisit!",

    "text": "Scottsdale has a ton of fancy restaurants (which I don't mind) but we were looking for something more \"local\" and stumbled upon Basil & Garlic Bistro thanks to our handy Yelp app.  To get to this one year old restaurant, we came off E Cactus Rd, and we had to drive right into the residential neighborhoods. Once we saw the small plaza where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located, we said to each other that there was no way we would have found this place just by driving by because you just don't \"drive by\" the area where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located.  Onto the food. it was all amazing.  The chicken steak deluxe has a wonderful mixture of meat, veggies, and cheese.  There was a HUGE chunk of pepperoni in each half of the sandwich and my fiancee commented that \"this is the amount of pepperoni some places put on an entire pizza!\"  My fiancee's Vongole pasta with red sauce and clams was one of the better pasta dishes we've ever had, anywhere. And it was only $14, definitely a great deal because you're at a family owned establishment in a local neighborhood.  We finished off the meal with homemade tiramisu which was not overly sweet and did not have an overdosing of rum.  It was decorated with drizzles of chocolate sauce and cocoa powder with bits of whip cream on the side.  I come to Phoenix every so often for work and would definitely count Basil & Garlic Bistro as the place I'd try to come out to for dinner when my schedule allows me to make the drive out there.",

I went with 3 friends and we each got a slice of pizza....This was most likely the problem. The slices were nothing special, but most likely because they, like most places at lunch, reheat slices before serving. The pizza may be really good when it's fresh, but it was mediocre reheated and served for lunch. The prices were outrageously cheap though, so that was nice. I'd like to come back to try their food fresh for dinner, I think it would probably be much better.",

Our first clue that the food would be good was the aroma when we opened the door. it smelled like South Philly or  Little Italy in NY. The food was delicious. The garlic bread had a subtle garlic flavor, and nice crunch, Perfect with the garlic basil pesto shrimp and pasta. Being from the east we couldn't resist trying a calzone. The  dough was firm but not heavy and soft but not soggy. the  sauce was tasty without being too strong for the ricotta filling. Will  definitely go  back. BYOB is great for a casual place .",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place and we finally went to check it out.  The food is delicious!!   We ordered a 14\" cheese pizza that was very good, (I am from NYC and have had better). Not really a knock on Basil and Garlic.  We also had the shrimp and pasta which was excellent, lots of Garlic, yumm!  One of us had the Lasagna and I had the Chicken Parm which is very good. They were short handed that night and service was pretty slow.  The owner Nadine came over and apologized and explained the situation about finding good people to work there.  We went back again 3 weeks later and the place was packed, it took 30 minutes to get seated.  Again the food was great and the service was much better, it looked like they hired a couple of additional people to work the kitchen end of the restaurant.  Now if they could expand in that small shopping center to add more seating,  because Basil and Garlic is a real Gem of a find in a industry littered with franchise junk restaurants.  Pro's, Great Food, moderate prices, Not part of a chain, a neighborhood place. BYOB-The market south of them has an extensive Beer and Wine inventory. Outside seating area  Con's- Unassuming decor, small seating area, can get noisy when there is a large party in the room.  I have driven by this strip mall 40x over the past 2 years and never knew it was there, I am thrilled I know that B&G is tucked in there now.",

So we sat there as we see people leave.  Yet, no one is making any attempt to clear any of the several unused tables of their dirty dishes so that we can be seated.  So we just sit there and wait.  After 15 minutes of waiting, the guest at one of the nearby tables apparently had a complaint about how long it took for their pizza to be made.  The cook came out and rudely cussed at them that he's very busy because they have takeout orders in addition to their order and they just have to wait.  Anyway, after witnessing this extreme rudeness from the cook, we lost the desire to wait any longer and eat there.  We likely won't be making another attempt to eat here.",

The place seemed to have plenty of help, but had a help wanted sign in the window.  Since it probably only holds 40 people max, I'm not sure how any people were needed.  It took us 5 mins to get drinks.  And another 5 to order.  After waiting another 45 for our food, we told the waitress we were in a hurry and had to get our son to the Ice Den for hockey.  My son ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  How long does it take for spaghetti and meatballs??? So, his order comes out fast and everyone's else's except mine comes out 10 mins later.  Since we are in a hurry, I start eating my son's spaghetti while he has to leave.  I asked the waitress where's my food (a calzone) and the kitchen and waitress start a commotion and panic blaming that it went to table 6 (we were table 7).  However, I didn't see a calzone on any table.  Well, the kitchen never made my food.  I have never, ever been to a restaurant where my food was never ordered or the waitress never saw that my food was there.  Or even checking up.  We never got drink refills either.  Even after removing the drinks from the bill, it wasn't enough.",

And a lot of meat (chicken)  how nice to see the generous portion of meet to peppers to cheese - how many times do you go to an eatery and there's hardly any meat in the sandwiches. I also ordered the calamari. Came with lemon wedges and red sauce on the side. Exactly the way it's supposed to be served. The calamari was really good!  As soon as you sit down, they serve you with homemade bread and butter.  Don't fill up on it, but it's worth trying because it's really good too.

The chicken Marsala was so so, and tasted like what I might have made on a weeknight. I am just an average home cook by the way.  Not restaurant quality. Meat wasn't even pounded thin. Spaghetti sauce was also mediocre. Meatballs were decent. Chef special was pretty good. The sauteed vegetables we ordered was so salty I could only take one bite.   The tab came out to about $70 for our three dishes and one side.  We have had much better meals elsewhere for that money.",

I did not order a white pizza.  The other regular side tasted like cardboard.  We ended up throwing away 5 of the 8 slices because it was that bad.  And I was charged for a whole speciality pizza when half was just plain.  I will never go there again.  A rebuttal was posted by the store that stated I was charged for 3 toppings instead of a specialty pizza when I only had 2 toppings on half a pizza the other side was plain. I was not given a receipt either so there was no explanation of charges",

    "text": "I've had a half dozen sandwiches from Basil and Garlic as well as a couple of meals and have been satisfied with all of them.  The bread and rolls are homemade and very good.  In short, you get a real sandwich; the portions are great, if you order a chicken parm. sandwich there's plenty of chicken, it's more than enough for a full meal.  That being said they need to go onto grubhub and update their site.  All of the prices on grubhub have not been updated and are approximately two to three dollars lower than the actual price.  They show a meatball sub for $6.99 on grubhub when the actual price is $8.99.  Not a major issue but simply not good business to keep the actual pricing on websites up to date.    This is not the type of restaurant you go to for the ambience.  The decorating is marginal at best, it's your basic run of the mill setting with generic tables and chairs and harsh lighting.  The food I would describe as slightly above average but still in need of fine tuning.  It's a husband and wife setup and on any given day you can find the parents and kids having a meal before the evening starts and patrons arrive.  If your looking for a casual meal that doesn't disappoint you're in luck; if you're out to impress a date and looking for a romantic setting you've made the wrong choice.",

The pizza gets rave reviews. Crust just right - not too doughy, not too thin. Also the special of the day; sausage, tomato, white wine, lavender, peas and marinara over pasta. The bread was a little disappointing after reading rave reviews.  But the crusts on the pie and calzones were home runs.  Claudio, the owner, (Born in Palermo, raised in Bensonhurst) was hands on (literally, coming out to serve pizza at one point). This is a place that should not be missed.  That coming from a New Yorker who takes food seriously (especially pizza!). Bravo, Claudio! BYOB for a small charge.",

And, sitting outside for a table to free up wasn't an option. Which BTW, I believe sums up nicely our thoughts of Basil & Garlic. Who would wait forty minutes in the cold, for a table unless it was something special?  And special it was, owner Nadine came over and welcomed us.  She was sweet and warm, both to us and everyone in the restaurant. That was how the evening went and you can understand why so many people flock here.   We started with a salad with a home made Italian dressing for only $1.50.  For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair for $15.95 (photo) with a side of Sausage ($2.85). The cutlets were huge and very flavorful. We also ordered the Lasagna for only $13.95. It too was huge and meal for two.   I cannot convey how wonderful the evening was and how pleased we were with the food and the warmth of our host.  The food was Four Stars plus and the value over Five Stars.  Our bill came to a very fair $36.75.   Enjoy!  We look forward to our next visit.",

I have been here three times and have ordered three different dishes, all were fantastic.   The first time I was here I ordered the meatball sandwich and it was so flavorful, lightly toasted on the outside, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned, the cheese was flavorful and of great quality. I was so full after eating the first half that I saved the other half for dinner. I didn't want to ruin the delicious sandwich by reheating it in the microwave so I turned on the oven and patiently waited to once again experience the intoxicating scent of an almost fresh meatball sandwich. It was just as good as the first bite!",

The entire staff is tremendous, the food is reasonably priced, and it's BYOB, so you can save a ton by bringing your own bottle of wine. Can't think of enough superlatives about this place.

The decor is sadly neglected, drab, and cluttered. We sat at a window table overlooking a dog run owned by the groomers next door. The window shade was stuck and could not be lowered, the window glass was cracked. Half way through dinner, a large dog came to the window and barked at us then proceeded to do his business a few steps away.   A very plain Caesar salad arrived with dressing on the side. Toss it yourself? Never saw that before! The calamari was tasty but chewy. The pizza crust was delicious but covered with an overload of bland toppings. We both think there is a great potential here, but for now, we will not recommend it.",

This is nothing more than a carry-out pizza joint that decided to add a few tables, inside & out, and call themselves a 'bistro'. I went there with my Mom and Stepdad on a Friday night and the line for pizza pick-up was out the door at one point. We waited an unusually long amount of time for the waitress to acknowledge us and take our order. My Mom and I ordered the same dish, the Sauteed Shrimp and Pesto Pasta and I had the Angel Hair and she had the Linguine. The dish was 'edible', but while mine was 'creamy' in consistency, hers was really 'oily'. Tasted alright but nothing to rave about. Best part of the meal was dessert. We ordered the Cannoli, which was pretty good. Why? Because it was NOT made there..that's probably why. With SO many BETTER options for Italian in the vicinity, I say keep driving past this place and head straight to New York's Best Italian BISTRO and Cafe on 73rd/Thunderbird.",

    "text": "Am torn about giving this location only three stars but given the competition in the Scottsdale area for restaurants I think this one would only be 3 1/2 and I can't give it four.  We arrived at about 6:30 on Sunday night to find no one inside and only one table in the courtyard with patrons. It is in the inside corner of a tiny mall at Poinsettia Lane and 92nd with nothing but subdivisions all around. It seems like not many people know this place is here. They were doing a fair amount of carry out business however.  We sat inside only because they had the misters on in the courtyard and it was really getting too cold when we walked by. Inside however the ambience really lacks warmth. Perhaps they're trying to save money given the low amount of traffic they have but the lightbulbs in the 10 streetlamp looking fixtures are steely-bright fluorescent style and gave a really cold light to the room. Also although the table tops are wood the chairs and table legs are metal which adds to the cold unflattering appearance of the inside dining room. There were no table covers and the carryout register was in the middle of the room across from the door which gave it an extremely casual feel. The pictures of various cities in Italy on the wall and the streetlamp pictures themselves were cute as it appeared they were trying to make the dining room look like a courtyard in Italy. Unless you can sit outside this is not the kind of place you want to go to for a romantic dinner given their current lighting and table set up in the dining room.  We ordered fried calamari and the two specials of the day - chicken piccata and a baked creamy pasta with chicken, broccoli and bacon mixture topped with cheese.  The calamari were extremely crispy however they really lacked flavor. We squeezed lemon and added salt and it still didn't taste like enough so we added more salt and finally a third sprinkling of salt brought it close to where it needed to be. The marinara served with it was fine but nothing special.  The chicken piccata was very well-balanced with just enough garlic and lemon. Another reviewer or two mentioned that the pasta dishes were served with either too much sauce or too little pasta and I would have to agree for this dish as well. There were 2 pounded out thin pieces of chicken breast which didn't have any kind of browning from the sauteing process but the caper sauce was very good. There was a small amount of pasta on the plate and it did look funny - they either needed to serve less sauce or more pasta.  The baked pasta special with creamy chicken, broccoli and bacon was the bomb however. The top was bubbly and brown with plenty of cheese, the rigatoni were probably the wrong pasta to use as many of them dried out as they stuck out of the sauce. The chicken, broccoli, bacon and cream was very flavorful and not mixed well enough with some of the rigatoni so there were some dry pieces of rigatoni on the edges of the dish while the bottom of the dish was super creamy and flavorful.  The bread service had nicely salted butter, balsamic vinegar and olive oil options and two pieces of a dense triangle shaped bread. One of them was moist and the other one was definitely dried out and seemed like a leftover from yesterday.  Given the ambience and the couple of issues with the entrees I think the prices are just a tad bit too high. The entrees were delicious so if you want a fast, flavorful meal I would recommend it for that.",

The restaurant itself is very small, so I reserved the outdoor lighted patio for our party, We had 20 for a family style dinner. The food was fantastic, and the ambience, very private and nice.  I brought in special table linens, a portable speaker and microphone, and provided my own playlist via Spotify. Table flowers, the birthday cake, wine and beer were also brought in by me. Pricing of the food was very reasonable,  and  of course, being able to bring in my own beer and wine helped a lot in this regard. Shannon and the owner worked with me to ensure that everything  was just right.  There is no \"view\"  per se, but the ambience was perfect; private, colorful, and festive.

    "text": "I simply never leave five stars, but that doesn't mean four is best. It's just rare to get a five  Bottom line: cozy local Italian joint for local regulars. They make most of their own ingredients, it tastes good, and is reasonably priced...if you can overcome some weird interactions which may not be common  Okay, look, this place weirded me out right from the get go, but I had a positive overall food experience. So, I'm no stranger at all to local Italian joints. I went to Dominicks pizza in Glendale for 20 years till they shut down, and they knew my family by name--so I totally get the hometown family-run restaurant vibe 100%. That being said...  The moment I walk in, this kid (who really needs to shave) greets me and says \"how can I help you today\"? I responded that I don't usually get greeted with something like that when I come to a restaurant. Usually the greeter asks, 'table for 2', or 'where do you prefer to be seated'? He said that they get a lot of to go orders, that's why he asked. So then he told me I could sit anywhere, and I sat at a table.   Then came weird interaction #2. He comes up to my table and informs me that they don't have alcohol here, but if I wanted to, I could \"go to the corner, get a drink (alcoholic), and bring it back here\". I shitchu not! So I'm thinking to myself, I just sat down, and now you're offering me to leave, buy something somewhere else, and then come back here with that product? Dude, are you kidding me? Look, this guy is terrible as a greeter, otherwise he must have taken one look at me and decided to get weird for other reasons (as in I don't fit the profile of their regulars and he wants me gone--but I prefer not to take that interpretation). These two interactions alone should be enough for me not to come back. But wait, there's more  Less than a minute after that weirdness, a lady with glasses comes up to tell me about the two daily specials. The thing is, the entire time, she gave me an intent stare, without blinking. Doesn't seem weird? Be on the receiving end of it and you'll know what I'm talking about. Then she got weirdly defensive when I simply told her I didn't want the menu anymore after I ordered. She asked if I wanted to keep the menu, and I literally just said no, and she gave some strange but defensive reply  But you know what, the people and service aren't primary to me. They may be to others, but the food always comes first and foremost in my experience. If there's good food, I'm willing to endure weirdness (after all, we're all a little weird, aren't we?) in order to come get it. So keep that in mind when you read my stuff  So I ordered the lasagna, and I gotta say, it was pretty good.  The pasta was al-dente, the bolognese wasn't too sour or acidic (I'm very sensitive to that), and the ground beef tasted good. It was also hot. Believe it or not, I've gotten cold lasagna in the past, and it tastes terrible. They don't make their own ricotta, but what they put in there tasted good, and so did the mozzarella to top it off. All in all it was a good, warm, flavorful lasagna.   I will also give some UPs to the home-baked dinner rolls which were light, fluffy, tasty, and when buttered/oiled/vinegared-up, were a winning combination.  My total bill was around $20 for a coke and a lasagna with dinner rolls. Fair price  When you go to an Italian joint, there are two dishes you need to eat in order to establish if this is the kind of place you're going to return to or pass on: 1. lasagna; 2. chicken parm. This place passes test #1, so despite the weirdness, I will return some day in the future and give them another shot",

Within a few minutes, we ordered some appetizers and the kids' large pizza, which arrived so quickly - we were so thankful! I ordered the Boscaiola with linguine, which is made with Italian sausage, spinach, and mushrooms in a brandycream sauce.  I don't really like Italian sausage,  which is part of this dish, but I love creamy dishes and especially love mushrooms.  The Boscaiola was one of the most delicious pasta dishes I have ever had! It tasted like nothing I've ever had before with just a perfect amount of sweet and savory.  A definite must try!  Also got an order of their homemade Tiramisu to-go and it    was also delicious! If I'm ever in this area again, I will definitely stop in again!",

The best part, it is BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine).   We ordered the bruschetta to start, it was incredible. I then had the side salad that was cold and crisp with fresh ingredients. Their creamy Italian dressing is a must! For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and added artichoke hearts (because I couldn't decide which pasta dish to get and I LOVE artichoke hearts!). Not only was the portion size HUGE, but it was SO delicious. I was going to take half of it home but I ended up eating it all because I couldn't stop!   Believe it or not, I saved a tiny bit of room for their homemade tiramisu (the owner's wife's recipe) and holy heaven, my 'only one bite' turned into 5! Yum Yum!   For the portion sizes and quality, the prices are extremely reasonable and you can taste the love in the food. We will for sure come back again soon. I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu!",

The pasta was cooked just right but the ratio of pasta to sauce was way off.  The pasta was basically drenched in sauce, and there was frankly not enough pasta or way too much sauce.  The pizza was Ok - would not go there just for the pizza.    It's a very casual and small spot, but the prices were a bit higher than they should be for that place.   We won't be back again.",

The decor inside is questionable with some pictures from all over Italy, so inconsistent, I wasn't sure which region's Italy they were from...  I ordered pizza with pesto sauce. First bite of pizza, I couldn't believe what I just ate, pleasantly surprised. Turned around to look at the person in the kitchen, and all I could say was \"you made pesto here\" with smile.  Turned out they make most everything from scratch, they only use natural ingredients. For example, if they want to make it sweet, they use carrots. Carrots natural sweet flavor is added to their food, not sugar.  I got to talk to the chef a little, his family is originally from Sicily island and his cooking style comes from there. Wouldn't have guessed from pictures hanging on the walls.  Their tiramisu is home made, never been frozen after they made. No eggs used. They add whip cream to mascarpone, creating such a delicate texture.  While I was there, a regular customer stopped by to make a reservation and asked for today's special. It was a fish (can't remember the name anymore). I love the way southern Italian fish is cooked. I thought if I could come back for dinner that night.  This is not a fancy place at all but this place sure will satisfy foodies' palete.  Can't wait to coma back to try more food.",

    "text": "I first learned about this gem of a restaurant a month or three ago. I stumbled upon it whilst googling \"stromboli\" as I had a craving for said dish. Google Maps gave me two locations near my work at Shea and the 101...the B&G reviews were many and the ratings high, I started flipping thru the pictures and was delighted by the sights they showed me. The reviews stated portions were generous and the quality was high.  Over the next few weeks I referred co-worker after co-worker to the location and all of them came back happy and satisfied with their Calzones, Stromboli, and a Sandwich.  Last week I finally stopped cyber-stalking the B&G and took the plunge and called in an order for lunch for 5.  The gal that took my order was friendly, polite, and a pleasure to speak with.  All of my food was ready when I went to pick it up and I explained the silliness of my web based salivation I'd been afflicted with to the 3 people working there and we all had a laugh about it.  The food was excellent.  I ate 1/2 my Stromboli and brought the rest home and my wife agreed it was delicious. All of my coworkers enjoyed their meals as well, one of them suggests a wrap for the Chicken Parmesan sandwich to make it less FILLING.  All in all I can't wait to go back for more.  Thank you Basil and Garlic!",

Everything is made fresh and on property with the exception of very few items. For example; mozzarella sticks, French fries, etc.   Our food was incredible!! The Alfredo sauce was especially addicting... I ordered the Lasagna (which was amazing) but I finished with the Alfredo because I couldn't stay away!!",

I can't believe it's been over a year (9/21/14!) since our first visit to this casual little strip mall restaurant. I was ready to give the five stars then, but most certainly now, after our additional visits.   Pizza, calzones, sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes and do you want fries with that? Weird! But perfect because our first visit here had my husband craving fries and me wanting pizza. He and I were also growly (not just stomachs) but mentally over a pool pump debacle. Food cures everything!? Well, delicious food and good company goes  goes a long way toward making a annoying circumstance a lot brighter and fondly memorable.  The owners are a delight. Nadine introduced herself and Claudio came over to say hello on our first visit. We got to talking about Europe, how those two met and so on.... It's always a treat to meet the owners and to hear the stories that make a place \"the\" place. Claudio also told us of his Sicilian heritage and how \"Basil and Garlic's\" logo embodies it. Cool!   We have eaten heartily of: fresh bread, regular pizza, speciality pizza (El Diavlo), calzone, salad, and those fries. It's BYOB. The outdoor patio is set-up for those days when it's not 110. What this resto lacks in \"ambiance\" (i.e. your date may find it on the \"simple\" side), it makes up for via heart and flavor. Generous portions, too. Don't wait for a pool pump debacle, B&G is worth a visit all on its own.",

We had a very friendly and attentive waitress take care of us.  When I asked for a wine menu, she informed me that I can buy a bottle at the liquor store next door and that she will charge a cork fee of 4.50!  This is WAY better than actually ordering a glass of wine...I bought a bottle of chianti for 11.00, so ended up with an entire bottle of wine for 15.50!  We took over half home.    For the food, my wife and I first shared the fried mushroom appetizer -- delicious and huge portion, with a huge portion of marinara sauce as well.  We then shared a large pizza with a bunch of veggies.   The restaurant was EXTREMELY generous with the vegetables; we made a couple of substitutis at no charge, and the veggies were literally piled on like I have never seen,  We will definitely be back at some point...",

This place needs more  waiters & they need to remember the customers come first...Very Very disappointing... They should either take pizza off the menu or get a separate oven just for the pizza which slows all the orders down..Very bad logistics @ the customers expense. Most restaurants would have deducted an entree for the long wait or apologized, they did neither. It was not a very good experience.  This place is Hit or Miss. They are not consistent in their food.

I wasn't expecting much more than the average pizza from their predecessors but they blew away my expectations. We have eaten here 4 times in the last month and have loved it every time. The pizzas are great, our favorite is the diavola. They are huge with lots of toppings. The menu says 16 inches but I measured it once and it was well over 17\". The crust is soft but chewy and one the best I've found in AZ.  The couple that runs the place are very friendly and the kind of people that make you want to go back. They have a small seating area so you can dine in or take it home. Either way the service is fantastic. Highly recommended if you are looking for something that is not a crappy chain (dominos, papa johns, etc).",

    "text": "My daughter raves about this place and I thought it would be a great Friday to try it since I didn't want to cook.  I'm so glad I got lazy. We had to wait a bit for seating since all the tables were filled.   The restaurant is a small quaint place with about 9 or 10 tables (I recall 8 tables which seat 4 and 1 or 2 that seat 2).  We ordered our meal family style so we could try several dishes.  We started out with the Calamari. It was a nice plateful that was easily shared with our party of 6. The calamari was fried to perfection with a very light batter and a side of marinara sauce. It was served with fresh baked homemade bread which gave us a way to 'sop' up any extra marinara sauce.  Our entrees came shortly after. We ordered Vongole on spaghetti (they ran out of linguini) in white sauce, Quattro Formaggi penne, Rucola e Gamberetti on sedani, and the Quattro Formaggi pizza with pepperoni on 1/2 of it.  All I can say is WOW! WOW! WOW! I'd be a fat cow if I lived by this place... Each dish was so flavorful and portioned for this family of 5 adults and a kid. You could tell there was no shortcutting on any of the ingredients that were placed into each dish. You can taste the love, pride, and warm hearted delight that the owners want to share with each and every bite. We topped off our evening with homemade spumoni, cannoli, and tiramisu... Well worth ALL the calories - no regrets!  My daughter and her boyfriend are regulars to this restaurant since moving just under 2 miles away. Claudio and Nadine recognize them and made sure they came by the table after dinner was done.  Claudio did visit each customer table through the time we were there too. The husband and wife duo were so friendly and down to earth.  I love that they like to make their customers feel valued and appreciated for visiting them. I can easily see how my daughter fell in love with this bistro and the people that run it.   All in all, the rainy day excuse (aka lazy) was the BEST reason NOT to cook last night.   HIGHLY recommended and I WILL be sharing this little diamond in the desert.",

    "text": "This little Italian bistro is an unassuming, tucked away gem. We went there after looking at the other reviews on yelp, and were not disappointed. My coworkers and I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, a calzone, the cheesy fries, and tiramisu.  First of all, the portions are VERY generous. The calzone, for the average person, would be enough for 3 meals. I was with a 20-something man who never has an issue clearing his plate. Well, this time he did.   The fries were covered in what was the tastiest, garlic-infused mozzarella. It is also a big helping. The vegetarian sandwich came on beautiful bread and was overflowing with marinated and cooked veggies, topped off with that delightful mozzarella again.   Then there is the calzone. We ordered a vegetarian calzone (made to our specifications). I already mentioned the size (epic!), but the flavors involved are a beautiful combination. Many times, a calzone is pretty straightforward. Cheese, sauce, other fillings, etc. This was such an intricate pallet of flavors, it's clear a lot of thought, and skill, went into its creation.  Last, but certainly not least, was the tiramisu. It's a big piece, creamy, great flavors-none of which overwhelm the others.   Seriously, this place is great. The owners, Claudio and Nadine, are charming and welcoming (Claudio is the Sicilian chef, and talks to customers while bustling around in the kitchen). Make sure to not be in a big hurry, because this quality (and quantity) of food can't be rushed. The prices are very reasonable, and it was an overall delightful experience. We plan on going back very soon!",

As we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we had some of their fresh made bread which was really good. Our group ordered everything from pizza to calzones to pasta to one of their hot subs made with their fresh bread. All of the food was delicious and the portions are generous for the price.

I'll be working off those fat grams for weeks, but it was an amazing gourmet comfort melting in my mouth.  My date got penne with Bolognese and it was relish.  In fact, it would be good to split them and mingle the flavors.  You can just walk to the store a few steps down to purchase a bottle of wine as they don't serve, but will open and pour for you.  Oh, and both of us had a small garden salad with their house balsamic dressing.  Loved all the little piles of condiments on the sal",

    "text": "This is a small restaurant with big flavors and highly recommended to everyone looking for classic pizza, calzones, stromboli's, sub's or Italian favorites from an east coast style pizzaria. The owners are extremely engaging, husband is from Palermo, Sicily, Italy (probably the capital when it comes to Italian pizza makers in America and his beautiful wife is from Germany---should be interesting this summer for the World Cup). They check a few times with customers to ensure quality and complete satisfaction while dining. Once you try their food you'll probably quickly become a regular, as I recently did.  They offer house made bread that is unique, served for meals and used for the sandwiches offered. The pizza dough is expertly prepared and cooked to a nice crispness, the pizza sauce is not sweet like you find at many other local pizza establishments and the mozzarella cheese is the highest quality that melts perfectly on your pizza and sandwiches.  The Bistro is a little hard to find but located in a small strip shopping center off 92nd street between Shea and Cactus (formerly 2 Men and a Pizza). If you don't live nearby, it's well worth the trip from anywhere in the Scottsdale area if you're looking for the pizzaria you remember from anywhere east of the Mississippi.   I have not tried the entrees yet but they do offer quite a few on the menu and have seen numerous satisfied customers. I hope you get by to meet the new owners soon. Please remember, this is a BYOB establishment that does not serve alcohol.  Enjoy, DeLaurentis",

The restaurant is very small with spartan decor, but this family owned bistro serves up delicious entrees from scratch and everything we ate was wonderful!  Chicken cacciatore, ciopino, eggplant parmesan, and spaghetti bolognese were among the entrees we ordered and each was freshly prepared and so very flavorful!  The bruschetta, as an appetizer, was also plentiful and yummy!  I hope that someone from Diners, Drive- ins and Dives or, locally, Check Please Arizona, comes over to this relatively new restaurant to see for themselves how good it is there!",

A very nice, and very helpful 20 year old girl born in Italy. It helps keep it authentic. I had spaghetti and meatballs and a delicious cannoli.",

We got there and were escorted to a 4 top with an extra chair.  Squishy.  There was a table for 6 that was reserved and no one was there so I asked if we could move there.\"No, it's reserved\" was the answer.  So we all squished around this 4 top.  So I thought the party of 6 would show up soon but when we left at 6:35-40 the table was still empty.  The food was/is amazing, the waitress seemed on the coolish side.  It seems to me they could have moved us over as the party of 6 was obviously not showing until much later than us.  Our space to eat was very limited.  Moral of the story....if you have a group of 5, ask for a table bigger than a 4 top.",

The regular cheese pie - too much cheese, no sauce and the pie was undercooked. The Sicilian pie - very little cheese, sauce couldn't be found and the dough and crust was undercooked as well. The chicken parm sandwich might have been the worst of the three - so soggy and tasteless. Got home, opened up the boxes and knew right away it was not going to be good. It's a shame because it's a small local place. Reading the reviews and earring the food - not sure I can really trust the reviewers here on yelp anymore. I mean seriously, the pizza is bad.",

They also have amazing vegetarian options. The vegetarian pizza could literally feed me for days and has awesome grilled veggies on top. I also love getting the alla vodka pasta but with broccoli, bell peppers, and spinach (instead of ham). The veggie sandwich is also amazing and probably the best deal of the bunch. Their hot sandwiches and pizza are super reasonably priced. Their pasta is definitely on the edge of being too pricey for the portion but I still buy it because it's tasty. They are also take-out friendly so you can call them ahead with your order. Also, if you dine in, BYOB. I love the 19 Crimes red blend (can be found at Trader Joe's and some other grocery stores) with my pasta alla vodka. This spot is definitely worth checking out!",

I highly recommend the calzones--filled with amazing ingredients of your choice and HUGE. I've sampled many of my coworkers dishes including the veggie sandwich, which is loaded with an array of exquisitely roasted vegetables, and loved them all.

To start, the place is lit with fluorescent tube lights and is brighter than most convenience stores. Hardly the kind of lighting anyone wants to eat dinner in. To continue on about decor would be long winded so I'll say this, if yelp gave a decor rating it would be -1 star.   My girlfriend and I enjoy eating out and this was not even close to what we expected. The antipasto salad was generic with under roasted peppers and deli sliced meats that were worthy of a grade school sandwich on white bread. The pizza, \"the chefs special\", was greasy and undercooked. Nothing fresh or authentic about this place.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, our second visit, after a great weeknight dinner experience at the restaurant,  was on a Friday at 6:30PM reservations.  We arrived to a full restaurant and our reservations had not been recorded.  They did have a table for us and were seated at 6:40PM.  My wife and I ordered the same menu item as our first visit (spaghetti, meat sauce, made with angel hair pasta.  Our dinners were served at 7:50PM.  The spaghetti and its sauce were  barely warm and poorly drained such that the sauce was watery.  Such a difference from our first visit!!!!.  I suspect the restaurant had far too many orders for take-outs plus the full restaurant to a quality job of anything!    Don't go on a Friday!",

We usually get a stromboli instead of a pizza when we're ordering to go - always good! When we eat in, we often get one of the specials. Had the scallops in white wine pesto cream sauce tonight -it was great! Good, team oriented service in a family owned and operated restaurant. They never disappoint.",

    "text": "This place is kinda far from me, but I stopped in to check the place out since it changed from Two Guys Pizza or whatever it was. I went in after lunch, and it wasn't super busy - but they still had a steady stream of customers coming in. Neighborhood locals who were apparently already all hooked on their food.   The owners were an adorable young couple - both originating from other Countries before moving here. They were fun and charming. We had a nice chat before I got fed. I like them and hope they do well... going by the other reviews here, I have no doubt they will - even in the unassuming little corner location.  So I ordered a Cheesesteak because my diet lately has been pizza and cheesesteaks and I need to cool it and start eating more salads and going to the gym, but a cheesesteak sounded good and that's what I wanted, so shut up!   Anyway, the sandwich was unlike any cheesesteak I had seen... they make their own bread for the sandwich, and it seems to be based on the pizza crust dough. It was one of the most unique cheesesteak sandwiches I've had and easily in my top 5 in Phoenix. The meat was tender and flavorful - perfectly seasoned.   Now, I know that most cheesesteaks in the Valley are made of the same meat - most restaurants get their sliced ribeye meat from the same vendor. The reason some places taste better or worse is due to a number of factors - how they store the meat, how they season it (if they even season it at all), and how they prepare it. That being said - this is definitely a place not to be missed.  I asked another patron to see their pizza they were picking up as she was leaving and it looked and smelled amazing. If I wasn't so full and if it wouldn't have been ridiculous, I might have ordered one of those to go so I could eat it for dinner or breakfast or whatever. I'm glad I didn't because I was full until I went to bed. I didn't feel bloated or anything - just full as in not hungry.   I also saw a calzone being prepared - gigantic/epic.   This is a top quality restaurant. I'd drive out of my way to come back here... probably will.",

I also had to have a slice of pizza so I chose the 'garlic & basil' and it was tasty. And since I read the reviews about Garlic and Basil before I went I read about the Tiramisu and being Italian myself and grandma used to make this, i had to try it - it was just simply Wonderful. I went back 2 nights later and tried a pasta dish, Garlic and Basil in a pesto and tomatoes base sauce, and shrimp over angel hair pasta (you can choose your pasta type). Personally I would have liked more shrimp, but I LOVE shrimp. A definite win win. Great food, the staff is friendly. Oh one point of inconvenience, the young gal at the register did not bag up my order and I had to try and balance everything to leave (4 separate containers), finally another woman noticed my struggle and asked if I would like a bag - ah yes! This should not be a question, this should be done automatically - common sense!",

Family was feeling Italian, I was feeling my patience drain.  The food at Basil and Garlic was personally responsible for the fate of all of Scottsdale.  If I didn't fill my gullet with good food, I was going to lose my s@#t.  This establishment laughed in the face of danger and packed our table with wonderful Italian food with amazing flavor.  We covered all our bases by ordering a few different pasta dishes and a sandwich.  I wont go into the idle details of who had what, cause I ate them all.  I normally bat clean up for our team, but this time they all tapped out early cause of the big portions, so I had an (happy) cavalcade of Italian delights.  I would like to say the sauces were to die for, but it was more than that.  The sauces were to kill for.  Yep, you heard it here first.  I could choke someone for a plate of their sauce.  So good, will be back.  Thank you.",

She told us about coming over from Europe and opening the restaurant and sat down and talked with us about our family.  When we came back a month later, she remembered us - which is crazy for how many people come through that restaurant in a month's time. Even though the fried eggplant wasn't on the menu the second time we came in, she was more than happy to make it for us again.  We have been back a couple times since - every time has been enjoyable and delicious. The servings are large and authentic. The dessert pizzas are to die for too!",

It's just in a parking lot in a hole-in-the-wall tiny strip mall in the middle of a neighborhood. But sometimes those are the best places. The inside of the restaurant is nothing to write home about and could use some serious updating, but hey, it is what it is! The food is great and we will definitely come here again. Looking forward to trying more things on their menu - as everything we saw that came out of the kitchen looked so good!  The service and staff were friendly and attentive too.

It wasn't busy at all and there were only two other tables filled. There was one waiter, and one cook. Our waiter wrote all of our orders down. I ordered the Quarto Formaggi and added chicken. When he brought it out, it was missing chicken. We mentioned that we wanted chicken, and he even told me that it was extra when he took my order. So they had to redo the entree. This pasta was extremely cheesy and super heavy. My friend ordered the four cheese pizza, large, because she's a vegetarian, and he brought out a completely different pizza that was completely wrong and had meat on it. Apparently the pizza was pretty bland and the last cheese they put on was just Parmesan that they sprinkled on. My other friend ordered the cheesesteak deluxe I believe with extra mayo. He forgot the mayo and it looked like it was very minimal cheese. I'm just not sure how he got most of the orders wrong if he wrote everything down. To top it off, the waiter spilled water all over my friend when he accidentally knocked the cup over when filling the water.   They're only getting a 2 star because I would've given them a 1 star, because the waiter ended up paying for my friend's order when he spilled water on her, and we also were offered a free dessert. However, you do get a free dessert if you check in with the purchase of two entrees.",

They have an outdoor patio, as well as tables inside. I originally was thinking I would take it to go but decided to stay and am glad I did. The waitress was so nice. I ordered the chicken parm sub (only one size) which was huge and I couldn't finish it. The sub was one of the best I've had. The bread was crusty and soft in the middle, not overly sauced, used real cheese, and the chicken was not dry. I saw other folks order traditional italian dishes rather than subs and they all looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I came here because my Ingress friends.  One of them was too busy catching a super rare Pokemon.  The other one suggested that I try Basil and Garlic. Basil and Garlic is a small restaurant located in a strip shopping center in Scottsdale.  The were not too busy when we arrived and were seated immediately.    We ordered their vongole with a white sauce and a bolognese with a penne pasta.  Complimentary bread was given to us.  The vongole was the best dish of the night.  The flavor was good and had a decent amount of clams in it.  The daughter and I have had better bolognese.  We both thought that their bolognese was a too acidic (sour).  I finished it, while my daughter finished all their bread.  We didn't really want to ask for more bread since our dinner was already finished.  Luckily we had vitasoy and red bean dessert in the car.    Service was good.  They kept us filled with bread and kept our cups filled with water.  It was an okay visit.  There is better food, according to the other Yelp reviews...if we had only took the time to read them.  But, with one visit, 3 star is what I can give them.",

I want a bite at the Basil and Gar--lic..... Bistro  Pretty solid traditional Italian eatery!  I came with my family on a quiet night.  We started out with breadsticks, onion rings, and some calamari.  Pretty much your typical appetizers, but what really popped for me was the marinara sauce that came with it.  It was thick, sweet, and had a strong tomato base.  We all shared the Basil & Garlic Pizza with sausage.  The crust was warm and doughy while topped with  mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and pesto sauce.  I'm not a fan of pesto sauce on my pizza, but overall it was a subtle bite and very cheesy for sure.    Since this is an Italian restaurant; I ordered an entree too!  I went for the Bolognese with linguine pasta.  I love the meaty sauce coming out piping hot as I can see the steam.  The sauce was sweet and robust.  I wish the pasta was handmade, but I understand not everyone has time for it.    In the end, service was solid and on point.  The place is tiny and has a cute homey allure to it.  The place is kind of off the map from what I can gather, but if you need a quite home cooked bite; this is your spot! - Enjoy!",

First off the food alone gets a 5 star rating but there's more to it than just the food. I've both eaten in and taken out a handful of times. My last two take outs took over an hour and just under an hour. Both times I was estimated with a 20-25 minute times. Tonight I showed up 30 minutes after and all the employees were asking each other about my order. My gut tells me they forgot about it. They then tell me it'll be ready in 6 minutes. 15 minutes later they say it'll be ready in 1 minute. About 3 minutes later it was finally ready. It was exactly twice as long as they told me it would be.  Add to this, they didn't even get my order right and I didn't notice until I got home. I ordered a calzone with sausage added but they forgot the sausage.   Again, the food here alone is excellent. It has a cool neighborhood feel and is BYOB if you eat in but they need to to get it together on the operational side.",

My wife usually gets the Vongole and I get the Chef special but we have also tried other dishes on the menu including the pizza and have loved it all.   The owners and staff are very friendly.

Everything said in other reviews about the wonderful owners is True. They are very nice and friendly.  However, the people raving about the food must be crazy. The flavors are very Americanized! And the pasta is not fresh but from a box. I ordered the Bolognese, the sauce had a nice taste but did not have the spice of a True Italian Bolognese and had way too many tomatoes. Moreover, the centers of the meat chunks were cold...a dead giveaway for a reheated sauce... The chefs special pasta has cheap deli lunch meat ham, making a decent tasting sauce very cheap.   I plan to try the pizza before making a final judgement, but at this point I am less than impressed.",

I am from NY and so are the owners of Basil and Garlic Bistro. There was an immediate connection. To say the food was \"just like home\" is an understatement. Fugettabouit.   Now don't go in expecting anything fancy. This is a tiny little joint pizzeria style. Just a few tables with extremely minimal decor. In my opinion, that is part of the charm. No airs about so the food needs to stand on its own. I had the linguine and clams and it is just like I used to get in queens. Just right. My mother had the chicken parm dinner, which is not actually on the menu but they advised me that most heros (sandwiches for people who don't speak NY) can be made into dinners. To say it was excellent is also an understatement. Dad had the meatball hero which was perfection and we took pizzas home which are exactly what we are used and long for. All heros are served on their delicious bread which is also given to the table when you first sit. Amazing.  For dessert we ordered the cannolis as you can't fully judge a place without having their cannolis. Did I say OMG? Oh yeah, I did.   I can't wait to come back to Basil and Garlic Bistro. I will be dreaming about it until then.",

We passed on the starters and went right to the pasta which has to be some of the best in the entire valley. The flavors and portions were ample and overall a great value. They don't serve liquor so BYOB and the corkage fee is only $4.50.",

I got my own personal pie of pepperoni and black olives and then we also got homeade bread made from scratch before the meal.   Everything tasted wonderful and the atmosphere was so laid back. I will definitely come back!",

That is to say that there were limited offerings. For one thing, we were not able to get a sandwich. Our only choices were dinner or a salad. One of the main disapointments was the pricing. The restarunt does not warrant such high pricing. We go to Magiano's and get get surroundings and the pricing is a lot less. The food was good, but the pricing need to come down quite a bit for us to even consider going back. I felt bad recommending we go there for dinner. Usually price is not a problem, but we do like a nice atmosphere if we are paying so much. Not even table cloths.",

We got takeout, thank God, because the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a 7-11.  No offense to the owners, but the dining area floor plan is a mess, complete with garbage bag table cloths and a massive Pepsi machine in the middle of the room.    I ordered Chef Claudio's Favorite.  The sauce and pasta weren't bad but the ham was basically cold cuts you would get from  Safeway...not what you would expect from a 5 star Yelp restaurant for close to $20.  My wife ordered the Quattro Formaggi, very much overkill on the cheese and had a very chunky consistency and gritty texture.    Again, I hate to bash a place but this is a 2 star restaurant and these 5 star reviews are absolute nonsens",

We had a party of 9 and one couple received their food 10 minutes after the rest of us. The waitress lost the order for one person in our party so she just ate off other people's plates. The waitress apologized and brought out a free dessert, but the slow, sporadic service was just too frustrating.  We wouldn't go here again, simply because of the slow service.  The food we tried (which was excellent) included pizza, calzones, salad, pasta, the meatball sub, and the nutella pizza dessert. Very tasty.",

As I approached the opened door early one morning to see what was going on, I was overcome by a wonderful aroma of sauce cooking on the stove.  I picked up a menu and told the owner I would return.  I placed an order a couple of days later and I have to say the food was just great.  The pizza was probably the best I had since leaving NY many years ago.  It certainly was better than anything I have tasted in Scottsdale.  The taste was unbelievable.  The salads were large, fresh and were big enough to share.  There were several people eating at the tables and the pasta dishes looked delicious.  I was sorry I only ordered a pizza and salad.  That ok since I know I will be back there in a couple of days with my family.  The prices are very reasonalbe and I want to try everything on the menu.  Best of luck to the new owners and I will see you soon.",

I am very picky about chicken marsala and this was excellent with an abundance of mushrooms and delicious sauce.  The portions are extremely generous for the pricing.  Tiramisu was delish -- Nadine makes it, as was the cannoli - crunchy with delicious filling.  No complaints from us -- and we will be back.  We have finally found an Italian restaurant near our house that has the quality of food we enjoy.  I also like that you can bring your own wine for a $4.50 corkage fee -- that is a deal.

Very good service, the owners are very kind and thoughtful.  The bread served with your salad is fresh baked and ohhhhh sooooo good!!  The sausage parm with added onions and peppers were very good!  The chefs special is light, fresh and also very good.  I would have added more mushrooms, peppers and onions with the dish.  Lat lunch is the best time to go.

If you go I strongly urge you to get the Boscaiola. I've tried pretty much everything on menu but I keep coming back to the Boscaiola. The dining atmosphere is 'intimate' and very casual.

Food was great the second night as well, service BAD, waited way to long for our check...then had to locate someone to get our change back.... Gave them a 100 bill for a 64.00 tab..... Don't assume your tip!! That's still our choice, tipped our regular 20%.... But, again never assume your cut!!",

It was perfection with sweet and attentive service.   The food was TO DIE FOR! Super fresh and served hot, which is a must when eating Italian food. I asked for extra garlic on virtually everything and they obliged en force.  And no Yelp, they did not have 'Gender Neutral Restrooms' you freaks.",

    "text": "Decided to make this our next choice for dinner after reading some reviews on Yelp. It's tucked away in a small corner just off of Cactus road. So I would have never found this place without Yelp.   We went for an early dinner and was surprised to see we were the only people in the restaurant. There were only about 10 tables so the place was tiny. The decor was nothing fancy but when I go out to eat it isn't about the paintings on the wall. It's all about the food and boy the food surpassed my expectations. Everything on the menu sounded tempting and I decided on the sausage sub. It was a crispy sandwich filled with Italian sausage, onions, and peppers that just came off the grill. The staff offered me some marinara sauce and parmesan cheese to go with it. Fantastic! It was one of several other sub choices. I'll be back to try some of the others. My girlfriend ordered a pizza and it was tasty. The dough was made fresh and you can taste the difference.   Another astonishing shock was the price! I can believe she got a 12 inch pizza for only 8 bucks. I thought it would be twice the price for something so fresh and authentic. Puts Papa Johns to shame. My sub was more than filling and I'm a starving 23 year old. I didn't even finish it. Here I was concerned there were no side choices. Probably the cheapest meal we've ever paid for and I appreciate that! The staff were extremely friendly and pleasant. Took time to start a conversation with us. This is now a personal favorite of mine as I love Italian food. Too bad I live in Mesa, but worth the drive! Especially to come back and try the desserts I've only seen pictures of.",

    "text": "Pretty solid hole in the wall Italian place. As someone who does not eat Italian as much, I could not make a judgement regarding authenticity, however the place seemed inviting and the interior had a comfy feel to it. The food was served in satisfying portions, and quite tasty. I ordered the alla vodka which came with a basket of bread. As far as the bread goes, it was nothing fancy, however I was told that the bread was home made. I'm not sure how fresh the bread was, but it was mildly warm when served. It felt almost as if it was microwaved. The wait time for the food was not long, granted I went during after lunch hours and the food was presented nicely. My one complaint was that the pasta was very saucy which made it a bit soggy, however it was not too much an issue for me. As far as prices go, the pasta prices for more premium dishes were competitive with those at more well established Italian restaurants which, considering the causality of the place, felt a tad bit pricey for me. Overall, there was nothing outstandingly bad about the place or the food and the pros outweighed the cons. With friendly staff, a family run environment, prompt service and tasty food, it was an overall positive experience.",

I was extremely underwhelmed for it being a \"special\".  The shrimp was overcooked, the asparagus very soggy, the pasta stuck together in clumps, and a watery sauce.  My mother had a salad and another family member had chicken.  Cannot understand why it took so long when the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  I was expecting at least a little more based on all the reviews.  One word - \"meh\"",

This is the kind of place you look for when traveling, an unassuming, down-home, authentic hole in the wall that only the natives know about.  I took my Mom here last week to celebrate what would have been Dad's 94th birthday. Kinda a sad-happy day, but aside from the great food we found Claudio the owner-chef who is from Sicily and of course speaks Italian...this thrilled Mom having someone to speak Italian with. I also enjoyed listening...it was great and took our minds off the day.  Forget the decoration/decor...un-important...you are here to eat real Italian food.  We both had eggplant parmigiana, Mom had the ciabatta sandwich and I had the plate with rigatoni. The ciabatta was huge, seriously big enough for 2 people to share and was only like 7 bucks.  The dinner plate was also huge, I only at half there, at some for dinner at home and the rest for breakfast the next day. Yes, folks...that's one of my tests for good food, if it tastes too the next morning for breakfast...it gets a star.  Why was it taking so long to cook? Well I gotta think Claudio cooks to order, because this was the absolute BEST eggplant parm. I've had (except for mine :-). The eggplant was sliced thin and lightly breaded, the sauce was to die for, and the cheese was excellent. The rigatoni was excellent as well.  Plenty of parking No liquor license but 30' away is a deli you can buy beer or wine and you can byob. Out-Door Seating Credit Cards  Definitely going back and has replace my other neighborhood Italian restaurant. I will be working my way down their menu for sure!",

    "text": "You might not like Basic & Garlic Bistro.  It is about as far removed from fine dining as you can get without being fast food.  The restaurant is small and simply decorated, but it is clean and it has tables with tableclothes and comfortable chairs.  The couple who own and run it are young and probably make mistakes from time to time.  But they are enthusiastic, they try hard, and the food is REALLY GOOD.  You can get pizza by the slice for $1.85 plus 35 cents (that's no typo) for each topping.  Get one topping - they put on plenty.  These slices are 1/8 of a 16-inch pie, so two will fill me up but I could eat three or four if I had to.  That makes for a pretty cheap dinner.  That's the best buy on the menu -- other choices are moderately priced but not ridiculously inexpensive.  The pizza is very thin crust, fairly crisp, and covered in a standard mozzarella cheese.  The pepperoni topping was the usual, the sausage appeared to be homemade and was mild but delicious, and the meatball was just about as good as it gets.  It all worked together to make a fine old-time pizza.  My wife had a sub which came on freshly baked and crusty bread that had her insisting that I try a piece because it was SO good.  When she got full, she ate the sandwich filling, which she said was even better than the bread.  This is a neighborhood affordable Italian eatery.  Cut them some slack.  For what they try to be, they are as good as it gets, and that is plenty good enough to have me coming back.",

    "text": "We tried out this place because of the positive Yelp ratings.  And who doesn't want to try out a new italian place?  It was packed on Saturday night and for the life of me I didn't think this was the kind of place that required reservations.  Someone had told me it was a little, family owned hole-in-the-wall that served good italian food.  So we had to wait for a table for about 15 minutes--not too bad.  It took a while to order because the place was really packed but we were quite patient.  Ordered chicken parm with angel hair plus one combination chicken & eggplant with rigatoni.  The server told us it would be a while so we were ready for a wait.  We were provided a basket with two small rolls and butter.  They were really, really crispy & delicious.  ( I overheard someone at another table saying that they make their own bread.)  We added olive oil to our dishes and dunked the rolls for a yummy experience.  We were hoping they would bring more since a previous reviewer said that they keep the bread and water coming but such was not the case.  We were too polite to ask for more and perhaps that was a mistake.   While waiting we noticed that people bring their own wines and get charged a small corkage fee.  Good idea.  Maybe next time.  We chit chatted and chit chatted anxiously awaiting our food.  Plates came and went but not our dishes.  When the waitress said it would take a while, she wasn't kidding.  Alas, after one hour, (yes, one hour) our food arrived looking mighty beautiful.  (too bad I didn't take a photo).  A mound of chicken with sauce and cheese alongside some beautiful looking pasta.  Tasted the pasta first to try the sauce and it was great---not too sweet and not too vinegary--a nice fresh taste especially with the freshly chopped parsley on it.  The chicken was thicker than most as it was not really a cutlet, but it was perfectly cooked with a crunchy outer crust.  I was happy.  Hubby was enjoying his as well and after such a long wait I was really relieved that he was loving his food.  However, there is one issue that I have to bring up despite the loveliness of the food.  Keep in mind that this is a small place with an open kitchen.  Diners are literally a few feet away from the kitchen operation.  The clanging of the clean dishes being stacked,  the dropping of large utensils and the throwing of pots when cooks are not happy with each other is NOT a good thing.  They have to figure out how to disagree in the kitchen without throwing pots and without certain words being used.  We are very upbeat and flexible people, but it got to the point where we couldn't really enjoy the meal because of the excessive kitchen noise.  I'm not talking about diners having a good time who get louder and louder the more wine they drink.  No, no.  People enjoying their food and wine is to be expected.  But what should be contained is the kitchen noise.  There has to be a way of placing dishes whereby you don't feel that every dish in the place has crashed to the floor.   Figure it out guys.  Have your differences after the customers leave 'cause we really loved your food and want to come back.   Looking forward to our next meal with you with just a little less noise.   Thanks.",

And B&G Bistro's food is exactly that.  The wonderful smells greet you at the door. Add to that a very hard working, charming young couple, Claudio and Nadine, who are at the helm, and frankly, what's not to like?  Simply put...at the time of this writing, this place has barely been on the map more than 3 months.  It already has the whole neighborhood talking and supporting it.  I saw person after person come in, pick up their food, and tell the owners that they heard about them from somebody. They don't need to advertise but I shall Yelp regardless. I can already see longevity and expansion in their future.  Antipasto salad. Decorated with attractive rolls of excellent tasting meats and cheese. Add more shredded cheese and very crisp romaine. Top it with still warm, freshly grilled red bell pepper in olive oil. Then top it with his house balsamic dressing. Get it!  Then make sure you sop up the dressing with slices of his own freshly baked bread. And try not to roll your eyes into the back of your head while you moan in delight.  Chicken Marsala. Tender, generous, moist chicken breast, pounded then seared to perfection, then topped with copious amounts of sauteed mushrooms in a Marsala sauce. You get to name your pasta, Mr. B chose Angel hair.  An excellent choice.  Cheese Steak Deluxe. A sandwich that is destined for fame. Start with thinly sliced, tender beef and a touch of pepperoni, add well sauteed mushrooms, onions, some of those magnificent grilled red bell pepper slices, and some great melty cheese, then drop it and all its juices into one of his freshly baked Italian rolls.  Juicy, flavorful, huge. Wouldn't change a thing.  There is no pretense to his food. He cooks with simplicity. He cooks it fresh. He loves his customers and already knows them by name. There is a very special vibe here.  Plenty of left overs to revisit tonight's meal. And we will be back.  Maybe to try a pizza from his stone oven.  All I can say is, if you dropped everything and ran over here now, it will not be a moment too soon, and you will be happy you did.",

Our waitress acted like we were putting her out--she  brought the check before we finished eating.. she seemed annoyed at our mere presence...one dish was cool in the center as if it was simply heated over by tossing some sauce on top. I had been here before and it was good--will give it another chance.  This nite seemed to simply overwhelm them completely. One flaw that will never change is the ambiance--noise level and 'outdoor dining' is actually in a parking lot.",

    "text": "Wanted to try something new, so hit up Yelp with a \"nearby\" and stumbled on to this little gem. In an area where it seems like Italian and pizza places are overflowing, we found what could possibly be the perfect spot. (It could be perfect, but I hate to call it that after one visit)  First the boring stuff - it's just south of Cactus on 94/92nd St (right where they change over) in a small strip mall with what looks like a convenience store, hair salon, and Vapor store). It looks smaller on the outside than it actually is - and I saw seating outside, that I assume they can use for busier  (non rainy) days. It was clean and bright. The tables had table cloths on themn which I appreciate for some unknown crazy reason.  I ordered the Quattro Formagio pasta and my husband gotta the Meatball Parmesian sub. He was quite pleased with his! Mine gave me a choice of pasta type (which I love because everyone has a favorite type, I love the thin Angel Hair). The 4 cheese included gorgonozla, which was an unexpected surprise (well unexpected until I saw it in writing on the menu). And, let me tell you that it worked. It. Was. Wonderful! The single best Quattro Formagio that I have ever had. The hubs used to go to Sicily every year for Reserve duty and he said it definitely rivaled that which he's had there. They served bread, of course. Not sure what it was, but it kind of reminded me of sour dough and or was good. Saved mine for my pasta, and it was the perfect accompaniment.   Serving size was perfect for dinner (we had lunch and I had to box about half of mine up).  I highly recommend them. We will be back!",

There are 9 tables in this restaurant, nothing fancy but cloth tablecloths on the tables. We had the steak Salad which is huge. It had marinated steak with roasted onions, red peppers, black olives, carrots and romaine. The meat was delicious and I like their balsamic dressing that had a good flavor without being too sweet. We also had the Meatball Parm sub. The bread is made in house and is delicious, the meatballs were SOOOO good. We also had a Chicken Parm dinner. The sauce has so much flavor and all of our food was top notch. The prices are reasonable and I just love that the whole family works there, speaking Italian. So authentic. I want to try the pizza and they sell it by the slice also. Glad Georgie told us how busy they gat. As we were leaving we noticed the restaurant was full at 3PM on a Sunday. We will definitely go back. Thanks Georgie, a special place it is.",

We shared an antipasto salad (large enough fo four) that was very tasty. Two of us had eggplant parmigiana . They said it was the best they ever had. I had the Rucola e Gamberetti, a mild shrimp (large) pasta dish with fresh tomatoes and angula. Delicious.  Another guest asked them to special order a pizza and the chef was nice enough to accommodate his request.

While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing, something I will have to try next time.

I've eaten at B&G 4 times now and certain things have remained consistent... - Most of the food is truly yummy although I can't speak for the non-pasta dishes.   - Don't order the calamari...unless you are keen on tasteless and rubbery food. - The service is NOT good.  Tonight, we were seated at the table that is closest to the mostly open kitchen and I both saw and heard our server give our order to the chef almost an hour after we had ordered it.  15 mins prior, I had asked her to check on it and now I know it hadn't even been ordered. - They don't brew coffee!  My dad loves his coffee and three times he's been disappointed at the end of his meal when he's asked for coffee and been told, \"We don't have any that's been brewed\".  Tonight, dad thought he'd outfox them and asked for coffee when we ordered dinner, to be brought right away.  Remember what I told you about service?  She didn't remember to bring dad's coffee until the meal came and then had the nerve to say it had  to brew.  Does it take well over an hour for coffee to brew?  She forgot the sweetener, so I got up and got it.    NO APOLOGY.  A few words about my first visit... 40 minutes before closing,  they were mopping the kitchen floor which is mostly open to the restaurant, which only has nine tables.  We were trying to enjoy our food, but the overpowering smell of amonia wafting over the table and all around us, made it impossible.  I asked the server to have them stop mopping, which they did, for 10 whole minutes.  NO APOLOGY.   I will get food from them again, but only as take-out.  I will not subject myself to the incredible noise level created by kitchen staff  who drop and bang pots, pans and dishes consistently or to servers who can't handle the \"pressure\" of a 9-table restaurant.  Customer service is a huge thing to me and they've missed the mark.  How is all of this acceptable to the owners?",

If they keep making food this good, it will need a larger dining area. The only possible improvement would be better silverware/plates/napkins but who cares about that!",

    "text": "We ordered garlic bread with cheese, battered mushrooms and a pizza for takeout.  The mushrooms were the highlight.  The batter was crisp and light without being greasy and the mushrooms inside were tender and delicious.  The garlic bread had much too strong of a garlic flavor and I wasn't able to eat more than a few bites before I gave up.  We ordered our pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and sausage.  I expected it to be a little greasy due to the toppings, but it was so greasy it overpowered the flavor.  It's not something I'd order again.  Basil & Garlic may be a victim of high expectations based on the reviews here, but I don't think we saw enough to come back for a second try even though the mushrooms were pretty decent.",

    "text": "This was our 1st time I had the shrimp in wine sauce special dish for the night. I was asked what pasta I wanted and I chose rigatoni.  After a long wait for our meals the waitress came out and said something about not having enough and a longer wait but I could have penne now. It takes less than 10 min to cook pasta so I'm not sure what that was all about. The meal came out and it was so bland - no flavor- not worth the wait at all.  They forgot the name of their restaurant - because had they put basil and garlic in the dish the dish might have gotten a higher score.  When I told the waitress it was bland, she didn't seem to care or she has heard that before.  We won't be going back.",

Being a Nutella lover, I had to try the Nutella pizza (made with the pizza crust, Nutella, and topped with strawberries). As everything else, it was amazing! Will be going back many more times! Everyone at the restaurant was so friendly and welcoming! The owner, Claudio was genuinely nice.",

The pizza is perfect and reminds me of real Brooklyn pizza with a perfect crust, the right amount of cheese and served hot.  I recently had the mussels in red sauce.  It may have been the best I've ever had!  My prediction is that we'll be hearing more about Claudio and Nadine.",
