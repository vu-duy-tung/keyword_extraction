    "text": "Decided to come here after work for an early dinner with Dad.  I'd seen the Diners Drive Ins and Dives segment on their main location in Ahwatukee, read some of the Yelp reviews, and checked out their menu beforehand.  What I wanted was good Mexican food fast and cheap.  Mission accomplished.  Their newest location in central Phoenix is in what I believe used to be part of the space that Coffee Plantation occupied back in the day.  Its in a pretty hidden part of a crowded strip mall on the northwest corner of 16th St & Glendale.  Parking was a chore, but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  I had expected a pretty bare bones Mexican taco stand feel (similar to Tacos Atoyac) when I walked inside, but the place is surprisingly modern.  Much more like a Chipotle than a Tacos Atoyac.  We both got the Carne Asada Burrito meal.  I know their staples are the street tacos, but I was in the mood for something a little more hearty.  The burrito didn't disappoint and came with a side of beans and rice.  Plus two drinks, the total tab was just $18.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes, though its certainly comfortable enough if you want to hang around for awhile, and the outdoor patio is a nice touch.  Staff was friendly too.  Not sure the food was as good as Tacos Atoyac (just a few miles west of here), but then again Tacos Atoyac is way divyer than this place.  For the more affluent north central crowd, Los Taquitos fits in very well with the neighborhood.  Its affordable, comfortable, and fast.  Just be sure to pack your patience when looking for a parking spot around here.",

Tuesdays are taco tuesdays apparently so the carnita, pollo asada and pastor tacos are only a dollar a piece.  They were all solid, but my favorite was probably the steak - not a special but reasonably priced and probably the best I've ever had.  We also had the red chile burrito which was very meaty.  It was very good, but a bit too much after a while.    I definitely want to try the bombito one day and the street tacos were awesome.  Parking is kind of hard in that complex, they seem a bit territorial with the spaces along the stores..  The bathrooms were much nicer than I thought they would be so don't avoid going in there like I was doing at first!  :P",

The menu features all of your mexican favorites, from street tacos to burritos to quesadillas to a delicious shrimp civiche.  The food is exceptionally priced (think around $5.00 or less for pretty much any item), but is no indication of the excellent quality and delicious flavors that await you in every bite!  The margaritas were absolutely phenomenal, and had I not been the driver, I would have been stuck there for hours just trying all of the different flavors available (such as Blood Orange, Prickly Pear, and Pomegranite).  Their salsa selection was also extensive, ranging from a light, tangy Pico de Gallo, to their uber-spicy jabenero salsa (eat with caution!!).  The location is convenient, the atmosphere was fun and casual (the place is small, but cute), the patio area (although tiny) was nice (and covered), and the owners were all SO friendly. Yes it was the Grand Opening, but I was still impressed that ALL involved made the effort to mingle with each table, introduce themselves, and chit chat throughout the evening.  Overall, I give this place a solid two thumbs up!",

    "text": "I moved near Los Taquitos about two months ago, and it's funny that I've yet to write a review, considering I eat here at least three times a week.  I really love all the food here, but my favorite is the cheap veggie burrito.  It's the best damn veggie burrito in my sometimes sketchy memory.  Strange enough, and it's no lie, the second best was in Galway, Ireland.    Margaritas are excellent, and can be had for a mere $3 between 4-7.  Mmmmm.  They squeeze limes and use agave nectar for sweetening.  Very tasty.    Also try their chile rellenos if they happen to be at the bottom of the menu when you visit.  I want to go swimming in the sauce they pour over the chile.  Love the breakfast torta, slathered in a generous pour of the green salsa.  Great pico?  Absolutely.    I can't really write enough nice things about this restaurant, and the fact that you have a 20% chance of seeing me there at any given time should testify to my True love.  My only complaint is the styrofoam cups and plastic plates.  I really hate styrofoam.  Get real plates!!!",

Been here several times but our latest visit might be our last. July 15, a slow Saturday afternoon around 2. Around 2-3 other customers inside. We chose to sit at the small bar area for some margaritas and fish tacos. Four female employees in sight- one cashier, one sweeping, one coming back and forth with supplies and one behind the cashier, playing on her cell phone. We sat at the bar for approximately 15 minutes, with no greeting or acknowledgement whatsoever. I then asked the sweeper if we would be helped. She was kind and hollered out to someone to help us. Another 5 minutes went by, nothing, so we decided to leave. There are so many other eateries in that area so we took our business and money elsewhere.",

    "text": "I NEVER post reviews....this time was absolutely necessary. Myself and two other coworkers ate here for lunch today and very soon after began to feel sick. Each of us felt nauseous and found ourselves going back n forth to the restroom with bad stomachs. We each became physically sick in more ways than one if you know what I mean...  it has been about 7 hours since we ate our food and are our bodies are still feeling extremely sick and rejecting the food we ate.   Our meals were inexpensive. One paid only 4$. Another paid about 8$ and I paid about $10.   It's not about the money. We definitely will never eat here again.   And to top this whole experience off, the manager, Rocio,  had the nerve to say \" ARE YOU SURE?\" \"You MUSTVE ate something else.\" \"The chicken and carne asada are our best sellers\"  AND THEN  \"Normally if something were wrong with the food, MORE people would be sick.\"       I was beside myself.  I told her well 3 people that decided to speak up seems like a lot to me.   Who knows if others are not saying anything. She then proceeded to say, \"so do you just want your money back?\"    I said yes, that's the least than you can do here.     If you are going to eat here, just be cautious.  Don't be surprised.  If you have any issues that you need to bring to the attention of management, expect to be spoken to in a dismissive manner.  I hope I feel better by the end of the night tonight and do not need to go to urgent care.   This is painful.",

Today I ordered a bowl of menudo Bc it's Saturday and they have it! The menudo was good definitely did it's job! Still no where close to Nana's menudo.  I also ordered guacamole which was dumb expensive. The Guac was whipped in green mush. It's more like Guac you buy per maded at Sprouts. So don't wast your money. I also think the waitresses should drop the food at your table for you. Great food but the establishment needs to decide if it's a take out restaurant and stay in and dine. Still the food",

The Carnitas was amazing and the Pastor was even better. Overall I had 5 tacos and I still wanted more. In addition, we made in time for Happy Hour and got a $4 House Margarita. That was also perfect - sour, strong, and barely taste the tequila. The service was also welcoming, helpful, and sweet. I'll definitely be coming back!

There have always been times when the customer service was curt, to say the least, but it's really becoming annoying. Geez people, act like you're glad we're there.   The other thing is the enchiladas.  God knows, I've had lots of them in my lifetime and I think I know a good one when I taste it. It took me awhile to order one because I LOVE the tacos so much but I did order the enchiladas once and it was literally horrible.  Okay, maybe it was just a fluke so after a few visits I decided to try again. Still horrible.  How can everything I've tried there be so good and the enchiladas the worst I've ever had?  I don't get it.  I hope they read this and correct these 2 things because I hate that I don't like it there anymore.",

I also loved their beans and rice and I used to go on my lunch break or after lunch to grab a margarita during happy hour as well! Those are strong and so the job!  I'm a fan!   When I found this location which is much closer to my house , I brought my fiance and he is now almost a weekly regular!  I'm so impressed with the consistency of the locations . The food is just as amazing in Phoenix. The people that work at both these locations are always friendly.  I've now ventured out to try burritos and , pozole as well as enchiladas! All great!

This location is very nice and contemporary compared to the original location.   This could do very well in North Scottsdale with the decor if it was located somewhere else.  The burritos are very good but if you come here you must have the street tacos and the carne asada in particular.   The Carna Asada is awesome in the burrito or tacos and you can't go wrong, but would recommend trying other items.  I like the fact that you order at the counter and that they call your name. Makes it very informal and casual.   I will definitely come back to this location over and over.    All i can say is great food and very nicely decorated location.",

Not to mention the food I got was below room temperature cold. However, my girlfriend really enjoyed her food so we decided to give it another try. I order her food and checked the receipt after I paid and was overcharged by several dollars. Again, barely apologetic. They did refund me the overcharge but this is the second strike and I've had it with this place.",

My dad had the bombero burrito and he liked it and he likes spicy food but said he wouldn't order it again. The bombero sauce has a little smoky flavor and neither of us are a fan of the smoky flavor in sauces unless it's barbeque.   My nephew had the chicken enchiladas with the green chili sauce and he liked them.   VERY affordable good food. I would go back. :-)  I believe they are remodeling which they need to do mostly cuz of the order area, soda area, and condiment area.  It is so congested in that area. It was FREEZING in there today, they need to turn the heat on.",

I definitely recommend trying the Carnitas Burrito chimi style and my husband absolutely loves the Chicken  Burritos az style.  Don't forget the green salsa.  It's amazing.  For the price that your paying, they give you a pretty big portion.  I usually don't get any sides, because the burrito is more than enough to keep me satiated.  They also serve margaritas and cervesas.  It's a nice place to sit down and relax while eating and since it's not in a busy location, there's never a line and always plenty of places to sit.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I wish more people knew about this place.  It's 100x better than Filibertos and more affordable than Chipotle.  Heck, even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place.  Check it out.",

We've been in Phoenix for almost 5 months and have been on a mission to find a good taco joint. Not a taco restaurant, but a taco joint and we found it at Los Taquitos.   I ordered the street taco meal: 2 carne asada and 1 chicken. The carne asada was seasoned well, the chicken needed a little more flavor and was a wee bit dry. The rice & beans were good and were not an afterthought. My husband also got the street taco meal, but instead of chicken he got the fish taco. He liked the fish, but said he would get 3 carne asada next time.   The street tacos were a little in the small side, I don't know if there is another type besides street tacos that are a little bigger. We dined in and it would have been nice to have a complimentary basket of chips & salsa while we waited for our meal.  We live about 15 minutes away, but will make the trip again very soon. I'm looking forward to trying the Bombaro.",

I honestly think that if more businesses took the time to check out their Yelp pages, then less businesses would have poor reviews.   and   2. If more businesses chose to do something to improve the perception of their business that the reviewer has in the case of poor reviews then more businesses would be flourishing.  That being said, I must praise Los Taquitos for doing both.  I have not had a chance to come in to eat again at the 16th st. location, but will make a point to do so in the near future....so look for another update.  But, if the personality and customer service that I received from the owner I spoke with (Rosie) shines through to the rest of her staff on my next visit, then I have no doubt my update will be a rave review!  Stay tuned........",

I wasnt hungry but after seeing someone receiving their breakfast quesadilla, I had to try something. I chose the breakfast torta, scrambles eggs, chorizo beans and avacado- a few of my favorite things. My son got the regular quesadilla and my wife got her posole. We had to pay extra for the chips but the salsa's made it worth it- the green was my favorite but the red was better than most restaurants we visit- we didnt touch the chunky as it seemed to have too many onions for my taste. The Torta bread wasn't very thick, but I am not a big fan of huge bread slices- it was toasted nicely with butter and although I couldnt taste the beans- it had a nice combination of the ingredients. My wife's posole was tasty but didnt have much corn and she left unsatisfied as that is her favorite part, my son had a side of beans he layered on his quesadilla and what he didnt finish I helped out with.   Good food, I would definitely come back, hopefully hungrier so that I could trr the shrimp burrito or enchiladas with an egg on top.",

The best thing about this location is the pretty ladies that work there.  :)  I've been here twice to lackluster dining experiences.  Today I ordered the special which was a chimichanga and drink for $6.99. Not bad except for the fact I got the wrong chimichanga. I got chicken instead the beef chimichanga I ordered.  I also ordered the rolled tacos which is an order of 3 taquitos for $5.25.  If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality, the amount served should be twice that.  The rolled tacos are OK just way over-priced.  I'd really like to give this place one more try which is something that I never due after two really mediocre experiences.  They do serve beer and wine so it might just be a nice place to relax and have some chips and salsa.  I've only been during lunch when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Maybe the cool crowd hangs here during the evenings. Who knows?  We'll see.",

No matter the combination, it is never more than $12.... and would be cheaper if we went for $1 Taco Tuesdays.  The food is flavorful and spicy, and the service is excellent (we're big fans of Jessica).",

I wasn't disappointed.  I brought my kids (ages 2-8) with me and we were all happy.  To make matters better, it was Saturday and happened to be happy hour ($1 street tacos).  The street tacos were delicious (and I sampled some of the kids food from the kids menu, the flour tortillas are amazing).  I went again for lunch by myself the other day.  You get the picture.  It was great.  Will definitely be a regular spot for me.",

Chilaquiles with Monterey jack.. what? The place is obviously ran by Mexicans.. like me. So, they should know that chilaquiles go with mexican queso fresco and onions or queso cotija as dressing on top and sour cream. NOT SANDWICH OR QUESADILLA CHEESE! My son ordered the chorizo and eggs plate and only took a few bites and left it. I tried it and it was over cooked and dry. Maybe they should just stick with making tacos which for the other comments here seem to be good at. Also the woman at the counter wasn't so welcoming and when I spoke spanish to her she kept on replying in English but, talk spanish with her co workers?.. beats me. Overall the place is nice and clean and the tables don't wable like other places. Maybe we'll be back one more time for the tacos before we leave.",

So I go and ask the lady taking the orders why the tacos don't have salsa, and she says to me \"the salsa is on the counter over to the side, you can get it yourself \" I say what? But the menu says your street tacos come with 3 toppings and we only deducted 1 of them. Are they not supposed to give me the other 2 toppings? Cause otherwise why is it in the menu that it comes with salsa? Then she finally admits \"the cook was supposed to put the salsa in the kitchen before it was handed to you\" to what I just said Wow! Didn't you just tell me \"we are supposed to get our own?\". Needless to say I am not a big fan or lies and when it's a business providing a service to me it's the worst.

The salsas were great with good heat.  The carne asada street tacos were perfect and the cheese enchilada was soft, cheesy and tangy.

But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it is made fresh and they are humans. However, they can occasionally mess up your order, but will fix it for you no problem.

If you are staying at the Hilton and want quality food and service, you won't be disappointed.  Stay away from Aunt Chiladas across the street from Hilton it's horrible.",

The margarita was great, excellent flavor and gave me a nice little buzz. The tacos were delicious... so good that we both went back for another full order at 6:58! The place was doing a solid business which is nice to see in a small place and filled with all types of people - a couple families with small kids, elderly and young people.   Looks great too -  nice open door patio with lights, restaurant is clean, nice bar and tv. Only wish that there was a salsa bar. Service was great and attentive. We will be back for the daily 4pm -7 happy hour for sure.",

The interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.  I have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.  The only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!",

The veggie burrito actually had more on it then I was expecting, it's simple but had lots of flavor for sure. I am still not sure about the salsa, it was different and had a nice bite but might take a bit to get used to.  All in all I am very happy we have a vegan friendly Mexican spot in this area of Cen Pho that has good food and service.",

The place is always clean and or being cleaned, the prices are great, the food is awesome and there is barely any wait to get your food. Its a great place to stop for a snack or a meal anytime. Plus they have amazing breakfast burritos and quesadilla's that are served 24 hours.  Since becoming a patron, I have enjoyed the following items the most: bombero chicken burrito, chicken taco's, pastor burrito, pastor torta, chicken nachos, chilaquiles with red sauce, breakfast quesadilla and burrito with chorizo and green chile pork burrito. They have great red and green salsa in bottles so you are free to use as much or little as you need. They serve alcohol as well, if you prefer your tacos with  beer or wine. Overall, it's a great place with good food that you should definitely check out.",

Food for me was pretty average; it was tasty and hit the spot for sure but it wasn't anything I would crave. That being said, I did wolf down my carne asada tacos with reckless abandon. The meat had a tinge of pink (which I loved) and was tender, nicely marinaded and would have been perfect with just a smidge more salt. Mine came out with out the prerequisite onion and cilantro, so double check for that. Beans and rice that come with meal were so not a generous portion....but it was all good since the rice was a wee bit bland, I suggest beans over rice for sure. Love the pickled carrots, and jalapenos at the salsa bar, but I wished they had salsa that you could dip out instead of the few squeeze bottles.  When I was there, one table had basically all of the salsa bottles, leaving everyone else to either ask if they were finished, wistfully wish they would hurry up and finish or do without.   They do serve drinks, and have a pretty big menu, which is supplemented with brunch specials. Nice spot for an easy quick meal.",

More on that later but first let me rant about how insulted I am to see \"safe\" Mexican restaurants springing up that cater to squeamish diners.  For example, Mucho Macho Taco, Urban Taco, Phx Burrito House and Gadzooks, these restaurants don't serve Mexican food.  They serve canned Mexican themed food for people who are scared to go authentic.  Now that my gripe is out of the way, let me say first that Los Taquitos IS authentic.  It was my first visit so I tried all the staples that measure a Mexican restaurants authenticity - beans, rice, red chile sauce, lengua (beef tongue) and menudo.  Yes, I ate all of that PLUS a fish taco and all of it was good.  There's a bar with a decent selection of Mexican beers, and lots of different kinds of margaritas.  I saw some liquor bottles but didn't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not.  Finally, the other things I liked about Los Taquitos was the decor, clean bathrooms and, you'd think this would be more common, decent music.   All of that adds to an enjoyable experience, and a return visit by me.",

I ordered Pozole and 2 chicken tamales... And I came right back today! Today I ordered the enchiladas and 2 more of those delicious chicken tamales!!! The pozole was amazing!!! The soup comes with your choice of corn or flour tortillas of chips on the side. Oh and I had to order take out, food was hot and prepared great! Everyone was nice and professional. Very clean establishment. I can tell very fresh ingredients! As far as the pic the enchilada literally rolled / were upside down from my driving so I am not sure how the original presentation was. The enchiladas were half rojo half verde (red/green) which is really nice for an indecisive individual as myself lol! They were pretty good, I've had better, but I overall I would order again. Did I mention the tamales?!?! I put verde on them so flavorful... I must confess I think I am in love with them! Great prices and I hear there is $1 taco Tuesday!  Update: today is 12/17 I have a problem and literally addicted to this place lol! 3rd day in a row!!! Tried lengua taco, best I've had in my life and I have tried many at other places. Asada quesadilla is good... A different seasoning on the meet that I have not had before... Maybe it's chipotle because I usually don't order that flavor but still tasty. And the Horchata is unbelievably awesome!",

We had the street tacos meal which comes with rice and beans.  Perfect size for lunch and a lighter meal.  The burrito with carne asada was unbelievably tender and flavorful. I recommend trying everything!",

The tortas. I placed a phone order for two tortas to take back to my office. I ate about 1/3 of my sandwich and threw it out. No kidding it was that bad, and I'm really not a picky eater. It had flavor but soo soggy. The other torta was the same way, threw it out. So... this is a really nice place and I'm sure most of their menu is fine, especially the El Pastor tacos, but stay away from the tortas.",

I was craving me some tacos on a Tuesday so naturally I stumbled into this place.   I tried their chicken taco, carnitas taco, and al pastor taco. My favorite was easily their al pastor. The meat was seasoned to perfection and the flavors were as an al pastor taco should be. Next favorite was the chicken and last was the carnitas. Normally I'm a huge carnitas fan but they must marinate their carnitas with something that doesn't really tickle my fancy. I still ate it, don't get me wrong but it wasn't my favorite. I ordered my tacos with a side of rice and beans and the total came out to be about $5.30 or something like that. Basically, an amazing deal. I didn't even finish all of my rice and beans because I was so full! Each street taco comes with two little tortillas.   The staff was friendly and the rest of the items on their menu looked great too. They also have a bar where margaritas and beer can be ordered. They have happy hour so I can only imagine they have awesome deals. The inside is much more appealing than the outside so don't judge a book by it's cover! I will definitely be heading back there.",

I don't believe in leaving a tip to place an order which I didn't.   I felt like the employees frown upon it and treat you sub standard if you don't leave a tip. They asked many customers if they wanted carrots and sauce. They didn't even offer either to me. Mater fact, I felt they were very abrupt and dismissive.",

The decor inside Los Taquitos is reminiscent of a Dia del Muerte pageant. Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food.   On this visit I  tried each of the three tacos and a chille relleno.  Everything was delicious; the tacos pastor was incredible. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen, and on Taco Tuesday at $1.00 a taco, I just might.  I would highly recommend a stop at Los Taquitos for lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy; but really delicious food,great service, and wallet friendly pricing.",

When she asked which meat I wanted, I asked her which was the most popular and she replied with \"They are all good\".  I'm sure they are, but I wanted to know which was most popular!  I order the steak street tacos and they are excellent and have lots of flavor.  The beans and rice that come with the plate taste good and are not heavy after you eat them.  The dining area is very clean. The tables and chairs can be moved around to accommodate most parties.  There is also additional dining patio, but depending on the time of the year, you might not want to sit out there as it will be too hot.  I'm pretty sure evenings must be really nice to sit out there.  I will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix, hopefully to try other things on the menu, but I really love street tacos overall.",

I settled on carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco. When the girl finally appeared, she took my order and I handed her my credit card. As she swiped it, she started talking to the girl behind me. I signed my reciept, assumed that was it and walked away to wait.  Carne Asada Street Tacos: They were good, the tortillas were nice and hot. Plentiful of meat. But I've had better...from a food truck no less. The green salsa I found was good but not spicy.  Fish Street Taco: The fish was great in flavor, from the little piece that was given to me. I had to remove half the cabbage before taking a bite. It seemed they were making up for the lack of fish with cabbage.  The bar area was really nice, it looked almost like a club. Flat screen was playing golf.  Regardless, I wouldn't be returning here.",

The red chile beef enchilada was outstanding. The chorizo breakfast burrito was plentiful but lacked the spice and full flavor that I like out of my chorizo. The marinated pork burrito deep fried and smothered in red sauce was a bit on the sweet side for Mexican cuisine but it was good and, like everything else, big enough to get all the value out of the price paid. We didn't partake in the bar offerings but the margaritas tempted me. We also dropped the ball on looking around before ordering as we missed the specials board for Taco Tuesday at a buck a piece. The value was great and we will be back to try the red chile beef and green chile pork burritos. Glad we finally tried this place after living close by for more than 2 years.",

They were exactly what you expect. Very straightfoward flavors. were tasty but nothing amazing. The Guacamole was good but again nothing amazing.  Price was about $8 for three small street tacos, no sides,  and was a good lunch portion. Again reasonably priced but not a great deal.  There are other taco shops in the area that I would go to before this one (Santos Lucha Libre)",

I've used Los Taq to cater too (pick up) and was thrilled with the experience. A note for those who are looking for the \"Cheers\" environment: My husband and i are there anywhere from 2-5 times per week.

I have to say the chips were some of the worse chips I have ever had. They were extremely dry and seemed old. The salsa was more of a pico and again very dry. Mostly chopped tomato and onion. The burrito could not have been more disappointing. The tortilla again seemed old and dry (sorry about the theme here...but dry was the theme of the night) and while I ordered the burrito wet, not only did they not put enough sauce on it, the flavor was mediocre. The beef was actually pretty good, but again...a little dry.",

    "text": "Gotta love it when fellow Foodies put together tweetups that involve food and drink, even better when that get together happens at a restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives that you've wanted to try out for ages.  Kirti Dwivedi and Susie Timm decided to gather tweeps at the grand opening of Los Taquitos' newest location on 16th and Glendale avenues in Mid-town Phoenix for a nosh and adult beverages. Thirty or so twitter and Facebook users responded to the tweetvite, showed up, queued up and got down to the business of eating.  First up a margarita made with Tres Agaves tequila and freshly squeezed Blood orange juice. I'm a big fan of the tangy sweetness of blood  oranges and am glad to see them used in this upscale taqueria.  The much talked about 'Bombiero' burrito was served up as my entree, full of slow cooked carnitas, pico de gallo, and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and bathed in Los Taquitos signature sweet and fiery 'Bombiero' sauce.  I found the pork to be perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, the pico fresh and vibrant but the sauce was a bit overpowering in it's sweetness. I was really looking for this sauce to have a much higher level of heat and spice, but over-all, sweet was the strongest note that I experienced. In my opinion, this sauce would be perfect if the sweetness was dialed down and the heat increased.  Other tweeps at my table enjoyed their carne asada tacos with rice and beans and we all munched on that taco shop staple, chips and salsa/guacamole. I'm looking forward to trying several other dishes including the tacos al pastor and am quite happy that Los Taquitos has opened up on my side of the valley.  If you fancy a bit of up-scale taqueria cuisine, get to one of Los Taquitos' locations and have a go at the menu, you'll certainly not be disappointed.",

    "text": "A good friend of mine brought me here yesterday after raving about the amazing street tacos and salsa. I'm always down for good Mexican food so we hopped in the Mom-mobile and were on our way!   I ordered the Friday special which was 2 hand tacos with choice of rice or beans. You could choose chicken or beef and I asked for one of each and asked for a side of beans as well as I wanted to get the full flavor. My friend had the street tacos pastor, asado, and carnitas style.We also shared chips and salsa with guacamole.  I ended up getting 2 beef tacos and no beans. I didn't want to make a stink about it because I didn't pick the restaurant but when I asked at the counter about the beans, they said they would bring them out and never did. Luckily my baby had beans with his cheese quesadilla so I did get to try them but meh..they were just ok. The spanish rice was under-seasoned and all I could taste was salty chicken broth. The guacamole was pretty tasty though the avocado was overpowered by the salsa that was mixed in to it. The salsa was very tasty. And I was kind of surprised that the chips and the hard shells on the tacos weren't house made or if they were...they've got it down to such a science that they seem store bought.   My friend enjoyed his street tacos but he agreed about the rice being under-seasoned and over-brothed.   The staff at the counter were nice, but they were firmly planted there. No one came by the tables to check on people and even though we chose to sit outside, they didn't move from their spot to let us know our food was ready.   I'll go back to try again if we are in the area because my friend really likes it there and I want to try to get what he's seeing but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back without him.",

The seasoning of the meat, the taste and texture of the beans and the rice, the kick of the salsas - everything is the way it should be. The staff is very friendly and the list of offerings is in plain sight, on a chalkboard menu above the counter area. Prices are great! The place is clean and has a very relaxed atmosphere (and the Food Network on the flatscreen at the bar during lunchtime ... very sneaky way of encouraging a big appetite). Nice bar area, and even an outdoor al fresco dining area where you have a view of the Phoenix Mountains. Lots of things to like about this place!",

I've had a variety of street tacos: asada, pastor, carnitas, fish, and shrimp (what can I say, I love tacos) with a side of rice and beans. All were enjoyable. The food was ready in a reasonable time and the restaurant wasn't too busy. Unfortunately the seating is limited and there are no comfy booths. Also, the ambiance is a little bland. But I will definitely return in the future and recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "I really love when I go to a restaurant and I am able to get a unique flavor that I can't find anywhere else. This love of mine gets harder and harder as I try more Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. Los Taquitos reassures me that these places still exist though, and they do it with the Bombero. The Bombero's sauce is an enchilada-style kind of sauce with the twist of ketchup tang. It threw me off a little at first because I didn't know exactly what to expect, but as I munched on each bite, and the spiciness of the sauce began to take over, I knew that my taste buds had made a new friend. The al pastor and the chips were also very tasty, but I don't think many people will be blown away with those items like I was with the Bombero.   I also want to add that the staff was extremely friendly during my visit. The cashier walked me through what I should try (recommending the Bombero if I was a fan of heat) and she didn't once seem impatient. That's always a huge plus to me.   I'll definitely be back soon! I already find myself craving that Bombero sauce. You should definitely check Los Taquitos out if you're in the neighborhood. It's solid Mexican food at decent prices. If they add a happy hour, this will definitely be a busy spot! Next up for me, the original location!",

Walking in it's nicely sized. Very clean and not overpowering with stuff everywhere. They have some vintage style lights hanging in the restaurant which give it a nice little touch. Heading to the counter you are warmly greeted by the person behind the register. She asked \"would you like breakfast or lunch?\" First of all I didn't know they served breakfast but I was sure glad they did! I had the breakfast quesadilla which was... as simply as I can put it... AMAZING!!! very flavorful and good. It is spicy so if you don't like spicy then maybe you can ask them to keep the jalapenos off. I can't wait to try their lunch menu food!

They increased the taco Tuesday special price from $1 to $1.35 per taco, no biggie IF THE TACOS WERE WORTH THE INCREASE ...but they're not. Things taste different, the carnitas were full of fat chunks and cartilage/ nerves. Who wants to bite into that while trying to enjoy their tacos? NOT I. The pastor tacos were drenched in some sort of red grease sauce- completely and entirely different from before. You can taste where this restaurant has cut CORNER$.

This is definitely a take out or dine in spot, it's fast, and they basically have it set up like a fast food chain. You get in line, go to the counter, order, you get a number if you are eating there, then pick a seat. Seats are limited, so if there's a ton of people there is a chance that you probably won't get a seat.   Now, to the food. I ordered the Pastor Burrito and I got it smothered. Don't follow my footsteps and get it smothered. Get it plain, if you want the sauce, get it on the side because to me it took all the flavor of the pastor in the burrito and the overall taste out of it and you're just eating a burrito drenched in sauce. The overall pastor was good, I wish that I never got it smothered and just got it on the side. On the other hand, the fish tacos were good which I would recommend if that's what you want.  Overall, this place was good. Great place for quick lunches. Nothing exciting or memorable other than the option to smother the sauce all over the burrito. Check it out if you're low on time and want some quick Mexican food.",

The counter person puts it on the counter spilling some of the soup into the tray, then you spill more navigating it to your table. I lost a good 3 oz of soup. Bathroom was smelly and dirty.

Today I devoured the carne asada burrito, which tasted Fantastic! The spices and flavors of the meat are like no other and the flour tortillas have the natural textures of tortillas from Mexico . The house margarita had natural lemon juice mixed with the house tequila. This must have been one of the strongest margaritas I have had from any Mexican concept establishment and I did not complain one bit !",

    "text": "Not very good. I ordered the daily special, 2 hard tacos with beans. The hard taco shells may have been Old El Paso, I'm not 100% sure but they sure tasted like cheap store-brand shells. Very little meat that was way over-cooked to the point that it lost it's identity. About 2 shreds of lettuce (seriously), 1tsp of cheese (which I swear was a supermarket blend like Mexican Cheese Blend), and 2-3 tomato pieces. Very unappetizing.  The beans has an odd taste of beef tallow. Not the good kind of fat like lard, but an off-putting taste that didn't compliment the beans runny consistency.  My friend ordered the street tacos which looked better. But they said they were nothing special. My other friend had a torta and wouldn't finish it.  Oh, and they lost our order, and other customers that were there as well. I had to remind them of our order and show them our receipt as they had no record of our purchase. Over 20 minutes to get our food.  On the plus side the decor was very mexi-hipster.",

I asked what the difference was between the green and red sauce, is one more hot? She said the only difference was the color! Um, ok? So I tried the red. When I got it, it looked like a burrito in red soup. Completely soggy. But I quickly realized it had to be just so the hard, stale tortilla seemed normal! The \"chicken\" was dry and bland as well. My friend tried the street tacos which were dry and bland as well. And Filabertos has better taquitos than this place! Its like they just used their left overs that day. DONT GO THERE!!!",

The chicken also had a spicy marinade; both were double wrapped in perfect little corn tortillas.

We did venture from our favorites in the beginning and everything we had was still good but we settled on our usuals. The only menu item we didn't really enjoy was the enchiladas. They weren't horrible but definitely not anything we'd order again. It's also pretty tough to make good enchiladas in a short amount of time though (IMO).

But, I asked again recently and finally got answers! No, the tortillas are not vegan, but so much else is! See the photo I posted for details.   My go-to order now is the bean tostada with no cheese. It's perfect! The re-fried beans are delicious, and the shells are crisp and fresh. It's also easy to take to-go. I love the chips and very spicy salsa (pico) and their hot sauces (green and red). I've also tried the enchiladas with veggies (no cheese), rice and veggie tacos. The veggies are mostly onions, peppers and potatoes and it's great to find Mexican-style rice that doesn't have chicken broth. I miss the bean & veggie burrito, but am glad I can have so many other great items! Los Taquitos is back to being my go-to place for a quick and delicious authentic (yet vegan) Mexican meal.",

My buddy and I were out and about and wanted something to eat, but nothing too big since we were going to dinner later that night.  Tacos, it is!  We made our way down here and walked inside.   I went with 3 carne asada tacos, and an order of chips and guacamole.   Right around $10.00.  You pay at the counter, grab a seat and then they call your number when its ready.  Here is how everything was..............  3 Carne Asada Tacos-  Bomb!  Straight up, BOMB!  The carne asada here is probably the best carne asada I have found yet in Phoenix.  It reminds me of some of my favorite joints down in Tijuana/San Diego that cook the meat over mesquite charcoal.  It hits the meat with that great smokey flavor and just makes it taste so much better than something done on a flat top or on a regular propane grill.  The flavor is very unique, and I was happy as hell when I first bit in.  The tacos here are a bit small, but I savored every single bite of my 3 tacos.  No joke, I could probably eat 10-15 in one sitting.  Yeah, that good!   Chips and Guacamole-  Eh...just ok.  Chips were decent.  Nothing special.  Guacamole was a little too pureed for my liking.  Didn't taste bad or anything, just too smooth for my liking and didn't have the most flavor.  Have had way better guacamole elsewhere.    Overall, not as good as the Awahtukee spot, but still pretty damn tasty for some Phoenix tacos.  That carne asada is the best...that's all you really need to know/order from here.  So damn good!",

I normally get 5 or 6 of the tacos on tuesday and leave quite full all for under 10 bucks.  The hot sauce they offer is flavorful and not overpowering with spice so you can taste all the flavors.

However, in Arizona where we have SO many good Mexican and tacos places, this place failed to leave an impression.

    "text": "This visit was a long time coming. My husband has came home from work a few times saying he got the BEST street tacos for $1 each on taco Tuesdays for lunch. So as we're starving on a Friday night deciding what is for dinner, what a great time to try those amazing tacos I have been hearing so much about.   Once you walk in, it's a small restaurant with tables, a small bar, and a little patio. You walk up to order and then they call your number when it's ready. So great place for a quick Mexican dinner or take-out. No salsa bar and no sit down service.   When we first walked in, the girl at register Elisa, just stared at us so we began to order and she just said \"ok, what else?\" No welcome, no have you been here before, no how may I help you.... Frankly she had no personality and may have been the most miserable person I have ever met. Cheer up buttercup! My husband was surprised because all the other ladies previously have been very nice to him.   So erasing the first impression the lady at the register gave me, I moved on to the food with a clean slate. I got the 3 street taco combo with 1 carnitas, 1 carne asada, and 1 el pastor. They were all super good! All the meat was very  juicy and flavorful. The El Pastor was my favorite! Very good with so much flavorful. The carnitas was my second favorite. I added sour cream and their green sauce which made it over the top good. The rice and beans were simple but good.   Overall I'm hoping the service is normally better but the food was really good and came out quick. I will be back for more and recommend to others.",

The shrimpys have perfect grill marks on them. My husband gets the street tacos, but loads up on the meat ones...pollo, asada, barbacoa and carnitas and he devours them. The verde and red salsas that we pour onto each taco have a kick and great flavor. Don't pass on a Happy Hour margarita while you're there either. For $4.00, you get one of the best margs of your life. They are from scratch and contain zero artificial sweeteners or nasty sweet & sour mix.   My only complaint so far is weak guacamole. It makes me sad to type that, but it's True. The guac is kind of watery and flavorless. If they would improve the guac, this place could take over the world.",

    "text": "Big disclaimer about this review.....  I was finishing up my meal when I saw the waitress bring a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce to the condiment area.  Apparently, they have 4 bottles for the entire restaurant and a couple of customers decided to bring them to their table.  I didn't know that.  Chips/salsa are $2.49 and they charge for pico so I passed on both.  That being said, you're about to read a review for a Mexican food with no pico, no salsa, no red sauce, and no green sauce.    I ordered the \"Choose 3\" meal and got one asada, one carnitas, and one fish taco.  The meal option adds rice and beans.  All 3 were a bit dry (see above).  They just don't naturally come with a lot of wetness.  They have jalapenos and lime in the condiment area, but they are stored uncovered and they were dry as well.  The tacos were a little too bland for my taste, especially the fish taco.  The rice and beans are average.  The total was $7.12 but I did not get a drink.  I'm a \"sauce whore\" at Mexican restaurants so you can take or leave my opinion on the food.  I'm used to having plenty to spread around and it's a bit of a turn-off to have to pay extra for it.  Overall, the place is nice.  The service is friendly.  The food comes fast.  But it seems they need to choose whether they want to be a \"street taco\" kind of place or a regular Mexican restaurant.  If you order a 3-taco set, plus the chips/salsa, plus the pico, plus a drink, you're going to be close to $15 for your meal served on plastic plates.  For that price I'd probably go to more of a sit-down restaurant with a full menu.  I'll give them another try when they have their \"taco Tuesday\" special where you can get them for $1 each.  And hopefully the sauce bottles will be available....",

Not to say that we could replicate what they produce or that there are better ideas for dinner, I meant to say 'Los Taquitos is our go to place for great food, friendly service and reasonable prices'.  Typically we get the veggie burro (bean, rices, potatoes, peppers and onions) with a side of bombero sauce (which is super delicious spicy goodness).  Chips and salsa is great as well, with a sometimes spicy serrano and red onion dominated, almost pickled salsa.  They also have a red and green sauce to vary up the bites on your goodies, but I typically roll bombero sauce.  I would probably drink the stuff if they let me.  Family and friends dig into the carne asada burros and street tacos and everyone we've taken here has been very happy with the food.  Check the specials board as it changes on occasion and we've had some great rellenos and tamales at Los Taquitos as well.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, I really did. I had a super craving for mexi-food and unfortunately where I live(N. Scottsdale) doesn't have too many authentic options. I have grown up eating mexican food from my own nana's,  & my tia's, prima's, nino's... (you get the idea) so I consider myself an accredited taco critic. I ordered an asada and a fish taco, which also came with rice and beans. The rice was the best part of this meal. The fish was unidentifiable and very mushy, it came grilled(? I'm not even sure). I took maybe two bites and that was it, salsa couldn't even save this. I personally prefer the baja style and would recommend rubio's or basically any other place for fish tacos, unless you like canned tuna fish in a corn tortilla. I'd also like to throw out there I thought their salsa lacked flavor and was watery! Ugh!!! Tragic!!! The carne asada was only slightly better it came out room temperature and had an odd smoky flavor. I'm all for grilling food but I get the feeling this carne had maybe been grilled a day or two before and reheated? However, my boyfriend had an asada burrito and his carne was considerably better. All in all a disappointing experience and I will not be coming back. I am curious as to how this place was chosen to be featured on Food Network?! Hopefully for their sake this was just a bad day for them and they step their taco game up. As for me, my venture for great tacos is aimed further South (:",

It's a great street style taco shop and they serve breakfast,lunch and dinner. Their food is all good and authentic. If you are staying close by at the Hilton Squaw Peak and you want to eat some good Mexican food, head on over. I highly recommend the tacos.

    "text": "Poor service when they get busy!!!  Overall, I love this place.  However, I was really frustrated with the service today!  I decided to bring lunch to my kids at school and they specifically requested Los Taquitos!  They could have said, McD's or any other fast food joint, but they didn't!  It was 20 minutes before their lunch hour started.  I thought that would be plenty of time since their school is only 5 minutes away. Luckily, there was only 1 other person in front of me when I got there.  However, after I ordered, they got slammed!  I watched several people get their order before me, while I watched the blonde add stickers to the salsa instead of paying attention to the orders at the window.  I was wondering if she was ignoring mine because it was a TO-GO order.  Regardless, I had to go up to the counter and let her know my order was sitting there.  It took over 20 minutes to get 2 kids meals (2 quesadillas, rice & beans) and I basically missed their lunch hour.  Talk about 2 disaappointed children & 1 disappointed mommy! :(",

It was very good though. Out whole meal with one burrito and chips and guacamole was about 7.50 which is better than chipotle and you don't need to get chipotlaway (southpark reference). The Guac was good and creamy and had a good flavor. The burrito was big enough to feed us both with the chips. I would definitely go back.",

My co-worker, who is a native to AZ and has worked by Los Taquitos for the past 5 years, had never been, and always wondered about it as it is located in a strip mall. We were worried and questioned it, but when we got there for lunch, there was a line almost out the door. They get very busy during the lunch rush, but it is well worth it. I have tried a few things, but the Chili rellano burrito is the only thing I order now. You can buy their homemade tortillas as well. My parents always ask me to bring some with when I visit. Definitely worth trying out!",

This is good stuff. There's a certain kick and complexity to the taste that you don't get in even the hearty Mexican drive-thrus like Filiberto's and such. It makes the extra cost seem worth it.  And note that I am comparing this, a relatively nice sit-down-type place, to  Filiberto's. Any comparisons to Garcias or other pre-fab GringoMex outlets aren't fair. To the GringoMex, I mean. LT blows them out of the water.  Anyway, they care about their food and it shows. The decor here is much better than in Tukee, which seems more or less like a taco shop set up in a hall closet. They even have a bar with a happy hour at this location.  The prices are higher than expected, but not extraordinary.  BTW: I think the photogenic nature of the counter help probably helped the place get that shot on Drive-in's Diners and Dives. Just sayin . . .",

The asada was okay, but the fish taco was delicious. I will come back for a Taco Tuesday meal! I shared an asada quesadilla which was okay- the salsas that they offered were fantastic; the green had a nice kick and the hotter, smokey salsa made the asada items even better. Donatella had shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas. According to Donatella, we are coming back so it must be good.",

Lately, i've been craving cheap street tacos and I've been visiting this mofo at least three times a week for the past month now.  Seriously.  There's always this female cashier there and you would think she remembers me, but she doesn't acknowledge me at all.    Let me tell you the story of this weekend.  It all started when I craved cheap street tacos again and headed over to Los Taquitos.  Two girls at the register - one was the regular who didn't acknowledge.  The other takes my order.  I give her my credit card and they have a problem with their credit card machine so they tell me to wait. Five minutes goes by, 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes go by...the two are so frustrated with this register and they are telling other customers that the machine is broken.  I notice that my to-go order is ready and my food is getting cold while I wait.  I am getting annoyed...so annoyed.  I had no cash to pay for my food, just a credit card.  20 minutes go by and I tell them to \"forget it\" and I leave to drive a few blocks to Urban Taco, which I've never been before.  The place is cute and then I order similar to my Los Taquitos order - street tacos.  I wait and I get my check -Holy Hell!  They charged me DOUBLE the price I would of paid at Los Taquitos.    I get to my destination and my mouth is salivating because I am so hungry and already annoyed about the Los Taquitos experience.  I take one bite and I was NOT happy!  It was dry, no flavor, and meh.    Even though I ate all of my food because I was starving, I got more pissed at Los Taquitos because I now crave them more! I hope they fixed their credit card machine and acknowledge me the next time I stop by.",

I like to gauge Mexican food spots off their salsas and sauces/marinades. If you can pull off a spicy hot but super flavorful sauce/salsa then you're a pretty legit spot. I ordered the Bombero burrito with chicken. I died and went to pepper heaven. It can only be described as the perfect smoky, spicy, almost mole style salsa on a burrito. I dipped every bite in more of the sauce pooled on my plate and when I was done with that, I went back to the register and ordered an entire extra side of the sauce. 10 out of 10 will eat here again.

The food is incredible, especially the tacos al pastor! I lived in Mexico City for two years and have struggled to find good Mexican tacos here in Phoenix. Although the al pastor tacos don't have the slice of pineapple on top like they do in DF, they definitely have everything else. Even the tortillas tasted amazing! My wife got the smothered burrito which was also great.   The atmosphere is nice albeit it was rather crowded when we went on a Friday night. The restaurant is clean, the service fast, and the food inexpensive. We're definitely coming back!",

The food is outstanding.  From the breakfast burritos, the Huevos Rancheros are some of the best in the valley.    The Carne Asada burrito is excellent, made with good quality meat and well seasoned.  The tacos, oh the TACOS!!!!    And to top it all off they have a small bar area and a decent happy hour.

    "text": "I ordered take-out last night from Los Taquitos, upon the recommendation of a friend and a few Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas meal  (meals come with rice and beans) and my daughter had the kid's meal with a bean burrito. We also ordered chips and salsa.  15 minutes to pickup, and it was ready when we got there.  The total was $16.75, which I thought was a bit high considering what we ordered.  The inside has an unexpected, modern bar with about five stools. The register lines are right behind those stools. It just seemed odd and out of place. The three women at the registers had their act together, but could improve on friendliness.  So, we paid and were on our way, and I remembered the lady on the phone telling me to remind the person who rings us up that we get a drink with the kid's meal. Indeed, we did need to go back and get the drink cup. I just would prefer that it wasn't my job to remind them of something when they could easily write a note or symbol on the bag to remind themselves.  So, we got home and opened it all up and tried it out. My shrimp fajitas came with the bare minimum...meaning no traditional condiments. Poor assumption on my part, I guess. None-the-less, they tasted pretty good, but nothing special.  Now the chips and salsa - I mean, how can you go wrong? You can go wrong when the salsa is so hot that it burns for your mouth for five minutes after one bite and you end up not eating them and wasting your extra $2.50.  One last issue. I noticed later that they charged me a dollar more than the price on their menu online.  Not sure I'll go back, but if I do, it will be to try the $1 tacos.",

Granted, it's new, and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood. (Watch, everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table).  Their margaritas are perfect, and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat.  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly.  Love their beans, so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos.  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in, got 2 margaritas, 5 tacos, chips and salsa, and a side of rice and beans for $15.  Such a steal.",

Perfect flavoring and combination of cilantro, onions and sauce. The homemade tortillas, refried beans, carne asada quesadillas and pollo tacos are also delicious.  They offer a great happy hour with $1 pollo, carnitas and pastor street tacos along with $3 margaritas (very tasty), beer and wine.  The service is fantastic and there is a nice patio for when the weather actually cools down!  Try this restaurant if you like authentic Mexican food - by far the best I've had since my San Diego days!!!",

    "text": "Excellent tacos.  Fresh crisp corn tortillas doubled around wonderfully seasoned meats topped with cilantro, red onions, and salsa.  The bombero burro is smothered in almost a bbq meets red chile sauce and filled with the meat of your choice and rice wrapped in a homemade tortilla.  I had a carne asada taco, pastor taco, and a carnitas bombero.  All three were very tasty.  The building is located just north of the Walgreens on the NW corner of the street and they accept all credit cards.  The inside was typical chipole-ish urban decor and super clean.  All of the staff was very nice.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 is the price.  While its definitely affordable, I can remember while in Mexico as a kid I could get 5 of these tiny tacos for a buck.  And yes, all of them were made fresh with fresh tortillas.  But more power to them.  These girls are making excellent tacos and must be making a killing at 1.50 a pop.  That being said what I had was worth coming back for more.  I know I will be back to try everything on the menu at least once.  Heres a quick break down of the menu while its not up on their website: Tacos: Pollo, Carne, Carnitas, Pastor 1.50 Shrimp/Fish 2.25  Quesadillas: Cheese 4.50 Pollo/Chorizo 5 Carne, Carnitas, Pastor 5.25  Tostadas: 2.25-4.75 Tortas: 5.50-5.75 Burritos: 4-6.75 Enchiladas: 2-2.75 Bfast burros: 4-6 Caldos:  Fri and Sat only: Menudo and Pazole 5.95",

Ordered the shrimp burrito and a bowl of pozole. Husband got a green tamale and fish taco. The shrimp burrito had a delicious white sauce that  I couldn't get enough of.  Their pozole is red and comes with fresh cilantro, minced red onion, lettuce, and tortillas on the side. The broth was flavorful and the pork super tender.  It even had just a slight oiliness on the top from the pork fat that I recognize as authentic pozole. Everything was EXCELLENT and came out piping hot .(not on a heated plate!)  I am going back tonight for some more!",

Great idea if all of the tacos were $1. I went craving carne asada, which apparently is the only one that is not $1 for Taco Tuesday. While standing there considering what to order instead, two other people came in to get the carne asada tacos for $1. Not good for repeat business. When I asked why I was told it was because beef costs more. Solution: make them all $1.25.   I ended up getting two chicken tacos and one carne asada. We took them back to work and were shocked when we opened the bag and saw how tiny they were. Now I know street tacos are smaller than regular tacos, but these were teeny! If I'd known how small they were I would have ordered more. (As I type this I'm still hungry.)  They were very good, there is no doubt about that, but I probably won't go back.",

We ordered the veggie burrito, smothered along with a shrimp burrito.  Had one bite of the veggie burrito and just couldn't do it.  The shrimp burrito was tolerable, but nothing I'd order again.  The restaurant was clean and the ambiance was cute, the only two positives I can draw from this visit.",
