    "text": "Great location for me! Nice, clean space. The drinks and food are really, REALLY good, the service is just kind of...cold? Today I had a little apple tartlet with cheddar in the crust! Delicious! The cayenne mocha had just the right amount of spiciness to make it perfect. I forget the name of the other drink that I tried, it was a mocha made with dark chocolate and orange. Amazing. The food is awesome, I've had the grilled cheese made with goat and cheddar cheeses (it's a must try combination) and the roasted beet salad, which is by far the best salad I've ever tried. The prices are in-line with everywhere else, specialty drinks $4-5, the grilled cheese was $6 and the salad was $10. The salad had the perfect beet to goat cheese ratio, but could have used quite a bit more lettuce. It was really an $8 salad. $2 more worth of lettuce next time please. I would probably five this place a 5 star rating based on food and beverage alone, but only 3 stars (still A-OK) for service. While everyone is nice, no one is really friendly. I sat at the bar the first time and no one talked to me  and my attempts at small talk were awkwardly avoided. The Refuge Cafe has a lot of positive things its doing, why not talk about it to their customers?",

We went in around Noon, grabbed a really yummy tea and a snack, and got to work.  There is great art for sale and some really cool crafts in display cases.  The place is  laid out nicely, with great lighting and nice, comfy furniture.  There was little noise and an overwhelmingly calming vibe.  The best part?  This place is owned by a charitable organization which is local and works to 'help folks get a new start in life.  I like all of these attributes and would support them just because they AREN'T Starbucks!  The fact that they are superb is just icing on the cake!",

I had it iced and will definitely be back to try it hot. I also had a egg, cheese, and potato burrito and it was so good. The red salsa they give with the burritos is amazing. The people working were nice and cheery & the store itself is beautiful. I will definitely be back to try more of the goodies.",

Apparently nothing else comes on the sandwich aside from the giant bun, which was actually the best tasting component of my entire meal (pretty sure it was bought...). I counted one sunflower seed in the entire tuna mix, and 0 jalapenos (extremely disappointed). I got the vegetarian chili soup on the side, which must have been at least 4 days old and came out lukewarm...  Well, at least they have Cholula.",

Everyone I have meet on staff has been really kind and knowledgeable of the products they brew and whatever is on tap. I love being able to talk beer and coffee with these guys. The business also has lots of great and unique items on sale around the shop. The Refuge owes its name this artwork and crafts on sale. They are products made from local refuges that are looking to showcase their skills and culture with the Phoenix community in hopes of making a little extra cash for themselves. Depending on what they have to showcase you can find some really great items for sale.  The Refuge is a great place to go for a coffee or a drink to get some work done. They have a large meeting room in the back that you can book with the guys up front that is perfect for accommodating a meeting of +10. They also have lots of fun board games available to sit and play with your pals.  A great location to go for work or to kill a few hours of time.",

Next time I came I got a simple non-fat latte, also wonderful. The coffee is a fantastic blend and does not have the bitter taste that many coffee shops have. Places (cough starbucks cough) leave their espresso shots sitting out occasionally and this results in a bitter and old tasting latte. But it was not the case here, I could see the barista making my coffee fresh, and that is an important aspect that I look for. I wish I lived closer to the area because I would be a frequent customer!",

Can't comment on the food because I didn't have any, but it gets busy here during lunch so it seems like it's worth the trip to many. It actually gets a bit loud during lunch, but the rush dies quick.  They have a seating/dining area but, also a bar upon entrance where you order food & drinks. This isn't just a coffee joint/cafe. I guess what sets them apart is that they also serve alcoholic beverages, so that's a plus.  The service was good. They were all welcoming & friendly.  Their iced soy chai latte was yummy, but there's not much about this place that impresses me. It's just okay.  FINAL THOUGHTS: it's cool.......

On our way here, we kind of missed the turn where you park - hint: you park where the big \"Catholic Charities\" building is.  When you walk in, the cafe is a good size, but on a Sunday morning, it was kind of packed with people.  We decided to prop ourselves at the front of the cashier, where the couches were.  The music was my kind of music, the coffee was good, but I just couldn't get 100% comfortable.  I am not sure if it was the noise or the amount of people that turned me off, but I just wasn't comfortable.  I did manage to work for an hour and a half so that was good.  The baristas were ok - I read on reviews they have the all kinds of different varieties of specialty coffee, but when I looked at the menu, it looked like any other place. The barista didn't ask us if we have been before and didn't get an introduction on what they offer so I settled for the almond milk chai tea and it was yummy.     Not sure if we found \"the coffee  joint\" we so desperately are searching for so our search continues.",

    "text": "The Refuge takes its name seriously: it is the most soothing of the many coffeehouses in roughly this neighborhood. It features -- prominently -- staff who are not sullen hipsters, but who are sweet and charming and helpful. It also features bizarre and wonderful coffee drinks -- lavender and chili peppers figure in them, though not in the same drink -- and a wine/beer liquor license. The spirit is distinctly soothed.  Food quality varies widely enough to keep it at a 4-star rating. The breakfast burrito is so meh that when the counter clerk somehow misunderstood my vague babbling and ordered up a breakfast sandwich for me instead, I ended up grateful and delighted, as the breakfast sandwich turns out to be much better, with lots of butter and nice soft eggs. Henceforth, I am ordering the breakfast sandwich on purpose. Pastries similarly run from the meh to the sublime, but they're priced reasonably enough to not trigger severe buyer's remorse, and they seem to change fairly often, too.  The coffee is apparently brewed for use in the amazing coffee drinks, so when consumed straight, over ice, it will put hair on your chest and, should you have any minor ailments that are ameliorated by application of caffeine, you will experience a miracle cure. I have no problem with this (it took my headache right away), but you need to be in the right mood for coffee that slaps you in the face.  The setting is industrial-bungalow-chic, with local art, free wifi, and a nice patio. I believe this is run by Catholic Charities, which may explain the effort to create an aura of spiritual peace.",

It really adds to make this burrito the stand out it is. Served with a side of salsa and big enough to share.  Not to mention this place is built on charity.

For food, I have only tried the prosciutto bruschetta... and for $3 it was good, but small (two pieces), but it definitely hit the spot!  Cupcakes are the standard make-at-home size, but only $2.  I will be sure to try them.  Today's special cupcake was a gingerbread cupcake with crushed ginger and raisins... and it was a larger size, but still only $2!  Wifi + espresso + cheap eats = me coming back again and again!",

I find some coffee shops will have great coffee but meh food. The sandwiches that come frozen and you stick them in the toaster oven. Not this place. I wasn't expecting the breakfast burrito to be so good. The mocha I got was awesome too! New favorite and stoked I only live a couple miles from here",

But I have been to refuge 4 times now and have had a great experience each time! And I even brought the world's toughest critic when it comes to coffee or lattes, my wife! She loved it! The home-made treats were delicious, too! I still need to order some food which sounds really good. Someone mentioned the grill cheese and had a photo. i want one!  I do bring my laptop and do my work which is why I visit cafe's so often. Wifi has worked great every time. I like how quiet and relaxing refuge is with comfy chairs if I decide I want one, with a friendly staff. The art on the walls created by refugees is really nice to see. I saw a Bloody Mary bar there one saturday and thought wow...next time I will come on a weekend and order one. I did just that a few weeks later, but...no Bloody Mary bar that day. I was disappointed. But not for long! I still ordered a Bloody Mary and it came with all the fixings on the side presented very nicely on classy plates! Stuffed olives, the wh... sauce, a dish of horseradish to make it as spicy as I wanted. A huge, fresh chunk of celery! Now that's a Bloody Mary! Oh I hate it in bars when there is no celery. Obviously refuge knows what they are doing.  I'll be back many more times. I need to get over there and order some food tomorrow morning! I think there's a breakfast burrito with my name on it! And the white chocolate mocha! So gooooood!",

Very peaceful the couple of times we were there, and the wifi seemed to work well. My only downside is I wish they could be open a little later. We came in with a group of friends to have a meeting and discuss our festival we're putting together, but the waiter came up and said \"um we're closed now\" not long after we sat down. In their defense, I do know it's a coffee shop and most people don't go for late coffee, I am just wishing they could afford later hours, especially since they have a whole meeting room in the back, and it would be so convenient if we could get people together when everyone has time to be off work. Also glad to support a charity effort, though I'm not big on religiosity. They don't seem overtly Christian however, so I appreciate that.",

    "text": "This is a really cool spot! It is advertised as a coffee shop, but that is not the entire story.   Non Profit: The Refuge Cafe spends 100% of their profits on charity to give back to the community. What an awesome service!  New Happy Hour Menu coming out soon (See my picture).  Cafe Esperanza: Brazilian Rainforest Alliance Coffee Excellent flavor Interesting menu of different types of coffees and espresso drinks.  Full Bar: House made Bloody Mary mix - 5$ on weekends Jalapeno infused vodka - enough said House made margarita mix - Margarita Monday's Local beers on tap - only 4 beers on tap, but they have a good variety (ipa, seasonals, etc.) Non-tap beer - good happy hour deals for watching the game.  Food: Breakfast, Lunch, and early Dinner. Great selection of food. Everything seems to be made from scratch. I only ate one thing here for breakfast so far and it tasted really fresh.  Atmosphere: I feel really comfortable in this place. I would describe the atmosphere as \"super calm\" or \"friendly.\"  Service: Excellent, friendly  Wild Cards: Fresh squeezed lemonade Smoothies Mexican coke in a bottle Etc.  Will I be back? Absolutely",

It can't just be a random thing. I have to believe it goes deeper and is a result of management. Guessing the training and hiring practices, combined with leading by example, is why the staff here always seem like they enjoy their jobs. And the interactions certainly put a smile on my face. Can't recommend enough - stop by the next time you're flying out of Concourse A, gates 1-14.",

As for the food, depending on the night, Eric or Marisol will serve up magic with a fork and knife. The pork tacos are my go-to, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Again, if you have food allergies, or dietary restrictions, let Jessica know (or whoever is taking your order) and you'll be taken care of. Again, I love this place!",

    "text": "So I frequent cafes/coffeehouse to mainly read and study so my reviews are based on keeping that in mind. Here are my top 10 reasons for coming here...  #1- It's a well lit, spacious place which has table/chairs for my serious studying but also couches/comfy chairs for the days I just want to relax and study.   #2- Outlets and free-wifi for my gadgets which is crucial.   #3- Play good music, not too loud or distracting but enough background noise so I can tune everybody out and focus on my work.  #4- Good drinks menu with plenty options for coffee, tea, smoothies, soda, etc. Maybe, they offer alcohol too but I am not too sure since I am not talented enough to study while consuming alcoholic beverages.   #5- Awesome lunch and dinner menu for my stress eating. The grilled cheese here is one of a kind, you get to combine 2-3 different types of cheese so you can get pretty creative. The bruschetta is a MUST, my friend ended up ordering it twice in the same night because it was SO good! The hummus is also really good, the barista hooked us up with extra pita bread since we ran out which leads to my #6.  #6- Pleasant and friendly staff who don't rush you with your order and are very helpful in answering questions or if you need a little briefing on the menu.  #7- FREE one refill on iced tea which is what I usually get.  #8- The profits go towards charity which makes me want to support it that much more.   #9- On the weekends, they sometimes have live music. (They also have plenty board games here so if you don't need to read/study, that's an option for entertainment).   #10- Private parking lot, never had trouble finding parking or have anxiety about having to parallel park.   Nothing is perfect, so the only drawback for me is their hours. They usually close at 7 during weekdays, I wish they were open for longer hours or maybe longer hours on Friday and Saturday.",

I can highly recommend the oatmeal made with half n half and milk. It's by far my favorite on the menu. Their breakfast burritos are pretty good as well. The French toast is a great option and the pulled pork sandwich is a very generous portion (but FYI not sweet BBQ tasting).  My favorite coffee drink has got to be the Cayenne  mocha!! It has a perfect combination of bitter chocolate (not overly sweet) and a spice of cayenne!! Their smoothies are delicious as well, made with real fruits and veggies they have frozen.   Again...you can tell I'm a regular! And I'm telling you this is the perfect everyday spot to come check out!!",

Super friendly, polite and hospitable. He took a genuine interest in where I was traveling and genuinely made my morning great!  This is not something you see often these days. I am from Dallas and when he asked where I was headed informed me he was a cowboys fan!  Though I am not A Cowboys fan I will in no way hold that against him or your shop and will return one day soon.   You need more people like him. My only disappointment was that when I went to your website there was no link to contact your company and share this terrific morning experience.   I failed to mention that the Carmel latte I ordered was far better than Starbucks. Thank you!",

I assumed \"Refuge\" meant that it was a cool place to get away from the Phoenix heat (I moved here in summer).  I thought I had just found a nice, comfy place to chill, drink a good cup of joe, and relax with a textbook.  Refuge had 5/5 stars from me previously, but now that I know, it's earned the coveted 6th star.  If you're a mocha fan, get the Haboob.  Refuge also has some spicy coffee that my husband loves and an orange-flavored coffee that tastes incredible.  I haven't had any of the plain old black coffee yet since I've had so much fun experimenting with the other fancy options.  If you'd rather have a drink, though, they have reasonably-priced mixed drinks, beer and wine, and fun food platters (hummus!) for when you study up an appetite.  Go grab a drink at a coffee-shop/bar with a social mission!",

Decided to break away from Starbucks super efficient morning coffee run to try this place. There were about four people in front of me in line when I showed up. There was only one guy working as cashier and barista, so he had to go back and forth between the two. Took over 15 minutes for me to even get to the front of the line. I had been planning on ordering food with my coffee but I could tell that was going to take too long so I just got an iced coffee and went without breakfast. While I was in line, a lady came in who had apparently called in an order. The order was ready for her, but she still had to wait in line (behind me) to pay for it. She ended up walking out-- leaving the food behind-- because of the ridiculous wait. This is morning rush, they really need to be more prepared then that for the service given. Maybe someone called in sick that day or something? I don't care to make that a repeat experience, I need to get my coffee/food and get on my way to work. Maybe go in the morning if you don't have anywhere to be for a while. Not to mention the iced coffee was not good (if I'm comparing to ANY of the other cold brewed coffee I've had at other local coffee shops).",

We watched in disbelief as the steaming triangles wafted the sweetest scent into our awaiting nostrils.  I could taste both the bacon and the maple just from the smell.  We ordered a pulled pork breakfast burrito and they grill the tortilla at the end...brilliant.  Solid flavor and a nice proportion of potatoes to eggs to pork to tortilla.  The green Chile salsa was a nice compliment, but should have been served warm. They split the burrito for the wife and I as we share almost every meal (and dessert).  Coffee is good with a nice nutty flavor.  Love cold brew!  But the scone came out...and life stopped!  Monday's are the day that they pound out scones like no other.  About to go try a strawberry lavender scone!",

What a great idea!!  We had a bacon maple scone which had just come out of the oven and wow!!  What a great mixture of flavors and the scone was a perfect consistency crispy outside and soft inside!  The pulled pork burrito was grilled like a panini ... an excellent surprise.  The pork was soft with great flavor and the mixture of egg and potato was perfect!  Great staff suggestion!!

I happened to be given the darker discolorations of the lox, causing the pieces to be very chewy. I had to eat the items separately.   Atmosphere, very quiet and chill in the morning.

    "text": "Since relocating to AZ, I've made it my mission to visit every cafe during the duration of my time here. I love the coffee culture here in Phoenix and The Refuge has been on my mind for a while now.  I'm a huge sucker for lavender flavored things and their \"The Lavender\" caught my eye, can we say it was lav(ender) at first sight?  Came in to do some studying and of course try their coffee. Got a medium, iced, Lavender which is just a latte with white chocolate Lavender simple syrup. (I know, how many times do I have to say Lavender in this review ... ) Typically priced drink and brought out to my table when it was ready. Good flavor, sweet but felt like it was lacking in the caffeine department. There's espresso in this right? Whatever, I'll take it.  Interesting atmosphere to study in, definitely not for me to say the least. The environment was loud with oldies music and overpowered by the smell of fried bacon odors wafting through the cafe. Now, now, I do love me some bacon ... but to have the entire cafe smell like a kitchen flat top stove the whole time is a bit much, too much.   I would say this place would be great to grab a to-go drink if you're not looking to be powered up, for a bite to eat or to just read a book. Noticed a couple people on their phones during my time here, so study session environment? Not so much. My table was also super wobbly, but I just had to McGyver some post-it notes so my drink wouldn't topple over onto my laptop ... or the floor. Wi-Fi was decently fast and there are outlets located along the wall areas. Parking lot is conveniently located right next to the cafe, so you don't have to worry about that except for the lack of shaded spots.",

Where in the Valley can you get a side salad (creamy balsamic vinaigrette, spring mix, croutons) with candied walnuts at zero extra charge?  4.  My order was under $35 before tip * Two beers (one bottled, one draft)  * Cucumber/jalapeno/onion appetizer * Sandwich with side * Cookie  Refuge is my new favorite neighborhood place!

There is a nice outdoor patio with shade and the inside is clean, modern with plenty of tables and comfy chairs to sit and chat or work. The young lady at the register was very friendly. Lots of coffee and drink options and some really good food choices, too. I had a latte and a breakfast burrito, the burrito was really tasty and a big portion for the price.

The woman at the counter was so helpful and very patient in waiting for my sister and I to make up our mind on what we wanted to order. I ordered the American Breakfast Sandwich ( it was only $5!) and a 16 oz. Eye Opener Coffee. Both were absolutely dee-lish! The sandwich came with a side of tasty salsa and our order was hand delivered by an older man who I am assuming was one of the owners. He was so sweet towards my little guy and chatted with me about his own family. Both the restaurant and staff were warm and inviting. I will definitely be giving them my business again.",

Great service from the staff that day.  The second day my friends and i went for coffee and it was freezing and dark inside. ..little depressing so we took our frozen bodies to the cute little patio.  We both ordered the cayenne coffee, spicey and chocolaty delicious.  The 3rd time, today, went there for breakfast, had the az sunset, which was good but not as good as my previous choices.  Wealso gad the breakfast burrito,  which was good but its contents  were wierdly distributed... more egg on one side,  more baboon in the other, enough to notice.  They also had different staff today, not as friendly,  thus the minus 1 star. I've bought 6 coffees at this point and when asked if they had loyalty cards, she rudly responded, we are out and walked away.  I already knew they were out,  but i wanted to know when they would be delivered and I'd i could get credit for my coffee purchases. ..apparently i doesn't deserve a thorough answer.  She was more concerned with keeping up the conversation with her gal friend than to do what she's there to do,  provide customer service.",

Their food is mediocre at best and it takes twice as long to get as it should.  Maybe if the refuge lost some of the pretense and sped up their service things would be better. It is indeed spacious. Has great art. Good music. And has a great rotation of draft beer. However, they're trying to be a competitor to Lux and they're a million miles away from being in the same league. Stick with Starbucks or Lux until this new business figures things out.",

    "text": "Good coffee, roasted by Cafe Esperanza and good beer on tap, including a dedicated \"Hop Head Tap\" for bitter beer lovers like myself. Happy hour from 3-6 puts their tasty draughts at $3. Wine, I believe, is also discounted. I haven't tried the food or pastries yet, but they look proper. Open wi-fi. Nice coffee house atmosphere with spacious and well lit indoor and outdoor seating. Live music on the weekends and even a conference room for meetings. They could probably do a bit more to block out the racket from 7th ave for the outdoor seating area, but the place has only been open for a few weeks.   The cafe features arts and crafts made by refugees who were resettled in the Phoenix area. Proceeds from cafe go to funding Catholic Charities social equity programs. Despite the name, no actual refugees seem to work here and none of the menu items seem inspired by the diverse cuisine of the refugee communities. Would be nice to see some diversity behind the counter.   My only other complaint is the endless Indie Pop playlist. While the volume and bpm are okay for working, it misses hip and lands somewhere between Tilly's and a Christian bookshop.   A worthy endeavor and great place for coffee and lunch if you are feeling cramped at Copper Star. As of yet, it doesn't manage to pull off the dual cafe/bar vibe like Lux can, and thus is not really a place I would want to go for a drink unless it was a business-casual beer with coworkers.",

You instantly feel like part of a family in this place. Great collection of local art, moody lighting, relaxing furniture, and chill beats makes it hard to want to ever leave The Refuge. Oh, and the coffee is great too, with several interesting combos. Try the Haboob!  I've had breakfast and lunch here and each time is was delicious. The pulled pork tacos are the best pork tacos I have had.  I also like that the beer and wine bar element is geared to a classy crowd without the classy prices. This makes for my top choice spot to take clients on business meetings. It's not formal or stuffy or fake like some Starbucks tend to come off as. You must visit The Refuge, especially since they have happy hour every day!",

The salmon Bruschetta was amazing and the Proscuitto and Gruyere ones were great...and for $3 for two they were well worth it. Also they are charity driven so its for a great cause. The menu also shows some $5 breakfast choices so we'll definitely try it in the morning too. Coffee was smooth, full bodied and delicious. Free wifi.

Dad added his own cream to the Eye Opener, and my Chai was piping hot, spicy and sweet. Hummus plate was gobbled down within minutes--- fresh, cold veggies (red peppers, cukes and carrots), nice pile of assorted olives and crumbled feta, several triangles of warm, soft pita- all with a generous crock of smooth, classic hummus- tahini flavor coming through without too much garlic.  Dad complained his \"large\" beverage seemed smaller than he expected, but that was the only complaint. Bathrooms were shiny-clean. Comfy seating throughout dining area with music playing at the perfect volume.  Art for sale on the walls and in a display case, apparently all by refugee artists living in the Phoenix area.   Parking is limited, which is typical for this part of town.  LOVE!",

It's more than a coffeehouse, as the name states, it's a cafe but with a coffeehouse vibe. I had black tea and 2 of the tapas, the olives and the grilled veggies. Everything was very tasty. I would like to go back in the evening and try some tapas with a beer or glass of wine.  It is an extremely comfy spot, lots of regular tables, hightop tables, bar stools around the bar area, and several big comfy stuffed chairs. Everything here looks VERY high quality. No ratty furniture here that's for sure. It was extremely clean. And all the art on the walls is worth a visit in itself.  I urge you to try the Refuge Cafe. It's a wonderful addition to the central Phoenix scene and a place I will be hanging out on a regular basis.",

They have a nice private meeting room in back and right now they have a local \"Promote Your Talent Showcase\" the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month featuring various local musicians and vocalists in an intimate setting.

All I ask is to be immediately acknowledged, receive friendly service, pay reasonable prices and enjoy it all in a clean environment; and this coffee shop/wine bar/ tasty delights hang out nailed it!   You'll be happy you checked it out. I'll be there tomorrow, no doubt about it!",

Get the breakfast burrito for lunch and the veggie wrap for dinner. They have one free refill on the iced tea. I don't actually drink coffee, so I can't comment on it.",

    "text": "I went to the Refuge yesterday after yoga for breakfast and coffee (sorry for my gross self coming in, haha) as part of my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw!). The people working here were nice enough and the prices were pretty standard. I got a latte and a bacon/egg/cheese/potato breakfast burrito. The 4 star review is really for the latte alone, the latte was very good...the burrito, on the other hand, was not very good at all. It was very large, too big for just me. It had a lot of egg in it compared to other ingredients and didn't have much flavor (was supposed to be southwestern, not sure what made it southwestern at all). It was served with some terrible, flavorless salsa... just overall not impressive. I would come back for coffee, but not for food.",

Very friendly young lady server.Tried American breakfast sandwich and egg, veggie, potato and cheese burrito. Both were freshly made and came out hot. They don't have pancakes and waffles or French toast.  Overall we enjoyed the quaint atmosphere and the food.",

    "text": "I like this cafe because it is a Starbucks alternative, and the environment is cozy and nice for studying or meeting friends. There's patio seating and a couple of couches, the bar and small tables.   I just wish they would put more thought into the veggie dishes besides salad and hummus. The veggie wrap seems to be whatever salad leftovers they have on hand, not very inspiring. I'd love it if vegetarian dishes were more than an afterthought, but something that chefs put their passionate dreams into!  I appreciate the unusual tea selections like lavender flavored tea, but I wish they'd offer the standards like chamomile and mint as well.  Supports Catholic Charities which aids refugee resettlement, and the walls feature changing displays of original art made by local refugees that the organization has helped.  In the end I go here because it's not Starbucks or Copper Star, and the food and drinks are decent, but I think this place has more potential!",

I ordered through UberEATS the other day and had some picky requests (because being pregnant will make you picky). They called me before sending my food out to make sure they could accommodate my requests. Then the food arrived! I got the Turkey Focaccia sandwich with side salad and OH MY GOODNESS it was all so good! So I ordered it for a second day in a row and will probably continue to order it as often as I can! Thank you!",

Well I was disappointed, not only was it practically empty the service was incredibly slow. I was walking out when the girl behind the counter finally came back to take my order after she slowly prepared a few drinks for the other customer. So I ordered some bruschetta (which was good, but over priced) and a bottle of wine yet my opinion still didn't chance.  Food was good, other than that I don't think I'd return.",

    "text": "I want so much to like this place because of  their mission to help newly settled refugees; unfortunately, my third try at breakfast with not a lot of luck is brining me to write this review. I'll just stick to my most recent visit which was earlier this week.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and the potato were not thoroughly cooked; some were raw. I ordered a cookie wrapped in plastic and it was not fresh; I'm guessing it was several days old but not advertised that way.  I sat at the bar area to eat my breakfast. I did not order coffee but nobody asked if I wanted water. In fact, the waitress disappeared and there was no way to get anyone's attention.   My suggestion is that the Refuge operate as any other restaurant or coffee shop. Customer service needs  to be improved. Why not check back on your customers and see if they need anything, similar to what you find in most other restaurants?  It's a popular place and others think the food is really good, so I could just be coming in on their off days.  I will try it next time for lunch and see what happens.",
