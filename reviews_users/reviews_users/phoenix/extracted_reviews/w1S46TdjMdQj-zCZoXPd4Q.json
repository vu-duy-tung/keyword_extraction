    "text": "The first time that I went into this place I thought that it was okay. I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \"Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!",

    "text": "My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends.   What we had: Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips  Lunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.  We got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it \"to go\" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said \"JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!\". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.    We ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!  I WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!",

    "text": "I travel frequently for work and look for local, good restaurants to try as opposed to the big chain places.  I found this joint on Yelp and it looked good and was close to my hotel so I gave it a try.  I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by Trish the friendly bartender.  She was vibrant and working hard, but took time to ask where I was from and to explain the menu with suggestions.  I decided on a cold beer while I mulled it over.  Then a guy walks in and sits down right beside me and starts chatting away.  He seemed like a regular here and a pretty cool guy.  I talked a little with him and asked him for his menu suggestions and come to find out, this guy was the \"Wally\" that owned the place. What a great character this guy was.  Anyhow, after another beer or two, I took their suggestion and ordered the day's Blue-Plate Special which was a Fried Chicken dinner for Monday's.  I was skeptical of ordering fried chicken when I was looking for something exciting, but based on the recommendations, I gave it a try. It was superb, crispy boneless breasts served with a salad, mashed potatoes, and a white-chocolate bread pudding desert.  All so tasty.  A little more chat with Wally and I found out he's a frequent traveler to Key West, FL (Another of my favorite places).  He goes down there every year for the Hemingway Days festival where he's a past winner of the Ernest Hemingway look-alike contest.  I will say, they didn't miss with this guy.",

The owner, Wally, and his son's run the 2 restaurants and treat everyone that walks in the door like an old friend--which I love.  Their grilled artichokes are to die for, and the pot roast is a must, especially on cold days. The Danish ribs are the best that I've had in the Valley--they fall off the bone and have a devine flavor. Friday lunch special is fish tacos and they are absolutely wonderful!

    "text": "So after an exhausting day the man and I decided we wanted to be waited on for dinner.  However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.  When we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.    Our waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.  When the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, \"I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?\"  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.    When our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.    Our server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "Can years of good service and food be off set by one HORRIBLE evening? Maybe... Went to Wally's with group of 5 people. The food was Wally's standard but the service was really bad. The server was rude, un-accommodating and slow. She forgot things (like a salad) and started invoking \"new rules\" about taking more than 3 credit cards for a group (even though equally split). She also lectured us on how she would apply the Wally's dicount card. It wasn't so much about the money, it was about the awful way she made us feel. If they want to discontine the discount cards, do it - don't come up with a bunch of arbitrary rules at the last minute... that just ruins things.  Wally's faces new competition in the neighborhood and if they want to stay in business they need to focus on service and keeping their long standing clients happy. The food is never the BEST or  WORST in the valley but the local feel and comfortable service are the big draw. Without that, there is no reason to go there.  Although we've eaten at Wally's at least once per week for more than 5 years, sadly, it will be quite some time before we return. Phoenix resturants compete in a service industry and when service is gone there is little reason to stick around- there are too many other, good options.  I'm giving my review a 2 rating because the food was OK. Based on service, I'd give it a zero! We're looking forward to Steak 44 and The Henry is wonderful. Wally, bye bye for now. Clean up your act and maybe we'll be back... maybe.",

Wally's has never disappointed me when I have been looking for a heavy, high fat, filling meal of American \"cuisine.\" This place is a great spot to visit if you have no regard for your health but high regard for your taste buds. It's leaps and bounds better than your typical pubs, serving good quality food rather than the apropos french fries and chicken fingers. Sure, they will serve you chicken fingers, but I much prefer the Bourbon Street Pasta, a cajun pasta with peppers, cream sauce, sausage, and chicken?  There is an upstairs, downstairs, and a nice patio, and they have a good staff. There is nothing groundbreaking about any aspect of this establishment, but you can always bet it will be a satisfying meal for anyone considering going to a bar for dinner.",

There is another location in the Gainey Ranch area and the menu is diverse with everything from great salads to meatloaf that won't disappoint.  It's a little pricey, but the quality helps offset the hit to your pocketbook.  Great wine list and creative cocktail menu to boot.",

I had the Grueryre Mac n Cheese, my wife had the salmon special, and my son had the spaghetti and meatballs kids meal.   Everything we ordered was best of its class.  The S'mac was heavenly, the salmon was a huge, moist, and expertly cooked.  They also had an impressive drink and food menu.  Plus it was laid back, and our server Shawn was top rate.  We'll be back, I cannot believe there isn't a line to get in.",

As expected, the place was definitely busy but we noticed the entire staff working together to make sure everyone was seated as soon as possible. There was a slight hiccup when someone else answered the call for our table. However, once we figured out what had happened we were seated immediately. The menu was fixed for St. Patrick's Day so we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for and appetizer; my husband got the shepherd's pie, my daughter had the chicken fingers, and I enjoyed the fish and chips. Everything came out quickly and hot. The food was delicious! We finished off with the bread pudding for dessert...heavenly!!! We will definitely be returning for another visit!",

I have to say that I was very impressed--our server was fantastic, and the manager and another server also stopped by our table to say hello and check on whether our food was enjoyable (which it was!).  Excellent comfort food in a cozy setting, with strong drinks! The only thing I'd like a little more of would be a more extensive mixed drink selection, but based on what they offer, they seem able to accommodate most typical drink requests. I will be back!",

When we received our appetizer and drinks and the gal told us the appetizer was on the house and again appologized for the delay in not getting to us sooner.  I don't have a problem with people making mistakes, we all do... what I care about as a customer is how you handle dealing with the mistske.  The staff was EXEMPLARY, appologized appropriately, made no BS excuses,  offered the free appetizer and extremely attentive service after that.  I ordered the prime rib sandwhich and my wife ordered the fish & chips.  Borh were very good!!  We were both delighted with the food and service.  Pleasantly pleased!",

Our server was Nico and he was super friendly, knowledgeable and one of the best servers we've had! I ordered the Mac n cheese with bacon and some funky (yet delicious) cheese. My mom got the prime rib dip, and my dad the cheeseburger. All SO good! I'm usually not one for prime rib unless it's in a salad but this was good.   I didn't drink, but my mom enjoyed a few (too many) cosmos. She said they were strong, but not rubbing alcohol strong. Prices were a little higher than most, but once you see how much food you get its not bad at all!   Definitely recommend and make sure you ask for Nico!",

    "text": "I found this place as I was parking to go to Flower Child on St. Patty's Day (as you may guess, my St. Patty's Day wasn't very exciting). I feel like I've thoroughly searched through the Arcadia area on Yelp, so I was surprised to find that the place had character and looked super inviting from the outside but yet it'd never come up in any of my searches.   As soon as I got home, I pulled up Wally's on Yelp and made a note to go there ASAP.  Wow! What a hidden gem within \"trendy\" Arcadia. The inside is quaint, casual, and inviting and outside there's seating on their patio that is adorned with bistro lights.   The staff was very friendly, and the food was excellent! We came in on the tail end of happy hour on a Sunday afternoon. I've attached the HH menu, but overall, some great deals on apps and beer. We went with wings and beer to start (excellent btw), and for dinner, I went with the reuben and my fiance went with the fish and chips (see pics). My reuben was okay but did not come out the traditional sandwich that I was craving..It was filled with ginormous pieces of brisket and was on something that resembled a po' boy bun..not Rye. Somewhat of a let down but not all was lost - I loved the shoestring fries as a side. My fiance loved the fish and chips - no complaints there!  Overall, I really loved this spot and can't wait to try it out again. Arcadia lacks this sort of casual bar/restaurant and though my fiance and I were probably the youngest in there (we sat next to a party of 8 who were 60+), the atmosphere and comfort food menu (i want to try out more items) will definitely bring us back in.",

My only issue is the limited amount of low tables.  When I go here with my parents it's not comfortable for them to be up high. There are only a few low tables inside and if it's busy you are out of luck.   Oh and Wally has some good wine!  Nice to see that at a bar.",

    "text": "Wow! My first trip to Wally's .... and I got to meet Wally! Neat-O!   Not only is he the bees knees he was hands on. I was, quite frankly, surprised by that. But more on that in a minute!  To frame my experience, I popped in on a Tuesday night during the dinner rush. One of our friends had hopped on over ASAP to nab a table. (Apparently this place is hopping. She was spot on!)  It's a really cute place that is friendly to all sorts of different folks.   If you want to watch the game? Sure! TV at the bar.  Feel like eating at the bar? Yep! Casual dining? Absolutely. Dinner date (where you want to impress)? YES.   I was (not on a date) but did see a number of couples engaged in serious conversation over wine. It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation.   For dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.  1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness! 2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window.   That being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.  Right. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \"regular\" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!  Ok, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E. Hemingway beard in FL.   [Drum Roll] They are 2013 crowned winners!  This is a great spot if you're popping in to AJ's. Loved it!",

Whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or don't want to be bothered with a hustle & bustle type place, Wally's it is!   Don't expect to order healthy here, their menu is more on the side of comfort food, that being said I've never had a bad meal. The portions are very generous, and the prices are reasonable. The service here is so welcoming, they treat you as if you've been coming here for years. They have great sangria and lots of decent beer on tap to go with their delicious food. My favorite dish so far has been the Prime Rib dip, it's fantastic and full of flavor, and they also have awesome fries (a mix of sweet potato and regular). This place is totally worth the cheat! I highly recommend Wally's, as it's a great local restaurant.",

After being sat, and greeted by our server, I could see they had a great customer service protocol as we had our drinks within 2 minutes.  I followed suit with the others and ordered their wings \"Wally Style\" and onion rings.  Usually with appetizers, it takes something pretty special to make me happy, but the wings were fantastic!  Crispy, flavorful, only the drums, and sauce on the side.  The onion rings were so good also, that I brought my girlfriend back that Friday to try their other food.  We started with the escargot, and then I had the bangers n' mash, and she had the fish & chips.  The entire meal was phenomenal, and the service was perfect.  Couldn't recommend more.

The food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day. I tried the french dip with prime rib for the first time and it was mighty good! I'm not a fan of liver and onions, but have been told that Wally's knows how to make it taste yummy. Great atmosphere, nice outside eating area, great menu selection. All around a good place.  We did have a strange occurance after our last visit. We went with friends and split the tab 50-50. While we were in the parking lot saying our goodbyes to our friends, the waiter came out & asked if everything was ok - if our experience was good. We all said yes, and he said he just wondered because when he gets a 10% tip, he'd like to know why. I know we gave him a nice tip - I have no idea what our friends tipped, but I thought it was incredibly rude that he would come out to question us! We've never had this experience at any eating establishment anywhere - I was really taken back. This is not indicitive of Wally's - but Wally, if you read this, please know this didn't set well with a \"Wally's Club\" member.",

I almost don't want to shout out the rave reviews too loudly because it's so cool and I don't want to attract any uncool-ness with rave reviews. But I do want to give props to a terrific establishment.  The interior is beautiful, I love the lofty feel over the bar. The crowd was a nice mix and good representation of our Arcadia hood. Not too rowdy, not too stiff. The ambiance was set up very well, with a little sports flair but casual dining as well away from TVs.  The waitstaff is attentive and genuine. The food was above-average pub fare with plenty of veg options for us meatless mongers. The only minus was that while the patio allows dogs, not ALL areas of the patio are dog friendly according to our host. So we had to sit away from the bulk of table and couldn't sit under the heaters (which also apparently couldn't be moved). It was 50* out and pretty chilly, so I'll plan for that next time.",

My son ordered the halibut special. The bill for a plate with some rice, green beans, and a piece of halibut was $26.95!!!!! I told Wally I thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his.

It ended up being there, but was such a small amount that you couldn't even taste it. Our daughters had the chicken fingers, which were pretty good, but also not anything phenomenal. Probably the best part of the meal were the sauces. The BBQ sauce on my burger (I got it \"rodeo style\" - with BBQ and onion strings) was really tasty, and the ranch that the chicken was served with was delicious. Tasted really fresh and homemade - they should bottle and sell that stuff! The burgers? Meh - I could take it or leave it. Certainly not worth a special out-of-your-way trip or anything.",

We took a chance on Wally's and were all astounded by the food quality and fantastic service we received on our visit. Everything was great! It was so good that we broke all road warrior tradition and actually went back to the same place to eat dinner the next three nights instead of exploring other options like we normally do! If you want great comfort food that is prepared elegantly and simply, check out Wally's. Some personal favorites of mine and our team: Pot Roast, The French Onion Soup is legendary, the fish was great (go figure considering it is in the middle of the desert), all the mac and cheese dishes were fantastic. The food servers are very accommodating, and the owner is always kind and willing to accomidate even quirky requests. Enjoy!",

My favorite menu items are as follows: 1) Cuban Panini 2) Frisco Burger 3) Meatloaf 4) Pot Roast 5) Spaghetti. The fact that Wally's can do all five of those things extremely well should tell you all you need to know.  There is something old school cool about a joint where the Proprietor is almost always present and Wally's is that place. He's the guy with the grey hair and beard who probably handed you your menu.

The greeting with the hostess was odd but when the lack of communication continued things just felt uncomfortable. Severs would come to the table to drop something off or fill water, after saying thank you they'd look at me and turn walking away without saying a word. We noticed that it wasn't just one ill trained associate but every person there refused to say 'your welcome' or even acknowledge my expression of appreciation. We came to the conclusion that they must literally train their employees this way because every person in the establishment treated us this way. We paid with separate checks, and to top it off they charged the wrong cards. Meaning they literally had to take the card out of the opposite bill fold and charge it to the wrong check.   They seem to cater more toward the older crowd, as staff seemed extremely friendly with these patrons. The fact that we are both under the age of 40 seemed to have contributed to our poor treatment.   I can assure you I will not be returning and I urge you to save yourself an awful experience and dine or drink somewhere else as well!",

Patient when our party simply couldn't decide what to eat from the awesome menu.   The food-where do I begin-it was all great! We started with wings. As suggested, we ordered them extra crispy with the sauce on the side as suggested and were not disappointed. Good flavor and perfectly cooked. The beer was ice cold. For entrees, it was definitely hard to decide. Their menu is varied with dishes that frankly l look great. We ordered bangers and mash, a prime rib dip sandwich, short ribs, and chicken Marsala. We all tasted everything and he food was all great. I also started with a cup of heir onion soup which was by far, the best I ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and good portions. We are already planning on going back. Great experience all around- a True gem.",

But short of that, this place is a sanctuary for the traveler or resident who wants great food, a cool drink, and a place that will remind them of good pubs from the east coast, downtown London, or, well, Phoenix. If you want a burger or something hand crafted and with the word 'infused' they have it along with reasonable prices, and welcome wait staff. They might be a little short on 'after dinner' drinks or desserts that require fire, but what REAL American does their drinking after dinner and eats flaming ice cream anyways? We will leave that to the French.   Do yourself and that visiting family member a favor and take yourself and them here. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "I really hate to give a terrible review to Wally's, but there is one area in which I draw the line; and that is when an owner/manager is disrespectful.  Our bicycling group has been going to Wally's every Tuesday for at least several years.  We usually are a group of 10-20 that call ahead to reserve an outside table EVERY WEEK.  The service tonight was horrible, and I do not blame the server AT ALL, I blame the owner/manager.    Quite a few members of our group have worked in the \"service industry\" in the past, and we understand and commiserate with the difficulties of serving large groups.  We were patient and polite with our server, even with missed orders and extremely slow service.   We always tip the server well, because it is our belief that it is the fault of the owners when they don't provide enough servers to adequately cover the patrons without feeling overworked.   However, the owner/manager, Matt, felt it necessary to come to our table as we were finishing up paying to chastise us. I don't know that I have ever had an owner come to the table to express what bad customers we had been.  He stood at our table and told us that \"this didn't work tonight,\" and that, in the future, \"we could all figure out our bill and anyone who didn't want to order food can come up to the bar to order and pay themselves.\"  He also went on to say that \"regular tables had to wait\" and \"that staff comes first.\"  What are we if not regular customers?  If I was a restaurant and bar owner who had a large group coming every week spending a significant amount of money, I would be grateful and welcoming.  I would make sure that I had enough wait staff to cover the busy happy hour time period, or HELP OUT MYSELF.  As I was waiting 20 minutes for my first beer, I looked in through the window and saw Matt standing at the register.  I turned to my husband and said, \"I wonder why he hasn't stepped up to help.\"    I know that you are a well-established restaurant with a regular clientele, and may not need to be welcoming towards our group.  However, please think about the message that you sent to a group of twenty regular customers, that we weren't deserving of good service or respect.  There are many other establishments that we can frequent in the area, I only hope that you listen to what I have said and respond.",

Although the tables are a little close together, it wasn't a problem because it wasn't packed when I went. The server was very attentive and she even left a carafe of diet coke on the table for us. We order the spinach as an appetizer and it was very tasty. We also split the mac and cheese and the mushroom and bleu cheese burger. The mac and cheese was amazing, I could've eaten it all day! The burger was cooked perfectly and I liked the mixed of regular fries with sweet potato fries and onion rings. I would definitely come back and recommend Wally's to my friends!",

OUTSTANDING! Never would have guessed they both would be so flavorful and just really really good. Thank you \"Check Please\" for reviewing Wally's. We agree with your fantastic review.

He then performed his tasks as if on auto pilot and not making us really feel welcomed.  When I asked him if he had any fresh brewed iced tea or if it came out of a gun behind the bar he had a dead look on his face then when I asked him if he had any sugar in the raw for the tea he just repeated the two types of teas that he had and told me \"all we have is what you see\" pointing to the sugar bowl ....this guy really didn't want to be here ....later I found a hair in my salad and I didn't even mention it feeling this guy wouldn't really care. When I asked him to remove my finished plate he blew right by me. Then when he came back to get it didn't bother asking me how I liked it even though I left a third of it on the plate. Would never go back here. By the way I should mention that my wife's burger was good but are the fries were uneventful I had a chicken Caesar salad and asked for replacement of balsamic vinaigrette which I got but for some reason the chef drenched it and I mean drenched it in balsamic dressing ...very disappointing for a $45.00 (PLUS TIP!) lunch for a burger, salad, two iced teas and Mr Sourpuss.",

There classic dishes out emphasized in green, so I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. The sauce was watery, the aspect of Cajun was lost, and the pasta was undercooked - I'm not a \"sender backer\", but this almost caused me to be caustic. The Pinot Grigio, which is an Italian, is lemony as Pledge - I don't recommend unless you've done the Tide Pod Challenge. My mate ordered the Wally burger and it was the size of a slider and even though he order all garnishment on the side, it was piled together like a tenement on the East end of London. If you like theme restaurants, subpar service, and just like to waste time and money - Wally's is the place.",

Before going I looked at the menu and found they had beef stroganoff which may even be rarer in restaurants than liver and onions. I settled for a bit of liver and got the stroganoff. I am pretty sure that was the best stroganoff I have had in a restaurant. Several folks tried the French Onion soup and liked it. Some of our party arrived early for our reservation, one on crutches, and they were seated promptly with out having to wait until we were all there. Even though they were packed the service was good and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. The only negative is between AJ's and several popular restaurants all on the same property parking is really hard to come by.",

He was rude and simply could not have cared less about our two top. We should have left! How this man is in hospitality is beyond me. We watched him w other patrons and he was great with his regulars . Moral of story, if you're not in the know of Wally get ready to be treated like crap. The food was ok, nothing great , noodles over cooked with the stroganoff dish. Service was fine. No reason to ever return. Oh and as we left, there were still empty tables.

Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge).

Any draft beer is $4, any app is $8 and any burger is $9. We ordered a Rodeo and a Frisco burger. I subbed the fries for a mixed green salad with a $1 addition. The quality of the food and service were both quite good. Our outdoor seating was pleasant with cooperating weather. There was some traffic noise from 44th Street, but not intrusive enough to hinder conversation. It is hard for me to characterize because it is unique. It isn't really a pub or a bar or a grill or a Mom and Pop diner, but perhaps best described as an amalgam of all four. It's an older establishment with the men's restroom used as a store room, but I would definitely recommend trying it.",

Ramon is a great bartender and also enjoy chatting with him. Their daily specials are always delicious, and so much food that two can usually split! plus comes with salad and dessert. Always a great option, and who doesn't want dessert?! Also, their pineapple infused vodka is one of my favorites to sip on! Infused in house and divine! When the weather is nice, the patio is also a good option.",

My husband ordered meatloaf & mashed potatoes with the veggies. I of course couldn't resist to take a few bites. So yummy!!

It didn't disappoint! We sat on the outdoor patio which was quiet and relaxing. We didn't see much of the inside of the restaurant so I can't comment on that. Our server was prompt and friendly. We both started with a cup of the caramelized vidalia onion and Guinness soup. I'm a lover of French onion soup, and this one was very good! The cheese was melted and stringy, but not goopy. There were plenty of onions and the top was bubbly and crusted, as it should be. For my main course, I had one of the s'macs. It was fantastic! If you like mac and cheese, definitely try one of the s'macs. I had the bread pudding for dessert. It wasn't the best bread pudding I've had, but it did the trick and was a very large portion. I would definitely return to Wally's again.",

It has great flavor and is covered in red wine au jus that is thick and almost gravy like! The pot roast is served with horseradish mashed potatoes. I'm a super big fan of horseradish so I also order an  side of horseradish to add to the potatoes and pot roast. It's also served with mixed veggies. I always think the veggies look so boring but they are actually really tasty. It's a mix of squash, broccoli, snap peas, green beans, carrots and peppers. They must be covered in butter because they taste way better than any veggie I ever make. The dish is $17 and it's a huge portion size. It so tasty that despite it's size, I'm always able to finish it all!",

I ordered a few peel and eat shrimp off of the happy hour menu and they were huge. The dipping sauce was amazing. My entree was the fish and chips which came with a generous portion of coke slaw. It all was delicious and they know how to make great fries. There is a patio with misting fans but it was cooler inside and comfortable. Prices were reasonable and lots of choices for happy hour. There's nothing here not to like and if I lived closer I'd be here all the time.",

If you've been to any BnG's in the Midwest you get that same feeling when you enter this place, like it had literally been plucked out of an Midwestern city, its cozy and feels like home.

The burgers are phenomenal and the desserts are all amazing. On my most recent visit we had the ginger apple pie and I almost forgot my name it was that good.

The front of house service is fine, but the food has been a big miss. I had fish and chips yesterday. It was super greasy and had no seasoning on the fish or in the batter which was way to thick. My cole slaw was super warm and I worry that someone will get sick from it. The French fries are really good but I can get good fries at McDonalds for $2.  My wife's Chop Chop Salad was made incorrectly twice. We complained the first time and then just gave up after that. They serve it in a cold bowl but the ingredients were a bit on the warm side. The chicken was rubbery and contained too much gristle.  We see the food execution get ignored so often with mature restaurants. I expect that is what is happening at Wally's.",

She got the dip sandwich & loved it, too.  Our server, Tom, was great.  Only downside to Wally's, it is in a nice shopping area.  I was unable to make it from the restaurant to my car without popping into a boutique & dropping $95 on a cute shirt.  This has happened before, but I'll continue visiting Wally whenever it's time to treat myself.  I've sampled everything from their meatball sub to the pot roast when I'm starving.  Always good food & service.  Thanks Wally!!",

Service was efficient, especially considering that it was a busy evening at the restaurant. It seems to me that this is one of the few establishments that does liver and onions right: perfectly cooked and seasoned, with minimal breading; it is served over mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables,the perfect sides for this dish. Seating was a bit tight but since this is a very popular restaurant, that is an unavoidable consequence of having lots of seats in a moderately sized, not huge, space. Parking is a bit of an issue at the front of the building, but additional spaces are available at the back.",

    "text": "My dynamic trio (me, fiancee and a friend), who always seem to frequent happy hour together at new places, checked out Wally's last night after a hair appointment at Moments Salon (a couple doors down).   We were seating right away at around 7pm, the place was packed (and LOUD) inside, so we opted for the patio, which turned out to be a bit warm until the misters kicked on at the pizza place across the sidewalk. Ha! But hey- sitting outside on October 1st in Phoenix is a gamble when it comes to the temperature...  I immediately got the feeling that we had unwittingly selected a restaurant full of delicious secrets only the locals know about- you know, one of those places the Food Network would check out. :) And yes, in my opinion, Wally's feels more like a restaurant than a pub, since we were seated immediately with menus and assigned a server wearing an actual apron.  After ordering pints of 4 Peaks Hefeweizen and Negra Modelo, we decided we weren't hungry enough for dinner and ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and Prawn Cocktail. I enjoyed the spin-art dip- a more generous portion than most places are serving for appetizers these days, standard flavors, served hot with perfectly salted tortilla chips. The Prawn Cocktail was nothing to write home about- average-sized shrimp and the cocktail sauce was, IMHO, seriously lacking in \"zest.\" Then again, I like a pretty kickin cocktail sauce, full of horseradish.  I held back on the \"stars\" since we didn't order meals, but Chad, our server, didn't bat an eye when we announced we weren't having dinner- just delivered the check quickly and politely.   I may up the \"stars\" when we go back- saw several menu items that looked enticing, including S'Macs- baked mac and cheese in several varieties, prime rib with goat cheese mashed potatoes and pan-seared halibut.   I'll be back... probably soon. Got another hair appointment, soon... :)",

Fish and Chips, just got a bite, but excellent with light breading and fresh fish, french fried white and sweet potato fries very tasty.  Dessert to die for, chocolate fudge cake.  The serving size was about a quarter of the entire cake, that my wife and I had a serving there and also a nice snack with our afternoon tea.  Strongly recommend.  Found the price no more expensive than any other for a good meal, the serving size is in line with price.  Will return, this time she won't have to drag me for sure.  A very lovely place.",

Friendly staff, sometimes Wally will actually greet you and get your drinks. Great menu with salads and typical pub style fare but also awesome salads. Always recommend you ask about the special of the day. There are some great ones.   I have not been for happy hour, but I will admit, the beer on tap and whiskey selection appear to be enough to satisfy any happy hour need.   By the way, Tuesday is Ta-tor Tot Tuesday & the sweat potato fries can make it a toss up. So check it out...you will be back.",

All burgers are $7.50 and normally the Bacon, Cheddar burger I received was $12, so it was a great deal. The fries were not as good as hyped, but it was a great burger and cooked perfectly well done. Well worth that price, maybe even $12 if you were in a burger craving mood. Now, my issue was not related to my food, but there was a  waiter who was grabbing straws from the dispenser by the top of the straw (where we drink from) and then putting it straight into unsuspecting folks drinks. I watched him do it three straight times and finally told him it was nasty and what the hell are you doing? He claimed that he normally does not grab the straws that style, but we all know he does and nobody pulls the wool over my eyes. Just a heads up. I would have mentioned it to the manager, but he was chewing gum like a cow while talking to customers, so the behavior must be trickling down from the top.",

I had a caprese salad - mozzarella was perfect as were the greens & balsamic dressing but the heriloom tomato was rock hard.  Nice idea but try to eat green tomato as one of the main features of a salad, not so good.  Shouldn't they atleast try to serve a partially ripened tomato?  I mean someone had to hack through this rock to put it on the plate.  Burger was good, nothing spectacular - accompanied by a side salad loaded with onions and some funky version of their bleu cheese dressing (lots of pepper).    Our waiter was so-so.  One of those guys that doesn't write anything down and doesn't remember anything you specially requested.  And forget about returning to the table to see how everything is after food was delivered.  We had to track HIM down.    Maybe this was an off day or perhaps I  ust ordered the wrong thing.  I might go back if I were in the area again - if only for the patio experience and I'm not particularly hungry.",

Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice.   Husband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it.   This is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY.

Crazy that in my 3 years in Phoenix, today was my first visit to Wally's, but it won't be my last!  I met 2 friends for lunch.  When we made our plans, they both suggested Wally's because of their convenient location and their 'caramelized vidalia onion & Guinness soup.'  I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I really wanted to try Wally's anyways, so that's what we did!  I was acknowledged upon walking in by Chip, the General Manager... he was extremely friendly and suggested we sit outside since It was a beautiful day.  He was right - sitting on the patio was perfect!  Service was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away... we started with the hot artichoke and spinach dip for the table... yum!  Good thing I worked out this morning, because I didn't feel quite as guilty enjoying this delicious appetizer - it was really tasty, and a generous portion too!  Of course, my friends Rachel and Lesley ordered the soup as planned - they both seemed to enjoy it.  I went with the Cobb salad.  It was your standard Cobb - with chicken, romaine and iceberg, diced tomato, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, avocado slices, chopped bacon, and balsamic dressing which I requested on the side.  It was good, but I think I was full from the chips and artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, so I couldn't finish it all.  Too full for dessert as well...  I'll have to return to Wally's for sure though - they had a pretty impressive bar menu with a ton of liquor, beer, and martinis too!  I noticed they had a kids menu, and some of my favorite desserts as well (hot apple pie and carrot cake).    Wally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers... I'll be back for more of that artichoke and spinach dip with a beer or 2 next time for sure!  See you there!",

My husband got the French dip and I stole a delicious bite. I want to order that next time. The sides were the best because they provide a mix of regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings! Perfection!",

We had a great waitress who was quick and friendly! I had the Home-Made Veggie Burger, and would recommend it, if you are into that kind of stuff. It was incredibly juicy, sticky and impossible to really eat like a regular burger. But, alas, I guess that is what you get! The flavor was spot on, just had to use the fork to get to it. I also really enjoyed the mixed fries! I had never had sweet potato fries, but I'm willing to try them again! Also, the mac 'n cheese plate looks amazing. Killer and heart-burning, but delicious. Kinda pricey, I thought, but I haven't been around the area too long yet.",

As I was in a pickle-y mood, I decided to get the Cuban sandwich.  This is maybe my favorite Cuban to date!  There were SPEARS of pickles, chipotle mayo, roasted pork loin, thick sliced ham and a grain mustard piled high on a ciabatta-type bread. It was reaaallll good. Came with mixed fries (half sweet potato) which was just what I wanted... I only ate half and the other half was my lunch today (still delicious when cold.) Wally's has 'Blue Plate Specials' that change every day. One of our party got the Iron Skillet Chicken which he ate all of... The special comes with dessert, white chocolate bread pudding, which I got to nibble on since he doesn't like raisins (double score!)  Overall, the food is really good and very fair priced. The wine was also priced really well and a bonus at half off.  Our server was prompt, made great recommendations and never let our glasses go empty.  I hope to get back here soon!!",

They have a great selection of $4 draft beers and $8 burgers (typically $11-$12) which is a great value compared to all of the other places in this area.  You don't even have to look too hard to find Wally which is cool considering the LGO and Fox takeover that is going on in the area (yikes!).    Grassroots Kitchen is also pretty legit and I believe Wally's son runs it.  It's near 20th Street and Camelback and worth checking out as well.",

It was a nice evening so we sat outside (coming from the snow we had this winter, sitting outside was something I didn't think would ever happen again).    The menu was pretty extensive, I think anyone in your party should be able to find something to please them.  Usually I would expect with such a large menu the food would be just okay.  But not this place, at least not as far as the burgers.  I ordered the buttons and bleu burger and my boyfriend ordered bacon cheddar burger.  We both ordered our burgers medium rare and they were cooked perfectly!  There was a ton of mushrooms and bleu cheese on mine and lots of bacon and cheddar on his.  So much so, that he was able to share some bacon with me.    The burgers came with a mixture of regular fries and sweet potato fries (my favorite).  I loved the idea of mixing them so you don't have to decide on one or the other.    Overall, the food was delicious, the prices were fair (especially for amount of food) and outside sitting was perfect!  If ever in Phoenix again, I will definitely go back to this place.",

It was pretty busy when we went and the entrance was very crowded and uncomfortable to wait in but once we got to our table everything got better. Service was perfect and everyone who works there from the hostess to the bussers were very warm and friendly. Started with the spinach artichoke dip- sooo good. I ordered the chicken picatta hesitantly because I never order chicken out (so easy to make at home) but holy cow definitely a chicken dish I will return for. The sauce was so scrumptious and the horseradish mashed potatoes went nicely as well. Only complaint is that the vegetables seemed previously frozen. Finished with the bread pudding which we gobbled up in seconds. We spent more money than we thought we would at a casual neighborhood spot but quality was consistent in everything we ordered and overall was worth it. Looking forward to returning.",
