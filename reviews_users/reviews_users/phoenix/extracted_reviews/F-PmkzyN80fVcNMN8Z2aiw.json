Even the bussers were nasty. By the way we asked Jack for chips and salsa 5 times got em when we were done eating. If you like high prices, medlocre food, small portions and lousy service this restaurant is for you.",

What I liked: atmosphere, free piping hot corn bread served out of a skillet, and its been so long I remember liking the flavor of the food (but don't remember what my party ate).  What I disliked: \"Mexican\" restaurants charging for chips and salsa (see corn bread comment above, though), their prices were definitely on the higher side, and not knowing who was serving me also bothered me.   In my opinion, this is a very pricey \"Mexican\" restaurant. Though I may go back again, will I? Probably not a good sign if I doubt my self returning here. There are plenty of Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants in Arizona for me to go to, before this one pops in my radar again.",

It's certainly an upgrade from somewhere like On The Border in terms of style and quality but it's still usually always located in a strip mall and I'm pretty sure both of our servers on two separate occasions were stoned.  The good things: awesome happy hour, awesome guacamole, really great green chili served with tortillas and the chicken pecan salad. The bad things: everything else. Every other salad was terrible. The catfish tacos - really terrible. The corn bread they serve up free of charge is ok, but anything free of charge is considered ok in my book.  Overall, it's not bad, really. If you just want a well priced margarita with your buddies on a nice patio, this is your place.  But if you're looking for somewhere special to go with people in town or on a date, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Arizona + Texas + Louisiana = Great flavors of Z'Tejas   This our overall favorite restaurant in AZ. It's out go-to place for after work happy hour and it's also where we bring out-of-town visitors. Z'Tejas is NOT Mexican food. Rather it combines the flavors of the American Southwest in a bold, fresh, imaginative way.   The frozen margaritas are the best in town. Jimmy Buffet would approve. What they lack in size, they more than make up for in strength. These babies pack a punch. Maybe that's why you have to get management's permission to have more than three?   Z is near our house and serve a variety of great food, that's why it's one of our fave places. They sent me a $10 off coupon for my bday. Me and hubby went there for happy hour, had three killer appetizers (shrimp sausage dumplings, green pork chili, and Leo Street tenderloin tacos). Hubby had a margarita (voted PHX best) and I had a diet coke (trying to diet, as if). Total bill with tax and tip was under $19. Of course, bday coupon helped, but still...no wonder this is one our favorite places for food, drink, and value.",

We also had a regular margarita at the table which was another small glass packed with ice.  One sip and it was the opposite problem all tequila.  The other margarita was a fruit one.. you know the rest of the story on this one. Manager never came by once to see how everything was. If they had, we would of requested new margaritas.  The food was decent, however for $168 on a Sunday afternoon for such absurd margaritas and slow service (not blaming server, I think she had the whole restaurant) and small plates of food wasn't something I would recommend to anyone.  Very disappointing. Was really looking forward to trying your unique restaurant out.",

    "text": "Meh....   Let's start with the positives:  Our server was friendly and awesome.  The cornbread served in the cast iron pan was rustic and fresh (piping hot from the oven).  The food presentation was pretty and appealing.  The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.  It probably isn't usually this crazy.  The prices are middle of the road.  The negatives:  Too bad the food did not taste as good as it looked.  Everything seemed to need some salt and they used the same slaw in the ahi bites appetizer as in the fish tacos I ordered.  This homogenous taste experience left much to be desired.  Why they serve fish tacos rolled in a gummy flour tortilla is a mystery.  If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.  The gummy flour tortilla stuck to my teeth and top of my mouth.   I ate 2 pieces this way and eventually just took my fork and gutted the two remaining pieces and the experience was much better.  I guess I am used to real Mexican food and enjoy good Cali-Mex and Tex-Mex.  However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.  I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.  My sister chose this restaurant.  I definitely will not return on my own volition.",

I thought it was all pretty mild with the artichoke hearts being the only thing that stood out.  The sweet potatoes were a bit too hard for my liking so not sure if that is how they should be or they were just undercooked - crunchy.

We both order the enchiladas, one with chicken and one with beef. Both were ok but we found them to be flat in flavor and under seasoned. The rice and black beans were well prepared but could not carry the one note enchiladas.

The waitress took our food order and disappeared for at least 20 minutes.  Then our food showed up- the entree we were going to split because we were having the nachos... So the waitress stops by and asks if everything looks ok and I said \"well the nachos never came so make sure we aren't charged for them\".. She gives me a blank stare and says \"nachos?\"... No apology... And we were never offered anything to make up for it (i.e. Free dessert, take off a charge on our bill...?).  Our entree was cold- but dinner was ruined anyway.

I had forgotten how much I liked the oven fresh cornbread that leads off the meal. I ordered the smothered chicken burrito. It carried some serious heat, which I loved, but I suspect it was more than the kitchen intended. Others in my party opted to share three happy hour appetizer specials. They enjoyed all three.  Our table was located within earshot of the bar. Tuesday?!? night and happy hour was in full swing. Volume increased as the night progressed and drinks multiplied, gradually making conversation at our table a bit challenging. Didn't ruin the meal, but surely didn't add to it either. Obviously, they still have a great happy hour at Z'Tejas. I'd recommend a table well away from that area. Or perhaps just join in the drinking.",

However the Scottsdale location not so good. I took my wife and our two kids for Mother's Day dinner and to say it was a joke doesn't even cover it. It took forever to get drinks when they weren't busy. Most of our food was cold, we ask for more cornbread 3 * and got none. On top of it our waitress said that are appetizer is half price and drinks are $3 off because of happy hour and we were charged full price for everything. Now I could understand if the place was busy, but it was not. Everyone around us got there after us and we served before us. And I can say that we are the most polite group that any server could have in her section. It's been a long time since we were there and it'll be a longer time before we go back.",

I had 2 margaritas. They are small but good. I was not offered a third. I was not driving. I was eating a snack. So, if you don't ask me, you miss out on the sale. Anyway, do they have a 2 marg limit? I can probably handle 3 in 3 hours, with a snack and a chat with friends.",

Oh...  NO MORE COMPLEMENTARY CORNBREAD.  They're masking it with \"we donate proceeds to ...\" And next they'll give 50% of the proceeds somewhere else...  This is not a fine dining restaurant. It's a happy hour with a bar.  If you want to attract a crowd or earn a star, change the menu and your style of serving.   Wow. Disappointed returning customers and Won't be back.

Was pretty annoyed as we wanted our dinner after our app to enjoy it hot.  The server even noticed we had no room and didn't say a word (like sorry that came out so fast!).  Actually never came back to refill drinks.  Waited a decade, or so it seemed for her to get a check, forget dessert at this point.  then i swear i told my husband she left with my debit card bc she wasn't coming back.  Had to get a manager and still took forever.  He didn't even seem to care!  A simple I'm sorry goes a long way.  Really disappointed in the bad service and just not caring at this location.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying, that I have rarely written a bad review and I have never complained at a restaurant before. The whole experience was unpleasant from beginning to end. Our server, Kristyl, was perhaps new, but that was unclear. We were seated at a table and with no utensils. Cornbread was brought out after 25 minutes and yet we still had no utensils or plates and it took another 10 minutes to get the server to bring them. Never once did an apology come out of her mouth. We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water. Our food order came out 40 minutes after placing the order with absolutely no apology. This is 15 minutes after we were told they no longer had rice. What southwestern restaurant runs out of rice? Then an assumption was made that my sister would want vegetables with her order so that was brought out without even asking if if she'd prefer that or salad.  We said something to the manager, Hailey, about the long wait and her response was apologetic yet making an excuse that this is not what the ticket time stated.  After the complaint the server was even considerably colder in her demeanor. The food itself is subpar and completely overpriced with no creativity whatsoever. We finally requested the check and realized they took $20 off the bill for the long wait time, which is more than fair and much appreciated. However, the manager never came back to tell us that is what she was doing for us and apologize again.  The server never apologized and told us about the resolution.   I would never eat here again.  This place has been around for too long and has overinflated opinion of itself.  There are much better places to eat which have superior food, service and price.",

I had to ask our server Stephanie her name (not giving their name is a particular pet peeve of mine,) but she quickly warmed up and gave us individual attention.  She recommended the renowned margaritas, and my wife tried the Paradise Rita and I tried the Chambord Rita.  Both were delicious and refreshing and $1 off due to happy hour.  We had also noticed that wine bottles were half price on Tuesday nights on the way in, and we sprung for the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, and it was crisp and fruity in spite of being a screw top.  For our free appetizer, we got the table side guac, and Stephanie mixed it up at the table, but I noticed she did not use all of the pre-measured salt and pepper and it could have used it.  Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.  As Stephanie was packing up the leftovers for us, two slices of cornbread baptized the table next door, and she brought us a whole cornbread in its place (packed safely we assume in the kitchen!). Overall a great dining experience and we would visit again!",

I ate there yesterday at one of the chain's generic locations and was very disappointed. The place wreaks of a casual dinning chain. Gone is the cutting edge southwest cuisine that made it great. If you want a southwest style Marie Callender's by all means give it a try.",

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews on Yelp and in other places, I came here expecting margaritas that would make my heart sing Spanish love songs, even though I don't know Spanish.  We chose Cinco de Mayo for our visit, since I wanted an excellent margarita, and we both ordered the 6th st. \"award-winning\" margarita as a starting place.    First, it was tiny.  Second, it had the quality of so many restaurant margaritas, and how else can I describe it other than floor cleaner?  You know, the kind they used to wax the terrazzo floors of your high school cafeteria with.  Tasted like that.  Good margaritas are so easy to make, but almost no one gets them right because they either use crappy bulk mixes or that garbage that comes out of a giant steel container through a gun.  Disappointing.  I was hoping the food would redeem the lousy margarita, but alas, I found no redemption here.  In a word, or three, it was really, really mediocre.  We ordered the chips and salsa, with the three house salsas, and it was decent, but no better than the free stuff you get at most any cheap Mexican restaurant.  Nothing fantastic, but decent.  The cornbread was good, but seemed like a gimmick.  My wife's salad was below average.  Funny, but they mix your salad for you at tableside, which seems odd unless you are at a four-star restaurant from 1980 and they are mixing your Caesar salad in a giant stainless bowl before delivering your Steak Tartare with a side of gout.  I ordered the diablo pasta, thinking it would light my fire and cause me to forget the lousy margarita and order a more expensive one, but el Diablo was nowhere to be found.  Instead, el Diablo sent his less well-known American cousin, Senor Bland.  It wasn't hot in any way, shape or form and in fact didn't taste like anything besides milkfat pretending to be a sauce of some kind.  I ate about three bites and gave up because it was so incredibly tasteless.  The service was good, and I liked both the hostess and our waitress.  I did see a couple at the table next to us walk out because they didn't feel they were being attended to fast enough, but I thought they were just being jerks.    The decor looks as though they bought out one of those stores that sells model home furniture and called it a day, but then most of the houses in Phoenix look like this, so I can't fault them too much for trying to make their clientele feel at home.  This restaurant is mostly for people who want to pretend they like southwestern/Mexican food, but think Chili's is not authentic enough (by the way, Chili's has better margaritas, and that's sad).  Needless to say, I won't be going back.  I can go to the Los Taquitos near my house and eat authentic food and drink a margarita with fresh-squeezed lime juice for half the price, and with way more than twice the taste.",

    "text": "I'll start by reminding anyone who reads this that I am a VERY picky person as you can see by my reviews! I took a friend here for Sunday brunch for her birthday....I chose Z'Tejas because they have a \"bloody mary\" bar, and I do love my Sunday morning Bloody Mary! We were immediately greeted and seated by a friendly hostess and joined promptly by our server \"Bubba\". I normally dont mention names as not to make anyone feel bad....but with Bubba there's nothing to feel bad about. He greeted us with a super smile and his outgoing personality which made us feel at home instantly! We started, of course, to the bloody mary bar which offered a large variety of hot sauces and condiments.....although I enjoy my bloody marys I really dont know how to make a good one, but with the assistance of several employees who were happy to help, I enjoyed a darn good drink! My problem with the condiments was that most of it looked dried out ex: carrots, celery and pickles. While enjoying our drinks Bubba came to our table to make us the guacamole we ordered, he showed us each ingredient before adding it and a few minutes later we were digging into our guac and chips...yummmmm We shared a \"shrimp omelete\" which had baby shrimp,goat cheese and was very good.  We couldnt decided on the corn bread, morning glory muffin or the fresh fruit, so Bubba, being the excellent server he is brought all 3. The cornbread was fluffy and not at all crumbly which I did not prefer, but it really is just a matter of taste. The omelette came with little potatoe chunks that were well seasoned. Here comes the Con (the 2nd reason they lost points)....we had just started with our appetizer of guac and chips when they came to the table with the main course. We would have preferred to enjoy what was already on the table before bringing more, especially because by the time we got around to the omelette it was not hot. They brought my friend an \"on the house\" birthday desert which was a browine type mixture baked as a pie with a dab of whipped cream on top. The brownie pie is a \"MUST TRY\", it was sweet and decedant and sinful and we loved it! We never had to ask for anything as Bubba visited us frequently to check on things. The atmosphere is comfortable, big and airy and a great place to enjoy a meal or just a cocktail. We WILL be back and I do reccomend you give it a try....and dont forget to ask for \"BUBBA\"... In the meantime.....  Bon' Appetite",

Call me cheap, but 50 cents?  I mean....c'mon!  The appetizers were yummy.  We especially liked the catfish tacos and the quesadilla.  The cornbread was delicious, as well (oh, sweet, sweet carbs....)  I had heard friends RAVE about the Chambord Margaritas and let me say, mine was STRONG.  I can see why they cut you off at 3.

I have also ordered food to go several times and it is always packaged perfectly neat, and they give you a generous portion of their fresh corn bread.

However, I'm a beer man, and there are only about 5 choices here, which are a whopping 50 cents off during happy hour. When my waitress first told me that, I just stood there and looked at her, waiting for her to tell me that she was just kidding. She didn't.   Of all the things I have eaten here, probably the most memorable was the pulled pork nachos which I just had yesterday. I was expecting a plate piled high, but to my surprise they brought out the plate and there were.... 6.  Six nacho chips, arranged in a circle on my plate.  I felt pretty cheated at first.  However, they were pretty big chips... and they were loaded with heaping helpings of pulled pork which was really pretty good.  Often I think this place tries to be too fancy with their food, but these were just mounds of bbq goodness. Throw a little guac on top (a combo I never thought of trying) and I was extremely satisfied. Of course the 3 beers (which I saved 50 cents on - each) helped out with that.  So minus one star for the happy hour specials, lack of beer choices,  and the pretentiousness, and the rest is all good.",

The patio was nice and sunny so it was a treat to have some warm weather after this horrid Atlanta winter. After arriving we found out that it was tequila Tuesday with lots of drink specials. For food we went with the tableside guac to share and the southwestern pesto pasta with shrimp.

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  The Happy Hour here is outstanding!  I've come here a few times after work with friends on Friday nights and the place is packed and lively. I highly recommend you give it a try.   Yes, I know it's a chain; but you're in for a treat when you come here.  And people just don't leave because it's 7pm and HH is over, some stay till closing.  LOL  AMBIANCE/MOOD: The buzz and atmosphere on a Friday night is great. It's mostly standing room only, but there are a few bar stools that open from time to time.  Somewhat modern, somewhat eclectic (see photo of the mounted Cadillac bumper), but very relaxed and friendly. The first thing you'll noticed are the three flat screen, but no one is watching. LOL.   Everyone is just enjoying each other's conversation, whether they're with your group or not. Nice.   MENU: I've taken several photos of the HH menu, but it's $5 and $6 for most items. The standouts are the Mexican Street Tacos (addicting and a must) and the $5.00 Chambord Margaritas (they're tasty and strong).  I've also developed a craving for their Roasted Salsa and cheese Queso.   SERVICE: If the service wasn't good...  well... you would still would come for the food, but it's very good with all the servers working together.   The bar staff also seems to just stand in front of their frozen slushy/Margarita machine all night. LOL  They keep making one drink after another. There's a fluidness to how everyone is just hustling. Nice!  FOOD: I've mentioned the Chambord Margaritas, Street Tacos and Queso, are each good starting points.   PRICES: Very inexpensive. Expect to pay $20-25 depending on how hungry you are and how addictive you become to their Margaritas. LOL!!  So Four Stars and \"yes, we're a Fan.\"   Enjoy!",

This is the second time this has happened. Guess it's my fault for ordering it again. The guacamole is the most expensive part of the trio so forgetting it twice feels intentional.  Ordered an extra side of sour cream, and when I put it on my food....it was whipped cream.   The food is great, and it's a good experience in person, but my Postmates orders have been consistently screwed up. Such a bummer.",

Ingredients added were added with ungloved fingers.  Bread was delivered with a bowl on top of it that held butter.  Enchiladas were more of a lasagna and not enchiladas.  No communication about this. Chicken street tacos were slightly warm when delivered.  To top this off, the waitress had very low jeans that showed too much (if you get my drift).  This place was empty on a Sunday night and now I know why....",

I was sad to see that on a Saturday eve, half of the restaurant was empty.  I used to come here years ago when I was in town and I remember it being higher end, busy and delicious.  Now, it seems like it was bought by someone else or it went too corporate and the quality went down.  Guac was grainy, salsa was too sweet, tortillas weren't yummy fresh like you'd expect in this area.  The Chile relleno had decent flavoring and sauce but the pepper itself wasn't cooked enough. As if they broiled a lump of meat and laid a half cooked pepper on top. The beans and rice were just ok.  In the future, I will probably just order the green chile for take out.",

    "text": "Usually I would write great things about Z'tejas on Tatum, however, I am sad to say this was the most disappointing experience ever. We sit at the Bar after 5 pm on a Saturday and specifically ask is it happy hour. The waitress smiles says yes and places an  happy hour menu in front of us. After having a drinks, soup and a salad, we asked for a check and there no happy hour prices listed. So we ask the bartender to adjust our bill- which was $61.00 and he tells us happy hour is 3 to 5 on Saturday. Well great seems like the staff doesn't even know when happy hour is supposed to take place. Perhaps, there is a reason that they closed 60% of their restaurants. The bartender was kind and gave us free appetizer cards which required us to buy an entree, but we aren't coming back. Feels like an end to a great era.",

    "text": "This location is extremely 'group friendly.'  I just made up that term, but it's True... I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.  I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!  After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!  I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!  Word of caution: be careful with the chambord margaritas - they dangerously good!",

They have a wonderful happy hour that is honored throughout the whole restaurant but the thing that keeps me coming back are the tenderloin street tacos. DELISH. not to mention their chips and salsa!   one thing I dislike is that you have to buy their chips and salsa its not complimentary and its not exactly cheap. They do however redeem themselves with the complimentary skillet cornbread that is absolutely delicious. This is the one restaurant I cannot stay away from as those damn street tacos keep calling my name. They also have a pretty mean frozen margaritas that can be stiffened up with patron floats!",

    "text": "It all started two weeks ago when I fell asleep rather early on a work night.  I usually have pretty vivid dreams, but the most unusual thing about this dream was that it was about food, specifically, peach cobbler.  Everywhere I went in this dream there seemed to be an imperative to eat peach cobbler...  I jumped from place to place all over the world enjoying the different types of cobbler.  Upon awakening I was disappointed that it was just a dream.  Yesterday, Sunday 9/4/16 me and a few friends decided to grab some dinner at Z'Tejas.  We frequent this particular establishing because of the fine margarita selection and the delicious dip trio.  Upon entering this fine Sunday evening, the board with the specials listed those 5 magical words I had been anticipating for the prior two weeks, \"Today's dessert special: Peach cobbler.\". Butterflies immediately filled my stomach in anxious excitement for I knew that this was the cobbler I had been waiting for.  The libations of the evening were to be several rounds of Dos Equis lager...  The flavor was crisp and the carbonation was satisfactory.  It was the perfect beer after a long day in the Arizona heat.  For our appetizer we requested the Tejas trio, which came with 3 professionally sized portions of dip and a basket of tortilla chips.  The melted queso, my favorite, was delightful as always.  As were the salsa and guacamole, but my mind at this point was only focused on one thing, the peach cobbler at the end of the tunnel.  For my entree I enjoyed the chicken fajitas.  They were well seasoned and sauteed with peppers and onions.  The tortillas were nice and warm, and accompanying sides were bountiful.  I devoured the fajitas knowing that in a few short minutes the waitress would come by to receive my peach cobbler order.  Upon finishing my guests were prepared to get the check and leave, but I explained to them how important it was that I have this peach cobbler and they understood.  After a few short minutes the cobbler came out in a hot skillet similar to my fajitas earlier.  There it was, almost exactly as I had imagined one if the cobblers in my dreams.  The perfectly shaped scoop of ice cream majestically topped the perfect display of crumbs and luscious peaches.  The waitress asked if we would need more than one spoon but I assures him i would be handling this one on my own.  I jubilantly gashed the ice cream with the spoon scooping the the brilliantly yellow peaches up on the way into my mouth.  It was everything I was waiting for and more.  The crumble was perfect, not too toasty, the right amount of sweet, and the perfect amount of crunch.  Each bite was devoured with enthusiasm.  The peach danced across my tongue accented by the slightly melted ice cream with the crunchy topping.  All in all it may have been the best peach cobbler I have ever experienced.  For I think I must retire my desire for peach cobbler going into the future as I have reached the pinnacle of peach cobbler existence.  TLDR:. Peach cobbler was fucking phenomenal.",

First of all, there were like five  tables there on a Saturday night, and the live music was so horrendous that everyone was squished up against the far wall of the restaurant away from the band. And I actually saw two different parties come in and ask the hostess to be seated away from the music! It was so so bad--and so loud?! I'm a 28-year-old music lover btw... just so you don't think it's because I'm old!  The food was nothing like it used to be. Everything is grossly sweet--from the margaritas to the salad dressings, to the sauces... it was weird. And nothing came out hot?? The cornbread and my enchiladas were both lukewarm at best. Just gross.  Our server was actually very nice but the manager had a terrible attitude, which really left a bad taste in my mouth, if the food hadn't done so already.  Quite frankly, I'll never go back.",

I particularly love their cheese dip in their nacho cheese and chip appetizer.  Warm, creamy, and cheesy along with some guacamole pop; great start to the night and I would totally recommend.  They're known for their margaritas, but I felt like a beer so didn't have a chance, but definitely next time!    For entrees my friend and I shot for the Salmon salad, fajitas, and for myself I ordered the Smothered Chicken Burrito.  I rather enjoyed my burrito filled with rice, chicken, cheese, and doused with warm red chile sauce.    However, the love I give here is because of their service.  We had a party of 11 and they did their best to accommodate us on a busy night; even having a server come out to the front of the building taking our drink orders.  Service did not slack all night and that's what I appreciate; plus they were knowledgeable about their food.  I've worked in the food industry all my life and in the end there's never excuses just get it right and Z'Tejas Paradise Valley did! - Enjoy!",

One of our water glasses was dirty and had lipstick all over it which was a huge turnoff. We were so excited to dive into the trio and tortilla soup but it was pretty awful. The chips were stale and the soup tasted like it was from a can. My husband ordered the steak quesadilla, definitely not impressed. It was really tasteless. So sad to give this place two starts, hopefully they improve!",

Something has really changed over the past year. I've given it a few chances after back-to-back bad experiences and even spoke with the GM on 2 occasions to give constructive criticism. Unfortunately, I think their greatness has just come to an end. Bad service and horrible food is now a pattern. I still have hope but will not be back to see.  *My most recent visits have only been to the Tatum/Shea location",

    "text": "Attn: ZTejas Corporate - and in particular Gary Manley, Mike Pottorff, and Michael Stone, partners in Cornbread Ventures (I looked you up, and perhaps you care???), who purchased ZTejas to bring it out of bankruptcy. Extremely disappointing experience at ZTejas. Our server was great.   But your manager at Tatum & Shea (his name is also Michael) doesn't know how to be a manager or how to retain customers. We've been patrons of Ztejas since 1997, when we first at at Fashion Square. We live near the Tatum and Shea location.   At one time, we ate frequently at ZTejas, but we had been disappointed in the food during our last few visits. We were enticed to return by your ad in a local magazine that said, \"Mention this ad\" for a 30% discount. I convinced my hesitant husband to give them another chance.   We \"mentioned the ad\" to our server before ordering. Sadly, the food was not good - the fish tacos, formerly one of our fav dishes, were thin and sugary - not like the fleshy and delicious tacos we'd had dozens of times prior at ZTejas. The salad was skimpy and the dressings were too sweet. The mushroom enchiladas were tasty but also much smaller than in the past. BUT IT WAS THE THOUGHTLESS MANAGER, Michael, who ultimately lost our business. Ironically, Michael told us they were trying to \"rebuild the business.\" But when we mentioned the ad discount offer, he said we needed to bring the ad with us. We said: If it says \"MENTION THIS AD\" in large letters - and not \"BRING THIS AD\" - we take you at your word. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING. STAND BY YOUR WORD. Michael did not give us the discount. We tipped generously to our lovely server, but you've lost a customer that you might have brought back. Was that the point of your advert offer? FYI, we're \"foodies\" who eat out three to four times a week. Between the lowered food quality and the incompetent management, we're gone.",

We also had the shrimp tostadas, this was not bad, but neither exceptional.  It was just competent.  The prices during happy hour are great.  The service was not that great, though.  When we got there, we sat at the bar.  There were a couple of servers/bartenders? at the end having a conversation.  I kept making eye contact and they saw us, but kept going on with their talk.  Finally the other bartender who was there got to us.  All in all, this is a good place to go when you have some time to kill during happy hour. We used to come here a ton a few years ago.  I guess when you are single this is one of the spots to hit.",

Drinks are strong, I couldnt wrap my head around the vodka-diet coke they brought me, I think I would have left drunk, so I didn't touch it, but maybe I'm a weenie. If strong drinks are your thing...then have at it. Definitely try the table-side guac (YUM!). If youre looking for a healthy option, they have roasted veggie tacos on the new menu.

I think this place is what Chilis wants to be. The food was very good, and reasonably priced. The drink we got (a hibiscus margarita) was as good as the other reviews claim - $ 8 for about a 4 oz drink. The cornbread before the meal was delicious (one of the highlights) and all of our meals were quite good. Entrees were in the $11-25 range. I'm not super excited about it, it's definitely got that chain vibe, but I have no complaints. Oh, and this location has a rather nice patio, and is right next to a TCBY =)",

Living only a mile from the Phoenix Open, there wasn't a place around with less than a 90 minute wait and some friends and I were starving. One friend reminded us of Z's and they got us in for a table of 7 quickly. No apps were needed as we devoured the cornbread. Even my little baby boy gobbled some up, too!  I got the wild mushroom enchailada and a pomogrante margarita. DE-LISH! I devoured it all! Then, I ordered margarita numbero dos. For someone who doesn't consume a lot of alcohol, I became Miss Chatty Cathy. But, I like this place a lot. There can be a lot of people there, but you don't feel crowded because the seating is nicely spaced. I've even sat at the bar seating before and never felt like anyone was in my personal space.

The 1/2 price bottles of wine on Monday and Tuesdays was a nice touch for the holiday season and the service was generally good. We were left at the bar once for quite some time with no server in sight. Our server said something was going on in the restaurant but didn't elaborate. I have to say that I wasn't a big fan of the table side guacamole. It was a cool looking set up, but the flavors were lacking a bit. I had the Mushroom Enchiladas, gluten free style. I really don't get how it differed from the main menu Mushroom Enchiladas and the server couldn't seem to explain this either, but the enchiladas were tasty and I loved the mango salsa. My brother had the seafood enchiladas. I tried a bite and was really disappointed.  The fish tasted fishy which means it probably wasn't really fresh. He didn't care for it either. Everyone at our table raved about the cornbread served in a small skillet at the table but I did not try that. I will probably check out a new place when I come back but it isn't a bad meal and, if you drink enough wine, who would care anyway?",

To my surprise, the manager walked over and thanked me for my patronage. Encouraged me to come back and then kindly offered to cover the bill on my behalf.

We checked open table, saw that Z'Tejas still had some openings, and since we had been told by some friends that their food was excellent we decided to make a reservation.  Positives: the food really was great! We loved the chips & salsa appetizer we chose (even though I do find it a little silly that you have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant), loved the complimentary hot cornbread in a skillet, and loved our entrees as well (I got the fajitas, he got the chicken enchiladas). The food was almost better than great, it was exactly what we would have wanted and I find myself already craving it again!  Negatives: It took us fifteen solid minutes to even get a waitress to our table, which I would totally understand if it was super busy, but it wasn't. We were actually surprised at how many open tables we saw given that it was Valentine's Day, and yet we still had to wait. Our waitress was also just not that great once she arrived. She didn't seem to know much about the food or drinks, and seemed a bit flighty.We were also disappointed by the drinks we received. My fiance ordered a Dos Equis draft and they apparently had run out earlier in the evening, so he went with a bottled Dos Equis amber. Not a huge deal, again, I understand completely that things happen, but it was slightly disappointing. I ordered the \"beerita\", which is a margarita with a mini Corona bottle in it. It was okay, but I have absolutely had better. It was supposed to be frozen and it was more melty than anything, which I personally don't think tastes as great with the beer pouring into it.  Overall, I am certain we will be going back, but maybe for a lunch experience with beers rather than a dinner experience with specialty drinks.",

There were four of us eating and the pasta was the best: jerk chicken was great and just the right amount of heat.  The grilled chicken burritos were good: nothing special about them but nothing negative to say either.  Very spicy! The steak burrito was ok. Chambord margaritas were good bad strong. Would've liked more chambord in mine though. Overall, it's good, but didn't have exactly what I was looking for.",

They've got reasonable prices, the service is always great, and the best part of all is that they've got an amazing brunch menu...and don't even get me started on the cornbread.  It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it's some of the best cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it's free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.  A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla, bananas foster french toast (very sweet), and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren't a ton of items on the brunch menu, but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed.   The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z'Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food, and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can't ask for more than that. The only reason Z'Tejas isn't 5 stars is because is doesn't have that jaw dropping 'wow' factor with any of the dishes we've tried yet...it does have the \"mmm...that's realllly good\" factor going on...but not quite the \"Arrrrgggh, I'm gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure\" factor. Still...a great place.   4/5.",

I honestly can't remember what we ate for brunch/lunch but I know it was good (quite a bit of food though - recommend sharing if you can or doggie bag it).  The staff is all very friendly and welcoming as well.  For the late lunch we split the chile pork verde.  It was very very good (in love with Renegade's green chili pork stew though.)  We also split Leo's Street Tacos.  Both of these were very filling and absolutely amazing.  The salsa/sauce that accompanied these dishes had so much flavor - in fact all the ingredients had flavor.

After not having been for a while because we moved across town, we decided to travel the 30 minutes for Mother's Day dinner.   Wow. It is NOT the same place. I don't even know where to start. The service was poor. Very poor. Drink glasses were empty nearly the entire meal. The table wasn't cleared as we finished eating, so it was crowded with dirty and empty dishes and glasses.  And the food. I will confess the dumplings (yeah, they're back) were good. The queso was great. But that was it. They used to provide unlimited cornbread, but now they charge after the first pan. I get that, but even for a table of 5, we were only given one pan of corn bread...cut into four slices. How does that work?  My entree (the stuffed pork tenderloin that I've had numerous times) was OK...but luke warm, and not the amazing entree I'd had in the past. It was a little scorched on the bottom like it had been pre-cooked and then reheated.   The biggest disappointment? The fruit cobbler. It used to be amazing. Like crazy, delicious amazing. This time it literally tasted like a frozen pie that was heated a little and put in a cast iron skillet to serve. It wasn't even hot enough to melt the ice cream. And the amazing sauce that used to come with the? Non-existent. The server told me they had changed the recipe a few times...this wasn't a recipe, it was literally pie smashed into a skillet.   I must be the only person who didn't know how bad the restaurant had become. It was almost empty. Of course the irony is that people were being turned away, being told there weren't tables (maybe the were short staffed?). Well, they can have my table...not sure I will ever be back...which is so sad for me because it used to be my favorite place.",

    "text": "When my favorite location closed, I kind of forgot about Z Tejas, but seeing the Tatum location at lunchtime on a sweltering afternoon meant we had to stop. Eating out can be problematic for me as I am watching both my carbs and calories. The problem with Z Tejas is the Ancho Fudge Pie starts calling to me while I am still out in the parking lot. With that in mind, I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken salad with a warm bacon dressing (it kinda looks healthy) and  In order to maintain my hydration level,  I started with a blood orange margarita. Cold, refreshing and perfect, I unfortunately didn't remember the camera until my glass was empty. Frankly, I had forgotten about the cornbread, which is my idea of heaven. I had hopes that my husband would not eat the last piece, but he did! I learned you can easily pick up the last crumbs by licking a finger first  so that is why the pan was completely clean. Our meals were great--nicely presented, good tasting and way  too much. My salad was fresh, full of chicken, had just enough dressing and a tangy lump of goat cheese in the middle. As good as this was, I took a third home for later. Unfortunately, at this point, there was just no room for dessert. Great food, great drinks and superb service. Who could ask for more?",

I actually asked because it seemed sooooo small for the price. The picture is how it was served, same sloppy bowl. Can't believe if you don't buy on Happy Hour it's $13! Ordered Street tacos, 4 mini street tacos= $10.00.  Also ordered the Shrimp tostadas, was equally disappointing. The shrimp weren't much bigger than salad shrimp. Big waste of money, won't return. Thought this a month or so ago, but thought it was maybe a bad night for them-NOT!  Previously the items were priced individually for Happy Hour, now it's a flat $3 off. Not worth it. Boo!  3 appetizers, 2 beers, and 3 vodka and Soda = $79 plus %20 tip. Good thing this was all on happy hour prices. Ugh!",

I was going back and forth between a pecan crusted chicken salad and beef and chicken fajitas. I went with the SW classic, fajitas. The beef was tough and stringy (steak cut with the grain not against...rookie mistake not s chef) the chicken was so skimpy and dry. Peppers and onions weren't cooked through seemed to be thrown into a barely hot skillet and left to cook on the way to the table. They were not fajitas, they were terrible.  I switched to the salad, it was a hand full of spinach, a small dollop of goat cheese, some random small diced tomatoes and what I'm pretty sure was a frozen chicken pattie crusted in pecan dust and poorly cut into random sizes. My wife had some kind of sloppy soggy chicken stack. Oh and \"everything\" was unforgivably under seasoned. 2 entrees, 1 margherita and $44 later and me sharing my concerns, nothing not even an apology...except from our excellent server.",

I said we would be leaving soon - he said \"it's ok\" and I said actually it's not and asked them to clean after we finish eating.

There was s happy hour menu on the table so I ordered what I thought was a $4.50 draft beer but it wasn't happy hour yet so I was billed $6, no fun. I asked for spinach in my mac n cheese, they accommodated w no extra charge, that was nice. My gf asked why there was no cornbread; I guess they used to serve this free like chips n salsa at a Mexican joint. Server told us that the cornbread was replaced w free chips and salsa, which we never received. When we pointed that out the server tried to song and dance around it rather than apologize and move on. My husband enjoyed his entree, the fajitas, but was disappointed at the volume and the fact that he was up sold without being told. The server had asked if he wanted steak shrimp or chicken or two of the 3, it's extra to have a combo. It's not close enough that we will go back.",

Friendly and knowledgeable and knew the art of conversation. We ordered drinks and their renowned cornbread (for a cause) and of course the complimentary chips and salsa. Cornbread was warm, moist and delicious. House salsa was rich,  flavorful and not watery like some places. I ordered the Achiote Mahi Mahi with saffron rice. The chile and strawberry compote was amazing ( don't order if you do not like heat from the chiles). The Chef (my husband is a retired Executive Chef) ordered the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin with really smooth mashed potatoes and chiles. Pork was tender and the chorizo was not too spicy. Presentation was well thought out and not \"shot-gunned\" onto the plate like a lot of restaurants. Nice execution! Dinner was great and Joe, the manager was knowledgeable and personable. Joe surprised us with a slice of their ancho fudge pie which we thoroughly enjoyed. We will definitely be returning!",

This was served with a hot cup of perfectly seasoned black beans and warmed tortillas.   I had the trout for my entree. Wonderful. It  was perfectly cooked and topped with a portion of mango salsa. The vegetable medley was grilled just right bringing out their natural sweetness without being overdone.   For a cocktail it was the tejas mule - a tequila themed Moscow mule. Refreshing.   We'll be back.",

We started off with some guacamole and chips, AND of course the complimentary corn bread. All of these tasted amazing! I always ordered the miso glazed salmon back home. So, I just had to get my go-to and wasn't disappointed. The fish was so moist, flakey and flavorful. Even after being pretty full from the appetizers, I made sure to eat every last bite. I would definitely love to come back when I'm in the Phoenix area again.  Side note: We told our server we were visiting and he and the manager went above and beyond to make this a great dining experience. In addition to great service, they also provided recommendations for their favorite spots in AZ and things to do.",

We always get cornbread (even though it's no longer complimentary) and the cast iron skillet dumplings are a favorite of ours.   Another appetizer we enjoy is the Tejas Trio - salsa, guac and queso. The Diablo pasta comes into play once in a while and enchiladas are pretty solid. One thing we really enjoy - Chambord frozen margaritas!   Unfortunately, our last 2 experiences were subpar. One during a dine-in brunch and another for takeout dinner the other night. The service in-house has been slower and the dumplings seemed to have shrunken in size. It's hit or miss for us whenever we get Z'Tejas but it's hard to say no to frozen margs and the restaurant is a short drive from our house.",

Small skillet with measly amounts of steak and shrimp and just a few vegetables. The steak was sliced so thin it was ridiculous and there wasn't much of it . The shrimp, all 5, were very small.  This dish was $18. Are you kidding me?  I'm a pretty small person, with an average appetite... I can't imagine my husband ordering that and being satisfied. Honestly, it was appetizer sized.

The Trio Platter with chips, salsa, guacamole and queso is where I always start. The guac is fresh made and always super green. The queso is creamy with a little bit of spice from the chipotle sauce on top. The Peppercorn Crusted Filet is always so tender, topped with Roasted Mushroom Cream Sauce and cooked exactly to medium just the way I like it - I always ask for more sauce because who doesn't like more sauce . The Diablo Chicken Pasta with Chicken (Shrimp also available) is my ultimate favorite that I eat almost once a week. The chicken has a jerk spice that is grilled and always tender and juicy. The linguine is made with spinach and red pepper then covered in cream sauce topped with salsa fresca, cotija cheese and sliced jalapenos. The name Diablo Chicken makes it sound super spicy, but it really isn't that spicy so don't be scared!!",

    "text": "My all-time favorite restaurant EVER!! We fell in love  (the restaurant and I) like 20 years ago when they had a location in Washington. It was my go-to, for birthdays, brunch, meeting friends. I had initially tried the Chambord Margarita and was forever hooked. That margarita was probably where the one-drink-buzz-girl originated.   Pro-tip: get the Chambord Margarita!! Beware of ice cream headache (I'm serious!).   I could eat only appetizers and be content. The Texas Trio, Chile Verde and cornbread are a must! All 3 come in a cast iron skillet. The Trio is a cheese dip, guacamole and salsa served with chips. I recommend it for a starter. The Chile Verde could be my last meal (if I was forced to choose) or what I'd eat if I was stranded on a desert island and only had one food.  It's SO good. It's not too spicy, the right amount of tang, served with black beans and tortillas. The cornbread comes out oven hot and the butter just melts on top. Delish!  My usual entree is the Pecan Crusted Chicken Spinach with goat cheese. Great flavors, not too heavy.    Our waiter, Alex, was phenomenal! He had a great sense of humor and engaged really well.  He gave us recommendations, which we loved.   I have to fly to another state to enjoy my favorite restaurant and their signature margarita and it's WORTH IT!!!",

There's two hostess, just standing by the door, chatting and not even greeting the customer as they enter their establishment but they have one server, running around like a hamster, kinda kill it for everyone there. I am glad to see the bus boy helping to pour ice water for refills.  It was very warm there today as they're fixing their A.C. System.  They should really request to do A.C. maintenance before summer so, this don't happen again in the future.  It will also be great if they warn you regarding the issues their having for customers consideration because everyone would like to enjoy their meal when they dine in. I believed everyone dislikes to rush their meal due to being uncomfortable in a warm establishment.  Today, was definitely a eat and run situation :/",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying the service was awesome. We came in on a Thursday evening around 5:30pm. From the hostess, food runners, to our server and what appeared to be a manager, everyone was pleasant and quick to take our order, being out food, refill our drinks, etc. They even brought out the wrong entree to me, and I didn't notice, however they still corrected themselves and brought the actual item I ordered, while letting us keep the incorrect order as well. Service alone is was brought the review up to a three.   The food though... it's alright. For the price point I feel like it's definitely nothing special. It's not horrible it's just super basic. The only thing that stood out for me was the cornbread (first skillet you request is free), that was tasty.   We ordered the Baja fish tacos and the Santa Fe enchilada (minus the sauce).   The enchilada was fine. Beans were meh and the rice had a kick to it, which we weren't fond of.   I was brought the blackened catfish taco appetizer but I didn't know what to expect from my actual order of Baja tacos, so when I heard \"fish tacos\" I just assumed that was it. I began eating them and thought they were alright. Lots of slaw and a little spicy. They were cute little rolls. Not terrible.   Then it was revealed that wasn't what I ordered! Now I feel dumb... but of course I then put aside the catfish and try the Baja fish tacos, which I believe are made with cod. These had some slaw and mango topping, they were ok, I just felt like the flavor combo they were going for didn't actually come out well. I've had much better elsewhere.   Check was around $32 for our two entrees (that we ordered). Of course the extra appetizer was a nice accidental bonus but I still feel for the price, it just didn't deliver.   If you don't care too much about the food, at least there is good service! Not sure that I'll return.",

    "text": "Do not go to this place on Friday or Saturday unless you like RUDE and UNFRIENDLY bartenders or whenever JASON (one of the managers) is working. He is less than concerned about the UNFRIENDLINESS and RUDENESS of the bartenders ( CHRIS and the other GUY) will update his name. JASON seemed to want to spin the concern and undermine my complaint about how RUDE they addressed me and downright UNFRIENDLY service I received ( if you can call it that ).  He simply did not want to here it. NOTE: so the manager doesn't spin it again- they are always RUDE and UNFRIENDLY- finally felt I had to say something. They will be happy to hear I will not make that mistake again.- For Owners information- most people know they are UNFRIENDLY and RUDE but do not say anything. I have only been in business 35 years and know a little something about good help. These 3 Amigos aren't good for your business. Did I mention RUDE AND UN FRIENDLY. I personally would fire the 3 of them based on the LACK of professional interaction and LACK of customer service /people skills.  However come when the REAL bartender is working MARTIE (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday)  -he will promptly serve you with respect and friendliness. I have been coming here for 11 years and MARTIE has NEVER been rude and has ALWAYS treated me with respect and dignity. He is very personable and friendly -( Knows how to talk to customers ). There is a REASON everyone loves MARTIE- CLUE",

If you've never had the Pecan-crusted chicken salad, it is a nice, but not heavy, entree. If you have room, the Ancho Fudge Pie is delicious.  And of course, the best margaritas in town. I'm not a fan of frozen margaritas, but Z'Tejas' are wonderful - with or without the Chambord! They are so good, they limit the number you can have 'cuz the tend to sneak up on you!",

If the service were good, the food would be a  5 but the prices are a bit high to beg for a refill from a random server.  Diablo pasta is spicy and has interesting flavor. Others had a steak, fish tacos, and quesadilla.  Everyone finished their food And enjoyed it but commented on the lack of service. It will be a while before I try again.",

Fortunately happy hour is available through the entire restaurant!  We of course got the Chambord margaritas, only $5 during happy hour.  This would be one of the most perfect margaritas in town if I never found out the calories: over 400!  Too bad because 3 of these babies will have you down & out!  We shared the shrimp guacamole bites first which were very good & not too heavy.  The shrimp has a delicious grilled flavor that really enhances the bite.  Next we did the catfish tacos, really yummy!  These are two flour tortillas rolled with catfish avocado & cabbage.  Lastly we shared the pork tostadas which were decent but not as light as the first two apps.  The best thing here is the achiote chicken chopped salad!  Usually this is what we order, and I love how they will mix it at your table.  Usually I keep the dressing on the side & don't let them mix it.",

    "text": "I've frequented this location of Z'tejas a few times and usually have a great experience and enjoyable meal.  This trip, however, was my worst experience there. The restaurant was only half full so we got right in on a Saturday night and that led me to believe that we would have great service. It took us awhile to see our server to order drinks and even longer to place our food order. We realized later that she had tables scattered all over the restaurant, including outside. Poor planning on the part of management. My order came out incorrectly and my husband's burger was way over cooked. We all ran out of drinks in our glasses and had to stop eating to wait to get refills. It probably took 10 minutes from the time our glasses were empty to the time we had refills. When we were done eating, we were not offered dessert and were just presented with the check. Disappointed in this experience and hope this isn't the norm for this restaurant now. If so, I don't think I'll be back.",

We didn't want for anything and pretty much kept her on her toes all evening but she rose to the occasion. I had a Chambord Margarita. Actually there was more than one. We had several appetizers, including the tableside guacamole. While it was good, I have never had cotilla cheese on my guac before, so I think I would leave that off in the future. We also had the Green Chile Pork nachos and we all enjoyed those. The queso was tasty but I later realized it likely had flour in it (as a thickening agent) so my bad for not asking about that in advance (I'm gluten intolerant). A friend who is also GF got the Street Tacos and enjoyed them. And another friend got the Flat Top Grilled Quesadillas and she really liked them too. We'll be back!",

Z'Tejas promises \"Mexican-inspired\" cuisine but they deliver a tepid blend of ingredients that do little to inspire one's tastebuds.  The baked seafood enchilada had next to no taste, and when combined with a cardboard-like texture it was entirely unappetizing.  The fish tacos were slightly better but a Filet-'O'-Fish is more drool-inspiring.    On the positive side, the cornbread wasn't bad and the service was reasonably attentive, but it's not enough to rescue the poor offerings from the kitchen.",

I let her do the ordering since I'm sure she knew all the good stuff. We started off with Strawberry Margaritas and they are really good! It's a great way to get your buzz going since they're strong too. As for appetizers, we got the Tejas Trio, Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings, and the Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostada Bites.   The Tejas Trio was basically your chips and salsa, except it came with guacamole, chile con queso with chorizo and salsa picante. The Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings were spicy shrimp and pork, wrapped in wontons, steamed and seared, served with a sweet ginger soy dipping sauce. These were really good, I loved the sauce that was drizzled over it. The Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostada Bites were tiny little tostada rounds topped with fresh guacamole with marinated grilled shrimp on top. Everything at our table was pretty good and I enjoyed it all even though we only ordered drinks and appetizers.   Even though Z'Tejas is located in college town, the crowd in here was a little bit older. I'd say it was mostly people in their twenties or thirties. It's a pretty big restaurant and it looks like a great place to drink and hang out if you want to get away from the typical college crowd. I think they have great happy hour specials as well.",

    "text": "Loved the meal, hated the atmosphere. I've been to Z'Tejas before and while I miss the Voodoo tuna terribly, I had my go-to alternate choice - the ruby trout salad. That was after the scrumptious shrimp tostada bites (grilled shrimp on top of avocado on top of a tostada) and a decent, though not extraordinary tortilla soup. I particularly liked the fact that Z'Tejas doesn't scrimp on the trout.  What really made the meal challenging, though, were the screaming kids. Not just one or two, but wherever you looked in the restaurant. True, we ate around 6:30pm on a Saturday, and that was well before the wee ones' bedtimes, but still.... Perhaps the hostess interspersed those with young kids among the quieter diners to balance out the noise level to an even roar throughout the restaurant, but to those who just wanted to have a nice meal and talk, it was more than a bit distracting, annoying, and uncomfortable. Look, I get the fact that Z'Tejas wants to be family friendly, but not everyone thinks a person's kid exercising his developing lungs is special - at least not in a good way.  Here's a radical suggestion. No, I'm not going to suggest barring kids from the restaurant. That would be wrong for the type of restaurant and would subject Z'Tejas to social media flaming. Rather, might I propose that people with kids under 12 be escorted to a section of the restaurant with other kids under 12, preferably where the noise level will be tolerable elsewhere in the establishment? For parents who object, feeling that they ought to be able to be around people who are quieter than they are, so as not to encourage their kids to scream any louder, that's just rude. You made your McDonald's Playland, now lie in it. We are not your siblings, parents, or grandparents. We do not necessarily think all of your kids' antics are adorable, nor do we feel we owe you some special consideration because you chose to have kids with you. We just want to have a nice meal with a reasonable noise level.  Okay, go ahead. Tell me why it is sooooo horrible for me to buy a meal without sustaining hearing loss or why I should think it precious that when you leave your table, it takes a crime scene cleanup crew to pull food, drink, crayons, and other debris off of tables, chairs and carpet (and we can't avoid seeing the disgusting mess or being jostled by the clean team).  Look. You're proud of your kids and/or you want to socialize them. Understood. But can't the restaurant serve one demographic without destroying another's evening?",

On that visit I think the server started several hours prior to our arriving. He did not know the menu and service was painfully slow. All we wanted to do was get out of there. Our son's hamburger was not cooked as requested and the dressing on my Caesar salad was too spicy to eat. Shame on the server for not giving me a warning.  This restaurant had a lot going for it especially with it's happy hour anywhere in the restaurant and was always crowded. I hope they get things turned around before it is too late.   Yesterday the local newspaper ran an article that this chain had filed bankruptcy.",

The food is still decent but not worth it without the great happy hour pricing they used to have.   We also ordered the cornbread (no longer free, but they now donate the proceeds to chairty), which is made to order. We were told it was taking a little longer because it was in the oven.  After about 30 minutes AFTER we finished our dinner, the cornbread came out cold. I asked the server to throw it in the microwave but she did end up replacing it. Must have been a screaming hot oven.   Also, after reading some of the reviews citing similar complaints as mine and getting harrassed by the business owner is incredibly disappointing. That fact alone motivated me to write this review about my recent experience there. Sorry Z, you just lost a customer.  UPDATE - I too got the harrassing email from Greg C regarding this review. I also got an email from Z Tejas directly confirming they have no affiliation with Greg C (thank god! That guy has issues to harass people giving their opinion about a restaurant). The email from Z Tejas offered his apology regarding my experience and offer to come in and discuss what they are doing and why. Appreciated, but not necessary. He also said he just dropped off a check of $25,000 to the Pheonix Children's hospital, which is a wonderful thing. I would gladly pay $3 for cornbread to continue the donations.",

The biscuits & gravy were ok, but could not eat the eggs or the sausage links.  Muffins which used to be good were now awful.  Had ONE blueberry in my muffin and it was a bland white mix muffin.  Not sure what happened here, like did management change along with menu?  But beware, the brunch has gone seriously downhill.  I doubt we will ever try it again.",

Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, bar none. Also, the best margaritas--my favorite is the house margarita made with chambord, but there is a martini styled one that is great as well.   I have tried everything on the menu in the last several years and there is really not anything I would not suggest trying--but the crispy salmon is one of my favorites. I usually fill up on chips and salsa though and get one of their good dinner sized salads. Still miss their crispy shrimp--maybe one day they will bring it back.  Service is almost always good and quick.  Friday nights are fun--when I get there around 7 most of the happy hour crowd is crawling out and tables open up. I actually think the mix of tourists, left over happy hour crowd and families is a great mix. It loud, casual and laid back. Wish there were more places like it in the area.",

As I am a huge fan of margarita's and I believe not many places know how to make them right, Z Teja's did not disappoint. I look for a margarita that is swift to knock you right on your ass. There, I admitted that I like to have the tequila kick when I drink. I had one (ok I lied two) of their raspberry swirl margarita's (which I cannot tell you what the hell they called it) that almost looked too pretty to drink. However, I was disappointed in their nachos as I thought they would have all the glorious toppings besides just black bean cheese and lettuce....come on people step up the Mexican. They also had cornbread which was brought out like bread, and I love cornbread but not sure I liked the actual pieces of corn?! New Englanders are not used to our cornbread that way....But I really think this place has its drinks together, and I wouldn't mind going back again sometime....",

    "text": "I too had the privilege of dining here this evening and found the food and service to be the best its been in years.  I have always had a great experience dining at Ztejas.  Normally I tend to take a first date here as the margariatas can turn a 5 or 6 into a 10. (no explanation necessary).  Anyhow, tonight i didn't drink as I wanted to fully appreciate the food and focus on giving it a thorough evaluation. Our waiter was great, my water was consistenly being filled and the GM was very hospitable.  I had the grilled shrimp and guacamole tostada bites for an appetizer.  Wow, were these delicious.  Fresh guac, shrimp was grilled to perfection and tostadas were fresh as well.  I also Inhaled my own cornbread.  If you are looking to carboload before a big cardio day or race, this is for you! I then had my normal  red chile and mango steak salad as the main. I typically have an appetite fit for a pro wrestler, but tonight after my own cornbread and shrimp tostadas... I couldn't finish my main course. I also believe the portions are generous.  for 11 bucks a steak salad with fresh meat and mangos is a very good deal and certainly economical compared to most restaurants.  Anyhow, it was a fine dining experience from service to food and I will definitely be back there to take down some ritas, tortiallas, and maybe some chicas! just kidding.",
