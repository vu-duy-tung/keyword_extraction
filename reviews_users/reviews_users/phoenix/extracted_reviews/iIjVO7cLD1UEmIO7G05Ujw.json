Remarkably, the quality of the food remains as good as it was in 1985 when New Times considered it the best Mexican in town.  I'm a huge fan of the red and green chile and the chips and salsa might be my last meal if I were heading to the gas chamber.  I was amazed to find the efficient older waitress in the main room still there.  She waited on me in 1985!",

They have excellent carne asada and their refried beans are the best I have ever had.

Tie for favorite items are the shrimp chili rellano plate and the two ground beef and potato tacos. The taco shells, like the chips, are freshly prepared and topped to the brim with lettuce and cheese. Just a very legit mexican dining experience.",

    "text": "It has been about a year since I last visited this place, but I subscribe to their Facebook page and always see their updated posts and photos.  I used to be a taxi driver in Phoenix, and I would go here after working nights to take a break, either to have breakfast or brunch.  First off, let me say that they have the best menudo in Phoenix, either red or white, and it is available every day, whereas most Mexican places will only have it available on weekends.  The menudo actually tastes homemade, not like it was just poured out of a can and reheated.  As far as the rest of their dishes, they also have a variety of tasty platters, such as different kinds of tacos, enchiladas, and \"burros\" (not burritos.... but the actual correct term of a big Mexican wrap; the term \"giant\" or \"big\" burrito is actually a contradiction or an oxymoron, but anyway I digress... back to the review!).  They also have chips and salsa, both the red and green variety.  The food is actually tasty and flavorful, unlike many of the other \"-berto's\" fast food Mexican places all around town, which for the most part, is bland and all tastes the same. Sure, it might be a bit unfair for me to make that comparison, since Rosita's is a restaurant and not a fast food joint.  And I'm not saying Filiberto's or Julioberto's or any of those other place are bad.  But what I'm saying is that I am willing to drive far just to eat out here at Rosita's, which is what the difference is.  This place can get crowded on a Sunday, so as usual, plan accordingly.",

Head south-east my friend, over to Rosita's.  This is a great little 'hole in the wall' eatery.  I wasn't disappointed, and neither was the group I had in tow.  Their re-fried beans were so creamy and flavour-ful.  Yeah, that's right, I used a 'u' in flavour, because they're that good.  Next time I'm in the area, I plan on giving the frozen horchata with coconut rum a taste.  Be forewarned, the place is small, so if there is a group of cackling hens at the table behind you doing tequila shooters, it will make for a vexing dining experience.",

My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)  Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:  Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...  Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!  And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!  So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!",

I went with an open mind and the waitress was great at first and got our drinks out fast but after asking for our order about 2 mins into us sitting down and we replied we want nachos but we need a few more minutes to choose our entree, it was a wrap. Took 15 mins to get our nachos and they didn't ask us for our order for at least 30mins. I made eye contact to let them know we wanted to order and they just walked away. About 10 mins later I walked up and asked someone working here if we could order and she said yes and Walked away for 10 more minutes... At this point we were over it and not hungry from the 2 lbs of cheese on chips that were supposed to cost $5.75. By the time the lady came back to take our order we weren't really hungry and just over the whole experience, so we asked for a check and a Togo box to take home the nasty nachos. Not sure if it was an honest mistake or not but she charged us $10 for nachos that cost $5.75. Such a joke. I really wanted to try their food too but they lost me. They need to realize phoenix is growing since 1964 and they need more than 1 hostess, 1 server, and 1 busser. I'm sad. Will never return. Gross food, shitty service. try ritos, comedor Guadalajara, el norteno, el carbon, tacos Julisco... And if you want American Mexican food try tee pee, ajo als, don Jose, Los Olivos, I am passionate about Mexican food and this place is a complete joke. Please do yourself a favor and skip this place.",

This place is awesome (food), sure the service could be better and if this place were in a better building it would ROCK for date nights.  Green Chile beef burrito is to die for, nice kick, lots of sauce and very good with an egg and beans.    Now for those who knocked their beans and rice, unless you make them all your life, this place makes them PERFECT...  I've tried their ground beef and potato tacos, good compared to other places I've tried.    The best menudo in town, unless your parents make it.   Prices here are not bad and I've never go wrong.  This place is very close comparison to Tee-Pee which is very good also.",

My favorite thing to get is a machaca burrito.  Excellent rice and beans come with it.  I go every time I'm in Arizona and I wish I was there right now!",

    "text": "After an online argument with Julia T. about what constitutes Mexican food, I decided to try Rosita's Place, since she gave it such high praise.   Upon walking in, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how clean the restaurant was. I was expecting more of a Carolina's type atmosphere. The lady who brought us our menus and sat us was very friendly. I thought the fish pond, while extremely odd, was a relaxing touch in the center of the dining room.   We ordered a half-pitcher of margarita, some chips (since they were raved about) and it all came pretty much right away. The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand.   Overall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food. I want to know what drugs people are on that makes them think this place has any type of quality. I'll probably go back and try something else, because it had a few things going for it, but the food is NOT one of them.  +1 for cleanliness +1 for service -3 for food",

I did not even dig in to my Chimichanga, as I was so full of chips & salsa, and my tacos of course. The decor is very simple, and the seating/booths are very basic.

WHAT?!?!?  How can you give me a taco without cheese!  The meat was OK but the taco itself was very greasy.  My husband ordered two enchiladas, one machaca and one chicken.  He liked the machaca but took two bites of his chicken and didn't like it.  I have to admit their horchata (rice milk drink) was good and a good size.

She's older, long black hair, always pulled back. I'm not sure why she seems to always be so unhappy but my advice to her is get out of the business. No one wants to deal with your misery and you should find something that makes you happy.

That is the only reason why we gave it 3 stars.   We're definitely coming back & do recommend Rosita's Place.",

I always try to take friends & family anytime anyone visits Phoenix!     (P.S., Watch the low-rated reviews... They're often not reasonable! 1 complained that there was a difference in price for a \"machaca chimi & another exactly the same but not deep fried\"... Well, that's simple to figure out if they'd actually looked at the menu! Chimi is deep fried & has 1 price, but BURROS are not deep fried & differently priced!  Another complained just because they're closed for renovations! WTF?!)",

Chips and salsa are free in Texas, so hopefully other Mexican restaurants will 'get with the program'.   Their fajitas come with homemade tortillas (DELICIOUS), and the salsa was tasty. The mango drink tasted canned but their horchata is great!  It's a very kid friendly environment. There's a waterfall near the entrance (with fish in it!). Service was okay. Could have been better, could have been worse. I would go back for the food and hope for better service (that's why the 3 stars only, not 4).",

The waitress staff minus the young one have been there FOREVER & treat you like your very own Tia (mexican for aunt) & are very helpful & knowledgable. Love these ladies. The Divorced Eggs are perfect every time. If you like 2 sunny side up eggs, hot fresh tortillas seperated by a line of beans but can't decide between red or green sauce this is your freakin' plate. The posole while only on the menu part of the year is the real reason to visit. The guacamole is good good & the chips aren't free but are cooked to order hot & fresh. So go forth & enjoy some great Mexican food.  Tip - the green salsa is hotter then the red. Don't say I didn't warn ya.",

One thing I didn't see mentioned too much was that compared to a lot of  mainstream mex restaurants this place generally has  much spicier food and salsa.  So if you don't like your mex food \"hot\" this may not be the place for you.  It's not overdone hot like a few places but definitely a step up from mainstream.  At least ask when you order how hot the particular dish might be.  Their salsa is way hotter than most places.  I have taken out of town guests here and it's been too hot for several of them.",

I was alone and didn't really want to eat near a lot of people,  especially when there were other areas that were empty. I had to ask to sit somewhere else. She let me pick. I found another spot, but I was initially overwhelmed by the smell of bleach. I guess they use that to clean the tables. It went away. But I thought that was worth noting.

The prices were good, particularly considering how much food you get.  I ended up taking more than half of my food home.   The food was delicious!  The two kinds of salsa were both fresh and delicious.  The red was my favorite of the two because of its smoky flavor.  They make their chips on the spot when you order them, so they were hot and crunchy.  I ordered the machaca. I had never had it before and it was phenomenal.  I also ordered the green chile, which I expected to be spicier since it had an * warning, but I could have handled a little more heat to the dish.  I can only imagine what they put in the refried beans to make them so good, my arteries probably should not inquire.  They serve homemade tortillas, hot and fresh.  They can bury me in one like a shroud one day.   I will definitely go back to try other things.",

I personally rarely review restaurants but felt compelled to write one because I want others looking for good Mexican food to avoid this place. The staff was pleasant and accommodating but that could not make up for the bad tasting food!  I'm in town from Los Angeles, so not sure if the there is a regional difference in Mexican cooking but if you're used to good Mexican food in the likes of LA stay clear from this place. The beans were dry, the guacamole was made with cheap tasting avocados, the albondiga soup was tasteless and the chorizo and eggs plate was made with some type of meat that tasted nothing like chorizo. I feel bad writing this review but if you're in town and its past 9 pm on a weekday just go to Taco Bell ( never thought I'd say this!) Oh and when we got the check we couldn't read the chicken scratch on it. As it turns out it was done on purpose as the waitress added her tip into the tab, but she never told us she did. Had we not asked the host to review the check we would have left her a double tip- tricky!!!!",

It was heavenly. Good flavor.  Tons of meat,  good guac.  Again,  I knock a star for the grease. It was dripping out of the burro. The beans were the best I've ever had.

    "text": "Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.  Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.  As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's.  This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas.   Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.  Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right.   What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others.   Here's my suggestion. Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.  The food, ambiance, service are all superb.  This is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food.  This is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa.",

Put on some Spanish music - like flamenco -would really make this place seem classy. I know, I know it's Mexican food. Or even put on some authentic mariachi music that would really take this place to the next level. That being said, the food is spot on. Exactly what I expected and it is always so consistent. Somehow there are so many business owners that don't realize the value of nice dim lighting and music even if it's quiet in the background. There's a jukebox in here, in my opinion... A terrible terrible idea. Just choose the music you don't want people decide most people are going to put on crap or in this case nobody is playing any music and all I'm hearing is hum of  the air-conditioning.",

    "text": "Mexican Food Done Right  My co-worker and I decided we wanted authentic Mexican food for lunch and after reading reviews for Rosita's we headed down to 24th Street and McDowell for lunch.  Rosita's isn't one of those typical  fancy chain \"Mexican Gourmet\" restaurants.  Rosita's is the real deal and the folks at Rosita's are doing \"Mexican Food\" up right.  As we entered the restaurant we sat ourselves at a table.  Our server took our drink order and brought us a huge basket  of chips and salsa.  The chips at Rosita's are made fresh to order and served sizzling hot. These chips are thin, crispy, lightly salted, and absolutely delicious. I could have easily ate the entire basket but needed to save room for our lunch entree's.   Usually when I dine at a Mexican Restaurant  I order a machaca burrito enchilada style, so there is no telling how many machaca burritos enchilada style  I've earen over the years. So, today was no diffrent. I had the machaca beef burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. One of the best machaca burritos I've even eaten.  The machaca was moist, tender, and full of flavor.   My tastebuds were in heaven. Not only was my burrito delicious,  the serving was large, and I mean very large.  I couldn't even finish half my burrito.    Everything we tried was unbelievably tasty. From the  machaca burrito, chicken mole, green chili tamale, to the guacamole & beans each dish was absolutely delicious.  If your ever in the area, stop by Rosita's you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "After an airport pickup, my company wanted some authentic Mexican. Took to Yelp to help us out and we were sadly let down. The service was abysmal. Our server came the second we sat down to get our food and drink order, but never having dined there we had no idea what to get. After some time spent talking and eating the salsa from the hottest depths of hell, we realized we hadn't see her in around 20 minutes so we asked for someone to take our order.  Let me just say, I'm not cheap (swear!) I just hate getting ripped off. We ordered one machaca chimi with rice and beans and another exactly the same but not deep fried, got it? The bill read $10 for the first one and $14 for the second. The menu reads you can get anything deep fried for an additional $1, so why the heck was I charged $4 for saving the cook time and precious fryer oil? DUMB.   Other notable annoyances: they were out of horchata with no answer to when more would be made, the beans were nearly white- too much lard?, the machaca beef was inedible due to many crispy/nasty/grisly bits, the server never came back to check on us or any tables around us after the food was dropped off.   We left both our meals on the table and will not be back. Ever.   Never, ever.",

I had a bean and cheese burrito with green chili sauce and it was huge and delicious and very reasonably priced. We were a large party right in the middle of the lunch rush and the service was still great and food pretty fast. Everyones meal looked great and they all reported that theirs was amazing as well. The place is not fancy but a good vibrant atmosphere. Can't wait to try more items and go back over and over!",

The green sauce is my favorite, and yesterday the red was on point also. Almost always order the same thing: Green chili burro with green sauce. The burro is big enough and I try to only eat half, so I have a great leftover. Yes, they charge a buck for chips - but they are hot, fresh and right from the fryer, just the way I like them! Modelo Especial on tap :-) We drive from Tempe just to eat here when we crave a good Mexican food plate. Beans are also excellent, as well as the green corn tamales. Enjoy.",

The real takeaway here was the tortillas. The chips,  taco/tostada shells, and the enchilada tortilla were hands down my favorite parts of the meal.

We watch numerous customers come in WAY after us, and order AFTER us, and get their food BEFORE us.  We chalk this up to only one thing.  We are white, and the others getting better service are hispanic.  Now that the food is not satisfactory, I see no reason to go back.  My beef taco was a mixture of mealy beef and chunks of potato.  It was so disgusting I couldn't even eat it.  There has been a definite change in the food from years ago.  Yuk.

Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!  The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says \"Please control your children!\" I love it.

Boy, was I sorry.   Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my \"stranger bubble\" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant.   Next time, I won't contest it when Hubby suggests Carolina's (who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town).",

    "text": "A coworker brought me here about a month ago and I was genuinely surprised when I walked into this place.  It was pretty clean and colorful in everything you expect from a traditional Mexican restaurant in the valley.  Plus, they had individual La Rosa candy for sale at the register.   They could accommodate our group of 8 pretty easily at lunchtime and although service was pretty slow, it was a decent experience.  I think I had red cheese enchiladas and was pleased enough with the flavors that my husband and I returned here this past weekend.   It was early Sunday afternoon and there were a handful of people in the restaurant.  We were sat in the booth in the far corner by the server station; where the seat is pretty well worn and the vibration from some nearby machine rattles your back.  We asked to be moved to a booth by the window; this time I scored the good seat and my husband got the lumpy one (score).    Chips are hot (charge: $1) and salsa is pretty good.  His machaca plate order inspired me to get machaca red enchiladas this time.  The machaca was pretty drippy with oil/water and it flooded my plate so I sent it back for some posole- there was really no saving the plate.  I understand it's Mexican food and greasy but it was a little more than norm.  Our extremely nice server that reminded me of my Tia was gracious and gave me a squinted eye \"I agree\" when I kindly made the request.  The posole was downright tasty- and pretty meaty- a very thick red chile broth that was more stew like, nice texture on the hominy and served with lemon and minced green onion.  It had a nice kick to it.  Overall, it was a solid 3-star experience.",

Whenever I go there I have to order the green chili tamales, mmm it is so yummy!! They have delicious authentic mexican drinks as well, and I tried their mango-chile and rum mixed drink, it is a must if you like the mexican candies it tastes like that but blended in a cold alcoholic concoction.

    "text": "I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill.",

Mariachis Insanely large glass of iced tea Atmosphere  I think Rosita's Place is the real deal.  It's not healthy food; it may not be particularly inventive food.

I have my faves: I'm a fan of chile rellenos, I like hard shell tacos and my regular order is a chicken enchilada with salsa verde. Which one, which one.... All three! Piggy. It was the best taco of my life, fresh made tortilla slightly pinched in at the top with A+ cheese and fresh, cold lettuce and a large amount of deliciously prepared shredded chicken. I wanted more than one but then.... I had ordered a taste of the mole and was blown away by the fresh spices I could taste, definitely NOT a mix. Chicken enchilada was served with a skirt surround of melted cheese that was so beautiful I'm sorry I didn't photograph it first. I took half of that home with me and intended to do the same for the chile relleno, but I couldn't - I ate every bit but for a little taste to my friend, and it was not small. You go for the food, right? They serve Negro Modelo and the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. I cannot recommend this culinary fix enough. Not that I'd move there but you Phoenixians are lucky to have this culinary treat and with such reasonable pricing.",

Sent them back, they came back with no color and soggy. Yea, not eating those. Asked for chorizo with fried eggs, but got it all scrambled. Ook...guess I don't get to decide my own food. Not busy btw. Tamales were old and tough as leather. Which is really strange thing for Tamales. Ordered eggs and bacon and the eggs were so over cooked, just supposed to be scrambled but has more brown than the hashbrowns. Bacon was thrown in the deep fryer making a dry powdery product. I'll come back here when I'm hungover. I won't mind the mediocre food for the price they offer. Ok, if I could do two and half stars I would. Between service and prices it deserves it, but the kitchen really dropped the ball in produces some horrible breakfast. Again our server, Reina, was fantastic, just wanted to mention it again.",

    "text": "My husband and I are in town celebrating his birthday and catching a Rams/Cardinals game. My cousins who live in Phoenix highly recommended this spot for a good Mexican breakfast. My husband looooves menudo so we decided to give this spot a try. The restaurant is clearly popular, has lots of customers & offers a very deep list of delicious foods. After waiting for roughly 15 minutes they call our name and seat us. Not bad, only a 15 min wait at what looks like is going to be a good experience. After sitting at our table for 10 minutes & seeing two families that were seated after us already being served, I get up & ask the hostess what was going on. She apologized & a very nice gentleman also apologized and immediately asked us what we wanted to drink & brought us chips/salsa. He jokes with us about how the Rams are going to lose and we all three laugh. He had great personality & got the experience back on track. A woman comes over and takes our order, has a bitter look on her face & has zero personality. A rock on the side of the road has more personality than this woman did. We order, tryyyying desperately to get our experience back on track since our cousins recommended this spot & sadly the experience never got back on track simply because our server was dull. Borderline rude. Our food wasn't bad at all, my husbands menudo was delicious he said & my beans/rice burrito was good too. The salsa is delicious & I was happy they had Jamaica. When I went up to pay the bill the woman at the counter apologized again to us, said she removed the drinks from our bill and I told her \"no worries\" & that we left a cash tip and to enjoy the rest of her weekend. All and all, I gave this spot a 3 stars. Simply because the server couldn't smile, make any conversation with us & ultimately pulled our overall experience mediocre. The others who interacted with us were kind, apologetic & genuinely wanted to make our experience positive. Next time we are in town visiting we may give this place another shot. If not, we wouldn't be losing out on much.",

The chips and salsa and fresh and wonderful! Cheese enchiladas, Chicken tacos(hard shell), and the Beef tacos,my favorites on all of these.  It is family owned, which might be another reason it is so good. They really care about the food,how it tastes, if it is hot, and fresh. It is very clean here, as well as the restrooms.

I appreciate the hospitality and customer service I was given with no questions. I will definitely be coming back to rositas.",

    "text": "I do not know what is the big deal about this place, it seems to be very popular.  First, the parking is way in the back and the exit is very narrow. I have been here a few times and I never got a warm and fuzzy feeling. Like service is OK but not actually friendly. A couple other visits were solid 3 stars, our last one was one star... or zero if I could. So in the interest of averages, I will give 2 stars on this review. So we got there, were told to wait to be seated. After like 3 minutes we got a table. After like 3 minutes we got chips and salsa... Chips were over done, tasted a little close to burned. We tried to get new chips and nothing. We waited for someone to take our beverage order and nothing... A party was seated behind me and they got service right away. The hostess stopped nearby to seat another party, I asked if we had a server because no one had stopped by. ... Time went by. .... We got up and left and went to La Barquita (just a few blocks away), and had really good soup for dinner (2 caldo de res, and one chicken soup).",

The place you park is in an alley where stray cats and dogs just freely roam   around . Then you come in and nobody is pleasant or helpful. The service is bad the food is mediocre and all the waitresses look miserable to working here. Order was wrong and currently still waiting for my sons quesadilla it's been 20 minutes. Not sure where these good reviews came from because we will not be back and pretty sure \"Rosita\" is walking around not checking on customers but counting all the patrons in here. Like I said before will not come again and will warn people against this place. Only reason it's getting two stars is because I felt for our waitress who is expecting and looks exhausted. Long story short stay away from here if you're looking for good service and authenticity. Oh and this is NOT Authentic it's Americanized Mexican please review correctly.",

No hospitality, one of the waitresses had her fingers in her mouth picking her teeth in plain site, so disgusting. That should of been my first sign to exit. My niece's ordered carne asada burritos, the food was not fresh and had a sour taste to it, tons of hard pieces . The asada was more like day old hard meat that had been sitting out in the sun,  I'm pretty sure it was already expired. The mole I ordered was bland, no taste at all. Our food was such poor quality, zero freshness. If I could, I would rate this place a zero. I've watched over the years the quality of the food and waitstaff take a nose dive. This is the only establishment in town were the waitresses  always seem annoyed and unfriendly. The food quality is so poor. This place has lost my business for good,  I will not recommend it to friends or family.",

Even the mild stuff we asked for was on the spicy side...it had a good flavor but the heat it produced from whatever spice they are using overwhelmed the tasty flavor for us... Will we return? Probably not but just because it was too spicy...if you like and can handle spice go ahead and give it a try....",

I could've easily shared this with my wife and been satisfied. The prices are awesome as well. The only thing I find odd is that they charge you for the usual complimentary chips and salsa that you would get at any other Mexican place you go to. They don't tell you that either.

    "text": "I was craving Tamales for 2 days, so I typed in tamales in Phoenix and a list of 10 Best Places for Tamales in Metro Phoenix came up and Rosita's Place was # 8, I picked it because it was closest to my job, so after work hopped in the car called to order  1/2 dozen of Red Pork Tamales, they said 20 minutes got there 25 minutes but had to wait another 5 minutes.   Easy to find, 1st thing we notice parking kind of sucks had to park in the back, no back entrance. Open the door and a smell of bleach or cleaning products overwhelmed me I thought to myself I'm glad I ordered to go.  The smell could have been because there was a wishing pond with the virgin Mary, who knows.   Staff was nice, we ordered a bag of chips to.  The chips where a little stale, boo. The Tamales well I LOVED the Masa, the flavor is Yumlicious... Not to hard, not to soft. It's red in coloring. The size was pretty decent, nice and big. Even amount of Masa and Meat which I loved. The meat on the other hand well was dry and didn't have much sauce all the sauce is in the masa. They have kick to them, but a nice kick. You feel the heat after eating a few bites. They come with sauce on the side, nice and thick sauce, good flavor. I poured it over the Tamale and yet still had dry meat.   Overall I was happy and satisfied with my Tamale.  I was thinking maybe they are not fresh that's why the meat was dry, but that's okay it did the job.  I would say give it a try.    On a scale from 1-5  Masa 5 Meat 3 Size 5 Sauce 4 Chips 2  While I was there I saw they won for best Menudo a few years ago, so I will be back for that....  ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` I ordered 1 Red Menudo for the hubby and 1 White one for me to go of course.    I was surprised on how they packed it very well in a plastic container so no way that was spilling all over my car like before from other places.    It came with all the fixings, crushed red peppers, oregano, cilantro, Green Onions and White Onions all in sparte on containers which I loved. Oh yea and lemons of course.. I'm from Los Angeles and they never gave Menudo with Lemons only Limes and it was VERY hard to find white  Menudo but not here in Arizona which I love.   I noticed the harmony was at the bottom of both containers than the tripes. I'm more of a harmoy girl so I had to transfer the tripes in a seprate bowl then add the harmony juice than tripes... The Tripes was not to thick but was cut in big squares.   They both had different flavors and they both were greasy, especially the red one. To greasy for me, but it did the trick. The red one was not spicy at all and is good for those who don't like spice as for me I need my spice. The white didn't quite have the menudo taste I tasted the tripe and that's all. The harmony had seeds which I'm not use to but tasted good.   So overall on a scale to 1 -5 I give the  white menudo 3 red menudo 3   But I'm not done with this place now I got to try a combo plate but I hear they are known for their Chimecungas must try that too. So see you next time.",

It was a Sunday morning, we got there around 11 am and were quite hungry. I get places get busy and that was fine, the wait was only about 20 mins and were seated quite fast. Unfortunately it took almost 15 mins to be even asked what we wanted to drink in which after we got it fast and entered our order with the waitress. We ended killing the first basket of chips and salsa and a second one came and we noticed that almost 45 mins had passed and we still did not receive our dishes. My sister went to go ask and the lady at the register stated she noticed us twice and asked our waitress twice but to no avail, we canceled our orders and left. To be honest, not the \"best\" spot like I read. Sub par menu like any other and with service like that I'll not be visiting this place again.",

The salsa was okay.   The food I ordered had no flavor and it was extremely dry. I added lemon, guac, salt, and lots of salsa to my burrito and even then I was finsing it hard to swallow the dry meat.   The portions were great especially for the prices. Unfortunately was missing flavor. And may I also add, the food is authentic to an extent. Yeah they have some actual Mexican dishes but they're not that authentic. Lots of their dishes are paired up with french fries.   Wish I could of tried some of their drinks but seemed all they had were beers at the time.   I don't think I'd eat here again.

    "text": "The food is and always be the star of the show at Rositas Place! The red chile beef consists of large pieces of beef, stewed with red chilies (probably dried) until super tender. Easy enough to smash with your fork while eating. The red chili burro (which is huge!) is somewhere around $8 if memory serves me correctly so I always have them make it enchilada style: slathered in delicious red enchilada sauce and cheese then passed through the oven. Authentic sonoran flavors? YES!   The red and green salsa that comes out with the freshly fried corn tortilla chips upon sitting down is also amazing. I swear, if no one were looking I could drink that stuff! Both are an excellent topping for the carne machaca tacos: shredded beef cooked with peppers, onions and tomatoes.  Another favorite part of Rosita's place for myself is the ambience. I've been eating here for over 15 years, and I don't think it's changed a single bit, probably since its existence. When I walk in, I feel like I'm at home. A couple of the lovely older waitresses have been here for quite some time and they totally remind me of the parents of good friends growing up, and its not suprising to be addressed as \"mijo\" or \"mija\"... Being that I no longer live in the southwest, whenever I'm in Phoenix, Rositas Place in an absolute must stop while in town...without a doubt!",

    "text": "This place has been a favorite spot for my entire family for 27 years now. The family favorite dish here has always been the green corn tamales with super spicy jalapeno green chilies on top. Other favorites include the cheese enchiladas with green sauce, chicken and beef fajitas, soft tacos, beans and rice w/most dinner orders. Flan for desert. Freshly fried up chips and the spiciest salsa both red and green. If you're into very spicy mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. Truly a cornerstone of traditional PHX mexican food. Delicious!",

The tacos were \"ground beef\" which I didn't mind until it looked like the nasty consistency of baby food mixed with whatever Jack in the box puts in the tacos. My husband ordered a bean chimichanga and the beans were so bland and the tortilla was soggy and not crispy at all. The rice was super bland and had no flavor. The salsa was weird. It had a strange smokiness to it which I wasn't expecting. Even the chips was bland! I'm not sure what the heck was going on tonight as my husband and I chose this restaurant to try based on Yelp reviews and pictures posted. The food was so bad that I can't even go back and give it another chance.",

    "text": "Disappointing.  We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.  Not horrible but not particularly good either.  On a Friday night at 7:30, it was less than half full. The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.  The food was all over the place.  Salsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.  Chips - fresh, but greasy.  Chicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.  Steak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.  Beans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.  Guacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?    Mariachis - insistent and annoying.  And a bit much for a place like this really.  $35 with two cheap drinks and a totally unwarranted tip.",

    "text": "There aren't a ton of restaurants and are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL.  This is one and, dare I say, is the best mexican food in AZ.  I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.  Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.  The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.  Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.  She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.  Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW  The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.  Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.  If I eat the whole thing for lunch.  I don't eat dinner.  There are only a couple places that really deliver every time like Rosita's does.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM  DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE!!",

My wife orderd the the Mexican platter, asked for NO cheese,  she got it WITH  cheese, and the meat was as chewy as if you chewed on your shoe sole.. i order the machaca chimmichanga,  WITH rice and beans, got no rice and beans,  again,  the meat thought flavorful,  was very tough. To add insult to injury,  the waitress was very rude,  didn't show up to ask if all okay,  totally ignoring us and turned her back to us just so she can ignore our gestures to capture her attention.

But I really wanted the menudo I came for so I patiently waited. That and the service was not good. The server barely came around or not at all to check on us. We didn't speak Spanish but that's all they really tried talking to us in. I could understand some but my english responses were still answered in spanish. I thought that was pretty funny.

I've experienced better\" fits perfectly. I was so excited to come eat here :( Like Los Compadres it had been on the list for a long time. A 4 star Mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet. This place also showed up on Chow Bella a few days ago. I was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured I was in for meh service based on what I read. Seems like I received the complete 180 of an experience.  Got there about 7:30 Saturday night. The place was 65% capacity at most. This surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup. Figured I was doomed for a night of waiting. We were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5. She quickly returned with some HUGE glasses of water an a basket of chips. I was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips I had read so much about. What I got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them. I'm a good sport so I tried one of the greasy ones and all I could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way.. Blech :(  The salsa however was very tasty. The red was far from burning hot that I had read so much about. It was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things I would eat all evening. The green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well.  We ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly. We were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up.  Food Details:  Guacamole: Very simple prep here. Avocado, Onion, Salt and 800lbs of tomatoes. I absolutely HATE fresh tomatoes but that's just a personal preference. The quac was fresh and tasty. There was nothing \"wrong\" with it there's just much better at countless places.  Rice: So far from exciting I don't specifically recall. I just remember having a bite and moving on. Was a little greasy and bland :/  Beans: Just went I thought dinner was a complete waste I took a few bites of these and WOW! some of the best beans I've ever had. Pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares. The texture was perfect.. the flavor was perfect.. I could have been satisfied with a side of quac, couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans. Half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans. I'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean.  Cheese Crisp: No real crisp at all. Just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease.  Green Chili Tamale: The texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy. This was another \"not bad but far from great\" items.  Ground Beef Taco: The shell was nice and crispy and didn't taco fail. The meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor.  Chili Relleno: Oh man.. I've been trying to figure this one out. Terrible is the only word I have for it. There were two of them on the table and they were both the same. The batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that. They weren't greasy.. they were watery. I'm nearly positive these were made in house, frozen, and heated to order. There's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way.  Enchilada: Suffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce. Don't get me wrong.. I like cheese but it was 10% red sauce and 90% cheese. I couldn't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good. The enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside. It was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that's how skimpy the filling was.  Red Sauce: Don't know.. there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it.  Could this have been an off night? I guess its possible but I order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item wasn't good that night. Is this the worst Mexican in town? Far from it.. But there are so many other great places I feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only Mexican stop when they have a craving. They are missing out on some real good food out there.",

The beans too! Mmm! I know many friends and family who frequent Rosita's. If you're in a hurry go to a chain but for me, I'd rather wait for my Rosita's.

The chips here are the best for sure.  Simple, delicious red and green salsas.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Thanks yelpers, following advice of others is not always good.  This place was a big let down. I was excited for a minute when I saw a full parking lot and small crowd inside but once the food arrived all I can do is smh.  The horchata was decent but that was the only positive about this meal unfortunately. The service was also non existent, not attentive or nice at all which made the experience even worse.  We did get tortilla chips but the salsa was so fricken spicy none of us could eat it, what a waste. The kids ordered tacos that were inedible, we ordered a soft taco but got a hard one instead and the other kid ordered fish tacos that were so spicy he couldn't eat them at all.  And the waitress took the order directly from them so how do you screw those up, kids would not eat their tacos, does that make any sense?  How hard is it to screw up a taco?  Me and my other companion both ordered chicken chimichangas that were crunchy and delish looking on the outside but one bite and We were both disgusted. All dark meat, no flavor, super dry and unseasoned meat, no kind of sauce inside or out, cheese not even melted on top. I will say that the avocado thrown on the side was good but unfortunately it didn't make up for the bad meal. The beans are cooked in lard with no vegetarian alternative so all you vegans don't bother coming here. Anyways, first time leaving a restaurant with full plates that none of us finished or taken home as left overs. And sell hungry but will opt out of Yelp for dinner tonight. Still fuming over such a dreadful lunch.",

The restaurant is a bit odd, with the waitresses wearing little costumes (I am surprised this is still a thing anywhere). The food, however was pretty tasty. I tried the horchata with booze... very sweet and delicious. Their margs are fairly standard, but large. For food, I had their wonderfully delicious cheese crisp (and trust me, I've had some bad cheese crisps elsewhere, it is possible) and a combo which included a taco and an enchilada. The taco was nothing special, but the enchiladas were tasty and had a nice spicy sauce on top. Portions were large and prices were small, can't complain about that. My friend got the carnitas burrito, which she didn't really love ( I didn't try it, so I can't really comment). I would definitely return here.",

Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging. Salty, spicy hot, warm, crunch.  The mole here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole. Seriously that good. The margaritas are stiff and delish. This place is here for the food, not the service ... though the service has always been great.    This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind.

Still cannot get over them not offering bread(bolillo) with your menudo, don't know any other place that doesn't have bread but I've learned to get over it a little and just order a flour tortilla. Also, if you love A LOT of lemon on your menudo I suggest you bring your own small bottle of lemon juice, the wedges they offer are super small and you get very little lemon and a lot of mess from trying to squeeze every last drop. Oh, and the salsa that they serve with chips is REALLY hot and sometimes inedable for my taste. Other than that, you learn to live with the above in lieu of good mexican food, definitely my second favorite place for authenic dine in mexican food and first favorite for menudo. Large menu selection and everything is good. I suggest you come as soon as they open to avoid long waiting times because the dining area is a bit small and cramped. Enjoy!",

Where else do you get salty, spicy hot, cool, and crunch in one seating? The peach margarita definitely will make AZ's hot temps bearable without sacrificing the alcohol content like most frozen drinks. Besides, the more you have their homemade chips and salsa, you would want a pitcher of that concoction. The carnitas were different than I expected; partly because I didn't realize I would get a hunk of meat to configure my own burrito! The machaca was hands down the center stager of oohhaahh! And not to mention, I wanted to steal our service - happy, fun and all about making us happy!",

Went there Sunday for dinner at 5pm with my family from out of town and they were out of a lot of things on the menu. So you'd think they must be good right? WRONG! Waitress was rude and short with us while smacking her gum. We asked for coke and she didn't even bother to let us know they only had Pepsi. (THEY AREN'T THE SAME!!!) I never got my water. Take a good look at your bill because they over charge any chance they get!! My mom ordered a bean, rice and cheese burrito and they charged us $9.85. REALLY? And they forgot about the rice so they gave it to her on the side and asked is that ok after they brought it out. My sister and dad ordered the green chile with beef and both left most of it. I ordered the 2 hard shell chicken tacos with rice and beans, the shells were soft and oily from being under cooked. Rice wasn't good. I had chicken nerves in my taco and the chicken alone didn't taste good without the lettuce and cheese. My niece ordered fries and they were burned. No kids menu so my 8 year old niece ordered from the regular menu and left most of it since she's a kid and doesn't eat that much. Anyway, last time we go there. Only thing good was the beer.  The only reason we left tip was because they charged it since there were 7 of  us. Never again!",

My friend ordered a lemonade and I had a taste and it was delicious she thought it was a bit sour though. They also offered us salsa and chips and we of course said yes. The chips were warm so I can tell they made them there they were delish! The salsas were a little bland and lacked some seasoning.

If you're looking for Authentic tasting, home cooked Mexican food.. this is your spot!  The enchiladas are bomb! Especially the green chili sauce !! They are a MUST try!! And the beans and rice are very delicious as well!! Beans are like nana makes and the rice is perfect flavor! I'm picky about my rice! Haha  When you dine in, the chips aren't free but a must! They're made fresh!! And smell soooooo GOOD! Only a dollar for a huge hot fresh basket! I believe free refills on them too. So a one time charge. They only have hot sauce (I believe.. i nvr asked lol) but both red and green! They're both pretty spicy too !! Like almost no joke on the level of spicy!! I thought I could handle spicy but these are almost not tolerable for me. I think my taste buds have changed with age lol anyways they taste good, but beware of the spicyness! I do wish they had a chunky type of salsa! That's one downside for me.. I love chunky salsa!!   The chips and salsa are usually a deal breaker for me when I decide whether I like to go back to a Mexican restaurant and although I don't LOVE the hot sauce/salsa, the chips and the food are too good not to go back! So good I take a trip from west Phoenix to east Phoenix!  The chicken tacos are good and chicken enchiladas but I still would go with the green chili cheese enchiladas as my FAVORITE and a must try!!  I've tasted the red menudo ( only ate the hominy) and id say give it a go if your in the mood!! I think it's even rated best in phx! (As what I seen advertised in the restaurant) my dad and mom both loved it!  This spot might not look like somewhere you would think to stop in to, given the location and side of town, but DO IT!! Great portions! Very decent prices!! And Great tasting AUTHENTIC, HOME COOKED Mexican food!! I'd say one of the BEST in Phoenix!! And I'm a picky eater!",

    "text": "Was looking online for good enchiladas as that is what the bun in the oven was craving. Rosita's Place came up and is close to home so we decided to give them a try. The service was impeccable, we had one waitress ask our drink order as soon as she left another waitress came to ask if we needed drinks or were ready to order! The chips and salsa while we waited for our food was phenomenal the green one is super spicy done let the color fool you but spicy and flavorful both the red and green salsa were to die for so good!!! The chips were fresh. The establishment was clean and very inviting. I ordered one cheese and one chicken enchilada with rice and beans. The enchilada sauce was incredible everything was cooked perfect and tasted amazing. My better half had the chili verde with rice and beans which I wish I would have got that but he let me have some of his. We were too full for dessert but I don't really have a sweet tooth lately. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. I will eat here again only downside (not really downside if you are into it, stuff my teenager listens to) was there was a jukebox that had current rap music playing on it throughout the restaurant. Also the exit is a tight fit so if you have a large vehicle good luck getting in for parking cross your fingers getting out.",

    "text": "Come here only if you want to leave with a distaste. The horrible service, lack of attention and UNAUTHORIZED CHARGING OF AN UNAGREED AMOUNT TO PAY is unacceptable. I have came here a handful of times so this review comes after enough experience of dealing with these people. THE FOOD IS GOOD BUT IT CANNOT MAKE UP FOR THE HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FRAUD! For whatever reason, the servers that my party and I haven gotten lack attention, common sense and good service/ attitudes. The most recent and last time I came on a Saturday, 06/15/19 around 3:30 pm to be exact- I brought my first timer little sister and my boyfriend who's been here and experienced all the drama with me before. This day my sister and I both wanted flautas but I wasn't too hungry and only wanted the order of 2 flautas and my sister orders the combination plate. UPON ORDERING I specifically asked the server \"does the flautas come with CHEESE and sour cream?\" She responded \"yes it comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole\", I then added \"my sister wants a combination plate, I will have the 2 flautas, NOT THE COMBINATION PLATE\". So I specifically gave details of our orders and asked specific questions for this women. When are food arrives, there is no cheese on either dish and both were combination plates. Before we could even mention it, the server speedily took off elsewhere and  It took 5 minute or more until she came to attend us. It was a very slow hour that we came during so I don't see any excuse as to why it took so long. Nonetheless, I bring the facts of the matter to her attention, there's no cheese on either dish and I specifically ordered 2 flautas for mysely. She insisted I take the rice and beans and that it would only be a $1-$2 more if I went with the combination plate. The money wasn't the point, the waste of food was. I told her no I still didn't want it and rather than apologize for her mistake she got a really bad attitude and went off saying \"well the cheese is extra and if you don't want the beans and rice don't touch them and I won't charge you for them.\" I was in shock.. for an establishment to make a mistake and rather than fixing it, make it worse and on top of that I was DISGUSTED because all I could think is they're going to reuse these beans and rice. Me being me, I matched her Petty attitude and gave it right back. She didn't like it. and the fact that she threw the whole \"cheese is extra\" and DID CHARGE me extra for it is not okay because like I said, I specifically asked if the plates come with cheese, she said yes then I bring that up along with the cashier so I don't get charged and she had the rude audacity to reply \"it says it on the menu\" BUT I ASKED YOU SO YOU BEING AN EMPLOYEE OF THE RESTAURANT AND KNOWING THE MENU SHOILD ADVISE THE PAYING CUSTOMERS SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR! Now days later, I checked my online banking and seen they charged my card for an unauthorized amount for $3 OVER the amount I agreed to pay, and for no reason bc even though that server didn't even deserve a penny, out of karamic responsibility I Still was kind enough to give her $3 for a $30.70 tab which is nearly 10%, again that she DID NOT DESERVE. I called my bank and got the full amount back because what they did was illegitimate. A lot of people come to me on social media platforms for local businesses I'd recommend and Rosita's Place will not be one of them. Bye Felicia's.",

The hubby and I ordered chips, guacamole, jamaica beverages, and a posole for each. The guacamole was delicious and I do appreciate that they give you very large drink portions (which I never finish but my husband usually does). However, the chips were a little too greasy and the jamaica was way too sweet. The posole was spicy and it lacked flavor but the pork was tender and really good. I like that they give you lots of lemons and tortillas. Unfortunately, my husband ended up with an upset stomach after we got home and we both think it was something he ate here (only time it has happened after eating here). I myself didn't feel all that great after my meal. We'll probably return to give it another try but will I will definitely just stick to the menudo.",

Saturday lunchtime was very busy and we had to wait over 20 to 25 minutes for a table for 5. Nothing impressive on the menu that was outstanding to me and the salsas both red and green we're too hot. I ordered the green chili tamales plate and was not impressed. The tamales were too big and doughy with a strange, barely there filling that clearly was not green chili. My hubby had a chicken chimichanga that was huge but again nothing unique or impressive. And the guacamole that came on top of it turned completely black by the time we got home afterwards yuck!  How long has That been sitting out!? I didn't get to ask everybody in our party how they enjoyed their food, but one other friend of ours was equally not impressed either and thought the beef tacos he ordered were no better than a fast food restaurant. Not a fan and probably won't be back!",

That definitely tells you they're doing something right when i usually go i tend to order a bean burrito enchilada style red with a side of rice and beans the beans are to die for creamy and cheesy and the enchilada sauce even makes it better oh also the menudo red and white is superb with all the trimmings i prefer the white and i add some of the red salsa to give it a kick they have so many things to chose from you can't beat tacos,burritos,Chile rellenos, soups(pozole menudo(Served everyday by the way) there is so much more of and they have some of the best margaritas made with fresh squeezed lime so give them a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed just beware they tend to get lines out the door on Sunday's but they do take reservations good luck!",

I tried the Red while my girlfriend had the white and they both tasted pretty damn good.  Aside from that I had a taco and enchilada combo too and that was pretty decent.  The ground beef in the taco was mixed with potato which gave it an interesting consistency, good yes but different.   I'd definitely come back and try the rest of the menu and maybe one of them supersize margaritas I see around flowing around me.    My only negative review I would say is they should definitely have the toilets checked out, I didn't lay anything major but it didn't wanna flush. Also the water tasted like it was freshly from Mexico, maybe it boosted the food a bit but it didn't quench my thirst.",

You can't substitute items with combo platter choices, so that wasn't so nice. I ordered a 2-ground beef taco platter.  I was expecting ground beef.  But instead the taco meat was a patty composed of potato, fried beans, and a little meat.  It was different, but it didn't taste good.  The menu should tell you that the taco meat was like that.

I ordered a completely different dish and my review remains the same, just average. The fresh chips were great but they also charge you for them so I expect them to be better than the complimentry ones you receive at your typical mexican joint.",

Upon entering I was greeted by a young man who greeted me and seated me rather promptly. My waiter came within five minutes and brought chips and salsa! I ordered the Chimichanga and a michelada. WOW! The meat was seasoned perfectly, not too much like some places and the frying was good, no excessive oil. I will definitely come back!  Give it a try if you desire REAL Mexican food!",

In all honesty I was planning to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...  You park behind the restaurant and walk around the front, dodging a few cars along the way. Walking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm. The service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a good way. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good). They arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer).  Once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!! The flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!  I'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix.",

The sign says \"Please wait to be seated\", the place wasn't all that busy yet we stood there ignored for about 5 minutes before we were told to seat ourselves.  Once seated, we were brought chips which were hot and fresh but we didn't get any salsa to eat with the chips until we'd finished about half the serving.  I ordered the carne asada taco combo plate. The rice and beans were ok, but my carne asada was very similar to whatever Jack in the Box fills their 99 cent tacos with. Whatever it was, it had less flavor than the Jack in the Box tacos and cost much more. My carne asada didn't resemble meat at all.  The food sucked and the service was substandard, I will not return.",

I bought a couple little things and then I asked the people there where they would eat. The one woman sent me here.  The atmosphere is okay. There's a fountain that Kids might like.

The red salsa is far too hot for me. However, anybody reading my reviews knows I'm a little wussy in that area. The pico de gallo was perfectly hot so no problems there.

Meanwhile, I was introduced to a wonderful new option here in the valley which happens to be close to my office. Thank the Lord for Rosita's Place!  When I say \"new\", I mean it's new to me. But Rosita's Place has been hiding near 24th Street and the 202 since the '60's. And the parking, although abundant, is hiding behind the building. It's easy to miss the narrow driveway to the rear parking lot which is smack up against the west wall of the restaurant.  Once inside, you will be greeted by decor and charm that is classic Arizona and hard to replicate in a new restaurant. And wait until you see the huge bowl of freshly cooked chips that will be on the table soon. The chips come with a green (hot) and red (hotter) salsa and both are outstanding!  The menu is extensive. So much so, that I need to make a return trip to size it up. But I did find an entree that caught my eye. I chose the Mixed Plate which included a red and green Chile. The beans and rice are stunning and clearly made from scratch. And the portion (served on the hottest plate I've seen in years) was more than generous. I had plenty of delicious leftovers for the next day.  Rosita's Place is outstanding! I've already talked about it at work and to friends. Most have heard of it, but hadn't tried it yet. Clearly, I will be back with others in tow. Thank the Lord for Rosita's Place!",

Mine was good.  Very flavorful. While I prefer mine to be just the shredded beef, this was more of a shredded beef braised in a sauce with some veggies.  It was good though! Chicken prepared in a similar fashion.  Both came with rice and beans. Those sides were tasty. Everything was authentic tasting.    Meals served with fresh made chips and both red and green salsa. I had to hide the chips behind a menu so I wouldn't go overboard.  That strategy sort of worked.    Very clean.  Extremely well decorated.  Super friendly staff.

Rosita's Place is like that. It reminds me of why I moved to this city almost half a century ago. As you walk in a hand laid up stone fish pond greets youth the left, the bar is straight back. We only had a cheese crisp so I guess I'm reviewing character here more than food quality. But one can tell a lot about the taste of the hot sauces, and the familiar feeling you get. Phoenix Mexican Cuisine is different from TexMex or Northern California or even New Mexico and it's my favorite! So if you love classic Phoenix style Mexican food and you're anywhere near 2310 E McDowel- drop in!",

    "text": "All the great reviews are what brought me here on a weekday work lunch. Since I take late lunches, there was no wait to be seated so that was awesome. Like many Mexican places in the area, chips and salsa are complimentary. The chips were actually pretty good and freshly made.   For our entrees, we got 2 combinations of chicken tacos w/ rice & beans and beef tacos w/ rice & beans. They were honestly just okay and mediocre. Upon arrival of our food, we were surprised to see that they came with hardshell tacos instead of the soft tacos we were craving. We later realized that the server should've asked us which one we wanted and she must've just forgotten, but we just let it go and ate our food. My chicken was bland, so I asked for lime (they didn't have it so they gave me lemons instead, which was fine) to add to the flavor. Even with those efforts, I unfortunately could not enjoy my food.  When we were ready to go, we couldn't find our server (or anyone, really) so we can get the check. It turns out that everyone was on lunch/break. I understand employee breaks, but I think it would've been considerate and a good business practice to have at least one person on the floor checking on customers, instead of everyone just disappearing. We spent about 5 mins trying to hunt someone down so we could get our check and go. I think I'd also be more forgiving had our server been friendly, but every interaction with her just felt like she was ready to get rid of us.  I'm not sure if Rosita's just had a bad afternoon when I went, but I will honestly probably not come back here out of my own free will unless I'm invited here by someone else.",

We've always had to have our food boxed up soon after it finally arrived.  I also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention.  The food was okay, but they're very heavy on the sauce and cheese.  My chicken enchilada was decent, but didn't blow me away, despite the \"most authentic\" praise others waxed about this place.  I also don't think the koi pool (it's not made to look like a rocky pond or anything natural) is very sanitary, so I'm subtracting a star for that.  It really should be an enclosed aquarium when it's right in the middle of a restaurant like that.  I'd go back with coworkers if this was where they wanted to go, but as for myself, I am sticking to Los Tacquitos.",

Wow, when my girlfriend was really sick a few weeks ago her close friend took us Rositas for some spicey healing food. Chips and salsa were really good. Fresh hot chips,that they make right there in store. Along with 2 delish salsas. We got the best Chicken soup I have ever had in my life. Yes, better than my Mothers. But, do not tell her. I don't want to hurt her feelings.  Each of our soups had a full chicken breast inside. The broth was amazing. Our meal was amazing and more than I could eat.  By that night my girlfriend felt like a new person, it really was the healing food. Recently I stopped in a little short of time and got an order to go. Again fantastic ,hot ,delish food. The ladies that work there are so sweet as well! This is so good and so inexspensive as well. I sort of hate to share my new find,because, it will get really busy and I won't find a seat.

It then took about five minutes to be acknowledged by a server and a drink order taken. Five minutes later she comes back with the drinks and takes our order. She brought out salsa with the drinks but no chips. I asked about them and she said they'll be right out. It took about another 15 minutes to get the chips. The chips and salsa were very good, not the best, but well above average. The food followed about another 15-20 minutes after the chips.  I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style which was excellent. My daughter got a machaca taco with beans and rice. My daughter didn't like the machaca, which I tried and figured out it was really carne seca. The waitress noticed my daughter didn't like it and I pointed out it was carne seca and not machaca. She apologized and removed it from the bill, which redeemed her some. My daughter ended up having some of my carne asada.  The ambiance is divey and it wasn't very clean, but not unhealthy clean.  I probably wouldn't go back if in the area again, but mostly due to the bad service.",

Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful.  Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best I've had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.

But in case you don't,  and for anybody else, here's the deal: this is the place you go to when you want a fun atmosphere, authentic Mexican food and enough of it to knock you stupid for about 5 hours. I live down the street from Rosita's, and there are more great Mexican food spots around here than I can count on all four hands. A lot of them can have you in and out with a great meal to go in no time, which is great for me because I generally don't like being around too many people when I eat. But I absolutely LOVE eating at Rosita's. Something about the awesome decor, the diverse clientele, the amazing food, and the servers who are either sweet as candy or surly with hearts of gold. It all comes together in a perfect package, and I keep coming back to eat there even when it might be easier to get something on the go.  Recommendations: chicken mole, mixed plate, carnitas plate. Also everything else.",

It use to be that I would only go to Rosita once a year because I didn't care for the service over the years. Since then I have been back on a number of occasions and the service was great! The food was always great and now the service matches! My rating would be 5 stars for food always, and now 5 stars for service! It's a great place to be!",

The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't worth the drive either.  My favorite places in the Valley are Manuel's or Ajo Al's so I often compare other mexican food places against those two.  Despite its authenticity, Rosita's did not make it over the Ajo Al's hump, I hate to say.    One word to the wise and/or time-sensitive types:  this place takes its time when it comes to service.  I would stay clear of Rosita's if you are in a hurry, because getting the bill, alone, took close to half an hour.  Our waitress virtually disappeared during this process and the other two (yes, two) people who helped us with our bill also took their sweet time.",

Unless I'm headed over to my mom's for dinner, my quest for food familiar to my taste buds has pretty much been a bust.  Although it's kind of weird to have a bunch of koi fish in a too-shallow, too-small space right when you walk in, that (and the fact that Rosita's is, indeed, in a sketchy part of town) is the only detraction.  The food isn't New Mexican, but it is yummy. I've eaten here several times. The tacos are okay. The chicken flautas come loaded with tons of sour cream and guacamole.  A friend of mine says that you can tell the quality of a place by their rice and beans, and Rosita's doesn't disappoint.  Where Rosita's shines, though, is in its soups and green chile meat dishes. Go starting in October for the best posole. Or order the green chile burrito, enchilada style. The chile isn't for wimps, and the meat is tender and melts in your mouth.",

We have a lot of good Mexican and Tex Mex places in Dallas and I still rate this highly. I recommend either the chicken burrito or if you are up for it, the chicken chimichanga. There is something about how they make the chicken there that is the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. They don't put anything but meat in the burritos, so get them with the green chile sauce and definitely order it \"enchilada\" style (melted cheese). The refried beans are great too. Others I've gone with love the pork carnitas.",

So I found in several articles and sites as well as Yelp that Rositas had the best Chile Verde. So I  got done with work early one night so I made my way to Rositas. It has an interesting parking lot, not really near anything, more of a neighborhood or lunch place. I order the mixed plate (half red, half green chile) rice, beans, chips and salsa, and a drink for $10!!!  The red chile and the rice was very good...the green chile the best I ever had!!! Very clean, very good service.  I enjoyed it so much a few nights ago I managed to squeeze it in before I caught my flight back home...this time, all green chile dinner!!!

The place was packed & we had a party of eight people. I thought we would have to wait forever. We didn't have to wait long though. They had a big party room in the back and they put us in there so we didn't have to wait. Thank God for a restaurant that was willing to be helpful! I was freezing because the A/C was cranking, but everyone else thought it was great. I think anything below 74 degrees it too cold, so my perception could be a bit off.  The waitress brought us super hot and delicious chips right away. We had our drinks in a few minutes, and she took our orders right away. I was crabby since I was starving, and I was stoked to be scarfing down those chips!   She took our orders right away and the food was out to us pretty quickly. I had pretty great enchiladas, rice and beans. Everyone else was really happy with their food too. I ate more than I usually do because it was really good, and as a result, I am still full six hours later.  Great food and service, I can't complain. I haven't tried the margaritas here yet, so I can't fully evaluate, but so far so good.  I'll do an update once I've boozed it up here as well!",

My father used to tease me that I was \"born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;\" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.  From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their \"new\" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends.   The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.  Maybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!",

Our server then brought a round of refils and the check and we didn't see her for the rest of the night!   I did enjoy my dinner, the food was better than good. I had menudo, which wasn't anything great. I've had much better menudo on the rez! OH! and they didn't have any cilantro!! I was shocked! so my menudo lacked soul. :( I got a side order of beef  taco which was good. :) I liked it.   The salsa is KILLER!! I kept trying to eat it so I'd get used to it... no such luck! But it definatly released the endorphans! And cleared my sinuses... and brought a little water to my eyes! And that says a lot, cuz I can handle a lot of hot food!  Over all, I dig the food, the place was very colorful and festive. Which is always a plus. I could do without the mariachi band. oh DUDE! the band almost got into a fight with one of the patrons!! The patron was all drunk and kept requesting songs, and I guess he didn't know it was $3 a song, so they wanted their money, he didn't have any and that's when things got U-G-L-Y!! It was funny cuz the guy was drunk but yeah - it's $3 a song! But yeah, I dig that rough environment.   I honestly think it was an isolated incident, overall it was a nice place.

I will agree and state that it is totally worth the wait - I had two enchiladas in red suace - one machaca and one pollo.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them to anyone.  It is slightly annoying that the chips have a cost, but seriously it's just a buck!  The salsa totally makes it worth it as well - I think the red salsa there is some of the best I've had in recent times.  The atmosphere was great.  There was a little cantina towards the back and the place was a lot bigger and nicer than I was expecting.  That pesky service is the only thing that keeps Rosita's from making the leap to great from good.  As I said, if you head in assuming things may take a while, not so bad; but I could see that becoming a problem in time-sensitive situations like lunch.  One last quick tip - they don't split the bill, so make sure people in your party have cash or owe money to the person who ends up paying with the card.",

I agree that the service was not world class, but the portions were generous and the food was delicious. As seen on other reviews for Rosita's, both the green and red salsas packed a heck of a kick. Unfettered, I ordered the Camarones a Diablo (Devil's Shrimp). It came after a longer than average wait, and it was a spicy, tasty meal.

    "text": "First time trying this place after reading all of the great reviews. There's great parking in the back. As you enter, it's a little small but we were greeted by every employee we encountered as we walked in. Our waitress arrived immediately to our table and asked if we would like chips with salsa and took our drink orders. She patiently checked back to take our food order. I ordered a green chile chimichanga, my friends both ordered the red chile chimichanga with rice and beans. The red salsa was good, not spicy, the green salsa had a kick. Both were good as were the chips. My chimichanga was average size topped with sour cream & guacamole- the green chile was flavorful, lots of meat. I just wish it would have had a little more chile sauce, but it was very good. Price was fair. The restaurant looked clean, our order came out quick and our service was great. Will return to try something else.",

The chips were a little stale, but that's par for the course for most Mexican restaurants.    The waitress we had this past visit was amazing. She was engaging, but not intrusive. Our drinks were always full, and she even offered \"To Go\" drinks...   My mother and I were catching up after a while, a she didn't chase us out of the booth, and even continue to offer refills on our iced Tea after we closed out the tab.   One of these days, my husband and I should split something, so we have room for desert because I saw a plate of fried Ice cream walk by, and it looked delicious.",

The first time, it took forever for the waitress to come over once we were seated. After what seemed like forever we finally got some chips and salsa and then the waitress finally appeared. My son's order came out way before mine, so far in advance that he was done eating when mine arrived. Once I finally got my enchilada and beans, the beans were cold and the cheese was not even melted in the enchilada and I had to send it back! Again, can't find the waitress and getting front of house is almost impossible! Finally the food was sent back, by the time it came back again, my son really wanted to go home, and quite frankly so did I!   My dad said to give them another try.... I did.   The second time my daughter really wanted to go for her birthday. Once seated, it took forever to get service. Finally someone brought salsa and chips, then a huge long wait for the waitress to come to the table. When the waitress finally came, our order was taken and it took over 20 minutes to get our drinks! When the food finally came out, the beef in the chimichangas was tough, I had to ask for the side of sour cream and guacamole over 3 times before it was brought out, the guacamole had zero flavor, worst meal ever! We needed refills on the drinks and chips, again good luck getting service from your waitress or the front of house. I asked 3 different people for boxes to go, that took over 15 minutes to get! Took another 15 minutes after that just to get the bill! When I got home, I fed the leftovers to the chickens!   After this, I was never going back!   Dad just drove in from CA and the first place he wanted to go was here... I told him it would be a mistake... it was!  Again, hard to get service. There are about 10 tables and 4 waitresses! We placed our order, waited so long for our drinks that the basket of chips was almost gone before they arrived. Dad had the chile rellenos with a side of beans w/enchilada sauce and corn tortillas, I had a cheese enchilada w/beans and a side of sour cream. The chile rellenos were a mish mash of peppers and no cheese in sight, they did not put the enchilada sauce on the plate, forgot the sour cream, the beans were horribly over salted and did not bring the corn tortillas until the meal was almost done. Tried to get someones attention, anyone's attention to get a to go box! We left w/o the box.   This was a different waitress each time I went. I am so disappointed that customer service from the waitresses and front of house is non existent, so not customer friendly anymore! The food is also not what it use to be either!   Dad said I was right! We will never be going back!",

Just a suggestion, for a Popular business, I   Recommend it Wouldn't hurt to offer  customer if they would like a bottle. Instead of asking if they could fix it for me, the waitress asked if I would like more water?? Last time I checked beer was not water!!",

They were rushing us to order as soon as we said the first word of the order they interrupted us then asked the next person in our group. Also when we ordered the side of guacamole, and the waitress brought it over she went around the back side of our table and practically tossed it on the table. She didn't even bother saying excuse me or sorry. Oh my gosh and the quality of the food is horrible very very horrible our guacamole was old and brownish, it tasted awful. When we got out main dishes the carne Assad burrito was basically a giant asada taco no beans or rice inside nor onions and cilantro not even pico de gallo. Oh not to mention the chicharon burrito had a hair in it to top it off. We also ordered a carnitas burrito that was super dry I had to take a sip of my drink to even chew it. The asada burritos had no flavor at all. With my dish I had a hard shell taco which was supposed to be ground beef but it looked like something caned and that was smashed up. When we asked for cilantro,onions, and lime they brought us some old ass cilantro no onions and the lemons were old and brown. I have no idea how this place functions with poor quality food and service. Please do not waste your time and money here! The only good thing this place has to offer are the mints. Lol!",

They have a good egg and potato burro but I am not a fan of the whole menu, much like Los Dos is known for their pork roast and nothing else really, this place is all about the burro and posole. That isnt a bad thing when they deliver so well on them. Their rice and beans are pretty solid as well.",

    "text": "My husband and I wanted to try Rosita's place again we first tried Rosita's back in the 90s. So we looked at the menu and there was a lot of different choices but my husband really wanted to try and their red Menudo. I thought well I like menudo too so I would get a bowl also. We came in and there were a few tables available so we sat down and about 10 minutes later a huge party sat at the table behind us and it was incredible noisy. So we ended up moving and placed our order for two menudos with the pata (cow hoof). So our waitress brings us fresh fried chips red and green salsa. She brought out our Menudo but they were missing the pata  (cow hoof). So we ended up eating it was good but the Menudo really wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I don't care for HUGE amount of hominy. The bowl had about 80 per-cent hominy.  I think they serve menudo everyday so it seemed like it was on the stove for quite some time and was at a point where it was overcooked. The waitress was very nice considering the huge crowd that showed up she brought us the pata (cow hoof) in a separate Bowl which was very nice of her. Personally I would not come back specifically for menudo but would try another dish. And I always say if service is good that is good enough for me to return to try out another dish. I want to go back for tacos or enchiladas!  The fresh fried chips are so delicious!",

Our waitress was the same way, just a little too grouchy and maybe we were inconvenient. The food was okay, the cheese enchiladas were pretty standard but were sitting in a puddle of grease. I get it, Mexican food is generally greasy but this was a little overkill. I would have perhaps given the food another try in the future, but I'm pretty big on customer service so I'm not foreseeing another visit.",

    "text": "I went to Rosita's for lunch with a large group of coworkers. After hearing the praises sung about this place, I was ready to have \"real\" Mexican food (by my coworkers' definitions).   The location is small and not particularly tidy, but was seemed to be pretty legitimate, and we were happy to take the trip over.We started out with chips and salsa, red and green. The green was HOT, while the red was more mild, but they were both very flavorful. Our group of about 12 people was waited on by one woman, who did her best, but definitely could have used some help on a party that large.  We started with cheese crisp, which was new to me, and delicious! The cheese was hot and evenly melted, with a rich, buttery flavor. I added a little red salsa to give it a kick, and really enjoyed it!  We waited a LONG time to get our entrees (I would guess 45 minutes from the time the crisp was delivered), and I was accidentally given the wrong entree. I'd ordered a chicken burro, enchilada style, with rice, and received my boss' order of the same thing, but with beef. After cutting into it, I passed it to him and let the waitress know what I had ordered and that I hadn't received my food. 10 minutes later, she returned to our table with another burro (the one pictured) that was okay, but tasted a bit off... after examining it, I realized that it was pork... which I don't really care for. Not wanting to slow down an already-long lunch, I decided to just go ahead and eat the second burro, despite my not really caring for the meat.   All in all, I might be willing to give it another try, but the wait and receiving the wrong food twice were fairly off-putting. It would likely have been a better experience, had our table had an extra waitress, as my drink also sat empty for about a quarter of the meal with no server in sight. My fingers are crossed that next time, the experience is better. I was really looking forward to the meal, and it just didn't come out as good as I'd hoped it might.",

    "text": "We stopped here because it was on the way to the airport and boy did we luck out! Heard about it through yelp. The geography was right, the reviews were great,  so we thought let's give it a shot. Now if you're a fan of Mexican food from chain restaurants like manuel's or ajo al's, this is not the place for you. this is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Probably the best in the valley. I was a die-hard via delosantos fan and shouted from the rooftops about how great that place is. I will still say that. But there's a new numero uno on my list!   The green salsa is nice and spicy the way I like it. I don't like having to pay for chips. They should be complementary. But paying the $1 for these is worth it. They are fried to order so they come out crisp and hot. The guacamole is creamy with nice chunks of avocado throughout.   I ordered the chicharones because I was feeling adventurous and had never tried it before. Looking it up on Google described it as fried pork rinds so that's what I was expecting. Unfortunately I got soggy pieces of skin. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be. I don't know. The flavor wad good but the texture wasn't appealing. The menu also states that this dish is \"very hot.\" It was the complete opposite with hardly any spice to it at all. I won't be ordering that again. The bites I had of my nephew's carne asada chimichanga was to die for though!   Everyone raved about the beans here being the best ever... and they got it right! Delicious flavor. Probably made the authentic way with lard, but does it really matter at this point? I'm eating pig skin anyway!   Service was great! We were waited on by a lovely older Hispanic woman that has been there for over 20 years. She was so pleasant she kept bringing a smile to my face.   This is definitely my new favorite Mexican joint, not just for trips to and from the airport. It's worth driving down there just for rositas place :-)",

Honestly, sometimes I can tell when a different cook is in the kitchen, but my cheese enchiladas with the GREEN sauce was the old, wonderful recipe----you've got to order to green sauce.  The diner behind me was orgasmic about his dish, so I had to ask what he ordered:  STEAK PICADO; he gave me a sample and it was mighty tasty with intense heat.  As long as they can get that cheese enchilada right with the green sauce i will be forever devoted-------heck, if they served nothing but the unique green salsa and chips I'd dream about this food!  Don't go here for the tacos or the chimis, but stick with the enchiladas, or cheese crisp or steak picado.

Their red salsa is amazing and reminds me of the salsa I enjoyed growing up. I ordered 2 red sauce Cheese Enchiladas with rice and beans. It's not as good as NorCal Mexican food but pretty close. It's the best authentic Mexican food I've had in Phoenix! I would've given 5 stars but they didn't bring me my chips right away and brought them right before I got my food.",

    "text": "Pros:  Chips, salsas, beans, green chili, BIG tacos, great prices/value.  Cons:  Ground beef was mush, rice was meh.  Bottom line:    In my longstanding quest to find a go-to Mexican joint in central Phoenix, Rosita's emerges as a leading contender.     The chips are made fresh to order ($1 for a big basket) and go great with the salsas, and even better with a side of beans.  About the beans:  they're as good as advertised, with a salty/creamy (but not textureless) combo that's bliss.  Too bad the rice was so ordinary and bland.  But no one has big expectations for Mexican style rice, so only a small knock here.  The green chili burro ($5, additional $3 for beans and rice) is top notch, near Rito's in quality, but with a better construction.  Tender and spicy and not too soupy to soak through the tortilla.  Generous portion, too.   For kicks I also ordered a crunchy taco with ground beef and potato.  On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.  On the downside, the flavor and texture were very disappointing.  They blended the beef and potatoes together to make it a pasty mix.  Not appetizing at all.  My friend got a chicken taco and enchilada and said the chicken was particularly flavorful and tasted like it was braised, which is uncommon in a town where most Mexican places boil and shred their chicken.  The atmosphere inside is perfectly respectable for this kind of restaurant.  The neighborhood isn't great, but it's a well lit parking lot and there's an attendant watching the premises and the parking lot.  So there's that.",

It's not that the food is flat out bad, per se, it's just that there are many better options nearby. The first time I went on a recommendation, and the food was... OK. The 2nd time I went the food was still only... OK. The third time... well, you get the picture.  The first obvious knock against Rosita's Place is the chips and salsa. They're not bad, but they're not complimentary. Given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa, you'd think these would have to be pretty darn special, but they're not. Good, but not outstanding.  Secondly, the rice and beans are just OK (that descriptor keeps coming up in this review). The chicken enchiladas were fresh, but lacked any real flavor or spice. The machaca, which is supposed to be  one of their specialties, was soggy... a BIG no-no for a dish that is a specialty in this region.  So, honestly, while I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, I'm not sure what some of the hype is about, especially when Rito's, Tacos De Juarez, and Comedor Guadalajara aren't that far away.",

Seems like a simple thing.  A.  We waited for nearly 40 minutes before we even got our food.  B. The \"machaca\" was so inedible that I seriously thought I was being pranked.  The waitress never did bother to check on us at all after delivering our \"food\" so as I was starving and had to get back, I just ate the tortilla around it.  When we complained to the waitress, she had a ridiculous attitude and told me everyone else liked it.  Yeah right.  I asked her to try a bite - she refused.  I asked for the owner, the owner refused to come over after the waitress spoke to her and only came back over to lecture me about how if the food was bad I should not have eaten more than one single bite before sending it back.  Are you !@#$%^ KIDDING ME???  YOU NEVER CAME BACK TO CHECK ON US OR YOUR DISGUSTING FOOD.  I refused to pay for it and she finally agreed to remove it from our bill.  If you can believe it, the service was even worse than the food.  I would never send anyone there and they are now on THE LIST.  And for the record I wanted to go to Rito's (BEST Mexican food on the planet).",

I was living in Phoenix back in the mid-80's and pining for LA-style Mex when I came across a review for this funky place on Buckeye Road.  I'm tellin' ya, my life changed after a single meal there.  No longer would I say that Phoenix had no good Mexican restaurants.  Time and life has taken me to different places and I now live thousands of miles away, but when I get a long layover at Sky Harbor, I'm happy, because it means I will have time for a meal at Rosita's.  My personal favorites are the red AND green chile, so I usually order the half and half, unless I'm going to be in town a few days.  The chips and salsas are the best in the US.   I LIKE the area that Rosita's has moved to.  After dinner some night, take a drive through the trailer park in back; it's like a time warp into the '50's and there are some really cool old Lucy and Desi trailers in that park.",
