    "text": "Had high hopes for this local restaurant.  Brought my out of town guests here.  They don't take reservations so that was stressful but assumed it was because they have fast turnaround based on the menu items.  Got there after picking up my last guest from the airport.   Love the location, staff seemed nice, had s 30 min wait told to us at check in although there were a bunch of empty but dirty tables.  I assumed it was because dinner rush just ended.  It was about 8:20 on a Friday.  Had drinks at the bar.... strawberry Lenore cocktail was sooooo tasty.   Once seated we placed or orders, took a bit to our second round of drinks, had guacamole and fundido for our apps which I really enjoyed not to mention their great salsas (a red and green). Awesome....so far not so bad just a bit slower than expected. Unfortunately this was when it went a bit south.... aside from my husband who got the enchiladas who lived the mole the best out street Tacos were subpar.  The pork belly was doggy and chewy, shrimp were average, the other pork taco I forget what it's called my friend said was horrible seasoning and he couldn't eat it, and the chicken was dry..... not to mention we initially were waiting about 35 minutes after Apps and were told our order was lost and the replacement ticket was entered and our food came in minutes?!?!  I lived the flour tortillas nice and fresh, but others in the party were surprised that corn tortilla were not an option.   I would give this place another try if people were meeting there because drinks were good and apps were good but I regret that my company were so disappointed. Especially since I'm considered the foodie of the group (visiting from Austin and NY).  All and all atmosphere is young and hip, drinks well made, location good; but servers seemed way understaffed and not the best trained.  There is great potential though.",

I've had:  - Otro Salad: Yum! Sort of like the kitchen sink of salads but everything tastes really good together and the large size is meal-worthy with a little something extra. - Arugula & Quinoa Salad: Solid Mexican flavors rounded out by the bite of arugula and the creaminess of avocado. It's more quinoa than a lettuce type salad. - Vegetable Tacos: One of the best tacos ever! The tortillas are soft & fresh. The filling is in-your-face-delicious - sort of like a mexican curry of flavors. - Guacamole: Really good but a little on the spicy side.",

The flavors were great, the chunks of sea bass, shrimp, jicama, cilantro, radish and cucumber slices were mixed in a light grapefruit based broth and not tomatoes, so that was a great find. The lemonade was very tasty too. And. Dessert was a yummy cupcake of pumpkin, cranberry. And nutmeg with cream cheese frosting.  Priced just right. I'll be back. Glad to know its there.",

Messy but wonderful. Fries are A+.  The menu offers breakfast items and lots of interesting Southwestern and Mexican dishes with a flair with very reasonable prices.  Yes, it is quieter than Gallo Blanco, but that is a plus if you want to have a conversation with someone.  The ambiance is not so wonderful, but if you want good food at reasonable prices, you will notice why this place is crowded.  Parking is somewhat limited.",

    "text": "I went to this place today for lunch. Everyone was very nice. I sat at the bar so I got in right away and sat down. I heard the tacos were the best in town so I had to try a couple. I had the El Pastor taco and a Carne Asada taco. They brought them out on a plate so the tacos laid flat and open face so to speak. They were a little smaller than I hoped for. More street taco size. The El Pastor had a red marinade from the meat that flowed onto the plate and onto the other taco. Not a big deal as it was good but made the tortilla pretty juicy on the outside. They both had a good flavor but I was a little hungry still after just two. Everyone was happy and the place had a good buzz. I think I would come back but maybe try a burrito or other Mexican food. The price was not expensive but a little high for what I got I think. About $8 for two small tacos.",

Reminds me of done of the down town coffee shops and the open space into the kitchen makes you feel more apart of the cooking experience. I recommend the Paella and Pollo Asado.  The house made tortilla are chewy and fresh. This is another venue striving to provide fresh local ingredients in their menu.  I had their enchiladas with Verde twice with varying success. The first time they were incredibly hot the second much milder and pleasant. Very much with a visit!   My only complaint was twice when I went they had live music that made it almost impossible to speak with your dining companion.",

I knew it was there and because my favorite pharmacist recommended it, I decided why not.   The food was interesting, I had the three enchiladas each with a different sauce.  I found I was expected to get all three with the same ingredients.  Because it was my birthday, and the cook was new, they let me get two vegetable and one chicken. I think i was there on the right night to be able to have gotten that substitution.  I won't plan on it happening again if I go on another night. When your server tells you about the sauces listen to.  What they describe as spicy will be.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  I do think I preferred the vegetable enchiladas but thought a bit more cheese in them would have been a nice touch.    More modern Latin food is served here. Some I haven't tried so I plan on going back to try some of the other items on the menu.  What I saw coming out to other diners looked intriguing.    I say the prices are moderate but that doesn't include alcohol.  If you have drinks, I don't know.  Nice interior that is clean and simple.  I like that with some interesting art on the walls.  They have a nice patio out front.  Parking is not a problem at all and it is easy to find.",

As for the food, I can't imagine anyone saying anything bad about it. Every single thing we've tried on the menu is fantastically delicious (even though the taco prices are high for a single taco, they do load it up). Last time my husband tried the burger, and yes, even the burger is impeccable. So, go here during off peak hours, enjoy good food and that incredible salsa they serve with their chips.",

We then found that the table had a leg problem and was so uneven we had to move to another table. This is probably how the water spilled in the first place. There was water all over the floor we found as we switched tables. Even after telling our server about these issues they did not clean up the floor, fix the table or offer any courtesy for my husbands pants now being soaked. I was sort of amazed they didn't offer any compensation as most restaurants would. A little later we watched as they sat another couple at the same table who started dealing with the broken table immediately. They also brought the entrees out too fast as we were just starting our appetizer.  I have to agree with others that there doesn't seem to be a manager overseeing things. Unfortunate for Otro, as there are so many other choices in the area.",

    "text": "The BF and I just got back from lunch/happy hour at Otro. Let me start by saying I like Gallo Blanco, and I was fully prepared to like Otro. The space is nice and open and it wasn't nearly as busy as GB usually is. I ordered an individual guac, a carne asada taco and a fish taco and the BF ordered the turkey sandwich. The guac was good, just like the guac at GB and the salsas were also the same, so that was good. When the food came out, mine looked good, although the presentation isn't as cool as at GB (flat on a plate, not on a taco rack) and the tacos looked smaller. The BF was surprised to find mayo on his sandwich, since it wasn't listed on the menu. He told the waitress he had an egg allergy and she took the sandwich back and they remade the sandwich. Anyway, as far as the tacos go, the fish wasn't nearly as good as the one at GB and wasn't my fave fish taco overall...not sure what fish they use exactly, but it was a little fishier than other white fish I have had in tacos...it could have been an off day, who knows. The carne was good and had decent flavor. Both tacos required salsa, but their salsas are so good, that was fine. So then the BF's sandwich came back and looked better, so he ate it and enjoyed it very much. Now, this is not accusatory in any way, BUT I think there is a possibility that they just scraped the mayo off of the bread instead of remaking the sandwich because the BF got extremely sick to his stomach as we were leaving....I cannot say with certainty that this was what caused him to feel sick and I also cannot say with certainty that they didn't make the sandwich fresh with new bread because I wasn't watching and he may have been sick from something totally unrelated, but it was a little suspicious, and if that was the case, this restaurant should be more cognizant of the effects of food allergies on their customers since they can be very serious. Anyway, I would say that the food was overall good, but I can't say I will be rushing back here any time soon, especially when their sister restaurant is so close by.",

The food and drinks were pretty good as well. However, I ordered the breakfast chilaquiles thinking they would be traditional style but they came out more like tortas layered with chicken and cheese and eggs on top. The chicken was also a little dry and not very much flavor. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito which looked really good with chorizo beans and all the other good stuff. I'd definitely go back again and try something else.",

That being said, some of the other dishes are inconsistent. I have enjoyed the vegetarian paella in the past, but last time I ordered it, it was undercooked and tasteless. I also had the pasole which was inedible. It was like water with some pork thrown it.

I asked the server what the vegan options were and he said, \"not much.\" Then it was silent. Then I asked since there \"weren't much options\" to tell me what they were and he said, \"you can have a side of vegetables.\" He was so rude. I almost grabbed my stuff and left but I didn't want to ruin it. I had veggie tacos (I saw on IG the tortillas are vegan). Overall, I love that this restaurant supports local produce, I love the options for vegetarian and vegans but the waiter I could have gone without. Five stars for the restaurant, 0 for the service. I wonder who pissed him for today.",

I've been to Gallo Blanco (Doug Robson's other establishment that was once at the Clarendon) and tried my first Elote from Otro at the Roosevelt Row Chili Pepper festival. I finally came here one early evening for happy hour. I loved the cleanliness and the vibe in this place. The menu consists of a variety of tortas, burritos and taquerias. The elote with its combination of smoked parpika and Cotija cheese is just amazing. I always go for pork and carne asada and ordered them both for my taqueria choices and a Dos Equis Lager. I really enjoyed the pork belly and all the flavors that came with that taco. With the happy hour prices, this place was both affordable and easy to stop in for a quick bite at the bar. I had a pleasant dining experience and look forward to stopping in again.",

    "text": "Ok so an update - 10/1 - went back just to give another try.  This place is horrific. Can't tell you anything about the food because we never get to try it.  Sat there for 50 minutes without our food had to hunt down our server and then still didn't bring us anything we needed.  I don't know where the reviews come from - never again.  This is a sad sad restaurant that will eventually shut down for sure.  Pass - if you base the salsa on what food is to come then I'm guessing the food stinks.  Always out of something too.  Today was the torta bread -   I am so disappointed.  We showed up at 11:30am this morning specifically requesting fish tacos because all of the great reviews and the craving for great grilled fish tacos.  We waited for about 30 minutes got seated and then we sat for another 20 minutes until our server Cecilia showed up.  I specifically told her I knew what I wanted (fish tacos) but the family needed \"a couple\" of minutes to order and we would order the guacamole as an app with no cheese.    Again we waited and waited no chips no app no drinks.  I ordered a \"premium\" Mexican wine to enjoy with my tacos. Waitress comes back, I checked on our app as it still wasn't there and she forgot to put it in!  She Disappers for a bit again, eventually returns with a poor quality guacamole.  Ok, kids ate it so that's fine.    We ordered all of our meals and waited and waited.  Right when ALL of our family's food  was coming out she comes to the table and says, \"oh, we are out of fish.\" HELLO? either the manager or owner came over and I went through the entire scenario and all he had to say was, \"we've been out of fish since they received the order Friday and ran out yesterday.\"    My husband said we aren't eating if you can't eat so we told them never mind give us the check and we will try another time.  The manager or owner said, \" well what do you want to do with the other food.\" What really?  I don't care.  No apologies no nothing.    We were there from 11:30am-1pm and ate NOTHING BUT CHIPS and had to take a $70 bottle of wine with us!  You can afford huge billboards attracting people and a \"good story,\" but can't accommodate or at least inform your guests not hold up to the reviews.  Awful service awful management and quite frankly the food (guacamole) I would eat my 11 year olds before I would this place!  Pass!  We walked out with  an $88 bill and had to go to eat at a reliable Mexican food place (presidio) as we know there is consistency and care about those customers.  BTW - I should have known that when our waitress was carrying around dirty utensils in her back pocket - and I had to tell her before she removed it - that may be a sign to just leave.    Wow - don't stop here ---",

I've had quite a few of their menu items from burgers to burritos to tacos. Their carne asada is AMAZING and from what I'm told, their food is fairly healthy. Love going here!",

    "text": "Do not come here, and if you do, do NOT park here.  I'll start with the restaurant. We used to love the restaurant, and we'd visit it upwards of twice a week. The staff new our names and our food orders by heart, they were helpful and friendly, and the food came out on time. In recent months, they've gone downhill considerably. Disrespectful staff, food takes forever, etc. Don't come if you're looking for the Otro that used to be here, now there's just the... other one.  Now for the parking. I parked in the Bethany Shops parking lot when I went to Joe's Midnight Run, because I thought Joe's was a part of the Bethany Shops (there is no indication either way, and the parking lot borders it). I guess it's not, because my car was towed between 12 and 1:30 am. The signs posted do not include the city ordinances and many other required pieces of information, so this action is already illegal. The next morning we go out to pick up my car way out in downtown Glendale, and find an unmarked residential-looking building surrounded by barbed wire, with about 20 people and 3 police cars out front. Long story short, Maverick Towing tried to charge me $195 dollars (illegally; the max is $105) in addition to making my family, myself and 20 other people wait out in the heat for nearly two hours.  If you do park at Otro and get towed, make sure to bring printouts of the relevant Phoenix and Glendale city ordinances.",

    "text": "I love this place. The actual place, decor, service, but the most important when it comes to a restaurant is the FOOD! Their food is perfection!   When it comes to Mexican food, I have very high expectations. That is why I usually don't go to Mexican restaurants, as they just load things with cheese, fat and some kind of tortilla and call it Mexican.   This restaurant cooks Mexican food to perfection. They have a balance dish where you can taste all the ingredients. They give the traditional Mexican food their own little Chef's spin- and results in art without staying far from real tasting Mexican food. The perfect example are their version of Chilaquiles- the typical chilaquiles have chip size tortillas with salsa and eggs or chicken. Their chilaquiles are the tortillas, but layered with the correct type of salsa (traditional). I order the ones with roasted veggies that are cooked to perfection! they have a large size, so I share them.   I have invited friends that are not fans of Mexican food, and they do offer other dishes that are not Mexican and are delicious. Their pancakes are excellent! They are made in the griddle, so they are not mushy and they have different toppings you can order. We had the banana ones. Great!   They also perfectly brewed coffee- which not all breakfast restaurants have good coffee. We have gone for breakfast a couple of times the last month- I haven't gone for lunch in a long time, but I remember it is delicious as well.   Two thumbs up! I always recommend this place! And the owner or co-owner are always there!",

I tried the pork belly taco, the shrimp, and the cochinita (shredded pork). I'm determined to give this place another shot though.

The guacamole is my favorite of any restaurant I've been to in the Valley and is served with thick & perfectly crispy chips. While I could easily just eat chips & guac for a meal, I'm a big fan of their tacos as well. The one less-than-stellar point would be their margaritas, which while very good (especially the prickly pear), are disappointingly tiny for the price.   As others note this place is owned by the same folks who used to own Gallo Blanco. Having been to both places--Gallo was super close to my house and I only started going to Otro once it closed--I can say the food is pretty much the same.  As long as you're mainly looking for good eats (and not somewhere to get several rounds of margs), you won't be disappointed!",

For starters, they take way too long to even come offer you any drinks and another long wait until the drinks come. They take long on ordering and bringing you the food, its just tacos and burritos how long can it take? Our burritos came and it was cold!! Let me mention the place was empty so being busy can't be the reason. Finally after waiting a while the server decided to come ask how the food was, when we told her the problem she went and told the manager ( I have no idea how she became the manager), instead of just apologizing and taking care of our meal she stood there and said I don't know why or how that happened and offered 10% off...YES 10%!!! We saved $1.80 off our bill!! holy shit thank god for her I really needed that $1.80! I find that offensive to offer me a dollar off when really the burritos should have been replaced or free. Also, I have ate there 5 times now and only 1 time the service was good because the food was to-go. The food is pretty good especially the burrito(when its hot) but a little too over priced. Only because the food is good I will give them a star. Oh and if you're planning to go with a bunch of people, they barley have space so I would call ahead of time or go early daytime when its empty. In the end, if you only care about the food and not service this place is good but if you're like me and being charged restaurant prices for a burrito it better come with good service.",

The service was the worst I have had in a very,very long time , repeatedly asked for chips before they arrived and waited 40 minutes for our lunch. Unfortunately  the food was not edible and  we had no silverware .In retrospect they may have been trying to discourage us from eating the awfull meal.I ordered heuvos rancheros and my mouth tastes like charcoal  2 hours later. How do you butcher eggs and beans?The real issue is lack off emphasis on timely service.I can tolerate imperfect food (awfull) if I think the staff cares.",

Truthfully this place has REALLY good tacos, chips, guacamole, entrees, etc. that you can't help but love this place.  We are already planning on going there again soon.

It's worth the drive.",

    "text": "Great food!  Husband and I had the Pica Rico burger. Excellent. Bartender was good and waited while I decided what to drink and made good drinks. Only issue came with the slight attitude from the bartender when I mentioned the music (Spotify). It was playing '90's which can be great but seemed out of place in there. Didn't intend for her to do anything but she just cocked her head and said \"you don't like it?\"  I'm in customer service and expected her to say \"oh, it changes later\" or \"yeah, not everyone's a fan\" but she acted as if I was stupid (and old) for mentioning it. Then, right after, as we turned to leave, I pointed toward a rear door and asked a young man behind the bar if the that lead out to the back parking area. He said yes, and then said \"it says exit\".  Which it did...Not a big deal but made me feel stupid ( again). Yes, it did say exit but in my work place those signs also indicate alarmed doors.  Didn't expect the snarky comment.  Just young staff being jerks but the place was filled with all ages so not sure why they felt comfortable with the the attitude.  This was between 5 and 6pm so not busy.  No biggie but tired of people thinking they can say anything and no one catches the underlying tone.",

    "text": "I went there last night with my boyfriend after hearing many positive reviews from friends and co-workers. It lived up to the hype. The atmosphere is a little more lively then what I typically like to go for when it is date night. (Bright lighting, open center booths, open kitchen concept) Please note, I am not knocking them for these features. I can dig it.  On to the food. We had the Coctel de Camaron for an app. and the white Sangria for drinks. We both liked them. We split the Paella De Campo and each got a taco. I opted for the Carne Asada, and he got the Al Pastor. Both were good, but my vote was for the Al Pastor. It was simi sweet, not overly sweet which is why I chose the asada instead. Then we over indulged and got the coconut pudding for dessert. We enjoyed it, but could have used less chocolate shavings (I know, what kind of girl says that?) The chocolate shavings were shaved small, but there was a lot of it which I personally felt took away from the pudding. Okay the best part, the price. We had a total of 4 drinks, 1 app, 1 entree, 2 tacos, and dessert for $56. I was very impressed. Keep up the good work!",

We shared the Otro salad, split the carne asada burrito and split an al pastor taco. I thought they had cheap ingredients in the salad and they skimped on the kale...in place there was a ton of cabbage, which looked it came out of a frys bag...with corn nuts that were sparse and cubed avocado. They also skimped on the steak in the burrito and had a ton of beans...the steak that was there didn't have much flavor. Most of the food was bland, which my wife liked...she likes a little less flavor or punch. She thought the taco was ok... However, it greased out more than a New York slice and I would way rather have Americas taco shop al pastor. I didn't get the enchiladas because they were 14 for three and I wanted to try more options...all in all seems like a good decision now. I liked the tomatillo sauce for chips but the red salsa was all spice and no flavor. Maybe there are other items on the menu worth trying but with so many better options in the valley and the price tag here, I think I'll stay away.",

We come here so often they know us all too well, especially the morning crowd. Their pancakes and authentic Mexican breakfasts are wonderful (berry pancakes and breakfast burrito). Kids also eat for free in the am and with our two kiddos they cannot get enough.  As far as dinner goes, the few times that we have been here the service has been lackluster. Management needs to staff more servers or hire more employees to keep up with the crowds on the weekend. They run around with their heads in all different directions. That being said, the servers are amazing and do the best with what they are given. Hands down best server is in the morning for breakfast. If I could remember his name I would throw it in here but he is the tall skinny guy (checks in on every table even though they aren't his and always makes a connection with our kiddos). Hopefully management can make some changes to up their service game, but the food never disappoints!",

Along with sister restaurant Gallo Blanco, they have the best fresh Southwest food I've had in as long as I can remember. When I lived in PHX I lived across the street from Gallo Blanco before they closed and reopened. When I moved back to Seattle I literally used to wish for the food from Otro and GB. For years. It's that good and we have nothing close on Seattle.  We always look forward to starting out with the chips, sometimes the queso crisp, or the guacamole. The green salsa is to die for with the chips and on everything else. Naco torta, al pastor, whatever you get it's going to be great. If you struggle with the sweet/savory conundrum like I do, for brunch I recommend the sampler so you get one of the flapjacks (I like the bananas and caramel option), chorizo, and eggs. Hits the spot.   Don't miss this place while in PHX. Sit on the back patio and get a Bloody Mary while you wait for your food.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - NWA - Straight Outta Compton)  Straight Otro Cafe, hungry funky Yelper named Bo Bites From the gang called Yelpers with Elite Badges When I'm called on, I got my song on Squeeze the bottle, and salsa is poured on Two drinks, boy, if ya drink with me My reviews are gonna have to come singing from me Off those stars, that's how I'm goin out  Otro Cafe is a Americanize Mexican food joint with some cute artwork and what I can describe is a classical home kitchen feel.  I really enjoyed walking in and looking at the arts and the open feel of this place.    My partner and I sat at a booth and shot for their Happy Hour drinks; $1 off pretty much most anything you ordered.  For our starters we went for the Chips and Guacamole and Queso Fundido.  The chips and guacamole were both thick in texture.  The guacamole was still creamy to the palate and had some fresh onions bits while providing a strong limey taste.  It came along with two sides of salsa in a squirt bottle; red and green.  The Queso Fundido came out hot on a skillet along side with some flour tortillas.  Super cheesy with some mushrooms and sausage mixed, it was both hot in temperature and just a tad bit spicy, but not too overwhelming.    As for our entrees with both went for the tacos!  I went for the traditional Carne Asada and Cochinita.  Both tacos came on a hand made tortilla, which was warm and soft to the bite.  The Carne Asada had a bit of charred texture but the guacamole smoothed it out.  The Cochinita had a subtle texture and sweet taste with a hint of the achiote.  Both were topped with cilantros and onions.    Overall, I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Otro Cafe.  I heard they serve Breakfast, but I'm too lazy sometimes to travel to get my food!  However, for happy hour drinks and small bites this place definitely delivers! - Enjoy!",

Favorite meals were the appetizers and mole chicken dinner- none of which are pictured here. They also loved to cheese corn dish- but after its shanked down, it will only feed 1-2 people. They offer chips with 2 types of salsa straight away- the orange color is spicier, with the green being neutral.  The outdoor patio atmosphere is pretty good. We also enjoyed the bar situation.

We came here for a lunch during the work day and we expected our lunch to take a little longer than normal, but this was a verrrrrryyy long lunch as we had to wait at least 30-40 minutes for our food.  It should be noted that the restaurant wasn't even at capacity.  I might come back on a weekend when I have more time to spare, but will not make this a regular place for workday lunches.  I ordered the paella and it was really tasty.  Funny enough, my favorite part of the meal was the flour tortillas they served on the side.  Those tortillas were to die for!  They were heavy, buttery, chewy, soft perfection, yum.  It was also enough food to take home and have another very filling meal.",

    "text": "Have you been to lunch where your 3 year old dumps the salt and proceeds to walk her doll through the \"snow.?\"  I have one available if you would like to try it out.  This may or may not have happened while dining here.  When you enter a nice (and super cute might I add oh wait scratch that I am married and he is probably 21 years old) host greets you.  The place wasn't very busy and we got seated right away on the patio.  The decor and ambience to me were boring and might I add it is in a strip mall meh meh meh.  We started out with the chips and salsa.  I am a stereotypical white girl who wants free chips and salsa, so that I can fill up on these before the meal comes.  Not here.  You have to pay and our chips were gone fairly quick. (they were only $1, but still $1 is a $1). The saving grace is the chips were good and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't make them there. They bring you a red salsa and a green salsa.  The salsas are made fresh every day. My favorite was mixing the 2 salsas together for a nice surprise.    I ordered the shrimp taco and the carne asada taco.  They were both very flavorful, but unfortunately both were dry and slightly overcooked.  The tortillas are made there and you can tell because they were tasty, but flour so not traditional.  My daughter had the beans and the chicken taco, which to our surprise were the ripe ole price of FREE.  Next time my daughter is going to be super hungry and order everything off the menu or maybe I will treat her preschool class to lunch one day. (M-F 2pm-6pm only) The beans were super tasty and I'm pretty sure my daughter kept asking me to stop eating them.  The chicken on the other hand was dry but flavorful.  I highly recommend the guacamole.  It came on the taco and I considered ordering an entire serving of it.   Service was a mixed bag.  They seemed on top of things at first and then we never saw them.  We had to ask for our check 2-3 times.    I really love the fact they are family owned and a neighborhood restaurant.  I want to go back and try a few other things.  Next time will be Brunch.  *****Came back a second time and service was slooooooow.  Food was mediocre.  I liked it much better the first time.  Honestly don't think we will be back very soon.",

Each time our visit has been a success. The chiliquiles are one of their more popular breakfast items and definitely worth a try, for my two cents.   Also big ups to the service at Otro. They're always on the ball and right on time with everything from drink orders, to refills, to clearing the table. All in all, I just highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good breakfast experience but don't require the place to be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives -- because Otro seems to be a little too good for that nonsense.",

Nice decor, not too cluttered with stuff.  Our server, Anthony knew the menu well and made good suggestions. I came in specifically for the Noca (I think that's right...lol) torta. I follow Otro on Instagram and someone posted a pic of that sammich, I literally told my wife to make a Uturn and head to Otro for that one - carne asada (ribeye) with guac on the bun and two fried eggs (I had over medium, perfect temp for a sammich). It was loaded with flavor, I would definitely reccomend that torta! Or, they will make it for you as a burrito also. Delicious! Sorry about not taking a photo of it! There is one on their Instagram page...lol.  My wife had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, avocado and of course, hollandaise sauce....lots of hollandaise...lol. She likes it saucy, like her. I had a taste of course and it was savory and delicious! She enjoyed it very much, she is a eggs benedict addict.   Our little girl had a kid's quesadilla with Oxaca cheese and some crispy fried potatoes. She ate every bite and ate some of ours! I guess she likes it.   Manager (or owner) stopped by our table and was a nice host. I'm sorry I cant remember his name, a tall guy with a pleasant demeanor. I told him we would definitely be back! He said Sundays are crazy before 1pm, so you can call and see what the wait is. No reservations, so plan on a wait on the weekends. Great spot, go check it out!",

The tortillas are so soft and the sauce they put on the tacos should win an award for most addicting. I can literally put that sauce on anything. I also like their L.A.

To the point that we were questioning what is going on in that kitchen.  We went on a Tuesday night and the food took forever to arrive. The servers were also way too busy. All the servers are pleasant, so it really made me want to like this place. But we tried for at least 10 minutes to hail someone over every time we wanted to ask for something.  The food was also subpar. The \"large\" guac was pretty small (3 of us shared and finished in less than 3 minutes). The description said the guac had oranges and other tasty ingredients, but no one in my party could find them. The paella rice tasted like rice out of a box. And the pork in the pork tacos was really salty.  My boyfriend and I love great food and are of the opinion even if a place is not True and authentic Mexican, if there is something they do great, we would still keep coming back. We did not find that at Otro Cafe, and we probably will not be back again.",

The french fries were potato wedge style and were cooked very nicely.   It was a little hot on the patio, and they could definitely use some more shade. But that didn't stop me from enjoying another experience at what has definitely become my favorite Mexican spot in Phoenix. Maybe even earth.",

My wife and I came came with a few friends a couple weeks back and I got two chicken tacos and a carne asada burrito....hey it was happy hour I had to do it big. I was very surprised with the chicken tacos because I did not know that the mushrooms were going to pair so well with the taco. Also, that aioli that they slap on those tacos is straight fire! I could put that aioli on anything and it would be good. Carne asada burrito was good but it wasn't my favorite. Chips and salsa were delicious. My wife got their breakfast and it came with a pancake, schreiners chorizo, and a few fried eggs. We both agreed that it was the best pancake we ever had and the chorizo was amazing! Happy hour is not that special though only like $1 off certain menu items. I will definitely be returning.",

The hostess ladies didn't greet us with a \"good morning, how are you....\"but with a rude ,\"how many?\" We sat for almost 15 minutes without anyone taking at least a drink order. We had to go to the bar and ask if we can order coffee.  We waited even longer to order.  By then I was over this place and was ready to go. The waiter just dropped out food off, still no questions of how we doing or if we need anything else.  Brougth our food and walked off.  I ordered the juevos rancheros.  It was very good.  A small bowl of fruit for 6 bucks.  The outside doesn't have a nice view.  The inside of the cafe is very cute. Very disappointed in the lack of hospitality but kinda not surprised. There's a farmers market down the road that I look forward to visit after this place. I'm sure a more pleasing environment.

That said the rating still would have managed 5 stars had we not been overcharged $2 each for the shrimp burritos we enjoyed. While the menu clearly indicated that they were under the flat taco / burrito price in the banner for the group- as only whitefish and pork belly carried a premium- our waitperson still challenged us and had to bring in the manager. The manager did make the adjustment but only after serving up a lame and nonsensical excuse / explanation about \"new\" menus - while only the ones that we ordered from matter    While we enjoyed our meal, we had the sense that we were not appreciated and will be faced with unsupported rising prices at on future visits.",

    "text": "I rarely seek out Mexican food, but we've been here a few times now. Didn't know it was affiliated with Gallo Blanco until I noticed a few familiar dishes on the menu. That's a good thing, since Gallo was one of the few, more authentic Mexican restaurants I enjoyed.  Food is excellent. You won't find the giant canoe sized plates full of shitty rice, pasty beans, questionable meats, soggy tortillas and watery salsa here like nearly every other TexMex toilet in this town. Everything I've had has been really good; tacos are outstanding, the Naco Torta is extremely good, and they've managed to keep most of the oranges out of the guacamole here (biggest let down of Gallo, ick!). We will try breakfast eventually. Only gripe was an entree steak salad I ordered. For the price, I expected something a little more generous than what was put in front of me. The steak was awesome, but they could have fluffed it up with another handful of greens. That being said, I won't venture too far from their staples in the future...  Drinks are good, a lot of innovative combinations that actually work, but all are super pricey and their quality is highly dependent on who's behind the bar. They have a few good beers, but nothing out of this world.   Where they lose stars, is the service. We have had outstanding service here, but we've also had Denny's like dismissive, inattentive service. Dry drinks, M.I.A. wait staff or bartender and a dash of attitude are what to expect when you strike out on service here. When the right combo of staff is working (seems to be just a few individuals that drag down the entire front of house), then your experience will be drastically better.    Overall, definitely worth a look. The food is great, just don't let the inconsistent service turn you off, and be sure to tip accordingly.",

Our drinks did not come at the same time, ordered appetizer and tried to order food, but the server just kind of wondered away! Probably for the better, appetizer servered by someone else and our server was M.I.A. the rest of the time.  Even the other servers seemed to be running around more chaotic than organized.

We were immediately served chips and two kinds of salsa; spicy red and a mild green. I only had a small taste of the red because I'm a wimp, it had quite a kick. The green was very fresh tasting and really good. I decided on the chicken noodle soup, shared guacamole, and my husband had the torta.   The chicken noodle soup was like a Mexican version of Pho. It was a big bowl of chicken broth with a generous amount of rice noodles and chunks of chicken. Fresh mint, basil, cilantro, bean sprouts and lime were served on the side. The broth combined with the fresh ingredients made for a very good meal.   The guacamole was very fresh, similar to Gallo Blanco with hints of citrus in it, it tasted great.   I only had a bite of my husbands torta, but the flavor was fantastic! The rice on the side was much different and had lots of fresh vegetables like squash and kale.  Oh and they serve passion fruit iced tea, which I love!  Service was very good too, they explained the menu and also warned me about how spicy the sauce for my soup was before dumping it into my whole bowl. I like being able to adjust the spice in my meals because I'm such a wimp when it comes to spice. I will definitely return to Otro Cafe.",

    "text": "Updated review:   We went in today and ordered the Sampler and a Yogurt Parfait. Everything was delicious. The band was really really great that they had playing. I'm changing my 5 stars to 4 stars because our server was awful (Reyna), but most importantly RUDE. We sat down and ordered right away. She asked if we'd like coffee and creamer and we said yes, she brought us the coffees but no creamer- we waiting 15+ minutes before asking for creamer and she was over a little dramatic and overwhelmed  like she had 20 tables and was super rude to my spouse saying she would get it when she can, followed by an extremely dirty look. She literally had 3 tables and half the restaurant was empty, but besides that, she could have faked a smile and politely said \"sure, give me a moment and I'll be right back\". Even after this, our coffee was now cold, and she still hadn't brought us the creamer. We had to get up, dump the cold coffee out, walk to the front waiting room where they had coffee to get fresh hot coffee and creamer. (About 30 minutes after initially asking for creamer, and after we'd have our coffee from the front (empty cups now) did she bring it- shoving it on the table and running off. Never checking on us, on until she brought the check. In the meantime we had to grab stuff off of other tables that we needed during our meal.   I'd most likely rate them 4.5 but because there are no half stars, it's their lucky day!  Stopped in for brunch today. We ordered the Sampler Breakfast, Muesli and a side of Breakfast Papas. BOMB.COM. The sampler was delicious, we ordered it with Chorizo and it had really great flavored, and was not overly greasy (as chorizo sometimes can be). It came with a flapjack which was good (but my husband makes better ones, so it's hard to compete), and mini tortillas which were really really yummy! We ordered a side of potatoes to go with it, and honestly they were the best! They were super crispy on the outside with some seasoning salt, and nice and mushy on the inside! They also make their own hot sauce which I ended up dumping all over the potatoes because it was freakin scrumptious! The red sauce I think was habanero and the green was a jalapeno tomatillo (normally I don't like tomatillo but it was sooooo yummy, more like a green chili sauce), both had a spicy kick with really great flavors. I'd like to bottle both up and take them home.   The muesli was good, not my go-to item on the menu because I wanted carbs and I'm pregnant LOL. But it was much better than I expected, with some great fresh/crisp fruit.   I'll be going back again soon! I really want to try the breakfast hirr",

From the outside, the restaurant looks whatever yet when you walk inside there are so many little details that just make the place amazing. The place was packed yet we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waiter was amazing and was attentive without hovering over us so we could enjoy our meal and time together. I got a margarita (I know, for breakfast, right?) and when I asked for a second, the waiter laughed and told me that it's \"highly encouraged\" to get another which was funny. I got the Mexican Breakfast without the beans and used the in house hot sauce. It was some of the best hot sauce I've ever had. I'd put it on everything if I could. The vibe was great and casual and after eating, there's a mural that you can go take a picture of outside. I'd definitely come here again. I couldn't stop thinking about it after I left.",

I was recommended to try the Naco Torta by a co-worker. When i reviewed the lunch menu I couldn't find it. I asked my waiter about it, he checked to see if they would make it for me.  Luckily they did!!   So I decided to take in the sunshine and sit in the patio since the day was so nice.  The patio area is newer to the restaurant and I thought it was a great space.   My Torta came out.  The meat was beef, marinated in a delicious sauce. Not spicy but sweet marinade.  The bun was nice and soft which was smeared with guacamole. Lettuce and a fried egg on top.  The sandwich was fairly large. Don't expect any sides with this.  This sandwich took over most of my plate.   I tackled this sandwich by taking my fork and knife and cutting pieces off.  Yes the egg yolk ran down the sides of the sandwich.  It was heavenly.   Definitely going back to explore that menu thoroughly.     P.s. if you want chips and salsa you must request and pay an additional charge for your order.",

Our server was really friendly and funny and explained everything about the menu and answered our myriad of questions.   I got an al pastor burrito, I was worried it would be pineapple heave and too sweet, but that was not an issue at all. The sweet pineapple actually played well with some of the onion that was in there. I also like how they grilled the burrito. My husband got the enchiladas and the mole sauce was delicious, a very traditional mole with a great depth of flavor.   Or server did seem to disappear towards the end of the night, however I think he was the only server really. I really wanted dessert, but I guess they were closing and he just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else... Kind of a pet peeve of mine but I was too tired at this point to say anything.   Good food and a fun atmosphere, I would definitely come back.",

My wife settled on the Cochinita pork burrito, sans the flour tortilla, and I had a grilled fish burrito (with tortilla, which I left on the plate).  The ice teas (one green, one black) both contained passion fruit flavor, which is not our favorite.  We were not offered chips and salsa.   Our total was $31, which is a little more than we usually spend for lunch at many of the excellent Mexican food places in the area.

I asked if rice and beans could be substituted for veggies and mole on the side. Rick said no problem! What a fantastic dinner!!! The chicken was so tender. The rice is like risotto!! 6 delicious house made flour tortillas are included. I built tacos from my meal and they were some of the best tacos. Best mole ever! The Aji Aioli is delicious.

Wife liked the beans but I did not. And these reviews on the rice were so off. The rice was bland, needed salt and pepper. Should have been cooked with some kind of spicing in chicken broth. The queso fundido/mushroom appetizer was so good, served with those amazing little corn tortollas. The chips served were really good, the two sauces were good with the green the best, the red was too spicy for us. We ordered a trio of chicken enchiladas to share. Red,green and mole. Wow, the white meat chicken was so dry and tasteless, no flavor at all. We each took one bite of each and had the same reaction. Drinks are served in small glass glasses and they have so much condensation, leaving puddles all over the table. You had to wipe glasses each time or have water dripping all over you.

They have a decent food concept here but may not be executing to their potential. Something just isn't right about the space. Get some design help. My steak salad was good,  but not great. Skip the gorgonzola cheese. Goat cheese is a better ingredient for that salad.",

I just can't get over the crappy service. I ask for extra salsa because I order their chips but also want some for my dressing on the salad. I was given 1 red, 1 green. This is extra?? When you eat there you get an entire squeeze bottle for crying out loud!! Ugh! Not to mention that I am often treated like I am bothering them. I have had takeout orders messed up before and always go through to make sure I don't get home without something I paid for, they seem annoyed. They always seem put off by the fact that I am there to buy their food at all. I don't eat at the restaurant itself because the service is always poor. I am close to giving up on this place and their good food. I can't continue to give my money to a place that treats me bad. There are too many great places in central Phx to frequent. I will have to go elsewhere.",

I had the huevos rancheros with a side of bacon.  I'm generally not a huge fan of Latin food, but this place is definitely changing my mind. I didn't even read as much as I wanted cause I was focusing on the meal. I was full half-way in and had to command myself to stop eating.  My food came out quickly, nice and hot and served with a smile by Valerie.  I definitely will be back for Happy Hour as the menu looked very interesting.",

Party of 6 of us - man I love summer when the tourists leave and you can get seated right away anywhere. So nice to have craft beer on tap with my Mexican food - Four Peak Hop Knot IPA. Started with the chips and guac which I thought was very good, although I would have preferred it with the cheese on top. The elote, on the other hand, was wonderful -- as good as I've had. I ordered the \"paella\", which was a ittle thicker than a standard paella and seafood-less, I believe (Chicken, sausage, ham, root veggies). Very nice, and although I had plans to save some for tomorrow, it didn't happen. Wifey said the chicken mole was good, but she still prefers the version at Pepe's Taco Villa. OK, to each her own. Split an order of the coconut pudding (meh), and a key lime pie/tart/square/something that was phenomenal -- creamy and super-tart.  Only downside was that it was pretty warm in there. Don't know if they had A/C problems or were using a swamp cooler, but it was borderline uncomfortable at times. Crank up the A/C guys.  Great place. Great location. I'll be back to try the Al Pastor tacos, and can't wait to try the chicken soup everyone seems to be raving about...",

A veggie torta and the real reason to come if you are vegetarian the veggie paella.   Many of the basics here are similar to their sister location (gallo blanco) the thick quarter round chips the green and red salsas how ever a bit more sour.   The paella was great full of flavor and textures from the various fresh veggies, it was very hot from the nearly nuclear iron skillet it is served in so take your time as it will burn you. It is served with a few token corn tortillas which are good but few in number.  The value was decent I will be going back.",

It didn't help so we dump it in the caldo de pollo, which was bland. No apology from manager or waitress. We weren't happy and were still hungry so we left for another place. I later looked at my receipt and saw that they charged us something we didn't have. It was a small guacamole classic which was what the guy next to us was eating.

I'm going to straight up say that I enjoy the heck out of this place and I really like the laid-back Latin environment at this place provided as well in the area seems to be pretty cool with a lot of the restaurants and shopping. Always remember when I rate a place of five stars then I swear by it and this could be one of those places the more I go back and try it.   I only tried their breakfast burrito which I highly recommend it was very savory. I tried a little bite of everybody else's food as well. everything I tasted it was fantastic so this is definitely one of my places of choice for breakfast but I still have not tried anything else other than this so you never know it may reach the five star Someday. I would like to say keep up the good work because the Arizona restaurants are making a big comeback!",

Also, they run out key ingredients frequently.They took the best dessert in the world off the menu too. The chocolate pudding was the best I ever had. In a town of great tacos they have slipped from #1 to 10. We have no need to go back.",

The famous Gallo Blanco guacamole with mandarin oranges was attempted, but the guac we received had just one tiny corner of one orange in it, and was missing the chunks of oranges that we remembered and loved from the Gallo Blanco days.  The veggie street tacos didn't seem as good as Gallo Blanco either, and everything was definitely priced more than it used to be at Gallo Blanco.",

I recall everything being good, not great, on that note, I'm certainly overdue for a revisit. I do remember their Al Pastor being excellent, so now I have to go back!",

It's sort of has that hipster vibe all the Phoenix restaurants and bars are having now. It looks and feels great/ they have live music. Feels like a great date night place  Salsas were spicy and easy access in ready to use squeezable tubes. I'm a big chicken enchilada fan so I went with that and although they were crisp and tasty, the beans and rice that came alongside it tasted a little like dishwater which is kind of offputting. Maybe I just got the wrong thing. They also have breakfast for dinner which is awesome. And someone got something up look like pho (i think it's the caldo).",

I'd visited their booth at the Devoured Culinary Festival the year prior and have been craving those shrimp and grits ever since. I know, they aren't cheap and you didn't come to a Mexican restaurant for grits, but TRUST ME. It's worth it!! The chorizo makes those suckers absolutely phenomenal. I had plans to take half of my meal home with me for leftovers, but I couldn't stop eating. It was just too effing good.   I can't wait for our next visit. I'm dying to get my hands on that elote..... and eat more shrimp and grits, of course.",

I started off with a horchata, which came with a free refill. I wasn't a fan of the taste as it was quite watery. I like horchata where it's more milky and sweet. For appetizers, we ordered the small guacamole and callejero. For my entree, I got the small pozole because I wanted something to warm me up and hubby ordered the Pica Rico burger. The appetizers were okay- not sure if they are worth the price. The small pozole was pretty bland even with the extra items they included on the side. I ate enough to get me full. Hubby loved his burger, but I left somewhat unsatisfied especially when our bill was a little over $40 before tip. For that price, I expected a lot better.",

The patio is great and even if it's hot out, the misting fans make the environment cool and inviting. However, last Thursday night there was a hiccup--an annoyance that should be remedied.   I ordered the Torta which was heavenly, my guest ordered the Bistec al Carbon. It too was magnificent. My friend has a gluten allergy and asked to replace the flour tortillas that come with the dish ($24, mind you) with corn tortillas instead. We were told that they didn't have corn tortillas. When we asked the waiter he said 'we've been down this road so many times but we can't substitute it.' We pointed out that they served corn tortillas in the Enchilada plate. We were told no again. I asked to speak with the manager who gave us a weird and hard to understand explanation as to why they could not and would not give us the corn tortillas. They said they keep the kitchen separated as to keep gluten away from the other foods and that these were special corn tortillas that cannot be substituted. My dining companion is exactly the person you are supposedly creating these rules for. He was offered very hard corn chips as a substitute. A word of advice: make up a better, simpler story or go to Bashas' and buy a $3 package of corn tortillas and have them at the ready.",

A few of us arrived early to have some drinks but as others started arriving we were seated early (it wasn't busy on this particular Tuesday after 7pm). Our server Gabby was friendly and attentive, took drink orders right away and let us take our time making our decisions.  Almost everyone ordered the elote. Delicious. This time around I ordered a single enchilada, chicken, with red sauce, and a side of fries. Random but sounded good. The enchilada was ok. The fries came with a side of aioli and both were amazing. This was enough to fill me up...I wish I could have eaten it all.  A lot of breakfast burritos were ordered, one of the friends we were celebrating ordered the lamb (OMG!!!). Everyone seemed to enjoy the food. We sat and talked and had a lot of fun for a couple hours, all the while, Gabby and a couple others took care of us.   Another friend had made and brought a cake for the occasion and Otro was happy to store it and brought it out with candles and plates when we were ready to serve it. Thank you so much!!  After my first experience I wasn't sure if I would be back, but after this one, I definitely will be. Thanks so much for making it a good one Otro!",

The first time, we called in an hour before to say that a small army of fast metabolisms were going to be coming, and could you please get a table ready if possible? We waited about 30 minutes for an outside table, and we waited another 45 minutes for food. At this time (10:30 AM) about half of the tables at the place were empty.  The second time, we didn't call in beforehand. We waited about 20 minutes for an outside table, and we waited about close to an hour for food. This time, more than half of the tables were empty, and the restaurant actually turned away another party of 8 because \"the kitchen was too busy.\" What?  Other snags: no burritos or tacos before 11 AM, and you have to ask for chips (I think they're free?)  Why 3 stars? Why, the saving grace of this place is the food itself. The breakfast burrito is good, albeit small. I got the Mexican breakfast, and the chorizo was pretty good! I also got their take on a BLT, with guac and eggs. This was quite tasty and very filling for about $10. The horchata was pretty good too.  Service was good, bathrooms were clean and unisex.

Parking was no problem, and when I got inside I was shocked at how cute it was! The hostesses were super friendly and walked me to my friend's table. We started out with The Maryland and the Oaxaca Old Fashioned to drink. The drinks are made with fresh squeezed juice so be prepared to wait a little for them. The Maryland was light and refreshing, the Old Fashioned was totally different than a traditional recipe. The mezcal giving a more exotic smokiness.   For appetizers, we opted for the Queso Fundido with veggies and chorizo as well as the guacamole. The guacamole was tasty, very lime-y (which I like!) but could have used a little more flavor, good nonetheless. The queso was awesome, but honesty I am addicted to cheese (preferably melted and served with warm carbs) so I could just be easy to please. The chorizo was a great addition but the veggies didn't add much so I'd probably skip those next time. We decided tacos were a must, so I ordered the grilled shrimp taco and the pork belly taco. I loved how the tacos were so simple, not a ton of extra crap on them to distract from the main flavor. There was plenty of grilled shrimp and it was cooked perfectly. The pork belly was just the tiniest bit dry on the ends but otherwise awesome. I would get both again!   Service was good- she wasn't super friendly and outgoing but she did her job well. No complaints there. I liked how she explained about the drinks taking a bit longer because of the preparation involved.   Overall- just a few small things were off about the food, or maybe I'm just being nitpicky. Either way don't gloss over this place like I did and check it out!",

    "text": "Breakfast burritos all day, people. Breakfast burritos all day.   Not that I actually got a breakfast burrito--I was all breakfast-ed out by the time my dinner at Otro came around. But man, if you can get breakfast items all day, it's worth noting.  I was all about the Trio Enchiladas. That's three enchiladas (I opted for chicken) in three different sauces. I wasn't wild about the mole sauce, to be honest, but the ranchero and the verde worth definitely delish. I scooped up the sauce with the rice that accompanied the dish, and ended the feast pretty satisfied.   If I were to go back, I'd take a long look at the specials, or perhaps some of the more esoteric, uncommon menu items. I saw the soup come to the table, and that looked pretty great. And even though it's a Mexican restaurant, the best looking dish we saw was a steak. Looks like they do a 10oz steak with a Mexican twist (peppers, served with tortillas) and that could make for a change of pace.  The space was super cool. Remarkably casual, even though it's very well appointed and the servers were on top of things. We had a large group, and there's plenty of space, especially with that patio now open.  It was just what I needed after a long day of travel. Enough swanky that I feel like the trip was worth it, but comfortable enough (with comfort-esque Mexican food) that I could still relax. The strip mall looking location belies the comfort and class inside, that's for sure.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite place to eat authentic, flavorful, fresh, and beautifully prepared Mexican food.   I should actually use the word cuisine because the food is on such a higher level. It's obvious they use fresh ingredients and make the dishes from scratch. My husband and I love to share a big bowl of the Posole. So tasty with all the fixings,  just like abuela used to make. The tortillas have that salty tinge of homemade that is identical to the homemade tortillas I ate as a kid.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  My husband and I had a bit of a rough weekend so we were looking for some deeply satisfying comfort food. Otro was perfect! Despite the fact it was over 100 degrees out, we asked to be seated on the patio. No one judged or looked at us like we were crazy. Just the opposite, we were made so welcome, they kicked on the misters and fans and we were in heaven. Our own private patio. It was as if we had the place to ourselves. The staff is so friendly and accomodating.   We began with the Tuna crudo which were paper thin slices of sushi grade Ahi tuna swimming in a tasty citrus vinagrette and red chile peppers /jalepenos dotting the plate. I could eat that every day of the week, 3 meals a day.   In the past we've had the pork belly taco / burrito but this time we arrived too late and they were out of pork belly so we ordered the rib eye taco /burritos. We were not at all disappointed. So tender and seasoned to perfection.  We enjoyed our meal with a couple of tasty cocktails, the Maryland for me which is a light, zesty lemon gin beverage that tastes like a bubbly lemon drop in liquid form due to the addition of proseco. My husband had his fave, the bloody Mary which has several veggies for the garnish.   To me, Otro is a special don't miss kind of dining experience. If you want to try authentic, clean, fresh and beautifully prepared Mexican cuisine, this is YOUR best bet!",

Right........FANTASTIC!  We shared a torta, the torta Noca, with carne asada and an over easy egg and guac on it, the bread was light and airy and the flavor excellent. We had no room left for the coconut pudding, but got and shared one anyway.........light, fresh and again spot on delicious. We will be back if they keep it up......to you haters out there, STAY AWAY from here! I dont like to wait for a table!

First impression on menu items is that they're fairly cheap. Items are around $9 on average. Chips and salsa are free! Score. Since it's the same owner/chef as Gallo Blanco, the food is very similar. But I think the prices are much more reasonable. I had the asado chicken salad - portion size was good, I couldn't finish it. It was extremely tasty and I promptly inhaled it.

And coffee is from Lux so if you need a little caffeine with your chiliquilles (my preference is the veggie option slathered in the green salsa)  then don't hesitate.    This is a little quieter than Gallo but it is also a little more sterile feeling.  There is a warmth to GB that isn't here with the white walls and massive windows but that said the parking is far better, the food is the same high quality, and the hours are a little broader which makes for big appeal.  I'm just happy to have multiple locations to get some of Robson's yummy creations. :)",

I came in and sat in the seating area for 15 minutes without one of the employees even acknowledging that I was there. At first I thought oh maybe they're busy, but the girl who had taken my order over on the phone had actually told me verbatim, \"we're actually not that busy right now.\" This is not the first terrible experience I've had with Otro and at this point I can't justify going there for horrible customer service and average Mexican food.",

The guac is more spicy. I actually prefer it over Gallo.   Excellent burritos and enchiladas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And I love that they get their in house coffee from Lux.   The owner, Doug, is an awesome guy and made for a pleasant experience when we went.   Definitely a staple!",

    "text": "Decent food (had the breakfast burrito, which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy), great location, but some of the worst live music I've ever heard in my life, right up there with some wedding reception noise!  The restaurant was full and ONE person, an employee who seemed to be the singer's girlfriend, applauded.  Dead silence from everyone else.  For several songs.  It was really bad.  I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout, but thankfully the \"musician\" packed up soon after that.  The poor server apologized, and said they're working on the noise level, but I think they need to look at the talent level instead.  If I hear/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here, I will immediately turn around and leave.  This experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.  My first time I walked in I was ignored, there was no one at the hostess stand area, and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I wasn't looking at the menus.  I walked out after a bit.  Two strikes means I've yet to go back, since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close, much faster, and the women working there (owners?) give great customer service.  Their quality probably isn't as high as Otro, but neither are their prices.",

Our waitress Anna was literally called away to seat a single person (no joke) in the middle of taking our order. I mean my mother in law was mid sentence and Anna walked away. She tried to stay, but the manager insisted. Instead of seating the customer himself this manager decided it would be more important to seat a single customer. Later we had to ASK for a coffee refill. A red headed waitress came over and we requested decaf, she said she would be right back but never returned. Great food horrible service and management. PS They have a bad flu problem in on the patio. Part of it could be because they had a lady mopping the back patio WHILE we were seated with a rotten mop. Enjoy!",

The food here is good and full of flavor, but not the same flavor you're used to if you were brought up eating Mexican food. For example the huevos rancheros come with two small quesadillas, usually a treat, but the problem lies in that they used small flour tortillas for the quesadillas instead if crispy thin toasted corn tortillas. What you get is two think flour patties with melted cheese.  Where they get it right is with their chorizo and beans. This place is best if you are on a casual date or out with friends who didn't grow up eating Mexican food.",

    "text": "One Spanish Word: Michelada.  Not many Mexican places around town do the Michelada justice (or even know it really), which is pretty funny considering our neighbors to the south are all about it. And with good reason. A Michelada is Mexican beer and lime juice, with or without tomato juice or clamato, and a salted rim. It's delicious, and Otro's includes the awesome touch of red pepper infused salt on the rim for that extra kick. Normally I wouldn't lead a review with a drink, but that just tells you how excited I was about it.  Now, the food. I like meaty Mexican food, so I've stuck to the tortas and burritos here, both of which are really tasty. I recommend the carne torta and the al Pastor burrito or torta. Portion sizes are OK, not insultingly small, and not too big either. A burrito is about a foot long and you can wrap one hand around it, and a torta is served on a standard size torta roll. I like to eat, but I have never been known to have a gigantic capacity, and I have always finished everything on my plate but not left hungry.  As others have said, the guacamole is legit. Plenty of citrus flavor that makes it pop. I would also recommend the queso fundido if you like cheese and don't care about calories.",

Let me start with - i really enjoy Gallo Blanco. Id say that spot is one of those restaurants you can always go to and be satisfied. So i like the pedigree that Otro comes from.   Two words describes my experience: amateur hour.   Went with a party of 8. Called ahead and when we got there the restaurant was maybe half full.  Server didnt seem with it.  For example. A majority of us ordered coffee. We would finish. Then one of us would ask for a refill. He would then refill the one cup, then disappear.  Why didnt he ask if anyone else needed more? Another example. One of our party oreered hot tea. Brought a dirty mug. Told him - honest mistake - came back with a copper mug for a moscow mule.  Welp. Hot drink. Copper cup. Not possible to hold. That information didnt really register with him when we tried to explain.  He was more focused on the fact that it was clean.   Anyways. We ordered chilaquiles and tortas and pancakes and huevos rancheros. Literally took 45 minutes.  Pancake came out undercooked and room temp. Not to mention a sad spot where a pad of butter USED to be.  Huevos rancheros also room temp. Side of beans were hard crusted on top. Basically tells me it was sitting in the window for awhile. The chilaquiles were fine. Torta was ok.   Overall a dissappointing experience. Server was more work for us. Food was a bummer.   Oh well. I dont recommend this place.",

We started with an order of guac to share in addition to the salsa verde and spicy salsa that I think comes with each meal. I could drink the salsa verde, and the spicy salsa was also very good. The guacamole was like what I'd make at home (so amazing:). Chips weren't out of this world but they were decent.  I ordered the Naco Torta which was delicious! My friend hates eggs and didn't want to try it even with the eggs removed, but I convinced him and he downed an entire half (which is gargantuan) in a few minutes. He had the pancakes - sooooo good. Another friend had the chicken soup which she thought was a bit too salty but liked.  I also liked the dark wood for the booths and the atmosphere. I've been to Gallo too (same owner) and liked it, but thought the service was better at Otro and the lack of a wait was a nice bonus.",

They were out of fish for a taco, so I dinged them a star.  Their green salsa has just the right amount of fire for me. I didn't try the red.  Will be back and recommend to anyone who likes fresh, non-fried Mexican grub.",

We had friends recommend it and we are so thankful.   We had chips and salsa to start off until our meal came.  Our server's name was Austen and he was wonderful.  Very attentive yet not overly friendly or fake.  Sincerely and genuinely a very good server.   My husband had the pork  burrito which was so flavorful and I had the shrimp and grits. It will be very hard not to order something different it was that incredibly good!!!!   We will be back !!! ( probably tomorrow and the next day and the day after that.......).",

My buddy and I came in on a great Saturday. There was hardly a crowd but our food did take awhile to get to the table. I could see why they offer chips and salsa while we waited. Some will say, good things take time and I would agree with them here. I ordered the naco torta and my friend had some carne asada tacos. We both agreed that the meat is superbly tender. Marinated quite well. The decor here is lovely just like their sister restaurant, Gallo Blanco. I also love their menu branding, colors always do it for me and this place has it all. Food for the masses, designers, and everyone in between. For sure, I would bring my friends here again.",

There are lots of seating options and cute lights and plants everywhere, and I just loved the atmosphere out there.   They also have great happy hour deals, so we were able to get a lot for not too much. We each started with the happy hour margaritas - they were really tasty! We also had chips and salsa, and their chips are SO good. They're the legit kind that aren't just out of a Tostitos bag. I like how the salsa is in little squeezy bottles, too. But *watch out* because if you think the green salsa is spicy, the red salsa is like three times spicier lol. So maybe try green first ;)   We of course got the Queso Fundido, because I knew from the first time I went here it's amazing. I like the chorizo kind, which is super cheesy and has lots of tasty veggies in it too. They serve it with soft, homemade flour tortillas and it's amazing. Idk why more places don't serve queso with soft tortillas, but they're messing up if they're not.   Then for dinner, I had the Grilled Shrimp and Grilled Fish tacos, which were delicious. I would've had more, but I was too full of queso lol. My boyfriend had three others that he really loved, but I can't remember which ones they were! We'll definitely be back soon!",

First off, the flowers and the plants are super inviting and I wish every restaurant would get their act together and display fresh flowers. I know they cost a pretty penny, so I appreciate them very much!   We were seated in a nice booth and waters were dropped off promptly. We were greeted by Jesus and since we were slightly in a rush, he got our order right away. Food came out fairly quickly. We downed everything in like 10 minutes it was so good. Huevos rancheros, steak, shrimp and fish tacos, side of rice and of course the pancakes. I slurped it all down with a bomb Paloma. The cocktail had real juice in it, not that nasty mix most places use.   I haven't been out on a breakfast date in months because we just had a baby, and let me tell you, it was mouth watering and savory and delicious and I wanted to cry it was so good. Thank you thank you thank you!!!",

The bartenders are very attentive.  Knowing that I'm there and choosing my last few moments of freedom to be in \"silence\" and isolation.  Their pork belly is top notch.  Their drinks are amazing.    Almost as good is their brunch.   The French press is legit. The pancakes are to die for. The edges are crispy but the center is fluffy.  This mom, can't even get her pancakes that way.  Maybe it's the lack of time due to the calls of the kids but Otro never disappoints.",

My daughter in law ordered shrimp ceviche, no tostadas so we had to order more chips. My little one ordered a flapjack not a flapjack it was a not very good pancake all flaky and falling apart all mushy. We should've just gone to Denny's or ihop! So disappointed. I do not recommend.

The red is super spicy but that is because it is made from Chile de arbol. The guacamole was also very tasty and you get to enjoy with some home made chips. The server was very nice and attentive. My husband had the carne asada burrito and I had the cochinita they were both good but I'm not sure if the beans were made in house. They had a can like flavor but since they claim they make everything from scratch it could just be the mix of flavors. Restrooms are cleans and they accept all major credit cards. The best part is they have coke products as well as jarritos  Price is higher than most places but the fact that they do taste better than most places makes the price worth it.",

For brunch we had: Chilaquiles, Barbacoa and Eggs, Tamale (not sure which one) and Vegetables tacos. My husband wanted the Barbacoa tacos but they don't serve tacos with meat until 11 and we were there at 10:30am. I got my veggies without soy sauce and they had an excellent flavor to them. It's hard to find a good veggie taco (they can be too greasy or too bland...this one was great). My friends seem to really like their dishes. My husband wasn't thrilled with his dish but we would go again(after 11).   It's a really cute place. At one point a live band started playing music. The great part about that was that it was the perfect volume. It wasn't too loud so you could still hear everyone at the table. Our waitress was attentive and really sweet. I'd definitely come back.",

The charro beans were awesome and the rice was different for me but okay. I give this place a 3 stars because it's people and atmosphere! My family enjoyed their food but as for myself I wasn't impressed! I guess I expected more with New Mexico attached to the enchiladas.

Seventh Street in Phoenix is crowded with good restaurants and this one holds it own.  I came here after this restaurant's sibling the Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon Hotel in midtown Phoenix closed. Gallo Blanco's owner  is Doug Robson, a chilango by birth (Mexico City native).  This is my favorite style of Mexican food.

We ordered the chorizo burger and the cheeseburger with chips and guacamole for the table. The guacamole was good and chunky- just the way it should be. The cheeseburger that I had was delicious and cooked perfectly. My favorite part was the fries that come with the burger. Can't compare it to any other fries I've had before but they were perfectly browned and seasoned. Would definitely like to come back and continue to explore this menu.",

Came in around 11:30am and menu featured all breakfast items except for tacos, burritos, and tortas. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it came on a plate with nothing else. No sides, no chips. No chips even when they sit you down at the table.   Complaint to manager and only gave 20% off the check and one free dinner menu item next visit (I don't want to come back).   This place doesn't deserve the good yelp rating it has.",

Although ,when we got here it was not great at all we waited 5 min to get acknowledged that we were waiting to be seated in the lobby . Then a person just tells us to sit where we want so we choose a table . We waited for another 2 min until the waitress just throws us out breakfast menus and doesn't say anything and walks away to go back to flirt with a customer and eats his food . We waited another 8 min until a lady tells us if we have been helped  and I said no so she just goes and says let me find your server , she comes back minutes later and says \" I can't find her \" . We got waters and just decided to leave then and there . Many people passed at us and looked at us but didn't wanna help us . It was not even busy to begin  with more servers than customers",

    "text": "Date night doesn't happen enough for my husband and I, but when it does, we like to try restaurants that we haven't been to before.  So last night, after a quick shopping stop at the Crafeteria event hosted by Frances, we headed over to Otro Cafe for dinner.  We were not disappointed!  I used the Yelp app directions to find the location (duh!), and were psyched to find plenty of parking + no wait to sit down when we arrived without a reservation around 8pm on a Friday.  All of the employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and personable from the hostess and our server to Heather, another staff member that we recognized from another local cafe.    Our server, Randy was attentive and offered recs on the menu when we asked.  We ended up sharing an order of the Guacamole Classico as an app.  I ordered it with both chips and raw veggies.  I love that the veggies are an option.  (Veggies are chilled just right and include carrots, celery, cucumbers, jicama and radish).   The guac is chunky and includes avocado, cilantro, serrano chiles, lime juice, salt, white onions, tomatillos, orange and cotija cheese.  We each had a beer from their selection of both Mexican and local options, and then shared two entrees: the Pescado del Dia and the Mole Negro.  The fish came with veggies and the mole chicken came with fried rice and tortillas.    The ambiance is casual and features art on the wall from local artists.  The prices are moderate, especially considering portion sizes.  There is something for everyone on the menu too... and it's worth noting that Otro opens on Saturdays and Sundays at 8am for breakfast.  They get their coffee from Lux as well!  We'll definitely be back to Otro, and hopefully pronto!",

    "text": "This sister restaurant of Gallo Blanco didn't have to work hard to earn a warm spot as now one of my \"go-to\" places for breakfast, It wasn't too busy on Saturday morning, which was very surprising to the hubs and I. I guess we were early birds getting there a little after 8 because the place started to have people trickle in within the hour we were there.  To no one's surprise, I ordered the Chiliquiles Rojas. To this day, I still crave the Chiliquiles Verdes from Gallo Blanco, so I was just dying to find out how different or similar the taste would be. To tell you the truth, I couldn't really tell much difference, because I really loved the Chiliquiles Rojas. It definitely had some spice to it, but not the type that you can't handle. It's just packed with the right about of flavor and punch.   The Huevos Rancheros had a similar sauce but different enough that if you wanted to try both, they'd almost complement each other in a way. This one had no meat though. I personally like having protein, so I ordered my Chiliquiles with chicken.   We also ordered a side of Quesadilla Synchronizada, which is actually just a cheese quesadilla with Oaxacan cheese.   Funny enough, even though I took Spanish for so many years, I am embarrassed to say that I asked what the Verderas Crudas was. My particular menu did not say the translation directly beneath. The waitress just looked at me questioningly and politely answered, \"Those are fresh vegetables.\" Ah, but of course! Of course, I wouldn't know what veggies in Spanish was. I am a meatatarian. Veggies only get in my way! None of that green stuff for me! Perhaps it was just the scrumptious Bloody Mary taking hold of me and made me forget, but regardless, we enjoyed our brief time eating here. (Yes, I mean brief as in, we were hungry and ate quickly and the service was efficient and great!)",

    "text": "Ok, as we all know, it takes A LOT to get me to write a bad review.  It normally takes things like bad food, bad service, and an overall bad experience.  Well DING DING DING, we have a winner.    I went here for breakfast with my normal group of \"Dining Friends\".  We go to restaurants all over the valley just to try something new.  The service can best be described as untrained monkeys aimlessly running around.  There was no organization, no method to the madness.  Our orders were messed up not once, not twice, but 3 times!! As a matter of fact, I am the only person that received the correct meal.    Tim received the wrong thing.  He ordered oatmeal and got a parfait.  Then when his oatmeal came out, it was piled high with parfait items that he didn't want or order.  We got this fixed.    Jessica's meal was super spicy.  Nothing abnormal here except she specifically asked if it was spicy because she has issues with too much heat in a meal and was told no.  At this point she ate part of my meal because we were so disgusted by this time, no one wanted to order anything else.    James's meal came out wrong.  He ordered the meat version and got the veggie.  Not the biggest deal, but with strike 3 we asked for the manager.  Here comes the best part....Our waitress is the \"Head Waitress\" and the one in charge.  No other managers.  So we explain to her all of the issues and she walks away to get James his meal. She comes right back to explain that it wasn't her fault, the runner grabbed the wrong meal.  She spent SEVERAL minutes blaming everyone except the cable repair man for everything that went wrong.  Now again, mistakes happens and can be forgiven.  What can NOT be forgiven is the way we were treated.  The waitress went through great lengths to blame shift all of the issues on other people.  Never once did she apologize or try to really make the situation better.  It was all about her being in the right.  I guess I feel a little better knowing we were not the only ones treated that way based on one of our neighbors hearing our plight, striking up a conversation with us about a similar experience.  We could also hear random conversations from other tables.  NOT a happy day.  Perhaps a dedicated front of house manager could solve some of these issues.  I have made several jokes since then about trying this place again. I just find it hard to believe that EVERYTHING could go so bad in one sitting.  However, I refuse to spend my money at a place that obviously does not respect the people who show patronage.",

So in my latest effort to prove her wrong, I brought her and her friends to Otro Cafe, where I hoped the upscale take on the local cuisine would change her mind.To be sure, she seemed to be impressed by how the chorizo and vegetables made a typical queso fundido a little more interesting, and did I see a glimmer of jealousy in her eyes as she looked at my Inca salad, a wonderful quinoa mixture of Mexican flavors that was healthy and fulfilling? Or maybe the green-eyed looks of jealousy at my pork belly or al pastor tacos? Did she appreciate how the chicken soup was a Mexican interpretation of pho? I don't know, but there wasn't many leftovers.",

Nearly $8 for a small dish  Ahi Tuna Agua Chile- $12 enough to share for two as a light appetizer. I was excited for this one... but was completely disappointed after the first taste. I had to ask for a side of limes an doused it with salt to try and give it some flavor, but it remained insipid. We didn't even finish the dish because it was not worth eating.   The Carne Asada Burrito-  UHHHG. My plate came to the table and I could smell the distinct scent of that plasticy processed store bought tortilla. From the get-go the store bought tortilla smell was going to start this burrito at mediocre level, but then the taste ...:( It tasted like a chili-cheese hot dog. $9 and I didn't finish this dish either.   The only thing that I liked were the chips and salsa, and those were free :)  Although the chips and salsa were good, nothing else would lure me to vising this establishment again...not even for Happy Hour.",

    "text": "Hugely overpriced and overrated \"authentic\" Mexican food. Service was awful. Waitress hardly came by our table and had an attitude when she came. We watched our food just sit there for five minutes without anyone noticing it was ready.  Ordered the chilaquiles with chicken and the chicken was extremely disgusting. They gave me the worst piece of chicken meat ever, I literally gagged and spit it out. Even more appalling was the price I paid for a simple Mexican meal I can make for the same amount at home and feed four people. I seriously wanted a refund after eating that shitty chicken.",

We waited as several servers passed us by and I had to ask to order my son's food and all of our drinks.  We waited again and had to flag someone down to order.  Our drinks and food took an excessive amount of time to arrive, and something came out with an error.  The manager held a staff meeting during the breakfast rush, and we watched as an entire staff of folks gathered by the hostess stand while we were waiting for our food with empty drinks.  Not once did a manager visit our table.  It was a very disappointing experience to say the least, and sadly I will not be recommending Otro Cafe anymore.",

My husband had the breakfast burrito and said it was decent, but he wasn't overly impressed. The food took a while too...like a long while which was annoying b/c we had already waited so long for a table. It was around noon on a Saturday and we waited like 30 mins for a table. Funny thing is, no one was ahead of us. We were next to be seated, but no one was leaving the place. Not the restaurant's fault...just annoying. Overall we were at Otro Cafe for like 90 mins. We just wanted brunch and to be on our way, but instead ended up hanging out way longer than we wanted to or planned on.",

    "text": "It's hard to compete with Gallo Blanco (my wife's favorite restaurant in Phoenix) and Otro, the sister restaurant, doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But it's still a solid choice and a good substitute if you live in the north central area like us.   So far I've had the carne tacos, carne torta and chicken enchiladas. The first  two feature very tasty and well-cooked carne, and I especially liked the torta. The torta comes with onions, guac (more of straight up avocado really), and a killer aji aioli. Simple and perfectly executed.  They also have very good chips and guac. Again the guac is more chunky with solid avocado pieces but I don't mind that at all. The margaritas hit the spot and I would expect nothing less from the Gallo Blanco's \"Other.\"   More recently I tried the enchiladas. After I ordered, my wife reminded me that she had gotten them before and wasn't a fan. I have to say that I must agree. There's no cheese on top, which perhaps is the more sophisticated way to go, but I could barely taste the cheese on the inside. The tortilla itself was kind of soggy. The sauce is more of a salsa, somewhat spicy and fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. The side of black beans was my favorite part. They were very good, but the beans should never be the best part of an entree in my humble opinion (Latin Americans, including my wife, may take offense to that though).  Otro doesn't have the funky charm that Gallo does, but it's coming along. There's a mural on the outside wall of the adjacent building. I noticed on this last trip that they added booths, which makes it feel more put together.   Overall, a good place to get some good, fresh Mexican food and a well-made margarita.",

The last time we were told 10-15 minutes for a table, which was acceptable.  The patio was completely empty, which I asked about a few minutes after putting our names in. The host rudely responded, \"You've only been waiting 6 minutes, I will tell you in ten minutes if you have a table\". 25 minutes of waiting and we got a table.  When we got seated the host commented \"See, I told you ten minutes\".    Generally the staff is very kind, it just takes forever to get food.  I would highly recommend the food. Either order it for carry out, or bring a board game to pass the time.",

Lots of natural lighting, an open design, large booths, and plenty of space.  I brought my tablet with me and ended up staying for quite a while.  The staff were friendly and attentive.    I ordered the half serving of the guac and chips.  Really nice flavor overall and the chips are the harder, fresh kind that I usually get at a local Mexican grocery.  The ice tea (can't remember the name, but similar to passion fruit) had a subtle taste to it which I like.  Sometimes people go overboard with flavoring tea....  I got the carne asada taco and the carnitas taco.  The carnitas came with pineapple which had a nice balance to it.  The carne asada was good as well and the fresh, hot tortilla made everything kind of melt in your mouth.  One note:  The meats weren't particularly hot so I'm guessing it was scooped from a bin.  It probably could have used 30 seconds on the flat top.   I went during Happy Hour and each item was reduced by $1 so the total damage was $12.06, or $15 with tip.  Plenty of food (and refills) for a very lazy lunch day.",

    "text": "I saw it listed as one of the neat new restaurants to try in one of those Phoenix magazines and figured it might be tasty. And besides, as a southern california native, I'm no stranger to good Mexican food. Let's just say I was blown away.  The chips and salsa at a buck is a damn good deal, but you may opt against it if you have a small appetite and are worried about filling up.   Before you correct me, I'm well aware that this is not traditional nor authentic mexican food. Infact, it's pretty obvious from the moment you walk in that it was never the chef's intention to be traditional or authentic. It is truly the work of a visionary that produces such culinary magic.  On our first visit, my girlfriend opted for the Inca salad and a carne asada taco while I went with the chicken paella. The salad is delectable-- the many greens and herbs dance on your tongue and the satisfying crunch of the quinoa keeps you wanting more and more. The carne asada tacos are phenomenal-- better than any I have ever tasted from the most authentic taco stands you can think of. Salty but limey....i dont know how but it was just amazing.  The chicken paella is excellent. The many vegetables, the tenderness of the rice and the perfect amount of seasoning make it a very savory and satisfying dish without being greasy. Just. Damn. Good.  That's not to mention the cool vibe here. Servers are friendly, (if not a bit frazzled at times) and the artwork is neat and modern. Just come here, it's worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.",

Only tea and water was available and refills were slow and without ice.  Food took over an hour to be served.  Chips and salsa helped, but the crowd was hangry.    Product, service and decor were lacking which are usually signs of a new business.  These guys have be open for a while and have experience with other restaurants.  Disappointing.  Won't return.

All their dishes are done with flair and I would say that the quality of the food is a cut above basic Mexican food.  We had the guacamole and it was excellent.  I was disappointed that the chips were too thick and not that tasty and they didn't have the kind of salsa that I typically want with chips.  There salsa was creamier and came out of two plastic tubes.  The margarita was good but not outstanding.  If you want a healthier, higher quality version of Mexican food then this is your place.  However, there are times when I simply crave plain ol' Mexican food and this wouldn't hit the spot.  You decide!",

I love that they have the same elote corn on the cob appetizer as Gallo Blanco, it is the thing that I crave most from their menu. Hubby was very pleased with his torta, which I believe was stuffed with barbacoa meat, and I had the ensalada de la casa, without the meat, because I am a vegetarian. No problems there. The only problem we had was the service - it was a bit lackluster. For a restaurant featured in Phoenix magazine I would have expected a bit more, but it won't stop me from coming back.",

Walking in with a group of twelve we were able to secure 1/2 the patio.  Most of us had been to Gallo Blanco several times so we had some idea what to expect.  Otro is quieter.  General consensus was the food was just as good if not a bit better.  I think they have a bit more freedom with spices not being a hotel restaurant. I had the trio of enchiladas with rice and beans which were all excellent with the only exception of I didn't care for their interpretation of mole.  I had to take my rice and beans with me for lunch the next day.  Because we were starving by this point I had already eaten the enchilada with the verde sauce by the time I remembered to take a picture so I didn't post it because it looks funny.   Not everybody has found Otro yet so there was no trouble getting seated at midday on a Saturday.  Service was good the entire meal.",

The red salsa is smooth with a roasted flavor, with a bit of kick to it. The green salsa is spicy and so tasty. I like the idea that they are served in a bottle that you squeeze. My husband ordered the carne asada tacos. Also very delicious but too small. He had to order another serving of two. The service was exceptional.

If you were to compare a pancake to fabric, these would be 100 % double ply cashmere and what a buy for $7.50.! I was worried when it said on the menu, 2 flap jacks, because while being a small female, I have an enormous appetite (so I'm told :)) But they filled the entire large plate and that glorious \"cojeta\" was crisscrossed all over the top and seemed to soak right into the pancake.

Just goes to show, you really cannot judge a restaurant from its exterior. Went there today with a friend and almost thoroughly enjoyed every Mexican morsel. The House salad was chock full of fresh lettuces, cabbage, herbs, carrots, corn nuts, dried peas, cheese, and eggs, finished with a ranch-style dressing. I could have eaten the entire salad, not wholly certain if that was a function of day after carb-laden Thanksgiving, fresh off a long hike, or it really hit the right notes. Followed this with the veggie chilaquiles and the sauce was a brothy, spicy symphony of flavor. Paired with crispy tortillas and perfectly cooked eggs and I knew I would be back. Solid five stars.   Not content to leave well enough alone, we ordered the coconut pudding topped with a generous serving of shaved chocolate and the lime tart. I like some contrast of textures in my food and these were too much creamy softness for my taste. Next time, we'll explore more of the appetizers and entrees.  But we will be back. Way to go Otro!",

    "text": "Mediocre at best.   Came here for a late Mother's Day lunch with my husband and son. The place was fairly packed so we took it as a good sign. I ordered the trio enchiladas and my husband ordered a carne asada Torta. We were craving tacos as well so we decided to share 3 al pastor tacos. Service was incredibly slow. Yes it was Mother's Day but we had arrived at around 1:30, a time when most of the crowd was dying out and the place wasn't even really packed to begin with.   We waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out and were very disappointed. The black beans had no flavor whatsoever and the rice was also pretty bland. None of the dishes had enough meat. My husband said the torta was okay but did not taste like carne asada. It was mainly bread and hardly any meat. The same with my chicken enchiladas. They hardly had any cheese or chicken. I just kept cutting into tortillas soaked in sauce. When we tried the al pastor tacos.   We saw they incorporated pineapple chunks into it. Again, hardly any meat and most of it was pineapple. They should have been called pineapple tacos. I didn't mind the pineapples in there, but my husband picked them out.   I feel that sometimes, places like these try too hard to be different by changing something that really works into something totally different and disappointing.   Over all, I would not come here again. It's overpriced, bland, Americanized food with not so great service.",

    "text": "This was our first time here but I have been wanting to come for a long time so I had high expectations, unfortunately (or not). We had the chicken chillaquiles, Pork belly taco and the Mexican breakfast with a bottled coke and a mimosa to wash it all down. The best part of our meal was the pork belly taco.  I'll come back to it...  the chilaquiles were not traditional but more of a glorified layered light and crisp tostada.  It was ok but nothing  write home about. The Mexican breakfast was also ok-good but the chorizo didn't have the strong spicy chorizo flavor to it and the beans were just soso. If you're looking for less than spicy chorizo, then this is your place. Now to the pork belly taco. Heaven. If you're a bacon lover than this is one you will want to try. It was perfect just the way it came out... it was 80% fat but it was seared just right, and the flavor was awesome. I almost felt guilty taking a bite. Even with all that... I would definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. The atmosphere was busy, loud and lively... somewhere to meet someone and feel a part of the world. The most disappointing part was that the flies seemed to enjoy the meal as well. I'll write about our desert later as soon as I enjoy it!",

I found the food to be between 3.5 to 4.5 stars, depending on the dish, enough points to earn my revisit. However, the customer service was below 1 star. I read similar reviews stating the food is great but the service sucks, which couldn't be more True. My interaction was with one waitress in particular who forgot our drink order, then forgot our food order, then forgot to bring us chips and water (4 times she mentioned she would get the chips before they actually arrived).   For food, I recommend the carne asada tacos which were delicious. I would pass on the nachos or anything that requires chips to eat since they are not freshly prepared.   For service, I recommend not coming at all. Maybe.. Maybe get it to go if it is offered. But I can't stress enough how bad the service is to warrant a 1 star review    Thank you for reading.",

One thing to keep in mind if you don't like spicy things ask for regular salt around the rim of your margarita the chile salt was too overpowering to me especially after a few sips when the salt would fall from the rim into my drink.",

I was told the chef went over to Otro Cafe.  I eventually found it and went in to get some chips and salsa. First, they neglected to tell me they didn't actually have salsa. They had a green Chile salsa and a Chipotle salsa, but not the typical chunky salsa with tomatoes and such. Second, somehow the chips were stale, yet the bag managed to leave grease stains on my counter at home. The guacamole was good, though. Most people put too much garlic powder in their recipe, but this was just right.  I haven't tried their menu yet, but for the price I paid (like $8) for stale chips and not salsa, I'm not sure I'm willing to venture a night out with friends to overpay for  food that may or may not be quality.",

I asked about Enchiladas for lunch and was told that everything is cooked to order and Enchiladas wouldn't be available. the wait person was trying to explain other items but she was to hard to understand. it was very exasperating trying to order lunch. so we just decided to leave. we had one ice tea, one beer and two drinks. $27.00. this is a truncated version of our experience.

Everyone loved their food.  There was a quinoa salad that my husband couldn't stop raving about.  I found my most perfect combo on the menu; egg, steak, avocado in a torta.  I don't think I've ever been so happy at a brunch spot.  Server was nice, even though she kept forgetting the guacamole that we ordered as a starter.  Problem was quickly resolved when she took it off the bill.  Next time, I need to partake in the drink selection.    Overall, a great spot with a really diverse and well-done menu.  I will definitely return if in the area again.",

I ordered the enchiladas trio and after a couple bites I could tell the similarities to Gallo Blanco. Turns out I'm NOT a fan of Mole winch was one of the 3 enchiladas but the rest tasted good. Oh almost forgot, ordered the guac with the chips and salsa, such a good idea their guac is so delicious!! Of course just like Gallo Blanco they have the squeeze bottles of red and green salsa and of course my wife and I emptied a bottle.

We had ordered the guacamole which was pretty good. My fiance ordered the carne asada tacos which were better than the al pastor tacos I ordered. Mine were bland and dry.   Our waitress however was on another planet. She was one of those waitresses who tried to impress you by taking your order but not writing it down. I have to admit, I do get impressed when waitresses do that, but I'm not impressed when they swing by 15 minutes after taking our order to make sure she remembered it correctly (this was done throughout the night). I also got annoyed how they would offer to bring chips but never did and we also waited forever for our food that should have only taken 10 to 15 minutes to make. FYI: the restaurant wasn't even busy, 8 people were there max on a Monday night at 7:15pm.   Being a foodie, I really dislike writing bad reviews but if I hadn't had such crappy service, or didn't have to wait forever for food that I had ordered, I think I would have had a better experience.",

They are more modern, but still stick to the basics of Mexican cuisine. The atmosphere is really nice I love how open this restaurant is.    Their customer service as always is great. Hostess is very nice and waitresses and waiters are nice and helpful well.   Last time I came here I brought my in laws for some good ol dinner as they were visiting from home (California). We ordered guacamole as our starter and they loved it. For dinner I ordered the black mole which WOW! That dish is amazing and huge you can totally share it with someone. I am SUPER picky with mole (I was surprised I even took the plunge and ordered it) this one passes the test lol. If you love mole please order this!   My in laws ordered the steak plate and chilakiles and they both loved it. \"This hit the spot\" we're their exact words. I also ordered the spike watermelon drink (highly suggested ladies lol) all of their aguas are super delicious! A must try if you love authentic Mexican aguas.   The only downside I had on my last visit was how long it took for us to receive our dinner. They did apologize and I notice they added a discount on our receipt with out us even complaining, so thank you for that we highly appreciate it.   All in all great place to stop by and grab a bite and a few drinks!    PS: flan! If you love flan do me a favor order one you can thank me later!!!",

    "text": "I just found one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We were recommended here by two different friends and it did not disappoint. We started with a local craft beer and the AZ Margarita (no salt) which was yummy. We then tried the Mexican street corn which was sweet, flavorful, and I was tempted to lick the plate. Then we ordered some street tacos; the carne asada, cochita, and chicken. All were very good but we liked the sauce on the chicken best of all. From there we tried the pork belly taco which was amazing! My Fiance ordered a flapjack because hey, why not, and it was fabulous (reheated nicely the next day too!). The featured fish was sea bass so I ordered a fish burrito which comes with their amazing guac inside. As if we hadn't ordered enough food we took home a slice of the banana cream pie that they had on special and devoured that later. Great service at the bar, wonderful happy hour menu before 6pm, and delicious and fresh food options. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!",

I ordered the Chicken chilaquiles With both red and green sauce. Also ordered a side of beans. The Chilaquiles were more of Tostada, Two layered hard shell tortillas with chicken in the middle and eggs on top. It was very good and my only complaint would be that the BEANS were from a CAN, they were awful. Those were NOT fresh beans at all. I would NOT order the beans at all unless you like can beans. The Agua the Sadia was super sweet. It was some type of watermelon syrup at the bottom of a glass with water on top. The syrup and the water stay separate so it looks cool, but you get a mouthful of SUGAR from the bottom of the glass through a straw. I would not order that drink either. Too many other spots in the Valley I would go to before this place again.",

It is big and spacious and buzzing. 15 minute wait to be sat at a table so we slid on over to the bar. Greeted by the bar tender and drinks in hand within minutes. I did not know a thing about the restaurant or its theme so bar tender filled us in. Same owners as the amazing restaurant that use to be located at the Clarendon hotel called Galo Blanca ....  Otro cafe has a great feel and neighborhood vibe! Food was great, service was great and experience was a delight! Put this on your list of places you must check out!!",

Loved the squirt bottles for each (chasing salsa around a bowl with a tortilla chip has never pleased me. Only issue is salsa dried and crusted on tips of squirt bottles is unappetizing and possibly unsanitary, and should be cleaned off. Also, server could have been more attentive about clearing plates.   Guacamole was clearly freshly made, chunky and delicious!  Pork belly Burrito was stellar. Crispy not-too-fatty pork with beans, cheese and picked onions. Wonderful grilled tortilla wrapper.   Try the al fresco dining in the cute back patio!!",

A quick survey: 50% capacity in back, inside the bar was practically open 100%, the inside was about the same. Decided we would hang in the back. Asked Toots to grab a menu. My brother asked the gal in Spanish which table we could sit at. She said to check the front. We thought 'no problem, there is no one here'. Then some angry Beta male came in and told us we were out of line and that all of the tables were reserved except for the one right next to the exit. Which I would call BS. We decided that this place is worthless as it seems they want people of a 'particular appearance'.  Don't waste your money here, go to Harvey's Wineburger and get a real Man's meal. Besides, the ambiance is way better.",

    "text": "For a couple of years, Otro Cafe was sort of a \"holdover\" for my girlfriend and I until Gallo Blanco reopened back up - considering the two restaurants are practically adjoined at the hip. The food is similar, although not quite identical, as she is always quick to point out.  Honestly, I like Otro. Yes, service can sometimes vary greatly, which will probably impact your overall enjoyment. And based on some of the reviews I see, it seems to be a common complaint.   But in terms of the quality of the food they serve here, I feel that Otro is a respectable little restaurant that offers up tacos that have a nice balance between traditional and modern. My favorite being the pork belly, while my girlfriend swears up and down that the carne asada isn't anywhere near the level of what's served as Gallo. I don't think this is a quality issue though, it's merely just different preparation methods.  Starters of guacamole and elote are both decent, as well as beans and rice. In fact, there really isn't anything I've ever had here that I'd call even remotely close to \"bad\" - which says a lot.  What really surprised me about Otro, however, is their burgers. After spotting their pork belly burger on a recent \"Best Burger\" list, I decided to give it a try. I was actually very surprised, as the quality of virtually everything in the burger completely threw me off, despite being fairly simple. In terms of finding a good burger, who knew that I'd find one here of all places?  Otro's flapjacks, which can either be ordered in dessert form (cajeta-style) or as a side with syrup and butter, are pretty much identical to what you'll find at Gallo. They come off more like crepes than they do pancakes, having a very eggy texture to them. Me? I like them. My girlfriend? Not so much.   Okay. So, I still think Gallo is better. But guess what? If I can obtain a well-rounded meal of starters, tacos (or a burger), as well as a flapjack for dessert, I see absolutely no reason to not give Otro a solid four star rating.",

    "text": "Ours was a large Fathers Day brunch group, 13 in all. The food was very well prepared but the service was a mess. Lengthy waits and food delivery mis-coordination were experienced throughout the meal. We ordered chips & guacamole and the chips were delivered 15 minutes before the guac. By that time most the chips were gone. Two in our party didn't get their brunch order for at least 30 minutes after everyone else were served and done eating. My granddaughters were splitting an order of pancakes, something I wouldn't think could take 30 more minutes than the chilaquiles.  Most of this rests on the kitchen, but at some point I would have appreciated it if our server would have been a lot more determined to get the rest of our order out. I would have also expected the front management to have taken notice at some point but that never happened.  All in all, food not good enough to outweigh the service experience.",

Inside proved to be more aesthetically pleasing and the aromas from the kitchen peaked my senses. We were greeted & seated quickly in a booth by a window  with a view of the alley in between buildings. Phoenix street art decorating the adjacent wall.   Upon opening my linen napkin which held my silverware I found 2 dirty utensils, dried food still attached. Our waiter apologized and brought me a clean set.   Our food was delivered promptly, Huevos Rancheros, my husband's favorite Mexican dish and a pair of street tacos; fish and chicken a la cart. The Huevos Rancheros were generously sized as apposed to my petite tacos. They were also tasty with all the right spices also not like my tacos. The chicken was scarce and had an odd, boiled texture and the fish tacos were very fishy and had little other flavor happening.   I had a draft beer & my husband a Bloody Mary which brought our bill to $40 not including tip. Bottom line? Definitely Not worth a $40 lunch.",

Very tasty. The roasted beets and turnips were all locally sourced. They were a mix of sweet and tart. Never really had anything like it. Darn good.

They had a family opening last week and a pre-opening this week.  So the menu is limited.  The real opening starts next week.  Chef Robson is once again using his childhood experiences to create an excellent flavor profile that shines.  There is also a full bar with wine, beer, and liquor.  I ordered the al pastor torta.  My waitress brought me out two salsas and a bowl of chips.  The tomatillo salsa was excellent.  Perfect amount of lime balanced with a bit of heat.  The other salsa was red and had a great flavor as well.  My torta came out next.  It was just the right size.  Big enough to fill me up but not some gigantic gimmick of a sandwich.    The first thing I noticed was the pork was shredded with a beautiful bark to it.  The next thing that stood out was the pineapple relish that blended in the aioli and lettuce perfectly.  Sweet and savory.  I've eaten pounds of al pastor and am very familiar with chopped up pineapple and cilantro and onion garnishing but this was something much better.  It was a sweet juicy blend that was married together to compliment each other.  I added some of each salsa to give it a little heat.  The bread was soft and wonderful.  Probably the best bread I've ever had a torta with.  What really stood out is how the food tasted different than Gallo and more than held its own while at the same time you can tell it came from the same palate.  I am looking forward to trying more.  This place is about to blow up as soon as word gets out.  I say get in while the gettin's good.",

    "text": "There is no sign on the building yet, but the doors are open and the friendly staff at Otro will happily feed you!  I went some co-workers yesterday for lunch, we were one of just two tables, but I don't think that will happen again once word gets out that Otro Cafe is open, and is the sister restaurant to Gallo Blanco, a Phoenix favorite.   The interior is crisp, open and highlights the buildings natural architecture, with exposed beams and brick.  There are a mix of booths and tables and a huge patio out front that will be perfect for sipping margaritas.  After sitting down we were given a huge bowl of chips and two salsas, a red and a green.  The chips were warm and slightly salted, they were on the thick side, but still tasty.  I prefer a thinner, crispier chip, but it is really just personal preference.  The green salsa is bright and tangy, and the milder of the two, while the red one is thicker and robust with chile flavor.  My group went through about 3 bowls of each during our lunch, so they are definitely memorable.  The menu is limited right now, but they plan to double it after things get rolling.  It has a unique blend of modern Mexican dishes along with familiar items, like tacos and guacamole.  We tried the Mexican Paella, which had great flavor, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side.  We also tried the El Pastor tacos and the Tacos el Carbon.  The tacos are served on homemade flour tortillas that just melt in your mouth.  The pastor was very flavorful, and I loved the addition of the pineapple for a bit of sweet, it really elevated the flavor.  The el Carbon tacos were served with a chimichurri sauce that was also flavorful.  We also orderd a small side of guacamole, which for $3 was huge and some of the best I have head, definitely the best value on the menu.  I really enjoyed my meal and can't wait to see the menu expand and grow.  One of my dining companions said that they prefer the tacos at Gallo Blanco, he liked that meat selections better there...but I pointed out that these are sister restaurants and not the same....so they had to change up the menu a bit!  I think Otro Cafe is going to have great success, the food is delicious and it is located in the hot 7th Street corridor...I will definitely be back.",

I have been here about 5 times now and each time I go I enjoy something new. The menu is varied to the point where I feel like I have room to breathe in all the excellent smells coming from their expo kitchen. I have tried the chicken, the salmon, various tacos and a few specials. The food does not ever disappoint. The only issue I have is sometimes i like being spontaneous and on the weekends, this place can get busy and you have to wait... and wait... and wait... if the bar was more than 8 seats it would make things a bit more relaxed. But that's how he likes to do it... small, casual and cozy... so I'll still go back!",

Not so much. A month went by and no gift certificate. I contacted the owner again and was told \"sure! We'll get that right out to you.\"  A few weeks later and nada.

The drinks were tangy and cold and the chips showed up quickly.  Fresh, hot, salty chips were just delish.  Love the green tomatillo sauce but the other sauce seared my tongue.  I am no lightweight when it comes to spices but, holy cow, I had to give up!    We ordered the corn and the guac and they were really fresh and yummy tasting....mixed together, they were just sublime.  I had the shrimp tacos, brother 1 had the veggie torta, and brother 2 had the polla asodo.  We had great service and, even with a very generous tip, made it out of there at about 23 bucks a person with drinks.  Some suggestions:  (I won't quibble about wait times...I know you're getting up and running).  Bring a variety of sauces to the table.  We all agreed that our food was kind of naked and this is a great opportunity to expose diners to more of your delicious recipes.  I didn't get any sauce on my tacos and distinctly remember that as being the best part!    Expand the menu a bit to include more appetizers (sorry, but I just dig the Chicharron de Queso for the novelty alone).  The neighborhood is starting to fill up with Mexican joints so this will help you stay competitive.  Lastly, do a little sound dampening; you won't need much but this will help since it's heating up outside.  We'll all be back,I'm sure.  Smooches!",

    "text": "I love that more and more empty storefronts in strip malls are being re-purposed. And especially when a new eatery goes in, right?   Otro is the brainchild of Doug Robson of Gallo Blanco fame (another awesome restaurant in Central Phoenix) and showcases his amazing talent for preparing Mexican cuisine; but don't expect Otro to be a clone of Gallo Blanco. The space has a lot of exposed brick, and lots of windows/skylights. The kitchen is open to the dining area and there is an atmosphere of urban energy, yet comfortable and unpretentious.  A friend and I met up at Otro for lunch, and we both ordered the Asado Chicken Salad. This is not your average greens with sliced chicken breast....boring. This salad was packed with flavor. The spices on the grilled chicken was so flavorful, but not overpowering. The greens included spinach, shredded cabbage and romaine. There were chunks of apples which added a great texture and complimented the chicken. The dressing was a peanut vinaigrette which added another layer of flavor.  This is definitely a place worth returning to, either for a weekend breakfast, happy hour or dinner!",

We showed up at 800pm and they said they did not have a reservation for me. the hostess asked \"are you sure you didn't call Ohso?\" ummmm yes i'm sure. I showed them the number i called and the hostess said that it was correct.  She then said \"well sometimes my manager doesn't write down reservations if we aren't that busy.\" (okay....) They were not busy at all so they were still able to seat us. We sat on the patio, which is pretty standard for a restaurant patio, but there was no music so the ambiance was a little weird.   We ordered drinks and an app to start and the app came before the drinks. we also had no silverware or napkins. i asked the waitress but she never returned with them so i just stole them from another table.  We had the queso fundido with chorizo which was good.  I ordered enchiladas, husband had mole, and my friend had carne asada burrito i want to say. my enchiladas were really spicy, which was unexpected. i had the red sauce (red or green you can choose). i ate half of one and some of the rice and beans. Way too spicy.  Husband said chicken mole was okay. my friend liked her burrito.  The waitress didn't keep up well on drinks, water, clearing plates, but she seemed like she had a lot of tables. I had the flan for dessert which i thought was pretty good.",

    "text": "The mole chicken was so disappointing I would never return to this restaurant for anything else.  There was a half bone-in chicken stacked in the center of a very small plate with rice and vegetables on either side.  The chicken would have been hard to cut as it was stacked in pieces with no room to put part of it on the dish- it was even harder to cut as it was tough.  Cutting gently the vegetables and rice went flying off the plate. The mole was more like a heavy glaze painted on the chicken after it was cooked and it was hard to tell what flavors were even in it; it probably would have been better to cut the chicken in small pieces and actually cook it in the mole.  The rice was seasoned with spices I had not tasted before and had an unpleasant flavor- didn't seem like a Mexican food recipe to me.  The vegetables were mushy and unidentifiable.    We were given lunch menus at dinner time and it took about 10 minutes to get someones attention to get dinner menus.  The music was so loud it was not possible to have a conversation during dinner.  The server did an OK job but not good enough to give this place more than one star.",

My huevos was served on fresh made tortillas formed into a thin quesadilla.  The sauce was fresh very well seasoned without being over powering.  The salsa they serve with the chips is fresh made in house daily, and you can taste it.  The V8 for my bloody mary was also freshly made, with a great flavor (not too tomato heavy, not too spicy, just perfect with lots of fresh herbs).   I am pretty sure they put crack in the food here. So yummy!  Now stop reading this a go EAT already!",

A) Don't ask if I want a water refill...fill my water...all the time, we live in the desert  B) Veggie paella sounds amazing, but was ridiculously salty...see A.  C)Servers need to help each other out and operate full hands in, full hands out.  Don't come out with the check, then come back a few minutes later with box, then a few minutes later with the check.  I think you can multitask.  Apart from these minor complaints (constructive criticism)...  The inca salad was AMAZING, loved every bite.  Chips were fair, but the red and green sauces were really good, although not very spicy.  I will definitely be coming back for the elote and probably enchildas.  All in all, this is a great space in the neighborhood with a unique menu and excellent potential.",

The salsa comes in those squeeze tubes which I cannot stand! It makes me feel like my hands are dirty each time I have to put salsa on each chip. I like to dunk my chips into the salsa and I can't do that here. Therefore, only four stars.  There are ample vegetarian options available. They have good salad and daily vegetable selections. Their iced tea is also very good! If you like pop, they have Mexican coke (in the bottle, made with real sugar).",

The handmade, warm, soft tortillas practically melt in your mouth. My favorite are the carne asada and the pork belly.. I've also tried their grilled fish taco and it is delicious as well! Their guacamole is delicious and what really puts the cherry on top are the chips and absolutely delicious salsas... I haven't tried too many things on the menu but honestly you can't wrong with the tacos... So that's the food.  The service is also outstanding! Our waiter never let our drinks get empty, our chips were refilled, and our food came out promptly. 5 very well deserved stars",

    "text": "Aye I really wanted to like this place. We were celebrating a birthday last night and my boyfriend is really picky about food (and also a vegetarian). I literally found this place by googling \"Best Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix\" then going through that list and seeing who had the largest vegetarian selection. Otro Cafe won with a large option of Vegetarian dishes plus they had elote and mole, both dishes I used to love growing up in El Paso that not many restaurants out here have!  It was a Wednesday night around 8pm, the wait wasn't horrible and they had a flamenco dancer performing so we sat inside. All the tables were completely full when we first sat down so the service was understandably slow, it took about 10min just to get our drink order then another 10min to actually get the drinks. In taking in everything and asking about what vegetables they use for the vegetarian dishes, they definitely gave off a hipster vibe. The veggie list changes slightly but they had a mix of Kale, Greenbeans, onions, chili pepper, mushrooms, sometimes carrots and asparagus, either way not a list that screams authentic Mexican at all. But thankfully my boyfriend reluctantly gave it a shot.   We started off with a small Guac, nice simple delicious, as well as the Elote which was AMAZING but not worth the $7 price tag. I still highly recommend it so if you give the elote a try, after they cut the corn off the cob for you at your table...take a look at that oh so delicious (but tiny!!) little pile and think, $7 really? That would probably not even fill a little white cup that you'd normally get back in the good ol days.  We were still very hungry and anxious for the full meal and that's when my fears that the other lesser star reviews on here were right...the service was SSSLLOOOOOOOWWW! But we'll get back to that.  The food arrived and looked great! However one bite of their \"rice\" and I quickly got a sour face, looking over at my boyfriend he had the same expression. Worried, I slowly cut into my Chicken Mole and it was...definitely an acquired taste. Nothing like what my Grandma used to make and she's from Mexico! I tried to describe it as a bitter charcoal taste, or like they tried too hard to make it unique and used every herb and spice they could find. I scooped off little samples of the paste for everyone else to try so they could share in my sorrow and they agreed. It was way to overwhelming to eat so I just tried to make the best out of this whopping $24 dish and at least eat the chicken underneath. Even that was trying. The chicken was very dry and unseasoned, I felt bad for the person who was paying for my meal as I couldn't even finish it. My boyfriend's veggie enchiladas didn't fare any better, it was like everything was completely overpowering, unbalanced and sauces/rice were flavored to hell.   We were left still very hungry :( So we hoped to order dessert for our birthday celebration and save the night, I mean how can you screw up dessert? From the time it took us to ask for the dessert menu, get it, and the waitress finally come back to ask what we wanted it had been 30 MIN! at that point we just said forget it, it was 9:30 and by the time we would have gotten the dessert who knows.  My goodness the efficiency of our waitress was horrendous. She kept saying \"thanks for your patience\" but after each time it felt disingenuous considering that at about 8:30 half of the inside tables were completely empty and stayed that way.  We sat waiting for the check, for what felt like forever, I was tempted several times to just go to the front and ask someone to ring us out. Comments from the party about just wanting to get out of there left everyone anxious and pissed off on the poor wait times for simple little things, I was as well. What a sad birthday, couldn't even enjoy a dessert because the service was extremely lacking. Usually most restaurants, at a normal pace, can easily have you in and out in an hour. We were stuck there for over 2hrs!  Overall I struggled to give this place even 1star, it was mainly just on the environment w/ a live performance and that overpriced addicting elote. But I know because of everything else we won't be back. I felt bad for recommending we try this place so good luck, you'll need it!",

It was Saturday night, 730pm and I was met with a 45 minute wait for a 4-top table... wow.  Okay.  Probably similar to the rest of town.  We were sat right about at the 45 minute mark. Great! So we sit with our menus discussing how yummy everything looks... and discussing, and discussing, and looking at the drink menu, and discussing.... Maybe 10-12 minutes goes by and a server finally makes her way over.  She takes our drink order and we also order the child's meal and drink (best to feed kids stat).  We go back to the menu and chatting.  Server comes back a good 7-8 minutes later with drinks ready to take our order. Forgot the kid's milk, so we reminded her.  We skip appetizers due to having already waited an hour, and just get right to ordering the entrees.  Ordering goes off without a hitch and the server goes to place the order .... Or so we thought? Approx 30 minutes goes by and the server appears with food ... Not our food though. She doesn't drop it, she instead goes to the correct table after staring at it quite puzzled. Another 15 minutes... Still no food.  She comes by and says it should be right out.  The manager comes over and says \"the kitchen got backed up\" ... This was just not True.  We watched 2 other tables and people who came in after us at the bar get their food before we did.  Finally one dish comes out and they bring 2 of our rice sides (probably just to put some food in front of us). Couple mins later the last 2 entrees appear ... About few more minutes later the last 2 sides of beans arrive.  I forgot I was even waiting on beans.  It was 930 by now and we were all pretty tired.  Its too bad they got all screwed up, because the food was good.  But all we could wonder was what really happened with our order?  You would think they'd offer us a dessert or round of drinks, but it was pretty unapologetic. Front of the house blamed the back of the house, and that's pretty crappy.  Questionable whether I'd return or recommend Otro.  If I made my way back, I would sit at the bar where I could watch my order be placed, and eat in a timely manner with my server never more than 10 feet away.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Otro Cafe last Thursday at 11:40 a.m.  We had heard that the food was good, so when the hostess who seemed really stressed out said the wait for food was 30 to 40 minutes, we agreed and sat down to people watch.  People watching was at least good. We waited for forty five minutes as more and more people who came in before us were seated and served.  We were finally led to a table at 12:30.  The server was a pleasant young gal and she took our drink order.  I just had water; my husband ordered water and a diet coke.  Well, 15 minutes later we got our water.....the diet coke never came.  After we ordered, we continued to watch as table after table that had also got there after us was served and paid and left. WE asked the bus boy to please bring my husband's Diet Coke----he never did.  We ended up leaving without eating at 1:30.  We had gotten no diet coke and no food.  The manager spoke to us as we left just outside the front door and assured us that my husband's diet coke was ready----not that our food was ready---but our diet coke that we had waited 45 minutes for was ready.  She said that certain foods took different spaces to cook.  But my husband replied that all he had ordered was a green chille burro and, that that is a staple on any Mexican food bill of fair and doesn't take one hour and 30 minutes to prepare.  And he also said we had seen lots of specially and elaborately looking dishes already served, eaten and paid for.  WE were really disappointed and, needless to say, will not return.",

Coffee is good and service has always been friendly and never felt rushed. Sometimes there is a wait to get a table. Wish they had more bar space for those busy times.  There's no blueberry pancake option (my personal preference), but we keep going back anyway. Breakfast burrito is one of the best in town as well.   The all day menu has pancakes and chilaquiles as well, however the pancake on all day menu comes with chocolate chips. Depending on restaurant volume, they may serve them special order without the chocolate.  Fun atmosphere and art as well. Lots of music in the evenings. Please keep it up!!",

There was a large party, 8 maybe, being especially raucous, at the back and the place was very noisy.  We weren't quite ready to order the first time the waiter stopped, but then we couldn't get his help when we were ready and asked another person.  One of our party had to leave and take her lunch with her, she had an appointment.  My spring rolls and shrimp tacos were good; liked the grilled flavor of the shrimp.  Will try a burger next time, reviewers say they are good.  It was a very nice surprise to be offered a free dessert in compensation for us waiting for our bill.  The Limon tart (?) was really tasty, could've been more tart for my taste,but a nice large piece and tart enough.  I've wanted to visit here for quite awhile now, I drive by it often and will come back again.",

My salad was interesting but tasty! The base of greens was made up of a bunch of different herbs including basil, cilantro, and mint. The salad also had quinoa, craisins, pepitas, cherry tomato, avocado, and corn on it. Each bite was different based on what herb you got on your fork!

One might compare Otro with Joyride Tacos a few streets away; I could confidently say Otro blows Joyride out of the water. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Was in the area and looking for a breakfast spot, and Otro had good reviews. A nice open space with several tables as well as a few booths. We were able to get a table for 2 immediately around 9:30am on a Saturday but it was pretty full.   The brunch menu has a good selection of options for different tastes, and the lunch menu is served after 11am. I ended up ordering the huevos rancheros and my girlfriend got the granola and yogurt plus a side of two eggs.    The huevos rancheros were great. You select which kind of eggs you want on top and if you want red or green sauce. I chose green and was very happy with the flavor. The side of beans was also awesome, definitely some of the best beans I've had. I wasn't too full but content with the portion size and thought price was very reasonable.   The granola and yogurt was a large portion and the granola was tasty. There were nuts mixed in as opposed to just granola and made for a great crunch.   Our server was friendly and made sure to check up on us. I enjoyed the atmosphere although it is a little loud (god I sound old!) because of the concrete floors and brick walls. Nothing too crazy though.   I would definitely return for lunch again. I recommend checking it out!",

I've tried a few things on the menu and by far the stand out has to be those tacos!     The bartenders make amazing drinks as well.  I like to drink cucumber gimlets at a bar with fresh ingredients (no Roses Lime for me!).  They make one of the best because the ingredients are fresh.  Amazing kids menu too.  Return Factor:100%",

To the perfect spicy Bloody Mary (seriously, it was pretty perfect), the homemade tortillas (to die for), and very flavorful dishes overall, I really think you can't go wrong.  Two standouts for us so far have been the Barbacoa & Eggs (slow-roasted beef served with beans, guacamole, tortillas and salsa) and the Chilaquiles (baked layered tortilla dish - try it Christmas style with both red and green sauce). Both dishes were spot on for flavor, and just good hearty dishes overall.  Shout out to our server Seth to taking awesome care of us!  He was a great mix of personal, funny and really knew the menu well. His carefree having-the-best-day-of-his-life attitude was greatly appreciated and we enjoyed being in his section :)  A++ and can't wait to come back again and try dinner sometime!",

    "text": "Gallo Blanco set a high bar and Otro grabs onto the bar here and there but cant really pull itself up to it. Terrific in spots, lagging in others, overall just okay. Kudos for carving out the pleasant open interior, but the service, atmosphere and even the food here dont consistently match the flagship. That somewhat reluctant observation hardly rises to the level of condemnation, more like mild disappointment, and is based on a handful of visits to both locations.  Servers downtown are/were hip and more importantly, sharp, anticipating needs, recommending condiments, invested in their guests' satisfaction. At Otro, it feels tenser and more transactional, like you're a tab instead of a guest. There's just less professional and personal confidence here and you're less likely to get your iced tea refilled or thanked on your way out. I realize they're going for casual, but casual should be a personality or flair, not a tangible reduction in customer service. Not in this market and age, especially not with Gallo's pedigree,   I also prefer Gallo's menu, although there's considerable overlap. Companions claim food here is comparable, so maybe it's what you order and who you are. Otro's homemeade paella had too much salt or onions, for me, and tasted more packaged than savory. I had a torta there where the filling was fine but the bun evoked McDonalds, like they ran out of better buns. The chiliquiles here is rojo and the lopsided tower tended to fall apart.   I prefer (adore, is more accurate) the expertly assembled verde downtown.  Our party agreed the  biscuit, banana and plaintain dessert was awful. Not expensive, but the least satisfying dessert we've had out in a long time.   I like the big, thick chips they serve with the guac. They pour a big glass of wine. There's quaint, thoughtful seating in the foyer in case there's a wait.  And I love any North Central spot with spacious DIY parking, sans valets. That almost feels retro now, like hitching your horse up in front of Monti's Casa Vieja a hundred years ago. You might even score a shady spot out back this summer.

Very small print and nothing is defined, so it took me a while to order. I struggled to find something I would like. Nothing very traditional on the menu and most was a la cart. The service was extremely slow. I had lost my appetite by that the time my meal came. I settled on a burrito. It took over 30 min to get something this simple. I find the menu to be pricey and the Happy hour selections not very defined on the menu. I had to ask about HH, the waitress never volunteered that info. The check came and it had errors. She forgot to put in HH pricing. WTF?!. It took over 20 minutes to get the right bill. I was not pleased and it was not worth the money spent. I can get a burro anywhere, fast and hot, with rice and beans included. I won't return to any place messing with my $. Lol",

Fresh juice in a house marg? Yes please!  Oh and the rice- the side of rice- is the most amazing veggie paella. It could be a meal all by itself.

It's a very casual spot, and not romantic, but is great for a low-key meal or dinner with a group. Most everything served here is local and prepared fresh daily. You can definitely tell!  The Inca salad is wonderful; so many unexpected flavors. Add shrimp for a healthy and satisfying lunch. If you are ready to splurge-- the BLT & A is a MUST!

I started with some yummy guac and despite the fact that it was a million degrees out I was so utterly compelled to try the chicken soup and I'm so glad I did. The small order was huge with rice noodles and chunks of white meat in a delicous broth. The BEST thing about the soup is that they serve basil, cilantro, peppers and spicy soy sauce to season to your taste.....part of me wished it was cold and I was sick so that I have it cure me......I know I'm a sick bastard.  I finished up with carne asada and shrimp tacos (shrimp aren't my favorite, truth be told!) and a side of black beans. I really enjoyed my meal and my sever was so sweet and friendly. The ONLY thing they didn't have which I was so looking forward to was the chicarron de queso, the awesome cheese crisp they serve at Gallo Blanco. I REALLY hope they add this to the menu.  So glad these guys are here because Gallo Blanco can get crowded.",

It was nice and quiet and we could enjoy our time together. The chicken paella was awesome! I would highly recommend it. We have had the tacos at GB so didn't go that route and tried a burrito. We shoulda stuck with the tacos, they are awesome. So next time we will. But get the paella!",

The restaurant looks very unassuming outside, as it's in the middle of a strip mall, but the decor is cute as soon as you step through the door. Everything from the service to the food was fantastic. We tried the guac (super fresh onions, roasted garlic, chunky avocado, awesome touch with the white cheese on top, a slight kick), three different types of tacos (the veggie ones were amazing), and a side of roasted cauliflower (verrry interesting!).   And since no Mexican restaurant is complete in my book unless they serve chips and salsa on the house, I was happy to note the cauldron of chips arrived immediately and without prompting. Their chips were pretty standard, but both the red and green salsas were excellent. The green salsa was heavy on the cilantro, really addicting, and tasted like it was made to order. Ugh, seriously, no complaints! And the kicker... every Monday is a happy Monday, with happy hour all day and all night: $3 drafts, $1 off select menu items, and $5 select cocktails and wines.",

The acoustics are far better than at The Clarendon, so you can hear your companion speak.  The waiters also seem far happier to be there than those at GB.  We had chips and guacamole which was good and fresh.  Split a quinoa salad which was really good and colorful, had great dressing and freshness.  We each had a couple of tacos.  I had carne asada and al pastor; my companion the fish.  Everything was good.

    "text": "This is our first time. We got there and there were quite a few people waiting. We were told there would be about a 35 minute or more wait. That would have been ok, except as I looked in the restaurant there were many many empty tables and an island with place settings and chairs set up, but no one sitting. I find that really annoying. The only thing I could think of is that they did not have enough waiting staff, or their kitchen staff aren't able to keep up when they need to service a full house. Regardless, it doesn't make for a great impression or mood when at least I see this type of situation. When we got seated we were greeted very warmly.I really like the decor, which is clean and modern.  I ordered a Sangria which was about the best tasting Sangria I've ever had. However, there was more ice than Sangria. A couple of draws on the straw and it was gone. When the server came and asked how everything was I told her I really liked the taste of the Sangria, but felt like I was spending $10 for a class of ice with very little actual Sangria in it. She looked very embarrassed, apologized, and left. The good news is she came back with another Sangria which was more Sangria than ice. You really can't ask for more than that. Now for the food. I had Paella  and my wife had lamb ribs. Both were delicious. So I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to what I've told you about. But those things will not stop me from coming back. To many other things I want to try. Oh, and there is this really nice looking patio I want to sit at to enjoy our great AZ weather.",

Usually you can count on Mexican restaurants to have vegan dishes and they made it easier to find those items with a green \"V\" next to them and a note at the bottom of the menu that those items could be made Vegan or vegetarian.  However, I was disappointed that the menu had the corn tamales listed with one of these V's, but when I asked the waitress to order it without cheese she replied that this could not be done.  I ended up ordering a pinto bean burrito which was not on the menu, but was very good.  I did have to eat it with a fork though as it was quite runny.  We ordered French press coffee after our meal so we could sit and digest for a bit and I discovered that they do not have soy or almond milk either.",

I have a business within walking distance of Otro and we frequently order lunch to go. The Inca salad was my favorite with an amazing blend of flavors and textures - quinoa, pepitas, yulu seeda, a bit of the elote corn, cranberries and surprising tastes of mint and basil. The dressing with the accompanying half lime was a perfect complement.  2 weeks ago, a friend and I ordered the Inca salad with chicken (on my recommendation ). The chicken was half raw and I  called to complain. Whoever answered the phone asked us to bring the salads back for an exchange.  When I explained that my lunch break was over I was offered a gift certificate for  $25 to be emailed to my phone. 3 days later I called because I hadn't received the certificate.  They apologized and asked again for my email address.  I  called 4 times over the course of 2 weeks. I never got a certificate from Otro,  so I decided to walk over and see what the problem was. After much blame passing,  I finally got the certificate.  Several days later,  we ordered lunch with the certificate. The Inca salad was missing several key  ingredients and when we called to complain,  Otro asked us to carry the salad  back for inspection. They explained that there was a miscommunication with the chef, who failed to notify them that certain ingredients had run out. They offered me extra chicken and blueberries,  which aren't even part of the salad. I used to love this restaurant but after this poor treatment,  (and for the sake of brevity, I'm not including several other mishaps, including a shrimp ceviche without a drop of shrimp ) I won't return.",

And the el pastor....oh my goodness! Pork belly marinated with pineapple chunks...wow! I like their house sauces as well. We are at the bar and the girl was so pleasant. Would definitely come back. We came during lunch but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It would also make a fun place to go for dinner.",

Get the pork belly taco(s)!  All tacos are very tasty, but the pb stand out.  Just had the Inca salad with grilled shrimp... Delicious!  Outro does it right.  Oh...

Their drink menu is pretty awesome too.  The space and concept are fabulous as well....  I want so badly to be able to call this my favorite restaurant and come back frequently but I have to say the service each time has been extremely \"awkward\" and it took asking the server 3 times on our last visit just to get water and 2 times to make sure our guacamole order was in. Previous visits were just as frustrating-including the time we ate at the bar. In fact, we had guacamole technical difficulties on a prior visit as well..  I get that it is a loud restaurant but servers should be able to work around that and make sure they clarify orders. I have honestly never seen such a confused staff.  It is frustrating because I feel like this restaurant is on the cusp of being something fantastic but they haven't quite pulled it together. I mean any other place I would not have returned after the sloppy service but the location, premise and food are that good!   Ok Otro...I am going to give you one more try. OK...maybe 2 more tries...The burning question remains...is the end result (the food) worth the hassle/frustration of getting to the amazing food? That remains to be seen...",

    "text": "This place was so great my boyfriend wanted me to write a positive review for him lol. It's not traditional mexican food but everything is fresh and they try to get as much local product as possible. The restaurant itself is nice very simple with a slight industrial feel with lots of windows for natural light. Everything is spaced out well so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the person at the next table. They really took the time to lay everything out. It is in a weird location but that doesn't seem to deter the many people that kept coming in maybe it was the wood you smell from their grill which automatically makes your mouth water when you walk in the door. So with that here's what we decided to eat:  ensalada de la casa (house salad)- we got the big size to share and it is plenty for 2. they perfectly dress it (which for the both of us is a big deal because we both work in kitchens) and the flavors are light and meld well together for the combination of things they have in it (serrano ham, little spanish green olives, goat cheese, tomato and red onion) . My only criticism is the croutons, to me, were not that but the bread they use has a nice chewy crust so I can forgive that. According to my boyfriend you can't win friends with salad but this one he can make an exception  we both had tacos al pastor (pork) and carne asada  the al pastor was so tender and they grill fresh pineapple for it which in my book wins every time  the carne asada was juicy and full of flavor with a generous dollop of of smashed avocado  we also got sides which I recommend just make sure you ask what the first 3 are because they change according to what they get from that particular vendor.   So I got maya's farms veggies which consisted of yellow squash and zucchini that they grilled and tossed with sliced garlic lemon and shishito peppers. Amazing  My boyfriend got the arroz frito which was their take on fried rice. They stir fry it with a ton of fresh veggies and I think they may use bacon fat but don't hold me to that  There was no disappointment here just wish we were there for happy hour but we were an hour too early. Maybe next time since they seem to have a ton of items that they give discounts on. We will definitely return again again.",

We waited about 10 minutes for a table which was fine, they were pretty busy and had a large table reserved. Ordered the Bloody Mary which uses a house made mix. It was really good, heavy on fresh dill so if dill isn't your thing I would order something else but we both enjoyed it. Guacamole for an appetizer was delicious. Nice and chunky, extremely simple but delicious. The chips and guacamole were served with 2 salsas a fire roasted salsa and a green salsa. They were to die for. For lunch I ordered a vegetarian burrito and a quinoa salad and I was very happy. I already want to go back.",

Not our first time here either, and both times we spent waaaayyyy too much time waiting for our food.  Tonight it was literally an hour and forty five minutes from sit-down to finally getting our check.  Our waitress acted like she was, smoking a little something out back between tables.

It's a great little casual dining spot with delicious food and awesome ambiance; it's perfect for a date. If you're a fan of Gallo Blanco, you're going to be familiar with what Otro has to offer.  Mexican beer, wine, cocktails, tacos, chips, guacamole and tasty salsas... All were had, and all were yummy. The al pastor and carne asada tacos are choice! While the al pastor was sweet and savory, the carne asada was tender and scrumptious! They know what they're doing, so you shouldn't be disappointed with Otro's taco game. Complementary chips and salsas are always a nice touch, and when paired with Otro's freshly made guacamole, be prepared for food baby status because you won't be able to stop picking at them! With all that goodness shared, I have one gripe.. I ordered a michelada, and Otro's only comes with beer and lime juice. I was hoping for some spicy tomato juice with it, but c'est la vie...  Otro is worth a visit, and I'll be back in the near future for sure. I'm already craving some of those delicious tacos and salsas. To all my foodies, get off your butts and go check it out.",

Everything is al-a-cart at Otro. My $12 omelet came w/ no toast, potatoes nada. It's not like we ate a lot either, between us we had- 1-ice tea, 1-oj, 1-omelet,4 fried eggs,1 side breakfast potatoes, 3 strips bacon, a 2\" piece of sausage(which they consider a side)- and THAT WAS IT.  Needless to say we were still hungry after we ate (oh yeah, my friend's 4 fried eggs did not come out together- 2 eggs, then 3-4 minutes later another 2 eggs, really?).... I've been in the business for years and one of the many mistakes  restaurant owners' make is being cheap- the profit margin on breakfast is huge-  Hey guys , are things so bad that you can't cough up some toast + home fries w/ breakfast like every other eatery in town?  But we are lucky in my neighborhood and Phx in general because we have many choices of places to eat. I know where I won't be eating again. Have a great day y'all!",

LOVE the Owner and Chef, Doug All four meals were GREAT!!!  I found California Sea Bass, a delicious ocean fish that you can only find in California as far as I know, and the torta was perfectly layered, and had a wonderfull wood fired smell!!  The tacos were just as good.  The Mexican Paella was completely original, and Full of flavor!! The only thing I think could be improved is how difficult it is to see this place from the street (at least for us).  Maybe add a larger 2nd sign? Still, a FIVE STAR food experience!  Also, the service was really great this time!! They also have FLAMENCO night !!!",

If you are looking at reviews, considering dining here, just get in the car and come.  It's good, and you will like it.",

The guacamole  was good but I like it spicy with some fresh jalapenos.  My breakfast  burrito was a little saucy . We did like the fish tacos. It was noisy and had trouble  hearing the waitress",

We also tried the queso fundido, which we aren't as crazy about, because the cheese seemed a bit too thick and hardened too quickly when it cooled. Then we tried four of the tacos - the pork, chicken, carne asada and the shrimp, all of which were very good and very different. For dessert, we tried the Dulce de Leche Flan - very rich and full of flavor. We found the service to be very good. We will definitely return.",

On that note, I've experienced more than one slightly off waitress. They're just aloof enough to bug you. I guess the decor is nice. I like the paintings by local artists and the patio would be nice in cooler weather. Not that I'll go back to find out.",

We got here at 1145ish on a Monday, and had no problems getting a table. I ordered a coke and was offered bottle or fountain. The fountain is on a meh level, but I've had a LOT worse so I didn't mind.  So like I said we ordered before the lunch rush came in (by 1215 it was full with people waiting to be seated. It took us 30 minutes to get the Steak and Apple salad and 3 tacos.   But they arrived finally and OMG, the steak was amazing. Now I forget which was which but the one with the potatoes and mushrooms was absolutely AMAZING. I wasn't thrilled with the 3rd choice. I could eat another one of the 2 I liked, bit not willing to sit for another 30 minutes to get it!!!  The salad was good. There were no complaint. I also got the side of mixed veggies and ate most of that. And I'm not a veggie person so I'm pretty proud of myself. Was an excellent sauce that it was all cooked down in.   We passed on the guacamole and chips today.  I am most definitely looking forward to a return trip!!!",

    "text": "TL:DR = Eat here.  Just do it.  It's The Best.  And now a little something for all you story people:  I'm not normally a Mexican food person.  I mean, I'll eat it, sure.  But when my girlfriend says, \"What do you want to eat,\" anything Latin is usually farther down on the list.  That said, I love a good taco, and I'm glad that my native Minnesota is rife with taco trucks.  So during a trip to Phoenix to celebrate my brother's graduation from ASU's PhD program we decided to find a good place for dinner, and he suggested Otro, having previously been a fan of Gallo Blanco (same dude and all).  You'd probably miss the place if you weren't looking for it.  The outside is pretty non-descript, but like all great things in life, appearances are most definitely deceiving.  The inside is gorgeous.  Beautiful woodwork, cool, lived-in-looking tables and chairs, and incredibly bright and colourful artwork by some local artists.  It's trendy without looking like it's trying too hard.  Joseph was our server, and he was perfect.  Very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, but never to the point of being overbearing.  My brother couldn't make up his mind on which tacos to order, so Joseph gave him an extra one on the house just so he could try it out.  Very nice.    My brother and our folks ordered tacos (the fish was a big hit all around), and I ordered the naco torta, which was grilled, chopped ribeye steak, two fried eggs on the top (but cooked how you want), lettuce, ahi aioli, and guac on the bun.  Holy crap.  It's amazeballs.  The meat was perfectly marinated and cooked.  I'd planned to eat half and bring half home, but by the time we left I looked down and wondered where the rest of my sandwich had gone.  We didn't have room enough for dessert, but I have no doubt that it would have been as incredible as everything else we had.  So.  Eat at Otro.  I'd even wear a sandwich board for them if they wanted me to.  Now I guess I'll need to open one of these up in Minneapolis.",

Their food taste so fresh even their chips are made in house. The portions are just right and the price is even better. Their ensalada de la calle or house salad is my favorite with fresh crushed green olives and jamon serrano, yum!!! Their tacos are also great and my other favorite is their house version of Pho, which they call chicken soup. Everything is made fresh everyday and you can certainly taste the freshness.  Their service is also great! They have attentive servers and very efficient and friendly. The establishment owner and the sous chef sometimes come out to check on every table to make sure every patron is happy. Everyone leaves happy and satisfied.  The best time to go is on Wednesday when they have the live Flamenco entertainment. This group of flamenco performers are amazing from the flamenco guitarist to the singer, to the dancer. I highly recommend this place and worth the visit.",

    "text": "Otro is a fiery gem in the food desert that is Phoenix. Sure, you can find good food in PHX ... but rarely do you find a restaurant that does all of it RIGHT! You can taste the freshness + authenticity they infuse into every dish.   My favorite things ... Guacamole: prepared fresh to order + so good with their house-made chips + salsa. Tacos: they are all good, but my favorites are their fish + pork belly tacos. Chicken Soup: perfect for when you or a loved one are feeling blue. Paella Mexicana: Full of amazing flavor, great for sharing, and sooo good as leftovers (with an egg in the morning ... yum!)  Now I have to share this story about their breakfast ....   When my boyfriend and I go out for breakfast, he always gets eggs, bacon, hash browns + 1 pancake. When he ordered the Sampler Breakfast at Otro, I don't think I've ever seen him so satisfied. Eggs were perfectly done. The bacon was seriously the best bacon I've ever tasted - also cooked perfectly. The pancake - omg, slightly crisp on the outside and soft in the middle - served with probably the best maple syrup we've ever had. To get his hash brown fix, he ordered a side of fries ... and WOW. It baffles me that the best fries in PHX are served at a Mexican Restaurant! Ha!  Thank you Otro for always satisfying my taste buds + heart!  xo, Taylor",

I had the Al Pastor burrito and my brother had the Carne Asada. The Al Pastor was full of flavor and absolutely delicious. The Carne was cooked medium and incredible as well. Definitely check this spot out, you won't be disappointed.",

Drinks stood empty as did our molcajete of chips. Iced tea was replenished, finally, but without ice. However, like Beth, I will be back for the great food. Try the frijoles negro (black beans liberally dusted with cotija) and the paella mexicana, delicious with bits of chorizo, chicken, and surprisingly zucchini. Some of the rice grains along the inside of the cast iron serving plate were wonderfully crisp. Your creative and delicious cuisine should carry you far, Otro, but only so far if the service continues to lag behind.",

Also several local Az breweries were represented, and the bar looked pretty well stocked, with some interesting house cocktails.  We tried both desserts (pudding and tort) which just put the meal over the top.  My only complaint, the menu was kind of limited.",

We were blatantly ignored once and got up and left after 15 minutes of staring at the menu. We gave it another shot and actually made it to the ordering part; and the food really is phenomenal once you actually get someone to take your order and bring it to you. The horrible service explains why it is never busy when we've gone. Which is unfortunate because we love the food. If they ever bring this place all together into a 5 star worthy eatery they will have a money making gem there! Until then know it's hit or miss on the service. More miss than hit. And honestly for me that was their last chance to gain me as a regular. Sorry Otro.",

So I decided to bring my friend. He ordered the steak burrito and I had the elote callejero, and steak tacos. The flavors of the taco were great and I would definitely come back to have some more. My friend was very disappointed by the burrito since the beans overwhelmed the other flavors, including the steak. The restaurant is cute and has friendly staff, but compared to other Mexican places like La Santisima & Joyride, from our experience, it's just ok.",

The day I decide to bring my friend to try it out, she is left with a poor impression of the place. We walk in, restaurant is about half full, we see a couple of open tables on the patio so we request patio seating with the person that greeted us. They look outside and tell us it'll be 5 minutes for them to get something ready for us. Well within the 15 that we actually waited 3 other staff members asked if we had been helped, to them we replied that we were waiting for an outside table (that had been clear and open the whole time). Finally we are taken to our table. Our friendly server took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. She comes to take our order and we ask for some chips and salsa as well. Well the chips didn't come until our food arrived even though we stopped another staff member to check on our chip order. My friends coffee was served cold and the refill I asked for on my Arnold Palmer was never brought out. Even though the staff was friendly, they never once concerned themselves for our discontentment. I don't often come here but not sure I'll be back anytime soon sadly. My friend was less than pleased with her first experience here. My meal was delicious though!",

About a half hour later we had to get up to go find waitress to ask for our check. She came over and asked us what we ate and drank so she could make out a bill for us. She did not even offer an apology for taking so long. I only gave 3 stars because the food was good and might give them another try and hope the experience was just a waitress having a bad day.",

I can't be effusive enough about how attentive the staff was, and how gracious they were about our many requests.  It seemed like every time the server approached the table, he left with another order.  We had the ceviche, guacamole, chicken paella, steak tacos, coconut pudding, and key lime pie.  Everything was amazing.  The wine menu was a little light, but someone (I think she was the manager) told us that they'd had a meeting with a wine distributor earlier in the day and would be expanding the wine menu in the coming weeks.  If you like Gallo Blaco, you'll like the additions to the menu offered by Otro Cafe.  The space itself is crisp and clean, although not particularly large.  I foresee long waits as word gets about this place.",

To start,  they would not sit us because we only had 6, the other two gals were on their way. The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said \"come on! \" to which I responded that we weren't a bunch of cows being herd to our table. He didn't say anything.  Our server was alright,  her voice was a bit much on the ears, have you heard of voice fry? The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff. So maybe I'll go again,  to eat tacos because they are truly amazing but I am now even more sad that Gallo Blanco is gone. .. the charm,  atmosphere,  attentive service is clearly not at this but the Otro (other) restaurant.

It was very good, maybe some of the best I've had in the Valley, and it was only $5!  I tried their al pastor, carne asada, and shrimp tacos a la carte. The pastor tacos were fantastic, the carne asada good, and the shrimp were tasty but there was plenty of room to put a third shrimp in the taco instead of a stingy two.   My wife had a chorizo torta. I thought it was delicious and immediately wished I had ordered that instead. It sounded good, but I thought it would be in a huge piece of bread, and I didn't feel like filling up on bread. Instead it had a very thin, soft bun which allowed the chorizo, egg, and black beans to be the show.   Beware that the iced tea is very fruity, but that's not a big deal. We sat on the patio but our service was still superb. I'm pretty sure we arrived after happy hour ended, but our waitress still charged us happy hour prices. Not sure what the happy hour was, but it lowered our bill by $7, and she ended up with a bigger tip of course as a result.   My only major draw back is I thought the menu was pretty limited. I think they had more drink options than food options. I'd like to see them expand the menu some, because the food was really good, and I'd like to try more. We will definitely be back.",

We preferred its former sister restaurant - Gallo Blanco - as it always had better food and service, but Otro is in our neighborhood.  We had hoped the closing of Gallo Blanco would bring its higher standards to Otro, but the exact opposite has occurred.  The food at Otro used to be good and now has taken a step down in quality and consistency.  The service at Otro has always been mediocre, but has become awful; always inattentive and often bordering on rude.  We are taking Otro out of our regular restaurant rotation for now - but hope we hear from others that it has turned the corner and is worthy of another try.",

    "text": "Did you ever have a little insignificant almost not worthy mentioning kind of thing happen while dining being a precursor to things to come?  It started with my iced tea. It was an unexpected fruity flavor but what really annoyed me was the very old orange slice hanging on my glass. I could tell by looking at it that it's been around for at least more than a day. That sort became a kiss death in my opinion and maybe blemished my experience a little bit.   They started us off with a generous amount of chips and salsas. The chips were fresh and slightly on the thick side. The salsas were both unique one was a very limey tomatillo and the other was a creamy very spicy red that had a smokiness to it with a slightly bitter taste to it.  I had the smaller sized Quinoa salad that was mostly quinoa. I thought the salad was OK. I liked the pumpkin and local yulu seeds in it. I also thought the sweet roasted corn in it was a nice touch and it would have been better with just a little more roasted corn.  I would have enjoyed the salad more if I didn't add the chicken because I didn't care for the taste of the chicken. I\"M NOT SAYING IT WAS BAD in any way but it had that similar taste to it that the hot sauce had that I didn't care for. It was something smokey and the salad flavors, the fruity iced tea and the smokey chicken just didn't taste good together for me. But I note that's just me and anybody else might like it.  My husband had what they called Paella. He said it was OK as a chicken with salsa and rice in a skillet kind of meal. It didn't have the crust of rice one expects at the bottom to be paella and the rice was mushy but OK. It seemed like more salsa than broth. He didn't recognize anything pork in the dish but was told it was in there when he asked about it.  I just kept looking at that falling apart soggy orange slice...........  2.5 stars  I do note they have a nice patio for al fresco dining.",

After I got home I realized half of my order was missing. I was pretty unhappy but I didn't I want to leave again because it was pouring outside.  The owner called and offered to drive our order up right away.  That is probably some of the best customer service I've seen in a long time. And just because of that I will definitely be going back to enjoy their food.",

    "text": "Came here with friends for a Saturday lunch. I ordered one chicken and one shrimp taco, and we ordered guacamole for the table to share. The guacamole was some of the best I ever had, and the chips were really good by themselves. They looked freshly made. Both my tacos were also good, clearly made with fresh ingredients. The shrimp itself was probably the freshest-tasting I have ever had. I really liked the hot sauces on the tables, especially the green, more spicy, one.  The atmosphere was very nice. There was some very interesting artwork inside. There were a decent amount of people there when we were, but it did not feel cramped. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  A very good choice for Mexican in Phoenix!",

The veggie taco with butternut squash, AMAZING. Pear mojito was good but it definitely took 15min to make it to me. FREE chips and salsa, so i still tipped accordingly, but the service was just bad. I came in after a day of moving so I looked a little scruffy but I watched our server go out of her way to basically cater to everyone but us. Its a small location so I dont know how she missed the dirty empty dishes (with my card on the edge of the table) for AT LEAST 10min.... if it wasnt for the amazing food I wouldnt go back.  But seriously, AWESOME food! UPDATE:  Ive been in a little more than a handful of times now and the ONLY time I have received good service is with Randy. He was absolutely wonderful.",

    "text": "Let me just say from the beginning that my husband and I are HUGE Gallo Blanco fans. Huge. So expectations for sister restaurant Otro Cafe were high going in. And let me tell you, Otro delivered.  After looking forward to Otro's opening for a while, we were finally able to make it in today for a late, lazy Saturday lunch. Our server was incredibly nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I decided to try the pear mojito just because, and it was delicious. Not to sweet, and (thankfully) not too strong. Just a refreshing start to what would turn out to be a wonderful lunch.  Chips and salsa are free, which is a nice change from Gallo, who does charge a small amount. We got the guacamole for a few bucks extra, and the chips, salsa, and guac were just like Gallo's. I think Gallo has the best guac anywhere in Phoenix--fresh ingredients, just a hint of citrus, and heat--so I was thrilled that Otro appears to serve the same recipe.  On to the main course: I usually get tacos at Gallo, but today I was in the mood for something different, so I went with the Inca Salad. Three words: to die for. Quinoa, corn, dried cranberries, and a bunch of other fresh ingredients, including what I believe are Yulu seeds, which add a great nutty flavor and occasional crunch. Delicious. A great choice for a light lunch, and very good on a day like today when it was already 90 degrees by lunchtime.  My husband had the paella and loved it. He described it as good old fashioned comfort food. I didn't try it because I am vegetarian and there was meat in it, but the husband was definitely a fan. From where I was sitting across the table I could tell it smelled delicious.  We were pretty full after all this food, but not overly stuffed, so we opted for the coconut pudding for dessert. Our server described it as cool, creamy, and not too sweet or overly coconutty, and he was right on. A very simple, very classic dessert that doesn't try to do too much. A cup garnished with chocolate shavings was the perfect ending to a very delightful lunch.  The word that kept coming to mind during the entire meal was FRESH. You can tell that Otro, just like Gallo, uses only the freshest ingredients, and that makes all the difference.  It sounds like they are going to be expanding the menu in the coming months, so you will definitely want to check this place out. Another great neighborhood dining spot. We will definitely be back.",

However, they always seem overwhelmed and understaffed.  The staff does a good job of greeting you once you arrive but that does nothing for your hunger pains.  The bartender(male) appears very dismissive and doesn't embody the welcomed face or culture you would expect.  I'm sure this is caused by a lack of team atmosphere and basic customer service skills or he could just hate life ...     With all that being said the food is amazing but the service makes you want to find another amazing place.  Empty or full confusion exist.  Come hungry and patient.",

I had the Caldo de Pollo con Fideo Chino & an Otro salad (Gotta keep it light to maintain my Size 4 figure!!!) --- simply delish. I had samples of the Mole Negro -- YUMMILICIOUS! The Paella Mexicana wasn't a fave but it's something I would never order for myself. Overall, I loved the food and definitely look forward to sharing more times with good friends here at Otro Cafe.

My daughter ordered a combo enchilada plate. After one bite - she found a hair. (Ugh) The kitchen apologized and quickly remade her order. My Asado chicken salad was fresh and flavorful - but not much for the $10 price tag. We left at $36. No one stopped by to check on us after we finished or offered anything after the hair incident. Didn't expect anything free-just more concern about our experience.",

Asked for \"second choices\" in case they didn't have them.  When the drinks arrived we needed a few more minutes to make our dinner selection.  Questions about the menu were apparently not appreciated by the waiter and answered very shortly.  We attempted to get the waiter back to take our order to no avail.  Finally we asked the hostess if she would get the waiter and another one came to take our order for additional beverages and food.  It took forever to even be served the second drink.  We noticed that a gentleman (owner?) was at the cooking station getting chips out of a large bin, putting them into bowls to be served with his bare hands.  Our dinner was finally served (one the wrong order, perhaps because the waiter couldn't hear over the loud music) and we found it to be just okay.  The Paella had little flavor.  The hostess did offer to buy us a desert but after this \"dining\" experience took us several hours, we did not want to wait any longer.

There were about 11 tables open. When I approached the hostess, she explained to me that there would be a short wait of 5-10 minutes.  I asked why and she said that they are out of menus (there were togo menus sitting on the hostess station), and that they just seated the tables that were already sitting.  She explained that they were afraid that the kitchen would get too many orders at once so instead of seating me at one of the many open tables at 11:30, she wanted me to wait 5-10 minutes.  Normally, I would not mind waiting when there is no place to sit.  But, this place just opened for lunch.  Why in the world would there not be enough people to cook food at lunch with 11 open tables?  I went back and forth with her and to her credit, she was very nice but I still could not get past the idea that I am being asked to wait while there are 11 open tables because the lunchers are wanting to eat.  Why are there not enough cooks for this place?  Was lunch a surprise today?  When you ask people to wait to be seated at a half empty restaurant because you don't want to put too much stress on the cooks to cook the food, you are asking us to take part in managing your staff.  I want to come to your restaurant to eat.  I don't want to have to call ahead first and find out if there are enough cooks for the number of seats you have.  I don't get paid to run that place. That's way more time than I have to put into eating during the business day.  Was the food good?  It was great.  Was the service from the waitress good?  It was fantastic.  Am I coming back?  Not at all.",

    "text": "We had been wanting to eat here for a while and finally made it happen.  Apps- We ordered the queso dip and before you imagine that bowl of yellow-ish melted cheese, think again. They mastered the art of melting cheese in a little skillet and mixed in is your choice of veggies or chorizo. We opted for veggies and it was great. Veggies tasted very fresh and the cheese was melted enough to use with a chip but not an actual liquid.  Entrees- I ordered two tacos. Carne asada and Al Pastor. The carne asada was the better of the two. Great flavor, moist, cut up well.. summed up as a tasty carne asada taco. The Al Pastor was great aside from the pork being a little dry. The sweetness from the pineapple was refreshing and salsa on top was a great savory touch. The wife ordered the chicken enchiladas and she really liked them. She got them with red sauce and it wasn't the \"normal\" runny red sauce that you get. This was an actual salsa that they use and it's not the same one as they bring with chips/salsa.   Oh! The tortillas are wonderful! I don't think this is a place that I'll crave often but it's definitely recommended to go and visit if you haven't yet.",

The food was good....no great....the BLT & A torta with hard fried eggs on it is still my favorite sandwich in town.   Minor complaints added up as the meal progressed....we were never served chips & salsa....my friend's Bloody Mary seemed to take a long time to get to the table....the music was very loud to almost being too loud to talk in a normal volume....the hostess seemed determined to stick us in a table next to the kitchen door and area where the wait staff get tea, silverware, etc and definitely seemed unhappy when I asked if we could sit by one of the open window booths.  Our server was okay but my experience at Otro has always been where the servers seem happy to see you, are chatty without being too chatty, and just extremely positive. Our server was nice but that Otro \"extra\" wasn't there.  All minor issues I know, but all were glaring in the face of the past wonderful experiences I've had at Otro. It has been one of my \"go to\" places to take visitors or just when I want a great overall experience because Otro seemed to have that something extra besides great food that kept me coming back and always recommending it to people.  I hope my experience tonight was not the new norm for Otro. I hope that \"extra\" isn't gone.  For food....5 out of 5 stars. For the rest of the experience... 2 out of 5 stars.",

I'm an Arizona near native and familiar with Mexican food, but recently, they don't know how to control the heat in their various dishes, to the point of it being inedible or making one wish they hadn't eaten it. I was told the chiles were hotter this year, but then you adjust! I had a shrimp cocktail that was too spicy to eat! The last guacamole was so hot, my son needed milk; I dealt with it. The point being, it's gone from flavorful to bad. Not eating there for awhile. This was a MAJOR disappointment.  Sorry Otro :(",

    "text": "I have pretty fond memories of Gallo Blanco, a modern Mexican food concept restaurant that adorned the trendy Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix for many years.  It was a fun eclectic take on the usual Mexican fare, but affordable enough to attract a diehard loyal following.  I'd gone there a number of times for dinner and happy hour with groups of all different kinds.  So it was obviously quite a shock to find out the Clarendon effectively gave Gallo Blanco the boot despite the restaurant's runaway success.  Otro Cafe was basically Gallo Blanco's 2nd location serving many of the same items in a similarly modern restaurant setup over on 7th Street just north of Bethany Home.  Now, Otro is chef Doug Robson's one and only.  I'd actually never ventured here before but my date loves this place.  So a little Tuesday night dinner get together it was.  The one thing my date loves more than anything else about Otro is their guacamole.  I don't remember Gallo Blanco's guacamole being that distinctive, but I will admit Otro's was quite delicious.  I'm not ready to say it was better than Barrio Cafe's guacamole, but as traditional guacamoles go Otro's can more than hold its own.  I think it's the Cotija cheese that really sets it apart.    For our main dishes, she went with a pair of Carne Asada tacos while I ventured into the unknown with a Paella Mexicana.  Paellas are more of a Spanish concoction than a Mexican one, but I've had really good paellas at Tapas Papa Frita in Scottsdale as well as a couple of places in Las Vegas so I was curious to see how this one stacked up.  Otro's version includes chicken, pork, chorizo, rice, and a garden of different veggies all mixed in.  It's also served with tortillas on the side if you want to make soft tacos out of it.  The paella came out very hot (scalding hot even), though not too spicy.  The flavor profile was quite impressive though I have to admit this paella was mostly rice and veggies moreso than the meats.  The portion size is more than big enough to feed two and I get that paellas are almost always dominated by the rice, but I guess I would've liked the meat and veggie proportions to be a little more equal.  My date gave me a sample of her Carne Asada taco and it was excellent.  She especially loves dousing her tacos with (what I believe was) the green tomatillo and lime sauce mix that they provide at the table.  You could pretty much put that sauce on anything.  Its that good.  No dessert this time as we were more than satisfied with the food we had.  The place was busy pretty much throughout the dinner hour (despite being a Tuesday in the middle of summer).  Our server was fast and friendly and environment was nice and relaxed.  Based on first impressions I would say Otro doesn't have quite the charm of Gallo Blanco, though the overall setup and menu are fairly similar.  There's no shortage of Mexican food choices (even in CenPho), but Otro has certainly earned its place as a neighborhood joint.  Otro has plenty of unique and unusual dishes to choose from, but I'd recommend sticking with Otro's traditional Mexican fare.  That's what Otro does best.",

When you walk in, the restaurant is visibly appealing, clean, with a industrial chic Mexican ambience. Once we were seated, we waited several minutes for a server, and then once we did we waited even longer for drinks with our chips and Guacemole (their guacamole by the way is the only reason they are receiving two stars). We eventually got our drinks (had to ask for water), ordered our food, and then waited longer, again for the food to arrive. Once it did, we were once again, unimpressed. My fish torta was rather bland, very little flavor aside for a bit of spice. My mother received eggs with a yolk that more closely resembled scrambled eggs than over medium eggs, and when she sent them back they took her whole plate to remake it, leaving her without food for several minutes. The rest of the food was passable, nothing wrong with it but nothing to praise. We received no discount for our trouble, and our service was overall slow despite them not being busy. As a Culinary student who will be studying Hospitality, and someone that works in a restaurant, I can say that this experience was unacceptable and that this restaurant would be a very poor choice to try. We will never be back.",

The ambience was really nice. There is bar, indoor, and outdoor seating available. There are giant sliding doors (with screens to keep the bugs out) on one side of the indoor seating area which gives the fresh air feel. It's a unique restaurant in an area with multiple dinning experiences.",

After several visits to Otro's 7th Street location over a several year period they have never disappointed. One of the best things is that you can get breakfast anytime! But peruse over their menu and I guarantee EVERYTHING is good. It's a hard choice if you've never been there. Want a delicious breakfast? Try the Nortico or El Madrid, and of course the flap jacks (recommended) are also a breakfast must have! Need a tasty finger food bite? Try any taco or burrito in any combo...YUM! Just want a veggie option or lite faire? Share an appetizer or a salad (and maybe Papas Fritas too....) to satisfy your nibble quotient. I can't  wait to go back again when I'm in the neighborhood.",

Ordered a couple of cocktails - was surprised they had a somewhat limited liquor selection, but all good, we made it work.    Started with the wood-grilled corn on the cob (Elote Callejero) which was pretty amazing.  Expensive for what it is, but considering taste alone, it was fantastic.  Ordered and shared the Paella, which was nothing short of amazing.  Lots of tasty goodies in there and the warm tortillas were amazing.    Server (Savannah) was really nice and friendly, but was stretched a bit thin that night (hard to get her attention when we needed something).  Would go back for the good smells and tasty food, for sure.",

No one in our party had mentioned the birthday to him, but he is so observant that he noticed a greeting card envelope sitting next to the honoree. Without saying a word beforehand, he presented a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal, careful to ask before setting it down, \"Is it your birthday?\"  I'm not sure which dessert it was (it may have been the tarta de limon), but it was absolutely delicious and perfect for sharing. Kenneth even came prepared with four spoons as he delivered the dessert, so we didn't even have to ask! Just amazing customer service. It is greatly appreciated!",

Beers and margaritas took 15 min to come out from time ordered. Inattentive service by our befuddled waiter, who seemed like he might have had a few joints prior to work. Food (tacos and salad) took 25+ min to arrive from time ordered. As a table we all felt abandoned.   We had invited another couple to join us last night and had been talking up Otro for weeks one of our delicious favorites. The food was fine but frankly maybe a few notches below our many prior visits.   Bottom line: something seems to be \"off\" at Otro. Someone's not paying attention to the operation. This wasn't just a bad night. We never saw a manager *ever* (at past Otro visits last year, we always had an enthusiastic manager come over to say hello and check on things).   Some people might give Otro the benefit of the doubt - maybe they were just having a rough night. But my guess is that there are big management issues that are spinning at this once great spot. Besides the mesquite wood, something else smells at this place and we will likely not be back, as it's apparent Otro is on decline now. It's a shame.",

I don't think there was a drop of seasoning on the shrimp. The salsa was also not very good. My mom ordered the Posole, and that really did it for us. It was also flavorless, and we were convinced there was freeze dried chicken, and not pork in the bland bowl of broth. My son didn't care for his quesadilla either, as he took two bites. I wanted to like this place, as I love the atmosphere, but I just could not get there.",

    "text": "Normally my family and I come here for breakfast on Sunday on the food and service are great. Tonight we came for dinner and couldn't be more disappointed. There were four of us and we had to wait...\"to clean off a table\" we were told. 15 mins later in a virtually empty restaurant we were seated.  Waiter took our drink and appetizer order. Food can put first? How? They had two bartenders on staff and the place is not busy. Waiter has no idea about food service. We completely finished both appetizers before the waiter finally showed up with our three drinks.  After I downed mine pretty quickly he came by to tell us our Pollo asado order would be delayed yet another 20 minutes. Put that on top of 20 we waited BEFORE he told us this. WTF??  Oh, and he never asked if I wanted another drink. Hey pal...Waiter 101 - Restaurants make a whole lot more on drinks than they do food.  While I would have recommended this place for breakfast I must warn evening diners to drop this place from the list of possibles. You will be sorry. Apparently everyone on the night shift for a Sunday is pretty damn incompetent.   Ok, so I was contacted by the \"new\" manager who admitted they have some staffing issues to resolve. He did the customary request for us to return soon but I asked him to contact me when issues were resolved and we'd be happy to return. To date, I haven't heard a word. So, on faith, we showed up again on Sunday at about 12:15pm. Told it's a 20 minute wait. Cannot use bar high top because \"the kitchen is behind\" per the hostess. I see things have not changed after months. Let's see how the service is. More to follow.",

Seemed fine because service was speedy once sat.   let's start w/the positives; Ron y pina as a cocktail....so tasty fresh pineapple, rum, lime and chili y salted rim which I love and you can also taste a light pineapple pulp.  For dinner I ordered the rice which was super interesting & had bits of veggies like mushrooms mmmmm. I bet it's their paella rice, it's a lil crispy and chewy and has some nice flavoring. I really could jus come and eat a million bowls of rice.   taco chinos are pretty bomb, so hearty and unique. They have this Vietnamese style thing going on. I know this is jus wrong to say but I would use less meat and add maybe carrots or a little bean sprt to give it an ump. But really that is minor.   my hang ups; I tried to order pork belly tacos but they were out and no chips and salsa which for me is blasphemy.  cochitia taco. was totally thrown off by the flour taco and I feel some sort of way for paying $4 for 1 taco, it was good but not impactful.  overall I wanted to love this place but I luv the taco truck la frontera more##%#^*+==",

We did have a couple changes to the orders and was hit/miss.  The hit - thanks for the meat change for the filling on the enchiladas, Miss - I did ask for no bean (which was done correctly), but I never got my rice and since we got appetizers it didn't become obvious right away as we had plenty of food.  The table behind us wanted to order lamb but they apparently had already run out around 630 on a Saturday?  Also, I did want the Lemon/Spanish cinnamon creme brule after our good meal and sadly - they were out on this as well (around 7pm on a Saturday), even with a few misses and some of the items seem to be slightly over-priced or priced maybe a bit higher than you'd think ... but we'll certainly be back and hope to try the patio in cooler weather!",

We once waited 20 minutes for a table that was empty when we got there. The service was laughably bad.

Lets start with first impressions when we walked in, the restaurant was so cute not to mention a restaurant with an open kitchen is a great start. We had the option to sit on the patio, which we took giving the weather was stunning. A young lady approached us saying she wasn't our waitress but wanted to make sure we had water while we waited and proceeded to ask if we wanted they to move a umbrella over or move us in a shadier area since the sun was on us. Fabulous! Our waiter came up and asked if we've been there before and proceeded to welcome us and give us a great recommendation of the guacamole, it was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Both of us being foodies, we ordered several different taco options, a burrito and their pozole blanco. Their complimentary chips and two different types of salsa did not disappoint and neither did any of our main orders. The menu is very Americanized but so worth is. Great establishment and well mannered friendly staff... ya, we'll be back... probably tomorrow!",

The most concerning part was the mass number of cars being towed from the parking lot.  Apparently the owner has spotters that report patrons using this parking for Camp Social and Joe's Midnight Run.  We were paranoid thinking our cars were going to be towed at any moment- we rushed through our dinner so we could get out in time.  We'll go back again, just not any time soon.",

    "text": "What a great addition to the neighborhood!  I came on a lazy Saturday afternoon with a friend. I really liked the layout of the restaurant. It's pretty open with a good sized patio. The restaurant was pretty empty on my visit, but it was also a Saturday in July and 112 degrees outside... not exactly the time of day most people in Phoenix are out and about.  We were quickly greeted, sat, and had our drink orders taken. I order a glass of sangria and it was the perfect light and refreshing drink for a hot summer day. And since it was happy hour, it was only $5.  To start, we split the Otro salad which has a little bit of everything, including eggs and corn nuts. I was a little wary, but since the waiter recommended it, we went with it. Excellent choice! The salad was light and flavorful, but also filing. The corn nuts added the perfect crunch and saltiness. We also ordered some guacamole to share. The guacamole was delicious and tasted really fresh. I'm pretty sure they make it to order because we asked for some changes and they were able to accommodate.  Being a big fan of Gallo Blanco, I had to try the tacos. I'm happy to report their just as good as Gallo's! And like Gallo Blano, they are also on happy hour daily from 2-6 pm. The other entrees, as well as brunch, also sounded great. The menu definitely has a lot more variety than Gallo.  If I was still living down the street, I would have made this place part of my regular rotation. Our server was great, the food was amazing, and you can't be their happy hour!",

I went in search of a good taco al pastor, and while theirs missed the mark of a truly authentic one, the taste and flavor of the taco here was very good.  (BTW I'm still in search of a taco al pastor that tastes as good as the ones I came to love in central Mexico so if anyone knows of a good taco shop send me a message)  Now on to what is really good...the Inca salad, I could eat buckets of it.  The sofrito rice is another of my favorites, perfectly cooked and perfectly spiced.  Elote Callejero - roasted corn with cheese and paprika...in a word YUM!!!  I can't wait to return and try more.",

The star of the dinner were the carne asada tacos!  I would go back just for those!  The bartender also made me a pineapple mojito that wasn't on the menu.  Great dinner spot!",

    "text": "Ohhh wow. Delicious.  My husband and I love Gallo Blanco, so we had to try Otro Cafe. The location is interesting; the restaurant is open and spacey, which I think I prefer to Gallo, and the seating is more comfortable. I really like that the kitchen is open and you can watch the chefs cook your food. I also think the staff is a little friendlier than at Gallo.  You're served the same two sauces as at Gallo, but you get chips. I also had a one person serving of guacamole, which was so good. Definitely some of the best guacamole I've had. I love that you can order a smaller portion, as my husband doesn't care for guacamole and if it's just the two of us eating Mexican, we don't get guacamole as an appetizer because it ends up being too big a portion. This ended up being perfect.  I had a veggie taco (kale, cauliflower, and squash) and a shrimp taco. My husband had the naco torta. The veggie taco was fantastic - I loved the mix of vegetables and the sauce they used. The shrimp was also excellent, with a really great slaw on top. The naco torta was huge and delicious - perfectly cooked over medium eggs and tender beef. It was rich and delicious.  We didn't intend on getting dessert but we decided to try the coconut pudding. I thought the consistency was a little thin, but it was creamy, smooth, and not too sweet. It was topped with some shaved chocolate which simply added to the richness. A great ending to a great meal.  Loved it! Can't wait to go back and try the other menu items.",

While I am partial to Gallo Blanco with the citrus infused guac, this one was pretty tasty.  I'm a huge fan of the chicken soup! Chicken soup you ask? Yes! It comes in a bowl of noodles and broth accompanied by a great selection of fresh herbs (Mint, cilantro) and veggies (beans, jalapenos) to spice your dish to your liking. All for $5? Its a steal!  Tacos: I am a huge fan of Gallo Blanco's tacos. My one complaint, is that there aren't enough on this menu. I know.... I know... They wanted to do something MORE than what they could do at Gallo Blanco. But I just love the GB tacos.  Paella- I've been eyeing it. Will be trying in short order!",

We also tried ordering a pitcher of margaritas that are very clearly listed on the menu.. but the server didn't know if they were available yet since it was a \"new thing they were trying\". They ended up being able to make us a pitcher, but instead of leaving it on the table for us to distribute as we like.. they insisted on pouring it evenly into everyone's glasses until none was left. Really annoying because we didn't all want to drink the same amount, especially those who were driving! The music was too loud and the service was too slow.

When you have great ingredients you have a shot at good food and when you marry that with this chef's touch you have success. They have similar dishes to Gallo Blanco but I appreciate the blend and uniqueness of plates like the Espanol that change things up enough to make this another stop in my Mexican stops.

    "text": "Have been here several times. I wish there was a location in little arcadia (hint hint). The jamon serrano served over bread with a balsamic dressing and avocado is a must try and we also like the shrimp ceviche, paella, sangria, key lime tart, Lux french press coffee. The mexican pop artwork is fabulous I would love to have one for my place. I also noticed a caja china putside so they must roast a whole pig sometimes. great service/ambience/very reasonable $$/incredibly fresh food/creative recipies",

    "text": "First exposure was great. Second exposure made me sick. Probably won't be back for a third. Still scores higher than Otro's sister, Gallo Blanco, simply because there aren't any hipster waiters talking trash about customers behind the bar like what you get at Gallo. Haha. Service here is truly decent and the staff isn't sitting around acting like they're gracing you with their presence. Great service. Food made me sick for awhile. I won't be back, but the staff alone earns three stars by itself!",
