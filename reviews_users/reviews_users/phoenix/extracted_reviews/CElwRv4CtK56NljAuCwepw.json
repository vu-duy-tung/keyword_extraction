The deals are awesome, great spaghetti and  meatballs. They also have some of the best original pasta dishes around and for affordable prices too.

The prices were decent around $10-$15 for most meals. We ordered a bottle of wine which was brought in a marble container that kept it cold throughout our meal. I ordered the chicken vegetable alfredo and my husband got the chicken parmesan. Mine was pretty good. They know how to make a good alfredo that doesn't separate.It could have had a bit more parmcheese to it or more flavor. The chicken really had no flavor and I thought would have been grilled. The vegetables were good except the shredded carrots on top were hard and dry. They softened up a bit once I stired them in the hot pasta. My husband's food was wonderful and I wish I ordered that after I had a couple bites. The marinara was great and the crispy chicken was tastey. There was plenty of food that I took half of mine home. Our waiter was fabulous and we will defiantly be back again when we want an Italian meal for a great prices.",

The menu was huge...so many great selections to choose from.  The food was great!  I tried the chalkboard menu of grilled chicken topped with tomatoes and feta with grilled veggies on the side and a side salad to start.  I ate every last thing on my plate...it was that good!

I ordered the portobello mushroom dish with a side of Caesar salad.   1) it can well be a personal preference but I'd like the gills off the mushroom. It just looked unappetizing.   2) the salad, which was supposed to be vegetarian, came with some special protein: a fly.  It was wet and looked mixed in with the salad so it probably came from the kitchen and somehow got trapped in the food prepping process.   Not gonna go into what happened after I found the fly, but I think that's enough reason for me to never come back again.",

Our waitress was Andrea and she was wonderful!  She greeted us right as we sat down and took our drink / food orders shortly thereafter. The spaghetti was good as always!  The atmosphere at this location is a little more contemporary than the one in Cave Creek and is about half the size, but they both have a very welcoming feel to them and all of the staff members are friendly.

The resturant was pretty empty for a Sunday evening. We waited over 40 minutes for our food after placing order. About  20 minutes into our wait we were told our order got made incorrectly and it would be out quickly. This was not the case. My son's food came out 15 minutes prior to ours. He had the Alfred Penne, had no flavor at all what so ever. I ordered the Pasta Puglia, which looked more like a bowl of zoodle soup.  As for service the waitress never came by to check on us before after order was placed, or after food arrived. I asked for napkins and never recieved any. I noticed other group of people arrive after we did and had their food out before us. The quality of service and food left a lot to be desired. My suggestions order to go.",

    "text": "Reserved table for a birthday party of 10. Pros:   1.  Table was ready when we arrived and they offered to seat us as we arrived instead of making us wait until everyone had arrived. 2.  They brought a complimentary birthday dessert big enough for the whole table to share, with doughnut holes on the bottom, topped with ice cream and whipped cream on top.  Questionable: The service.  Repeatedly, would ask the server for something.  He would leave, return to the table several minutes later with something else, leave again, and just when you started to wonder if he had forgotten what you'd asked for, he would return with it.  This happened 3 or 4 times, not just once.  On the up side, our drinks glasses were always filled.  Cons: I'm sorry, but it was the food!  I'd eaten here before and enjoyed it.  This time, not so much.  I did order a selection of bruschettas for the table, and those were good, for the most part.  But my main course, the \"Amy's Lasagna\" (billed as taking a little longer but worth it) and a strip along 1 side that was about an inch wide that was inedibly hard and in some places out-and-out burned that I had to cut away with a knife.  Also, what remained was incredibly salty (written by someone who probably uses more salt than I should).  If you're doing that to one of your highlighted dishes, I can't imagine what you're doing to the others.  Also, the guest of honor said his fettucchini alfredo main course tasted \"different.\"  If I were going to go back, I certainly wouldn't order either of those things, but at this juncture, I'm not sure I would go back.",

Lest you think it's but a shallow sampling of one dish, LOL, I have also tasted three different versions of their thin-crust pizza ordered by co-diners, and three or four of their appetizers. All simply delicious, w/o equivocation.   So, what do I get? The menu choices are just shy of the Cheesecake Factory. Nearly overwhelming, LOL. Turn to the very back, they call it the 'chalkboard menu'. You pick either a chicken breast, or a portabello cap. Then you pick from a selection of about six different methods of preparation, and you pick a salad which will accompany it. I get mine with a melange of roasted beets, cauliflower, broccoli, etc. I believe the salad is 'misto' (for mixed).  There is no pasta involved with any choice, here, which makes it easier on the belly. Plus, it allows me to splurge a bit on the 'breadsticks'. This is their pizza crust, with appropriate oil and spices for dipping.   Give them a shot!",

She took our order and when the waitress showed up she explains that \" I didn't know I was still on the floor.\"  Hmmmm we were in the middle of the restaurant. She later explain is was a BIG miscommunication that involved \"4 of us\".  They offered a free desert for the experience and the wait, which took us over 20 min to get that.   Meanwhile I went to use the restroom. I saw the girl that was our server was going into the stall next to me with a can.... Didn't think much of it. Ohhhhh I should have.   The handle too to the stall was all wet. The toilet seat was drenched! Both covered in Lysol. I walked out to wash my hands and the garbage was already bagged up. It's 8:40 and they close at 10pm and they're running around like they need to leave.  The manager has left for the night. Of course she has.... If I were in her spot I'd run of embarrassment too!

I do want to mention that she checked on the people behind us multiple times. My biggest issue was being sat at the smallest table and the waitress never came to pick up our dishes, so basically I sat at a table full of dirty dishes, trying to eat my entree!

My friend had a roasted veggie salad that she loved.  What's better?  They serve the BEST foccacia bread ever.  It is homemade and comes out warm.  If only I could have a glass of wine at lunch, it would even be more perfect.  How does this problem get solved?  Order some  bread to go and stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds before serving.  YUMMERS!!  I HAD to bring some home to my #1 to try and we froze it.  When we were ready for it, bring it out to room temperature and then nuke for 30 seconds.  Life is good with their bread and some wine.  It doesn't even need the EVOO and balsamic but pretty darn good as a nice little treat.  Okay, marinara sauce makes for some awesome dipping sauce as well.  Their parking lot is challenging during peak hours but well worth maneuvering.  You'll find the walk back to your car after a meal at Babbo a good idea so this, too, is good if you have to park across the lot.  Good service and only wished they would open a site in Las Vegas!",

When we tried samples the pasta was delicious! It was so good that my friend and I decided to eat here for lunch one day. When we went in the place it was half empty. We were surprised because of the reviews and it was a Saturday that the place would be empty. We got sat, we ordered our drinks, and looked at the menu. Our waiter was very nice and brought our drinks out quickly. We ordered our food once we got our drinks. I got the garlic chicken pasta and my friend got a garlic zucchini pasta. When our waiter brought out the bread with the dipping oil..we were disappointed because the the bread was still doughy and it was slimy and chewy. When we got our pasta we were disappointed as well the pasta was pretty much like soup. At one point my friend Said the sauce would make a better mushroom soup. I thought the same. It was very soupy. You would think it would be creamy?  I guess we came on a bad day or something because the reviews are great but sadly I can't say we have a great experience. I would have to say maybe we will try again but this being our first time was very disappointing.",

We were seated right away. They were not super busy. Once seated we waited for about 10 minutes before being greeted by our server. The server was very awkward. He said Hi, I guess I am your server tonight, as if we were expecting someone else. The waiter had no knowledge of the menu. We got our salads, which were amazing, we waited a while for them too and we got them before we got our drinks. I ordered a Red Wine and the server brought me a white wine. I knew if I said anything it would just be bad so I walked over to the bar and swapped it out. We got our pasta and it was amazing. I had to ask for fresh pepper, it was not offered and the girl did not ask anyone else at the table if they cared for any, which of course they did. The food was great, but it looked like a cheap chain with great food. No candles or flowers on the table. I felt like Gordon Ramsey would be popping in anytime. I cannot complain about the food, because it was great. It looks like they hire a bunch 16 year olds with no food industry training. Their employees' need training and it should help the dining experience. Ordering out would be the best plan for this place until they get their act together.",

They received a lot of money that night from all of us since no one caught it. They need to let you know that even if they split checks, any party of 6 or more will be automatically added tip.

It was my very first time eating here, I was really hungry and didn't know what was good on the menu. I decided to play it safe and order the \"Alfredo Supremo\" which was a white wine, garlic cream alfredo sauce over a bed of linguine with chicken. It was filled with flavor and was yummy to my tummy! The bread that's served as a complimentary appetizer was awesome as well. I really recommend eating at Babbo's if your in the mood for tasty pasta dishes!",

And, their foccicia bread that they served while waiting for our food was warm, soft and very tasty.   However, it feels too much like a semi-fast food chain - and the others at my table didn't enjoy what they ordered.  They complained that the pizza was weak.  I'd go back, just for that salad.",

We ordered the artichoke, shrimp and crab dip to start. It should just be called artichoke dip, as the shrimp and crab was very lacking...maybe 5 little bits in there.   I ordered a Mista side salad and it was soooo heavily loaded down with crap, sometimes less is more!   Now, the dinner was pretty tasty! I got the roasted Brussels sprout and pancetta pasta, heavenly!!! Though i wish they would have put MORE Brussels sprouts and less pancetta, but over all pretty decent.   We enjoyed it and will probably go back again.",

Last week, I finally broke down and came here - I ordered the flank steak salad. It was really good, although it was a bit heavy on gorgonzola (I can't believe I just typed that... there is NO such thing as too much stinky cheese!). I loved their focaccia and dipping oil, too. My only complaint was that the 'small' salad size was still too freaking big, and I wish I had tried the new roasted brussel sprout and beet salad. That one sounds really tasty... so, next time. :)",

There wasn't enough spaghetti and it was swimming in way too much, very acidic sauce.  The meatballs were good, though.  What really gets me, however, is upscale Scottsdale prices in what is really a neighborhood bistro.  In summary, way overpriced for not really great food.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to update my review for Babbo after a negative experience.  Seeing as how I don't make it up in that direction much, and I had to go up there today to run an errand, I was very excited about stopping at Babbo to pick up a salad for lunch.  I eagerly went to their website, picked out my perfect salad -- the Chicken Chopped Salad, which is new to their menu -- and placed my order.  I stopped by to pick up my salad, paid and came back to work.  To my dismay, once I opened up my salad, I noticed there were things in the salad that I didn't know came in the salad and that I don't eat -- like black olives and mushrooms.  Hmmm, I thought, did I make a mistake and order the wrong salad?  So I went back to their website only to learn that they actually gave me the WRONG salad!  Seriously????  I called the restaurant and the guy who helped me while I was there had already figured out his error and was apologetic for it.  He offered me a free salad the next time I come in, which is fine, even though I don't go there often.  However, considering he had my phone number from my online order, he could've at least tried to call me before I got all the way back to my office.  I had my mouth all ready for a good chopped salad and instead was given some crap I couldn't enjoy.  Although I was able to pick out most of the mushrooms, the salad I received was basically inedible for me, because there were so many black olives in it that it was hard to try to pick them all out.    I'm so disappointed.",

The service was prompt and attentive. I dine alone quite frequently. Often times, i experience a \"set it and forget it\" attitude from my servers. One they set my food down, they forget about me until its time to pay the bill. My server made sure i had refills, my food tasted good and just a general quality check before dropping off the bill. I had the stuffed manicotti with sausage, and it was great! I just wish they had oil and herbs for the bread, because I don't like balsamic vinegar, but that isn't a deal beaker. I will definitely be back to Babbo, with friends or alone.",

Only seconds after I was seated, I was given a huge plate of bread sticks. They were delicious, and I loved the balsamic and oil dipping sauce. I ordered a glass of Sangria. I was not that impressed with it. It tasted like it had been poured directly from a bottle of the cheap Sangria that you can buy at CVS. The Caesar's salad was okay, but as I ate it I found several pieces of wilted and brown lettuce.  I went to Babbo because I was craving spaghetti and meatballs. The meatbalsl were delicious, but the tomato sauce seemed very bland. The food was not bad, but it just wasn't anything spectacular. I will say that the portion of pasta and tomato sauce was huge. I had enough left over to make two full meals.   I would go back to Babbo, but I am more likely to go to other local Italian places like Spinato's or Oregano's instead.",

    "text": "So, it was Knife's first night on the town for 2016. Had a hankerin' (yes, I said hankerin') for some pasta and wasn't sure where to go. Had seen Babbo's next to the grocery store, but it didn't originally come to mind. Buca di Beppo and Carrabba's did...but no Babbo's. So after zooming past Carrabba's, I decided not to circle back and instead give Babbo's a try...and boy am I glad I did! Babbo's has quite a few locations in the valley and it is easy to see why. The place is YUMMO (yes, I said YUMMO)! I went on a Saturday at about 6:30pm and there was a wait for a table. No problem, since I was \"Fork\"less, Knife decided to sit at the bar. The bartender, although very busy, quickly greeted me and took my drink order. Warm and wonderful  focaccia bread, oil/balsamic quickly followed. I then placed my order of the Italian Sausage pasta dish and dove in to the bread. Very soon thereafter my entree arrived. It was great! The sauce was perfect. So many times in chain Italian places, you get a flavorless, \"meh\" type of Ragu . Not here! The sauce was flavorful and I mopped up what was left after my pasta with what was left of the focaccia (not much of either). The Italian sausage was spicy (as advertised in the menu) and the pasta cooked to perfection. Another thing I want to mention is that although I was clearly done with my entree (my dishes had been promptly removed), and the place was hopping, there was no push to move me along. Knife does not like being rushed when dining. So, although this place has paper napkins and serves water in plastic cups, this is pretty much \"fine\" and fun dining. Knife is one satisfied diner and will be coming back to Babbo again and again...you should too. - Knife (Be sure to check out the reviews of my culinary cohort, Fork...and follow all the reviews of KnifeNFork\"!)",

His reply was let me go wipe one down for you. So he did and that was great.  Once we were seated I noticed that more people coming in the door were given the same response when wanting a booth. Why wouldnt you just send someone to clean all the empty tables? I saw plenty of people working and the booth we sat at I could see an employee wrapping silverwear the whole time we were there. Then I noticed there was a lot of crumbs all over the floor in multiple spots. Kinda gross. Well I ordered the buffalo chicken Caesar salad. My fiance ordered some italian sausage mac and cheese. Plus a glass of wine. My salad came out and was not very large and the presentation was boring. Ive had better salads at fast food joints. The mac and cheese again was small and tasted really greasy. Our bill was 40 dollars. What a joke. I should have gone somewhere else for that kind of food. Not worth the money. Dirty, expensive and the food was not great at all.",

If you're not a large eater,  u could find yourself in a comparable situation. I ordered two Mon night specials w bread for an impromptu dinner w 2 other women. This being their first time having Babbos, I hit the ball out of the park! After gushing & complimenting my ability to always know the best spots...haha..we were stuffed & had never opened the 2nd container. Between the three of us we were more than satisfied from one meal. But no one complained about having the extra one bcuz it was such a hit we would've hated to not have leftovers! Kudos to you Babbos for not only having one of the hardest menus to choose from while dining in (everything screams choose me!). But you are the only restaurant I know that gives equal food, taste, service, portion size, and value on your carry out items. I stear clear of take out for this exact reason yet u've shown there are still places that deserve the benefi of doubt..Thank you for knowing if a night at Babbos doesn't fit our schedule, our family is blessed to still enjoy the same delicious meal at our dining table as they would if they were there.

First though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist.  Didn't speak Italian to me, so I figured would wait for the food.  Our first round of drinks was a little watered down, but didn't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of Italy.  When they brought the food, though it spoke wonderful Italian.  We had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start.  I am no fan of mushrooms, but these were great.  Buttery, not too chewy, and just right.  My ex and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portions were just right and the sauce was perfect, not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess.  Food was brought out fairly quickly.  I look forward to coming again, my only impression leaving was with the interior, it felt kind of like the Pei Wei of Italian, just lacking the red trademark Pei Wei lighting.  Maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark Babbo.",

My boyfriend had the super chopped Mediterranean salad which was just a bunch of kale chopped up very few Mediterranean ingredients. I had the stuffed portobello mushroom. The mushroom was very good but the sausage tasted like Sysco sausage and the marinara tasted like canned tomato sauce and was very runny. Jesse,however, was very attentive and we were impressed with his service.",

The spaghetti and meatball plates on special looked pretty good (my fiance and friend both ordered that).  I might come back to try one of the other salads, but would not order the kale/quinoa salad again.   Service was good. That is all!",

The bartender was right on it for us with water and a glass of wine (well-priced). I ordered a salad and the Chicken Parmesan Pasta. My partner ordered a pasta. Service was quick and attentive; food was promptly served. (And the bread is delicious.) Now, we understand why Babbo is always busy: good Italian food at good prices in a well-run restaurant.

For such an extensive menu, the quality of the meals was very good.  Complimentary warm focaccia bread with oil and balsamic was a wonderful start but we still ordered two apps:  Wild Mushrooms with Roasted Asparagus (9.95) - Wild Mushrooms, Marsala, Toasted Walnuts, Roasted Asparagus, Shaved Parmesan   Spicy Green Beans - Fire Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Sauteed Spicy Green Beans, Almonds, Shaved Parmesan  If I could only choose one app, I suggest the spicy green beans because there is more flavor and less oily. The spice tickled my tongue, there was no burn. Only flavor.  For entrees we enjoyed a regular order of Penne Marinara and   Pasta Primavera (11.95) - Mixed Peppers, Broccoli, Zucchini, Mushrooms, Diced and Sun Dried Tomatoes in a White Wine Garlic Butter Sauce. Served on Linguine.   There was ample sauce in both dishes and I mixed a bit with the other. Tasty!   After having the spicy appetizer I wanted some spicy in my primavera so I had to add some pepper. On the next visit I'm going to ask if the chef will make the dish spicy too.  Tiramisu for dessert. Not a fan. Won't order again.   .",

At first I thought it was an Italian \"fast\" restaurant similar to sauce (which I love by the way). Its actually more of a sit down and order restaurant. Their deco kind of throws you off a little bit. We got seated pretty fast for how busy it was.   They serve you focaccia bread with oil and vinegar as a starter. However I wasn't a huge fan of the focaccia (thank goodness I would have totally ate the entire thing!) we started with an appetizer the mozza-balls, which were delicious! I want to say they were most definitely stuffed with mozzarella and I think Parmesan, Sitting on top of their delicious meat sauce. I loved how they weren't super greasy they were really crunchy and fried to perfection!   I ordered the pasta primavera which was delicious! My husband and son ordered the macncheese and spaghetti I had a taste of both of course! And I was envious of their dishes lol.   Our server which I believe his name was Brandon (don't quote me) he was really nice, enthusiastic, and helpful. Very attentive as well. Their menu can get a little overwhelming for me at least. I'm such an indecisive person it ruins my life! Haha    All in all a great place for some yummy pasta. Next time I will try their pizza and cocktails. I was taking a look at their cocktail menu and a few drinks caught my eye and tastebuds! Definite must try if you're in the area. Order the mozza-balls please! You can thank me later.",

    "text": "This cute Italian Eatery just lost my business.  I'm a stickler for service and this place just totally turned me off.  Let me first say, I do enjoy the cuisine at Babbo and have enjoyed dining there frequently.  However, despite how many times you gone there you must be sure to get on their email list. Otherwise you aren't part of the \"Babbo Family\". Somehow I missed the opportunity and perhaps that was my oversight.  Getting to the point... I walk in with an email promotion forwarded to me by a friend offering $25 extra dollars free for every $25 in gift card you buy (up to $100 value). Great promo, I'm thinking...I eat here all the time so why not get one for myself or gift it to someone special.  The hostess asked for my print out but I didn't have it being that the details didn't specify it was required.  Then instead of asking if the email was sent directly to me from Babbo, she takes my phone trying to investigate herself.  Then asks if I'm part of the Babbo Family.  It was a very disrespectful way of making one feel excluded.  In short, the gift card promo needs to be improved if they plan to run again.  Perhaps including in the fine print that it's only valid for the email recipient, those on the Babbo email list (aka part of the prestigious email \"family\").  Also, if printing is necessary, then say so.  I'm in the field of project management inclusive of marketing and feel like this was a failure for a place I once adored. Too bad.",

    "text": "Trying out Babbo for the very first time and was hoping that the trip was not a waste.  I did check Yelp reviews prior to going but you know how it is--sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong.   We were served sliced foccacia bread along with a dipping sauce made from an olive oil/balsamic vinegar mix.  I felt too much balsamic for the olive oil, but gave it a whirl.  But first I added black pepper, hot pepper flakes and a little salt.  Not bad, but I hate having to \"cook\" when I go out to dinner.  The foccacia and dipping sauce was quite nice.  But, but, but.... why is it that they never give you small plates so you can put your own bread on it and you don't drip olive oil from the table to your mouth??  So I asked Morgan, our server, if they have bread plates.  She says, \"Sure\" AND THEN she comes back with ONE plate (there are two of us ! Morgan).   Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, \"MISTA\" or something like that.  Small salad but delicious.  Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS.  It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing.  Really good.  I stole some from hubby so I know.   Entrees arrive:  Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a \"chalkboard\" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies.  No pasta.  Pasta was $6 extra.  Really?On a $13 entree?  not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate! Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs.   BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why.   If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant.  If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well.  So here it is:  the italian meatball was really, really, really good.  A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness.  That's just me.  The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano.  Not here.  It was a good mix of spices.  And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own.  Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the \"capo di tutti capo\", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around!  Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, \"skip the mop... I'll lap it up\".   No, really, it's that good.  With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards.  It was pretty good.  Better than mine.? No.  But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander).   So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again.  Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion.  PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management:  The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate.  Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the sauteed veggies--He liked it all.  Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special??  Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty.  Even I do so at home.  There was no parsley garnish, nothing.  I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush.  Yes, mush.  That's the word I was looking for.  The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it.  Management could you work on making this dish look more professional?  My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce.  Nice.  So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars.  Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) .  We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate.  Head on out to Babbo's.  You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here on my birthday for dinner. I ordered the stuffed manicotti with no sausage (turkey is the only meat I eat). The waitress asked if I just wanted the peppers it in then and I said yes. When it came out there was meat in it and no peppers. The description of the meal in no way says there would be any other meat in it. The waitress checked and agreed, but said all their sauces have the boulenese sauce (with meat) though it states that nowhere. She said she would get a new one out in a few min. After my bf had been completely done with his meal for at least 10 min, I saw her stick her head out the door and say nope it's not out to someone and go back in. She actually came back to our table maybe 5 min or so after that and said it's still not ready and wondering what we wanted to do. I said to just cancel it, it's my bday and I was hungry and not happy at this point. She proceeded to bring the bill with a measly 20% discount on my bfs pasta and our 2 glasses of wine for \"the inconvenience\". No dessert, real apology, or anything. I didn't get to eat dinner on my bday! She also never refilled water, asked if we wanted more wine, or anything in the middle of this. Horrendous service.",

It was great with just olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and also on the chicken Caesar sandwich which I had without the buffalo sauce.

My only suggestion would be serving it on a larger plate, we each had trouble cutting and keeping the toppings on the plate. I got the Alfredo Supremo and my husband got the Stuffed Manicotti with sausage, both were out of this world. Please, please, please open a location near Tucson. This was easily the best Italian food we've had in a long time.",

Our appetizer was over cooked (raviolis), the margarita was watered down (sent that back) the chicken in our pasta was not tender. Just completely disappointed. The waitress couldn't even stand still to get our order and rushed away every single time. We will not be returning to this location. Only gave it a 2 Star for the one good appetizer we did get.",

    "text": "Went there with a client/friend the other evening.   It was rather noisy and busy and he thought we'd go somewhere else if we wanted to hold a conversation and actually hear each other.  After visiting the nearby Sprouts and doing a little shopping, he decided, nahhh.   Let's go to Babbo after all.  I was starving, so that was fine with me.   First I had to check out the bar menu.   What??  Tito's martini, $9??   I am so there!  Told the server how I wanted it:   shaken with ice, no vermouth, in a martini glass.   Perfecto!   As we perused the menu, we snacked on the warm bread (Yes, bread.  Remember?   I was starving!!) dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  We both ordered the Pomodoro Tomato.   I thought it was some kind of salad, like with lettuce, but I was informed, no, it was a tomato with mozzarella cheese, just like the menu says, with virgin oil, sea salt, and basil.  Huhhh?   He's Italian.   Therefore, he explained it to me.   Yummmmm!!   I wouldn't mind making that myself.   In fact, I think I shall for the next luncheon or dinner party I have.    I had the Great White Buffalo and he had the Babbo's Bowl O' Bolognese.   My pasta came with two big pieces of chicken.  Very creamy and tasty with the Gorgonzola Sauce.   It seemed rather paste like, as though there was maybe flour used.   I think it could have done away with that, albeit it was good.  Even though he professed not to be hungry, he did down his Bolognese and pronounced it to be very good.   I guess he was hungrier than he thought.  I would go back.   It is conveniently located.  The drink prices were perfect.   The service was friendly and accommodating.",

If you are truly a Italian lover, this place is sooo cute, and tasty! My favorite is by far the 'kids mac n cheese', the same thing as the 3 cheese adult plate, but without some spices and the meat, (I'm vegetarian).  I have been going to babbos since the location on 67th & 101 opened up a few years ago. My mom was a waitress there for a couple months, and always brought home the fresh bread.  Seriously amazing, and what makes it better is that it's was my current boyfriends favorite place to eat, even before we were together! Now our special date nights are always at Babbo's.   To the owner, (blonde lady?), YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. amazing food. thank you for this restaurant! i la la la looooove this place and all the locations.   *only downside is the location in N. phx near cave creek is kind of a dud. Either it needs a few aesthetic pick me ups, or the staff really doesn't enjoy their job. doesn't render my feelings of the business overall, but just a tip/note, the staff really seemed annoyed customers would keep coming in about an hour before close, it wasn't even busy at all, and they all seemed young and wanting to do something else. i was a waitress for a couple years and that vibe is never what you want your table to feel. we still tipped great, just didn't really love the vibe compared to all the lovely ones around phoenix!",

Mostly tables but they have a few large booths if you are lucky enough to get one.    We started out with the garlic hummus dip. It's very similar to regular hummus but with a blend of garlic and anchovies. Lots of garlic! Don't worry, it's not fishy at all and you can never have too much garlic right? Super good, but you probably won't be kissing anyone after eating it!   For my entree I had the Pasta Puglia (poo-lia). I have dinned at Babbo several times and I always seem to order it!  It's a combinations of Fresh Tomato Brodo, Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Sausage topped with Fresh Basil and Shaved Parmesan Cheese. Served on Fusilli pasta. The sausage in this is fantastic!   My mother ordered a salad and pizza lunch combination. She had the Caesar salad and a nice sized personal sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza. She loved it. I of course had to try a slice to confirm...I loved it too!  Check out Babbo! You won't be disappointed. They also run pretty good specials certain days of the week! Great happy hour too!   By the way, I was at a holiday party over the weekend catered by Babbo! Everything was delicious!   Enjoy!",

I will only review tonight's offerings... The lady ordered some formation of pasta in a cream base with bacon and mushrooms.  All of the bacon was of the soggy, flaccid variety amount to chewing soft fat.  I actually don't mind when that happens as I will just skip past it but it grossed the lady out.   I ordered the pasta puglia and the pasta was either ice cold or pretty hot.  Kinda reminded me of when I used to warm up leftover Olive Garden after a night of drinking in my college era.  I possibly would have sent it back but I noticed the 6 waitstaff busting out the sidework at 8:00pm. Oh yeah, they also ran out of bread?  What?  How the hell would you have made my sandwich if I would have ordered one since that is approximately half the menu.  I'm assuming they meant the bread that is designed to bring out the table and they do not have a competent enough chef/microwavist to modify the bread selection on the fly.  Personally, I will pass.  Feel free to give them a shot on $5.99 pasta night.  Makes you feel a lot better when you spend that than when you shell out 10x that amount on a few drinks, cold food, no bread, and soggy bacon.",

(I will say that my waiter was a champ).  when I walked into the place they were semi busy but I had made a reservation because it was for a group of 12.  I walked up to the hostess stand to check in which the hostess was there but yet didn't greet me for what felt like 10 minutes it was probably closer to 5.  We were seated shortly after checking in and the waiter did come over fairly quickly and was super nice.  The part that was not good was the FOOD, a lot of the bread that was brought out was burnt, a majority of the meals that were brought out were burnt and one friend of mine did not like hers so was going to order something else but the manager was very rude about it.  The manager said the kitchen was about to close so she needs to hurry up in a very rude manner.  The checks were messed up so they had to be redone.  Had to be reminded of the desert that was ordered but the kitchen was closed by that time so we couldn't get what we had then wanted.  Needless to say bad first impression unfortunately and definitely won't be going back!",

The menu is large, with plenty of pizzas and pastas to choose from.  From the pizza menu, it's hard to choose between the traditional choices like the Sicilian or meat-a-ball, and the more interesting varieties like the chicken alfredo with spaghetti baked on top of the pizza - but I think my favorite would have to be the barbecue chicken pizza.  On the pasta side of the menu, there are a couple dozen great dishes, but the new three-cheese mac and cheese with bacon and Italian sausage may just be the best thing on the menu.  Service has always been great.  Everyone is friendly, and there's a casual atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

I got a calzone with meatballs, bacon and extra cheese for $11 and it was HUGE and delicious - their mozzarella is very smoky and balanced with the two meats, it was perfect. It came with a side of marinara but was also good with the hummus spread.  Service was a little slow as the place got busier but that's to be expected. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I came here just after the weekday lunch rush on my lunch break. I am always looking for new places to try, especially Italian and this is not too far from work. I honestly thought it was a fast casual kind of place but it's a sit down restaurant. Service was slow; it took a long time for someone to come up to the host stand to seat me, yes I came alone. After being seated, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to take my drink order. I was told bread was on its way but I never got it. It looked really good though because every other table around me had bread. I went with the $9 lunch special, which is a salad and pasta (select menu). My Caesar salad was very good but was hoping to be offered fresh cracked pepper, which didn't happen. I waited about 15 minutes for my pasta after I finished the salad. Pasta portion was perfect for lunch. As a tip, if you want to add meat, you're looking at $4.25 for chicken, more for seafood. I just got the pasta without the meat. My waitress really wasn't attentive and had to ask another waitress for a drink refill. She did, however, get me a to-go drink. I don't know if she's new but she seemed very nervous and jittery.   Overall, I really enjoyed my food just not the service. I would probably come again but order it to go or even try another location.",

I decided to try it since we came on a Tuesday night and that was the special. I was pleasantly surprised! The meatballs were huge and seasoned perfectly.  Spaghetti and meatballs are $7 on Monday and Tuesday nights. The stuffed portobello mushroom is yummy. I husband always gets a pizza and is very satisfied. We have had excellent service every time and the atmosphere is very charming. Perfect for date nights on a budget.",

Every time I have been in there, whether its picking up a take out order or dining in, I have always experienced super friendly and attentive service.  Once I placed an order online, had the hubby go pick it up and he managed to come home with the wrong order!  I took it back, explained the situation - they were super apologetic, found our order, and refunded our bill to boot for our trouble.  That is stellar customer service in my book.",

The menu here is large.  The pizzas are yum.  The pastas are nice.  They have this italian sandwich which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the sandwiches had more side choices.  You get a bland pasta salad at lunch or fried zucchini chips at dinner which are nice when fresh, but if left too long before hitting the table they are cold and floppy.  I have found the salads to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn't impress I am hard pressed to come back.  The service here sways between attentive or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The prices are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains.",

You can't beat it.  The first time I planned to try it I though it was just pretty mediocre but was quite surprised.  The sauce is cooked just right and not raw tasting like one other chain Italian restaurant.  I think the last name of that one is \"Garden\".  It is a good source of Vitamin C. The pasta is just cooked right and their recipe for their meatballs is one of the best. So when I am feeling like I need a little extra Vitamin C I head right to Babbo. Other times also when I start craving some good Italian food. This is real East Coast Italian cooking which is hard to find in AZ. Not many SW restaurants know how to cook Italian.  Almost forgot the home made bread they serve there.  Crusty just like it is suppose to be. Try some of their Olive oil and balsamic mix for dipping.",

    "text": "The servers here at Babbo Italian Eatery wear a shirt that has \"Babbo, ten years and six locations\" on the back. After eating here, you will understand why they had to open more than one.   Babbo is a mostly family run business, that offers simple and very tasty Italian food. It is technically a chain, but management clearly pays attention to the details and the severs in-turn stay on top of things.   We found Babbo to be nice change. So many of the larger places seem to lose track of you, or they are over working their servers with too many tables. Not here.   We started with a Merlot and Strong Bow ($11.45).  After our trip to Ireland, I still have a taste for Bulmers. See photos. This was followed pretty quickly with two house salads ($7.99), which were crisp and tasty.   For our entrees, we order the Pasta Rustico for $10.95 and I tried their Italian version of Cajan Jambalaya. Both were tasty and very good, see photos. The heat on the Jambalaya was just right and it's Italian seasoning and sausages, was both interesting and tasty.   Btw, the portion sizes were enough for two take home bags. Nice!  Expect to pay $25 each, including drinks and taxes, but before gratuities.   Enjoy!",

We had a very kind waiter who went above and beyond. The place was packed, which is nothing short of a nod to both the chef and owner.

Well, in the end, they made it work and that says a lot about the management / employees at this location.    Service was awesome and they even set up a special menu for our large party, to make this entire process run a lot smoother. Food was outstanding, as well... shout out to the cooks.

She was so knowledgeable about all the pastas on the menu and helped me choose two dishes as I drove. I ordered one of their new pasta dishes Jenna suggested which was the pasta francaise and also a regular order of spaghetti. The pasta francaise was to die for and now one of my new favorite pasta dishes there! As I picked my order up Jenna greeted me and was so sweet and helpful. She got us our food and overall had such a great and happy moral. I used to work in the service industry and it was very refreshing to see someone so passionate about what they do. Not to mention she bent over backwards as she helped me choose what we should get. Babbos has a great team and I'll always continue to come back for their great pasta and even better staff!",

You still get the same level of trashy clientele as an Olive Garden but with better food and service. The happy hour is great. When the place is packed it feels really cramped and for some reason the tables seem small. Also if it's the spaghetti night, you seen a bunch of depressing bachelors eating alone by the small windows by the window. Maybe they should make a community table for all the singles so maybe they can make friends! Just a thought. Either way if you want decent food and service this is cool place. Don't go here though if hate families with lots of kids.....",

    "text": "I am writing this review as I suffer from food coma. I just left Babbo after chowing down a big bowl of pasta, bread and spring mix salad. Let's say my lunch meeting went by well.   What I love about Babbo is the variety of options to choose from. If you feel like pasta one day you can grab a bowl. If you feel like pizza they have different pizzas to choose from in various different sizes. Then if you feel like salad or adding a salad they have a nice selection of salads to choose from.   I am a boring pasta, pizza and salad person. My order looks like something you would request for your kids. I am still hooked on the traditional marinara pasta in a bowl. No meat or cheese. Just the sauce. This is the ONLY restaurant that has ever got it right and it taste good every time. The Spring Mix Salad is my absolute favorite pick on the menu. That dressing tops it off but something about the sweet golden raisins they add. The bread well that is a whole different story. I have this theory if a restaurants bread does not taste good how can the food. Babbo has mastered the bread.  Let's say you will fight over the last piece with your guest that is how good it is. They provide you with oil and vinegar to dip it that makes the bread melt in your mouth.   I have used Babbo in the past for catering for large parties. They have never made a mistake and the food is always looks like a presentation out of a magazine. That has only helped me look good at work. Defiantly an establishment you can trust for large catering needs.   It has been amazing watching this Italian Eatery grow. I saw this restaurant move in to my neighborhood then had a dining experience at the Women's Expo many years ago that had me sold. They have a dynamic culture which is why there service is always great. Along with a hip menu that is mighty tasty.",

Bread is sliced thin and comes with a blend of Italian Oils which was a good combination. They brought out more bread as we ran out and made sure we were taken care of.   Service was very good with them filling up the drinks quite often.  Pricing for their meals were average to lower end ranging from  $9 - $13 which is good on the pocket book.  Menu is pretty extensive with pizza, pasta, salads and calzones.  First time here and certainly not the last, will be back another time.",

Emailed specials are seldom but  are great! :)",

    "text": "It's tough to impress an Italian girl with Italian food. Babbo Italian Eatery left an impression and it was \"molto bene!\"   The ambiance at Babbo Italian Eatery was cool and urban. It's a dimly lit restaurant; one that's good by day, but I suspect better by night. They have a nice little patio which was a bit noisy (too noisy to hear my favorite band emanating through the speakers!) but that's to be expected at a busy CenPho intersection. I imagine even cool winter nights would be pleasant on the patio warmed by electric heaters. And for what it's worth (I think the ladies will back me on this one) I was very happy to notice the restroom was clean and attractive.   I ordered the Steak and Pesto Pasta (flank steak, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and pesto over penne and topped with shreds of Parmesan and basil.) It was colorful, flavorful and plentful...so much so I could only finish about half. It was slightly on the oily side, but that's par for the course with pesto. The meal also came with a nearly-warm herbed focaccia along with a \"not-too-heavy\" oil and \"just-the-right-amount-of-kick\" balsamic plate for dipping.   The service was fast and friendly; the server even chatting me up for a few minutes. He's leaving Arizona soon so I hope the other servers are just as personable on my future visits. For today's visit, Babbo Italian Eatery was \"squisito\"!",

Our waitress brought out fresh, warm bread with a balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil dipping sauce... oh my! I knew I was going to eat waaayyyyy too much, but I didn't even care! We were trying to pick which pasta we wanted (such a large variety) and everyone was so happy with their selection when the entrees came out (but of course, mine was the best.) Try the Supremo Alfredo with shrimp next time you stop in! We also had a chocolate chunk cookie (with ice cream) for dessert and that was unbelievably delicious.  As much as I love their food, the service was even better. Our waitress, Jessica, was just a ball of sunshine. She was so so soooo sweet and constantly checked on us and made sure we were okay. Craig, our bartender, was just as amazing! He is so funny and such a delight to be around!   I have cravings for Italian food ALL the time, but we always went to different Italian spots... never again! Best service and food I've had in a loooong time! 5 stars any day!",

Was told it was a cross between reg spag and Angel hair w t h???? Well it still had the boiling water in the dish around 1/4 cup of it and the meatballs were COLD Why??? On my kitchen The meatballs are within the sauce (right)?The waiter was mortified we assured him he was not the problem we paid for our drinks and gave him the price of the check as a tip they really DROPPED the meatball on this one kitchen really screwed up ooh and there was one guy that kept coming out and eyeballing us they may have had a better result if they had been eyeballing the quality of their product",

We weren't expecting much since we're always seeing billboards for $5.99 pasta on Monday's and Tuesday's. How great can a place be if they sell pasta for that price?  Well, it was amazing!!  We both ordered off the chalkboard menu, my bf got the chicken and I had the portabella mushroom. Between my margaritta, the bread, our salads and a decent size portion of dinner, I had left overs. He doesn't normally have a hard time deciding what to get but he kept flipping back and forth since there are soooo many good options.   I'm hoping they run another groupon soon, we're coming back regardless but it would be nice to save a few dollars =)",

I emailed to ask about their gluten free cooking practices and they answered back quickly and with great information!  I feel safe eating here based on what I've been told and have seen.  As of this writing, all of their sauces are gluten free.  Their chicken is marinated in a soy based sauce that may or may NOT be gf so be forwarned!  They cook their gf pasta in it's own water as opposed to plopping it into used regular pasta water (which means it's no longer gf and is a way some restaurants which serve gf pasta do it, so be careful and ASK!)  The pasta and the sauce was fresh and flavorful.  The bread smelled divine and I was totally bummed that I couldn't have any!  The service was good and our food came out fast!  I will be tripping around this menu for sure!  Awesomesauce!",

For some reason, I am pretty picky about Italian food to the point that in the rarely choose Italian restaurants or order pasta dishes. I guess I'm easily disappointed and prefer to make it myself (no I am not Italian, or a chef). I tried an asparagus and mushroom based pasta dish and I was impressed! It was absolutely delicious. I wouldn't compare it to the truly authentic dishes that I've had and loved elsewhere, but it didn't taste bland, generic, or microwaved. I was inspired to make a similar dish later that week. My friends loved their food as well (pasta), we all ate the majority of our meals. The bread served is also very good, and our service was great. I would definitely go back, and recommend this place to others.",

I was greeted by Nathalie who, seeing that I was the only one in my party, suggested that I sit at the bar which I was completely amenable to.   Chrissie, the bartender was a delight.  I watched as she deftly handled many customers, both in-house and to-go, with a smile and a heartfelt cheeriness.  Everyone working there seemed to be in a good mood and ready to help.  I asked her about the \"chalkboard\" specials where you pick either chicken or portabello, a topping of some kind of vegetable of which there were many to choose from, then a salad.  I ordered chicken with beets and brussels sprouts and a mista salad.    The salad set the tone with black olives, tomatoes, basil, lots of spring lettuce tossed in a house vinaigrette - it was an unforgettable salad.  My food came just as I finished my salad.  The chicken was cooked perfectly by Eduardo and was topped with roasted brussels sprouts and beets with goat cheese and almonds and came with a side of roasted broccoli, cauliflower, red onions and carrots.    My brain is still very happy for having this gastronomical treat.  I got a big ole SE grin on my face while I was eating it because it was JUST THAT GOOD.  A couple came in after I finished and I wanted to tell them all about the food but they were regulars and were already well-equipped for this place.  As a matter of fact, the lady's usual was the meal I had just had!  I joined Yelp tonight just so I could write this review.  Babbo, if you need a marketing person, please give me a call cuz I just joined the choir.",

I ordered the \"Super Food Pasta: pesto, Tuscan kale, spinach, green onions, red chili and garlic in a white wine sauce\" served on top of whole wheat penne pasta. What I received with dried whole wheat penne pasta in olive oil with two tablespoons of kale, and a teaspoon of melted parmesan cheese. I saw no spinach, green onions, garlic, red chili, pesto, or white wine sauce. It tasted like cardboard. I walked to the hostess station to see a menu and to address the issue. The gentleman told me the pesto was cooked into the pasta and it's standard to put a parmesan garnish on every dish. I said, \"A two-year-old could cook this dish.\" It was very basic. I then asked for a side of marinara to see if it would save the dish. Nope. The marinara was too salty.   The waiter offered me another dish. I ordered the Kale and Quinoa Salad: red quinoa, kale, roasted cauliflower and chickpeas, corn, roasted red pepper, asparagus, and a basil lemon vinaigrette. What I received was a plate full of kale with tiny hints of all the other ingredients. Tiny sprinkles of red quinoa. A few corn kernels. I saw maybe a dozen chickpeas, no asparagus or roasted red pepper. Maybe it was cooked into the kale. I don't know. The basil lemon vinaigrette might as well been watered down lemon juice. I was starving so I ate anyway.  My mother ordered the Zoodles Arrabbiata: zucchini noodles, marinara, Pomodoro tomato, anchovy paste, onion, and fresh basil. What she received was a bowl full of salty marinara sauce over a few zucchini noodles. She was not happy either.  I mentioned that I too am a cook and according to ingredients, the first item on any ingredient list is usually the main ingredient. Not in this case.  My brother said, \"They cook everything from scratch.\" I said, \"So do I and it doesn't take me this long to get food on the table!\" We waited almost an hour for our food.  No, we will never return.",

Our first visit I had their version of chicken picatta.  Wow.  I love lemon and capers.  The chicken was very yummy.  This dish was so very good. My friend had the mac and cheese and all I can say is it was some of the best stuff ever.   We've tried both the chicken ceaser and chopped wedge salads and they are both very good. They aren't over dressed and have a nice ratio for ingredients.   This past visit we did the spaghetti and meatballs. I substituted the zoodles for pasta and I think I'm never going to have it with pasta. Wow it was good. The meatballs are giant. Like I said it's on special Monday and Tuesday.   They have some happy hour specials as well so I'll have to head back over for that soon. They had a fundraiser for PCH not long ago and that's when we saw them on the news and decided to try them. What a great local business. Thanks Babbo.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I LOVE the food at Babbo. I live down the street and have ordered take out many times and my boyfriend has picked it up. Today is the first time I have ever dined in. I am with my mother who is in from out of town and I raved about this place to her.     Walk in, hostess gives us a hi! I say \"four\" four with the baby or without the baby? Without. She says \"ok let me ask.\" Ask what? Are babies not allowed? She came back and said \"right this way.\" But then quickly turned around and said \"wait let me check on it\" ok. No prob. We are seated and we wait. And wait. And wait some more. 5-6 employed walk past us and not one acknowledges our presence. I was a server for 14 years and when people don't have the  courtesy to say hello it really irritates me. After about 10 mins I make eye contact with whom I assume is a busser and I hear him go near the pos and say \"you have a table. They've been here for a while\"  Server brings over oil and asks for drink order. Says bread will be right out. 15 mins later bread comes out. Before the bread came out both of our appetizers did. The tomatoes on the stuffed portabella were literally ice cold. The rest of our food came out on time, but was pretty disappointing. My Brussels sprouts pizza had about 5 split sprouts. The chipotle pasta had no sick and the sauce was extremely runny. All in all I am so disappointed in Babbo and wish I would have chosen a different restaurant to bring out of town guests. I probably will not return. There seems to be no management at all...  ****update*****  As you can see, Babbo contacted me and we exchanged emails. They said they would send a gift card since we had such a bad experience and then never did. So now I have even worse feelings towards them and probably won't even order carry out from there anymore. Horrible business practice",

So, on our way home, we found ourselves about five minutes from this location... perfect chance to try it.  She knows what I like, bless her heart, and I was not disappointed in Babbo.  They start you off with soft focaccia bread, which, when it's 2:30 in the afternoon and this is your first meal, does not last long. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar are poured on a plate for your dipping pleasure. Very good.  Daughter #1and I had the pizza and salad special. We both got the Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom pizza. I got the Mista salad and she got the house salad. The only thing on the salad she did not like, was the golden raisins. She picked them out and put them on my plate... I was happy to oblige. You could see them in the kitchen tossing pizza dough, so we got nice, fresh pizza. My daughter announced, \"this is the best pizza I have ever had\". I won't go that far, but it was really good.  Daughter #2 - Fettuccine Alfredo (I think she must have cream and parmesan cheese coursing through her veins by now). was enjoyed thoroughly.  Wife - Pasta Martini (their version of Penne Vodka) was her choice. She enjoyed it, but the addition of Kalamata olives was slightly odd. She said it was overkill and seemed like they did not belong.  I liked the ambience and the price was fairly reasonable. Babbo seems to be a Phoenix chain. It would be nice if they would expand into an area near us. I think I would be a regular.",

We will be going this Monday for their $5.99 Spaghetti & Meet ball plate. It's a huge portion and it is ROCKIN!! I usually order their spring mix salad with my spagetti. For lunch I get the spring mix salad with roasted asparagus, it's so good. Oh, I almost forgot, all you can eat bread and olive oil & vinager. I'm pretty sure the bread is home made and I usually have them bring the olive oil & vinager in seperate plates. My kids put grated parmasean on the side of the plate and dip it in the parm after the wet it up. This really is as close to home made that your gonna get, as far as I know, except maybe Bucca Di Beppo's, I love that place too!",

I did and received no response. I then tried to contact them through a Yelp message directly, and still no response. I am now completely and utterly disgusted with Babbo for the severe lack of customer service and neglect of their customers. It was one thing to have a negative experience and state that I (may) never go back, and be contacted by someone from their establishment who \"claims\" to want to rectify the problem, only to be ignored. So for anyone who loves Italian food and wants good, quality service with delicious food at a great price, try Red Devil.

Babbo did away with the old floorplan completely and turned it into a really nice little modern neighborhood spot.  I sat at the bar alone and had the penne with pink sauce, garlic, and chicken. It was a ginormous bowl of pasta for $10 and I think I may be one of the only ones who could actually finish it. VALUE. It wasn't super low quality crap either. It was decent food. They also include your before dinner bread and olive oil. All and all with an iced tea it was $14 including tip.   It's a solid place and the staff was very friendly. I had conversation with three staff members while I was there and they all seemed happy to work where they do. Happy staff = happy customers.",

I had the lunch combo (for $9) it included a side salad and a personal pizza. I got the Mista salad which had a ton of deliciousness; mixed greens, mushrooms, olives, pepperocini, mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. It was a big portion size for a side salad. For the pizza I had the Bianca pizza which had ricotta cheese (one of my favorites), tomatoes, spinach and rosemary. I love Bianca pizza but some places make it greasy or put some crazy white sauce on it. This bianca pizza was delicious. This is a great deal for lunch because I barely ate my pizza so it was like having 2 meals for 1. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back to for lunch or to try one of calzones.",

The waiter came over shortly after we sat down and asked if we knew what we wanted. Having never been there before and looking at their pretty extensive menu I said we needed a few minutes. I guess we should have just picked something right then and there because he never came back. We sat for 20 minutes, tried to make eye contact with someone, anyone, but no luck. Our waiter even went to tables near us to clean plates but never looked our way. So we got up and left. Guess we can cross Babbo off our list. Oh well, seemed like a cross between Olive Garden and Denny's anyway.",

The bartender was super friendly and took care of anything we needed while still running the rest of the bar and making drinks for the servers. Did really well!  We started out with some fresh bread with oil and vinegar. This bread was AMAZING so soft, fresh, warm, and just made you want keep eating it non-stop.   The appetizers we ordered were the Toasted Italian Bread, Garlic, Mozzarella, Romano Cheese, Side of Marinara and the limited time only Panko Breaded Mozza Balls. The garlic cheese bread was with marinara was to die for.  However, the star of the appetizers was the Panko Crusted Mozza Balls!!! These are two LARGE balls of mozzarella coated in panko break crumbs and deep fried. These area INCREDIBLE!!!! Them come with a meat marinara sauce and it a great match. These are a limited time item STOP READING THIS AND GO GET THEM!  Ok now that's over if you have the strength to continue it's main course time. I decide to go traditional with Spaghetti & Meatballs Marinara Sauce, Meatballs, Parmesan, Oregano, Basil. Served on Spaghettini. This was an extremely well prepared dish and the meatballs had great flavor. The Spaghettini pasta has a little different texture if you have not tried it before. Its a little dense but tasty.  My wife had the Italian Sausage Pasta Marinara Sauce, Spicy Italian Sausage, Mixed Peppers, Mushrooms, Marsala Wine, Parmesan Cheese. Served on Penne. The sausage is actually pretty spicy and my wife enjoys spicy food and she even was a little surprised. The dish had great flavor with the sausage and pepper blend.  The deserts were the reason for going with four stars instead of five.   We each got a dessert to go and I tried the Chocolate Torte. It was not bad a bit of chocolate overload for sure. Very rich and not something I recommend to eat all at once. There was a strange after taste from the caramel mixed in as well.  The Tiramisu was absolutely disgusting! DO NOT ORDER the Tiramisu. We have both enjoyed this style dish all over the country and this was gross. I hate to be so rude about it but I have to be honest. It was runny, soupy, and just tasted horrible!   Overall with the exception of the deserts we did have a great dinner. I would still recommend coming here if you get the chance. Just steer clear of these two deserts",

Fantastic Crab and artichoke dip... Wonderful... Just ask for extra bread  Overall great experience.  Oh and my daughter said that the bathroom was cute!",

Is it good? Definitely!  As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.  However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.  I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.  They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.  Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)",

Tonight was my second visit in the past month. My first was good. Not great, not Yelp worthy. My second being tonight the service alone stood out to me. Our server Aiden was extremely friendly and eager to make sure my son and I were satisfied. Even while others stood around twiddling their thumbs, Aiden hustled and kept a genuine smile. The food was better than my last visit. Overall, if you order right and luck out with a great server it is a great local spot!",

    "text": "I love posting great reviews-unfortunately, this isn't one. Our first time here for a fun spontaneous visit. Weren't told about happy hour time/special by hostess or server until I saw the sign after tried ordering. When I asked what it was: was told all wines under $9 are $5. It was right in HH time.  Was given a sample to try of a cab when I inquired about spicy and flavor. Thats great. Waitress had NO idea and seemed lost. I choose a regular $8 glass Asked about firecracker egg rolls as in is it spicy? Server mmmm I don't know. Depends lol. So we order just asking that the buffalo stays off just in case never knowing it comes with 3 flavors? I guess. None was explained.  Once it came half looked cooked other half was red or pink inside, looking as if raw. We also asked which was which of 2 flavors, server didn't know, called someone else over who also didn't know. To be sure found manager who explained it was cooked Italian meats. By then it was turn off although the salad in between was delicious along with excellent seasoned focaccia bread with dipping olive oil.  We ordered pastas -over cooked. They were kind enough to accommodate my 10 year old kinda picky eater who first thought she wanted spaghetti and meatballs -which she loves, wherever we go. She tried it and couldn't eat it. They kindly brought over noodles Alfredo at her request without wrinkling a brow, thank you BTW, we paid higher adult dinner price anyway. I just wanted her to eat. Sigh. which she didn't eat either. After I finished my salad I found out why. Noodles weren't outright sticky mushy just way over cooked. Easiest thing in kitchen to ensure is right and consistent to ensure it NEVER happens. Ordering a meal to go was trying as server didn't know there was 2 bolagnese descriptions on menu? I needed to know difference to not waste money and order it. Manager helped. Took it home along with pasta not eaten. No one wanted to eat it that night or next. I never told my husband of our experience or pasta was over cooked. He tastes and didn't eat it. He was being polite lol   Sad servers don't know basics of menu, food is over cooked and a $40/50 is just bleh. I don't need an4/5 star. Just edible and without incident. Oh also my happy hour $5 wine was $6? Who cares but I didn't misunderstand. I paid for it as we just wanted to go home.   bad night perhaps? Manager Joe listened and intervened for appetizers but isn't aware of overlooked pasta. I didn't like \"complaining\" again. it's front and back house job to ensure quality at ALL times. As manager of anything- I wouldn't ever assume my team doesn't need constant on spot training and QA checks, it's why the job exists.  This is a simple fix here.",

We ordered Gorgonzola salad and the Creamy Mushroom, Asparagus Pasta and added shrimp for $5.95. The salad was great and very plentiful of veggies, fruit and cheese, highly recommend. We were really disappointed with the pasta dish. We got it to go and felt the noodles were half portion and we literally got four small shrimp.  I am hoping someone responds to provide us a redo on the pasta take out as it wasn't a full order and we want to give it another shot. I'd give 2.5 stars but wasn't an option. Thank you.",

    "text": "Words cannot describe how phenomenal Babbo's Italian Eatery's catering has been for our wedding. Not only is the company same-sex wedding friendly, but their excellent customer service really made our wedding planning experience so much more enjoyable. When we went for our tasting, the staff was super helpful and we got to try pretty much everything on the menu (and got to take home a lot of leftovers since the servings were full size). My husband and I brought mothers along (who both have quite the picky taste pallets since they are great cooks themselves). I lost count of the number of dishes we tried, but each one of them was so tasty, it made our decision process so difficult. My husband's favorite was the Asparagus Fra Diavolo, and I loved the  Tuscan chicken and three cheese mac and cheese. During our tasting, we were given full sized portions which gave us enough or us to make the difficult to narrowing down which delicious dishes we'd like to have at our wedding. We ended up choosing 2 appetizers (pesto bruschetta and mini meatballs), 2 salads (brussel sprout and beet salad, and the Napa salad), 2 pasta dishes (Pasta Primavera and Three Cheese Mac and Cheese), 2 entrees (Asparagus Fra Diavolo and Tuscan Chicken) and a coffee bar for our wedding which gave everyone several options to choose from (even for the pickiest of eaters). At our wedding, the guests were head over heels about how the quality of the food far surpassed their expectations to the point that they even said they will visit one Babbo's many valley locations just to have their food again! We can't wait to visit Babbo's Italian eatery again and taste even more of their delicious dishes. A++ rating overall.",

They also serve a complentary bread (warm, sliced, garlic, & red onions).  I do not know if we were hungry or it was GOOD, we had a second plate.  LOL!

On our bimonthly dinner outing with my mother, we picked Italian and she suggested we come to Babbo's as i am always reluctant to try new Italian places because of my Italian heritage has set the bar really high, and most Italian seem to disappoint.  I must say Babbo's did not disappoint me.    We came on a Tuesday night which is spaghetti and meatball special night, and all though the restaurant was very busy, I feel the service was great. As busy as Scott (our server) was he was very attentive.  Scott was knowledgeable of his menu and of the restaurant. Great job, cause he was able to accommodate my demanding mom.   We did not know of the special before we came, and as we where being seated I notice a lot of people had \"the special\"  I ask our waiter if it was the special and he told us on Monday/Tuesday nights that's what the special was.  What I noticed about \"the special\" was the meatballs were huge, and the spaghetti had an ample amount of sauce in and on the spaghetti  which I love, because it all about the the sauce.   which was a very simple great favored sauce.      It was so good I got 2 additional \"specials\" TOGO.  I have to be honest after finding out what the special was I did not look at most of the menu, but the pricing seemed very fair overall. And i guess i will just have to go again to try other dishes.  I gave 5 stars because my overall experience was great.  The only compliant I have is the add on salad is $3.95 and is super tiny. And it is a reach out to management to make the salad less expense or make it bigger.      I am glad to see that they have location in the northwest metro phoenix area since we live in the southwest area of metro phoenix.   If you would open in the Goodyear/Avondale area I promise to become a regular",

I share with her my frustration and tell her I'll need to speak to the manager.  He comes over and states that the group was there first. This was all based on her trying to cover it up by saying the lady in the group was in the restroom when I walked in.  She lied it was the husband that went to the restroom after I moved to make room for her and an older man.  There's no way I would have to make room for them if they came in before me.    The manager agreed to give us a 20% discount. Next a lady who is trying to quiet her newborn is walking around her table when she causes our server to spill all our meals.   Our meals are delayed, and overall we only received a 20% discount.  I'm an ongoing patron, most of the time is for take out.  This was a horrible night to eat in.  The dinner experience was way too long and the two mistakes don't justify such a small discount.  I was one of their first clients when they moved in to the neighborhood.  Good thing is that there is more dining options in our area.",

Shes great with customers explaining the menu and getting drinks and food to us fast not only that Shes just so nice! when me and my roommate come we don't waste our time getting a table the waiters suck and the manager (skinny guy who looks like he hates his job)suck. Every time I come in the Manager is rude to his employees and Doesn't respect them. Never says please or thank you he just looks like he doesn't want to be there instead helping staff he just makes small talk with guest. I'm never as happy with table as I am sitting at the bar. Thank you Kristine for the excellent service and the only reason my roommate and I still come here every week!  By the way I work for HR and Customer service and the only way to make happy customers is to keep good happy employees. To improve your business that's a good place to start!",

The portions sizes are very large. Whenever my husband and I order food, we always have leftovers for the next day--part of the reason we love ordering from there.

It was Monday night, and they had a $5.99 spaghetti special that I didn't even know about.    The place was packed when we arrived, and the decor is quite nice.  The ambience was good as well, with muted conversations all around us.  We were seated quickly and the service was quite fast, especially considering the crowded nature of the place due to the special.  We ordered an appetizer of special egg rolls ($7.50) filled with steak, chicken and ground beef.  The steak one was the best, but all of them were great, and the spicy sauce for dipping was amazing.  The little salad on the side was a nice touch as well, along with the standard roasted bread they bring for free, served with oil and vinegar.  Yum...yum.    We both ordered the special and it was really quite good.  The meatballs were pretty good and much better than Buca di Beppo's nasty meatballs.  There was a little too much sauce, but at least it was slightly sweet and tasty.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, and overall this is one of the better dining experiences I've had recently, much better than The Old Spaghetti Factory I went to Sunday night with some friends.    I give it an A- and will be back with more friends soon.  Very soon, in fact.",

The Gorgonzola salad was pretty good. The chicken in it was clean- no gross grisly bits. They serve their salads on plates and in bowls that are obviously too small. So you end up spilling a lot off the sides.  The cheese pizza- the 4 y.o. liked it, the 7 y.o. and I did not.  The calzone was cool inside and undercooked.  The manicotti was \"pretty good\" (says my husband).  It's unfortunate because this place is so close to where we live and hike and go to the park and I really can't see myself choosing to go back. I'd go if others picked it but I'd only get that gorgonzola  salad.",

    "text": "My husband and I love this place.  It is so close to where we live, that when we decide last minute that we don't want to cook, we more than likely call Babbo for carryout.  It is best on Mondays and Tuesdays because they have spaghetti and meatball for $5.99.  They are huge portions too.  It also comes with garlic bread, which is really good.  Sometimes we split 1 and are completely satisfied with that.  I also had the Pasta Rustico, which was really good as well.  We've never dined in though, so I can't really say what that experience would be.",

    "text": "Very cute little restaurant that fits well with the neighborhood. I ordered online tonight because I saw they had gluten free pasta available. I arrive 15 minutes later as my food was just coming up. The bartender was extremely kind and seemed to have a great attitude. She was a shorter girl with brown hair. She packaged it up quickly and I was on my way. I arrived home 30 minutes later and my pasta was still piping hot! They cooked the gluten free pasta perfectly in my chicken Alfredo. I love the added vegetables. The only thing I would change is the chicken was very chewy, too overlooked. I'll be ordering again!",
