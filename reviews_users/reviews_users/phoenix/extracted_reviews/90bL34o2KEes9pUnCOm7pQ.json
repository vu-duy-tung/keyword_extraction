Their sausage, pretzels, cheese app is really good, albeit very simple.  I always get, and always recommend The Chopped Salad.  It's a thing of beauty and is one of, if not, the best salads I've ever had.  For the main course, they're all good but I like the Filet the best!  Enjoy!!  PS, if you get a cocktail, spring for the giant ice ball.  It is super fun and the proceeds go to charity!  :D",

The meals ranged from delicious (eggs Bernie-dict) to \"what the??\" (Biscuit and gravy).  A single biscuit in a bowl of \"gravy\" which was actually cream of celery soup with some sausage crumbled in it.  Weird.  Could not eat the gravy at all.  The biscuit was good, but only one regular sized biscuit.  The french toast was average, and the classic Benedict was good.  With only a few brunch items on the menu, I expected everything to be awesome.  It seemed hit or miss though.",

I've never had brussel sprouts paired with grits before and I thought it was great! A little on the rich side but very different and delicious.   I ordered the \"original chopped salad.\" Chopped salads are not usually something I like but this one was very unique with the trail mix and the smoked salmon. I could eat this any day! My other lunch partners all ordered the steak salad which looked equally delicious. Great place with a fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back next time I'm in AZ.",

I'd stay away from them, very small and lots of ice & didn't taste very good. But if you're into whiskey & bourbon, they have an extensive menu! The table side ice ball is a must!  I ordered the mushroom soup (soup of the day), it was delicious! They also had an off menu option of steelhead crudo. Sooooo good! I would go back for that if they made it a permanent menu item. Husband tried the tuna and the egg roll, he liked both items.  Some friends ordered the sea bass and Chilean cakes, the sea bass was a bit salty, but was cooked well and the potatoes underneath were yummy! The  cakes were good, lots of meat, but also a lot of seasoning.  The caramel pudding dessert was amazing!! The bread pudding was also very good! The chocolate torte was yummy, but very rich. We also tried an off menu dessert that was like a deconstructed cheesecake. Only 1 of 7 of our group was a fan. Personally, I hated it.  Great service and waiter, we all had an amazing time and left very happy with the meal overall.",

    "text": "The Gladly is so next level it's not even funny. My wife and I came here on the first day of Restaurant Week, having managed to snag a last minute reservation through Open Table. Being a fan of craft cocktails, I started my meal with the Beginner's Luck, a play on a traditional Manhattan with bourbon, Amaro, Morlacco, cherry liqueur, and bitters. Let me tell you, you haven't lived until you've had someone make a cocktail in front of you using a \"sashimi-grade\" ice ball.  For the first course, I opted for the chopped salad, while my wife had the squash soup. Due to a mix up, we both ended up getting salad, but the brought out the soup anyway. Fantastic customer service. The chopped salad has a great mix of texture, with the added bonus that none of the individual ingredients get lost in the mix. Delicious.  My main was the duck meatloaf. It was out of this world. Moist, with a delicate balance of savory and sweet, the meatloaf is also a large portion. I barely made it through with room for dessert. Speaking of which, you should definitely go for the bread pudding.  Service at The Gladly was prompt, warm and professional Our server had an intimate knowledge of the menu and was able to walk us through each course with ease. I would definitely come here again for date night and sample their full menu. I'd say their participation in Restaurant Week was a mission accomplished. We tried a new place and found a new favorite.",

    "text": "Restaurants like this are few and far between.   Let me start off by saying this review is long overdue. This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix thus far!! I'm a NYC native, food snob, foodie and that friend when finds something great loves to share it with her friends. With that being said:  1. The food here is incredible! I mean incredible! I have went there several times with a set of new friends each time everyone ranted and raved about the food. We like to order a bunch of dishes and share a bite and no dish I have tasted was below average. Just thinking about the dishes makes my mouth water right now lol.  2. The staff is attentive, friendly and makes you feel very welcome. The manager (Christine?) I'm sorry if I messed up your name!* came by always making sure we were taken care of and had time to chat with us making us feel welcomed. The waiter gave us a percentage off b/c my sister is serving as a policewoman. So thoughtful and kind!!  3. The atmosphere gives you a cozy, sexy and simple elegance feeling...you can feel at home in a business suit or just casual wears. Lunch with a friend, a date or just a night out for dinner to satiate that certain palette tingler.  4. Did I mention the whiskey /scotch library and the ice cube maker???   This place is phenomenal and a bang for your buck serving you high quality on everything.  Thank you Gladly for being my go to place when my friends and family are in town, or a good girls night out. :)",

Even during the lunch rush everything was prompt. The staff truly pays attention to every detail.  John, our server, was so incredible. He went above and beyond to welcome us. He explained the menus in great detail, anticipated our every need, and provided epic service throughout our meal.   We shared the famous chopped salad, the wagyu burger, and the chicken club sandwich. The salad was a textural delight, a fresh smorgasbord of flavors choreographed around glorious pink salmon. The burger was our favorite. Extremely juicy, flavorful, top shelf beef served medium rare paired with tangy, pungent cheese and caramelized amazingness. The chicken club was perfectly balanced with thick cut bacon with a hint of smokey maple goodness. Even the sides were oh so on point: french fries with a whisper of rosemary (I will dream of these) and a leafy arugula side salad with sweet and savory elements were easy to devour.   I'm obsessed. 10 stars!",

Great drink selection and have 200 different whiskeys to choose from. Great to go on a Sunday as they have all day happy hour. Must haves are for sure the original chopped salad, wings, and the wagyu burger. I wish they were open later on weeknights!",

Right  off the bat definitely thought the aesthetics were very nice and it looked like a nicer than casual type restaurant.  The ambiance was very warm and we were greeted with warm hellos and smiles.  Our waiter Nathan was very nice and very friendly and was able to offer nice drink recommendations.  Their Manhattan was on point, and MAKE SURE you eat that in-house maraschino at the end that's been marinating in maple syrup and bourbon all day, it's a like a cherry jelly bean.  If you are a fan of whiskey's they have quite the extensive list, I think I saw up to 100+ on their list.  Being a fan of Citizens already I already knew to get the Original Chopped Salad which is a must even if you've had it before.  Next to come was an off menu Ceviche which is a no-brainer to me as well.  (I always get excited to hear about the off menu items) and my girlfriend wanted to try the pistachio and chicken pate.  To top off the night again emulating my love for Citizens I got their meatloaf, but the Gladly makes theirs with Duck making for a richer flavor, but absolutely delicious.  Needless to say my girlfriend and my eyes may have been a little too big for our stomachs, but still well worth it.  The Gladly is definitely up there now on one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good food and nice drinks (esp. Whiskey-based).  Cheers!",

Sprouting from the infamous Cowboy Caio, The Gladly is similarly conceived in that it is absolutely stupendous. Dissimilar from its big brother, The Gladly is upscale to the Nth degree in terms of air, atmosphere, and environment.   Service was what I'd call out-of-this-world, featuring our very own extraterrestrial waiter named Tim, who was about as friendly, personable, funny, and awesome as any earthling brain can fathom. He had excellent recommendations, and upon his antenna sensing our distress between ordering the Hillbilly Egg Roll (featuring Little Miss BBQ meat of the day!) and the Pistachio Chicken Liver Plate for our appetizer, he decided to expedite the whole thing and hook us up with the Pistachio Chicken Liver Plate, on the house. We still ordered the Hillbilly Egg Roll, and both we totally delicious.   We ordered the Shiitake Braised Short Ribs for our main course. Again, utilizing their extrasensory abilities, they served the plate split into two equal half plates, because they just know what's up. And again, also delicious, bordering exquisite.   To watch the making of their \"Conflagration Nation\" (with one of those tobacco smoke tricks), we sat up at the bar and got talking to the bartender. He was very passionate about the drinks and explained all the details in making each of the cocktails we ordered, which consisted of the aforementioned Conflagrations Nation, the Lafayette Preserve, the Thai Margarita, and their Sazerac, as well as a specialty off-menu drink that was along the line of a whiskey sour with an egg white twist.   This caliber of restaurant comes at a price, but if you feel like doing something special, this will surpass your expectations, especially in terms of service. Literally every preconceived notion I had irrationally erected high into the sky before my visit was actually exceeded, so this is a definite 5 stars, plus this ridiculous review if you still weren't convinced.",

This restaurant has both great service, and great food, something that is missing in at ALL the other hipster restaurants that have been popping up over the last few years.  For starters, they accept reservations, even for small parties.  None of this 45 minute wait for mediocre food/service, we barely made it through the door before they were walking us to our table. There was plenty of parking, and no mandatory $ valet.    As you know, service can make or break the meal, and Phillip did an amazing job at entertaining, and informing us.  He could make any of the aforementioned restaurants a palatable place to eat.  His combination of wit and wisdom kept you guessing on what he'd say next.  The bus staff was clearly on-top of everything, as our every needs were met before we realized we needed something.  Our table had: Duck Meatloaf, Short Ribs, Cobia fish dish, Chopped Salad, and Kale Salad.  Everything was perfectly created, cooked, and presented.  It's a bit pricy to be going weekly, but I certainly will be going back monthly.",

    "text": "Finally went to Gladly last night. Been meaning to come for some time. Definitely worth the wait! Service-Excellent! The hostess is very attentive, opening the door for guests and greeting them with a genuine smile.  The bus boys and girls fill your water and clear your plates in an extremely efficient manner.  Our waitress was very informative, engaging and her recommendations were spot on.  My wife enjoyed the summer crush cocktail while I had the beginner's luck. A great start to a great meal.  For apps we shared the chicken liver pate and chopped salad. Both amazing. I'm not a liver fan but this worked. Spreading it on the crostini with the spicy mustard & pickled onion was delicious.  The chopped salad was as advertised-amazing. Different textures and great flavor. Refreshing and not too filling.  My wife had the sea bass which was excellent-seasoned and cooked perfectly and the potatoes were creamy and full of flavor.  I had the short ribs which were tender and delicious. Portion was surprisingly big and the mashed sweet potato was great and Chinese broccoli amazing.  For desert we had the banana and vanilla pudding with sea salt caramel and pb biscotti. Almost licked the jar.  The overall dining experience was fantastic. I will definitely return!",

I also got the burger and it was moderately good. It was dry, I would never get it again. One of my friends got the scallops and loved them. The duck meatloaf was good also, I don't love duck though so I recognize it was very good but....We ordered the ice ball service with our drink- which if you have never done I highly recommend it is fun- but she called it \"sushi grade\" ice, I wanted to vomit from the pompousness of that- seriously what is that? Really absurd. I am willing to give it another go because of the decor and dogs but, sadly, I was not overly impressed.",

My bestie and I were pretty hungry so we ordered food first and decided we would hold out for drinks until happy hour started when they were cheaper...because, college. But we still like to treat ourselves. Happy hour is perfect for that. Good food, fancy places, less money! I ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich and the bestie ordered the chicken club. Both got fries, of course. NOTHING IS A BETTER ACCOMPANIMENT THAN FRIED STARCH. They make their own ketchup in house, it's not your classic Heinz flavor, it's a bit sweeter and has more of an oregano flavor, but good! The sandwiches were fantastic, recommend both! Now, the important part. Drinks. The Gladly has hundreds of different whiskeys- our booze of choice. They have different drink specials daily. Their manhattan is sweetened with a mixture of Guinness and maple syrup. Must have.",

Carmel with banana cream pudding and a homemade marshmallow topping, now just try to top that.  I can't wait to go back and will definitely do so later this week.

The large windows that look to Camelback Road make it feel like you are sitting in a department store. Greenery outdoors appears limited to overgrown sage on the verge of becoming tumbleweed. What does any of this have to do with the food? Appetizers (lamb ribs, Brussels sprouts) were excellent and Gladly happily gives a robust serving go greens with their salads. The burrata was not memorable and appetizer quite cold. Salad dressings flavorful. Unfortunately, eats and ambience didn't encourage us to linger. However, for a Benjamin, we were full. Will concede that we caught additional eats elsewhere.",

He was very friendly, kinda goofy but totally knowledgeable about the drinks. Tons and tons of whiskeys! I had a vodka soda. Lol! We were seated with Terrance and he was also very knowledgeable about the menu, made some awesome suggestions and we loved everything we had which was....scallops with the most delicious corn grits ever! They were topped with pea tendrils which were chewy but really tasted like peas! Weird. I had the short ribs with a blueberry compote but chose the smashed yukon potatoes instead of whatever it came with. Amazing. Juicy, tender and portioned perfectly! The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with the mashed yukons as well. For dessert....banana cream pot with a peanut butter crumble and the chocolate flourless cake with mint chip ice cream. Wow. Delicious. The mint chip ice cream tasted so fresh. I might add that we told Terrance of my friends tree nut allergy and he told us the cake was made with almond flour but the banana pot was fine. You usually don't find servers that know these things.  The food and service, including the busser, who kept our water full all night,  were absolutely superb. We can't wait to go back!",

Heavy, oversalted, somewhat unsophisticated and over-portioned food. The chef is gadding too much sauce on everything & pork and chocolate everywhere they do not belong. We ordered 3 different entries and none of us liked ours very much. The appetizers and service were good. The dessert menu was very underwhelming. So far a 3 start review. But for $50 a person all of the above is way overpriced thus a 1 star deduction.  We won't be coming back.",

The chopped salad is a must, and I had the pork shank on special that evening with root vegetables and a creamed corn or cauliflower (I believe) that was absolutely outstanding! However, we went with a group of us on a Wednesday, and the service left a lot to be desired. I swear our server was working the entire restaurant by himself. There were nine of us, and we would go nearly 30 minutes without seeing him or being checked on. The drinks and food took FOREVER, it was painful. Also, I made reservations and was not informed when making the reservation that checks are unable to be split. I am fine with this practice at some restaurants, but I've never not been informed up front that we can't split checks into couples. I don't think I would ever go back in a group setting, this may just be reserved for date nights or smaller get together with one or two friends.",

Sadly when we got seated we found they were out of scallops from the menu, but were subbing in Seabass and fried chicken. I wanted ciopino but mom had her heart set on scallops so I felt bad when she had to settle for the chimichurri chicken.   Our appetizers were great and I got a nice Rye whiskey with an ice ball made table side. Such a cool experience watching them press it for you. The OMFG salad is as good as it sounds, of course. I was really happy with my spicy ciopino but moms chicken was dry and I suspect just an overall letdown from what she anticipated. Desserts were nice, little too much for me but mom took both home so as least she got to end on a good note with treats for days!   I had a great time and will be back...or ordering that salad through UberEATS asap!",

    "text": "We visited for Restaurant Week - so that's the menu I'll be reviewing. Very lovely atmosphere, all shiny clean and new. The patio looks inviting - I'd try that in cooler weather. Our server was efficient and friendly. The Happy Hour prices for cocktails was really good, I probably wouldn't pay full price for what we had. Our prix fixe menu started out with a couple of small bowls of their chopped salad (which is without a doubt the best in the valley, thanks to Citizen Public House.) One of our party had the seafood chowder and raved about it. Two of us had the wagyu burger on a buttermilk bun. The burger was rich and flavorful, the bun was average, and the fingerling potatoes were charred perfectly. One of our party had the chicken - it was dry, flavorless, boring as hell. No sauce, no seasoning, nothing special. I could have made it back in 7th grade Home-Ec class. Seriously. I had the poke - well seasoned, great rice and perfectly fresh tuna. I loved it. I wouldn't spend full price on any of the dishes, but the food (minus the chicken) was really good. The hazelnut torte dessert was a bit dry - ice cream might have helped it out. There are so many choices in the Valley of the Sun, and I'm glad we stopped into The Gladly.",

I love the salad, but I can also get it at their sister restaurant. I have been here at least 4 times and it has all been good, but not enough to make me want to drive this long.  My husband had a humongous burgers, he liked it.  I had a bite and it was very good.  The margarita they have on HH is a little weird tasting, so we won't have that one again.",

The scallops were beautifully cooked and sprinkled with bacon and tossed with some greens over a corn mixture (very similar to grits or polenta..YUM). The service was just as spot-on as the cuisine. If you are looking for a nice date spot, a fun birthday experience, or just want reaaaaaally good food with a hip atmosphere, I would highly recommend The Gladly. We will be back for sure. I already want the chopped salad again and I ate it last night.... yes, that's how yummy!! Enjoy!  Also, I love how much thought they put into everything. We went on New Year's Eve and there was an incredible menu as well as a photo booth. I felt that the waiters and waitresses that were there wanted to be there and loved servicing!! Thank you for making our NYE 2017 so memorable.",

I'm not a big salad eater, but would definitely order that again. I was a little underwhelmed by their cocktails and dessert, but the salad and my entree (salmon) more than made up for it.

I came in celebrating my belated birthday with my parents. It was only my second time coming and oh man was it still just as amazing as my first! Our server was Marisol and she is seriously the sweetest server ever. DESERVES A RAISE STAT.   Anyways, we came for the Sunday Supper. It was sooooooooo good. Like, perfection. Today it was Salisbury Steak, Green Beans, Mashed Potatoes, Biscuits, and Apple Crisp. ALL FOR $25. And the cocktail of the day which ~something~ with roses and strawberry had me SOLD. Drank two!   They made me feel so special too. They set a place card that said 'Happy Birthday from everyone at The Gladly.' Such a simple gesture, but I have yet to see a restaurant do that so I thought that was amazing. Also, they lit candles on a couple of birthday ice cream scoops AND gave me my second drink on the house! Doing all of the above and dealing with my finicky parents makes me haaaaaave to applaud this place!  The city views, the ambience, the service, the food, the drinks. 5 stars ALL around. Best birthday dinner yet. You know I'm coming back.",

We started with the Chopped salad, which was highlighted on the menu - and for good reason. It was perfectly dressed with great flavor combinations. For my entree, I had the grilled filet minion with smashed Yukon Gold potatoes and asparagus. It was cooked expertly rare. The cocktail menu has an excellent whiskey and bourbon selection. I ordered the \"Coffee & Cigarettes,\" with 15 Glenmorangie 10 year single malt Scotch, Borsci elixir, ruby port, Benedictine, bitters, and carved ice. They lit a small pile of loose-leaf tobacco on fire, and placed an overturned glass on top of the plate to absorb the smoky aroma. I've never been a cigarette smoker, but the tobacco essence added some lovely notes to the scotch. They carved the ice into a perfect sphere right at the table - it added an excellent note of entertainment to the cocktail hour.",

The menu is limited, but everything is healthy and beautifully presented. For example, the plate for the chicken liver pate is a flavorful adventure of perfect pate, pickled onions, capers, hot mustard and toasted bread. The Gladly is most noted for its extensive liquor list. Order it straight up, but be sure to order an ice ball to impress your guests. The wait staff is beautiful attired, articulate, knowledgeable and friendly. The Gladly is a place you will be glad you picked for a business meeting or an out-of-town visitor.",

If you take the ice cube out of the drink, my drink was only 1 sip! That tio was $14! I had the only chicken dish they had on the whole menu, and it was tough! It was tasty but very tough. And don't expect free bread here! You have to pay for it, and it's $9 for 3 little pieces of bread! We had 6 people at our table, and we got 3 pieces of bread! And the waiter said he would bring us more bread, making it sound like it was free, but it definitely was not free. He charged us for another order of bread! This place is such a freaking rip off! And my chicken came laying on top of some mushy ass stuff that they called pasta. I've never seen pasta look like that before! It was totally mushy and it looked like oatmeal for God's sake. it was disgusting. They call that risotto but I've never had pasta that looks like mush. We will not be coming back here. Total total rip off. They'll \"gladly\" take your money. By the way, I noticed that they block all the negative reviews and only keep the positive reviews on Yelp. That is very very unfair! The readers are entitled to read good and bad reviews and make their own decisions. That's not cool that you guys block all the bad reviews just so that you guys can get more people at your restaurant!",

    "text": "Original Chopped Salad: It's hard not to claim this as the best salad ever.  I loved the smokey salmon paired with a myriad of ingredients that provided different types of textures.  You got the smokiness of the fish with the sweetness of the corn and slight pepperiness from the arugula.  I loved the pumpkin seeds and currants with the pop of israeli cous cous, which adds an extra chew and oomph through the dish.    Pan Seared Scallops: To me, this was the star of the night!  The taste was a cross between being homey and modern.  The soulfulness of the grits reminded me of mom's home cooking, if my mom was from the south, lol.  It had the creaminess and flavor that would satisfy a hangry stomach. I could have licked the cola gastrique off the dish, which was a perfect acidic hit to the sweet scallops.   Duck Meatloaf: To be honest, not sure what the big hype is in regards to this dish.  Meatloaf, to me, isn't unique or special but I decided to give this one a shot since it was one of the popular items on the menu.  Plus it had foie gras mousseline! How can you say no to foie gras!?  The feeling I got was heavy/semi-dry meatball with the extra gamey-ness that you get out of duck, which completely masked the flavor of the foie gras mousseline (if any) and the cherry demi-glace.  California Seabass: Couldn't get pass the overcooked fish.   Cafe Du Monde Short Ribs: When you tell me that there is smoked blue cheese rice, I am expecting a pungent flavor.  That blue cheese was so mild that it didn't stand out at all.  Short ribs lacked seasoning, but the blueberry-cumin compote was definitely unique and my favorite part of the dish.   Tender Belly Duroc Pork Chop: I am very particular on my risotto and like it a little pass al dente, so perhaps I didn't enjoy it as much due to that reason.   Grilled Filet Mignon: Not my choice to select at a restaurant because the dish is any typical dish you get at American restaurant or steak house.  Met expectations, but nothing that would make me go back.  Chocolate Torte: I would label this as an adult version of mint chocolate ice cream due to the dominant flavor of the mint chocolate chip ice cream.",

We started off with a Smoked Mozzarella Fondue (cherry wood smoked pork butt, bread, pear) - this was so darn good, I'd come here just to order this! We also ordered the Egg Roll stuffed with Little Miss BBQ! I always wanted to try Little Miss BBQ, but I have yet to go there! I wasn't that impressed with it, seemed a little dry for my taste. For the main entree, I ordered the Shiitake Braised Short Ribs (roasted acorn squash, black kale, gorgonzola, pecans, fig-raisin relish). It had wonderful flavors and it was a huge portion. I took most of it to go because I filled up on the fondue! My friend had the Pan Seared Scallops (cola gastrique, bacon, sweet corn grits, pea greens). She said it was good, I had a bite and it was tasty...even the grits and I don't like grits!   I convinced myself that we were definitely having dessert! I ordered the Banana Creme Jar (vanilla pudding, banana, salted caramel, whipped cream, peanut butter cookies). It was delightful! I had to get an extra one to go and I am definitely looking forward to having a bite tomorrow!   I would love to try their brunch and I'm definitely coming back...especially when I discovered their patio is dog friendly!",

At first, our waiter was nice, but closer to the end of the meal, we felt really rushed.  He gave us our check and didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert.  I really wanted dessert, but because I felt like I was being shooed away, we decided to pay the bill and try to find dessert somewhere else.  I highly recommend the restaurant to anyone who is looking for a place to have a nice dinner with someone special.",

    "text": "If you're a single lady looking for a guy with a job, head to happy hour at The Gladly. On a recent Saturday night when I went there for dinner, there were dozens of good-looking guys who seemed to have it together - lots wearing suits, and many looking like they just came back from the country club.  Not that the eye candy is the only reason you should give The Gladly a try. It's a beautiful restaurant with good food and drinks, that's conducive to wiling away the night. Our two-and-a-half dinner and cocktail rendezvous went by in a breeze, and thankfully, we never felt pressure from the wait staff to hurry up. Lingering and enjoying every sip and savory moment is encouraged here.  It's no surprise the spot, like Blue Hound Kitchen in downtown Phoenix, is filled with chicness - it's in the Biltmore area, a stone's throw away from Senator John McCain's rumored penthouse mansion. The menu is definitely pricey, but I made a meal out of a salad and still left full. You could split some of the less expensive dishes and walk away satisfied, for sure.  I had a Farmer's Punch cocktail ($11), made with Absolut Pear vodka, Calvados brand, lemon juice, honey and quince syrup, Fee Brothers barrel-aged bitters, and lemon peel. It was really refreshing and a little sweet. It didn't taste overly alcohol-y, and I'd recommend it.  For appetizers, our table ordered the Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($10), with corn grits and truffle oil. Like the EVO salad I recently tried at EVO in Scottsdale, this dish will make anyone a Brussels sprouts believer. I liked them on top of the grits, which gave the dish a variety of textures and flavors. It was a really generous and filling portion, too.  My pal also got the Vietnamese Pepper Shrimp ($16), with tomato and a sticky rice cake. It looked and smelled great.  His fiancee got the Original Chopped Salad ($12), which I've already tried at Cowboy Ciao and Citizen Public House. She interestingly subbed the salmon for chicken, and the rest of it looked the exact same as I've had before. There's a reason this legendary salad is on several Valley menus - try it at least once to see what the hype is about. It even has its own Facebook page at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheoriginalchoppedsalad&s=7f5444feb9888a82a3ca15ec2ac7422dcb528db57226915f41d40f0c5860e3f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/theoriginal...</a>.  For my meal, I ordered the Burrata Caprese ($12), with Burrata mozzarella. I have to say, I'm not as big of a fan of Burrata as I am traditional mozzarella, simply because of the texture. Burrata is made with cream, so it's a much softer texture than traditional mozzarella. I did love the fresh basil and tomatoes, though, and the balsamic vinaigrette was delicious, too.  My pal also got the Honey Glazed Steelhead ($26), which seemed to be a generous portion.  We tried a tasty dessert, an apple tart topped with ice cream. It was more than enough to share with three people after that massive feast, and the tart was cooked to perfection. I'd say it's worth the splurge, for sure.  The main menu items range from $15-$36, with salads and appetizers up to $16. Head there for happy hour daily from 3-6 p.m. for half-priced beer and appetizers, and $5 glasses of wine. It's a fun place for people watching and gives Phoenix a New York City vibe (just like nearby bar Merc Bar, one of my favorites in the Valley for its cozy lighting and romantic atmosphere.)",

So when a friend asked us to pick a restaurant for restaurant week, we chose the gladly. A handsome, well-dressed man met us in the parking lot to tell us the lot was full and to go around the corner. We did, and entered through the back door, where a delightful, friendly woman welcomed us in. We had a table near the window where we started with a round of drinks. The IPA tap had just been killed and the waiter suggested ordering a lager instead, which we thought was strange. But he was very nice and delightful and the service was very good. We all had the three course restaurant week tasting. We all got the topped salad, which is wonderful. And at the table we had a duck meat loaf, scallops, and steelhead. They were all delicious.",

    "text": "Impressive ...the decor is warm and impressive. The food even more. They offer a selection of small plates, either as a appetizer or a main selection, Several salads, and of course entrees to choose from. On a recent dining adventure, we choose two small plates and well as a chopped salad. The chopped salad arrives in a neat arrangement of ingredients, which the waiter tosses table side with their house dressing. It included smoke salmon, Israeli Cous Cous, bacon and others items, and, was delicious. For the small plates, we choose the grilled Octopus, and the fresh Barolo with grill Italian bread. Both were outstanding! The Octopus tender and moist, grill to perfection. Served with grilled fingerling potatoes. The Barolo was creamy and fresh, with freshly grilled Italian bread. The food was perfection. The waiter friendly and most helpful in our selection. The offer a full bar with an extensive Whiskey and Wine list. If you have a cocktail do order the ice ball. It is an additional $3.00, which go to charity. They have a special devise to make the frozen ball table side, and worth it...the ice melts slowly,so it does not water down your drink. The restaurant is amazing, for the decor, service, and of course the food!",

    "text": "First I am surprised this restaurant is so highly recommend.  We had been wanting to try this place because of the good yelp reviews. We went for date night and we couldn't wait to leave.  It looks hip walking in but that's about it.  It was so loud we could hardly hear each other across the table.  He also had the sun in his for most of the meal and there weren't any shades.   We ordered the fondue app.  It was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I liked the bread with the cheese the most and let my Man eat the pig.  It came with a good amount for 2.  Could easily be split 3 ways.  I ordered the chopped salad based on the rave reviews.  The salad was good.  The presentation was cool how they bring it and then mix it but it wasn't amazing.  It was just good.  Man ordered the \"special\".  He asked the waitress if he should get the filet or the special which was the ribeye.  She told him the special for sure. He was a bit concerned b/c he likes filet better than ribeye but went with her recommendation.  The ribeye was huge but a lot of work for him cutting away the bad parts.  He said it was ok but wished he got the filet.  That was before the bill. He got the bill and looked super surprised.  The\"special\" ribeye was $46!!!  We kinda felt like we got screwed.  He said it was nowhere near worth that.  We didn't say anything but wished we would have.  Needless to say we wouldn't order the special again without asking the price.  If he wanted to buy a $50 steak we would have went to a steakhouse.   The drink menu looked good and big and the ice ball was neat.  I would maybe, maybe come back for HH and sit outside.  The patio looked relaxing.  Also yelp says casual dress but we would say it was more classy and business casual would be a more appropriate description.",

Burrata with fresh greens and tomatoes, a great next course. Pepper shrimp, delicious and cooked perfectly and for dinner, the most amazing scallops!!! And I'm a New Englander!!! So, the food is amazing! Next you have to ask for Tim the server, great in every step if the way! Nick the manager stopped by, talked with us like we have known him for years!! I love the Gladly. Not to mention, this is only our second of many visits to come! You're fools for not dining here. Enjoy!!",

Gladly service was excellent - top notch all around. Our cocktails were perfect. Our entrees - the ribs and the meatloaf - were good but not the most memorable aspects of our visit. Desert, I thought, was an afterthought at best.",

Our party of ten enjoyed the food...but the service, unlike some have stated was the worse for this restaurant and location. We had better service from bus boy.  After a couple of questions and recommendations to the house manager about our experience... it didn't seem like he cared very much that our experience in hosting our friend of NYC left a bad taste. Pun intended. I'd only give it another chance if I got a comp'ed meal and drink.  I think two-stars is still generous...but this is going out to the cook and bus boy!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for The Gladly but was a little disappointed.  I went there last week for Happy Hour to meet a girlfriend of mine.  I was greeted right away by the hostess and told her I was just going to have a seat at the bar.  The bar is a very large wrap around area and there were at least 3 or 4 bartenders.  I was again greeted right away by a bartender and received my glass of wine.  The wine list is very long but if you are a Chardonnay drinker, there are only 3 selections by the glass which I found to be a little disappointing.  My friend arrived and she received her glass of wine right away.  That is when all the service stopped.  She finished her glass first and finally got a second one upon asking.  When I finished mine, the bartenders walked by too many times to not ask if I'd like to have another.  It's not that they couldn't have seen that it was empty, especially when they are standing in front of you, talking to other guests or washing glasses and setting out clean ones.  I finally had to motion to get his attention and request another glass of wine.  We were planning on getting appetizers but were never given the opportunity to do this.  We had menus in front of us but they disappeared during our first glass of wine, never to appear again and we were never asked if we wanted anything to eat.    Now, I cannot comment on the quality of the food but all the food that everyone around us had looked great and the gentleman next to me said that his Pigstrami was fantastic.  Sadly, I didn't get a chance to even order anything.  After we were totally ignored we finished our glasses, leaving with amazement that were actually treated that way.  I may try them again because I like to give second chances and I'd like to try the food.   Hopefully this was a off night for all the bartenders behind the bar but I'm just not so sure.",

    "text": "First time at the restaurant for the NYE prix fixe menu. The food was outstanding and I will be back to explore more of the menu than what was available on this visit.  Atmosphere - It's not a quiet restaurant and the open concept adds to the noise level, but it has energy. The bar was packed which spilled over into restaurant area so it could be attributed to NYE.   Service - Great. Our waitress was attentive, a great personality and knew her menu. Her timing was excellent all night which was impressive considering how busy they were.   Food - There was no dish that we tired which fell short and one of the dishes was easily one of the best I've had in a long time. Chopped Salad - They call it the original chopped salad and it is very similar to another restaurant that I thought was the original. What was perfect on this salad was the portion, a perfect amount for the first course. Seared Spicy Tuna - This was a cold dish with great balance, it had some sweet, the citrus was bright and the shaved pepper made it easy to adjust the heat based on personal preference. Filet Mignon - A good cut that was cooked perfectly to my requested temperature. Accompanied by Yukon gold mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The bone marrow butter melting over the top gave the plate a richness. Seared Scallops - The highlight dish. Perfectly seared, with a little smoky flavor that were almost melt in your mouth. I've had a lot of seared scallops and this kitchen prepares them as well as any I've ever had. The sweet corn grits were smooth and tasty, a perfect combination. Deserts - The two offered on the prix fix left a little to be desired, but I'll assume it had to do with the volume they were doing that night. The regular menu desserts look very interesting and I'll go back to see if they are prepared with more creativity.  Great food & great service, I'll be back.",

I must admit the liver pate was definitely a wonderful surprise.  The food is great, the drinks are absolutely amazing and the service always top notch. My bartender (Will) from Citizen Public House told me to try it and I'm glad I did. I sat at the bar and DK took care of me. He's awesome. He even knew Will and made sure my first experience was excellent. That being said I can't wait to go back and try some other unique dishes. I would definitely recommend this place. Start with a chop salad, or a Manhattan or old fashion and save a little room for dessert. Follow that recipe and I guarantee you'll be back and never disappointed.",

This is a whiskey bar, so if you are a fan of whiskey this could be your place. I liked all the options and would have eaten dinner here as the menu had some great choices.

For my meal I did the short rib and it was fantastic. I loved the flavor and it was tender and not dry. I wish there were more greens but that was it.   And of course the bourbon selection is great.

Last week I decided to celebrate my birthday dinner and it truly was one of the best dinners and overall experiences! We started off with their famous chopped salad which is what they are very well known for, the buttermilk pesto was fresh and not too heavy, the chopped salad was perfect and the smoked salmon was not fishy or overbearing.  We then split the Brussels sprout appetizer with the salmon entree and once again it was delicious! Fresh salon, the Brussels sprouts were layered with grits, and I love grits, these were super tasty with smaller bits of corn, a mix between polenta and grits.  Since it was my birthday they offered me a birthday dessert, we chose the puff pastry with an amazing lemon curd with a layer of bread berries. The lemon curd was so fresh and light with that fluffiest puff pastry!!  I can't recommend this place enough and wish I took pictures, however since it was dinner the restaurant was a little dark with dim lighting. This only means I have to go back again:)",

It consisted of a fried green tomato that could not be cut, 1strip of bacon on a bun with shredded lettuce and tomato slices. It came with 4 roasted fingerling potatoes that were dry and tasteless. Wife had the seafood chowder. She said the broth was ok but everything inside was dry. Portion was small. Prices were high. I had a glass of iced tea. A 12 0z glass and was never offered a refill. Service was indifferent. Order taken, server came buy once to ask if we were ready for a check. A real disappointment.",

    "text": "Wow, we were incredibly surprised by The Gladly.  We'd read some mixed reviews but I still wanted to give it a try.  We got there at the right time, before happy hour ended and before the real crowds started showing up.  The food was fantastic.  The appetizers were HUGE.  VERY large portions all the way around.  We got the gorgeous roasted veggie plate and the salmon dinner, the smoked nuts, the pretzel and the brussel sprouts.  We had to take some of it home.  The real reason to come to the Gladly is the whisky and cocktails.  The whisky list is EXTENSIVE and the well drinks, well... they're not.  Amazing bourbon (four roses) as the \"well\" bourbon in your old fashioned.  I was simply floored.  One of the best cocktails I had in a while.  I think the thing about the Gladly is their interior looks a little generic and more like a Panera restaurant, which might throw some people's experience.  The menu is so spectacular, there's a bit of a disconnect in that regard.  We'll definitely come back.",

I'd made the reservation, so we were seated immediately. Very kind and professional staff, fairly classy ambiance and the food.. Oh the food..  So we ordered a couple cocktails (That One drink and Suntory Times highball) both were magnificent. After some of the best fondue we've ever eaten, She went with the salmon and I got the scallops. Both were rich and flavorful as hell. We didn't have room for dessert. We left a hearty tip with our payment and walked off quite satisfied. I'd recommend this place for special dates and slightly more upscale drinks with friends or colleagues~",

Our server, Jarrett, was wonderful- personable, patiently answered questions, and knowledgeable about dinner and drink options. We started with wines by the glass. My Sauvignon Blanc was delicious. I also ordered a few fresh oysters which Jarrett had described well beforehand. Hubby went with the seafood chowder that was very good. Creamy with nice chunks of yummy seafood. For our mains, he went with the famous chopped salad, and I ordered the short rib. He raved about his salad! It was a delicious combination of flavors and textures. My short rib was so tender and flavorful, and the cherry sauce complemented it so well. Loved the pea greens and parsnip puree alongside. Wonderful meal overall. Dine here and you will not be disappointed!",

It was very difficult to hear from across the table and the environment doesn't seem like one anyone should be yelling in. Our service was good, I sort of felt rushed with people continually coming by asking me if they could take my plate. Dude, it's not clean. BYE.   My biggest issue was the food. I ordered a field greens salad, which came with semi wilted, sad leaves. I'm a vegetarian, my choices are already limited, and this was disappointing as well as the TINY portion for a whopping $9.00. For a small plate of greens and 3 almonds. Seriously.   On to the Brussels sprouts. The dish is great, but the sprouts were charred on the outside and completely uncooked on the inside. Like, hard. I've eaten them many times, I'm aware they aren't to be overlooked. But this was carelessly prepared.   I'd come back for drinks, but I'd carry on down the street to St. Francis for better food.",

    "text": "I'll add my 5 stars to this place.  After some poor planning, I found myself on date night, looking for dinner without a reservation.  After calling one place down the street and being told we would wait 10 minutes, we showed up 5 minutes later to be told it would be an hour.  Time to improvise.  Walked into The Gladly at 6pm on a Friday night, through the back entrance and was greeted very pleasantly by a passing server.  No, we don't have a reservation, but that's no problem.    Honestly, the server that greeted us and the host that sat us, made us feel like they were expecting us.  Our server was the same one that greeted us, and he was excellent, patient, explained when we wanted an explanation, left us alone when we didn't, and knew when to do what simply by paying attention to us.  After being undecided on an appetizer, he reminded us about the chopped salad, which I had forgotten that I some day wanted to try it.    We had a couple of cocktails.  My wife enjoyed their Manhattan, and I tried the Apple of my Islay.  I love Islay scotch, but I've never imagined a mixed drink made with it.  This was very different, and was quite good.  Very smoky, with a sour lime flavor.  It's much better than I'm going to be able to describe in words, so be brave and try it!    So, the food was great, the chopped salad, my wife's scallops and my duck meatloaf all were excellent, and we left none of it behind.  Again, I'm not a food writer, so I don't know how to describe our dishes in a way that will be meaningful, so I'll leave it at that.  I thought the decor was great, sophisticated, but casual and comfortable.  I had no idea this was a major whiskey bar, but it is.  Largest selection I've seen, though if you haven't figured it out yet, my wife and I don't get out very often.  That's why I'm prompted to write a review.   For those that go to a restaurant like this once or twice a month, having a great experience (or a bad one) is one thing, but when you go to a place like this maybe twice a year, it's something else altogether.  This will be on my short list for those too rare of occasions when we can get away.    Thank you to The Gladly!",

We started off with their raw food bar menu served at the table, they are dabbling with this concept  of bringing to the table on slow nights.  We had amazingly fresh oysters and a raw scallops appetizer with pickled ginger and dill cucumbers.  Then we each had our own salad.  Both fresh and tasty, but the steak salad was beyond amazing with slightly seared filet mignon and delicious blue cheese dressing. We shared the gourmet Bernie Mac cheese that paired well the salads.  Finally dessert did not disappoint.  Chocolate cheesecake with pretzel crust and carmel sauce.  Yummy!  Plus service was great all around.",

We will enjoy outside dining at this venue when the weather is pleasant.  Do try the chopped salad it is out of this world.  The small-plate crab cakes were yummy too--a little zing but not too spicy.  Mostly adult place but kids appear to be welcome here and that is nice.  I would not say the place would be entertaining for kids but your kids noise will mix in well with the other dining sounds.  The menu is geared to adults but, they do have mac and cheese so kids should be happy. Very nice spot. If you are in the Biltmore area give it a try.",

Since it was a celebration we splurged and tried 3 appetizers, the chopped salad and 5 entrees to share family style. We all loved the hillbilly egg rolls, Brussel sprouts with grits, chopped salad and scallops the best. They have an amazing ice ball that is made at the table too that you must try with your favorite bourbon. Everything was wonderful though and we will defiantly recommend this place to others.",

We ordered the mac 'n cheese, which came with salsa on top. The flavors of the salsa were too overpowering for the cheese. My friend asked for his burger cooked medium and it came so under cooked the bun was bloody. Our server informed us that that is the way they cook them there. That's fine, but a little warning would have been useful. He returned the burger but was a little too disgusted to order something else. I ordered the yellow curry ramen and my first thought was that it tasted like Christmas. I'm not sure if it was Indian, Thai, or fruitcake inspired, but it was inedible. The overall opinion of my group was that the restaurant is trying to make their menu different but the flavor combinations don't quite work.",

Staying at the bar for Happy Hour was a nice way to enjoy all the goodies during Happy Hour.  The Happy Hour fare were well portioned and not skimpy plates.  The hibiscus drink was so good- not too sweet, just enough vodka and good for a second round.  We had a pretty good mix of different variety of foods, all of which were impeccably prepared, even down to the last green olive in the roasted vegetable platter.  I never eat pate, but decided to give the chicken spread a try which was a smooth combo with the homemade mustard, capers and bits of procuitto.  Who thought brussell sprouts on top of grits could taste that good?  They paid attention to how it the food was cooked, grilled or roasted, and the cooks brought out the natural flavor of each dish with minimal sauces and complimentary oil and spices to the highest level of attention.  This is on our list of places to return too.",

I came in for drinks tonight and sat at thier bar, ordered a cocktail from a really nice girl at the bar. After she made the drink which was great by the way all I could hear were the servers doing thier work and talking loudly behind a curtain. What I heard blew our minds. Some tall guy with grey hair was very loud and irritating and spewed nothing but racist and belittling comments toward his co workers. To make matters worse the manager was right there laughing with him! I couldn't believe the manager would tolerate and promote this kind of behavior. Its truly a shame because the place is beautiful, and the drinks are good but there's plenty of places I can go and not have to feel bad for people working there.",

The one thing that absolutely needs to be singled out was the chicken. Yes, that's right, the chicken. It came with a chimichurli sauce and was as good a chicken dish as I have ever eaten. Even the potatoes that came with it were spot on. Also had the brussel sprout appetizer which was just great (could have been a slightly larger portion). Also, those cocktails were on a whole different level than other places. We will be back again soon and thank you once again Brian!!",

The shrimp po boy and the chicken liver pate were each two of the best things I've eaten in a long time and may be in my top ten ever. The late night menu items are reasonable priced around $10 but there's no sacrifice in food quality or size . If you want something amazing past midnight this is the place to go. Not to mention the bartenders are all friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. Also the late night menu changes every week so it's always something new . You could tell that a lot of experience and planning went into each dish. This place is a must try.",

We went during HH so I could try as many things as possible because that's my favorite way to eat, lots of small plates.  I started with Super Yummy Nuts and the title doesn't lie, I could not stop eating them, they were crazy good, a little sweet, a little smoky and a little salty.  I then had the  Roasted Brussel Sprouts because they are my current favorite vegetables! They were cooked perfectly and so were the grits. I'm always a bit apprehensive about grits but these were creamy and very flavorful. Then to round things out I had smoked chicken wings and they were fantastic, I love smoked wings and these were amazing. Perfectly crispy skin with moist meat, perfect pairing.  My friend ordered the French Onion Waygu Burger which was amazing, definitely a must try for burger fans! But hands down the best thing we had was Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese, we're still talking about it and when we're going to come back and have it again. The pasta is cooked perfectly, it's not that mush that you get sometimes when you order mac 'n cheese. The flavors are more then just the smoked mozzarella and tomotoes that are listed. It's incredibly creamy and rich. If there is 1 thing that you have to order when you go, it's definitely Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese.  I don't remember the happy hour cocktail for that day, it was whiskey based with fruit and bitters, I just tried a sip and it was pretty good, I love the fact that they have different specialty cocktails based on the seasons.  The service was phenemonal on all ends, everyone was really friendly, it was the perfect ending to my birthday month.",

The chef, formerly at Cowboy Chow has his signature chopped salad on the menu, and when it came time to ordering our waiter gave us one on the house- it was divine!!! We had the scallops which were rich but delectable, and grits... also very rich but very good. We started out with a drink called Conflagration Nation. Not sure if this masterpiece is still on the cocktail menu, but it consisted of bourbon, whiskey, and some other ingredients, one of which was a sweet cigar smoke, infused somehow in the drink. Served over a hand made large ice cube, I sipped on this for an hourly, getting happily buzzed. Try this place out during sunset, on the patio when the weather is nice... it's a great place for a date!",

    "text": "Went to this place cause my sister wanted more chopped salad.  We had just been to Citizen Public House and she was craving more chopped salad.  We had the Brussels sprouts, sausage and pretzel, chopped salad and scallop entree.  Everything was tasty and good.  However we enjoyed the Citizen Public House chopped salad more than the one at The Gladly.  There was more salmon and dressing on the one at CPH.  I would be back because the Brussels sprouts had creamy grits paired well with it along with the cheese.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and also had creamy delicious grits.    I would be back but if you're craving chopped salad, go to CPH.",

    "text": "I have driven past The Gladly many times and been meaning to visit.  I love the atmosphere and the service. I had the Chicken Liver Pate as an appetizer and the Buttermooink Burger. Both were excellent, however I have to go into some detail on the Chicken Liver Pate.  First of all, I love the presentation, small jar of pate with a side of pickled red onions and a flavorful whole grain mustard. This was served with rye melba toast (little rounds of toast, about 1/8 inch thick).  JUST A WORD ABOUT THE TOAST:  I have never eaten any melba toast this hard before in my life. Rock hard. Biting into the toast (gently) it shattered, driving shards into my cheeks and gums. It was like eating hard plaster. Like practical joke hard. If the pate wasn't so darn delicious I would have been sensible and stopped eating after the first mouthful, but no. I polished this off. The whole plateful.  That melba toast was so hard and so sharp that for the next three days the side of my mouth was just scraped the Hell up. A shard of that toast jammed up into my gums and caused a gum infection. I knew something was jammed up in there, because when I went to floss, the floss shredded and broke.  I ended up going to the dentist to get this checked out and sure enough I had something jammed way up in there. Fortunately, it didn't break my tooth. Now for the next week I have to take an antibiotic mouth rinse to let this heal up. The $6 Chicken Pate (from the Happy Hour menu) ended up costing an additional $130 in dentist fees.  So I would implore The Gladly - please - do something about this melba toast. Really I love the place and will return, but I would never order the Chicken Pate again, which is a shame because it really was delicious.",

Just to give you an idea, we had a churro waffle with a chile chocolate sauce on top. DELICIOUS!  The place is a bit pricey, but it's worth it.   To make it perfect, I would just add a bigger selection on the menu.",

    "text": "Right away I did not care for The Gladly. I made reservations during restaurant week to ensure a spot for our first visit. When we arrived they seated us at the worst possible table right near the entrance breezeway amidst all the door traffic. I thought reservations got priority seating. Since the table was so easily overlooked ..It took forever for a server to arrive and take our drink order.   Thank goodness our server did rise to the occasion. We switched tables and he placed our food orders very quickly. I will say -  the scallops were to die for and the sweet corn grits were superb! High five on that one, Gladly :-) Now everything else just wasn't that great.   Had the inventive cauliflower salad to start.  Not good at all. Bland as bland can be and reeked terribly of .. well.. something that it shouldn't. And my guest's bisque soup was more of a chunky mashed puree. We both ordered peach cobbler for dessert and the grainy texture wasn't too bad. But the sweet cream didn't hit the spot and the dish overall needed perhaps some cinnamon or some ice cream with vanilla bean to draw out flavor.   I have to add that it took an awkward gap of several minutes (millenia!)  between each course to bring in the next dish.  Thanks to my glass of wine and the server who really did the best he could, the meal wasn't a complete disaster. Still - it was not a good first impression from the seating, to the flow of the meal, to the meh-tasting food.",

We got appetizers only for the evening and we enjoyed every bite of it. The CHARCUTERIE BOARD is a must and we also loved GOCHUJANG CRISPY ROCK SHRIMP.   Our server which I didn't catch her name was very nice, very informed about the menus and she suggested the THE ORIGINAL CHOPPED SALAD and I'd like to thank her for making that suggestion, and it competed out meal. We also had one of the specials and that was the Gumbo with Grits, I really enjoyed it but Mom was not a fan, Dad was ok with it.   At the end we were presented with 3 flute of champagne and deserts complements of the restaurant and that was a beautiful finale to a great evening.   Definitely coming back!  Thanks",

You do it because it is the healthier choice or you may be in need of some greens. (Or.... maybe that's just me?)   The Gladly is the only place on earth where when I order the chopped salad, I do not feel like I am sacrificing by going with a salad.  The chopped salad is actually THAT good! I tried to replicate it at home, came close but nothing compares.   The service is okay, not stellar, which is what brought this down to a 4.

    "text": "Everytime someone asks me for a restaurant recommendation, my first recommendation is always The Gladly. The Gladly doesn't just exceed in ambiance and service, it exceeds in food and drinks. I've been dining here for a few years now, and The Gladly is still in my opinion one of the best restaurants in the valley.   We always start off our meal with The Original Chopped Salad. It is honestly the best salad I have ever had.  It's literally heaven in your mouth. It contains couscous, smoked salmon, arugula, dried corn and other ingredients - all of this mixed together is PHENOMENAL. With that being said, if you are not a fan of smoked salmon, I would maybe order this without the salmon. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this salad is.  As far as the appetizers, I always order the chicken liver pate. I am not usually a fan of chicken liver but they do it so well here. You can't go wrong with the roasted brussel sprouts and the kimchi chicken wings as well and you can find all three of these dishes on their happy hour menu (everyday from 3-6 pm).   For the main dishes, I usually order the pan seared scallops which are amazing (you might be underwhelmed, it doesn't come in a huge serving), duck meatloaf (my best friend swears by this dish too), and the salmon. My boyfriend absolutely loves their burger too.   If you haven't tried the Gladly, you need to go ASAP. FYI: They're part of restaurant week and it's only $33 a person which is WORTH IT. The chopped salad is part of the menu so that's enough reason to come in.",

    "text": "Nom! Came here for lunch and thought it was a great experience.  I ordered the Fish Tacos with side salad and everyone else ordered the Chopped Salad.  The salad was a big hit with everyone and looked so fresh and healthy.  The fish tacos were delicious and stuff with a LOT of fish, avocado, cabbage slaw, and some other stuff.  The bites where I got some of the cabbage slaw were my favorite.  It was tasty and filling, can't ask for much more.  I only wish the side salad had been a little bigger.  Mine came with only like 10 pieces of lettuce and when I saw my dining companion got a side of fries that was much more substantial, I was sad I hadn't ordered the fries.  Overall, really enjoyed the experience and the atmosphere.  It was so easy to hear everyone at the table and the restaurant was nice and bright from all the big windows.  I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Despite the resounding recommendations for the table side tossed, famed chopped salad, I opted for the Field Greens. The chopped salad I learned has couscous & barley. Two carby items I don't eat so rather than ask for them to be withheld I went with the field greens.   It was fantastic and different. Featuring marinated dates, manchego cheese & almonds, the flavor was very original with a good variety of textures. The dressing was very thin and mild which I liked. I ordered chicken on top and although it was cubed ( I find that unappealing) it was quite good.  It's a neat spot. The outdoor patio looked inviting in cooler weather I've heard their whisky list is 40 pages so it's on my list of spots to take my husband. I liked this space. It feels spacious with the high ceilings but isn't overly loud and the table side tossed salad is an experience.",

The actual location isn't super--although we did walk there from the bar at Del Frisco's-  it feels a little like you're in a corporate-y building, but once you walk into the restaurant you forget about all that.   Our server, Aaron, was awesome! Really friendly and gave us guidance when we asked for it. We had the pork belly starter which was delicious and way less fatty than some I've had before. We then had the chopped salad. I get it-- the salad has a facebook page its so famous, but I didn't think it would be worth talking about. I mean, it's a salad. Well it proved me wrong. To die for. So good. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm drawn in to The Gladly for lunch to have that bad boy.  For entrees-- we tried the tuna, chicken and short ribs. All of which had interesting spices and flavor profiles-- all memorable. The short ribs were out of this world. As was the brussel sprout side dish.  Drinks- about half of our bill was on drinks, but that's likely because we splurged on a nice bottle of red with our meal, which Aaron helped us decide on. My mom and I had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc during our apps/salad and the hubs had a spicy marg which was really good.   Can't wait to go back. Definitely a repeat kinda place.",

Duck meatloaf was a bit gamey and pretty heavy. The scallops and rockfish special, though, were on point! Service was so-so. We asked our busboy for a lot of things and he happily helped us out. Don't know what happened to our actual waiter throughout the meal.  Clientele seemed a little stuffy, but this is the Biltmore area so I shouldn't be surprised. I'd maybe come by for happy hour, but not full dinner service.",

We walked in through the backside of the building and it was reminiscent of the scene of Ray Liotta in \"GoodFellas\".  From the minute we walked in, I was wowed.  They took over the former home of an American Steakhouse institution and nailed the renovation giving it the just right amount of hip, cool and classic design to suit the bones of the building.  Here is where it gets even cooler; the place nails it.  Attractive, approachable crowd with barkeeps who pride themselves in living up to their self-imposed standards.  I happened to be wearing a shirt that had \"Sazerac\" on it so I had no choice to try their spin on this classic cocktail.  They did not disappoint, the dude made it with precision and pride.  We ended up talking about their desire to bring back those golden oldies where not only does it taste good, it goes down smooth.    I was so impressed by the cocktail that I did forego any of the eats and that is the only reason I only gave it 4 outta 5 stars, but it just gives me something to look forward to on my next swing through Phoenix.  Great work people.  P.S.  I can't believe I even forgot the best part.  The music was delicious.  As a former professional DJ for over 20 years, I found myself using my Soundhound app on several occasions.",

Will definitely be going back soon.",

We sat outside and it was nicely lit and the weather was perfect surprisingly for a May night. The original chop salad is amazing, one of my favorite salads in the whole wide world. Also, I tried the sea bass entree, was cooked well done but I'm not sure if it's ever as buttery Chilean Sea Bass, which is my favorite fish. I would definitely come back to try more items.",

The brussel sprouts and grits is amazing and I will often substitute it for the bacon as a side dish just so I can have some more after the appetizer portion. Be sure to dress professionally as it is part of an office building and while they will tell you it's casual on weekends, you will feel underdressed if you're not in a collared shirt (or equivalent)",

    "text": "This may be my new favorite restaurant. I had dinner with my family on Friday night and it was amazing from beginning to end. We totally pigged out so here's the rundown on each dish:  Chicken Liver Pate:  They make it with pistachios so it's a light flavor than regular pate. Very tasty.  Fondue:  This was one of my favorite items. Rich, gooey cheese served with pork, bread, and pears. Each item paired perfectly with the cheese and the pork was excellent.  Chopped Salad:  Like everyone says, this salad is amazing. Seriously one of the best (if not the best) salads I've ever eaten. If you order only one thing, make it this.  Hillbilly Egg Roll:  Made with meat from Little Miss BBQ. Ours was made with the brisket. I've had Little Miss many times (it's fantastic) so the eggroll was just okay for me. The meat is pretty greasy as is so to add the greasy egg roll shell was a little too much. Honestly, I like Bobby Q's version of this better. Plus, I thought it was kind of overpriced - $12 for ONE eggroll? Really?  Macaroni and Cheese: Not a classic mac 'n' cheese but it's good. They use the same cheese as the fondue so it's ooey gooey.  Good but not my favorite dish of the night.  Scallops and Grits:  Totally awesome. The scallops were cooked just right and the grits with the balsamic were delicious. They should have those grits by themselves as a side dish because they are excellent.  Chess Pie:  This was better than I thought it would be. Chocolately but not fudgy and the ice cream on top paired well with it.  Banana Pudding:  This was SOOOO good. Yumminess in a jar. Banana pudding with big chunks of banana, caramel, whipped cream, a cookie on the side. OMG.  The atmosphere was nice, although it did get pretty loud once the restaurant was full. Our server was great too. Very attentive and fun without being overbearing. And if you like whisky, they have an extensive whisky menu.  Get yourself to The Gladly! You'll be gladly that you did.",

My current favorite is the Wagyu Beef Burger or the Duck Meatloaf, but I've never had a bad dish here. A more of an industrial setting, given its location, but they really make you forget you're practically inside another office building, and they have a couple of secluded dining spaces for larger parties. Great place for a business meeting, or a casual dinner, with an impressive bar and a friendly staff.",

We have an on-going love affair with The Citizen Public house, so it was absolutely relieving to find ourselves in a restaurant with just the same pride in ambiance, decor, food and service!  We of course enjoyed our regular Original Chopped Salad (made famous by CPH) but strayed from the regulars through the rest of the meal.  Our server was passionate about the cocktails and gave mouth watering descriptions of the menu options...which of course were spot on!    The location in central phoenix is, 'different' as I would call it.  Located in a business park on Camelback, it is still easy to find and even easier to give directions to others to meet you there!  Enjoy with friends and family any night of the week !",

Wasn't digging the dark, large shoe box, no windows area, but what-evs. We had our own bar in there so that was sorta pimp.  I chose their Spicy Bloody Mary. Dude. They make their OWN tomato-based mix. I saw in their stew pot!! The time and care paid off, bc their Mary was phenomenal!  Since its Chopped Salad has its own Facebook page, I had to order one to see for myself. I must say, I was disappointed when the rainbow-colored ingredients came on a smaller plate. I thought, \"This isn't it, is it?\". I bitched to my friend. I mixed and poured. My attitude came to a screeching halt and did a 180. HOLY Sheyat! So effing tasty!! I'm hooked. For life.  The owner/GM gave us free salad cards to use in the future too! I almost peed a little.  I'll be back for sure.",

The rib eye special came with two corn on the cob and side of spicy potato salad which was really good.. The only thing I probably have to take a half a star off is that their soft drink selection is very limited and it comes in a small glass coke bottles which is $2 a piece.. It's not expensive but it does add up if you want more soda.. Other than that we all enjoyed this place.. Last thing, I believe they only take up to 4 cards so if you come with a group bring cash and also they don't do the automatic gratuity if U have 6 or more which I think is great..",

The bacon.. OMG - probably one of the best sides of bacon I have ever ordered.  Yum!  I ordered the Chilaquiles.  Thats where this is tough - over salted - WAY over salted.  Had I been alone or just the two of us, I would have sent it back.  But someone else selected the location, had a connection with the place, and was paying for my meal.  I didn't want to make a scene with everyone and wait for another dish, so I plugged through it.  Sad - it had so much potential!  It may have been a one time thing - two others ordered the same thing but nobody complained - so either I'm more sensitive - or - mine was over seasoned.  I'd rather be short on salt and add - than over salted.  Anyway - don't let this detract you - folks seemed to enjoy.  I'll give them a second chance.  But just one more.",

Just wish they would open a restaurant that serves this salad in North Scottsdale! The Brussel sprout appetizer and scallops entree look incredible. Great location for outdoor dining or business meeting. Also have a small room for special events.",

    "text": "The Gladly is yet another perfect restaurant operated by the In Good Spirits gang. Though there is no shortage of amazing restaurants in Arcadia, we always find ourselves at the Gladly for special occasions. One of the main reasons is that they have a super impressive cocktail and whiskey selection, with tableside-formed ice spheres that are so clear and perfect I could shed a tear. As I mentioned in my CPH review, Bernie's infamous chopped salad - smoked salmon, pepitas, freeze dried corn, Israeli couscous, bruschetta and arugula - is a thing of beauty and deserves its own Facebook page and thousands of followers. Oh wait, it already has one. It's THAT amazing.   On a more recent visit we had the burrata - two generous heaps of melt in your mouth creamy goodness served with slightly smoky grilled country bread. Simple but perfect. The charcuterie board was pretty standard, good but nothing to write home about. The Gladly also usually participates in AZ Restaurant week, which is my favorite time to visit. Mostly because everyone is forced to order their own chopped salad and I don't have to feel guilty about not sharing. They also have a lot of excellent gluten free options on the menu, for those of you with actual gluten intolerance or if you just hate happiness. I kid, I kid, but seriously... bread is amazing. I came recently for my birthday and was surprised with a giant scoop of funfetti ice cream and a custom Gladly cookie on the house! They definitely get an A+ in my book!",

I had to come back here and have it again. Trust me, you will not be disappointed should you choose to try it. Customer service was awesome, water filled consistently, and server came around often. Went on a Friday night so there were plenty of patrons around, but man was it loud. I personally felt like I couldn't hear conversations with my date. Also, it got pretty warm in there. My date commented on how warm it was getting and the group of girls next to our table were all fanning themselves with their table napkins lol. It may have been a bad spot where we sat since we were in the corner of the restaurant. Nonetheless, really nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Great experience and amazing salad lol.",

Gladly was able to take my most hated meal (meatloaf) and turn it into something I would fly back to have. It might be made from duck but was delicious.   Let start with drinks. I tried the Holy Water (a take on an old fashion) with an ice ball making demonstration. The waiter explained how everything worked manually, while our party watched an air bubble free ice square turned into a perfect sphere.   Appetizers were the only thing holding me back from handing out the 5th star. The fondue was bland, lacking any additional flavor from the bites to dip. We also tried the roasted brussel sprouts, but the cheesy grits over took the meal and cheese was all you tasted. I wanted to dip my fondue bites into the grits! Make that happen Gladly.   The Duck Meatloaf was a life changer. Everything in the meal worked cohesively to make that dish one of the best I've had in awhile. I was able to try the Chopped Salad as well, enjoyable but not what I was after that evening.   Worth the money.",

The service was phenomenal, the food was mind blowing, and the atmosphere was lovely.   We arrived on a Saturday night around 7:30PM and we're seated immediately without a reservation. Our server was Tim and he was absolutely amazing. When I think about all of my dining experience, he might just be one of the nicest and most genuinely charismatic servers that I've ever had.  Now let's talk about the food! I can't summon words adequate enough to describe the heavenly taste and feeling in my mouth. We split the Fondue, 4 Duxbury Oysters, I had the Scallops, and the boyfriend had the duck meatloaf. We finished the meal with the wonderful buttermilk Bread Pudding.  This was an incredible dinner and a fantastic date night option, that left my boyfriend and I very satisfied. Chef Bernie Kantak is a genius! Do yourself a favor and go there for a meal as soon as humanly possible.  I will definitely be returning to The Gladly.",

My favorite server is Kat.  Not only is she incredibly knowledgeable about the food and drink list, but she is witty, fun and makes you feel like you are all enjoying this amazing meal together.  Pair her with with the assistant manager, Lex, and you have an incredible team.  Lex is so passionate about everything The Gladly, that he could tell you every detail about how dishes are prepared, why they are done that way, how they created the new cocktail of the day....his passion is astounding. It makes you excited to see them and to hear about all the new things that have added to the menu.  And for the food and drinks, you honestly cannot go wrong in any direction.  For food, I personally love the octopus small plate (and I'm not even that big of an octo fan, but the way they prepare it is fantastic!), roasted root vegetables, the short ribs, and the tender belly pork chop.  And for drinks, hands down it's the Pan Am Sour.  I am a HUUUUUGGGE pisco sour fan (which is hard to find in the Valley) and this drink scoops up all my love for that cocktail with a twist.  It's even adorned with the signature Gladly \"G\" made of sprayed bitters in the middle.  It's amazing.  If there is one restaurant in the Valley that I can go to again and again for consistently amazing service and food, it is The Gladly. :) Cheers!!",

Made reservations for a Friday night for my boyfriend's birthday and the staff all remembered and wished it to him on our way in and out, even brought him a cookie at the end with a candle. We had the fondue as an app and it was very good...who doesn't like melted cheese? For dinner we both ordered the duck meatloaf and it was out of this world. We were too full to try any desserts but the cocktails were good as well. My boyfriend said there are only a handful of outstanding meals he remembers throughout the years and this was one of them. Thank you for a great dining experience and for making me look good for my choice in restaurants ;)",

I had a few olives and some cheese, but we had to go out to dinner right after the party.  A little bit annoying since I assume this wasn't the cheapest place to have a party.

I had the tuna app. Not great, but not bad. Will try something else next time. Gladly has a huge single malt scotch list. If you're into it, it's cool how they bring out this machine that makes the big pure ice ball. Nice atmosphere and nothing felt really overpriced. The bill $110, with 4 scotches.

I went with some friends from work for lunch and I was quite surprised at how they changed up the place from the old Ruth Chris building.  You are able to walk in with jeans and a tshirt and you don't feel out of place.    I ordered the wagyu burger and fries.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare and on a fresh baked potato bun with some arugula and grilled onions.  The burger itself you can tell is flavored so it's not just a plain beef patty leaving you to get all the burger flavor from it's toppings.  Super juicy and probably one of the better burgers I've had in a good while.  The fries were great and had a nice salt and pepper coating to go with the home made ketchup.     Some of the menu items can be pricy but the burger with fries was 12 bucks and you pay more than that at zinburger.  Great place and highly recommend to give them a try",

When I had friends in town we decided that we would take them here for our after church brunch.  We were seated outside on the great patio and our server was kind and took great care of us.  Having a toddler with us, that was really hungry to the point of hangry (hungry/angry, he got this behavior from me), we need to order something for him immediately.  They made him fresh pineapple juice and then we proceeded to ask for random items that he wanted: 2 orders of bacon, half an avocado and two pieces of toast with no butter.  She brought it out quickly and he was one happy distracted child for the rest of the meal.  The adults ordered the following: Protein Plate, Pigstrami Hash and 2 orders of Eggs Berniedict.  I will state for the record that it was difficult for me to resist ordering the Chopped Salad but I decided I should stick with the brunch theme.  The protein plate had a large piece of chicken breast, yogurt, Korean pears, grapes, almond butter and flax granola.  It was devoured by the pregnant lady and she was skeptical at first but so delighted with the plate and full.  I ordered the Pigstrami hash, smoke pork butt with potatoes, onion, kale, eggs and lepinja.  Flavorful and cooked to perfection but it wasn't the Eggs Berniedict and I ended up stealing that from my husband.  Eggs Berniedict had eggs, pretzel roll, smoked sausage, cheese fondue and some fruit on the side, there was no contest for me, this was the dish to order.",

Once we were seated we ate the original chopped salad (4.5 stars), the scallops (4.5 stars), the duck meatloaf (4 stars), and the chocolate tart (4 stars). Everything was amazing! And for only $33 a person it was a steal!   The only thing I wish we had done was get an ice sphere made for the whiskey. I thought it would just be a pre made sphere but the table next to us got one and they actually made it table side from a cube of ice.

We had the scallops and the mushroom omelette. Their mimosas are very unique because they use a sorbet with prosecco. It was the best mimosa I've had in my life and borderline orgasmic. My friend got a spicy bloody Mary. We had a great conversation and entertaining dining experience before heading out to the Cardinals game. Thank you so much.",

The interior of the restaurant is your 'phone it in' modern crap.  This grey shit has got to stop!  Wendy's and McDonald's are going all grey too...how exciting( not)  If you're in the neighborhood I guess the bar is okay.

    "text": "I never heard of The Gladly, but got introduced to it on Sunday June 14, 2015 by attending a ladies-only dining MeetUp.  This was their very first Meet and Greet MeetUp, which was supposed to be at FEZ, but apparently FEZ turned down a party of 8 (comment found in a 1 star Yelp review) because they could not seat \"large parties\".  FEZ was not responsive when our organizer called them to ask about our large party of 20 people, so she moved our first event to The Gladly, which she said was excited to accommodate us.    The Gladly gave us our own private tables in their upper level.  We went there at 1 pm on Sunday.  Our food was excellent, says everyone, but I did not taste any one's food.  I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu, filet mignon.  They delivered it the way I wanted, red on the inside, on top of the same asparagus and mashed potatoes that the duck meatloaf is served on.  I would give the filet a 4, nothing extraordinary, but still tasty.  Our server was very attentive, nothing was lacking.  I was impressed she even took from my table, the (used) backing from nametags, to throw away.  They had a separate water pourer, even tho the bottled water was already on the table, and we could pour ourselves, the staff kept pouring our water for us.  The management was so accommodating, that they gave the group a free $50 gift card, which the organizer had tickets for a drawing for.   Management also gave each diner a card for a free chopped salad.  I mean, no additional or minimum purchase required kind of free.    So today, June 16, 2015, I had an errand on the same block as The Gladly, and went in at 6 pm to get my free chopped salad.   My awesome and cheerful server, Caleb, asked if I would like him to mix the dressing into the salad and toss it for me.   I wish I had a camera, the layout and presentation was so beautiful, but I see many photos of the chopped salad in these reviews.  I asked what each layer was.  The corn kernels looked all freezer burnt to me, but Caleb explained they were freeze dried for crispiness.    The salad was delightful, and the freeze dried corn kernels really added crispy crunch contrast with the chewy currants and pepitas.  The smoked salmon was REALLY SMOKEY, and made the whole salad taste smoked.    I also ordered, because Caleb convinced me it was his favorite, the Madras Curry Pork Belly $13, with thinly sliced Persian pickled cucumbers, coconut broth, pea tendrils, chile oil, cashews (I asked for the nuts to be on the side).  The pan-fried pork belly meat was a bit dry, but it was topped with the fat of the pork belly, which was SOOOO good!   I LOVE FAT!  It tasted like bone marrow, so soft and deliciously flavoring the meat.   I wish I had more of the coconut broth and chile oil to mash the drier meat into.  Pea tendrils and pickled cucumber slices really complimented the meat.  I like dishes of different textures.  I complimented Caleb on his choice for me, because I WAS going to order the lamb riblets for $16, but when I asked Caleb to describe what there was to eat, he told me there are only 4 riblets with nothing much on them to eat.  Tho I love lamb, I do not want to pay $4 per small riblet, and only get 4 of them, when I could order a whole dinner at another restaurant for $16.  My dinner today is 5 stars, service 5 stars.  Caleb was an awesome server, cheerful and upbeat.   My filet mignon previous Sunday is a 4 star, service 5 stars, so I am still give them 5 stars.     I felt the atmosphere of the restaurant was quite noisy at 6 pm, everyone was chatting with someone else, but me, who had come alone.  But I will come back here to have the reduced price happy hour food with my girlfriends before 6 pm, as the different servers told me the portion for the items on happy hour menu, is the same size as on the dinner menu.    I am a picky and discriminating Foodie, and I tell you, not many restaurants will get a 5 star, from ME !!!  I may organize a Wild Dining MeetUp at the Gladly, in the future, maybe on a Sunday for dinner, when they have happy hour all day.",

    "text": "A welcomed 360 experience, the Gladly staff, owners & chefs should be basking in the afterglow of a successful grand opening last night. Not having made reservations, my date and I were still warmly received and quickly accommodated by the hostess, even though, upon first entry, it appeared evident that chancing this could have upset their well-prepared flow of anticipated patrons.   Our waiter, Tim, showed genuine interest in our overall dining experience - taking the time on a busy grand opening night to give detailed & enticing recommendations, politely \"interrupting\" our conversations to \"check in\" (impeccable timing - ha!), and stepping in to make sure our smoked salmon salad was mixed \"just so\" - he alone would be a good reason to return.   Now, getting down to the purpose of our visit: sustenance. All plate presentations were nicely done. Our first course, the smoked salmon salad, turned out to be the highlight for me - a featured dish not listed on the menu, I can only hope to enjoy it again one day. It was a textured, colorful party for my taste buds (perhaps Tim's expert salad-tossing skills played a role in this? - ha!). The lamb riblets, chilled isot chile tuna & coffee charred short ribs were all unique blends of herbs & marinades, prepared near perfection. But I must say, the refreshing Moe'scow Mule (American Harvest organic spirit, Fever-Tree ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) proved to be the perfect compliment. This beverage alone may just be the key ingredient for a future happy hour.   Well done, Gladly staff, management & owners. I wish you much success.",

Each of us ordered different specialty drinks of theirs and watched in amazement as the bartender created these master pieces in front of us. Not only were they beautifully made drinks but they tasted so good!   One of their employees, David, recommended their Chopped Salad. I was a bit skeptical when the description of it was just a Facebook link so I ordered it anyways and holy smokes I'm so happy I ordered that. It was, without a doubt, the best salad I've ever had. David was a fantastic person to speak with, he gave us many other wonderful recommendations.  The next time I'm in Scottsdale the first place I'm going to is The Gladly!",

    "text": "The Gladly doesn't officially open until this Saturday but they had a preview night for people (like myself) who work in the area.  Taking over in the spot that Ruth Chris used to occupy, I am looking forward to eating there often.    Of the small plates that they were serving, my favorites were the scallops and the duck.  Both were fantastic.  The one dish that I wasn't able to sample because it was grabbed almost as soon as it came out of the kitchen was the meatloaf.  Everyone that I talked to that tried it said it was the best dish that they tasted.  I also had the tuna and the chicken pate.  Both were good, but not great.    As for the drinks, I really enjoyed the Thai Margarita but once I tried their Manhattan, I was hooked.  It was by far the best Manhattan that I have ever had.  I also sampled the Salute, a gin and grapefruit drink, but didn't really care for it.  They had a number of other cocktails on the menu that they weren't serving that looked very good and I can't wait to go back and try a few.  Lastly, the service was just as good, if not better, than the food or the drinks.  The staff was very friendly and even though it was the first time I had ever been there, or anyone for that matter, I left feeling like a regular.  I can't wait for the official opening so that I can come back and try the meatloaf and some of the other cocktails on the menu.  Seeing as how I work next door, I have a feeling that this is going to be my new go to spot after work!",

I'd heard good things about this place and just wanted a chill place to enjoy some good, hand-crafted cocktails. I was not disappointed.  The guys working the bar are exactly what I expect from an upper-range establishment: they can chat you up with some witty conversation, they know their product well, and True mixologists, they can throw together something exactly to your liking if nothing on the menu suits you.  Their cocktails are perfectly balanced and they are not \"foo-foo\" cocktails either because after two, I knew I needed to move a little closer to home. The place is dimly lit and sexy with good music. They have a late night menu, so I'm thinking a nightcap is on the agenda soon.  I am very happy that these guys are nearby and highly recommend. I will update my review when I've sampled the menu. But in the mean, well done on the drinks.",

We both decided to start with The Original Chopped Salad (same as Cowboy Ciao), how can you go wrong with this salad!? AMAZING. Then he had the Buttermilk Chicken Breast and I had the Pan Seared Scallops. The chicken had such great strong flavors that worked really well with each other and the scallops were the best I've ever eaten! The desserts they had to choose from were the Peach Cornmeal Cobbler and the Buttermilk Bread Pudding. Since there were two to choose from and two of us this was a no brainer and do one of each and share. Both were very good, but I did enjoy the Buttermilk Bread Pudding a tad more.   I highly suggest stopping in and doing a dinner date night!",

Also enjoyed the chicken pate. Note- the shrimp was good but is large enough to be an entree.   Best entree - chilled tuna (perfection) with jicama and pineapple. Coffee crusted shortribs are yum but a small warning, they are seriously rich. The scallops showcased from sister restaurant Citizen are just as delicious both places.   Our drinks were all delicious. Recommend the Thai margarita, the manhattan and the house draft negroni.   Just the be balanced we should mention 2 things. 1- the noise level is extreme and we had to yell just to hear people at our own table. 2- we called to say we would be 10 minutes late and they said they had our table booked again 75 minutes after our reservation. I don't think so! I promptly told them there was no way we would be done that quickly and weren't in the mood to be rushed. Needless to say, once we were there we weren't rushed and the service was excellent.   We will go again and next time save room for dessert! Ice cream cones I read about in other reviews sound delightful and creative. The menu doesn't really say- just says ice cream cone. Next time I'm in!",

Don't get the olives, tomato soup, mixed nuts, etc. Maybe it needs a little more time to get the kitchen up to par but this was no where near as good as citizen public house and I hear they are the same owners.",

And the food is always superb. I do however have a sole purpose for writing this review... A message to the lovely chef - DEAR CHEF DE GLADLY, please bring back the dearly beloved Banana Creme Jar, please. Not the version with toffee or whatever addition that was - I'm talking about the OG Banana Jar layered with the salted caramel and the peanut butter cookie crumbles on top. To me, this was a holy grail item, like the chopped salad. You wouldn't take the chopped salad off the menu, would you?  I've mentioned it to my servers before and they always say that I'm not the first person and that they'll pass my message along to the chef. I still ask every time I go, holding on to hope. But to no avail, the dessert menu continues to lack this gem. I haven't ordered dessert from The Gladly since.   If you won't put it back on the menu, would you be so kind as to send me the recipe? I've honestly searched high and low on dessert menus across the country for anything similar and I've had no such luck. Please Gladly, please provide the fix to my Banana Creme Jar obsession.  I'm giving you 5 stars because you deserve it, but hear me out!!",

When we approached the hostess table, we were quickly told that they were booked for the entire evening. We were somewhat confused since they had several 2-top tables open to the eye. As soon as I walked out the door, out of sheer curiosity, I opened my opentable app to see what they had available. Sure enough, they had a number of tables open this evening for 2.   I didn't book and will never consider eating here again. Can't believe what I just experienced.",

We picked off the restaurant week menu and then waited for the courses to start coming. I ordered the wedge salad and enjoyed it. My friends tried the seafood soup and the other salad. The first course was very good. We all ordered the scallops for our second course. I thought they were good, but not great. The vegetables were a little too marinated for me, but that's a personal preference. We were disappointed that the peanut butter dessert had been taken off the menu, so we had the chocolate pear dessert. I wasn't super impressed with it and didn't eat much of it. The experience was decent, with a good ambience and whatnot. However, it wasn't great and I felt disappointed overall due to having a higher expectation.",

    "text": "Updated review:   We went back and they definitely redeemed themselves. The food was phenomenal and our guests were very happy! They loved the Chopped Salad and Scallops (as I told them they would!) and are expecting to return.   Original review:  We had received an email stating their infamous Chopped Salad was only $4 this week and since it is hubby's birthday tomorrow we decided to go last night. We have always enjoyed going here as the food  and service has never let us down. Unfortunately the service last night did. We arrived for our 7:00 reservation and the lady who greeted us was very nice and told my hubby Happy Birthday (as I had mentioned it when I made the reservation) and when she seated us at our table she sat down a tent card next to his plate that indicated it was his birthday. I thought that was a really nice touch. We waited for quite a while before our waiter finally came over to our table. He asked us if we had been there before and when I told him we had and asked him if he needed to see my email for the $4 Chopped Salad he stated no it was not necessary. He then asked us for our drink orders and that's where my reasons for the poor review began. We both asked for iced teas and you could see his face visibly fall. He got this look on his face like he could not believe that he had been saddled with the table that was asking for iced teas and the $4 chopped salad special. Little did he know yet that we were planning on ordering a bottle of wine (in addition to two entrees) but needed time to review the wine list. He left to get our iced teas and after what seemed like a very long time he finally returned and set them on the table and turned away so quickly and walked away that he didn't even hear me ask for sweetener. So there we sat for another long time (without being able to drink any of our iced teas) before he finally came back to take our order. I asked him if we could have some sweetener for our teas and he said yes but again, were we ready to place our order? We then told him we also wanted a bottle of wine and that was when his demeanor changed. His face lit up and he became noticeably more engaged and attentive. He left to go and place our wine order and came back with our wine glasses but still no sweetener for the teas. I then had to remind him again and he finally brought it after another gentleman brought us our wine. We ordered the Chopped Salad for the both of us to share and it was superb! The combination of flavors from the couscous and the currants mixed with the salmon and the pinion nuts work very well together and the amount was perfect for the two of us to share. I ordered the Scallops, and since I have had them before, I knew just what to expect.  And I was happily not disappointed. They are served on a bed of sweet corn grits topped with pork belly bacon and a cola gastrique that really complements the perfectly cooked scallops well. Hubby had the Short Rib Pot Roast and it was so yummy. It was fork tender and the bed of sweet potato puree it was served on made for a deep and rich flavor. When we were finished with our meals the waiter came over to ask if we wanted any dessert. We both looked at each other and hem and hawed back and forth about what to order.  At this point I was thinking to myself that the waiter had never even acknowledged my husband's birthday and now he wasn't even offering anything to him to celebrate it. It's not that we wanted a free dessert because neither one of us are big sweet eater's anyways. But usually places do ask you if you want something (even if it's just a small bowl of plain vanilla ice cream) and what was the reason for the happy birthday tent that had been sitting on the table the whole time?? So I went ahead and told him no we didn't want to order any dessert and he brought us our check. So although the food was fantastic, the service lacked all around and really put a damper on this birthday celebration dinner.",

I always thought it looked okay, but pretty standard run-of-the-mill New American cuisine. My expectations were blown out of the water! The duck meatloaf is to DIE for, topped with fois gras and a cherry glaze. I dragged my boyfriend to come eat here with me again and he had the same reaction. If I had a choose a final meal, the duck meatloaf would be a definite contender. Service is prompt and unobtrusive. Cocktails here are also amazing.   The reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered the buttermooink burger on my second visit, and I found it to be incredibly dry and bland. There was very little to no dressing on my burger. They might have just been overwhelmed because of Restaurant Week, though. I would still definitely try this place again!",

    "text": "What's there to say about The Gladly that hasn't already been said?  With one of the bangin'-est whiskey menus in town, I adore their bar program--s/o to Brandon Casey, amirite? The whiskey menu alone is overwhelming, in the absolute best way. I'm on a bit of a Japanese whiskey kick since coming back from a Tokyo trip, and though they're somewhat rare in the valley, The Gladly has a pretty decent selection. If whiskey isn't your thing, have no fear; the cocktails are all excellent as well. The bartenders are always super friendly and willing to help out if you get too overwhelmed and have no idea where to even start.   Now, because I'm 24 and ballin' on a budget, my visits to The Gladly are pretty much reserved for special occasions--or, when I can make it there in time, happy hour--but it's my go-to when I feel like I've earned an extra fancy meal for whatever reason. And over the course of the dozen(ish) times I've been here, the experience always starts the exact same way: The Original Chopped Salad (Can we take a quick minute to praise whoever is responsible for changing the name back from the OMFG salad? Because that was real dumb and unnecessary). This is truly my favorite salad in the entire world, because let's be honest, it's only kind of a salad. It is, however, maximum delicious. I'm not even a huge fan of smoked salmon, but I would happily eat this salad every day for the rest of my life.   A semi-new addition to The Gladly, Donny's Raw Bar boasts fresh seafood from Chula (which I also adore). I'm not a huge fan of raw seafood, but the fella is, so I've tried a handful of the offerings. I avoided the raw oysters--I can't get over the texture-- but that Brown Butter Tuna is pretty damn tasty. He claims we have to go back so he can try the entire rest of the raw bar menu, AND all of the new gluten-free offerings (there are plenty!). No complaints here, if it means another Gladly visit for me.   I've had a variety of their entrees and always been blown away by all of them. I was shocked by how much I enjoyed the duck meatloaf, because I think we can all agree it's not the most appealing name. The pan-seared scallops are cooked perfectly, and them sweet corn grits make all the taste buds sing. But my favorite entree has to be the filet mignon. Cooked to medium-rare perfection and topped off with bone marrow butter? Sign me up over and over again. I had it at their New Years Eve dinner a couple years back, and it was really the best possible way to end a year. I think I scarfed the entire filet down in 10 minutes, then spent the next 2 hours complaining that I should've worn a dress instead of pants because I was much too full... a fairly common occurrence in my life.   The only semi-negative thing about The Gladly? Not the best parking situation. The small lot off to the side fills up fairly quickly, so it's usually best to either carpool or get there early. But really, the dicey parking shouldn't deter anyone from having one of the best meals of their lives here. Because they've somewhat-recently updated their menu, I'm making it a goal this year to go back and try all of the new plates. Wish me luck!",

    "text": "Really nice atmosphere, pretty restaurant and we had a sweet server but really the food and drinks were sub-par.   Drinks: I had the Aperol Spritz which was delicious but my brother ordered The Black Market drink and it was absolutely disgusting, not sure how he choked it down to be honest. The sorbet mimosas were pretty lack luster too.  Food: We came for Mother's Day brunch and the menu sounded delicious. I went with the crab cake Benedict special and unfortunately it was barely warm, had very little hollandaise and was served with a wilty salad. My Mom and brother tried the lemon blueberry sticky bun but were disappointed because it was not soft or served warm. My husband ordered the frittata and it was topped with what was called a \"tomato relish\" but was most certainly Old El Paso salsa. My sister had the biscuits and gravy and the biscuit was also hard.  All in all the food was pretty disappointing and we left hungry. However I can't speak to their dinner menu which I've been told is very good.",

My main concern being so close to 24th street and camelback was parking, so thrilled there was ample parking (I used the lot off 22nd) and came in the back. The decor 7 stars so modern chic, I love dark restaurants. The staff was amazing very attentive. Our server was so sweet and knowledgeable I took my friends advice who is a whiskey connoisseur and told me I had to get a special kind of ice cube because it is pure. What a production!!!! They have some device they bring to your table with your whiskey and mold and filter the ice into a large ball that takes out all the impurities and it is so perfect and clear (I've never had to pay $3 dollars for ice before but would gladly do it again and it doesn't melt fast. Brussels sprouts with grits delicious. I had the grilled cheese with BBQ meat and I asked if I could leave off the meat since I don't like BBQ our server said don't worry people complain it's not BBQ enough so I'm like okay leave it on. Great bread and fondu cheese the meat was tender my second bite I was like OMG it's sweet it is BBQ!!!!! But I bit into one of the pickled onions which I 100percent would leave off next time, other than that delicious.",

    "text": "We were the first customers here on a Thursday at lunchtime. The service was great. I ordered a cider shandy--delicious, complex-tasting drink--while my husband had a Kiltlifter from the tap.  Out of everything at our meal, we were least pleased with the appetizer. The noble bread consisted of only four pieces of bread, a scoop of in-house made butter, flaked sea salt, and a small mason jar of green olives with pits. The butter was amazing and yet the whole thing felt like a very small amount for $7. I'm glad there were just two of us to split it or it would have barely been anything.  I had to get the famous chopped salad! I ordered it with the salmon. It was absolutely delicious. The perfect amount and downright beautiful to behold. I really appreciated that the server inquired about the amount of dressing I preferred; I asked for a light amount and I didn't need to add any more.  My husband had the French onion wagyu burger with fries. He was very pleased. They cooked the meat just as he requested (most places overcook) and the fries were perfectly crisp. The ketchup they serve is made in-house and you can taste the fresh herbs in it, especially rosemary.  Tip: the lunch menu doesn't list the desserts, but they do serve them!   We ordered their new version of bread pudding as part of my Best Bread Pudding Quest. People, they do S'MORES BREAD PUDDING. As in, a massive chunk of bread pudding crowned with a 3-inch thick marshmallow, then toasted. On the side is a scoop of chocolate ice cream sprinkled with salt, pieces of graham cracker, and chocolate drizzle. Share this with someone you're intimate with, because it'd going to take a team effort to pull apart that big sticky marshmallow. The flavors are fantastic together, but even more, the textures...! Soft marshmallow, tender bread pudding, melting chocolate ice cream, a piece of graham cracker... oh yeah.   I should add, I had a sugar high for the next four hours. Didn't need dinner that night, that's for sure.  I'd visit The Gladly again. It's a great special occasion kind of place.",

This would be a great place to take someone on a date or catch up with an old friend.  We started off with the famous Chopped Salad, boy was it delicious.  I'm not big on fish so seeing the salmon did scare me a bit, but the smoked salmon in the salad wasn't overbearing. All the elements mixed together were really tasty.  I could drink that salad dressing straight up, very yummy.  The $18 Wagyu Burger was also enjoyable.  The bacon-onion marmalade had a sweeter taste to it.  What was even more scrumptious was the onion ash fingerling potatoes the burger was paired with.  WOW those potatoes were fingerling-ing good!!  The garlic aioli dipping sauce was the perfect compliment.  My wife ordered the Mac & Cheese small plate, which was actually a pretty big serving.  The mac was alright, nothing special.  Not on the same level as the salad, burger and fingerlings.  This place is a little pricy. We were $50 all in for the Chopped Salad, Macaroni and Cheese small plate and the Wagyu Burger.  Everything was really good except the Mac and cheese.  I wouldn't hesitate coming back, would love to see what they offer for happy hour.",

The Gladly is a modern American restaurant with an urbanized feel. I came with my foodie gang, and yes like the cheesy Broadway gang we sing and dance....when you're a foodie, you're a foodie you're a foodie - wink! (See Westside Story)  We started with their signature Chopped Salad; I mean com'on it's the best in town and well known at that and if you don't know; know it now! Our appetizers concluded with the Lamb Ribs and Vietnamese Pepper Shrimp. I didn't really cared for the ribs since it was tad bit chewy and overcooked and there was nothing Vietnamese about the peppered shrimp. I miss my Chopped Salad....  Moving on to Entrees, I ordered their Pork Chops, which was tasty and nicely cooked to perfection. I like anything with a raisin compote! My friends around ordered their Duck Meatloaf and thought it was phenomenal! I tasted it and thought it somewhat gamey. Not my cup of tea. Overall, the experience of The Gladly was fun and the service was tops. I wasn't too blown away by the food, but it's not to say it's not worth the visit. - Enjoy!",

When I first arrived and had seen the reviews, I was tempted to try the tacos or burger. Uh, no. The chopped salad is where it's at and rightfully how The Gladly has its fame. Ask the wait staff to mix it for you and you'll see just how intricately the ingredients blend together. Every piece is crucial to the overall taste. I recommend ordering it with avocado as that definitely livens things up, but I'm sure it would be fine on its own too.  Oh, and they also serve a great Arnold Palmer ;)",

My wife and I stumbled upon this place while in the area but had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We were promptly seated when we entered on a Sunday afternoon. I was primarily interested in their endless list of whiskeys from around the world but the entire was menu was stellar. I had two drinks--don't recall their name now but they were more or less Old-fashioneds. We started with the chop salad. Holy crap... all the reviews are correct. Just have it. We then had the rib roast which was cooked to perfection and they even made two dishes for us when we said we'd be sharing it. The waitresses were friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, and the best of all... at the end of our meal, John McCain walks through the door. We didn't want to disturb his dinner as he was eating but it was the first time I ever wanted to shake a republican's hand and tell him thanks for the good work and keep fighting the good fight. Anyhow, run... not walk.. RUN to The Gladly and give them a try!",

We easily take out of town guests to the Gladly because their menu has something for everyone and the atmosphere is incredible. You will love your experience there. Cheers!",

Located on East Camelback, the two tiered space with large windows that look out onto nothing but a patio and parking lot occupying a large footprint within one of several nondescript business parks, entry to The Gladly sees guests greeted promptly at the hostess stand and quickly ushered to a teensy two top a menu was presented, the first \"bud\" quick to follow as water was poured while mixed drinks were deferred.    Perusing the carte, some interesting items like duck meatloaf joining the \"signature\" chopped salad, but opting for only two appetizers as I'd just finished dinner down the road at Okra it was with another quick \"sounds good, bud\" that the waiter disappeared, back-servers left to do the heavy lifting thereafter with water refills frequent and empty plates quickly cleared.  Starting with a fondue that has apparently become a Gladly 'must-order' of sorts and following up the smoky cheese, sausage, fruit and dried bread with an overpriced $12 eggroll whose greasy skin did not do justice to Porchetta made by a highly acclaimed local Barbeque spot, it was with locally roasted coffee refreshing the palate that a short wait passed by, desserts soon delivered to a table now quite dark besides candlelight but thankfully more than enough to justify their costs and thereby rectifying the night.  Quite literally a menu that looked written for me, half of my favorite \"styles\" of dessert represented in the distinctive style of a Chef I truly miss from my mere 15 months in town, one would be hard-pressed to find a single flaw in any of Tracy's trio, the rum soaked cake finding levity in its pina colada fruit and streusel topping while the dark chocolate chess was bold and well textured, the Banana Pudding upstaging anything served down south in terms of taste as well as complexity, potentially the best Originals creation tasted to date and a very early contender for one of 2016's best.",

    "text": "The four of us had an incredible dinner last night at the Gladly.  It started with a placard on the table wishing my daughter a Happy Birthday.  Next the bar tender made both our teens a surprise mocktail.  They came in a copper mug and were delicious!  Our wine by the glass was reasonably priced and very good.  We ordered the Noble bread and Brussel sprouts as appetizers- perfect combination using the sweet corn grits, which the Brussel sprouts sit on, as a spread on the bread- yum!    We then had the Original Chopped Salad, Tuna Poke, Faroe Island Salmon and special of the night, pink Grouper.  Everything was cooked perfectly which is a feat for fish dishes, came out together and tasted amazing.  The blend of flavors the chef has created with this menu is terrific.  My personal favorite is the Chopped Salad- a must if you've never had it- full of different flavors- sweet, smoky, umami, and the smoky salmon lox is perfect.  The Tuna Poke is very light with lots of light cool flavors with the Asian pear and cucumbers.  For those that want a sizable piece of fish- get the salmon or grouper- great on a bed of smashed potatoes with a beurre blanc sauce.    As you can tell, we eat out a lot in the Arcadia Area.  Love food and will return the to Gladly on a regular basis after this meal.  Make a reservation as they are popular.  Our meal with the mocktails, 4 glasses of wine (designated driver present), appetizers, and dinners was just under $200.",

    "text": "I wish I could give 6+ stars!! Where to even begin??  My boyfriend and I were visiting from San Diego and wanted a nice, but not too fancy of a dinner. We went this Friday around 9pm and there were only 10 people there. We started with craft cocktails which were SO tasty!! To start, we got the Brussels sprouts which were out of this world!!!! They were cooked perfectly and sat on a hearty bed of grits. THE GRITS! Let me tell you... they were out of this world delicious! Creamy, taste and had sweet corn in it. We licked the plate clean!  Then, we shared the chopped salad. Not your traditional chopped salad but we were pleasantly surprised at the flavor and how all the ingredients worked together. Every bite was so flavorful!! Again, we licked the plate clean!  The main course: my boyfriend got the duck meatloaf over asparagus and grits and I got the short rib pot roast. Both dishes were KILLER! My short rib was so tender. It fell apart with each tear of the fork and it sat on a bed of a sweet potato and ginger puree. I wish I had a.] bigger stomach so I could have finished it. My boyfriends meatloaf was amazing too! Definitely an updated twist on a old favorite.  Even though our stomachs were filled to the brim, we had to get dessert! We ordered the buttermilk bread pudding. All I can say is that the bread pudding was cooked perfectly and the peach ice cream melted in your mouth... LITERALLY.  Overall, our experience here was INCREDIBLE! Highly, highly recommended! Everything from start to finish was delicious and our server was so helpful and knowledgable. Can't wait to go back!",

In general, great menu with many different choices of great tasting food - The service is the top notch, everyone is so friendly and willing to make your visit comfortable and fun - Great patio - Great Sunday Brunch  - Great cocktails - The Gladly Manhattan and  Dapper Daisy are some of my fav - The atmosphere is awesome. The ambiance gives me a top East Coast restaurant vibe. It is upscale but not pretentious.  - It helps that is only 5 minutes away from where I live. That is always a plus!

Let's start with the noise level, couldn't hear myself think, but okay, I'm no youngster. Finally to the food... $1 for bread and oil, ok but a mere teaspoon of oil for 4 slabs of bread? Give me a break! And when the entrees average $30+, appetizers start at about $10 and continue to over $20, perhaps the bread can be included. Main course was truly just FEH! Short ribs were overcooked and dried out, fish was tasteless, brussels sprouts bitter. We were really looking forward to this meal having heard nice things about the place, but this is absolutely a never again restaurant for me and my family!",

It's legitimately the best salad you've ever had, considered having, or fathomed having. It's not even funny how delicious that salad was. It's not even a salad. It's a 7-piece harmonic masterpiece for your freaking mouth.   I think the gladly is nice. Great environment, great atmosphere, great service. I just think that the food might be slightly overrated given that a cowboy ciao meal blew me out of the water for half the price.",

We had the Yummy Nuts - just that and perfect for munching. And the chicken wings - can't recall the name - were just spicy enough to make your tongue wake up. It's a beautiful place, and we can't wait to come back once we relocate to Phoenix.",

It's got a nice atmosphere -- a real old-fashioned high end cocktail bar, with a terrific assortment of liquor, in particular whiskeys and single-malts. Wow, could I have fun there with a few hundred $$ for a night's sampling.  But, it's not a cheap date. Even on happy hour, we spent $50 for the two of us with only three drinks between us, and a couple of appetizers. The grits with Brussel sprouts were tasty, but the sprouts were so hard they could hardly be cut with my knife and fork. The chopped salad looked amazing but was actually a bit of a disappointment because of the dry corn they use. We're used to salad corn being served as a fresh veggie, not a dried up and straw-tasting ingredient.   All in all, we'll try it again but not when we're looking for a happy hour. The drink sizes were a bit small -- the cocktail of the day was served in a small highball glass, and consisted of about four good sips with ice, at $6.   Service was outstanding at the bar, with Daniel and the other barmen serving up smiles and pleasant conversation.",

Started off with cocktails, got the Cigarettes and Coffee, and that was pretty good. They have a good selection of whiskeys and bourbon. The chopped salad was great. The duck meatloaf fell flat, the flavor just was not good. The dessert was a chocolate torte, which was sweet but not much flavor. I expected more from this place. Not sure why the marks were so high. Don't think I would come back, unless just for cocktails",

The service was also fantastic, our waiter provided us with a complimentary Original chopped salad. We also shared the mozzarella fondue which was rich and delicious. For my entree I had the scallops with grits which did not fail to please me even further with its well balance flavor profile and perfect proportion size. They are also very accommodating to vegetarians and made sure to set the pork served with the fondue on a separate plate and did not prepare my scallops with bacon.

The pro's:  Great service, fantastic atmosphere, delicious drinks, good prices, young chic crowd, and incredible food.  The cons - and really not even a big negative just factual:  Extremely noisy (If you want an intimate date just don't come here on a Saturday night), and a few people were dressed way too casually to be allowed in (board shorts, hat, wife beaters etc.)  I would definitely come back!  If you want a filet mignon with potatoes and asparagus included, come here!  Every steak restaurant I have been to is ala carte (and I've been to A LOT) so it was refreshing to see the good price included sides!  The hostess' were friendly and calm even though the place was ridiculously crowded.  Thanks for making the occasion amazing everyone!",

We were greated promptly and given a table.  The place was not busy.  The staff was hob nobbing with the guests.  We sat for 15 min before we were served water.  \"How is the poutine?\" I asked.  \"I don't have a clue,\" he responded.  OK, so the bus boy doesn't eat poutine, I thought.  Another 15 minutes went buy without anyone coming to our table.  We got up and left.  Why bother?  We never did see a server.  Plenty of staff, but no one at our table.  Will go elsewhere next time.

No mirrors, no pretty flower arrangements... how about NOT carpet? It's not a Pizza Hut!  Anyway, food was ok, they had a great venison dish that night.  They had some pretty tasty cocktails too. But our server ruined it. Our table was only about 1.5 feet from the wall, and he felt the need to walk THAT way every time he came to check on us- which felt like every 5 minutes.    There are plenty of other places nearby to go for better service, food and atmosphere. Oh, and they had a very small parking lot out front, with no valet. We found out later there is a large parking area around the corner and up a ramp down the street....tough to find unless you \"know\".  Best part? Our view of the skyscraper next door all lit up at night. Made us feel like we were downtown.",

Their menu is creative (but has something for everyone), and is certain to excite some of the taste buds you never knew you had.  I loved the incredible whiskey selection--I drank an aged Japanese whiskey that blew my mind, and to top it all off I got the \"ice ball\" which is incredible: basically, they take a solid brick of ice, and chisel off a cube, then stick it in a copper press that sculpts it into the most perfect sphere--it's more dazzling than a crystal ball--you can see your soul in your drink.  And it melts slowly too--you remember geometry right? Spheres have the lowest surface area of any shape!  That means a colder, less watered down beverage.  Attention to detail! Cheers!",

Every single thing on the menu that we tried was incredible.  My husband's food kind of blew his socks off. The Original Chopped Salad - yeah, it totally lives up to the hype. And his duck meatloaf was huge and tasty. I enjoyed the greens salad and a vegetarian menu offering consisting of cauliflower risotto and a heaping pile of roasted vegetables, which were the most delicious roasted vegetables I've ever had, and exactly what I wanted for dinner.   Oh, and the desserts, yeah, they were incredible. I definitely liked the Blondie more than the blueberry bread pudding, but both were totally fantastic.  However, the best part of the dinner was the drink menu. The Gladly has over 200 kinds of whiskey and bourbon, so my husband and I started off with a couple of their signature cocktails (everyone, you HAVE to try the Gladly Manhattan - it's outstanding!), and then moved into tasting some of their whiskeys. And each whiskey is served with an ice ball that they form right at your table! It was SO cool, and such an awesome experience to partner with our cocktails!  I really want to go back immediately.",

It was not overpowered by the citrus nor was it primarily alcohol. It's not an easy task to make a well balanced mimosa but the bartender did it perfectly. When we sat at the table I got the Biscuits and Gravy with brisket from Little Miss BBQ as recommended by the waiter. Being originally from Texas biscuits and gravy/brisket are two things I take very seriously, and there was not a disappointment. I was in total heaven. I was hoping to hear the live music but apparently the musician was running late. I'm ok with that though because I was completely focused on my food.",

When our server finally took our drink order, she came back with the wrong drinks. After they fixed the drink order we ordered one appetizer, the fondue, and that's the only reason this review has 2 stars. It wasn't bad.   Anyway...at first they delivered the wrong appetizer to us and that was all we needed to cut the night short and go somewhere else.   Service was unimpressive and menu was \"eh\".

We initially asked the waiter for a couple of minutes to select our entrees...15 minutes later we were flagging him down.  From the time we placed our orders it was 45 minutes to get our main dishes. Food was coming out of the kitchen at a glacial pace.  We had the burrata and the brussel sprouts for \"small plates\" and they were very small for the price.  I think there were a total of about 6 whole brussel sprouts cut in half--decent flavor but not wow.  Burrata had the best flavor.  The other dishes were the scallops--they got a good rating again not great.  I had the chicken which other yelp comments were rave--it tasted like it had been re-heated as the plate was lukewarm and the potato side was nothing special.  The entire event was 2 hours and we left feeling very meh. Best part--the staff kept the water flowing all night..won't be back for dinner but keeping it on the lunch list.",

The next course was lamb riblets.  They were pretty good with the pickled onions.  The meat doesn't really fall off the bone and the cut is pretty fatty so there isn't much meat on them.  So beware if you're on a date needing to impress!  The chopped salad as always is one of my favorite things to get here and at the Citizen Public House.  I chose the scallops as my entree which was also very awesome.  They were super soft served on a bed of grits and rapini(?).  I was going to pack up half of it but plowed right through because it was so delicious.    Dessert was bread pudding which came with a delicious caramel sauce.  It was actually quite dense for a bread pudding, it came out more like a cheese cake.  The bits with sauce and caramelization was very good, however, the rest of it was just a big old sponge that wasn't worth the calories to me.  I noticed the venue did a much better job in putting up signs and instruction for when you enter the restaurant from the parking lot (the old Ruth Chris entrance).  The service was top notch.  I think this may be one of the better restaurants in Phoenix and happy hour is definitely worth a visit.",

This place is definitely popular with the yuppie crowd. Don't let that stop you from going to dinner here.   From their specialized menu for restaurant week, my friend had the chopped salad, and I guess they're known for their chopped salad. She seemed to enjoy it. I started off with the butternut soup. It was a generous portion of deliciousness.   I had the pan seared scallops, which were slightly oversalted. They came under a nice bechamel sauce and I think some blanched spinach. It was still very good. My friend got the duck meatloaf, which I stole a couple bites of. One word: wow. I'm getting that when I come back.   The dessert was okay. It was a s'more style bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream. I've had better bread pudding.   We also split the fondue from the regular menu. It came with bread, ham, and Asian pears. It was my first experience with fondue. It was enough for two people to enjoy.   The service was excellent! Instead of asking who had ordered what course, the busboys automatically knew and placed your course in front of you. Every time someone came to check on you, they always refilled your water from the carafe they left in your table.",

Our server, Tim, was fun, knowledgeable, patient and attentive. The gentleman clearing dishes and making certain were always hydrated was so sweet and thoughtful and had a great smile! The entire crew worked together seamlessly and the ambiance was warm, comfortable and inviting to all people.   The food was incredible! We started with the Original Chopped Salad, Sausage, Brioche Pretzel and Cheese and Butternut Squash Soup. Unbelievable flavors in each dish. I am not a fan of seafood so I was going to refrain from the Original Chopped Salad due to salmon being an ingredient. Tim was fabulous (and very attentive, as I mentioned above) and offered me the chopped salad with chicken instead of salmon and I was thrilled! It was delicious! For our main entrees there were two filet mignon ordered and both were a True medium rare and medium, as ordered. My partner ordered the pan seared scallops and said they were done to perfection. I had the Chimichurri Chicken. It was subtlety spicy and the flavors were beyond my expectations! Everything was prepared and presented beautifully.    I haven't mentioned the cocktails yet...if you enjoy adult beverages, then check out the Old Man and the Sea, the Seasonal Moscow Mule and the Hand Crafted Sangria (and the Irish Coffee was fantastic after dinner!!). If you choose not to indulge in alcohol, then the jasmine iced tea and the coffee were delicious as well!   We ended the evening with mouthwatering desserts. We ordered the S'mores Bread Pudding and the Lemon Verbena Bar. A perfect ending to a perfect evening!   The entire evening from beginning to end was a delight. We will certainly share our experience and we will be enjoying more of The Gladly! A big thank you to the impressive crew! You made it a fabulous, special event.",

We would go there again just for drinks outside.  Walking in on a Thursday night around 8pm for a late dinner, we were seated immediately by a very welcoming hostess. She told us who our server would be. Our server arrived late on the scene, acting very comfortable and casual--which is nice and all-- but she took her time in getting to us for our drink orders, and then twice as long to bring the drinks. The restaurant was not busy at all, and eventually she got into a rhythm with us. Overall, the service is very dicey--not a professional staff as might be expected at these prices. It's staff they obviously hire off the street without much experience.  I ordered a \"Manhattan\", but she brought me the \"Gladly Manhattan\". It was a nice drink (and pricey), but not what I was expecting. I'm in my late 40's and wanted my parents' no nonsense version of it over ice--so perhaps one needs to specify at this place, although I shouldn't have had to do that. I didn't order the \"Gladly\" version. Anyway, I rolled with it.  My dining companion ordered the egg roll starer and the scallops over grits as an entree. I ordered the pate' starter and a small plate of lamb riblets as my main.  The egg roll was tasty. The scallops were heavy on the bacon fat, which could have been good, but the added pieces of bacon were too chewy, and the scallops were not tender. The flavor was a bit overwhelming with the added pork fat. The dish should have been velvety--it was not.  The pate' was very good. It was the perfect amount for a starter, a nice amount, in fact. They pair it nicely with pickled red onion and capers, along with hot mustard and VERY crispy toasts. Adorable presentation and very good, especially with the bourbon. Not the best we've ever had, but overall quite memorable with the pairings.  The lamb ribs were a let down. Too fatty and not tender enough. The flavor was fine, but underwhelming. They do taste of lamb, but lack the gamey flavor of shanks, which I actually prefer. There was too much gristle on the bone, and the dish was overpowered with more of the pickled red onion. We feel the red onion is perfect for the pate' starter, but just wrong for the riblets. We wouldn't get these again.  We both ordered the chocolate caramel tart for desert. It looked exactly as described, but the crusts were practically frozen. It wasn't pleasant to cut and put into our mouths. The flavor was entirely underwhelming, and we couldn't taste the smoked paprika, the orange bitters...or the salt in the chocolate ice cream--all the very reasons we ordered them. It was boring and disappointing. We wouldn't get those again.  I want to like The Gladly more than I do, so we will give it another shot. There are so many other good restaurants in Phoenix, we don't feel like this one is up to snuff for the price. It isn't that great of a value. They seem to try really hard, though. I guess it depends on how spoiled you are to really good food. If you've been exposed to truly great food you might be disappointed here. It's average upscale dinner fare at very expensive prices.",

Had a reservation of 20 set up, was given a private dining room which was secluded from the rest of the restaurant, and was greeted with exceptional customer service. Our server Zach went above and beyond, was really attentive of every single one of us and brought everything in a timely manner. Honestly, I never really do reviews but this is such a great place to come to. Drinks are great and the food was like heaven for my taste buds. I was particularly blown away with the amount of detail they put into my reservation. Had my name on the menu and customized it to my specific needs. They even put on the World Cup for me to watch on one of their big screens. Can't wait to come here again!!! Thank you!!!!",

I feel bad to have forgotten her name, but I was anxiously awaiting my sister's arrival (we were surprising her, she had no idea).  The server was blonde, very high energy, and funny, so if you see her, you're in good hands!  She waited patiently about 30 minutes before my sister even got there and she helped to plan out a special birthday treat for her (chocolate caramel tart - AMAZING).   We got the chopped salad (INCREDIBLE, must get!!), brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, scallops, and burgers.  All of the food was phenomenal!  If you like Bleu Cheese, then you will definitely like the burger because it has a rich bleu cheese spread on it.  The scallops are always cooked to perfection!  Overall, it was a great experience because our server was incredible! She made for a wonderful celebration!!",

    "text": "We dined here on a Monday night.  I've had The Gladly on my mind to visit since it opened so it seemed fitting to come here for our wedding anniversary.  I made reservations through Open Table and noted that we would be celebrating our anniversary with them.    We had celebrated our last dating anniversary in this same building when Ruth's Chris occupied it.  We and such an awesome experience so we thought it'd be kinda cool to come back.  How different The Gladly is!  The new tenants have shed the white linens and replaced it with a cool, modern vibe.  Upon arrival, I told the host we had made reservations at 7:30.  We were led to a table almost immediately, which was nice.    I ordered the short ribs and my husband ordered the filet mignon.  My short ribs were placed atop a bed of mashed sweet potatoes.  The meat was topped with pickled corn and onions.  The short ribs were cooked perfectly.  It was tender and moist.  However, it lacked a depth in flavor that I look for in a comfort food like short ribs.  The sweet potato and corn relish accompaniment was a little overwhelming, and to me, the flavors in the dish just didn't marry.  My husband's filet mignon was outstanding!  They served it on mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The dish is then topped with bone marrow butter.  How awesome does that sound?!  The filet mignon I would return for!  For dessert, we had the lemon verbena bar with cream cheese and berry ice cream. I really liked it and the coffee we had with it was a good pairing.  Sadly, we were never greeted for our anniversary.  I put it into the reservation details, but as it turns out they never checked us in!  I got this email today from Open Table saying that we missed our reservation and they asked me to explain why.  That's a little offensive, and though I understand the importance of this, I blame the host for this since I made it a point to tell him we had reservations.  It's not the end of the world, but we could have gone anywhere for our special day, and yet we chose them!  A simple acknowledgement would have been nice.  We weren't expecting a dessert with happy anniversary scribbled in chocolate, although that would have been nice, too. :)",

It was cooked to perfection and was just enough for someone who had fondue appetizer :).  The drinks were really the highlight - they specialize in whisky and they served some very unique options for this - I am not a whiskey drinker, but I loved my drink.  I had the 'newcomer' or something like that - it is for non-whiskey drinkers.  It is a little hard to find - you have to go around the corner and into another building and down the stairs, but I would go again.  There seems to be ample outdoor parking and the service - especially our waiter Lance - was REALLY AWESOME - attentive, funny - the best.",

    "text": "I struggle with this review because we really did have a pleasant experience but there were some things I thought needed some addressing.   Pros: First off, the service here is top notch, really. Everyone from the host/hostesses to the server to the busser were on point and friendly.  Wacky hair server tim was really awesome, and really helped our dining experience. Drinks were good, although the maple syrup in the Manhatten made it a smidgin too sweet for my tastes. They also make absolutely perfect ice balls from scratch at the table for $3. Seems like a nickel and diming but at least they allegedly give $1 of each cube to charity. The chopped salad  was really yummy, the spotlight being the smoked salmon. Without it, the salad would lack. For dessert, I swooned for the bourbon apple pudding; my husband ordered the chocolate mousse I believe and it was okay. Apparently they make their own ice cream and the mint and insanely good.  The Cons: The entrees were both good, for sure, but in my opinion lacked seasoning. The pork chop was good alone, but when paired with the accompaniments was virtually tasteless. The duck meatloaf was super tender and the \"grits\" (I don't think they were grits but were very similar) were yummy but I thought the sauce was kind of lacking. Again, thought maybe there weren't enough herbs in the meatloaf. I hate salt but love pepper. Thought it very odd there was no shaker on the table.  Overall the dinner was pleasing but for the price ($150 w/drinks at the $33pp restaurant week) I expected a smidgin more. I thought the price was fair for scottsdale but the ambience just wasn't matching. I might come again and I'm glad I tried it. Just needs a little extra for me.",

    "text": "First off, our waiter was great. He kinda reminded me of Giorgio Tsoukalos from Ancient Aliens, meaning he had wild hair, was opinionated, and he spoke with passion.  He literally waved off our brussels sprouts order and told us to get the chopped salad as a starter instead. He was right. I am sure the sprouts are great bc everything I had that night was fire. That salad doe.... oh man. Light, beguiled, refreshed, sensual, seduced, crisp, invigorated, awed- those are a bunch of seemingly random words. But they all kinda help describe how my mouth felt eating that salad. GET IT.  We also had the charred octopus for a starter. More seemingly random words- smoky, delighted, playful, loved, caressed. GET IT.   Then the mother load dropped in front of me....  Duck Meatloaf.  To properly describe this experience, 1) I want to write a letter from my mouth to this delicious beast, and 2) I need the assistance of the Prince of Soul himself. Mr. Marvin Gaye...  Come take control, just grab a hold Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it, honey oh we're feeling fine You're my medicine, open up and let me in Darling, you're so great I can't wait for you to operate  Again, I don't know if thats the most accurate way to describe my evening, but it's all i can do with my limited means to best describe the sensation of the duck meatloaf  GET IT.",

The chicken liver pate is a must have item for me.  It is set perfectly.  But is creamy and the addition of pistachios provides the occasional change in texture and flavor.  They are know for their chopped salad and for good reason.  The smoked salmon and Asiago are a wonderful combination.  It is hard to eat this slow it is so good.   I also thoroughly enjoyed the duck meatloaf.  It is finished of with a foie gras mousse that is so good I wanted twice a much.  Heck maybe it should be an appetizer.",

I have too say that The Glady is one of the better eateries in the Phoenix Area with enough choices too satisfy every taste bud.   In addition, to The Gladly's large selection of entrees The Gladly has a surprisingly large selection of Scotch and Whisky. On this visit I ordered the Duck and Pork meatloaf. It was unbelievably delicious  My dinner companion had the steak salad. He said the greens were crisp, fresh with a nice portion of perfectly cooked steak in a light dressing (rum raisin) and a cheese crostini on top.  All our entrees were absolutely delicious, artfully prepared, and the portions are reasonably sized. Everything earned raves.  If you're looking for an amazing dining experience, excellent service, accommodating and welcoming staff you have to try The Gladly",

Lol.   It was pretty crowded when we got there, but I had made a reservation so we were sat right away by the window, which I loved. Their patio looks so nice, I definitely want to come back when it's nicer out! Our server was super nice and fun as well, though we did have a lot of people taking care of us, and we at times had to wait long periods before being helped.   To eat, with started with the Gochujang Crispy Rock Shrimp, and they were really good! I didn't love the sauce, but that's just me - my fiance loved it. For entrees, I of course got The Original Chopped Salad because it was $1 that night, and because I'd always wanted to try it. It was delicious! As a salad lover, I have to say it wasn't so much a salad to me and I would have liked more greens, but it was still super good. The only sad part was that our server mixed it up before I even had a chance to take a photo lol.   My fiance got the Grilled Cheese with Little Miss BBQ meat - that was amazing! I'll definitely order that next time we come. For his side he got the fingerling potatoes and those were awesome, too.   Overall this place is a bit expensive I think, but you do get a great atmosphere (it feels very casual but classy :)).",

They bring out a square block of ice and press it into a beautiful, crystal clear ice ball for your drink. It's a $3 up charge that is well worth it.   I had the Thai Margarita- it did not disappoint!  Perfect mix of sweet & spicy... YUM!   Food:  Being \"foodies\" we decided to order 6 appetizers ...every single one was delicious!  The Rock Shrimp & Crab Cakes were my 2 favorites... I will be back for these!   Atmosphere: Beautiful decor & lighting. The crowd was a great mix of all aged adults. There were dinner dates and larger groups. We easily had great conversation - no need to raise our voices to be heard over the other diners.   Can't wait to take my husband here so he can experience it too.",

We promised ourselves to try new dishes, but the birthday boy couldn't, so he had the duck meatloaf, which is OMG incredible.  I did try new things, the crispy shrimp appetizer and the salmon.  The crispy shrimp had such complex flavors, spicy, crispy, umami, sweet - definitely something I want again, and the salmon was beyond perfect.  I felt it was literally caught hours before (as I have had salmon that I have personally caught in Alaska and eaten it that night - THIS WAS THE SAME).  But alas, we were in Arizona, so it was amazing it was sooo good!  Dessert - I love that the 'fruit tart' was a coconut chocolate pastry.  It was insanely good, and not overly sweet!  Drinks were stellar, their bartending staff is creative as hell, and every drink was perfect to my ginny palate..",

We had to move stuff and pile plates to make room for the dishes. Someone should prepare the table when needed before bringing new plates. Other than that service was excellent, adapted to our pace.

Our server was polite and sweet.  We all ordered different items and everyone was very pleased with their selections.  Mine was scrumptious!  I had their duck meatloaf with millet and a cherry sauce.  It was really packed with flavor and a super generous portion so I was able to take almost half of it home and was still totally satiated.

I thought I was coming down with a stomach sickness due to feeling nauseous and up with stomach pain throughout the night until talking with co workers the next day. Out of the 10, 6 of us ate seafood and all of us were sick or nauseous after dinner. I gave 2 stars cause the others who didn't have seafood enjoyed their food and and did not get sick.

    "text": "\"I'll gladly repay you Tuesday for The Gladly's chopped salad today\" -- Wimpy on Weight Watchers  Food: 4* Service: 4* Ambiance: 2*  For Restaurant Week The Gladly's menu looked very intriguing. It had all their greatest hits on the menu so I decided to give them a try. I had thought that making a reservation during the weekday would ensure that it wouldn't be too busy but the dining room was pretty crowded when we got here.  I had the chopped salad, duck meatloaf and the sole option for Restaurant Week dessert was a chocolate olive oil torte. I absolutely loved the chopped salad. It had everything I look for in a salad: fresh ingredients, a melange of textures and flavors, the perfect amount of dressing, and it was beautifully presented to boot. I would go back here for the salad alone!   The duck meatloaf was decent.  For me the real star of the show in this dish was the foie gras mousse. It was so silky smooth and rich. I didn't really like the slightly mushy, nearly risotto-like texture of the millet with the meatloaf. I felt like the textures of both were too similar and the meatloaf's flavor didn't gel well with the millet.  The torte was also decent. I love Korean pear but I'm not sure it was the best choice for a dark chocolatey dessert such as this torte. With such a delicate flavor the pear was overshadowed by the chocolate. The texture of the torte itself was also a little grainy for my tastes.  Service was friendly, albeit a bit frazzled due to all the customers eating here.   The one real killer for me was the noise level and the general ambiance. It was fairly full when we were here, maybe 70-80% of capacity. It was so annoyingly loud in the dining area and I could barely hear conversation at our table or not hear at all. The ambiance seems to have an identity crisis, for the lighting was so dim as if it was attempt to create a romantic atmosphere but the table set up and lack of sound dampening in the room indicated otherwise.  There is a nice patio out back which does seem better for dining in a more relaxed environment so if I go back maybe I'll try some al fresco dining.",

    "text": "When you dine out as regularly as my girlfriend and I do, you eventually become jaded by certain types of restaurants. And what's funny about The Gladly is that, by simply taking a glance at their setup, I probably could have ordered an entire multi-course meal without even looking at their menu. As embarrassing as it is, you simply just know what to expect when it comes to the whole \"Modern-American\" restaurant-style.  Some fish and chicken dishes, the obligatory filet mignon, an upscale burger, perhaps a short rib plate, a few tacos, and wait - where's the charcuterie board? Oh, there it is! The only thing missing were a couple of pastas to really round things out.  Seen it. Done it. Over it.  And when you've reached this point, it becomes less about being intrigued by the types of foods available and more on the execution in comparison to what you've tried elsewhere. But after studying their menu more closely and noting some of their sources (i.e. Little Miss BBQ, Noble Bread), I thought that perhaps this place has a bit more to offer than I originally assumed.  It was restaurant week, which seems to be when practically half of all of their Yelp reviews are written. My girlfriend chose their three-course menu, while I dislike restrictions and decided to order things from their dinner menu.   Their chopped salad, which combines a multitude of decent ingredients, was quite good. The smoked mozzarella fondue was a bit underwhelming, giving you some bits of bread, ham, and pear to dip at your leisure.   Their buttermoink burger, which uses noble bread, was excellent, as was their grilled cheese, which uses meat from Little Miss BBQ. I particularly enjoyed the smoky flavor, even if the onions were a bit overpowering. Sides of fingerlings and fries were okay, while the additional side of risotto that we ordered would have otherwise been bland if not for the addition of some pepper seasoning.  For dessert, they only offered a chocolate olive oil torte, which came off more like a cold brownie than anything else. These were made in massive bulk for restaurant week, which is probably why they were forgettable and not something I'd order again.  Servers weren't very engaging and the scene skewed far older than I had originally assumed. Not that there's anything wrong with that. After sleeping on it and looking at our bill, for the quality of the food we received, I'd say they hover around the 3-4 star mark in comparison to what else is available.  In terms of Modern-American, it's probably one of the better options, but overall, aside from some very good main courses, the overall meal left a lot to be desired. At 70 plus dollars for two people that don't drink alcohol, I guess we expected a bit more. But then again, we're a picky pair.  Recommended to try out.",

Well done Gladly- sometimes the quality slips when you're getting items to take out...Not here!! Beautiful presentation even in a to go box!   Six Stars !! This was our first visit and it won't be the last!! Love the atmosphere that's rich & elegant but not stuffy! Great patio and views from interior to patio so romantic as well. We were here celebrating a new career move over lunch. Our server Monica was on point being welcoming, informative and anticipated our needs perfectly! I had the signature salad- here's where I give that 6th  the arugula was Trimmed Properly! I love arugula, but if I serve it I take the time to remove the stems that are often hard & bitter. So many restaurants don't bother with removing them and often it can ruin the whole dish. Thank you The Gladly!!! My husband had the vegetable & red rice which was good choice for him- it would be Awesome to see what other dishes that are vegan they could design for the palette! I'm excited to return preferably for an evening on the patio under the twin",

We got the Crispy Rock Shrimp, chopped salad and the fondue. Everything was fabulous, but the Rock Shrimp was the best thing I've ever tasted!! Seriously, order it. You won't regret it. The chopped salad was wonderful and the ham with the fondue was the best ham I've ever tasted. So much flavor.  Then they brought us out this delicious apple cake (can't remember what it's called) and we devoured that in seconds!   It was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!!",

The Prix Fixe menu feature a selection of their dishes for what I thought was a pretty reasonable price.   I had the Chopped salad and it was amazing. The salmon was fresh and finely chopped and there was some freeze dried corn which provided a great texture to compliment the otherwise mushy conglomeration.  The Steak was superb. It was grilled to perfection with an herb butter.  The mashed potatoes and other accoutrement were equally delicious.  We tried both the available desserts.  One was a coffee brownie and the other was a bread pudding.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of brownies, but in this case i would say the Bread pudding stole the show.

A 18ounce ribeye with a habenero risotto with white beans and homemade sausage and grilled asparagus. Seriously. De-frickin-licious. Spicy but fantastic.   3. Decor/restaurant design. Meh. They tried to be new and hip and trendy but the decor lacks depth and texture. The wall with the painted bookshelves and painted wall sconces on it is awkward and out of place and reminds me of an Olan Mills back set of the cheesy mid 80's family portrait we have all tried so hard to forget ever happened. (Yes, I know. Run on sentance. What are you? THe Yelp grammar police?)  In conclusion, add some design to the building. Change NOTHING else. LOVE this place. Will go back.",

Great ambiance, trendy bar, and very friendly staff.  I started off with a cocktail: Venice Shandy.  A little sweet, but refreshing.  Great way to start off a vacation!  We started off with their Original Chopped Salad.  The menu noted a Facebook page for it so we figured it must be good.  It's definitely not the typical chopped salad you'd expect.  This one had smoked salmon, freeze-dried corn, tomatoes, Israeli couscous, greens, tomato, sunflower seeds with black currants and they mix it in front of you with buttermilk dressing.  It's good enough to share for 2.  By far, this is the BEST salad I've had that I was dying for the recipe.  Sure enough, recipe found online: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azfamily.com%2Fcommunity%2Fblogs%2Farizona-cooking%2FHave-you-tried-Arizonas-State-Salad-231931881.html%23recipe&s=ca11ccf300c8a0f9440dc877546417b3b7ed85525ce473c41cd7cb673a4266c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azfamily.com/community/b...</a>  For dinner, I had the Coffee Charred Short Ribs.  It came with barley, blueberry compote and spinach.  The dish itself was a pretty big portion, but after sharing with my husband, we finished it all.  The meat was really tender and it just fell off the bone.  It had some sweetness to it, but with a nice hint of coffee.  I also enjoyed eating the barley with the sauce that I couldn't stop eating it.  My husband had the Duck Meatloaf.  It was a hefty portion as well.  Went very well with the cherry glaze.    Overall, it was a great meal.  We definitely enjoyed our dinner while watching the dust storm outside.  The glass doors kept blowing in the wind.  Our server was friendly and was very knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant when we asked.  For a night out in town, come down for a good meal and tasty drinks!",

PS, you should totally get the ice ball, they have this contraption that makes a crystal clear ball of ice for your whiskey, right at your table.    The service alone really deserves 5 stars, but then the food!  Fantastic.  My fiance and I  started with the fondue, then we had the short ribs and a burger.  We finished with the goat cheesecake, which was amazing.  The rest of our party loved their food as well, and  I sampled quite a few of people's cocktails and desserts - they were all fantastic.   Speaking of cocktails, this is the place.  I have been wanting to try a negroni for awhile, but I was afraid to try one that might be less than stellar.  I knew this was the place to try one, as they actually have them on tap!  My fiance tried a Manhattan for the first time, and he loved it.  Really, all of the cocktails are  awesome.  This is a rare find in Phoenix, I highly recommend it.",

A guy (not sure if it was the waiter or not) came to give us water and ask if we wanted a drink, we asked for another minute to decide.  About 15 minutes later my husband started to the bar to place our order, he was met by another guy who we thought was the manager.  The \"manager\" came to take our drink and food order, we waited 20 minutes and still had nothing-not even our drinks.  We got up and left and walked right past the \"manager\" who looked at us and said nothing.  The food might be great but we'll never know because the service was so bad!",

Not with the service or the trendy atmosphere... It was the food. And we tried a lot of it with multiple recommendations from the waiter.   1. Fondue (2 out of 5 stars)... Cheese was a 10, but the accoutrement was just meh. ESP the smoked pork butt which should have been the star. It was basically processed Canadian bacon cubed up.  2. Pecan smoked grilled vegetables (1 out of 5 stars). Weird rutabagas, parsnips and baby carrots with some weird chick pea pancake. Was supposed to have manchego cheese on it, but no dice. Not sure it would have helped.  3. Octopus salad (2 out of 5 stars). Octopus was good, but the overall flavor profile was WAY too aggressive. From the peppercorns to the bitter grapefruit. No beuno. We should have stuck to the chopped salad, but stupid us for trying something new.  4. The Pigstrami (5 out of 5 stars). The sandwich is Bomb! The pastrami is think cut, tender, some of the best I've ever had. Great cheese, rye bread and housemade ketchup for the fries. I'd come back for this.   Good beer selection, good drinks, but much better food at CPH. If you go and check out the Gladly, steer clear of the \"misses\" outlined above.",

It was hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. So different and like nothing else.   Our main courses were all mediocre besides for my sister's scallops. I would definitely recommend getting drinks and appetizers at The Gladly. I had the mule and it was quite refreshing. I would definitely recommend this place but only for appetizers and drinks.",

I was not a fan at all of the duck meatloaf. I don't know if it was the duck or the foie gras butter that I didn't like but it was too unique and strange for me.

    "text": "My husband and I were visiting the Phoenix area for a Birthday getaway.  We came to the Gladly for my birthday dinner.  We were seated right away and after a brief wait, our server came over to greet us.  We started our meal with the smoked mozzarella fondue.  I took one bite of the ham dunked in the salty, smokey cheese and I knew I was done for!  It was perfectly delicious.  My first drink of the evening was the Thai Margarita.  That Thai Chili Sea Salt on the rim was a spicy surprise (dunno why - it said it right there ON the menu), but one that I enjoyed.  My husband started with the Suntory Times High Ball, as he'd never had a Japanese whiskey before.  The invisible ice cube was cool, but he said that the drink just seemed like a watered down whiskey.  At least now he can say he's had that.  On to our main course - O.M.G.  I was torn between the coffee rubbed short ribs and the duck meatloaf.  My server recommended the duck, and I was not disappointed!  My husband had the buttermooink burger, which he said was quite possibly the best burger he'd ever had.  He said that it was perfectly cooked (med rare) and the flavors were just incredible.  We finished the evening with the salted caramel pot de creme.  The custard had a very subtle flavor, but when mixed with the AMAZEBALLS cookie, it was perfect.  They even put a little candle in it for me to blow out.  :-)  We finished our meal with a couple drinks - I had the Tawny Port and Hubby had the Middleton Barry Crockett, both of which were a perfect ending to the evening.  When we come back to AZ (because we WILL), we will definitely come back to The Gladly again!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Like my tagline says, life's too short for bad food AND drink.  This 5-star review is bumped up for not only the quality of their cocktails, but their very nice selection of brown liquors.  This place is sleek and modern, we often bring out-of-town guests here, none have been disappointed.  The entrance is a little funky and it's located at the base of an office building, but that matters less.  We've ordered most of the menu.  The chicken liver pate is solid and worth ordering.  We were not a huge fan of the Hillbilly egg rolls, despite the fact they use Little Miss BBQ meats.  It's a little salty, a little clunky, not the best dish on the menu.  The original chopped salad is one of our favorites.  We occasionally see rip-offs elsewhere in the Valley, this is still the most balanced and best.  The brussels sprouts are average.  The octopus and crab cakes are both quite tasty, never had tough octopus here.  We've had every main except the filet and the short ribs.  I would say the standouts are the scallops, chimichurri chicken, and the pork chop.  The chicken has never been dry for me, all have been cooked perfectly.  Please make use of their bar.  Look at it, it's a thing of beauty.  Read their whiskey list.  There are bottles not on that list, ask about them.  And drink.  Drink their cocktails, drink their whiskey.  Take it all in.",

The food was pretty good, but not one of the better brunch meals I've ever had. I did really enjoy the all day happy hour deals for Sunday especially the Brussels sprouts! They were on a bed of grits and I could taste the drizzled truffle oil. For $5 on happy hour, it was absolutely delicious and you should definitely try it.  The pork hash I ordered wasn't memorable, but the ambiance was lovely. Service was also quite slow (e.g. coffee took forever to come out) even though the restaurant wasn't packed.",

We also thoroughly enjoyed the scallops and egg roll. Service was superb and everything came out fresh and piping hot (with the exception of the salad... duh!). When in the area, I'd highly recommend this joint although I'd give it $$$ not $$.",

We ordered the Field Greens, Spicy Seared Tuna (appetizer), Burrata (appetizer), and a special they had: beet gnocchi with scallops.  Loved all of it!  We shared all 4 dishes.  Total was less than $70.  Service was great.  Would definitely go back.",

We came on Sunday and had a pleasant surprise of all day Happy Hour on Sunday until 6 PM.  Don't threaten me with a good time.    The food was on point, as always.  The Boy ordered their smoked wings from the HH menu and the Roasted Brussel Sprouts.  I ordered their ridiculously crave-able Original Chopped Salad.  The boy loved his wings, the brussels were good, a bit tough, but the sweat corn grits saved the day.  We also tried the Noble Bread appetizer which was good but our eyes were too big for our stomachs.  Drinks were awesome, I got the $5 rose from HH and The Boy tried the Beginners Luck off their Barrel Aged menu.  The service was iffy.  It's Sunday so I am not expecting to be wowed but the girl who stirred my salad took the rest of the dressing off the table when she left.  I requested more from our server but it never came.  Service was slow and infrequent.  The atmosphere was laid back but that doesn't mean the service should be.  We enjoyed our experience and will be back.",

We are SO glad we did. The service was great, but the drinks and food were Fantastic. My wife is vegetarian, so we opted for the Brussels Sprouts to start. They were incredible. And, honestly, if the experience stopped there, we would still come back on the regular. The sweet corn grits they rested on - perfection. For dinner, she had the OMFG salad, which I know to be excellent. And I opted for the crab cakes - definitely enough to be had as an entree. All was delicious. At Citizen Public House, we're pretty faithful to the Instant Gratification drink. It's their fancied up version of an Old Fashioned, in my opinion. So at The Gladly we tried the Beginner's Luck. Did not disappoint.   As a lesbian couple, we had a wonderful night and we'll definitely be back.",

Tip - always make reservations after 6:30pm - they're always packed with reservations and hardly have room for walking-ins.   The mozzarella fondue is so great! The bread is the perfect amount crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, the pork belly delicious, and the pears were a fun addition!!!  The duck meatloaf is a super unique dish - not too gamey and wonderful! The Foie gras mousse on top really makes it!",

I got the seared pan scallops and my boyfriend got the Seabass. We both were craving good seafood - and this place was perfect for it. We were staying at the AC Hilton Biltmore for work event and this place was what's recommended to us.  Kinda hoping they would add another piece of scallop for that price ($33+ - comes with 3 pieces so one scallop for 10bucks lol?) - hence the one star off. But overall, good experience and will come back to try their other specialties!",

My wife and I both said it might have been up there with the best we've had (it is pretty spicy).  We got the Brussels Sprouts off the happy hour menu as well which were good. We wanted to order the Kimchi Wings but unfortunately they share a fryer with the breaded fish.  For dinner I got the scallops and my wife got the Short Rib. I got the scallops over the ricotta risotto and the scallops were very good but the risotto was just so-so. The risotto wasn't as creamy and flavorful as we had hoped.  My wife got the Short Rib with the cherry bbq sauce that was very good. We both enjoyed that dish A L.  My wife got the blueberry lemon pie.

    "text": "I finally made it to The Gladly on May 18th.  After hearing years of comments about this place,  I was excited to eat here!  The natural interior is current and lovely.    Decorated with greens and wood, it gives off a fresh vibe.    Pretty interior but voices travel..... in the section where we were sitting, anyways.   We had issues with hearing our own conversation due to the table down from us, who were a tiny bit overexcited.    The Gladly showed efficient service for refilling water glasses and picking up the dishes from the appetizers and soup.  Our server did though, forget to bring my drink.  After spotting some of their popular dishes on the restaurant week menu, we decided to go that route. I had the opportunity to sample their \"original chopped salad\" which was very small but  fresh and  fabulous tasting including the salmon and avocado.    The pan seared scallops were delicious with the ssweet corn grits and the deglazed cola sauce was dazzling!   A bit on the plain side was the malted bread  pudding but with a tad more praline sauce and mascarpone whip this would be my kind of dessert.    Ladies restroom was modern and clean.  Private dining room is available.    Both of us decided to go for more to eat at another establishment due to not being full after finishing our courses here.  I totally understand that the portions are smaller due to the special offerings menu for restaurant week but we were still hungry!",

I will say that if you intend to go to this place you should be hungry because the food is fantastic.  The second time I went the bartender hooked me up with a drink. It was some type of bourbon. I never had bourbon before and so he let me try a couple. And then, he made me a drink on the house. I cannot stress to you enough how kind the people are. The last time that I went the server actually cared to have conversation that was more than just Smalltalk. Of course, she had a bunch of other tables so I know that she could not stay but she tried, and I appreciate that.",

If you are a purist you will not find the typical flavor, that you are used to... Excellent service from our bartender. Lively music. In general all the employees seemed friendly. Only negative, the parking spaces appeared narrow and were very limited in numbers... it didn't help that I was driving a large truck of course! We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The gladly was very good all around. Parking was a bit interesting, it always is in this part of town and it's a short hike from the parking garage to the restaurant. Finding the entrance was a bit interesting here, not impossible, but we found ourselves coming into a business building, then through a small \"back\" staircase that lead us into the back of the restaurant next to the bar. I'm still not sure where the actual front door was, but ultimately it was actually kind of cool because it was unusual.  Atmosphere: we initially sat inside and then realized they have a really cool outdoor patio. One side faces the street, but they've put boxed trees and lights around so you feel comfortably surrounded by nature and are outside enjoying the weather and starry skies. Inside looked really cool, with dim lighting and comfortable seating and high-end finishes and a really upscale, comfortable bar. We simply preferred the fresh air being on the patio. Our patio table and chairs were relatively comfortable. Table cloths and nice silverware and dishes continued the classy feel of the restaurant while still making us feel comfortable.  Service: Our service was excellent. Our server was informative and made excellent recommendations. Food delivery and refills were attentive and friendly. No complaints here whatsoever.  Food: The three of us really enjoyed our meals. The ingredients were quality, fresh and visually appealing. The taste was decent, not over-the-top, almost as if the flavors were made to be bold, but a bit cautious. The unusual and high-end main dish ingredients offered an exciting set of options (foie gras, scallops, duck, filet mignon, truffles, oyster, tuna, rock shrimp, etc.). The biggest drawback for me was portion size as I recall, it was not as large as I had hoped for the price and I didn't walk out feeling entirely \"satisfied\". Entrees are $25-$45 per person while sandwiches are less.   Would I recommend The Gladly? Yes. Really nice atmosphere, great service, high-quality food.  Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to return to give them a second shot at a five star review if I were back in the area.",

The food was excellent for the most part. We tried the brussel sprouts, charcuterie, and chop salad for appetizers. The salad was amazing and totally deserving of its \"famous\" moniker. The combo of Israeli couscous and smoked salmon, as well as the crunch from the freeze dried corn, was phenomenal.   For our mains we got the salmon, chicken, and poke bowl. The lowlight of the meal was the poke, which had a pretty bad fish to rice ratio, though the fish that was present was tasty. The salmon and chicken were both perfectly cooked, and the sides of potatoes and risotto were great.   For dessert we tried the caramel pecan bread pudding, which was as delicious as it was decadent.   The highlight of the meal was actually our amazing server! Always available when we needed him, yet not overbearing, and super affable and friendly. Unfortunately don't recall his name but he was terrific!",

Anyway, came here with a friend after going to the Arabian Horse Show, which we didn't see any horses but saw PLENTY of vendors selling their wares.    We shared the sausage pretzel and cheese and the kimchi wings.   I had the titos martini and my friend had the thai margarita.   The margarita had a ring of thai chili salt(?) around the rim.   Of course, my martinis were perfect.  The pretzel came with a mustard sauce, which was hot enough to clear the sinuses, which means it was good as long as we didn't use too much.   It included cheese cubes and sausage slices (pictured).  The wings were good.   I wouldn't say anything outstanding but good.  Michael was our server.   Very helpful, friendly and professional.  I don't know why I stayed away so long.   I suppose it's cause it wasn't anything to write home about earlier, but I will definitely be back.",

It's in a pretty upscale part of Phoenix and you can feel the ambiance as soon as you walk in. I honestly couldn't tell who the servers were though. In any case once ours introduced himself to us, it was all good. He was very pleasant and helped make our experience there fun.   For starters we got the Brussel Sprouts which came on a bed of grits, and Crab cakes. Absolutely delicious - grits were creamy and smooth; sprouts were perfect. For my meal I got the small order of Parsley Garlic Chicken served on risotto. The skin on the chicken could have been a bit more crisp, but it was seasoned beautifully and the sun dried tomatoes gave it a bit more umph. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Let's start with the place. Beautiful. Open, comfortable. The bar is also great. I was waiting at the bar and saw a lot of people having fondue, very elaborated hand crafted cocktails and having a great time.  When my party arrived we tried several dishes. All of them really good. I was hoping to try the pork belly but nobody voted for that. I'll be back soon to try it, the fondue and the \"super yummy nuts\".  The chopped salad was very good and very unique in flavor and texture.  The duck ramen was tasteful and with a final spicy kick. Just be aware, it's a large serving.   The wild fiji tuna was also very good.  The balsamic meatloaf was original and tasteful but again, be aware, the serving is very large. I would order it without the rice or it would be good a creamy grana padano risotto, but that's just my preference.  My favorite dish was the tomato soup. Hands down.  Bread pudding was tasteful and the smoke tea chocolate pot the creme was pretty unique. I liked it but if you don't like smoky tastes, this is not for you.   A great addition to the neighborhood.  Cheers",

I hear the happy hour is a great spot for singles - haven't check it out myself but my sources are reliable! :)",

This item came with cherry wood smoked pork butt, toasted country bread and Korean pear .  These all went well with the cheese.

    "text": "Let me start with the atmosphere.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by their enthusiastic hostess.  She was very excited to welcome us to their restaurant.  She introduced me to their event planner and thanked me for choosing their restaurant.  She accommodated our group with a very nice booth that was conducive to group conversation.  The atmosphere was Upscale Chic.  There was Eclectic music, a lively bar, and a beautiful patio.  It had that downtown San Francisco Vibe.     Our waitress' name was Kat.  I love a waitress that knows how to sell her product.  She did an excellent job describing the food and recommending drinks to accommodate our variety of tastes.  She even let us sample their house Negroni on tap which contained Aviation gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth.  Our experienced and adventurous girl Vicki immediately wanted to try it, but Kat insisted that she sample it first because she said that it wasn't for everyone.  Turns out she was right, we all sampled it and agreed.  The cocktails were original.  There were several options on the menu that I had never been acquainted with.  I would say their drinks were old school styled with a modern twist.  I personally enjoyed the Bay City Shandy, another recommendation by Kat.  It was our chosen Drink for the Night.   This drink was the perfect blend of sour with just the right amount of kick.  I love my drinks to be fresh and not contain a lot of sugar and this drink definitely exceeded my expectations.  It normally comes on the rocks, but I chose to have it served martini style.  To our surprise, we just happened to be there during Restaurant week.  Several us chose to participate.  The restaurant week special offered a 3 course meal for $33.  I chose the chopped salad, scallops and then the banana bread pudding for dessert.  All 3 were phenomenal.  Several of us had the chopped salad and we all fell in love with it.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, they were tender and flavorful.  The banana bread pudding made the perfect ending to our meal.  It wasn't too heavy, and not too sweet yet simply delicious.  Restaurant week doesn't end until Monday, so if weren't able to make Wednesday, you won't regret trying to make it there to try the special.    I definitely recommend this place if you're looking to experience a cool, relaxed environment with beautiful people and excellent food!  Rating for the Gladly:",

It's grammatically incorrect, there is no such thing as \"the gladly\", and just because you rent a space on Camelback doesn't make it ok.  \"Irregardless\", according to Oxford, is now a word.  Not to me.  2) the BLUE CHEESE STEAK SALAD...is so good, I'm willing to ignore the grammatical error in the restaurant name.  The menu says: \"baby kale & field greens, Point Reyes blue dressing, bourbon soaked cherries, sweet potato chips {gf}$16\".  The amount of steak you receive is generous...and delicious!  Nice bartender, prompt, efficient, I'll go back.  Nice job.",

The location is great, Camelback corridor, surrounded by high rises makes this a great urban restaurant. Parking was convenient.  We were greeted and welcomed as we walked in and immediately seated and made comfortable. Our waiter was quick to follow the host and get us settled. Great welcoming atmosphere for families, couples, blind dates, and groups.   We started with drinks, I got the Thai Margarita and my husband got the Sazerac. Signature cocktails are the bomb for me and these were over the top!! I would have been content to just sit an sip all night but this is a restaurant that does serve food. So we ordered the Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese and again we were pleased. The spicy tomato relish was a wonderful surprise and brought mac and cheese to a whole different level. We could have stopped there but we kept going. We got the Chimichurri Chicken and the Salmon Special. Both dishes were exquisitely prepared and the presentation made us hesitate to dig in and mess it up. Needless to say, we were both content and extremely pleased with our choices. I of course had to have a follow up margarita.     We are looking forward to returning and sitting on the patio as Fall approaches.",

Started with the Thai Margarita, probably the best Margarita I ever had, with a smokiness that cut through a typically overly sweetened drink.  For my meal I had the chilaquiles. They were some of the better I've had. Someone I was with had the rice waffle. She said it was the best waffle she'd ever eaten, and I'd tend to agree. Crisp on the outside, but melted in your mouth on the inside with a solid pineapple something compote.  Our server was lovely. Great with our 1 year old -- something I wasn't really expecting with a place that has a slightly clubby vibe. I imagine that aspect is more noticeable when the sun isn't out.

    "text": "I give this place 4 to 4.5 stars. Menu is a little limited and a little pricey, but that is to be expected. They are catering to their client, I am just not their target. The menu is, in my opinion, better for the sophisticated pallet. It is smaller than I thought it would be. You will find items like duck meatloaf. I ended up getting the burger and having them get rid of most of their creative toppings, switched out the cheese. The burger was good, fries were good. The ketchup was homemade - some people really like that style, I prefer Heinz. The atmosphere of this place is great, that contributes to its overall rating positively. Dress is business attire. I was in jeans and a polo shirt, and felt a little under dressed. Most men were in slacks and sports coat. If I went back I would wear business attire for sure, would fit in better.",

    "text": "A jewel box of a restaurant! I heard good things about The Gladly, so we decided to meet friends for dinner there last night. Until we arrived, I did not realize they had taken over the old Ruth Chris space.  I did know that it was the sister restaurant of Citizen Public House, so I had high expectations.  As the hostess escorted us, past THE AMAZING LOOKING BAR, I wanted to yell, \"Wait, let's just hang out there!\" But arriving at our table, I was not disappointed.  The elevated dining room gives a feeling of privacy, but still allows it's diners to check out what is going on around them.   Cocktails last night were Negroni's On Tap, followed by a bottle of Hearst Ranch Petite Sirah, suggested by our waiter, Tim, and all was good in the world.  Of course, we ordered a couple of The Original Chopped Salads to share. Three orders of Pan Seared Scallops (incredibly sweet and bacon-y) and one order of Coffee Charred Short Ribs, we were an incredibly happy table of diners. An Apple Tartlet and Buttermilk Bread Pudding for dessert was just over the top.  I appreciate that the menu indicates Gluten Free items and was able to help with a dairy intolerance substitution.  All around a great meal and a fun evening.  We will be back!",

    "text": "I have dined at The Gladly two times now, once for Brunch and once for Dinner and both experiences were stellar.  This place has excellent service, a creative and well-developed menu, and great cocktails!    On my last visit for dinner, I had the Duck Meatloaf and it was wonderful !  I am not much of a fan if Duck, but I could be if It always was as good as The Gladly's meatloaf:). In addition, for appetizers we had the Pistachio Chicken Liver Pate and a very yummy Smoked Mozzarella Fondue .....each was a delight!   And kudos to our server who, when taking my drink order for a dirty martini, asked if I wanted blue cheese stuffed olives!  I was so pleasantly surprised that he offered before I asked:). Very nice!  Lastly,  I am headed back to The Gladly for Brunch again today and am so looking forward to the delicious Sorbet Mimosa, and the Pigstrami Hash!    Love this place !",

The server asked if we wanted to have the scallops cooked medium to medium well, because they are served rare. We said medium. They did come out rare. I was okay with it, but my guy doesn't like seafood rare at all.  We also had the short ribs. The flavor was good, but the meat was dry. It really could have used some sauce, and the pecans... (I think it was pecans if I remember right) seemed a bit much on such a heavy dish.  Over all, the service was ok, the curly haired female server did bring us the wrong drinks as well... (on another note, our server with so much hair... I was surprised it was not secured back- just kind of seemed unsanitary) the ambiance is nice- I would come here again and maybe try some different things, before I made a final judgement.",

    "text": "The Gladly - this is it, my favorite new spot. This restaurant hits on so many different cylinders it's ridiculous. First and foremost, I love myself some Citizen Public House. Now with The Gladly being around, it's a conflict on which of the two we should visit when it's up for discussion.  The ambiance inside of The Gladly differs from CPH which is nice, with large glass windows that give it a more elegant vibe - I would argue that CPH is slightly more intimate. Pick your poison, folks. Intimate or elegant - either way it's amazing.   The bar flows similarly as well with the large square seating arrangement - but the whiskey selection at The Gladly is incredible and takes things to the next level. Cocktails are above just about every other restaurant in the area as far as quality, taste, and creativity in my opinion - well done Richie Moe and staff.  Menu selections differ nicely from the Public House offerings but still keep to that inventive, yet classic comfort style of cuisine that I've come to love and appreciate from the sister restaurant.   I cannot recommend The Gladly highly enough. Great cocktails, great food, and great service. Bing, bang, boom - it's all you need.",

The chopped salad lives up to its reputation. It wad so good that I will be experimenting with making this salad in the future. I really enjoyed eating the corn grits, but the Brussels Sprouts were a little too bitter for me.  The duck meatloaf seemed so out of the ordinary that my husband and I just had to get it. It's definitely one of their richer entrees with the cherry glaze and foie gras sauce. The rosemary in the millet was a little overpowering, but when you eat everything together it all came together.  I was pleasantly surprised that our waiter brought out 2 truffles to eat for dessert.  Our waiter Patrick was just all around great!

    "text": "\"I will gladly pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today.\" Or, frankly, anything on the menu from The Gladly, one of the top \"Hot New Restaurants\" to open in Phoenix within the last year.   Formerly the matronly Ruth's Chris Steak House, The Gladly overhauled the old fashioned, frumpy, overpriced steakhouse and enlisted the talents of Chef Bernie Kantak, fun-loving, champion mixologist Richie Moe from sister restaurant Citizen Public House in downtown Scottsdale (near BS West) and a solid, conscientious team.   We happily stopped in The Gladly for lunch to sample their fare. An outstanding appetizer choice is the Pistachio Chicken Liver Pate ($9) served in a petite Mason jar with crostini, sage mustard, pickled onions and capers. The pate is rich and creamy, without the iron-like taste of most livers. If you're not up for the challenge (it is liver, after all), you'll definitely be a fan of the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with creamy sweet corn grits ($10) accented with shaved Pecorino-Romano cheese and truffle oil. Outrageously, madly, fabulous, it's bound to be a staple on The Gladly's seasonally changing menu. It's gluten free, but big deal. Who cares?  Counting carbs? The Blue Cheese Steak Salad ($16) is one of four salads. This salad has generous pieces of tender, juicy, charred Port marinated tenderloin that almost falls apart when you look at it. This all rests on a bed of baby kale, field greens, Point Reyes bleu cheese dressing (ask for extra. Trust me.) bourbon soaked cherries with sweet potato chips.   The B.B.L.T. sandwich--one of five--is stuffed with thick-cut Buckboard Bacon, baby lettuce, tomato, aioli (which seems to be everywhere. Sometimes I just want old fashioned mayonnaise.) on a pretzel roll for $10. Hint: This bacon is thick, giving it a different texture, also imparting a slightly stronger taste than what you're used to. It's not your traditional BLT. Not quite. Word is The Pigstrami ($14) with smoked pork butt, Swiss cheese, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, Dijon mustard on rye is a dream.  Try the Chimichurri Chicken Breast ($14 - half/$24 - full) gives you buttermilk Smart Chicken (that means it's organic and humanely handled) perched on top of a tasty fingerling potato casserole in a mild, creamy chili sauce. A half order is filling.  Some of these dishes appear on the dinner menu. Don't miss out on the \"brunch\" dishes that you can order every day. We hear the Chilaquiles Rojos ($10) are a showstopper.  If you're on a liquid diet, you're absolutely in the right place. Perch yourself at their bar and let the knowledgeable (and dare I say super hot!) Brian Goodwin, the Bar Manager, introduce you to their vast repertoire of speciality cocktails that will stun and amaze you. No kidding. The classics are all there, sure, but try something unique--that's their specialty. The Thai Margarita is Patron Silver tequila, galangal (ginger) and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, basil and lime with Thai chili sea salt on the rim on the rocks gives an Asian spin to this Mexican kicker.  The Gladly features 220 different whiskeys. Play \"Mr. (or Ms.) Big Shot\" and order the \"Isabella:\" Glenlivet Nadurra 16--year Scotch, Martel VSOP Cognac, sweet vermouth, B&B with Peychaud's and Angostura bitters. The crowning touch is when they make a perfect, clear tennis ball sphere of ice out of sushi grade ice before your very eyes (no kidding, it's quite the feat! Especially if Brian makes it. Gun show!) Exquisitely crafted and a Cocktail Bucket List \"Must.\" Worth the $15 splurge. Select Gladly fab-ly cocktails are featured during their happy hour, seven days a week, 3-6 p.m. along with $5 select wines and half-off appetizers & draft beers.  Once a month Chef Bernie creates a six-course dinner, paired with six cocktails for only $75. Get a gaggle of friends and take advantage of this special event. Maybe Brian will make those cocktails, too. Call for details. About the dinner, that is.   You'll be a gadfly at The Gladly. Guaranteed. Go!",

We had reservations and arrived a few minutes early.  We were seated promptly.  We sat in the area of the restaurant they call \"The Library\" which is decorated with paintings of books and a quiet, smaller room overlooking the restaurant - this book-aficionado absolutely loved the ambiance!   The menu:  it was pre-fixed for Valentine's Day, but we still had a good sampling of the foods offered.  For appetizers, the boyfriend had The Original Chopped Salad, which was fantastic. It's so good, it even has it's own facebook page!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheoriginalchoppedsalad&s=7f5444feb9888a82a3ca15ec2ac7422dcb528db57226915f41d40f0c5860e3f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/theoriginal...</a>.   Seriously?!   haha.  I am not a salad person ( I can't eat lettuce) but even so, this is something that I would order in the future.  I had the butternut squash soup, which was warm and flavorful.  I loved the pepitas served on top - a nice, unique AZ style twist.   For dinner, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were sweet and savory, cooked to absolute perfection.  I love scallops and these are definitely some of my favorites!  They were complemented with sweet corn grits, I have never had anything like this before - they were so delicious, I had to refrain from licking my plate!    We wrapped up dinner with some blueberry bread pudding.  I then had to refrain the bf from licking the plate for this dish. haha.  Luckily, we maintained our composure and left with very satisfied bellies. The portions were ample but not huge, the prices were what I would expect for a fancy dinner out on the town at the Biltmore - we call it upper middle-brow dining perhaps?  It's a great place for a special occasion.    Enjoy!",

    "text": "I'm pleased to see that the tech industry's obsession with adverbs has now spilled over into the hospitality industry. Gladly joins the rareified ranks of weebly, optimizely, bitly, and every sub-domain registered in Libya.   True to form they've adopted a semi hispter modern aesthetic, clean cool lines with just a touch of texture here and there and a few potted succulents to bring some life to it all. Coming from Williamsburg, I was a big fan of the interior/ambiance.  Cocktails here also seem to be something you come for. The bartenders all know what they're doing (and probably refer to themselves as mixologists.) The Manhattan was execellent, boozy but sweet enough to be highly drinkable. The Mule was a big winner as well, spruced up with a bit of seasonal herbs that elevated the whole drink quite nicely. I was a little off put by the mixing of multiple high quality whiskeys in one drink, it seemed a little sacriligeous, but I'm sure it's delicious.   Foodwise the big winners were:  The Original Chopped Salad* Seared Spicy Tuna Seared Scallops Duck meat loaf  The seared spicy tuna app, had a mix of sweet, savory, and spicy elements that were just fantastic. Like they should expand this item out into a full blown salad and I would eat the shit out of it.  Scallops were super high quality, large, and the bed of grits really won me over.   The duck meat loaf honestly was just a fancy meatloaf, but it was an incredible amount of food, so if you're going for value this is not a bad choice. I couldn't finish even half of it.  Speaking of value, their happy hour specials here (3-6pm daily) look ridiculous. I'll definitely have to come back for that. As well, seating on a Friday night at 7pm wasn't an issue, so that's always nice.  *The originality of this chopped salad seems to be a point of local debate, which I have no interest in entering into. So I'll just point that out and promptly exit the debate.",

Simply wonderful. I am trying really hard to cut back on red meat, so the fact that they have this is great in and of itself.  I also had the chop salad, and its legendary status is well deserved.   The waiter was very friendly. We did not have to wait for drink re-fills, or to get the check.   All in all, it was a great experience. Thinking about returning for restaurant week this year.",

The menu is not extensive, but it offers unique choices for just about everyone. We started with the field greens salad and the wedge. Both were delicious. Our mains were the filet mignon, duck meatloaf, and the sea bass. All were excellent. The entire staff was very attentive, and worked together to ensure a wonderful evening.

Not sure of our waiters name but we sat on the patio (Friday night) and only stayed there because it was too loud Inside. And It was 50 degrees outside. Like I said I did not catch his name since he never introduced himself but he had bleached hair on top.  He never offered us suggestions or mention of if there were any specials. He took our drink order and disappeared for 20 minutes. He continued to disappear after each order i.e. Appetizer then main course.  Never ever once asked if we wanted additional drinks or refills. Made me feel that our table was not important.  We ordered the chopped salad  (had it at Citizens) and knew it would be good. We order also orders the steak salad which was meh for $18 steak was like a thick beef jerky. For dinner we ordered chimichurri  chicken and scallops which were good. At the end of the meal when the tab was paid our waiter had the audacity to stand there and count his tip in front of us. He got his 15-20%! Entire experience was awkward and because of this do not recommend nor would return to the Gladly.  Happy holidays!!",

A recent occurrence happened this weekend when I showed up five minutes early for my 830pm reservations and was finally seated at a table at 850pm. The accommodating hostess did present us with two glasses of rose, but when we sat down, we realized we weren't that special because everyone else around us were also served complimentary rose...   The meal was off to a decent start with the lamb riblettes and paprika cured pork belly. The glaze on the riblettes was slightly sweeter than my palette likes, but the flavor on the lamb was really wonderful. I was surprisingly pleased with the pork belly. I have gotten to the point where I swore off pork belly for so long because no one knew how to 'wow' with it. A fatty piece of pork can do well on its own, but I like to think the kitchen tried, and the staff here did an awesome job. I had also never had sarga turo, and really enjoyed it with the pork belly and golden beets. We were again slightly disappointed when a new couple sat next to us and was advised of a drink and entree special for the night that our server neglected to tell us.  The most disappointing part of the meal was the main course. We both ordered fish for our main since we had red meat for our appetizers. The yellowtail looked very dry as it was sat on the table, and its texture was the same. The chilled tuna was slightly better, but unimpressive.  My date later pointed out that the yellowtail served to our neighboring table was both cooked and plated much better.   I feel like this place has a lot of potential, but definitely has more room for improvement. I may give it another go, but I'd have to be convinced it can be done better next time.",

I stumbled upon The Gladly and saw they had pretty much the most extensive whiskey list I've ever seen at a restaurant, not to mention the great reviews.  My boyfriend and I love whiskey so I made a reservation on the spot.   First impressions ranging from the decor to the mood lighting to the staff was exceptional. Our table was about 10 minutes past due but we didn't mind as we were hanging out at the bar enjoying ourselves and relaxing. The boyfriend had the Gladly Manhattan and it was probably one of the best Manhattan's we've ever had.  Delish!  They were running a Restaurant Week special which included an appetizer, entree and dessert for $30.  This was a phenomenal deal as one entree would cost you about $30 alone.  Done!  I ordered the Caesar salad, Chimichurri Chicken (which was perfectly cooked and so tender), and the White Chocolate Blondie for dessert.  Everyone at our table ordered something different and they all had nothing but great things to say about their food.  We had a little family style dinner going on as we all wanted to try what the other had.  Definitely not disappointed by any of the dishes, including the special \"Pickled Pork Temple\" dish that our friend ordered at the behest of our waiter who was so lively and friendly!   This restaurant was a fantastic choice for a birthday dinner and we will absolutely be back for more!  Thank you The Gladly for providing such a great atmosphere; the food, drinks and service was incredible!",

Their menu is very different than Public House, but they keep the same ideas and of course they kept the classic chop salad, which is my all time favorite.   The food here is really good - I have yet to try some of the interesting dishes on the menu, but can't wait!",

We were there on a slow Saturday afternoon and they treated us like we were the only ones there.  Food was great and their drinks were good.  The bar inside is very cool and they have a lot of interesting stuff.  This would be a good place to sit at the bar and pick the bartender's brain about booze.",

    "text": "The Gladly is located on the SE corner of Camelback and 22nd street. Happy Hour here is from 3-6pm and it has a great menu. We went here at around 5:10 on a Wednesday. It was not very busy. My waitress was a female, I can't remember her name but she was extremely knowledgeable about every item of the menu and could name off all the ingredients to whatever we ordered by memory. I arrived about 20 minutes before my boyfriend and she checked on me often. Service was fast; I don't know how they got our food out within 5 minutes of ordering. I ordered the Happy Hour cocktail. It had a unique taste with chili flakes sprinkled around the rim. I can't remember all the ingredients but it had a little orange juice in there. I also ordered the pistachio chicken liver pate which was incredible for only $6. It came in a little jar and the lid held the capers and pickled onions. It spread on the baguettes very smoothly and had just enough of a chicken liver taste for me to love it. I also had a glass of Rose which on the Happy Hour menu was only $5 He ordered the Smoked chicken wings with blue cheese dressing. I tried one, they were ok, I prefer hot wings. The bleu cheese was not the best I've ever had either. It could have used some bigger chunks in it. The Brussel sprouts were sooo good, every time I put a forkful in my mouth I said \"mmmm\". They came on top of grits that were creamy and delicious. On the Happy Hour menu the sprouts were $5 For our finale we chose the Banana Creme Jar which came with 2  peanut butter cookies. It was awesome and tasted like Banana pudding with a little hint of a nutty after taste! This dessert was $10 and was the only thing that we ordered that was not on the Happy Hour menu. I would go back here to try the chopped salad, the table in front of us had that and it looked really good. This place regular menu is a little expensive so make sure you go during Happy Hour for the great deals. Our check came to less than $50 including 20% tip.",

We could not have been more pleased and heartily recommend The Gladly for anyone planning a party.  Robin was great and helped me through every step of the planning.  We chose the Hunter menu and everyone enjoyed the varied dinner options the Hunter provided, especially the scallops and the short ribs.  Having our own bar in the room also really made a difference.  Everyone was really comfortable placing their own drink order with the bar tender rather than waiting for a server to return from the restaurant proper with their drink.  In total - the room is great, the food is great, and the service beyond compare!!  Five stars for Robin and The Gladly!!",

From service to food to drinks, this place has it all.  Our waiter was great and made recommendations since we were first timers. I got Feast or Famine for mh drink whjch was delicious-- tastes like a spicy cider! Then for my appetizer I got the crab cakes, which were moist & flavorful. Lastly, I ordered the chopped salad & was skeptical at first, but hands down best salad! It has the right amount of everything in there from crunchy to sweet and the salmon makes a treat.  Definitely will be going back!",

The hostess was delightfully friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable on the menu and easy to converse with. She was also very diligent in keeping up with our needs. The manager made her rounds and checked in on all the diners, she let us know that nearly everything is made in house, even at one point the ketchup!  I have to say the food was outstanding. We started with the pretzel sausage cheese plate which rivaled some of the better cheese boards we've had at a fraction of the cost. We had their unique sorbet mimosa which was strong and sweet! I then had the delight of eating the gluten free churro waffle (which blows my mind that a specialty dish would be gluten free) it was amazing! Perfect mix of savory sweet and spicy! My dining partner let me sample her grits and it tasted like a symphony of corn and butter!   I was crushed when I realized this place is 6 hours from my house, but next time I'm in Phoenix I will be running back!",

    "text": "If you're a tourist, this place is really a no brainer and one of those must go-to places.  Actually, even if you're a local, you should go, and especially if you just want a well-crafted drink.  It is always a little surprising to see a 4.5+ star restaurant with hundreds of reviews, it makes me wonder just how good that place really is.  And I always secretly hope the place will amaze and dazzle my taste buds in a manner of which I have not previously experienced.  So I would like to thank The gladly for doing precisely that.  First and foremost, the service is spectacular, the staff is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their dishes.  Now onto the food which made the cut:  CHOPPED SALAD - sounds boring, chopped salad, who wants that... well you do, you just don't know it yet.   CHICKEN LIVER PATE - a heaping portion good enough for 2-4 served with house made mustard  CONFLAGRATION NATION - just spot on, the perfect amount of peatiness, a good smokey flavor, smooth yet bold, made by one of the bartenders for a DC competition, this drink is a must (also one of their most expensive cocktails).  Honestly though, the food was around a 3.5 to 4 stars as I was not a huge fan of the main dishes, but the appetizers, dessert, service, and drinks are 6 stars which gives this place an overall score of 5 stars!  I was waited upon by Tim, fantastic guy but it looks like all of the staff are top notch here so you probably can't go wrong.  TIP: Happy hour daily 3-6pm & all day Sunday: half off draft beers, and a few appetizers including the famous chopped salad  TIP2: The outdoor patio seating area is fantastic, call ahead to see if you can reserve a table there.",

    "text": "The Gladly is among my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. The ambiance makes you feel like you are inside a spacious pub, but it is nowhere near as noisy as a typical pub or bar, meaning you can actually communicate with those seated across from you at the table. The cocktails are great, and this is one of the better places in town to get an Old Fashioned.   They have a large selection of bourbon on tap if you are a fan. I have never been disappointed by any of the cocktails I have ordered. I highly recommend the spherical ice balls because 1) it is neat to watch their creation in the Japanese press and 2) $1 is donated to the Ryan House (a local hospice) with every ice ball purchased.  The Original Chopped Salad is an excellent starter, the wedge salad is another good choice. I could probably go to The Gladly and just order the salad. That said, the burger leaves something to be desired. Some of the other entrees are much better such as the filet or the pan seared seabass. The sea scallops are delicious but won't fill you up if you have a big appetite.",

    "text": "We decided to return to The Gladly when we saw it on the list for Restaurant Week. Since we had an awesome experience the first time we were there, we of course had very high expectations! I had made us reservations for the night so we were seated promptly upon arrival. I remembered receiving large portions the last time we dined & they had a pre-fixed meal so I was contemplating whether or not to go for the $33 three course meal or rather just order an entree .. After browsing the menu, I thought sure, why not! Three course away.  I had gotten a Moscow Mule previously & thought it was rather refreshing so I got the one this time as well. It was the Orange mule - very good! My date ordered a Japanese Whiskey on the rocks & enjoyed that. If you're a whiskey drinker this is definite the place for you as they have a huge selection!  For our food, my date & I both started with the Original Chopped Salad. It was just like last time - very good, although I wished mine had more of the crunchy dried corn on it! I ordered the Chimichurri Chicken for my main meal & my date ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. The chicken had nice crust on it but was a little bit on the dry side. The potatoes were a nice addition on the dish & probably the saving grace. The scallops were okay, a little bit on the squishy side almost like they should've been cooked longer (but my date had asked for them to be medium rare) & the portion size felt much smaller than the chicken. I was pretty full after eating only about three-fourths of my meal but was excited for dessert.  This was probably the biggest disappointment. Firstly, when our desserts arrived, we realized we had no silverware to eat them with & enough time passed that my date got up and found someone to get us spoons. I had gotten the Banana Caramel Bread Pudding & my date got the Chocolate Tart. I'm a HUGE fan of bread pudding and was so let down by how dry this one was. It had a sauce drizzled on it but I didn't find that it was enough and it lacked any kind of banana flavor. The tart on the other had was good; it was very rich and the ice-cream was a tad too salty but if I had to pick again, I would've probably went with the tart.  Overall, for the price, I felt this experience was disappointing. The service wasn't as good & the food just seemed to be lacking the pizazz it had last time. It'll be a while before we return, if at all.",

I mean the Original Chopped Salad. Prior to my first Gladly visit, I did not do my research and was upset thinking the recipe for what may be one of the most epic salads ever created was copied! But alas! To my relief, it was not. I merely followed the same delicious food right to The Gladly where Chef Kantak continues to create memorable food, (and apparently Citizen Public House too - another \"go-to\" for me)!  Both times I've been here, the service was great! I went with a friend on a Friday for lunch and it was busy, and the only seats outdoors was the patio couch with a coffee table, but we were happy to chill on the couches and relax. Brandi, our server, was cheerful and very attentive the entire time. As busy as it was, we never felt rushed and enjoyed catching up while eating.  This past Friday, another friend and I tried the happy hour. We arrived at an off time of 3:30pm so we had the entire patio to ourselves at first. Our server Phillip was like a comedian commenting how fancy of us to reserve the whole patio! The patio was shaded around this time of day so it wasn't too hot just yet as temperatures are starting to climb steadily. Big surprise, my friend and I ordered our own discounted HH Original Chopped Salads. We also ordered the Sausage, Pretzel, Cheese appetizer and the Smoked chicken wings with blue cheese dressing. The pretzel bread had the perfect texture and flavor and stood up well to the spicy cheese served with it. The sausage was oily and decadent as expected from rich deli meat. As far as the wings go, the blue cheese dressing is what brought out the flavor of the seasoned wings.   The cocktail I enjoyed during happy hour was a perfect summer drink. It was Jameson whiskey with ouzo foam on top and garnished with citrus - very refreshing!",

We arrived around noon on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't packed, but definitely full. They were offering the happy hour menu at that time, which is always a plus! We got the following:   The original chopped salad - 5/5: BEST chopped salad I've EVER had!! The mixture of textures was great on the palate (loved the frozen dried corn); the couscous was a unique and pleasant touch and the homemade buttermilk dressing was light, refreshing and flavorful!   The brussel sprouts with pecornio cheese - 2/5: I'm a big fan of brussel sprouts and I've had my fair share. In comparison to other brussel sprout dishes, I thought these lacked flavor and weren't cooked very well. Thought the brussel sprouts themselves were a little hard and the bulk of the flavor was coming from the bits of pecorino cheese.   Chilaquiles - 3/5: Let me tell you - if you are not a fan of spicy food, STAY AWAY from this dish. I asked for a side of hot sauce with the chilaquiles, and did not need one drop of it! The dish is spicy on its own, and I actually needed to drink some water with it. I'm a fan of spicy food, so I enjoyed it, however it may not be for everyone. It was a bit too saucy for my taste, but I did like the that the chips were extra crispy. I've had much better before and probably wouldn't order this dish again when I go back.   The service was great! Everyone was very friendly and we enjoyed our experience :) The 4/5 is essentially for the BEST chopped salad I've had and the friendly service!",

Really great atmosphere, they have a great selection of wines, beer, cocktails and whiskey and the food was delicious! I started off by ordering a Moscow mule which was amazing. Probably one of the best I've tasted so far. For the food my fiance ordered the Ribeye special which came with two grilled corn on the cob and potato salad. The ribeye was cooked medium rare, the potato salad was not to mushy and the potatoes had a nice taste. I was debating between  the duck meatloaf and their original chopped salad but ended up going with the salad. I felt that if their salad has its own Facebook page, the food must be worth checking out. The salad was smaller then what I expected but surprisingly very filling . The salad has corn, couscous, smoked salmon, Asiago, pepitas, tomatoes,  arugula and currants served with a buttermilk pesto dressing. I loved the vibrant colors of the salad and its definitely makes for a great photo of the dish. The servers will mix the salad right in front of you or you can choose to mix it yourself. The only thing that would make the salad better is if they added more smoked salmon.  Overall the service was amazing. Our server was very attentive and didn't rush us. She answered any questions we had and she comped my drink since it was my birthday. ( it was unexpected and I appreciate it) .The food was delicious and I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. I'll definitely be back to try some more food !   Tip: if you're coming with a large group, they can use up to four cards to split the bill.",

But that's about all the good things I can say. We came in with a group of 14. We asked for four separate checks for our group. We were told by management that they did not offer Separate Checks. I explain to the manager that one of the couples in the group was only ordering appetizers and another group of four within our party of 14 was all ordering steaks I asked if it was a single Bill if we could just divide up what we owed and pay with credit card and he confirmed that that would be fine. When the bill came the waitress informed us that we could split the bill equally into four payments but not different amounts. At this point things got a little uncomfortable as we call for management again to straighten this mess out. This created a very unpleasant atmosphere in addition too much stress amongst our group the staff and management at this restaurant totally wrecked our evening by not being able to easy comply what has become very much the standard and restaurants by providing Separate Checks. With the current computer systems that are employed and restaurants it's very easy to designate what each customer is having an a sign that to a check their refusal to do this was very much ridiculous. I have not been to an establishment in over 10 years that refused Separate Checks. Ultimately after much discussion they agreed to separate checks but at that point the night was wrecked. None of us will ever return nor will we ever recommend this establishment. In addition the service was very slow and the waitress had a slight attitude the whole night. Overall a very disappointing night.",

Their cocktail menu is fantastic and our waiter was very knowledgeable on the drinks.  For example, 'The Fortified Fig' -- gin, port and fig syrup - WOW!!!  They also do the large round ice cubes at your table -- very cool to watch.  The smoked cheese fondue was fantastic.  Crab cakes -- incredible amount of crab.  Pork chop with chile bread pudding -- amazing.  Filet -- perfect medium rare.  Our dessert wasn't on the menu -- tres leche apple cake with mascarpone ice cream -- wow.

The interior is beautiful and welcoming with an impressive-looking bar. Our server (I think his name was Damian) was also really nice and chatted with us a bit. I ordered a chicken sandwich that was excellent. The side salad was delicious too. I think it came with arugula and had walnuts. The only thing I didn't like about it was the basalmic vinaigrette dressing because it was a little too much. Otherwise, everything was absolutely excellent!",

The chopped salad was good, as was the burrata, and the service. But overall, a huge disappointment, and doubtful if The Gladly deserves a second chance.",

I am especially pleased with the location in the Camelback corridor.   The interior is light, open and modern. Acoustically, it isn't bad, and we thought it was ok for our large group.  The cuisine is modern American- great favorites (i.e. meatloaf) updated for 2013+  I had the Coffee Charred Short Ribs, and they were every bit of savory and delicious. My dining companion had the scallops, which were also delicious.   The bar is impressive and True to Citizen Public House fashion, the bartender was able to whip up great concoctions.   For Dessert: we had the Smoked tea chocolate de Creme (chocolate pot): smoked tea was an interesting twist, and I would GLADLY order it again.",

I've been here for cocktails, and the drinks were very good with proper balance, the snacks also very satisfying.   Another visit we came in for brunch. It was not good. Their brunch menu is very limited, nothing on their menu sounded appetizing. I went with the Brioche French toast, apparently that means a couple pieces of sad looking bread buried underneath a 12 ounces of blueberry jam. Or something along those lines. It's like it was prepared by a 4 year old. I attempted to take a couple bites, but it just wasn't happening. That dish is inedible, so i left hungry.   But maybe brunch isnt their thing, their service is adequate and i don't dislike the gladly, maybe someone will trick me into going again for dinner one evening.",

This is our go-to restaurant and there's never been a misstep.  The Gladly chicken liver pate and a Manhattan is my ultimate palate and comfort combo.   Small plates are innovative and there are some not to miss dinner entree options esp if you love scallops or filet. But what really gets me is the duck meatloaf. Meatloaf at a restaurant this great is a standard on the menu for a reason!   Sunday brunch is leisurely and delicious. Lunch sandwiches and salads are colorful and filling. Happy hour? yes, please! Dinner is always a singular treat.   Either go with enough people to try a lot of the menu or go often. Sit on the dog-friendly patio if it's prime Phx weather or inside for a great urban vibe. Prepare to feel cared for by the convivial staff and leave satisfied.",

It was buzzing at lunch time with their signature light fare and new-American preparation.  I tried a couple of items:  1. Signature Chop Salad: (5 stars) The hype is well earned; this salad is complex, delicious, and not overbearing.  There is a lot going on between the pumpkin seeds, quinoa, delicious dressing and greens. I Facebook friended it after the meal (this salad actually has its own Facebook page)  2. Brussels Sprouts Appetizer (5 stars): Again, these were awesome.  Not fried like I typically find, or heavily infused with meat, they were truffle-oiled and served on a corn puree.

Service was good--and the servers were really nice, too, so we all were happy.  Nice place, nice area...worth a try for sure.

Seriously. Definitely a restaurant that is appropriate for large groups, intimate dates, and treating family/friends - great atmosphere to be social (without being too loud), wonderful service, and terrific food.  Food:   In short, the food is excellent. Impressive menu with enough variety without being too extensive.  At dinner we ordered: -Smoked Mozzarella Fondue - The flavors complemented each other nicely. Heavy dish but a group favorite. -Pistachio Chicken Liver Pate - Touted by our waiter as being on a recent \"MUST EAT IN Phoenix\" list...it was quite good. Creative. (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Frestaurants%2Fphotos%2F11-must-try-dishes-in-phoenix.html&s=089a008836938e6d24a85ac3428215a4249748cdb3fab82ae9dd308fb92758e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodnetwork.com/restaura...</a>) -Hillbilly Egg Roll - Delicious BBQ, but a bit dry and lacked any accompanying sauce -Corn Dog - A specialty of the evening that also included Little Miss BBQ. Large appetizer and was excellent. Very flavorful. -The Original Chopped Salad - I am not one for ordering salads at dinner, but this was terrific. The Original Chopped Salad is dried corn, Israeli couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula and currants.  Great combination. Very unique. - Roasted Brussels Sprouts - Excellent. Creamy. Group favorite. - Shiitake Braised Short Ribs (roasted acorn squash, black kale, gorgonzola, pecans, fig-raisin relish)....YUM. It was unfortunately overcooked, but I will order this again when I return to this restaurant. Large portion size. - Chocolate Caramel Tart - Beyond GOOD. Great balance between salty and sweet.  Service:  Our waiter was excellent - charismatic, personable, and very honest (and accurate) with his restaurant recommendations. Made for a great evening. Much appreciated.  Overall, The Gladly is a gem of a restaurant in Phoenix. Check it out.",

Yesterday, Chef Bernie Kantak posted an incredible picture of the two wash ranch chickies that he had in the smoker.  Unfortunately (tongue firmly planted in cheek), shortly following that, Chef Donnie Hawk added his  open faced lobster sandwich - potato chips, creme fraiche, house made brioche.  To say that Peg and I enjoyed 4th anniversary week at The Gladly would be a gross understatement.  The chopped salad (aka OMFG chopped salad...with its own FBpage....seriously) has been killin' it for almost 20 years.  It never gets tired and the flavors are always amazingly balanced.  The appetizer of grilled shrimp wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with hazelnut was another  one of Chef Hawk's moments. The Gladly ramped up a bit when the raw bar was added.  Bernie baked a ricotta  and pecan tart that was just amazing....andi it straddled the savory/sweet line well.  BTW, it is dessert meant to be shared. Tim was our server and, nostalgically, he was the 1st server that we had when it opened 4 years ago.  He hasn't missed a beat and still considers people that he helps to be very important people for the business.  I know that everyone has their favorites, and Chef Bernie is one of those people that you follow anywhere.  Happy anniversary, The Gladly and its staff!  Dr. B",

Prior to dinner we hung out at the bar and sampled some happy hour fare.    Happy hour is a great deal.  They have a few apps in the $5-10 range and several drink specials including $2.50 drafts which is a great deal.  We had the sausage, cheese, and pretzel platter which was a perfect app to start out with.  The food is tasty here and I don't recall trying anything I didn't enjoy.  It is a little pricey (normally - not during restaurant week or at happy hour) and the atmosphere leaves a little something to be desired but it is definitely worth trying out if you're in the area.",

The servers are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about all things in the menu and give great suggestions on food items. Needless to say the service is great and when taking a date it helps to make the experience memorable.",

    "text": "We dined at the Gladly lastnight. Excited to try something, \"NEW\" from this already trusted restaurant group I have to say we were pretty disappointed. I'll start by saying that the ambiance was great. Not too loud, just the right amount of hustle an bustle you expect from a trendy new place. We started at the bar for a cocktail after the hostess who was very polite and courteous let us know it would be about 10 minutes. The bartender was very personable and was smiling and helpful with questions regarding a couple cocktails I was interested in. I ordered the Farmers Punch and it was exceptional, well shaken and balanced. We also had the Sazerac and it too was very good.The hostess approached shortly after we got our drinks and indicated which table she would be taking us to and asked if that was ok which it was. After we were seated we were greeted by Tim who was great! Very professional and clearly good at his job as well as with people. The not so great part of the night was the menu. We were sad to see that the menu was virtually the same as CPH. Same proteins with the prep and platings switched up does not a new menu make. We started with the Mac & Cheese as it's one of my faves from CPH and we also had the Ahi Tuna which was a different menu item that we loved, great flavor combinations and so unexpected, Kudos on this one Chef. I ordered the chicken breast as it was a different preparation but when it came to the table it was overcooked and dry. Tim immediately took care of it and I ordered thed crab cakes instead, did not like the GF prep on these the millet gives a not so great aftertaste. My date had the coffee charred short ribs and they were good but not outstanding, again better at CPH.   The new and different items just didn't stand out among the rest of the familiar menu.  In essence the menu and flavor profiiles did not take me to a NEW restaurant. I truly feel this is just CPH Biltmore and we live much closer to CPH so we will save the drive.",

We had tickets to a show downtown at 7:30 so I thought a 5:30 reservation would give us plenty of time.  Wrong!  Our waiter was way more concerned with pushing ice balls than in ensuring our table was served.  Three tables turned while we sat there.  They had different waiters, but ours was doing table side drink balls all over the restaurant.  I will give The Gladly another chance and hope that last night's service was an anomaly.  If this new fad is so popular, I hope they figure out a new service method.",

Their wonderful cobb salad is so unique and as a nondrinker, the bartender whipped up a wonderful, original fruit drink that was so refreshing!  Everyone's food was terrific - we had scallops, fish, steak, short ribs, salads and although I didn't eat the rum cake that was served, it disappeared in a second.  I love coming here - wish I had gotten our server's name as she was great - service was attentive and prompt without any hovering.  The best meal out I've had in a looooong time!!",

Had Brussels sprouts and they were absolutely delicious. Our server, Tim, was very knowledgeable, and made great suggestions. Overall, this has turned into one of our favorite spots.",

I had the seasonal moscow mule, refreshing and slightly sweet, exactly what I wanted.  My wife got the 'into the fold' and later the thai margarita.  She enjoyed them both.  Next was the original chopped salad and butternut squash soup.  The salad was amazing.  Upon first sight, doesn't look like anything special.  But the taste and texture was amazing.  I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon, but the small pieces in the salad gave it a 'bacon' like flavor.  Soup was simple yet delicious.  For the main entree, my wife had the pan seared scallops, you can't go wrong with that.  I had the duck meatloaf with foie gras mousseline.  It reminded me of a hearty Chinese pressed duck dish that I loved from a restaurant in San Jose, so I really enjoyed it.  Service was great.  We will be back.",

    "text": "Firstly the atmosphere and service were outstanding. This is definitely a 3-dollar sign place, pretty pricey. I did get 3 drinks, but my bill was $70, for one person. I've never paid that before, and have to say the food and drinks didn't measure up. The small plate ahi was pretty good, my friend didn't like it. I got the fuzz drink and disliked it a lot. The Mac and cheese was pretty plain, I never understand why they don't bake it to get the crusty top. I only ate a few bites so I could take it home and pop it in the oven to make it better. My friend got the caesar salad which she thought was only okay. My other friend got the burger and loved it. We also got the small octopus dish and none of us liked it. Way too chewy. Overall the food was okay, but definitely not what I was expecting for that price. Would come back only for drinks because of the atmosphere. And I didn't like any drink I tried, so only for champagne.",

Other beers and drinks are great! The food though, is not wonderful. The nuts are always fab.  Fish tacos are just alright.  Overpriced for what you get.   Did not enjoy the tiny cup of butternut squash soup. The texture of the pepitas, and the other ingredients in there made it good. But the overall sweetness of it made it just alright.  The  quinoa  and kale salad is okay.  The eggplant sandwich was tasty but I didn't enjoy trying to eat it as a sandwich. The bread is way too chewy for that. Too much to try to deal with as a sandwich. There's only one slice of eggplant. It was green, and not really flavorful. The cheese was really nice. It was just too much to deal with as a \"sandwich\".  We probably will not ever be back for food. But we like it for the drinks. We used to go there a lot when it was Ruth's Chris. We like the remodel.",

It was a wonderful bread pudding, with vanilla ice cream and blueberry compote on top.  yumm.  Oh, we both had decided on fish tacos and they were awesome, too.  We didn't care for their jazzed up version of ketchup, so we asked for some ranch for the french fries and the waiter was very accomodating . . . it was, of course, not your regular ranch dressing.  Some kind of cilantro ranch, I think, but it was amazing!  The only negative would be the parking, but that wasn't bad enough to mark them down a star.  :)  We loved it there.",

The pork belly appetizer was good, while smoked chicken wing appetizer wasn't anything special...but the entrees are what you come here for -- the duck meatloaf was yummy (though the portion size is ginormous), and the Nutella short rib is out-freaking-standing! The short rib, especially, was so perfectly cooked and so perfectly balanced, we couldn't get enough of it! Nice wine list, too, with some reasonably marked-up options. Lemon-verbena bar wasn't outstanding, but we finished it. One ding that Hubby had for the place, though, is that the menu is way to similar to Citizen Public House -- if you're going to repeat a winning menu in a different locale, just call it CPH 2 so people know it's the same gig. But we'll be back, for sure.",

You feel walking through the door that you might be in store for something special.  And for us it delivered with great service, and well executed dishes with unique twists to classic dishes.    The service was first class as well.  I like dhow we entered awkwardly through the back but the front of the house immediately identified us and came up to greet us.  Nice touch!    Their signature chop salad is worth going there for alone.  I would have liked a full explanation but their philosophy of the restaurant is tied into the salad.  Must get more on that next time.  But it was probably one of the best if not most interesting presentations for a salad.  And just very appealing to the eye.  It ate just as well!  I ordered the duck meatloaf.  Why?  Because when someone offers you duck meatloaf you should take it.  I did.  And it was spectacular.  Juicy and moist with a wonderful sauce. And not gamey tasting if you are wondering but the duck did come through.  I don't mined the gamier more ducky tasting dishes but this one was nice to get a more subtle duck flavor.   Wife had chicken with a pan sauce that was perfectly cooked, juicy and sauce went well.   Desert we had a samplig of chocolate cake and a banana bread pudding that hit big time.",

    "text": "Came here for restaurant week with some friends and every one of us were glad we made the decision to come here! I got the pan-seared scallops on corn grits with the chopped salad and bread pudding! I also had the pleasure in trying the chimichurri chicken, scallop chowder, short ribs, mozzarella fondue and chocolate flourless torte, in addition to 4 different whiskys. Every thing was really good except for the fondue and bread pudding. I could have done without, but everything else was amazing! Our waitress (Courtney) was a doll, she was so nice and helpful! With drinks, the bill wasn't cheap but def worth the experience. I'm a whisky fan so this place holds an extra special place in my foodie heart.",

Only the best Manhattan I've ever had served up with a toasted orange peel for an incredible aroma and a luxardo cherry (a plain maraschino will never suffice again)  The appetizers: smoked mozzarella fondue (the pork butt and pear are the perfect pairings)  The salads: the original chopped salad- enough has been said about this, it's amazing, enough said.   The small plates: the roasted brussels sprouts.. Wow the corn grits and pecorino make this dish standout   Entrees: the scallops, duck meatloaf, short ribs, and filet mignon are all delicious  And on top of all the amazing food options the service has never been less than stellar. I highly recommend for any occasion.",

It is located in a business building and has multiple ways to enter so all you have to do is take your pick. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Its clean, fashionable interior design has great light exposure from the large windows. Came here for Mother's Day brunch. They had a small menu with few extra items for Mother's Day but other than that, menu items mostly came from their usual menu. The food was pretty tasty, particularly their french toast. Portion sizes were appropriate as well. Given the location and type of clientele they cater, pricing was average but service was below average.",

Unfortunately the food just wasn't that good.  We shared the chopped salad which was the highlight. If you have ever been to Cowboy Ciao, it is the same as there.   The entrees seemed like they were trying to be too creative or something, the flavors just didn't quite come together. I had the chimichurri chicken which was served with sort of garnish on top which I ended up scraping off because there was so much of it and it was overpowering. The side of fingering potatoes could have been cooked for longer. My date had a salmon dish which I sampled, it was okay, the salmon was a little bland but not offensive. The side of leek risotto had a really weird taste.  I'd come back again to lounge around and enjoy the atmosphere and drinks, probably not for dinner.",

    "text": "Dinner for 7.  - Ambiance (5/5) Upscale, romantic feel, which by the way, is a total surprise considering the sort of doctor's office feel you have as you walk through the office lobby.    - Service (5/5) Quick, attentive, and table side ice ball making?  Heck yes.    - Beginner's Luck Cocktail, $12 (5/5) Great whiskey drink.  Not the best cocktail I've had, but I admit, I stared so much at that beautifully clear, round ice ball, that I just had to love this drink.    - Smoked Mozzarella Fondue, $11 (4/5) The fondue itself was pretty good, and the bread and pork bits were all great bites.  The Korean pear on the other hand kind of felt like an artist pushing a little far past creative boundaries.  - Chopped Salad, $13 (5/5) Signature dish, and it showed.  How good could chopped salad be, I thought to myself?  Wow, crazy good.  All the different textures, the layers of flavor...  mmm I will dream of this chopped salad.    - Pan Seared Scallops, $30 (4/5) Perfectly cooked scallops.  Loved the bacon bits.  The grits were good, though I couldn't necessarily tell they were corn grits.  And the cola gastrique, while flavorful, was probably a bit too copious for the dish.  A lighter drizzle would have been appropriate.    - Apple Bourbon Bread Pudding, $10 (5/5) Wow!  Mmmm, warm toasty apples with bread pudding that's not all mushy and a bit reminiscent of a pie?  Yes, sign me up over and over.    - Value (4/5) Pretty good value I'd have to say.  I found the scallops to be slightly overpriced, but everything else was great.  - Final Word I always say my 5's had a standout I won't soon forget.  The Gladly has a few: the table side ice ball, the chopped salad, and the bread pudding.  No significant errors and 3 standouts make this a no-brainer in my book.",

No I will say that the Little Miss BBQ brisket egg rolls, known as the hillbilly egg rolls I believe, you're awesome. Taking a local favorite like Little Miss BBQ and adding it to your menu is a genius move. The rest of the food however was good but not great. The service was very good, and the location and atmosphere are great. I would go here again but at this point it would not be my first choice. With so many great places in the area and up the central Corridor, I would be inclined to try something new or go back to one of my favorites.",

I was told repeatedly that the original Gladly salad was the best salad known to man, my girlfriend and her mom couldn't stop talking about it so I had to try this myself. It was a nice afternoon lunch w/ my gorgeous lady and her saint of a mother, and what do you know? They tell me to give the salad a try, I order it, I see the most caring waiters come out with 2 huge plates filled with rows of delicious goodness, and once they asked \"would you like me to mix your salad?\" I knew that this salad had to be the real deal. After my first bite, an instant flavor-gasm rushed to my mouth. I will most certainly eat here again.",

    "text": "I've taken my out of town visitors to this restaurant on several occasions, and each time it has been an eye opening experience. During the day, the restaurant is always quiet, clean, and highly organized. The indirect lighting penetrates their large windows at ease, and the brown-white interior adds both formality and definition to the modern outlook. It's a great place for lunch and small gatherings. I was thankful for fellow Yelpers Greg and Esther N. for coming to see me in Phoenix as we met here for early lunch.  The Super Yummy Nuts ($4) came with spiced and smoked almonds, cashews, and peanuts. The nuts were glazed and crystalized together with hints of spiced and smoked subtleties. This dish was a little expensive, but a fun item to have at the table.  The Butternut Squash Soup ($8) came with gorgonzola, currant relish, and pepitas. It had a thick creamy consistency to couple with a full-on butternut squash flavor. The bites of raisins and pumpkin seeds also added depth and texture. This little cup of soup can go a long way. I would love to have this again.  The Original Chopped Salad with Seared Tuna ($18), also known as the \"State Salad\", came with couscous, dry-freeze corn, arugula, raisins, seeds, tomato, seared tuna, and buttermilk dressing. This is one of their signature dishes. The tuna was nicely seared to go with rich and diverse representations of colors, flavors, and sharp and crisp textures. The flavors were then tied together by the finesse buttermilk dressing that came with the subtleties of lemon, basil, and garlic. Addictive and highly recommended.  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($10) came with charred Brussels sprouts sitting on top of creamy corn grits and a touch of truffle oil. The truffle oil was noticeable but not overpowering. The smooth corn grits came with outstanding texture, and so were the charred-flavored Brussels sprouts. The convergence of flavors had the Brussels sprouts front and center. I really enjoyed it.  The Pigstrami Sandwich ($12) came with cured and smoked pork butt, egg, Swiss cheese, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, Dijon, and rye bread. The diced pork butt was served savory, firm and nicely smoked. The Swiss was able to round out the pointed Dijon flavor. And again, the contrast of crisp and soft textures was a common theme across these dishes. It was outstanding.  The Chimichurri Chicken Breast ($14) came with buttermilk chicken, chili fingerling potato casserole, and egg. The chicken was tender and moist, but I wished the buttermilk flavor could be more noticeable in transit between the taste of the chili and egg yolk. The potatoes were firm and not over cooked. It was good, but not memorable.  The Berry French Toast ($10) came with fresh berries, berry compote, maple syrup, and vanilla whipped cream. The toast was easy to cut into, soft and crisp in all the right places. The toast itself carried enough flavor for me to keep the maple syrup to a minimum. The vanilla whipped cream made it addictive. It was enjoyable, but I wished they have a better selection of French Toast and other sweet options than this dish.  Service was very professional, attentive, friendly, and personable. There was an air of formality to add to the grand sophistication that ranged from the decor to each dishes. Both food and service were very consistent, nicely orchestrated; and they were very easy to work with when I talked about my dietary preferences and restrictions. Overall, the originality of their dishes and impeccable service made The Gladly a great place for bringing guests and visitors. I would love to return to try their dinner menu and Sunday brunch.",

Highly recommend the ice ball if you go-- lasts for several drinks and keeps your drink perfectly cold.  Made right in front of you at your table which is a very entertaining experience.  Great patio, accessible parking.  Tim is our favorite server-- and he always take good care of us.  Ask for him if you go!",

We were looking for a place to go after taking our German Shepherd puppy and 10-month-old child for a hike, for some drinks and maybe some apps. We enjoyed it so much we stayed for dinner!  This upscale, but not pretentious restaurant offers a great selection of appetizers and entrees and a very aggressively-priced happy hour menu (bottles of wine for $20!). The drinks list had a lot of unique cocktails, more whiskies than I've seen anywhere in a long time and a decent wine and beer selection.  Kat was our server and she was fantastic! She was engaging and friendly. She was a wealth of knowledge with the menu and we ordered based on her recommendations. Even if the food sucked (which it didn't!) I would go back for Kat's service! She even brought over a bowl of water for the dog.  We ordered the Brussels Sprouts with grits, the cheese and sausage pretzel and the mozzarella fondue. Everything was delicious! For entrees we had the scallops and the famous chopped salad with salmon. The scallops were delicious! So tender and sweet. I would go so far as to say that the cola gastrique was probably unnecessary as the combination of scallops, belly bacon and sweet pea tendrils was a perfect on their own. The salad has its own Facebook page for a reason!  10/10",

Tonight was my first time at this establishment but it will by no means be my last! I wish yelp had a 5+ star option.   My friend and I chose to go here based off rave reviews right here on Yelp! We were a little hesitant at first because we had just come from the gym and were dressed more appropriately for, well... The gym! THANK GOD we didn't decide to go elsewhere! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a genuinely friendly (hard to find!) hostess as well as Robin (sp?), who I am assuming is the manager.   From the minute we were greeted to the moment we left- nothing but AMAZING and friendly service! I ordered the Seared Scallops on a bed of sweet corn grits (FANTASTICAL!!!!) and my friend ended up ordering the Chicken breast on a layering of fingerling potatoes (BOMB!). We had both oohed and awwed over the chopped salad though (which, btw, has it's own FB page! LOL).   Robin and our waiter, in listening to our commentary as we looked over the menu, brought out the chopped salad as our appetizer and said it was compliments of the house and that we both just had to try it! Robin was sweet enough to add in there that it'd help hold us over from our gym session till our entrees arrived. (Which it absolutely did!)  Ok- not exaggerating by any means here; some of the best tasting, outstanding quality  of food I've had while dining out in A LONG TIME! Plus to top it all off, the service was just as superb as our meals (AND that salad) were!   My friend and I sat and caught up with one another for about 2 hours and never once did we feel rushed to hit the road. In fact, they were still so great about continually coming by to keep our waters full and to check on us.  Maybe even more so than the food, my dining experiences are determined by the service; at The Gladly, I was entirely impressed with everything! Food, service, decor, ambiance- it was all spectacular! Thank you to the awesome staff, to the chef and to Robin! We'll both be returning multiple times, joined by everyone we know! :) LOL  Please do yourselves a favor and add The Gladly to your \"Must Try\" lists!",

I like that the portion sizes aren't enormous so you can eat what's on your plate. The service is always fabulous. Definitely recommended.",

I called the Glady and was told by the hostess that \"we have a person who checks each order before it goes out, so it's impossible that we made a mistake, the Uber eats driver must have stolen it.\"   I explained to her I just spent $60 on food and I was on my way back to pick up the missing salad. Mistakes happen but I am confident the Uber Eats didn't get hungry on the route and steal one of our salads. They also refused to replace the hot appetizers that are now cold, due to having to drive back to Glady's for the missing salad.   The Glady should invest in some service recovery training for their staff. This staff member was more focused on being right, than doing the right thing.",

    "text": "Lovely, inviting, and scrumptious!   I received a coupon for a free chopped salad with a purchase of an entree...yay! I have heard wonderful things about the Gladly and their chopped salad, so I just had to try it. I could only get food to go, and wasn't even sure if I could use the coupon on pick up orders, so walked in around lunchtime and inquired with the hostess inside. She was very warm and friendly (despite my messy hair and casual workout clothing attire), and said I could absolutely use the coupon. She asked me what entree I would like to accompany the salad and I chose the chicken club sandwich with a side salad. The menu is simple, made up of quality food/ingredients, and everything on it looks enticing. Once I ordered she invited me to take a seat at the bar and asked if I'd like a drink or anything; I sat down and the attentive bartender immediately came over and asked me the same thing...excellent service. I didn't wait long and my order was brought out to me nicely packaged, hot, and ready to go.  When I finally got a chance to try this famous chopped salad it was easy to see what all the hype is about. The couscous, pumpkin seeds, corn, tomatoes, and other fresh ingredients mixed with their secret dressing is delightful. The flavors blend beautifully and every bite is perfection. I just wish there was more of it! The chicken sandwich was very good as well, and made with nicely grilled chicken that was full of flavor and some of the best thick cut bacon I have ever had. With these quality meats it did not even need sauce or mayo, it was all delicious.   My experience at the Gladly was wonderful from the time I entered the restaurant to the last bite of my food. Everything was scrumptious and staff were excellent. Though I got food to go, the ambience inside is lovely, and I'd be happy to dine in as well.   So I say, head to the Gladly for an enjoyable all around experience.",

    "text": "Bernie Kantak is certainly a man who has Yelp bragging rights.  His two valley restaurants (Citizen Public House and The Gladly) are both tremendously popular 4.5 star spots.  I've dined at Citizen Public House in Old Town Scottsdale in the past and I can certainly vouch for Citizen's great food and ambiance.  I can also vouch for it's often overcrowded feel and ear piercing acoustics, but nevertheless its a place I'd certainly recommend for the culinary fare alone.  In The Gladly, I fully expected the menu and the restaurant feel itself to resemble much of what I experienced at Citizen.  And while I did experience some similarities The Gladly had a few more downsides than upsides versus Citizen in my book.  The Restaurant Week promotion got me in the door this time, so let's recap.  Located on the bottom floor of an office building on the southeast corner of 22nd Street & Camelback, The Gladly occupies what used to be a long time Ruth's Chris Steakhouse location.  The Gladly's simple but elegant decor is not too dissimilar from my experience at Citizen, but thankfully the acoustics here are a lot better than Citizen as I never had to yell at the person next to me to have a conversation.  And it's a good thing, because The Gladly can probably seat upwards of 150 patrons at full capacity.  Also a good thing because Diana Brandt (whom you may know as the woman behind the Arizona Foodie Blog) just happened to sit right next to me at the bar as I was enjoying my meal.  If you're a foodie and don't follow her Arizona Foodie Blog on social media, you really should fix that.  Back to the meal.  The Gladly's AZ Restaurant Week menu offered a pretty decent selection of items for each course (4 app choices, 4 entree options, and 2 dessert decisions).  For my first course I stuck with a familiar old friend.  The OMFG Salad may be a pretty common dish in the valley, but both Citizen and The Gladly do it superbly.  Salmon, couscous, pepitas, arugula, sweet corn, tomatoes, Asiago cheese, and raisins drenched in a buttermilk dressing.  There's a good reason this dish is so iconic in the valley.  Quite simply, its perfect.  For my entree, I'd had their pan seared scallops at Citizen before (excellent dish by the way) so I decided to go a little outside the box and go with the Duck Meatloaf.  This version includes fois gras and a cherry demi-glace atop a bed of grilled asparagus.  I was really excited about this dish, but I have to admit I was disappointed.  The meat was plenty tender but the flavors were completely flat to me.  I didn't pick up hardly any sweetness or acidity from the demi-glace and the millet mash on the bottom was also devoid of any discernible flavoring.  The meat itself was okay, but considering this dish is normally $30 (thankfully discounted for Restaurant Week) I would've expected more.  For dessert, I went with their Banana Pudding Jar.  Banana pudding, ground hazelnuts, nutella whipped cream, caramel, and a small sugar cookie on top.  I was fairly pleased with this dish except for the portion size.  It was incredibly tiny.  The container it was served in was more of a shot glass than a jar.  One area that The Gladly excels in that absolutely needs to be lauded is their bar.  Not only were the bartenders at The Gladly super cool, but their drink selection is almost ludicrous.  Worthy of particular praise is their Whiskey list.  It is byfar the most comprehensive whiskey selection I've ever seen at any business in Arizona.  American whiskeys, Canadian whiskeys, Irish whiskeys, Scotch whiskeys, you get the picture.  Altogether I'm guessing they've got no less than 300 different unique whiskey choices available on premises.  For my drink I went with one of their whiskey cocktails, Today's Tom Sawyer.  Canadian whiskey, spiced tea, egg white, lemon, and Drambuie Liqueur.  Solid beverage and the prep work was a fun show to watch.  Total price for my Restaurant Week experience including the food, cocktail, tax and tip came to about $60.  It needs to be said that the main courses here average about $30 when its not Restaurant Week so this more of a $$$ than a $$ spot.  The bar area is a fantastic spot to enjoy a wide kaleidoscope of whiskeys and other drinks and mingle with the bar staff.  The food (at least based on my experience here) was good in spots, subpar in others.  Which is why 3 stars is as high as I can go at this time.  I'd certainly come back during happy hour, but perhaps only for dinner by invitation.  But hey, if its good enough for the Arizona Foodie Blog, maybe its worth another try sooner rather than later.",

We ate the duck meatloaf, the Brussels sprouts and the short ribs. Everything was fine. It was solid but not awesome. The short ribs were not tender enough, the duck was a bit dry.   The biggest thing was the simple syrup that the bartender had made that night was overly sweet which the waiter came over an apologized for after because I complained the drink was entirely too sweet.

Honestly, one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time.  They also have an extensive whiskey list and you can add the coolest ice ball experience for $3 (part of that purchase goes to charity).  The food is also delicious. We went to the Gladly for a birthday party, so everyone pretty much tried something different. I had the Buttermooink Burger, which was Wagyu beef and a delicious bacon sauce on a buttermilk bun. The original chopped salad is also a hit.  GLAD we found this gem in the Biltmore area!",

    "text": "\"Ughh, I hate tomato\" I thought to myself as he walked away. \"I can't believe I let him convince me to order my salad with tomatoes,\" the under the breath comment was made. With the bartenders knowing what they're doing here, at least I knew I would be served a decent beverage.  This is one of my top choices for Happy Hour in Central Phoenix, the food selections are nice and the prices are reasonable. There is always a rotating drink special, and they offer the normal $1 or 2 off of drafts, wines, and wells that you'll find generally anywhere.   If you've not been to Citizens, R&R, Cowboy Ciao, or the Gladly for their Arizona Chopped Salad, you certainly need to come here for one, it's $8 at HH, and has it's own Facebook page and fan following, that salad is kind of a big deal. I'm never a 'fan' of tomatoes, but the first time I tried to order the az chopped without them, the waiter convinced me to leave them on, being marinated in a vinegarette of sorts for a number of hours, they almost don't even taste like tomato any longer. He assured me if I didn't like them, he would return the salad and get me a new one, sans tomato. Begrudgingly, I gave in, how can you argue with that sort of guarantee?  ... \"Ughh, I hate tomato.\" The moment was upon us, the salad arrived. Just like in all the pictures, it looked delish. He tossed the salad table side, and away he went. I can honestly say, this was perhaps the first, maybe the second experience in my life which I can ever recall enjoying a tomato. Happy that I let him convince me not to change it up, I loved every last bite. :-)  In a close second to their az chop, I do so love their brussel sprouts over corn grits, it's so good!! The wings are notable, but I wouldn't go out of my way for them, and they've got a sausage and cheese board that is also an excellent option from their HH menu.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, if you're not a fan of tomato either, let the Arizona Chopped Salad convince you otherwise.",

Despite just having opened the doors, everyone who was working here was so friendly and the food was fantastic. Thank you to everyone from the self-proclaimed \"lowly bartender\" who was the first to greet us to our server, Monica, who was attentive. We were the only people there for a long time, so it was pretty quiet. It seems like there would be a good bit of noise if the place were filled up, but we didn't have to worry about that.  My coffee was hot, fresh and strong and my grits were amazing. The combination with two eggs and slices of ham with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese was exactly what I wanted. The portion may not have looked like a huge amount, but I left feeling just the right amount of satisfied.  The whiskey list is impressive and the prices seemed in line with the norm. I'll have to find sometime to return when it isn't breakfast!  Everything was perfect. And the whiskey list is impressive... I'll have to come back when it isn't breakfast time.",

Our server on both occasions was Tim, and he was exceptional. Every person at our 10 top was in the industry, and we all agreed that Tim was knowledgeable and extremely personable.   Food highlights: brown butter tuna, fondue, crab cakes, duck meatloaf, and obviously the chopped salad. I could honestly eat that salad every day.... it's famous for a reason. Their cocktails here are wonderful as well. Their mezcal drink is phenomenal, and their buttered rum punch is so unique.   Wonderful food, exceptional service, amazing ambience.",

Once you enter through a narrow unassuming speakeasy type entrance, you enter into the main room. It's decorated in a hip and mid way.  We sat at the bar and met Mike. The friendliest bartender I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He walked through the rather large cocktail menu loaded with great selection of scotch, bourbons and other fine spirits.  Since we had just come from dinner at another restaurant, we only got a drink but made a plan to come back.",

I couldn't be happier that we did! From the start they impressed me with the nice touch of a Happy 30th sign on our table. We had a great server who gave us the perfect recommendations on drink selection and was very attentive to us. My husband ordered the Grilled Filet Mignon and I had the fish tacos. Both meals were delicious and the Filet was definitely worth the price! We finished off with a delicious hazelnut chocolate cake that was to die for!

We were greeted by at least four smiling, happy employees.   The service was excellent. I was a little disappointed by my Eggs Bernie Dict though. While the eggs, sausage and pretzel roll were good, the fondue sauce was not. It didn't taste like cheese to me- it seemed like more of an unfinished roux. If the sauce had been better, I would have enjoyed my meal. My husband ordered the grits and LOVED them. He's also a big whisky aficionado and wants to come back to try some of the Gladly's offerings.  Since there were so many positives here, I wanted to rate it five stars, and come back to try another entree.",

Whether you're in the mood for a great Happy Hour or a fancy dinner celebration - this place NEVER disappoints!   Some of my favorites:  Super Yummy Nuts - Great to munch on while enjoying a cocktail!  Roasted Brussels Sprouts over sweet corn grits with truffle oil - TO DIE FOR The Original Chopped Salad-  {famous!} and a must get!  Pan Seared Scallops- Always so tender and fresh - again, over the amazing grits.  Chimichurri Chicken - I don't even have words to describe the flavors in this dish! It is also HUGE so I always have leftovers! The potato casserole is incredible. Banana Cream Pie Jar - Heavenly if you love Bananas!   If you're a Bourbon drinker, this is also your spot. They have an incredible list and make the most amazing sushi grade ice balls to go with it {Extra charge but they also donate to prostate cancer!}.   Whew, that was a lot but I just can't say enough good things about this place. I know that we'll be back soon! If you're looking to impress a business client - TAKE THEM HERE.",

If you are not from area parking could be difficult, but park behind building and enter through main building on west side of building - small entrance just to the left once coming in.  Super cute trendy restaurant.  Came in for Happy Hour right before a show not too far away, at 5pm Happy Hour in the bar is already busy so get there early.  Food;  The Original Chopped salad is to die for, and a must try. Highly recommend, plus perfect for sharing. My all time favorite was the roasted brussel sprouts, I honestly could have sat and ate them all night. Also, tried to drink special of the day, which I couldn't tell you what was in it, it was a bit tart but refreshing.   Service;  While Cortney was main server, the support service staff was super attentive and very friendly.",

Unfortunately, I don't agree at all. The DEHYDRATED corn really ruined it for me. I'm not exactly sure why one would take a delicious, juicy vegetable like corn and then remove its juiciness to achieve a bland, CHEWY and dry kernel. The lack of flavor and poor texture made this salad completely unappetizing.   If that's not convincing enough, the price point is pretty high for a salad with less than a handful of each of its ingredients.   As a side note, the dressing is delicious!",

Then when she brought my check, she told me the crab cakes were on them and they didn't charge me for them. I thought that was really nice since they still tasted great. Oh, and considering that the mac and cheese was a \"side\" and only $6, it was a pretty big bowl. I was completely full from that and the two crab cakes.  I've been really impressed with the food in Phoenix in general and am planning another trip just to eat at some of these places again, especially The Gladly.",

Neat rows of fresh, perfect vegetables and finely diced smoked salmon which the waiter tosses at your table. Beautiful to look at, and just as tasty to eat.  One of my friends ordered the duck meatloaf which was so moist and flavorful, and the other got the ribs which was also perfect. I know I'm sounding repetitive but it really was all perfect.

At Gladly, the essences of whiskey and tobacco are beautifully merged in their cocktail called \"Conflagration Nation\".  First, the bartender lights-up a pinch of tobacco on a iron skillet.  Then, the smoke is captured in an upside down tumbler. Finally, that glass is quickly filled with a concoction of rye, bourbon. port wine, amaro, and mint syrup.  Smoke infusion, unlike that flaming cocktails shit, is no gimmick.  The sweet aroma of tobacco in that drink is REAL and thoroughly enjoyable.    No, I'm not a smoker, but I do love the smell of tobacco leaves.  So much that I see this trend of tobacco infusion as the greatest thing to have happened to cocktails since the olive.  With Conflagration Nation, mixologists Brandon Casey and his team of bartenders have nailed it straight and flush with one powerful blow.  This drink released the echoes of my talk with my dad, who, by the way, had never found it necessary to try a flaming cocktail.",

In this case it stands True.  My lady and I had visited this location for brunch on a Sunday where Veuve Cliquot had an event here, thus making our choice to frequent the establishment.   I perused the reviews here on Yelp! and was glad to discover that there were very good reviews for the location. I am very pleased to say that everything lived up to the high rating.  We enjoyed the Veuve champagne, but also had a glad of Crown Royal XO.   The service was fantastic. Our server John was absolute top quality, he was attentive without being intrusive, and his suggestions were on point.   We enjoyed the chopped salad (suggested by John) and found it to be an absolute delight of flavors. One of the best salads I have ever had. We also had the pan seared scallops and the BBQ brisket egg burrito. The scallops melted in your mouth. The flavor of the accompanying sauce was rich, amd the greens complimented it well with a bit of a higher taste. Simply awesome. The burrito featured brisket from Little Miss BBQ, one of the most renowned BBQ places, and it is located here in Phoenix. The owner of the  Gladly was a college roommate with the owner of Little Miss BBQ, so on occasion they collaborate. The burrito was fantastic. The pork was absolutely tender, seasoned with a bit of a kick, and complemented very well with the baser taste of egg.  This is an establishment I absolutely plan on frequenting further. It was an absolute delight.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner with some friends who were in town and had a pretty dismal experience considering all the positive reviews. While the food was fair... There was nothing worth going back for.   Our table appetizers where the charcuterie board (disappointing), the pretzel with sausage and cheese (very good), and the fondue (fair). My fiancee and I split the wedge salad (disappointing), and the group ordered the filet *2 (fair, although cold... The asparagus was old and dry but mashed potatoes were great), the chicken*2 (very lemony), the fish tacos (disappointing, lacked flavor), and the Mac & cheese *3 (great flavor but seemed like they didn't cook the roux long enough since it was still grainy). Pretty much everyone agreed the mashed potatoes that came with the filet was the best thing we ate, which is sad.   On the service side, the waiter didn't even bother coming by to take our food order until I stopped him AFTER our appetizers had already come out and where mostly gone. When our food did come out, 2 of our parties food was forgotten - which we didn't find out until everyone's food was already cold (because our waiter wasn't there to check on us when the food got there)... So to be fair to the food, it might have been better if it was hot when we ate it. Instead we sat around looking at it and waiting for the 2 missing plates to come out.  Our waiter happened by after at least 5-10 minutes, and when we *stopped* him, he said we just needed to wait because there probably weren't enough hands to carry everything... and then continued on his way. Another 5+ minutes passed before he came by and told us that he found out he had actually forgotten to put the orders in... But they were on there way now... so we waited another 15+ before our friend and her daughter finally got her food.   When the check came due we were going to split into 3... With the 2 people who's food was forgotten on one tab (the least expensive as one of them was a child and had only gotten the side of Mac and cheese and the other had the chicken, no appetizer and no drinks). Instead of offering to comp their food as you would expect, the waiter offered to comp an appetizer... Which was on my tab. It was totally ridiculous. I'm not the one that had to sit with my 6 year old with no food. I felt so bad for recommending the place based on the reviews that I just paid for everyone. Next time I'll stick with places I know are great... There are a million good places to eat in Phoenix with phenomenal food for foodies. There is no reason to settle for just *meh food... Especially with that kind of service.",

(I am not a smoker, but enjoy the smell of a great cigar) You must scroll down and find the review that I'm referring to.  My husband suggested on a whim to go try it.  We were in shorts and ultra casual.  I thought for sure I'd feel out of place.  Well I couldn't have been more off.

I got maybe 4-5 steak pieces (which was a decent amount per the size of the plate) and when I proceeded to cut the steak it was rare as hell.  Now I know some people enjoy this, I'm just not one.  The steak must have simply been seared on all sides then thrown on the plate.  By this time I was starving and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning my food and waiting.  I buckled down and ate the entire dish, and was still hungry afterwards.  Their old fashions get a 7/10 from me.  I forget the type of bourbon they used on the first one but it was mediocre.  The second one I ordered with bullet rye and it was on point!  Definitely come here in groups or for a business gathering.  It has a very sleek, casual, upscale feel in the heart of the Biltmore.",

    "text": "I'm having lunch here for the 1st time and this place is a hidden treasure.  Must visit.  It has a cute patio with about 8-9 tables and umbrellas, and a posh indoor dining area with a full bar.  I've always seen pictures of the \"Original Chopped Salad\" on Facebook and have been wanting to try it.  The pictures look great but they don't do it justice; I'll come back just for the salad itself.  My server Kailyn (spelling?) was exceptional, knew the menu items in detail, was very accommodating, and said everything with a genuine smile.  She told me about how the bloody marys here are uniquely garnished, are her favorite, and now I can't wait to try them (on a weekend).  I'd come back just for the great service and atmosphere alone. Let's talk about the menu in two words: phenomenal and creative. A specific example is the fish tacos with avocado butter, chimichurri (which adds a fantastic flavor you won't get anywhere else), and pickled red onion.  There are a variety of familiar items on the menu, but all has a unique spin of flavor and texture combinations that makes me want to try everything. I'll be back with some friends for sure.",

We absolutely loved every bite of our meal.  Great beer/drink selection too.  Kat was very knowledgeable about each menu item and we also loved that she knew a lot about beer!!  She was very personable, funny, and attentive.  We can't wait to return!!!",

Sunday is all day happy hour so we tried the Brussels sprouts and chicken liver pate. The sprouts were outstanding and the pate was good but the Brussels were really a stand out. I had the waffles and my husband had the steak and eggs special, which was melt in your mouth fantastic! The waffles were crispy, fluffy and had a salty sweet thing going on. Hands down best brunch in phoenix so far.",

    "text": "My husband and I were part of a group of about 12 in the upstairs room with a 7:15 dinner reservation, and the restaurant did not seem too busy on this midweek evening.  We nevertheless sat for quite a while before our server came around to even take drink orders.  So that was my first negative impression.  Then, apparently because several member of the group ordered drinks, our server seemed to think she did not need to come and talk about the menu, answer questions or take our orders until we had been there 30 minutes.  When she did finally reappear to take orders, she had a condescending attitude when asked questions about the descriptions on the menu and when we ordered.  When one of our party asked if any bread was included, he was informed he could buy bread for $7.  My husband and I ordered from the \"small plates\" section of the menu, and this was met with a slightly disdainful \"for your entree?\" comment from our server.            Fast forward another 45 minutes.  No bread/olive oil etc while waiting.  Increasingly loud ambiance from the bar area.  When our food finally arrived it was very disappointing:  a burger got passing marks, but my  Brussels Sprouts with Corn Grits (small plate $11) was practically inedible, being both undercooked and hard to chew, and burned at the same time.  The Pork Belly (three tiny portions for $13) was improperly prepared - intensely fatty and dripping with grease .  And our friend's Duck Meatloaf was dense and fatty.  And all the while louder and louder ambiance due to an influx of people into the nearby bar area.           Cut to the sad conclusion of our dining experience.  At least 4 of our party did not feel well (gastrointestonally speaking) later in the evening and into the next morning, including my husband, who can eat anything and never so much as burps.    When I read the Yelp reviews after I went back to my hotel, I could not believe I ate at the same restaurant.  Either things have really changed in the kitchen, or this is a classic case of Emperor's New Clothes. I am strongly leaning towards the latter.  Give this place a big pass.",

I also liked that it seemed like they were using \"local\" ingredients in addition to foods more \"native\" to the area (this special native American-type bread instead of English muffins in the eggs benny and also instead of pita bread with the burrata).",

I couldn't have had a worse assumption.  During the course of our meal they presented three different entree options for my son.  It was apparent that they wanted to make sure that his food was as pleasing as the adults.  The cocktail list was top-notch and all of the entrees were impeccably prepared.

Neither of us had been here before but she had heard good things about this place which I learned used to be a Ruth Chris steakhouse.  The interior was hip and modern. My niece ordered their version of the Chopped salad in which the ingredients are mixed tableside which was a nice touch. I had the pre-fixe $30 - 3 course meal opting for a Caesar Salad, Duck Meatloaf with foie gras mousseline, smoked cherry demi-glace, rosemary millet and topped with grilled asparagus spears and the choice of one of two desserts. The apps that we shared were the grilled brussel sprouts over corn grits and the pistachio chicken liver pate which were both great choices. I would have give this place the additional star if they had better dessert choices as part of the pre-fix restaurant week menu but overall The Gladly was a \"Winner\" in my book.",

Would recommend it.  We loved the dehydrated corn and pumpkin seeds in it - added some awesome crunch to the salad.  The only thing the salad was missing  was a kick of spice.  But that's a personal opinion.  My husband ordered the sea bass and said it was 9.5/10.  The cocktails we ordered we intriguing.  I would order the Thai margarita again.  The disappointment was the lack of a vegetarian entree listed on the menu.  I ended up ordering the roasted veggie small plate.  It was pretty meh.  For such a well respected restaurant I was expecting more.  I think I might have ordered the wrong thing but it didn't have enough flavor.  The service/staff was really nice!  Lastly, the gladly is a bit pricy.  I think that's why I was a little disappointed overall because I felt like I paid so much for the meal without going home raving.  I'm also not sure I'd come back.  Overall, I wanted to love it but as a vegetarian I wasn't impressed.",

The burger was incredible, if you've never had waygu you need to order this immediately, it literally melts in your mouth. I also added bacon too it which is a must, it paired amazingly with the chorizo grilled onions. The fingerling potatoes are also a must for a side. My boyfriend describes himself as a scallop connoisseur and orders scallops anywhere he knows they'll be good. He said these scallops are the best he has ever had. They paired perfectly with the grits and bacon. He said he could eat an entire bowl of just the grits and be happy. I wish we could have stayed for dessert since it all looked so amazing, but we were so stuffed from all the delicious food!",

    "text": "I would gladly come here (wink, wink, see what I did there?) anytime. It's so refreshing to have a restaurant in the Biltmore area that actually offers a late-night menu (11pm-1am). For a while, it seemed like all late-night restaurants were in downtown Scottsdale or downtown Phoenix. I didn't realize it was the culinary spawn of a former Cowboy Ciao chef until the menu showed a Facebook URL for the chopped salad. So happy I can get the chopped salad so close to home.   The first time I went here was with two girlfriends. We shared a brussel sprout appetizer which was very yummy. It comes on some very creamy grits, which became a favorite. They come with the scallops, an entree I would recommend. I had the duck ramen which is now been changed to a mussel ramen (duck too expensive?). That was fine but nothing really beats traditional ramen. So, in hindsight I would have tried something more American, which is why my last time eating at The Gladly, I had the duck meatloaf. There was enough for two meals! Loved the texture and you could taste the duck in every bite and it comes with a foie gras mousse and grilled asparagus. That time, my brother had the special rib-eye which was 18 oz (!). That turned out to be $48. So bear in mind, The Gladly is good for if you are OK to splurge.   As for dessert, I would recommend the blueberry bread pudding. It wasn't dense and it didn't left me overly stuffed like the entrees. I also had their chocolate creme dessert which is VERY decadent. Might be better to share that.   I also recommend hitting the late night menu, not just for the food but for the company. A lot of the patrons are people who work at nearby restaurants. So I found myself having great chats with a bartender at Capitol Grille and a manager at Christopher's Crush. You get an insider's look at the Valley restaurant scene and great options for food. My favorite was the crispy chicken skin banh mi. SOOOOOO Tasty! It literally was all chicken skin. Hoping they bring it back around for a turn!",

It's so fun and they managed to figure out how to put a bathroom IN the restaurant as opposed to when Ruths was there and you had to use the building's bathroom.   We shared the sausage, pretzel, and cheese appetizer. We shared the chopped salad, my husband had the mac and cheese and I had the chimichurri chicken. In a word...OMG. The chicken was perfectly done, juicy and flavorful. The chimichurri sauce was not overpowering and if you combined that with a forkful of mac and cheese--holy cow. The chopped salad, while you might think is a simple easy peasy dish was complex, flavorful and HUGE. I will definitely order that as my main next time we go. My husband and I could not believe how delicious this salad was. We were so full we didn't get dessert but next time...and there WILL be a next time.  Service was outstanding...friendly, polite, and very helpful to newcomers. The place was busy but there was no lapse in service at all. We were very impressed. Can't wait to go back with friends.",

The reason for  4 and not 5 stars is I have had a couple poor drink recommendations from staff for or a reccomendation on a drink that hadn't even tasted (special)    Love the food. The salad. The loli-pops. Etc. Dinner is right up to par with the apps.   I like the drinks too once I just trust my gut. The location is fun for people watching and great patio when it's warm out.",

We came in for restaurant week, fortunately I had made a reservation, so despite being totally full, our party of 6 was seated right away! Great service!   As for food, they have a few dish repeats from Citizen, but over all I think the menu was even more varied. I had the seared Tuna, which was delicious! I had ordered it rare, but it came out medium. No biggie, at least it wasn't over cooked, but that may have been the only fault of the night. The garbanzo cake the fish came with was incredible! So much flavor!!! With only a bit of spicy kick.   I'm really glad they have the famous chopped salad from Citizen, so of course that didn't fail to please! They were also very accommodating to my dairy allergy needs.   The actual restaurant is very hip, inside I actually felt like was transported to a chic restaurant in New York........ fabulous!!!! I can't wait for my next dinning experience at The Gladly.",

    "text": "I am gladly giving five stars for Chef Bernie Kantak's brand new restaurant located on the Camelback Corridor in the old Ruth's Chris location... I don't get out quite as often as I used to now that I have two little ones at home, so when I do get out, I like to try new places.  Such was the case this past Sunday when my mother-in-law offered to babysit so we could have a date night of sorts.  Jared and I ended up at The Gladly for a very memorable meal.  Since it was a spontaneous date, we arrived here without realizing that it was Arizona Restaurant Week, but that being said, we received even more bang for our buck!    We were super impressed with the remodel of the restaurant... it's got a great modern atmosphere with a fabulous looking bar, an elevated semi-private dining room and a more secluded banquet room in the works.  There will also be patio seating we were told.  Nathan was our server and he was friendly and attentive, as was the rest of the staff.  But the food was what really shined for us... Be forewarned, what comes next in this review is A WHOLE LOT of food.  We ate most of it too!    Chef Bernie told us that \"people go bananas for the pate,\" and he was right... we dug in so quickly when it arrived to our table, that I forgot to snap a picture, but the presentation was beautiful.  It's served with toast, pickled onions, mustard and capers and the pate itself is in a small mason jar.  Next up, we had an order of the lamb riblettes.  I think these were the highlight for me... seriously amazing.  I'm still thinking about them several days later!  For our salad course, Jared went with the famous \"Original Chopped Salad,\" and I decided to mix it up and try the Roasted Cauliflower Caesar.  I believe both were smaller portions for the restaurant week menu, but they were still plenty big for us and we were happy with our respective choices - both fresh and tasty.  By this point, I was pretty full, but I made room for the additional side we ordered of brussels sprouts and grits.  Mmmmm!  My entree was the only thing that wasn't amazing.  I had the yellowtail and it was overcooked.  I probably would have sent it back, but I was too stuffed by this point.  Jared had the scallop entree and cleaned his plate!  Dessert offerings on the restaurant week menu were peach cornmeal cobbler and buttermilk bread pudding.  We ordered one of each and ended on a sweet note.  Just like sister restaurant Citizen Public House, Chef Bernie partnered with Andrew and Richie on The Gladly, and it appears they've done it again... another fabulous restaurant has been added to the Valley dining scene.  We can't wait to return.  I suggest you go as well; you'll be GLAD you did!",

    "text": "I really liked this place.  My friend took me here when I was visiting.  I can say that it rivals and surpasses many of the best L.A. restaurants.  Not bad, Phoenix!  We arrived a bit early (I am not sure if they have valet parking but it's easy to park up the ramp or on the street.    Able to snag a bar seat we each had a cocktail.  I opted for the Thai Margarita: Patron silver tequila, galangal & kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, lime, rocks whilst my friend had a glass of white wine.  Service was pleasant and quick and the cocktail was absolutely delicious.  Shortly after closing out and taking our first sip we were seated at a table with one side a booth and the other a chair.  Aaron was our server, warm and welcoming asking if we had dined there before and explaining things and offering suggestions.  We had time so we started off with the appetizer feature which was mind blowing:  bread, house made pork rinds with a zesty sauce, and basically bacon fat butter in layman's terms.  It was smooth, spreadable, and I wanted more than the modest dollop on the far too large plate.  Next we tried the Duck Ramen.  The duck was cooked just right but to be honest I just don't think I am a Duck person.  I found it to be too thick and a bit fatty, spitting out part of it discreetly.  I loved the flavors in the soup though and the noodles were not overcooked at all.  The soup contains: five-spice duck ham, ramen noodles, pea greens, soy bean sprouts, spicy miso broth   For our mains we decided to split both the scallops (seared just right, flavored expertly, and over grits.  Amazing and fresh (they must fly in seafood daily)  We also split the Ribs feature, a special which was mind blowing and I forget all the ingredients but just know it was savory, with the meat soft on the inside with a crisp outer layer.    We got another round of cocktails including the \"Berried Alive\" which was very sweet and garnished with a stick of rock candy.    At times our cocktails were empty and some of the bus boys were eager to clear not yet finished plates  but our glasses were full and overall I was truly pleased with the pace of our dinner and I felt like the price was right for two people.  For all the food and the 2 rounds of drinks including tip it was $ 133.",

Service - 5 Star - and that's hard to earn from me Decor/Environment -3/4 Stars - It's okay, but felt a bit cheap to me compared to it's peers.   Food - 5 star - Everything I ate was good to excellent.  Delightful. Value - 4 star - It's not cheap, but most are reasonable, especially happy hour.  Came here for restaurant week.  Very surprised to love it as much as I did.    Tip:  Happy Hour is outstanding.  $2.50 beers, $5 cocktail of day, $5 wine.  4-5 apps, full size portions, are $5.  My wife ordered the Pate appetizer to start, and it was a generous sized portion of pate.  She loved it.  I ordered the brussel sprouts on grits.  I'm not a huge fan of either ingredient, but this was a knock your socks off good combination.  Very pleased.  We both ordered the chopped salad.  It was just as others describe, very good.  Don't expect a big salad.  I ordered the chicken chimchurri and it was a generous piece of chicken, delightful flavors, and a great spicy kick.  Not too spicy, but just right.  I never order chicken dishes in restaurants, but was glad i tried.  My wife ordered the duck meatloaf and shared with our son.  Both loved it.  Nice portion.  Great flavors especially the grain it was on top of.  I had the bread pudding dessert, and I love bread pudding, but this was the weak point of the entire meal.  Was much more like a thick pie, and while very edible, not great by any means.  My wife got the blonde dessert, and it was excellent.  Says it tasted like great fudge.  Anyway, even with happy hour and restaurant week pricing, it was $60/person with tip.  Lots of food, and very good quality.  Not cheap, but IMO worth it.  We will be back, and would put this on par with St. Francis down the street... both are truly outstanding examples of Phoenix restaurants.",

I ordered the filet and this is where the 3 stars come in.  For the price of the steak I would at least expect the meat to be prepared the way I wanted it.  I ordered medium and it was close to well done.  Now if this was the only issue then I could give a 4 star review however the steak itself did not taste well at all. This wasnt because of too much seasoning or lack of seasoning... I mean I have had steaks from Frys that taste better.    Step up your steak game and I will re-write my review...  I would probably wait for a while before I returned to give them a chance to redeem the 3 star review.",

Make sure to inquire about creative cocktails. The bartender can pretty much make exactly what you're in the mood for. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Holy moly would I GLADLY come back to the Gladly again!  The Hubs and I celebrated out anniversary this past weekend by having a fabulous meal at this fine establishment.  Everything, I mean EVERYTHING about our dining experience was amazing.  Between the awesome drinks, tasty food, restaurant ambiance and great service this place nailed it.  I really cannot remember the last time I had a meal that was just so perfect, hence the five star rating.  Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately seated (we had a reservation) and the hostess and the waiter even wished us a Happy Anniversary, which was a nice touch.  Tim, our waiter, was excellent... very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.  He guided us to the best drinks and food based on our preferences.  I had the berry cocktail and thought it was one of the best, if not the best drink I've had in a long time.  I can't remember the drink my Husband had, but he absolutely loved it.  For food, we shared the smoked cheese fondue, chopped salad, and coffee crusted short ribs.  Each course was great.  The salad, as you can see from all the reviews here on yelp is sooo... good.  The cheese fondue came with the perfect dippers... pork butt, crispy bread, and pears.  The short rib was cooked to perfection and accompanied by greens, this barley concoction that was creamy and delish, and a blueberry heaven sauce.  For dessert we shared the bread pudding and it was the perfect end to our wonderful meal.  Honestly, I cannot say enough about the Gladly.  Basically, I would GLADLY drop $100+ regularly for a meal this good.  Check out this gem, you certainly will be GLAD you did!",

Staff are great, loads of fun without being overbearing, great sense of humor, have never felt so welcome.  Ask for Tim -- he's awesome.",

The open glass look really makes the place so well lit during brunch and makes for a good seating experience. Since it was my first visit for brunch, I had their well known Chopped salad and its safe to see that on future visits, this will be a constant in my order. It comes in looking so pretty and all the different layers marked out and then its mixed up for you. It is literally an explosion of flavors in your month. I accompanied it with some delicious sorbet mimosa. The \"surprise and delight\" moment was when we got free dessert because service was a tad slow . It was some banana custard kind of thing with granola and some cookies on the side. Very delicious. I highly recommend paying a visit.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch with the husband last weekend after wanting to try this place since they opened. I have been to Citizen Public House several times and liked it very much. So why did it take me so long to get to the Gladly? Well...they have almost the same exact menu as CPH....not sure why....if you are going to have the same menu, why have a different name? Well, anyway, we got around to trying it last weekend at lunch time and it was sort of a let down. The place had a few people in it, but not many. I got the wagyu french onion burger and husband got the BLT no aioli. Well, we get our food and my burger is ok, but his BLT had aioli....the waitress hadn't written down the order, so that may have been the issue. We preceded to wait for like 6-7 min for her to come by so he could ask her to remake the sandwich (he's allergic to eggs, so wiping it off wouldn't really suffice). She took it back without issue, but in the meantime, we've been sitting 6-7 minutes with my food getting cold. Then it took another 10 to get the sandwich back, so by that time my food was soggy and kind of cold. Not sure what this restaurant was thinking since most people don't want to eat their meal while their dining companion watches and then sit and watch them eat later, but no comment was made by the waitress. The burger was nothing special, it tasted fine...it wasn't really french onion -y as it was supposed to have an onion sauce on it, but really just had plain onions on it. The salad it came with was tasty, it had figs, cheese,  and weird smokey almonds in it (which weren't awesome, but the rest was good). When the husband got his sandwich, he was kind of disappointed. The bacon was super thick cut...more like ham, so it was really flaccid and heavy....not really what you want when getting a BLT. Overall, the meal wasn't awesome, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel. I had seen that they had a special the night before for dessert (a banana chocolate pot of sorts), I asked if they had any left, and they did! Got one and it was delicious! I kind of loved it. Anyway, the dessert was the saving grace, but I don't think I would go back all that soon as I was pretty disappointed with the entrees and service.",

No cosmopolitans or rum and cokes here!!! Brandon is a master behind the bar. And the food is crazy good. From the Hillbilly egg roll to the Original Chopped Salad all is fantasic. The patio is an added bonus to those that want to enjoy the weather. A must visit.",

    "text": "i went here with a couple of girlfriends for a 'girls night' dinner. solid place for a date night dinner. the ambiance is loungy and relaxing, lowly lit, and comfy. it is also the kind of place that you take someone that you want to impress but not have to drop too much cash like you would at other \"new american\" restaurants in the area.   i liked the entree options (ribs, scallops, tuna, and quite a few pork dishes) and also was intrigued by the cocktail selection. looks like they have a lot of unique cocktails that would be great to try. i had the tuna and it was prepared perfectly medium rare. i loved the avocado tzatziki that came with it. it was light and airy but had a lot of flavor. i only wish there was more of it on the plate.  i think the service was the only less than stellar thing at this place. while our waiter was nice, he wasn't really all that attentive and only came back once to refill drinks/take drink orders. we also wanted to check out dessert but unfortunately he forgot to bring the dessert menu and just brought us our check.  it was busy even on a Monday so i would definitely get reservations if you'd like to check this place out. i may be back for a little happy hour cocktail exploration but not too sure about a full dining experience again.",

    "text": "My sister and I ate dinner here for the first time last night and were completely impressed in every aspect! We were immediately greeted by cordial staff and didn't have to wait very long to be seated (although we did have a reservation). Our server was Shane, a guy who is clearly a baller. He was sweet, funny and answered all of my asinine questions about the myriad of items I didn't recognize on the menu. He happily recommended we get this cray cray drink that had ROCK CANDY in it. Like a stick of rock candy. It was fucking adorable! Naturally I took several pictures of this drink like a badass nerd. I would post it on here, but I am super lazy. Anyway, we ended up ordering the duck ramen soup and the blue cheese steak salad with a side of fries for our meals. It all came out pretty quickly, which was good, because those rock candy dranks were quite strong and I needed food in my belly. The duck ramen soup was amazing! It was spicy, flavorful, and made me feel like a warm toasty marshmallow. I loved it. My sister's salad was also really bomb. Hey, did you know they make their own ketchup? Well now you do. You can tell too, it tastes amazing! We finished off our meals with the ice cream cones. You get 2 little ones that are perfect for sharing. We got the bourbon cherry ice cream with dried cherries on the side. Not surprisingly, it too tasted great. Everything was moderately priced and I felt the portion sizes were proportionate to the cost. Overall, it was a really great evening. Everyone was super upbeat and friendly and the vibe of the place is very chill. Not too staunch, not too laid back, just right. Well done, friends.  Oh and the music? Whoever is selecting that, I love you. Is that awkward? Please play more Wagon Christ. :) It makes me click my heels together in mid-air.",

Out of their extensive whiskey list (which is borderline excessive), the Beginner's L is the #1 all time. Their chopped salad is the best in the valley.

The Brussels Sprouts are so, so delicious.  The grits they come with is creamy and rich.  The Original Chopped Salad is a MUST.  I was hesitant of the ingredients, but loved it!  I think my words were \"I'm in heaven\" as I ate.  The drinks are creative and well executed.  The Banana Creme Jar has just the right amount of banana.  The caramel on the bottom is super yummy.  The service is excellent and the ambiance is  swanky but not snooty.  Great for a romantic date night or a fun night out with friends.  Can't wait to come in for brunch!  Highly recommend.",
