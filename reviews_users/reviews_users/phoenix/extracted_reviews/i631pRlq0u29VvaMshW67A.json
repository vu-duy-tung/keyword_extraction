We played around with their camera option on the bowling monitors. Laser tag was fun, but they didn't give out official start times so I felt as though the game wasn't fair or didn't have official \"sides\". (Hey laser tag is competitive). Ropes was fun too  We only ordered the thai wings & parmesean garlic fries. Those were so good!!!   If I were to complain about anything, it would be the price of their drinks, but then again I'm from Michigan so I don't know how things price out here in Arizona.",

We went in and walked around to get familiar with the place.  There is a fair sized arcade, bowling, laser tag, pool, etc.  We did not go bowling or do laser tag but we did go to the bar for a beer.  Eventually, we decided to play some pool for a while and after that, we tried out the shuffleboard (I hadn't played shuffleboard in years).  They could use more sand to sprinkle on the board but we were able to make do.  Overall, it was a fun evening.  We were able to relax and have time to ourselves.  I would have no problem coming back and checking out the bowling down the road.",

We did the gravity ropes, laser tag, bowling and arcade games. Then we also had an hour to eat and I want to recognize Hector for his amazing service! I've never been so pleased with our server as much as I was with him. He took care of our entire group and made sure we all left happy. This has been the best birthday I've had by far and I know my entire group loved being there as well. We will all be recommending this place to our friends for the near future. Thank you also to Spencer for taking care of any needs/questions we had once we were there! Over such a great experience and I can't wait to come back for another event. Thank you so much hector for making this night memorable, fun, and easy going for all of us!",

Went bowling with some friends; again great equipment, but no lane servicing at all. We had to leave the lane for a good 15 minutes to go to the bar and get drinks. This was at around 5 pm on a wednesday, with no crowd and no waiting. You'd think at $29 per hour +$5 for shoes you're at least be paying for some kind of lane service. At the end of your hour, even if you are on your last frame and you don't finish they dont do a courtesy time frame to let you finish your round like they do at top golf(2 min). Wouldn't recommend going here unless you're okay with mediocre service.",

To just the bartender being extremely rude and by passing you when there is no other ppl at the bar to order. Then when you finally get the chance to order they are rushing you when you ask them about their special drinks. They need to hire personable ppl. That's why it's called customer service",

Some of the arcade games are a little expensive to play and you can blow through $40 in a matter of a few minutes.   The laser tag was tons of fun even though I got hurt playing it. Hey, at least I won the round. Haha.   There are lots of things to do here including karaoke, eating, arcade games, laser tag, and suspension lines. It's a lot of fun and great for small-large groups, birthday parties, etc.",

Party of 4, went it, ate at the bar, food looked and tasted good, I had the hummus with fresh and crisp veggies (nothing that I hate more is good hummus and dry vegetables) pita was excellent, my friends had chicken and waffle, I tried it, it's legit and the mac & cheese was awesome too.   We played laser tag, 15 minutes $8 per person, it was really fun, nice set up and very clean. The coach that played with us though, she killed all of us like 10 times and was kinda cheating and was not fun having to wait for your shield to go back up once you get shot by her.  I would definitely recommend this for fun things to do with friends or family when in the Valley. Will be back soon for sure.",

We walked in and someone greeted us right away and directed us to the bowling shoe station.  The place was clean, and spread out, so not crowded.  The cashier informed us of a Spring Break special going on, which included the following from 1-5;  unlimited Laser Tag, Gravity (this tightrope walking maze they have), Pool and Bowling (separate charge of $3 for shoes).  So we bought that.    We also purchased a game card, which they offered a deal of $65 worth for $50.  Was cool to get that considering the games are sorta expensive ($1.50-$3 per game).  We had a technical difficulty upon retrieving the card after the purchase, but they got tech support on it right away. No prob.    Laser Tag was real fun, games were fun, but expensive.  Bowling was great!  Food and drinks were pretty good.  Staff and service was great.  Overall experience was good, especially seeing my son so happy there.  I'd go back again, but only during specials because they're kind of pricey.",

I had to make a couple changes to my initial reservation and each time I called, it was absolutely no problem at all.  Even though I was afraid my requests for change would be seen as a major hassle, I was never made to feel that way. Each of the sales staff I spoke with were very accomadating and courteous.   Any other kids party I've had, I've always been the planner, chef,  host, etc.... I think the best part of having it here was someone else took over all that and for the first time ever I was actually able to enjoy my child's birthday celebration instead of worrying about food, schedules, activities, refills, etc! I was an active participant in the fun instead of a frazzled parent!  Everybody I came in contact with from initial reservations to the very end were so friendly and helpful. Our 2 young party hosts were on the ball with bowling shoes, drinks and keeping all of us on schedule and busy.  Most importantly, my son and his friends who attended had a great time and that's all that matters to me! I would definitely go back again!",

Kids can get their energy out rather than passively sitting on a ride like at Amazing Jakes or Golfland. The place is also super clean and new looking.

Waiting to bowl, waiting for food & drinks.. that's understandable. However if I would've known the extent of the wait times I would've saved money and gone to a different bowling alley. I went to the bar and I ordered a plate of wings to share with my boyfriend. After about 45 minutes I see the plate come out and they set it behind the bar area and walked away. They gave the wings to someone else after a few minutes so I asked the bartender about my order. I told him I thought they gave it to the wrong person. He said he didn't know what happened with it so he would put the order in again and try to rush it out because at this point it was over an hour we waited. About 15 minutes later someone brings us a plate of the WRONG flavor of wings. I told the bartender this wasn't what I ordered. He offered to get the right order but by then I was so sick of sitting there that I just asked if we could take the wrong order for free. I didn't even have an appetite anymore so I gave all the wings to my boyfriend. Big mistake there because he got FOOD POISONING the next day. Was extremely sick to the point I thought I was going to have to take him to the hospital. I get that you have a lot of people to serve but that doesn't mean you send out undercooked food. I watched another table return the pizzas they ordered because the dough wasn't cooked. This place is just honestly a mess and not worth a dime I spent there. Take your money somewhere else.",

    "text": "Main Event, overall, was a blast for a party of 5! We took advantage of the summer pass deal, about $20 per person, to bowl, laser tag, high rope, and pool unlimited! You really can't beat that deal.   The staff were mostly friendly, they make everything simple to understand. However, the high ropes woman was a bit on edge, which I understood it was already around 11 pm, but she didn't make it the best experience.   Bowling was a lot of fun and the simplicity of choosing a bowling ball makes it easy for those who don't frequently bowl. All you have to do is choose a weight, then the size of your fingers. This helped to prevent discomfort for my fingers that I usually get while bowling.   Laser tag was loads of fun! It's cool that you don't know who's team you are on until entering the play area, which prevents any unfairness of teams. They give a lot of time to play, enough until we were all out of breath.   I had a great time here! Only fix would be to be a little more clear with high ropes, checking in, time allotted, etc.",

She smiles and was patient with the children. overall the party experience was excellent staff was helpful and friendly. The food is why it gets 3 stars the menu didn't even look desirable, to cluttered with stuff. the Pizza was burnt even the children didn't eat it. The family that ordered off the menu well the food presentation was not inviting at all. I'm all about a good time with good food and I was very disappointed. I was had to leave because I was hungry... Great for a party not so hot on the food !!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I may have walked into this place out of The Twilight Zone. It was QUITE strange.  It seems like a great place and idea. Games, bowling, laser tag, restaurant, etc.  However, without any customer service, it is only that.  We had a 13 person party and when we asked if there was any deal that we could have for a group, the manager was curt and said, \"only if you book 2 weeks in advance and our sales office is closed now, so no.\" We decided to go over to the bar and inform them that we had a 13 top in the dining area, which the bartender told us he would inform a server. After 30 minutes of waiting, we went back to the bar and the bartender told us, \"the kitchen is closed.\" At 10:30 pm, the kitchen closed. We had to track staff members down to get any services, then when we did, they were rude, short and upset with us.  They treated us like we were trespassing, when we really just wanted to eat and bowl. The bartender appeared to be high as he had glassy eyes, would start serving us then wander to another patron before going back and not returning. He poured us drinks and couldn't remember if he charged us (despite us being two of four people at the bar).  It is a great place to go if you do not want to be bothered and just want to relax with the other high schoolers drinking red bulls at the bar, before going to the party in the parking lot of underage youth who were recreating a scene from Fast and The Furious or play hide and seek with disgruntled staff members, but not if you wanted to bring a family here or have any sense of customer service.",

    "text": "Birthday Party Review.   We had my son's birthday party here today. All seemed fine and great when booking. We did the extreme package with bowling and laser tag for 10 kids. At 19.99 a kid I expected way more.   First, our host Dana had the worst communication skills and was very slow. Our party was supposed to start at 2 and we were to be there at 145. The kids don't get shoes until after 2, there was still a party on our lane. We don't start bowling until 220. We also paid for an extra lane for adults. Time is cut off exactly at 3, even though we didn't get a full hour! Nothing like paying an additional $36 for 40 minutes of bowling.   The pizza part went fine and was cleared away. Then our host disappeared and She finally shows up with the cake almost 5-10 minutes later! Leaving a group of 10 kids alone is like turning your back on the ocean! All craziness is let loose.   Now for laser tag... the kids are taken in and let loose for 10 minutes before the game even begins! No communication that game hasn't started, scores aren't counted.. zip, zero, nada.   Afterwards, the host gives the kids the game cards and sets them loose, even though I requested that I hand out the cards (a mom has rules to go over).   To put the cherry on top, I was not informed of the service charge and tipped on top of that! Way to go Main Event. You are a terrible business. I will not be back",

    "text": "Don't go to main event!!!!  So I recently went to main event in tempe on Saturday 3-3-18. It was my friends bday and we figured it was a fun place to go out with friends and have a good time..........nope I was wrong. To start the night off 2 of my friends arrived at 5pm reserved a lane but were told it would be a 2hr wait. Ok understandable since it was a saturday. So I arrived with the rest of my group at 645 pm to find out that the lane still wasn't going to be ready for an extra hour. So we then preceded to request a pool table and again were told it would be 2hrs for a table. So finally we go reserve a spot for laser tag which that was a shorter wait time since you only get 15mins a round. So by the time we were done our bowling lane still wasn't ready for another hour. At this point it was a waste of money. We each spent 30 plus dollars for \"unlimited\" play but only played a round of laser tag. Finally we get our lane and we finally get to bowl. We order some food and drinks. Well then we didn't even get to finish our game because you only get so much time on the lane and the game locked on us so then our friends began to leave then after 15 mins it came back up for us to finish. So in that time we realized that 2 of our friends never received their food and when the server came over to us she then began to say she did bring it over. Well we ordered the triple play and nacho plate. Our other friend ordered the spinach dip. Well spinach dip comes on the triple play so the server tried to say that it wasn't part of the triple play and then corrected herself and said that she did bring 2 out when she didn't even bring any of the food it was a different server. So after that I asked for a manager and told him about our long wait times and the food mess up and then he told me he would take care of the spinach dip order but yet no apologies for the wait. Regardless of what day it was they should be capable of handling the busy rush since it's a popular place. I'm truly grossed out with this place and will not be going back! They need a better system to organize the wait times and also account for how many parties they except since I also saw plenty of party groups there.  Also if I could give zero stars I would but sadly I have to give one. So don't waste your time or money here it's over priced and the food isn't worth the money.",

When we tracked down an employee and asked, they said to just sit at a table and a server will find you. We didn't get noticed as a new table until flagging down a server. All 4 orders came wrong the first time, and food service was very slow. Arcade is ok, but when trying to do gravity ropes, we stood in line to buy tickets assuming we can go and use them since there apparently wasn't a line. Turns out there is a 2 1/2 hour wait, and the ticket counter has no information on the wait times for any events except bowling.",

Laser tag is super fun-- must try! Gravity is for those brave souls who like to suspend themselves while walking across planks. Bowling has a nice twist as you get to take photos and cute little videos play as you get strikes, spares and gutter balls.   Good for a date or a big group because there's so much to do! They also have arcade games, a bar and pool tables. Lots of big screen TVs with sporting events playing.",

Laser tag and the arcade are worth it though. As far as the ropes course goes, it takes maybe 10 minutes to go through it but after 2 minutes they start yelling at you to come back and that your time is up. We barely had time to cross more than 2 bridges. The main problem with this place though is the staff. They clearly don't care about or enjoy their jobs. My 7 year old and his friend were both scared on the ropes course and the employee up there with them wouldn't help or do anything. He just stood there with a blank and bored expression and ignored them crying. They either need better management or better employees, not sure which the problem is. Also, my sister paid a lot for a birthday party and they did not give her the amount of arcade cards that she was promised. There was also very little organization. Overall, the kids had fun but it was more expensive and more stressful than it needed to be.",

I am still at the location and the district manager called me to apologize and the manager promptly came over with a $20 video game card for each of my kids.  The response from the district manager was understanding and swift and my kids are grateful for the extra video game time.  I updated my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars and we will likely be back in the future.  The winter funpass is a good deal for cabin feverish kids, however the staff and management are rude and inattentive. I brought my kids here to beat the winter blues and get some work done. I got the kids the winter funpass and sat at a table in their restaurant area.  The staff never came over, regardless of walking by several times.  On each table there was an ad for \"Buy a $25 gift card, get a $10 bonus card.\" When I asked about this, I was told the ad expired yesterday (there was no expiration on the ad) and that they would not honor it.  The manager stated that they were in the process of removing them, but had only gotten to the sign on the front of the building.  The ad was on every table with no expiration, however he was unwilling to honor.  I am not one to complain, but any other establishment would have honored their posted promotions. It will be awhile before I come back, if ever.  For the money, Dave and Busters or Ultrastar are much better options.",

It has a classy Lucky Strike kind of feel with a full menu and bar. The system allows you to take a selfie for your name and score and its very interactive giving interesting player stats throughout the game. Our server was incredibly nice and friendly, apparently she had been working a double shift, but she was so upbeat- you would never be able to tell. We ordered the chicken quesadilla, 2 orderes of garlic fries and onion rings. It was all yummy. The onion rings were more like onion straws - which I prefer and the fries had just the right amount of garlic. We each paid for the all you can play bowling, laser tag, climbing etc wristband which was around $17 and worth it. I was dying laughing from playing laser tag with my friends and a bunch of strangers. I found out later that all of my team was hiding out upstairs, which explains why I was getting crazy shot up by the other team downstairs. They have an interesting harness system that allows you to do tightrope walking and other crazy obstacles over the arcade. The arcade could definitely use more games and I didn;t get to play billiards but I will try next time! Overall, it was a fun night! I hope this place can compete with Dave and Buster's, I would say it's location is limiting since it randomly placed next to the IKEA deep in Tempe.",

    "text": "Today I took my family to Main Event in Tempe AZ for the first time. I have booked corporate events at this locaiton but have never attended an event before. We arrived and it looked like it was busy, but not horribly crowded. When we got to the cashier we asked to take advantage of the Funbination promotion - I asked how long of a wait it would be, the cashier said 20 minutes to bowl. At the time this didn't seem bad so we paid for two adults and two children plus shoes. We then bought $50 worth on a funcard and played some games while we were waiting.  Well, twenty turned into 45 and finally our buzzer went off, we snagged shoes and followed Victor to our lane. We began bowling and after what we thought was our first round, the waitress comes and brings us our ticket to cash out. At this time, I asked to leave it open as we were going to order more food - she then shares that we have to leave our lane and get put on a wait list to boaw again...WHAT???   My husband and i look at each other clearly confused - this is supposed to be unlimited. I question the waitress and she offers to let me speak with a supervisor as I shared that I was unhappy and wanted my money back as this wasn't wait I had paid for and no one shared this would be the process. I had a one year old with me and if we would have been aware that we would have to wait to bowl a second round then we wouldn't have stayed. - I wanted to be able to bowl consecutive games with my family - not wait around and relocate. This was the first we heard of this stipulation to the unlimited options and we were expecting a manger to be apologetic and caring...instead I got Jason - who was rude and unapologetic and who began telling me that all the employees share this informaiton and he \"knows we were told\". (pretty much accusing me of lying.)   At this point i am incredulous at his demeanor and how rude he was - (Consequently, I also responded in kind with very terse words and comments for Jason on his behavior - which he clearly did not want to own as he felt he didn't need any feedback. - trust me he does.)  He was so self-satisfied and smug with his certainty that he was right. He actually said he was, \"99.99% positive and it would be a miracle if we weren't told we wouldn't be able to play consecutive games\" he wouldn't even listen to my complaint of not being told - and my ask for my money back as I clearly did not get what I had paid for as this aspect of the day wasn't explained.  He was such a jerk about the entire thing I asked to speak with someone else and he said there was no one else in the building for me to speak with - I asked for his name and information and he gave me the information for his GM (who I am also emailing over this issue.)  All in, we spent over $150 at this establishment and sadly, I will never be back to this location and am writing about this experience so others know not to visit this store as clearly there is no care for the customer.   Reading the other reviews it appears that many feel the same way and it also looks like a few have encountered Jason, the uncaring manager and walked away feeling the same way as I. Ripped off and upset.",

We sat in a booth for at least 10 minutes before the waitress came to say \"I will be right with you\". Then another 10-15 minutes later, still no sign of the waitress or anyone to even take a drink order. Extremely frustrated, we went to talk to the manager to let her know what happened and that we didn't even want to wait any longer to eat and were leaving. All she said was \"okay I will check what happened\" and that was it. No apology, no offers to help make the experience better, nothing. I will not be going here again.",

The only downfall is the lines are fairly long for the laser tag and rope jungle gym and you need tickets to reserve a timing...it gets kind of annoying.

I think having to wait it just going to happen since there is only one of these locations in the metro area.  I live an hour away and would take my kids here over Dave and busters at least during the week.  They need to build one in the north Valley like happy Valley and I-17. It would do great considering all the family communities around it. The waiting is just going to happen based on the demand of a great facilities and service. Only way to fix it is build more.  I would even have my kids birthday parties here if they were closer.",

    "text": "Hosted my son's 8th birthday here. It was 16 children most on the spectrum, and one huge adventure. We started by arriving about 15m before the scheduled party, the host greeted us and took the cake and goodie bags to a staff manned area. We had to sit in the main hall way by the entrance until the start of our party which was a little odd, there ended up being 16 kids and sets of parents just sitting by the entrance... we then started the bowling game which it was not explained to me the kids would throw the ball once (ve twice) per turn and the confusion took away from the game, which was ultimately cut short. If you have a large number of kids please have multiple hosts and small activities for them to work on in between turns. The food that was served was hot dogs and chips(plus a drink) which wasnt bad for hot dogs. Only downside there wasnt a seating area for the parents, nor food available for the parents. There was a snack bar with food for purchase, but it was not brought to our attention until the tail end of the party. The game room but design id awesome, the prices per game not so much. They were given a 5.00 game card included with the party package  (one per kid) and 5.00 in this game room doesnt go very far. Most kids were out of money in roughly 10 minutes of playing. I know its not chuck e chesse where games are 1-2 tokins (.25-.50) but 1.25 for one play on a fame seems a bit much. Over all the kids had a blast and were sleep in the cars before we could leave the parking lot. I would return and it is a great place for kids on the spectrum to be able to frequent. The hosts were great (Levi was our main host) and tried to make everything perfect.",

    "text": "Wow. What an awesome place for kids and adults alike. This was our first time visiting. We used the summer fun pass special, what a great deal. When we arrived, we walked right up to the check in counter, the associate was very kind and explained everything to us, and made sure we had no questions. The manager Jim was standing there and offered to show us around. My boys wanted to play laser tag first, unfortunately there was a game going on so we had to wait about 10 minutes, while waiting, Jim showed us around the arcade, even set my boys up with 1 free game, trying to scare them. Lol.  Laser tag was a blast. We then went on the gravity ropes, now, I'm a big chicken, so it scared the hell Out of me, but it really was a lot of fun, coordination helps. Lol. After that if was off to play Billiards.  Then a little lunch, they have a very nice restaurant inside, average cost for restaurant food, and pretty decent too. Then we went bowling, they have the greatest bowling here. They have a bowling game called \"toons\" where it takes 3 different pictures of each player and then after each turn, it plays a little story with all players in different scenarios, riding a motorcycle, parachuting, dancing, etc.  Back to the gravity ropes we went. I didn't go this time, but both my boys did, wow, what an experience, there does not appear to be any sort of time limit that they can stay up there, but I guess that probably depends on how busy they are, my boys spent about 30 minutes up there going on all the different obstacles.  Forgot to mention, my boys are 10 years old, this place is awesome. Now, I do have to say, without the summer fun pass, this would have been way to expensive to bring my family, and we also went on a Monday, I don't really know how busy the weekends are. But I definitely say, try this place out before September 1,  2014 and take advantage of the summer fun pass.  The only thing that bummed me out about this location, is that there is no Mini Golf and No Rockwall. And the video games are really expensive and not included in the Fun Pass..... Extra Kudos to Manager Jim, he went above and beyond to make sure my boys had a good time, he was always available to answer a question or help out where need be. Another shout out to Drew at the restaurant, thanks for the great service.   I only rated 4 stars because I was bummed that there was no rock wall and no mini golf, also because of the cost of the video games. But over all experience was fantastic.....

The bowling alley is the highlight of this place. There are many lanes.  They have the newest arcade games on the market and they were pretty cool. The games were cool , but too damn expensive. It was about $1.25 on average for every game there which is pretty ridiculous. I can see paying that on the newer games, but even the timeless classics like basketball were that price.  The food is shit. A friend got the pizza and it was terrible.  Hamburgers were gross. I got a salad. Wait, actually I got dressing with a side of lettuce. Nasty. Everyone I was with tried something different and not one person liked anything they got practically. This place is a cool concept, but I wouldn't come back. Dave and Buster's is way better if I wanted to go to a place like this again.",

Our server Josh was really nice however, he changed the experience. He was really patient with us, but the bowling host didn't explain anything to us, just told us what the price was and sent us on our way and not to mention she wasn't too nice, same with the obstacle course and laser tag host.

It was $17.95 for all you can play bowling, laser tag, etc. what they don't tell you is that you will spend 2+ hours waiting to play any of the games. So in the end you spend the whole night there and only get to play 1 or 2 games of anything. Essentially it's a huge rip off. Might as well just go to a bowling alley or laser tag place. I won't be coming back for sure. Also the service here is atrocious. You will spend 15+ minutes at the bar just waiting to get a beer.",

Both times we entered the laser tag room, an employee YELLED at everyone to shut-up so he could talk and made all kinds of threats if we didn't listen to him. He was very disrespectful and far more immature than the few kids who were talking. This was quite unnecessary, he seemed to either be showing off for someone or floating on a power trip of some sort. In addition, the young man stationed at the front entrance was unable to answer the simple questions we had for him regarding the establishment. He either seemed mentally disabled or impaired. The concept is great, the place is great, but the employees definitely need customer service training.",

What am I supposed to be tipping for???....I'm buying tickets and arcade time. Just seemed greedy to me. Would have given 4 stars otherwise. And please by saying \"you don't have to tip\", it just makes it worse. Puts a customer on the spot to hand back a receipt to the cashier with a line drawn thru the tip part of receipt. I totally get tipping the server that came to our table tho, just not when buying an armband and/or arcade time.  If i ever come back i will bring cash to avoid the awkwardness. Will tell my friends the same thing. Please get rid of the tipping at the cashier box. It's tacky. We spent 250.00 that night, for arm bands, arcade time and food, and drinks.

Finally got a lane and then it wouldn't work after the kids entered their names and took their pics.  Called on the intercom and waited 15 minutes.  Called again and was told a tech was coming.  Had to wait another 5 minutes and told the waiter before it was fixed.   The whole time, there were other open lanes that we could have been moved to.   After bowling went to buy a soda and there was no line.  Cashier told me it would be a minute and then she took about five to fix the register receipt.  No apology or any other communication so I gave up on the soda. The bright side was the cashier who sold us our passes was friendly & helpful.  Experience this time was a bummer and we have had good times before.  We will be going to FlipSide or Fat Cats next time though after this poor customer service today.",

Old school games bring back childhood memories, and adult for that matter. - Laser Tag is a 2 at best. Give me something to REALLY do while I'm running around a dark room.

I'm only giving it a 2 due to my Stella Artois on tap! I just had the same rita made 3 times due to the sweet n sour, or lack there of. It's siphoned through the soda machine spray, so you KNOW what that means. Yes! It's watered down with that good ole Arizona non-filtered tap water! WTF?! First two were crystal clear, almost like water. I had to ask was there any Grand Marnier in the darn thing. It was watery, so she took it back. Next one was even worse. Third one, absolutely awful.

We were bowling and couldnt get a waitress over so we could order food and drinks.  Finally got our food but no sauce for our strips and no napkins.  Had to ask.  While we were bowling the bar came down on the pins and said our time was up. We hadn't finished our game. Who does that?  Let us finish our game!  Then we are walking away and a employee asks us if we want to play another game. Really?  They wouldnt let us finish our game and then they want us to play another one?",

I guess that on Sundays, or at least the day we went our passes were for all day play, so I felt like I got my money's worth for sure.  The food was good, our service was great and the laser tag was so much fun!  I can't wait to go back.  Don't let the rope gravity fool you, if you are afraid of heights it is a bit scary.  I couldn't finish it the first time, but faced my fears and finished the second time!  Overall I thought it was great!",

Tried the \"Fun pass\" for the 5 kids.  It was OK, bowling was bowling, they have soon funny animations on the monitors, but nothing special.  Had a waitress (Ashley) come by as soon as we got to the lane.  I told her we were getting set to start and we'd look over the menu.  No one ever came back by.  Had the kids line up for laser tag only to be told after they stood for 20 minutes they had to get a ticket with a time to play.  45 minute intervals, too long.  Video games are too pricey for what they are.  If I am spending that much, I expect the guest experience to be outstanding, which it isn't.  I will commend Trevor, he was very pleasant and offered information as I was leaving that I never got upon entering and mentioning it was our first time.   Overall I will stick to Dave and Busters or Brunswick, at least they make you and your $$ ($100+) you  spend feel welcomed there.",

    "text": "This place has some potential but has a lot of kinks to work out in order to avoid frustrating the customers.   Pros: The bowling lanes are very cool! They take photos of the bowlers and put them alongside your name on the screen that shows the scores. And they superimpose the faces from your team onto various cartoons during the game. My kids thought this was HILARIOUS.   My kids also loved the interactive video playing on the floor outside the bowling area. I watched jumping on pretend bugs, toppling pretend bowling pins, etc for a long time. They all seemed to love it.   Cons: I was able to watch the interactive video area because I waited nearly an HOUR to be helped at the dining table in the bowling area. I think I would *still* be there if I hadn't sought out a server myself. And there was a cluster of people near the entrance to the bowling area, which was annoying and made it hard to get in and out. I don't know if they were waiting for a lane, or just socializing there bc they had friends playing in the nearby lane, or what?? But the staff should have relocated them and cleared the flow of people in that area.   Also the process of buying a ticket for the gravity ropes course was very confusing. We waited in one line, then were told to move to the other line, which meant we had to go to the back of that line and start the wait all over. The bottleneck also blocked the entrance to the shop.   Let people buy laser tag & ropes course tickets at the kiosks instead! And make sure the staff doesn't ignore people waiting to be served.   Also the nachos were terrible. They were served without salsa (?) and so once you got the few toppings off the top layer, you were left with a stack of chips and nothing to eat them with. The pizza was very good.",

    "text": "$1.65 for games? Change it to credits like Dave n busters so I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off. The food is descent but the service is horrible. If there are a lot of people sitting at the bar or the tables they should have some type of system for anyone to notice us. I waited 15-20 minutes to ask someone to take our order. Bowling is only rented $36 for the hour not per game-RIPOFF-. Expect to spend the whole day if you want to try laser tag or anti gravity walk- there's always a waiting list for 2-3 hours later. The only competition is Dave N Busters and Main Event does not compare especially if you have a children's party like I did. My host was excellent but I had only one host getting drinks for 13 kids and 10 adults and it was hard getting refills. I know I will never host a party there again. This place is good if you're by yourself and just want to get a beer.",

A few friends and I went to have a good time first we stopped at the bar where set sat for a good 15 mins before someone took our order then waited another 10 to get out drinks and it wasn't busy.  Then we paid 17.95 for unlimited bowl and laser tag.  The waiter/waitresses we had were not up to par by a long shot.  No one ever came to us we had to go to them.  The first waiter we had asked for a drink brought it out in a timely manner, after that it went down hill he never came back we had to talk to another \"waitress\" who took for ever to bring two beers then when she finally decided to bring them to is we asked for a lemonade and another beverage she brought one not in a timely manner and \"forgot\" the lemonade.  Had to go add more time to bowl where we told the lady helping us that that the service was not up to par then a manager came over tried to make it right I applaud her effort right after that our lane broke and I asked them to fix it no one came waited like 10 mins then we were all over it  all in all fun place but don't expect any type of customer service.",

Main Event has always proven to be a good time but last weekend, we walked in to a four hour wait just to BOWL.  We figured they were busy and it was a fluke so today, we called to try to make a reservation.  Apparently, you can only reserve a lane 48 hours in advance.  They said there might be a wait but it shouldn't be very long.  When we arrived, we were told we'd have to wait an HOUR AND A HALF for a lane even though there were at least six lanes open that we were told had been reserved for parties that weren't even there.  Screw that.  We will not be back.",

The other menu options sounded good but we didn't get to try them that day. I was sad the menu did not include mozzarella sticks. What kinda bowling place doesn't have mozzarella sticks? I feel this should be a staple at places like these, haha. Drinks were priced okay--decent for this type of spot.  I wish this venue had promotional pricing for their bowling, as it's a little more expensive than usual bowling places. HOWEVER, this was the only place I have been successful at bowling! This place had the lightest bowling ball for my weak ass arms to actually knock some pins down Sweeet! I was thrilled to actually not suck as bad as I usually do at bowling. I would probably come back w my friends because I believe I've found the perfect weight bowling ball for my petite self! Bless.",

It offers bowling, laser tag, arcade area, billiards, obstacle course, restaurant and bar area.  The bowling is excellent, very well lit, offers automatic gutter barriers for kids, table service for food/drinks, and more. The arcade area features two very large classic arcade games, has to be at least 10 feet high, for PacMan/Galaga and Space Invaders. Laser tag and obstacle course also very well done.   The restaurant and bar area also works well for adults waiting for their kids to run out of energy, or money.  Overall a great place for family entertainment.",

    "text": "Woohoo!!! Talk about a fun spot to go! I tagged along with a friend whose daughter was having a birthday party at Main Event this past weekend, and I may or may not have let my inner child run rampant. I probably had more fun there than the kids, haha! I mean, when you walk into a ginormous place that has bowling, arcade, laser tag, pool tables, air hockey, food, drinks (yes, a full bar as well), what more can you ask for?!  The first thing my friend and I noticed was how big and spacious it was... the second thing we noticed is that, even though there were a bunch of kids running around, the place smelled fresh and clean! I've been to other places where it's not pleasant being there because the ventilation is not the greatest and let's face it -- a bunch of kids running around, some still in diapers, etc... I think you get the point. But this place was NOT like that! It was fresh and super clean (thanks Main Event staff! Gold star for you!)   While the kids were bowling, we sat up at the bar and ordered a Pineapple Mojito (I'm not sure that's officially what it's called, but it was a mojito and had pineapple juice in it). We asked our bartender not to make it too sweet, and she nailed it!!! It was sooooo delish! We also ordered some chicken wings that were amazing (there was too much skin on some of them, I thought, but yummy nonetheless). One thing I'd like to see management bring out with the chicken wings though is the little hand wipe towelettes that usually come with them -- they were a bit messy. Maybe? Perhaps?  Then we played some games with the kids and had pizza (which again was pretty dang good! Not cardboardy or fake-tasting, and baked just right). The prizes the kids can \"win\" with their tickets are cool as well.   Definitely a fun place to bring the family and/or friends to hang out, especially in the summer when it gets a wee bit too hot out during the day. Highly recommend!",

We could have bought a whole (better tasting pizza at little caesars) for the cost of this one slice.   After our disappointing dinner we wanted something sweet. We saw that the pizza place had gelato so being huge gelato fans, we decided to give it a try. When the girl behind the counter had a hard time scooping it....we knew something was wrong. Lo and behold we tasted it and found out it was ice cream and not gelato at all. This is False advertising and they should be ashamed of themselves.   We will not be returning.",

Went today and was a little disappointed in some of the details.    They have a game that is for kids to win tickets that is based on a fireman putting out fires (it squirts actual water). It seems like the water was almost completely dried up and little squirts came out here and there between sputtering and bursts of air.  I tracked down one of the employees who was literally playing a game when I was looking for him.  He swiped his card to try it out and was kinda staring at it and half playing it... he just kinda let it go, no offer to put the $1.35 or whatever back on my card, or even a \"sorry about that!  I'll get it fixed now\"  Went to change a diaper in the family bathroom and the changing station is broken to the point where I had to put my knee under the front of it to keep my son from rolling onto the floor while I was changing him.  We played some games that gave out cards and chips instead of tickets and when I took them to cash them in at the prize room (like they do at Dave and Busters) the girl in the prize room told me \"oh!  You use those out there to play the game, we don't cash those in\". I asked how and she said \"honestly I've never played that game... no clue.\"  There is a kiosk where you put them all in and cash them into tickets to put on your card but I had to ask more employees to even find that machine.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience and I would still go back, but it's those little things that can make or break an experience and today definitely wasn't a 5 star visit.",

They had laser tag, bowling, an elevated rope course, video games, interactive floor, and foos ball table. They also serve pizza as well as other foods. They hold corporate events there as well. I'm not sure that I would want attend an adult type meeting there, but that's just me.",

    "text": "Main Event was one of the biggest rip-offs I've ever been to. I went with a friend during their Spring Break promotion. The promotion was $18.95 for unlimited bowling, laser tag, billiards, and gravity ropes. When we arrived, the representative said that laser tag and gravity ropes had a 2 hour wait each. She then stated that bowling had been free all day and we could do that no problem. After shoe rental, the total came to $50 for each of us. We assumed we'd bowl for a bit and by then be able to do the other activities.   When we started bowling, I asked the waitress where the garbage can was and she directed me down the stairs at the end of the ramp. Translation: they don't even have garbage cans at the actual lanes - you have to walk down the ramp and stairs at the center of the alley to even throw food away. We ordered drinks and some appetizers and started bowling. After an hour, our lane shut off. I asked the waitress how to restart it and she went to the front desk and another man came up to us and asked what the problem was. I told him there wasn't a problem - we just couldn't figure out how to restart the lane. He informed us we had to vacate the lane because others were waiting. Keep in mind we've been here for ONE HOUR and the lane next to us wasn't even being used. He said there was now a wait and we had to leave but he'd be \"happy to put us on the wait list\" which was ANOTHER HOUR. When I confronted him, he had a robotic answer of \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" which was obviously insincere. We had just spent $50 for one hour of bowling and would have to wait at least another hour to do another activity. It was an absolute sham.   The funniest part was the waitress who said she AGREED the place was a ripoff and that if she didn't work there, she also wouldn't come because it was too expensive and not worth it.   Needless to say, Dave and Buster's is infinitely better - better food, better pricing, and better customer service.",

Not only did that cut into our bowling time but the fact that we had to ask MULTIPLE times and when we asked why we hadn't seen a waiter the response was, \"I can't find the waiter that is servicing this area\" Horrible response. We didn't even have glasses of water yet and it had been about 30min. I work in customer service and hospitality, this was a horrible response and the fact that the people we asked still couldn't find another server for us. It'll take a lot for me to go back there. They should have found a manager if they couldn't find the server to do their job.",

It was really annoying, the experience was pretty great no doubt, the bartenders were awesome as well as most of the staff at laser tag and gravity. They only have one person in the bowling area so when our lane stopped working it took about 15 minutes for it to be fixed although it was a quick fix it was annoying to wait for help. The first impression is the most important and unfortunately they failed, they are great in most areas but the bad service at the front desk really stuck with me through out my experience.",

The complex is very clean (even saw an employee scrubbing down the arcade games) and features music and fun lighting effects at the lanes. I like how they had the bowling balls organized by weight and size; very organized and easy to find what you want.   Cons: We waited to be helped at the counter and several staff members saw us and didn't come over to help. We paid $30 for one hour of bowling, which seemed a bit steep.",

    "text": "Had my 9 year old sons Birthday party there recently. We had our 10 year old daughters party there this past summer so my son wanted his there. We paid for the bowling/gravity ropes package that included $5 game card and pizza.  Pizza finished early so our host told us we could start gravity ropes early (12:40) and still go till 1:20. We were supposed to start the gravity ropes at 1p.  The guy running the ropes got our kids off at 1p and I asked our host what up? She was arguing with the rope guy and he said our kids had their time and that's it. After all the harnesses were off and at 1:10 we were told kids can go back up till 1:20. Really? By the time I would round them up and get harnesses back on it would be 1:20. I asked for manager.  So manager comes, I explain that host said we would get until 1:20. He repeatedly asked me what do i want him to do. Over and over. I said I want the kids to get 20 more minutes of gravity rope time. No can do, they had another group starting at 1:20. Again he asks me over and over what do I want him to do. I finally ask what will you do? Another host suggests free round of laser tag. Great! Should make her the manager.  One last thing I don't appreciate. When you book a party they tell you how much and that gratuity is included in price. When you get your final bill it has final price and line for tip. Nothing about the \"previously billed 12% service charge\" is listed.  Very cheesy. It is clean there but not the best experience today.",

They went to go eat and their waiter was very rude, from the start but they just kept being polite and had smiles on there faces. When the waiter bought over there drinks he spilled all the drinks all over her friends phone and his clothing, her friend didn't mind at all but the fact of it is, is that the waiter never apologized, all he said was people make mistakes and had a attitude and walked off. When the waiter came back her friend asked to speak with the manager. The manager walked over and he acted like he didn't care either, her friend was still being polite and told the manager he could have at least apologized. The manager then said \"well I can just give you a $5 game card.\" Her friend then said \"no thank you and said I would like a apology sir.\"  The manager than said no. After he said no repeatedly her friend said \"okay I would like my drink for free please\". the manager then said \"oh I see what kind of person you are\" and her friend than said \"I am not any kind of person it's just disrespectful when someone doesn't apologize for something that they did and than to act like they did not care. Especially since he spilled it all over my phone and possibly damaged it, I'm not asking for you to pay for that I'm asking for a apology\". The manager than said \"you guys need to leave or I will call the police because we are fearing for our lives\"!! Her friend than said \"If I was going to do anything I would of said it or done something by now but I didn't, I just want a apology sir!\" The manager than again said, \"I am going to call the police if you do not leave\".   What gets me is that how are 16 year old kids going to make you fear for your life? They are good kids, weather they are at home or in a public place because they all know better. All the kids wanted was a apology and his worker should have apologized as soon as it happened. The managers name was Johnny, but when they asked for the other young mans name the manager said \"you don't need to know it\". Unbelievable!",

The prices here can be pretty hard to stomach, especially if you visit on a Friday evening like we did.  The bowling was so expensive for only one hour!  We were only able to play 1.5 games in that time period.  Make sure you bring a wad of money with you to Main Event, because it will be gone by the end of the night.",

I usually sit down and order food but I had a few kids with me this time so I just went to the little restaurant inside and got a few slices of pizza. BIG mistake. I had to pretty much flag down the girl that was supposed to be working there. She seemed really unintelligent and a little off. Maybe drunk or stoned? Not sure. Her name was tamy or tamera or something along those lines. Either way, I was really annoyed and I just wanted a couple quick slices of pizza. She could barely count my change right. Other than this irritable experience, I love this place. Most of the other employees are awesome and always help me out!",

The price was within my budget so I would highly recommend having any occasion party here since there is so much to do!",

We questioned the front desk on time limit and she said they shouldn't have done that. She got a manager to give us a partial refund. He said he'd have to take my wrist band (but since we weren't done our time doing other things) I suggested a discount on gaming cards. The manager said corporate wouldn't allow him to give us free stuff for no reason. Apparently there was no reason for what happened to us. Then he said he was confused as to what I wanted. I spent $70 in food also. You would've thought they'd make it right. Not ok to take advantage of families.",

Took myself to the bar to order and even then it was hard to get the bartenders attention. A server did come in for her shift later and she immediately greeted me so I did appreciate her hospitality. Still beats Dave and busters prices even though Dave and busters has more games. Food was ok. Both the Burgers and side of fries are very small.",

    "text": "As a last minute birthday celebration for a good friend's daughter (23 years old) 2 lanes were reserved to accommodate family and friends. Our party size was going to grow in numbers at some point as the night went on but the staff and crew were all about making sure we had a good time. It was an all age event and you know kids can't wait to play games and bowl.   Bowling was 1st on deck and I have to point out that our server at the lanes was the reason I'm giving Main Event 5 + 1 stars!! We had about 5 kids (all under 9) show up at different times and he went out of his way to get the kids signed up on the bowling lane and helped to take pictures. If you've ever been, the great thing about the TV's is that they take 3 pictures of you to incorporate into the monitors with videos regarding your results when you bowl. While we as adults were trying to get situated and organized, our server Mario had a great connect with the kids that went beyond any of our expectations. In addition to the kids, he was great with getting orders, remembering the little details and recommending items and purchases that better suited us as a group.   Plenty of bowling and games throughout the evening and even the birthday girl and her friends had a good time. Sure Snapchat was in full effect, but they had a blast hanging out and playing games. When we needed to extend our lane usage for another 1 hour (or 2), each time we approached the staff they would work to make our experience memorable and that was fantastic. Even one of the managers, Roccio,  really stood out and I want to thank her as well for making the experience such a great one my kids.   Food was good from the chicken tenders, burgers, sample platters and surprisingly, the kids mac and cheese. If you have a card from a previous visit make sure to bring it and consolidate it with any of your other cards you pick up. Check out the menu specials where you can get a $20/40 fun card in addition to ordering certain items on the menu at a discount. Laser Tag was great (managed to get in 2 games myself) with only a short wait. Just prepare yourself to be slightly overwhelmed with the prize room as they have tons of items. If you got a kid, plan for 15 mins as they become indecisive thanx to all the goodies they have in the store.   Been here for team builders, but I have to admit, I had more fun with family and friends and will consider returning again in the near future.",

Also a recommendation to the corporate office / management team: STOP REPLYING TO EVERY NEGATIVE REVIEW ON YELP asking for more info. It's stupid And scripted!

I ordered the chicken nachos, as soon as they came out I wished I had ordered something else. The appearance was off putting and the cheese and stale chips weren't any better. I feel like I had better luck in previous attempts but I believe they may have changed the item. In addition to that I think there was a birthday party and a high school class trip there as well. I'm not oppose to them playing  and enjoying themselves but there has to be some sort of order and it was almost as though the laser tag had spilled over into the bar. None of the staff seemed to notice only my son and I as we paused not to get our sticks hit ever time we attempted to shoot.

After checking in for two lane reservations, we were told it would be 1 hr to 1.5 hrs.. as I write this we are at the 2 hr mark. That alone wouldn't be a problem given a Saturday night..   The fun started when we went to get a table to eat dinner while waiting for our lane.  We were greeted at the host stand after a few mins (apparently no host on duty) by a gentlemen who looked like the manager or gm etc.  He was polite and checked on table and came back and said a bday party was clearing out and it would be 10mins. We watched as a family of 5 walked in the entrance and proceeded over to the large table( seats 10-20) and we watched as the waiter just proceeded to serve them.. after again getting up and standing up at the host stand the same manager came over and said it appeared out table was stolen, but offered us a large table immediately in the \"party area\".. ok not the end of the world..  We sat, the first waitress came up after 5 mins and asked what the deal was, we had to ask for menus. She left, another waitress came back with 3 menus(for our group of 10) and then left again only to come back with out more menus to ask us if it would be a split check.  I asked for more menus and she came with approx 20. Then back again to clarify if it was a split check.  From there proceeded to take our drink order and try and get our food order when we had our menus for 30 seconds.   Then after our drinks took 15 mins,  smoothies came with our straws,  beers were spilt on someone in our party, and no waters were offered or brought. Our food showed up in separate groups,  then with the last group, my dish of boneless wings was dropped on the floor!!!!!!!!! At this point I'm thinking we are on a prank tv show to see how far we can be pushed!!! Every one has to ask for cutlery and napkins!  The check close out was ok, but the icing on the cake in all this?  1.  I asked for blue cheese, and got ranch!  2. My original blue cheese is still on the floor as we speak 3. 2.5 hrs and this review we still haven't gotten our lane and have already spent $400 at this establishment!!!!!",

Tonight our server was awesome and asked the manager if we could have another hour because we just got our food.  Because the wait wasn't long they said okay.  Thank you for that.  I just feel that we were spending money by ordering drinks and food that if we are still bowling it should be okay to stay. Two hours to bowl seems more then enough time so I think they should change it and if they do I will move my stars to 5.   We also did laser tag and the rope climbing thing and that was lots of fun.  So overall we still felt like we got our money's worth for buying the wristbands. It was a nice family fun day for us.",

If anyone plans on going on the zero gravity attraction you need shoes (my daughter were flip flops) but they let her use bowling shoes and socks so she could go on it...really great idea since I thought she wouldn't be able to do it as a result.  Would recommend for kids or adults and comeback.",

    "text": "Crummy birthday party packages. My son has wanted to have his party here for a year so he and his friends could play laser tag and gravity ropes. I called to book a package, however if you choose laser tag and gravity ropes it is a one time only through the 15 minute laser tag room and one time only in gravity ropes. Main event pushes for the kids to bowl for an hour instead of laser tag or gravity ropes to fill up time. My son doesn't want to bowl. I can go to Brunswick to bowl! I decided to allow him 5 friends to meet there and buy wristbands instead of a party package. Apparently, the wristband passes end on September 7th (which I was not told that the wristband special ends sept 7th when I called in July to book a party package), so it would be $8 per child per activity. You can do math, it's ridiculous ($48 for 6 kids every time they want to go through laser tag or gravity ropes!!!!). Who could afford that nonsense? My son is so disappointed. It is his big double digit, 10th birthday. Now I'm scrambling to come up with something else after agreeing to this for the past year.",

    "text": "We went here yesterday for the first, and last time. The customer service is absolutely inexcusable. When you first walk in there's a kind gentleman to greet you and that's where the courtesy ends. I have never seen such a disinterested staff. It was as if they were all there against their will. They were poorly trained, they had no customer service skills, and they all just.. Sucked. But that is what confuses me. How can every single one of them be so horrible? Is it the training, the manager, the person who hires them? Looking back, I think maybe it is just the fact that this place is so poorly organized and they feel the stress of the confusion just as we customers did. You see, first we went to one counter to buy a pass.  Then we took that over to an intriguing looking rope course. We get in line for the ropes course and when we get to the front the kid working tells us that we first have to check in at the counter in the room where the kids redeem their prize tickets. So after we waited 20 minutes for all these kids to decide what they wanted to get with their tickets, it's finally our turn to say hey we bought this pass and we're going to go on this ride now is that okay with you? And the girl says sure I can get you on in about 40 minutes. What the hell? There was no one on the course. You buy these passes in blocks of time so if there's a 40 minute wait, I'm only gonna get on once anyway. Side note re: paying in blocks of time- prepay for 3 hours, 5 hours, I'll do that, but to just say you can only pay for up until 4:00 and yet charge me the full price when I come in at 3:00, makes your already high prices highway robbery. Video games look great, they really do they have some brand new state-of-the-art fun looking game but here's the kicker- one game costs $1.63 to play. Another is $1.88. Why not make them one price? And why so expensive??? It was infuriating. I don't know how the food was because my drink was $3.19 and I was done giving them my money.  Overall, the rope course looked kind of neat but this place had not one other redeeming quality and I see no reason to return.",

There was literally nobody in the building, but everything was reserved. If you are going to rent out your business, then post a sign in your door, or maybe let your staff know.",

    "text": "The MOST horrible service ever in the bowling area. Got to our Lane and waited for one of the servers to come take our order. After about 20 mins of waiting and still no server, I had to get up and flag one over myself. She came over, took our order etc etc. After waiting an hour, yes an HOUR.. and not even our drinks had come out but yet seeing everyone else around us getting their food, I finally got up and asked her about our order in which she insisted that it would only take a few more minutes. Okay, understandable. Maybe they're a little backed up in the kitchen? Who knows.   Anyway, after about 15 more mins of waiting she comes over to our table and says \"I'm sorry, but what did you guys order again?\" Uhhh are you kidding me??? I proceeded to tell her and she tells me to just come with her to the register where she puts in my lane number and come to find out there is NO order even inputted into the system under that lane. I asked her if my order was even put in and she assured me that it was and that somebody else probably took my food by mistake. She told me that it would only take 10 mins at the most and everything should be out. At this point, you can imagine how irritated I already am but I go back to my table anyway and continue to wait. Finally, about 15-20 mins later, the food comes out. I ordered the blt Cobb salad and she looks at me and says, \"oh, did you need silverware?\" Why of course not. I was actually planning on eating my salad with my fingers. Like really????? Took her another 5 mins to bring over the silverware and by this time, I honestly lost my appetite.   I have never experienced such awful service before. For the amount of money I spent there today, I expected way more. That experience alone is enough to make me not return.   Btw, the garlic fries are disgusting! They came out practically soaked in oil and looking like they were 3 day old fries that they reheated in the microwave. No thanks!",

    "text": "We decided to take my son who turned 11 here because he wanted to play Laser Tag. We did a Labor Day Weekend deal where you pay 15.95 for unlimited laser tag, bowling, and gravity rope. Mind you on top of the fee for the pass you have to pay about 3.00 to rent shoes for bowling, they do provide complimentary socks if you forgot to bring a pair.   Laser Tag- It was two stories and pretty decent to play for 15 minutes. The kids seemed to enjoy it and the adults.  Bowling- This had to been my most favorite experience. They have a electronic guards that come up for whichever player you select it for. So for the kids we had them put up and for the adults we did not. This made it convenient for us all to bowl how we liked.  Another cool concept was you take three photos and it will appear on the point screen and do little cool animations of your face doing something fun.  Gravity Rope- Very similar to whats at Castle and Coaster if you have been there.   Now for the most terrible part of our trip and reason for the low score.   The food was really good once we got our food and order correct. Granted we did have a large party but I never been to a restaurant and been served so poorly even with a large group. We ordered The Works and they continued to mess our order up. Once they got the toppings correct they still had the size wrong but after waiting over an hour to get my food I did not care I was so hungry. Once the waitress brought the correct pizza she said with a sassy attitude, \"Heres The Works with NO MEATBALLS AND NO OLIVES.\" Then goes to slam down our pizza like we were the worst customers. My fiancee asked for the manager twice and at the end when we were leaving he offered us play cards but we were leaving why would we want to stay after all we went through. They also charge you up front for the food before getting it. I think they do that so once you pay they can treat you like dirt. I never been treated so poorly at an establishment before.",

I personally wouldn't try this place again but if your looking to take the family out, your kids would have a blast. There is a lot for them here and you can enjoy a beer. Little pricey game wise too.",

Even when there isn't that many people around the bar you still have to wait forever to get a drink. The prices are pretty steep as well. Last night I was there and had been waiting to be served and instead of helping me and all of the others at the bar, the employees were having a whipped cream fight. Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse, the manager came by to take my drink order. I think his name was Casey or Cory or something with a C. He was the biggest asshole I had ever ran into as a server. I asked what they had in bottles and he just said \"a lot\" and that was it. Really dude?! That's so helpful. He totally acted like I was taking up his time by being there. Next time I go to main event, I will for sure be pre-gaming.",

Then after one hour they kick us off because other people are on a \"waiting list\" to  bowl. The staff did NOT say that would happen if there was a waiting list. I don't care, my mother in law just paid $180 for ONE flipping hour! We tried to speak to one of the  managers, Jim. But he just wrote it off like it was no big deal and got in my cousin's face when he was asking about us being kicked out. He LITERALLY got up in his face. Jim's behavior was very rude and unprofessional. He should be fired in my opinion.  Don't waste your time or money with this place. They'll just screw you over! It was pitiful and not to mention very few lanes, crappy set up!",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night for a birthday. We sat in the bar (which is open seating) while we waited for our bowling lane to open (2 and a half our wait) and waited patiently for a server to come by to get out drink order. I had to stop two servers and even the manager over the course of an hour to get someone over to out table to get one round of drinks in. The manager was good for nothing and basically told me \"everyone sat down at once, what do you want me to do?\". Hm, I don't know, how about your job? Then when our server finally made it to our table she greeted us with \"I've been here since 11 so I'm going to cash you guys out right away so I can leave\". Super professional. So after we receive one round of drinks we sit there for another HOUR while waiting for our new server to acknowledge us so we could order food. Finally Wes came to our saving grace after I stopped him while walking by. He got our food and drink order in immediately and apologized for the terrible service. Unfortunately that's all he would do for us. Our other server Chandler couldn't care less about us and we waited 45 for our drinks to get to our table. We received our food and finished eating before we could even get drinks. This was by far the worst service I've ever received and extremely poorly managed. Wes, you deserve to be promoted to manager.",

I agree that the bowling prices are insane, but they do have some great specials.  You just have to look for them and get them at their ticket booth, I suppose.    We walked around the arcade, took some fun pictures and got some game cards.  Games are anywhere from $1.10 to $1.65 in some cases.    I'm sure they are still working out some kinks, being open only a month.  Will definitely give it another go around here down the road.    Compared to Brunswick Zone in Gilbert, I'd have to give Main Even a nod on the side of not a bunch of rugrats running around, but the bar at Brunswick is more self contained, which is a plus for them.  And they (Brunswick) have karakoe.",

The place was dead and i can see why with the customer service that is close to nonexistent at this location.

    "text": "I took my two nieces here for the first time this evening as a summer break activity.  The Monday Madness was a pretty good deal as they were able to play unlimited video games for only $10.95.  I am not too interested in gaming so I cannot really comment how up to date the selection of games were.  But the girls really enjoyed them.   Now for the food.  I had the California Chicken sandwich.  On the menu it called for sun dried tomatoes and pesto mayo.  I asked to have fresh tomatoes and regular mayo instead and this is when the train went off the tracks.  The waiter had to come back three times to clarify what l actually wanted.  When the food finally came to the table, after an unusually long wait, they got the mayo and tomatoes correct, but forgot the avocado that was also supposed to be on there.  Once half through the sandwich,  I received my avocado on the side.  Also, I paid extra to get a garden salad instead of fries.  The salad was on the plate with my sandwich, which should not be a big deal, however the plate was almost too hot to touch so my green salad was sitting there cooking on it.  This also tells me that the long wait for our food was the result of that food sitting in the window for way too long.   The kids meals were OK and seemed priced right for the portion, but buy drinks for the kids in the pizza area before sitting in the main eating area.   You will have to get your own refills, but they will have a foam cup with a lid and straw instead of a heavy bar glass.   I might go back, but will certainly eat elsewhere before going.",

    "text": "Not impressed! My sister and her kids were in town and wanted to get the kids and adults together. We decided on main event looked online and it was $14.95 a kid for all you can play from open until 5 PM excluding a few thing. Sounded like a good deal met up at the Tempe location and go up to pay and were told they had a private event starting at 2PM. I asked if there was a discount since we were only getting approximately 2 hours of play instead of 5 and of course it was NO, pay or leave. Since the other location was about forty minutes away and kids were exciting we gave in. Again we looked on the website before going and no mention of private event and closing at 2 PM. At least offer a discount or an apology. That was the first and last time we will go to Main Event!",

    "text": "Great experience and great price!  I was somewhat hesitant to go to this establishment because of the high number of bad reviews (most regarding food and service).  We did not eat there for this reason.  We only participated in the laser tag.    The prices listed inside were higher than those listed on the website, so make sure to ask about the $7 per person unlimited event deal (assuming the offer is still valid when you read this).  Everything appeared relatively clean (3 of the 5 toilet stalls in the men's bathroom appeared freshly cleaned...not bad for having a bunch of young boys running around!).  The girl who signed us up for laser tag spoke EXTREMELY fast.  She was very busy as she was working two stations, event sign up AND the video game ticket prize counter.  That said, she was thorough and pleasant.  The laser tag battleground has two levels, with great places to post up and hide.  The lasers are the visible type, and are reminiscent of a laser pointer pen in smoke (i.e. you can see the full length of the beam).  I've played others types that are not visible, and those are nowhere near as fun.  Each game takes about 10-15 minutes.  We played 4 games between 7:30 and 9:00 (kids had to use the bathroom).  Bottomline, we got what we came for:  Lots of fun playing laser tag at a great price (exactly $7 per person plus tax, so 3 people cost $22.70).",

We did not try any of the food offerings, we had plans after. The weird thing is they let you bowl for an hour at a time and when you finish your first game, you get into a second game, but don't have a chance to finish it.  My advice, save your money and go to Peter Piper Pizza, it's cheaper and just as fun for the kids.",

    "text": "My hubby took me here for one of our date days...but the only reason why we were able to go was because of the deal they are having for May and June.  For $20 you can get a bracelet worth $40 in game play or you get can get unlimited play for the laser tag/bowling/sky rope course/pool...but only during the 4-hour slot from either 11-4 or 5-9.  We had thought it was unlimited every thing.  Meh.  We decided to get the video games bracelet because we didn't want to just play bowling, pool, and laser tag when we could have done that elsewhere for cheaper.    They do have a fun variety of games...the best being those that are app games like a huge Fruit Ninja and Temple Run.  It's too bad the freaky 3-D zombie game only had one set of 3-D glasses...because it could have been much scarier.  Main Event also has the typical games you could find at Dave and Busters, so we played several of those as well.    We didn't have any of their food or drinks.  But this is a new facility that is pretty clean...for now.  I would have preferred just going to D&B because of the no kids allowed after a certain hour.  It was a bit of a pain to try to and wait for certain games and have kids cut in front of you.    I doubt we will be going back since outside of the deal we got it's pretty dang expensive.",

We literally played 2 rounds of bowling. Well the kids did. The staff, as I see mentioned in other reviews, was in fact really rude. One girl literally rolled her eyes with a heavy sigh because I had to try a few different sized bowling shoes for my daughter (they run about 2 sizes too small). Didn't realize I was completely putting her out. ((Shrug)). I gave two stars because the food is actually pretty good there and reasonably priced. Sorry though we don't intend to return.",

    "text": "Took my 14 year old daughter and several of her friends (both boys and girls) for her birthday.  We bought a birthday package that included and hour of bowling, a game of laser tag and a $10 game card.  It also included a personal meal for each person (pizza, chicken fingers or sliders and a drink)  We also ended up adding on an extra game of laser tag for everyone and the rope course.  The extra game of laser tag and the rope course were $8 each per person.    We were met at the door by our party coordinator, Dana, who was as nice and helpful as could be.  She took the kids shoe sizes and food orders, took them to get bowling shoes and then took them to the lanes.   They ate while they bowled.  They were then taken over to the laser tag and I think this was their favorite activity.  There are two levels, lots of places to hide and a couple different game modes to choose from.  They then went to the rope course which was challenging but doable.  Dana then took the kids back to a table for cake - they provide the plates, napkins, serving utensils and candles.   The kids were then let loose to play in the arcade.    My impressions:  The place is very loud and pretty large.  Our party started at 4pm which was perfect.  By the time the party was over at 6:30, it was starting to get very busy with lots of older teens and young adults.  The kids said the food was good - not spectacular but, good.  The party package was reasonable and it was nice to have a party planner with us.  My only issue is that they have a 10 person minimum.  That means 5 people per lane of bowling.  You don't get much bowling in with that number of people.  Also, as kids get older, their circle of friends gets smaller so I think a better minimum would be 8.  We actually had 2 people cancel at the last minute and we still had to pay for 10 regardless.  I think 8 people would be much more reasonable.    Both the boys and the girls said they had an absolute blast.  I think this is a place were young kids, teens and adults would have a great time.  But, I also think our experience was made better by have a planned party with everything organized so there was no waiting - everything was already scheduled which definitely helped.",

He said he had to go run a card and then he'd be back. When he came back around he went and helped two other tables that JUST sat down. Got our food, ate, and waited 15 minutes to ask for our check. Took another 10 minutes before he brought it. Then my friend spent $10 playing a game that wound up not loading the credits to her card despite multiple wins and also once took money without spitting out the coins to play. She told a guy who offered to comp her a play. When we replied that the tickets didn't load he asked, \"How do you know?\" with an attitude. Yeah, we'd checked the balance, so we knew. When we asked what the point of comping a play was if those tickets didn't load, he said, \"I don't know,\" and walked away. He should have given her another card or maybe told someone the machine needed a repair. And we checked again 20 minutes later and the tickets still weren't added so it wasn't that it took time to  load. There was a two hour wait for bowling. Overall, pretty lackluster experience.",

    "text": "How I feel about this place: Ehhhhhhhhh....... Yea.  I've been here twice now. The first time we checked out everything other than laser tag. We bowled which I enjoyed, played games, and even went on the tall ropes thing above the games (I got off right away because it was scary lol). This place is pretty nice, its huge and even though its super packed you can't tell much because of the space.  What I have noticed is it's pretty much a rip off. You expect the games to have similar pricing to somewhere like Peter Piper. No, they're way overpriced. Most games are over $1 to play just once.... and it's not like the toys you have to choose from with your tickets are anything great.  The bowling is nice, the seating in the areas are great and you can even take photos to put up on the screen when all the funny little clips come on while bowling. The only thing that sucks about the bowling is it seems that the time starts the second your buzzer goes off. So you have to find your lane, get shoes and find a ball all while your time is ticking away, so that seems pretty unfair. Not to mention the wait is really long! Like an hour + long. If you want to play multiple times and get your money's worth I would suggest someone in your group sign up for another buzzer right when your first buzzer goes off so by the time you end bowling you're closer to being able to start again.   From what we tried food/drink wise everything seems really good! This time I ordered some of their mixed drinks and was surprised I liked every drink I ordered. It does seem like they need more servers in the eating areas. I ordered fries and a drink before my friends who ordered full on meals. All their meals came out quick and tasted great. However, it took close to 40 minutes just to get a drink and fries. I'm not someone who complains at all because I can understand how hard it must be to serve so many people and know customers can be over needy. My friend's mom ended up noticing and asked two different people why I did not have my order. I felt bad for our server because she seemed overwhelmed but her service was great.   I will probably go back if invited. But this is not somewhere I would choose personally to host a party. I wouldn't suggest it for children either, definitely geared toward adults.",

Then they took way too long with our food and drinks. When we tried to play the billiards they sent us from the front desk to the bar and back. Wouldn't let us pay so we could get a table. When we needed refills they still ignored us. Nobody ever helped up. Never coming here again.",

Spacious and open, you don't feel like you're tripping over the little peanuts.There's plenty to keep the kids entertained from the interactive games to the mesmerizing moving floor. With a very well stocked bar, there's pool and bowling to keep you from going stir crazy. Food was surprisingly good and moderately priced. The bowling was definitely my fave part because of the animated cartoons in between each player. Pure utter entertainment. Love seeing your personalized selfies become animated clips of \"cheer squad.\" If I wasn't in my sundress, I would recommend strapping on the harness and doing the obstacle course so you get a bird's eye view of everyone below. Definitely coming back as a group outing or family get together; on side note, perfect for teambuilding event too.",

It was a chore to be acknowledged at the bar, our server never came after repeated requests, and there were bar glasses and food all over the pool table area. No one picked up after any of the tables when people left. The pole tables and pool sticks were disgusting and greasy everything was a mess. Everything was expensive as hell too. Also while the bar was getting \"slammed\" the manager is just standing around in the kitchen not doing shit. Don't come here. Horrible service and not worth the money or the wait.",

We did have an incident where a lane was not operable and the attendant failed to block off the lanes properly while it was being fixed. As a result, someone in our group bowled in the lane next to it without knowing that she wasn't supposed to and the attendant was very rude to her and made a very nice, sweet-hearted, young woman cry - that's a no-go.   Also, not all the gear for laser tag was operable so we kept having to switch gears. I personally had to switch twice and the third still was not working properly during the game.",

With the exception of the waitress a heavier set girl who did great at hosting us on the dining side.  Do not waste your money or time there. I was trying to get my name down for the bowling which was over an hour wait and the young girl that does the bowling sign ups was Insisting I couldn't get on the list (not sure why cause we had the unlimited wrist bands). She kept getting worked up and gave me the NASTIEST attitude, that I had to tell her to relax. To say the least she got so worked up and acted like she was ready to fight. I had to remind her she was at work and her coworkers had to push her back. Meanwhile the MANAGER - was standing right next to her the whole time and not once spoke up to intervene GHETTO!! She eventually got pulled away and some other girl was able to assist me, she herself didn't seem to happy to help. The whole time I was there she was talking about me with her friends and mugging me. Mind you I'm just there trying to have fun with my family and the kids,  I would've put her in her place had she really stepped up to me, that's how crazy it was. I ain't mad at her for her foolishness- life will teach her but the managers IGNORANCE is the problem. The Manager not once apologized for the behavior.   Anyways this place has 0 customer service, I witnessed the other manager on the food side snatching the pins away from the children when they were playing on the shuffleboard. Couldn't even say anything just straight snatched. Their employees must HATE their lives there cause that's the attitude they walk around with. If you buy the unlimited wrist band it's a waste of time as you have to sign up for the only 3 things you can do and its at least an hour wait in between No wonder they only have 3 stars!!!! Go to Gilbert or other location where the people treat you like your money is green!!",

Good luck girl.   We all highly understanding about her training, the fact it is a Friday night and it is the summer cool.   The group starts arriving at 8:30pm.   After sitting for half an hour we are asked if we'd like to order drinks. Another 30mins go by and we have to hunt them down to order food.   The entire table order was taken instead of mine. Cool. They are busy, it is loud, got it.   Water is given to folks at the table. I flag Drew down to put in an order and he quickly  scurried away. Okay that was the 2nd time.   3rd time a friend flags down Drew and explains I wanted to put in an order. I express to him get I've tried twice already and was either ignored or overlooked.   That's when it gets interesting. . Drew decides to get an attitude.  \"Okay. So. What do you want?\"   I say \"Excuse me\"  His face draws in , brows lower and tone gets more irritated. \"What do you want to order?\"  Not that attitude Drew. No thanks. Requested a manager. She came within 5 minutes and pulled him to the side.   The manager seemed to be understanding and asked if I wanted to place an order. At that point I am over this place.   After her talk with him, the crowds starts to die down in that area and he realizes he may actually want a tip. All of a sudden he can double and triple check if anyone needs something. .  All in all. Based off this service I do not plan on returning. #DaveAndBusters!",

We end up spending hours together here.. some games are so addictive that we keep going on and on until our funds on the card give up on us!   There is ample parking here and a decent restaurant. The wait time to play any game is decent too.  Make sure you take a picture of your card or keep the card number noted somewhere Incase you decide to accumulate points. (We lost ours and there's no way to trace it using your credit card) :(  We visited this place on the Memorial Day weekend last. They had an offer going on so we opted for the $32 offer which had a $30 credit towards games and a free entree. Husband decided to order the boneless wings (AGAIN!!!) with lemon pepper & fries. We thought it would be a sauce but turns out it was dry spice. We asked for their mango habanero & Korean sauce on the side & they obliged. The sauce was yummy- I ate most of it with my fries.",

I hope that they were maybe just having an off day and this was what caused us to experience what we did today.  My friend and I showed up for my friends birthday and were not so warmly greeted by the sever who will remain nameless here. We never received silverware and the service was slow and lack luster. Overall we just felt virtually ignored by our server. And we just felt like he never really wanted to serve us or really just be there. Our food took forever to come out and when it did it was not that good. Most of us ended up sending our food back or leaving it on the table. Three of us decided to share the sampler platter, which came with cheese curds, wings, and spinach and artichoke dip. The food was not super warm, but tasted okay. The boneless wings were the best part of the platter. I got the honey sriracha bbq sauce--which had just a hint of spice and was not overly sweet. The cheese curds got super hard once they got cold and were not good.   To drink I got the sangria swirl, which was not good and got the long island peach tea instead, which was better, but still just okay. When I asked our server about exchanging it for something else he was not very happy about helping me with this.  Overall I would not return to Main Event for the food and the service, but for the games and fun atmosphere. This is still a cool place to play.",

We like to play down clown a lot followed  by basketball and match the color. They also have other games like laser tag, bowling, pool and shuffle board. You play better you earn tickets and then you can pick gifts from the shop based on tickets value. They had some offer yesterday one entree and $30 game   You pay $32ish which was a good deal. We ordered wings for appetizer and flavor was lemon pepper. It was okay could have been better. But we did ask for mango habenaro and soy garlic sauce which added some flavors. It's a good place to come in groups and have some fun. They have enough parking spots and it's closer to i10 if someone needs that info too.",

It took a while to get a beer and I was carded three different times by the same bartender.   Safety first?  It was a Friday so this place was packed to the brim with kids.  I can usually handle this but for some reason, this was next level kid frenzy.  We spent some time playing around in the arcade-- buck hunter, skee ball, air hockey.  The arcade was really sticky and a little trashed.  Machines need to be wiped down a little bit.  We also had a couple of kids trailing us, asking for money to play games.  Weird.  Where are your parents?    The lanes aren't the best!  You only are allowed an hour block so that was a little frustrating.  Especially when kids were running in and out of our lane.  Still had a really fun time.  Would recommend.  Especially if you are a parent who doesn't want to watch their kids for a couple of hours.",

From arcade games to laser tag, bowling to gravity ropes, and likely a handful of other activities I didn't even see on a recent visit, this place seems to have it all.  A restaurant with a full bar + wifi included!  This Main Event location is a good 20 minute drive from me, but it's definitely a hot spot for birthday parties, and the kids love it.  I recently took my kids to a party that included bowling and laser tag.  We walked in and were completely overwhelmed right away.  The parking lot is huge, as is the facility.  There is so much going on when you enter, it's hard to decide where to head first!  It took about 5 minutes (but felt like 10) for us to find our party in the bowling area, and the staff I encountered as I searched with two kids in tow were not very helpful.  Once we found our group, the kids jumped in on a bumper bowling game, which was perfect for them.  Following bowling, was pizza, and then the kids were each given a $5 arcade game card that got them a few games each... (note: arcade games are super pricey!)  I ended up adding $10 more to each of their cards after a debacle with a credit card machine that didn't work and some staff that were not the most attentive when asked.  Once we figured it out, we played a few more games which resulted in us practically missing the laser tag part of the party.  We checked in the \"store\" to see what the kids could get in exchange for the points awarded from the games they played, and sadly, it wasn't much... mostly candy like taffy, which they love but their dentist does not!  Last up, was cake... sugar, much?!  The kids had a blast, especially the birthday boy, but I left with a headache and we were all exhausted.  I am sure we'll be back, but I may have my husband take the kids next time!",

Was worthless because we only played like 1/4 of the games. Either they were out of order, or didn't work properly. We started to play games but then they wouldn't work. Some games we didn't even want to play because they were dirty. People leaving drinks and open candy wrappers everywhere.  4) The trash in the bathrooms were overloading with paper towels!   Overall the building is nice, but they are not taking care of the inside or their customers. Disappointed.

    "text": "Main Event has something for people of all ages. Arcade games (with tickets that you can redeem for prizes), bowling, laser-tag, billiards, shuffleboard, and a high ropes course. On top of all that, they also have a restaurant inside that you can get food at between games. Definitely a good place for a birthday party for youth kids--as it has everything they'd enjoy.   I've been here multiple times and have done something every time and have always been able to be pretty entertained. The downside of Main Event is that they because they have so many things to do, their customer service is spread pretty thin. We went for bowling yesterday, and rented 3 lanes for two hours. At one point, one of the lanes wouldn't reset/rerack the pins. The button wasn't working, and the \"call for service\" kept saying that all of their customer service reps were busy at the moment. We had to ask out waitress to get somebody to help us. But after 20 minutes of waiting, they finally came to fix it.   Another small issue that wasn't too big of a deal, but still was an inconvenience to us, was waiting on our waitress. We finished bowling and were packing up when we gave her our payments for the food we had ordered. But we still had to wait around for 10-15 minutes until she came back with our change/credit cards.   Overall, Main Event is a great place to hang out. They have lots of different activities for you to do and keep yourself entertained. But that's also their problem. They have a lot of everything, but don't really excel at any one thing.",

We set the bar area occupying some of the high tops And there were 7 of us. We ordered our drink , appetizers and dinner. We all went with the special that provided us $20.00 game cards for later.  When the food arrived all the steaks were cooked wrong, they promptly took them back to replace them. Well.... they remade all the steaks but two were still wrong. This happened two more times, finally after what seemed like hours which was probably it actually was, we finished dinner.  When our check arrived the manager completely compted all the food for our group and gave us  each an additional $20.00 game cards. They did what was right and made a bad situation better. The rest of the night was uneventful, other than adult game time. I will definitely come back due to the how the management recovered the evening.",

However they did give us a nice private room with a big Screen TV.  After our 1 hour in a private room we were taken to go bowling.  Our shoe rental was included in our package.  We had 2 lanes reserved for an hour & a half.  We were able to bowl 2 full games.  Our time actually ran out prior to the second game ending and they extended our time so we could finish.   We then went and played a game laser tag which was super fun.  The laser tag game lasted like 12-15minutes.  We all also got a $10 arcade card.  So we played games for about 30 minutes.   Also throughout the whole night we had an unlimited beverage package (non alcoholic) and we had drinks on demand.  Super nice.  After the arcade we reserved 2 pool tables and played some pool.  We spent 5 hours here and it went by rather fast.  Total bill was $452 for 10 people and I tipped our host $50.  Overall it was a super fun place with a great atmosphere and environment.  Our Host MICHAEL was Amazing!!!   Service was on point and great staff.  If the food would have been a bit better it would have 5 stars.",

The banquet food was meh- we had BBQ but the only thing I could eat since being a vegetarian was the cornbread and salad. The salad was limp and sad. Oh well- again it was free to me so I didn't want to complain.  They have good variety of games but they seemed a tad pricey if I had to pay for it myself. We also had a dedicated bowling lane for 4 hours. Which was little impressive -maybe I'm behind on the bowling alley technology but you take a photo and they use your face in the silly animations on the screen when you get strikes etc. A long way from pencil and paper! We were able to play laser tag as a group which was a lot of fun. I never had the desire to play ever but since it was free why not?! Surprisingly! I had a great time! It's two levels so you can pick off people below. A few of my co-works said their gun didn't work or wasn't working right - this was a little frustrating for them but I had no problems the two times I played. They also have several pool tables but didn't get the chance to play.  I wasn't brave enough to do the catwalk thingy but my co-workers said it was fun and scary if you're afraid of heights like me.  I would like to go back but only when they have specials or during off hours -it seems like this place could get busy on the weekends. No thanks.  Overall it was a great night out for us.",

I went this past Saturday with my boyfriend, his parents, his sister and her boyfriend, and our two friends. It was free to get in, just like at D&B. But then you have to pay for games and stuff. We started with a $35 card. The games are all a lot like D&B games. They also have bowling, laser tag, a pizza/gelato area and a pool table area. I had a lot of fun. We played this one game where you have to touch all the lights when a bubble thing would like up and get as many as you can compared to your opponent. We played that numerous times. And of course air hockey which is one of my favorite games. We played one round of laser tag which was a ton of fun!! We were gonna bowl but it was $36 an hour. I think that was per group but still.. The bar is in between the pool area and the pizza/gelato area. After laser tag we sat down and I got a gelato to split with my boyfriend. Let me just make a shout out to a girl named Hanna there.. She works in the gelato/pizza station and she was super friendly and helpful. I hope she gets recognized for that. Definitely found one of my favorite gelato flavors because of her. It was the salted caramel. I wanted to sample a couple different flavors and she was super nice about it and friendly. So definitely talk to her. And to end the night my boyfriend and our two friends played a game of pool. We lost both times against them haha. But overall I had a fun night at this place. Everyone should check this place out.",

I think it's going to be great for adults who want to let loose with bowling and pool, great for parties, but not the best for families with young kids.  The reason I say that is because it's simply too pricey. I went there tonight with my husband and son. We wanted to bowl for an hour, and it was $34 for an hour. What? Fifty cents per minute of bowling? I was hoping we could get the early-bird rate of $22 per hour, but was told that that pricing ended at 5 p.m. I checked my cell phone as I was being told this, and it was 5:03. OK, so this is going to be THAT kind of place.  So we got our game, and with shoe rental and tax it ended up about $44 for an hour. Bowling is very high-tech, with the ability to choose different types of games and even different ways to decorate your screen.  The food is fairly reasonable. We had a child's chicken finger meal, a margarita flatbread, chicken wings and three Coronas and the total was $50. The chicken wings were so soggy that my husband sent them back (the first time I've seen him do this in 11 years of marriage). They graciously made new wings for him. They still charged us for it, but that's fine, I have no problem with that.  So we left after less than two hours having shelled out more than $100 (with tip). Yikes.  We didn't play any video games, but the ones I saw were about $1.10 or more per play. Your kids will go through the cash pretty quickly at that rate.  The service is absolutely impeccable. The wait staff is a constant presence at the bowling area and was there to help with anything and everything. The food was served on nice plateware, and the paper napkins were black. They brought out lemon slices in a small bowl with our ice water -- a very nice touch.  Pros: Very high tech, good-looking, clean and well run. Lots of friendly employees. Food and drinks are reasonable.   Cons: Bowling and video games are extremely expensive. I just can't pay $44 for an hour of bowling for a family of three.",

The biggest problem with the place is the staff, it's like they are all just sick of working there. Been here once. I came here for a birthday party. Games are okay.. Food was what I expected. Service was just plain horrible, both at the bar and tables. God awful customer service in the bar area. I waited at the bar over 15 minutes just to get a beer, bartender just talking with one customer knowing that I'm here waiting for him to finish the conversation.. Finally asks me for help.. Got my beer tip him couple dollars just leaves it on the table not even saying thank you. I never experienced anything like it.. rude rude rude! Don't come here if you want to have a good time. Businesses who doesn't appreciate customers don't deserve to be in business!! The place in general is lacking customer service. It almost seems like all they want is for you to get in the door and past that nothing matters. Everyone in our party left feeling like we never want to go back.",

I participate in a \"fun\" bowling league at the Tempe location. The last two weeks we have had to wait for regular customers to finish bowling. Most places would not put people on league lanes within an hour of the league start time. If you are a regular league bowler, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time, even for fun. The lanes are ALWAYS filthy, they do not oil the lanes, the carpeted areas near the lanes smell horrible, and good luck getting a coaster with the overpriced drinks. The bathrooms are rarely clean or properly stocked. Ladies, bring your own toilet paper! Food is average and drinks are overpriced. There are two weeks left in our league and I can't wait for it to be over. After this league, I will never enter this place again.",

They basically messed up 2 of the orders apologized but considering the type of error I felt an apology was not enough.  I had a hambuger as 2 others did and we all thought the fries were way too salty.  The hamburger looked nothing like its picture and was completely hidden inside the bun.  Ended up tossing the bun.  Bottom line, not a place I would go for food but the facitlity is impressive.  I'm afraid the individual costs of each game is high and priced weird.  Probably best to get some sort of package deal.",

But you don't know what surprise you're in for! We had a group of 5 all purchasing the wristband spending about $125.   A couple reasons why this place is getting a bad review. 1) it's not even busy and they tell you 2 hour waiting listen to bowl. 2) it's not really convenient to order food and keep getting moved around and move lanes if you're bowling. 3) no one really has all day to get on a wait list, so that is where they rip off your party. 4) the service is just ok 5) it's actually cheaper paying for what you want to play. For example, we bowled 3x, it would have only been $90 average instead of getting the wristband.   It's not busy and they make you wait 2 hours! Wow! Rip off! See the photo!",

    "text": "Main Event is a blast. Pricey, but a blast.   Main Event is a Dave and Busters style entertainment complex principally featuring bowling, laser tag, a rope climbing course, and arcade games. The place is rather high end, but not excessively so- theres table side service at the bowling alley, but not to the extent seen at posher places (a welcome relief, multiple course meals need not be at a bowling alley).  Thankfully, everything is super clean.   The price of entry here can be on a per-game or unlimited pass basis. The former is about $6/person for laser tag or ropes and $26/hour for bowling or something like $40+ per person for unlimited. In other words, you can easily make things cheaper with the unlimited pass, if you have the stamina.   The food here is good for bowling alley food. I would not want anything simpler or more complex. I tried the garlic fries, which were slathered in butter. Normally, that would be a problem... but they were delicious.  There is also lots of alcohol available, though I wouldn't recommend drinking it in conjunction with some of the more energetic games (e.g. laser tag).   The laser tag here is manic and fun. I couldn't help but shake the idea that some people were way into it and played it way too much, but that added to it. It was fun to get my butt kicked! Note, however, that the place had major stank - some people had overwhelming BO.   Bowling was great. The lanes were excellent, the machines fast and fun, and the software on the scoreboard was entertaining (you can take pictures and get statistics!).   The arcade games are good but could be better. No DDR, but Pump it Up was present. Lots of ticket games, which are kinda lame. The driving games were a blast. All machines are retrofitted with credit card like readers, which might have been done to add price - a single driving game was $1.75(!)  All in all, this place was an expensive blast.",

Initially, the place looked great. It was clean and a nice facility. It was when I had to interact with staff from getting my shoes, to requesting a server to come to our lane where we were bowling numerous numerous times and being IGNORED that I was immediately turned off. Even the bartenders at the bar were rude and behaved as through they didn't want to be there. We had 1 server who was actually professional, friendly, helpful and attentive. Not sure how this business trains their employees or what the environment is here but there appeared to be a lot of unhappy employees who had no interest in tending to customers. At least this is how I felt. But rather than complain I let it be as we were there celebrating a great occasion. I told my family and friends to not ever go to this place unless you want to be ignored and not tended too. Personally, it's ridiculous considering the amount of money they charge for their bowling lanes, food and drink. I'd expect better customer service. But lesson learned, I will never go back to this place again. I'll stick to bowling alleys where the prices are more reasonable and staff are better equipped to tend to its patrons. I may go ahead and submit a letter of concern to the district manager of this place as it's not right to be treated as such. So should you patronize this location and establishment - BEWARE!",

She got us a bowling lane quickly and helped clear everything up.

We also got the BIG Lucky Strike Combo appetizer sampler, and that could have easily served eight people.  The platter included Buffalo Wings, mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, sliders, tortilla chips with salsa, spinach dip and a queso dip.  While we only sat and drank, the activity selection was dazzling.  I saw video games, bowling, laser tag and something they call Gravity Ropes (an elevated roper ladder type of climbing structure).  It was late afternoon so there weren't too many patrons, but everyone looked like they were having a good time.  Overall we had a good visit, my only issue to bring up was that the volume of music blasting overhead was so loud that our group had to shout at each other just to communicate, which doesn't make for a very sociable outing.  Making the music louder doesn't automatically equate to a more fun environment; the two are not directly proportionate.    I'd suggest maybe turning down the speaker volume from an 11 to a 8.",

I can really only comment on the staff that I interacted with. When we were leaving, I grabbed a bunch of literature off the wall near the entrance/exit. As we were leaving a young man approached us and asked if I had any questions. I said I was fine and thanked him for asking. He told us to have a great weekend. Nice.  The bathroom was clean and the facility is really very large. The only other comment I can make is that when we walked in, I didn't realize this place is like a bar on steroids. There were a lot, well over 100, older men and women just sort of hanging around the bar area. I could tell they were in smaller groups so I don't think they were all from the same company. I never would have imagined this place was a \"hang out after work\" kind of place. Whoda thunk it.  That being said, I think the facility was very clean and seemed like a fun place. One of the pamphlets I grabbed was a birthday price list. It does seem rather expensive so be forewarned.   C had a great time bowling and playing laser tag. 3 Stars.",

Not surprised, but still thought I should note it. The bowling was on a 1 hour wait.  Once we got our lane, it had technical issues.  We flagged down Kayce.  She is the ONLY positive thing about this place.  Kayce got a lane dude to look into the issue,  it still didn't work so she moved us to another lane.  I wanted a refill on my Stella.  Asked some dude in a blue shirt, nothing. Asked another dude in a shirt practically begging for another beer wanting to give my money to someone in exchange for alcohol. Nothing. Again, KAYCE, promptly delivered.   Long story short.  It was very frustrating to have a group of adults go out who are all busy living lives and wanting a night out.  Some young \"manager\" attempted to salvage the experience through our bills, but we will absolutely never return.  Terrible.",

    "text": "Brought my three kids here for an afternoon of games and fun. Overall was very disappointed.Had a hard time finishing a single bowling game before we were kicked off our lane. We tried twice. If you purchase a unlimited wrist band, they limit your time. We had 6 people, 3 kids, and they would not allow us to be on 2 lanes, even though there were multiple lanes open 85% of the time. Our games were always stopped before we could finish. The Lazer Tag was fun, but the equipment was very dirty. The Video Games are expensive if you don't buy an unlimited video game deal. They start at $1.65 per game.  The ambiance is very similar to Dave and Busters or Peter Piper Pizza, but leans heavily more toward a Peter Piper Pizza with a couple more adult friendly attractions.",

We were there at least 3 hours so was a great value. We had to wait a long time for a bowling lane to open but we kept busy with laser tag and games so it wasn't a big deal even though we mostly wanted to bowl. It's nice that they give you a buzzer that goes off when your bowling lane is ready. Customer service is lacking though. Employees seem inattentive especially in the bowling area. Arcade games are pricey in my opinion. Despite that will definitely be back to have some fun!",

    "text": "Came here with some work friends for some bowling on a Monday night, brought my kids as well since it was \"all you can play\" in the arcade. I purchased meals for all my kids and my friends also ordered food.   We had to go multiple times to the front desk to have our bowling lane \"fixed\" the waiter was very slow and didn't bring the basics, like silverware, without being asked. The food was really underwhelming and my fries were straight up cold. When we asked for our checks it took us half an hour to get them and then another 20 minutes for the waiter to bring our cards back. At this point I realize that I hadn't gotten the cards from the deal where if I buy a qualifying meal I get a $10 gift card (which for me, meant $40) so we wait 10 more minutes for the waiter again to come back and bring the cards and while he is gone getting my gift cards we realize one of my group also qualified for a $10 card and he didn't get his either, so we had to wait for him again. Because of coarse he only brought the ones we SPECIFICALLY asked for the first time.  Probably won't go back again, the bowling was fun when it was working, but I can bowl at other, better quality places that won't disappoint this badly. Will probably give my gift cards to someone who has more patience than I do.",

    "text": "So .... I planned a Friday night out with my Meetup group Space is the Place. Our party consisted of about 14-16 people. About 1 weeks ago I called Main Event to try to reserve  space and check on recent promotions.  The most recent promotion as advertised on the website was \"Unlimited play for $5\" until Saturday, November 5th.  I mentioned this on the phone when I spoke with (Angela).  She informed they were no longer honoring that deal HOWEVER, if we come in together and mention it they'll honor it.  We arrive there (about 5 of us at once) and guess what ... the promotion was over weeks ago and they would honored it.  I explained I spoke with someone about a week ago and explained the whole story and nope .. nothing!  So we were offered a 3 hour unlimited play deal for $34.99 or the arcade card 3 hour unlimited play for $12.95.  We opted for a round of bowling ($36 an hour up to 7 people + $.95 for the shoes) and a round of laser tag (forgot the price).  We were told it would be a 25 min wait for us to get 2 lanes next to each other.  No problem!  We all went back to the eating area with a buzzer for more drinks and dinner.  Before we ordered dinner, our server reminded us of which dinner items comes with a free fun card.  She also says ..\"also .. right now we're doing a promotion for $5 unlimited play .. any game ).  We look at each other like O_O .. the hell?  She noticed the faces, excused herself and went to the front register to confirm what she just told us.  The verdict:  The promotion was over!  No problem at this point .. we already paid .. we just questioned the truth at this point.  Dinner:  Pretty darn good!  I ordered the grilled salmon with a side salad instead of the almond rice.  I'm not a huge rice person.  The salmon was grilled perfectly, a little salty and served with grilled artichokes and tomatoes on the side.  The salad was a spring mix, it came out room temperature/ a little on the warm side, so the greens were wilted a little.  Someone else in our party order a bacon cheeseburger ... regular  ... nothing special.  Someone else order the chicken pasta (I can't remember the name).  Pretty tasty!  One person ordered the friend fish and chips .. it's cod.  Cod is delicious but it was a little salty, just like the salmon.  One person ordered the chicken tender basket .. regular nothing special.  Lastly, someone ordered the pretzel  ...... my Goodness that thing was huge.  Really huge and its accompanied with stone mustard, and hot cheese. It's so good!  Must be a sharable item!  After eating and going for another round we realized that we were waiting a really long time for our lanes.  We got our buzzer at 9:05, at 9:50 I went to check on our wait time.  BINGO!! 2 lanes were available immediately so there we went.  From there .. everything else was a GO!  We had 7 people on a lane, everyone kept walking off to get drinks and more snacks (Note: we literally only saw the waitress one time.  Once!  She never came back). We ran out of time with 2 more rounds left, we asked if we could just finish the last 2 and the young lady at the front with glasses and brown and blonde hair was kind enough to give us 15 more mins to finish.    We'd definitely come back and give them another shot.  Especially because with most of the food items you get a $10 gift card. Oh .. speaking of which .... I ordered 2 entrees, closed my tab at the bar area and moved to the lanes and totally forgot to retrieve my free fun cards.  I wasn't until I got in my car to leave and my friend said \"Well ... we at least have to come back again to use our free fun cards\".  I yelled, \"Crap .. I forgot mine\".  I went back in and showed the manager my recipe for the salmon and chicken pasta and he came back with 2 fun gift cards for $10 each.  So .. We'll definitely be back and I'll update my review.",

We were sent to laser tag at the wrong time and the man attending the ropes course didn't even notice a girl crying and holding onto one of the poles for ten minutes because she was scared. My daughter was overcharged for one child and didn't notice until after she had paid the bill. All of the kids were supposed to get $20 on a game card, but the cards only had $5 on them so we had to collect all the cards and the manager had to fix them for us. The only reason I gave this place three stars is because the kids had fun and that is ultimately what mattered.",

So we look up prices and are blown away at how reasonable the \"fun pass\" they offer actually is. $10 gets you most of the big attractions including the gravity gym, bowling and laser tag. Since my little sister has never played laser tag that's where we went first. First thing I noticed is the smell of urine throughout the laser tag arena.  Second thing I noticed is that most all of the employees hate their jobs. Third thing is that there are no rules  followed.  Now I'm a grown man and have expectations for business establishments. This whole let's just give kids guns and not supervise, doesn't fly with me at all.   On a side note, the ladies at the front payment desk where very nice, knowledgable and their customer service was on point. Your shuffle board table was fun and your arcade games were modern and accurately priced.   Notes to management: -Demote the guy running the laser tag today too a dishwasher, not only was he on something, he also was clearly not interested in doing his job since he spent his time on his phone playing Pokemon (don't underestimate a grown mans eyes).  -clean your laser tag arena more thoroughly and depict the rules in a more efficient and understandable manner. -have a referee in the arena to ensure the game is being played correctly. -minimum age requirement for laser tag should be 8 years old.",

The problems were mostly solved by the only good person at this \"fine establishment\", another server by the name of Mario, who handled the situation as a REAL server should. Not to mention, when we first arrived the woman at reception failed to inform us that there was a waitlist for bowling and we had an issue with someone stealing our lane. We were already seated in the lane we were supposed to be in when the workers sent over another group of people and changed our names to theirs. It was a very displeasurable time and overall a waste of money. The only reason this place deserves even a single star is because Mario had common decency in which the other workers lacked.  There were so many problems that could have been resolved if only some of the workers had even the littlest attention to detail. Most of our time spent was occupied by aggravation and waiting since no one seemed to get anything right around here.",

    "text": "Went for the first time this last Monday when they have a $10 dollar deal so the spot was definitely poppin. Seemed like mostly jr high high school kids with a sprinkle of young college kids. Our crew was likely the only 30+ group but maybe that's just because we're kids at heart. The bowling lane is not your mom and pops old AMF lanes. Music videos playing with top 40 sports on other screens lights the whole shebang. Definitely a cosmic bowling vibe. Shoe rental was $5 and they seemed clean and I like that fact that it was an easy slip on velcro. The scoreboard where you enter your names has its own camera so you can all take different pictures then the animations after each person bowls uses those faces. Easy entertainment but nice perk. You get bowling for an hour then have to sign up again for a second slot. About 20 lanes but they weren't allowing them all to be filled at the same time. Not sure why. Food menu was regular bar food options but slightly better. I think I had baja tacos. Beers liquor were fair priced ($5-7 20 oz) Staff was attentive. We also did laser tag and it felt like about 40 people at a time. You sign for the groups in advance so its not a herd of people trying to get in line at once. The equipment in there seemed pretty basic easy to use not too bulky. The kids knew where to hide but even one of the older guys in our group ended up being top 5 scorer.    As you walk in they have they  pool on one side and traditional arcade game setup on the other side. The place also has a small restaurant bar area so if the kids are off playng and you want to just relax watch sports etc there is a place for that too.",

    "text": "Came here one night for a work-related event and had a good time. This was the second time my workplace had an event here that I know of so it looks like it's good for that type of thing. It was a meet and mingle type of deal so I mostly met folks from our vendor and made LinkedIn contacts and did all that cheesy networking stuff. Our vendor's corporate culture centers around alcohol to a crazy level and we were all handed drink tickets like they grew on trees or something - it probably also helped that everybody who was expected to didn't show up due to other engagements so there was lots of extras. The food consisted of tacos, sliders, and boneless chicken wings. Also chips with some type of spinach dip. From looking at the menu on the website I take it our marketing folks opted for the Casual Get Together menu option. The tacos were the best item IMO. Everything else was just ok. I wasn't footing the bill so I didn't really care and the more drink tickets I cashed in even less so. Ended up keeping my gaming cards for another time since the mingling and drinking was the main point and the games were a distant second. Place is huge but it wasn't too crowded that night. Will probably come back again. If you like FlipSide or Dave & Buster's - you'll probably like this place. It's on that same road that keeps curving and passes by Total Wine as well as IKEA. Lots of parking since it has its own lot.",

It wasn't busy and our table was dirty.    The waitress did not offer any happy hour specials. We had to ask.   Once we placed our orders,  she literally brought one item to the table at one time.   We had to flag her down for drinks.   There were six of us and she brought only 3 plates and 2 sets of silverware.  The food was good but drinks were way over priced. I will not go back for happy hour but I will return to enjoy bowling and games.",

    "text": "We came here with family for my son's birthday. We got the $5 fun pass for everyone, but it was pretty annoying that we waited 2.5 hours to bowl to begin with, and then didn't even make it through one game before the bowling lane shut off and we had to get back on a list. By the time we could bowl again, most of our party had left. However, I understand it was busy and everyone needed a chance to bowl, so I wasn't too upset about that, though everyone else was. What was more upsetting was the customer service. The first time we bowled, no server came to our lane. We had like 8 people wanting to order food and drinks, and even though we asked for a server, no one ever came so we had to go to the bar for service. The second time we bowled, a server came by immediately, brought us one drink, and then disappeared for the whole hour, even though we had said we wanted to order more in a minute. We didn't see her again at all until we were done and needed to pay. I gave up on the idea of ordering dinner there, as did most of our group, so we just got food somewhere else afterward. It's like they didn't even want our money! We won't be back for any parties or group events. I gave two stars only because we still had some fun in spite of the awful food service. The only helpful person we encountered was the girl giving out the bowling shoes at the counter. It's too bad we couldn't order drinks from her!",

Overall a horrible experience for an overpriced indoor castles and coasters themed building . We won't be returning, I only gave a 1 star because a no star isn't an option",

We tried to take the kids there on Saturday evening but it was so packed that we didn't think the unlimited laser tag, bowling, billboards and gravity ropes would be worth it. We came on Sunday afternoon instead. It was a good move as it wasn't too crowded. The deal was $15.95/person from 12-4 pm. We got there at 1 and went straight into a 15 minute game of laser tag. When it was over we went to sign up for another round. Since it wasn't super busy the girl at the counter signed us up for three straight rounds. It was really cool as we didn't even have to take off the gear for 45 minutes. All in all, we played 5 rounds of laser tag and a bunch of video games. The kids had a blast. Tons of fun. Didn't bowl or anything else this trip because the laser tag is what the kids wanted to do. However, when we arrived it looked like there were plenty of lanes available. It was definitely more crowded as you got closer to 4pm. Will be back.",

However,  when we went to pay they said the card cannot be used for food and beverages (even though the card specifically says this). This is not the first time we have had a negative experience.

    "text": "My nieces had been wanting to try this place and after seeing the April/May deal, we decided to go last night about 6:30 pm. It was buzzing with kids, teenagers and families which was exactly what was expected. There was a long line to get to the counter where she was very nice but you can only get a wristband from her. So, in order to bowl, do laser tag or play on the gravity ropes, you have to go across the whole place to get signed up on a list. We were quoted an hour to bowl, laser tag was quoted at 8:45 and the ropes were booked til 10. Great...now what? So, we asked the girl working the winners circle, which is where you go sign up for everything else, how the arcade games work. Alexa told us that for 9.95, we could have unlimited games. We were like...oh neat! So, we went back up and the young man up there said that it was 9.95 for 20$. Totally makes more sense but when she originally gave us our card, it had 40$ on it. Confusing as he'll. They should tell you how long the waits are when you buy your wristband. I had enough money to keep us entertained but if they were there on their own, their allowance would have run out in the 1st 30 min. Every game was at least a dollar to play. Ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I spoke to a manager and said we were quoted an hour to bowl, it's been an hour and a half. Can we just have our money back and lo and behold!! Our name was called <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnext.By&s=4b6ca94a0346e6a288298e5b95fac6c73903d6b1d9c4bf2f5d942283a5db4769\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">next.By</a> now , it was 8:15-8:30   and we bowled 1 game and left. Its a very confusing system, and I think the management should have someone who knows what they're going at the winners circle which is the only register that needs constant attention and multi tasking skills. Nobody looked happy to work there. Also, my niece loves those claw machines and on the bling king one where you could win a watch or bracelet etc...was a total piece of junk. The claw didn't even close, not even a little bit. The other one, wouldn't close all the way. Crappy equipment, under trained staff, long wait times and managers who don't see any of this.....bad business.",

Then, upon payment, he gave us someone else's credit card. We informed him of this, but it made us wary to give our own payment in credit lest he make the same mistake and someone used our card to charge their order. After we reordered an additional time he brought us our food and requested payment. We paid in cash and gave him $25 for a $19 meal. He never gave us change, so we requested the change. After waiting another 20+ minutes for him to continuously \"forget\" our change he claimed he didn't have $1 bills to give us. So he gave us a $5 bill. This was obviously so we couldn't give him anything but a $5 tip. It was so weird I feel like we were being conned or something... We ended up just giving him back the $5... Really bizarre  Also we ordered an alcoholic drink and he didn't ask for our ID. The people bowling beside us looked underage and were also indulging in alcoholic drinks...",

We arrived on a Monday afternoon at 3  for drinks and food, after having one or 2 drinks we played laser tag and then decided to bowl. The bowling alley was super nice and we were able to order drinks from a waitress. That's when a party came to a horrible end! After a gal in our party tried to order a Third drink (3 in 31/2 hours) our waitress told us that she was \"slowing her down on her drinking\" we ordered 5 drinks between 8 people! Our waitress told us that she would have to kick us out if we ordered another drink!! WHAT!!? My co worker was so insulted that this women was talking to her this way. The waitress when confronted by me proceeded to tell us that she was trained to look for signs of when people had too much to drink but when I asked her if she knew how drinks we had she had no idea! Then she told me that the women in question had ordered two drinks within a few minutes of each other, we told her the drinks weren't even for her! We spent close to $500 and were treated like garbage!!! Beware if you are going here for fun!! Not so much. Thanks for stealing $500 welcome to the neighborhood main event!!!",

Comparing to say, Dave & Busters, it has about 30% of the games, but also has a bowling alley and billiards in addition to the food and full bar.  Sunday through Thursday they have free billiards until 7, so of course I took advantage of that with a bucket of beer.  The help was friendly, and the place is still relatively new so everything is clean (for the most part).  I don't think I would come back to pay full price for anything here, but if it's happy hour or a promotion I could swing it for sure.  It's only a couple of blocks from where I work so it's possible this will happen sooner than later.  I munched on the southwestern egg rolls and chicken quesidilla - both were ok but neither knocked my socks off.  Still, totally worth checking out if and when the price is right!",

    "text": "We had my son's 8th birthday party here, and spent 500 $ for 13 kids package for laser,  pizza, and video cared  and two adult trays of food, and 3 extra game cards for little kids. You would think that for that much money, we would have great service, however, my husband and I were disappointed. First, it started that when we came in, our reservation was not correct, we had made changes the day before and moved the time up 30 minutes, however, this was not passed on to the staff and it took 15 minutes for it to finally get done. Then when we went to sit down at the table, we only had one table for 16 kids and adults. This was appalling, since we had confirmed that we had 16 kids total, and that we would have food for the adults as well. When the 4 pizzas were put on the table, I asked about the other two trays for the adults and they brought it out, but had NO WHERE to put them, so I asked about putting it on the table next to us , that way we could get seating, but of course that was taken. finally the host put out a folding table in the corner , squeezed in where the food was put down. We had over 14 adults with no seating, just standing, and this was not to our liking at all. For our sons' birthday parties, we always like to accommodate adults with food, drinks, and SEATS, but this was not the case this time. Very disappointing, my husband and I have had parties in all the major venues, D & B, Amazing Jake's, etc. and this was totally a disappointment, especially for the money we shelled out.    On their defense the kids liked laser tag and the arcade games were fine (too expensive though), however, we did not have ENOUGH SEATING for a party with 16 kids and their parents...  Recommendations: 1. Enlarge the party area, do not book two tables back to back, that is very uncomfortable and frankly, rude 2. Have two hosts for each part, our host had too much to do and slowed the party down 3. Have some parties in the front area where the seating was, that area was totally empty",
