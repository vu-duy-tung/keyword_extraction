The portions were generous. This is the first place I have ever eaten where I actually liked the rice. It was light and fluffy.  It is worth the trip.",

Nino is mad cool and he plays sports on television during the evenings often, if that's what you're into. The staff is friendly and I enjoyed coming here. Highly recommend if you want something that's more relaxed and chill.",

If I'm paying $8-10 for a salad, I expect some substance and not just a pile of iceberg lettuce with a lame chicken breast. Nino's has deliciously flavored meat (both gyro and chicken) that tops a huge pile of fresh romaine and complimentary vegetables.  Included is the Tzatziki sauce for the free pita and a side of Greek dressing that surpasses any I've had in the valley.  The portions are enormous and the service is quite good.  From the outside, Nino's doesn't look like a 4-star establishment, but my tastebuds and pocketbook think it's the best!",

The falafel is delicious both on its own, the falafel pita is the bomb, I always add hummus to my falafel pitas to make sure it's not too dry for my taste but theirs doesn't need it. The falafel is flavorful and moist already.   The gyro is absolutely the bomb. It's surprising how many places can really f-up a gyro, and refreshing to get exactly what you want when you get the craving for a good ass gyro.   Their lamb souvlaki is good as well. They have good portions of everything. I really like their Greek salad dressing. The fries are always hot and crisp. The rice is okay.   Hands down this is the best Greek I've had in the Valley, I've tried 4 or 5 spots. A plus is how friendly they are, and the care they take when prepping/serving the meal.",

Had the falafel pita the first time and just completed the arduous task of finishing off the lamb souvlaki platter (serving size was huge). Both were tremendous, but the lamb was INSANE. Tender, juicy, flavorful, perfect. You can tell they highly value their customers as well - the cashier remembered me and welcomed me back. Amazing dining experience for a local neighborhood joint. 5 stars well deserved!! They get bonus points too because the local firefighters came in while I was there, so that added a little something different ;)",

The staff has always been polite and helpful, not to mention that the interior is clean and well kept. As for the food, it is all great! The spanikopita is smooth and flaky with a rich flavorful taste! I especially enjoy their standard gyro, which has always been one of my favorites. The meat is always cooked just right with the pita bread being soft and fluffy, and onions, lettuce and tomato seems to be fresh cut. That is a nice touch because a lot of places don't go through that trouble. Their chicken and beef pitas are great too, but my real love is still the standard gyro! I have tried the greek fries, and they are tasty, but a little heavy. The have this garlic sauce that I don't know what they include it with as a standard, but it is fantastic! Great on fries, or pretty much anything! I also like to dip fries in their Tzatziki sauce because theirs always seems fresh and smooth! This is a great little place if you are craving some great gyros at a great price served by a friendly staff!",

    "text": "First of all... Ninos by far deserves these 5 stars! This place is the epitome of why I LOVE local, hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Before I get into the delicious food, their service is exceptional. From order to walking out, these business owners know how to treat their customers.   A friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area, along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time, so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro, lamb, chicken breast, falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread, salad, rice, AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes, I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh.   Here's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate, or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming, they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents, they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation, gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say, our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces, additional pita bread, and drinks. And most importantly, one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!",

The chicken on it was very disappointing. It is seasoned with something that resembles cinnamon. I don't usually like cinnamon on my chicken, I may be the only one. This chicken is seasoned so much that it made the chicken look like chicken thighs and I'm pretty sure it's chicken breast. The seasoning is so rich they should make it known to customers.   2 stars because it was a to go order and service was great. It was fast and the girl was very pleasant.

    "text": "Nino's is in a nondescript location but serves up some really tasty food. I had a half Gyro half chicken shawarma plate which came with rice, pita, fries, and salad. The salad was fantastic, it looked very simple but was fresh and flavorful beyond its appearance. My favorite thing on the plate was probably the pita. Each piece was nestled underneath the meat portion and absorbed those juices without getting soggy. The surface of the pita was slightly crispy and seasoned with the same mix as was present on the fries, which put it over the top. Staff was friendly and had no problem fixing me up a half/half plate even though it wasn't on the menu. The food was piled on the plate and packed pretty tightly - I was impressed with how much food there was. I'm happy to add this to my rotation of lunch options during the week and I'm looking forward to trying all the other great looking menu items.",

It's a mom and pop style shop and there's seating inside as well as patio seating. Very casual.  The food is amazing and their gyro meat is delicious. I was on a Greek salad (with gyro meat) kick for a while so I was trying a bunch of places in the area. This is definitely the winner! The salad comes with a creamy dressing, but they have a vinegarette style substitute which is a more traditional style and is excellent. This doesn't pertain to me but in case it's helpful to others - it doesn't seem very handicap accessible. There isn't much of a walkway so you park in the dirt parking lot or on the side street, and there are just a few steps you have to take to step up to the building. If this isn't an issue - definitely try this place!",

Coming from the East ( I know hate me), and a large Greek community, I am use to a Greek salad the likes I have had everywhere except here.  All I wanted was a Greek salad.  I saw the new sign and was delighted then I saw the salad and I almost cried.  Some sort of Greek/Ranch dressing, some sort of cheese product.  I like my Greek salad with olive oil, vinegar (white), lemon and real feta, olives, real tomatoes, and option of anchovies.  Am I crazy?  Is my expectation unrealistic that a Greek salad would be universal?  I would gladly go back if they serve the real salad and not some I don't know what it is.  Please, please make the salad as good as the meat products then I can have a truly great dive dining experience.  PS: the salad we had was not the same salad featured in the posted photos.  Are the other reviews real?  Or is there special salad for special customers?",

My falafels were so dang dry, combined with a stale pita, it was almost impossible to eat without a huge glob of tzatziki on each bite. Literally was hard to swallow it was so dry. & my fries were fried in old oil that wasn't warmed up enough so they were heavily saturated gross oil while being limp & floppy. I was only able to consume about 1/3 of my food before I threw it away. & there was an infestation of biting gnats that kept flying around in our faces while we were eating.

The tzatziki sauce has a unique flavor, unlike any other tzatziki sauce I've had anywhere else. The same with the Greek dressing for the salad (they call in something else in fact).  I couldn't believe how stuffed the pita was ... I was so happy about that!  The falafel is also out of this world good.  I only ordered one because I'm skeptical of falafels in AZ.  Some places don't grind the chickpeas up enough for me.  Some places' falafels taste like they came out of the frozen food aisle in a grocery store.  Here at Nino's they're perfect!   The atmosphere is super casual, definitely a neighborhood place. When I pulled up during my last visit and my GPS said you've arrived, I almost thought this was someone's house.  I didn't care, the yelp reviews said try it.  I hope my review influences you as well.  I dined in - well outside on the patio.  When I first arrived there was only one couple eating outside.  By the time I finished my meal there was a small line on the inside (about 5 people in line) and 3 new couples dining outside.  Clearly, place is a favorite amongst many. I'll most certainly return again and again    Oh ... There's free wifi",

It's a basic counter-order set up with slightly limited seating options (unless it's winter, in which case the patio looks nice). The food is basic Greek place- for instance, I had a salad that was just lettuce with some veggies and gets stuck in there. It was all fresh, though, and for what you pay, the portions are OLYMPIAN in size. Check their daily special when you go in, or just order the cheese fries, they're always good.",

I have not tried enough of the menu yet to give it a five star, but I am looking forward to it.  The gyro platter is big and tasty, there is so much meat.  This is the issue I had with an unnamed greek restaurant on 7th Avenue where I received three or four strips of gyro meat on a pita.  Ninos does not skimp on the meat.  The salad was pretty big too, and the tomatoes were red and juicy, not that anemic orange whitish hard kind of tomato that has become the American standard. Ninos seems to consistently be doing a pretty brisk business in the evenings when I walk by with my dogs, and that alone says more than my one review.   I recognized the cook at Ninos, he had worked at another very good greek restaurant I often frequented over the years, so I know this place will be a hit.",

It was really, really well prepared. The french fries that came with the first time were super good, not so much the second time around, but I went at the end of the night, they were busy, and maybe needed to change the oil but didn't have a chance.  Another thing I have to point out: the people who work there are super nice and helpful.  The level of customer service from both times I was there was top-notch, and I think they should be acknowledged for that.  The building itself... honestly leaves a little to be desired, but you know what, I came for food, and they do a great job of that.  I can't dock a star for that.",

I left unimpressed.  I ordered a gyro combo, with greek salad and drink.  The price was very reasonable, at $7.95.. I asked for both without tomatoes. When they brought the tray to my table a few minutes later, I immediately noticed tomatoes in the salad. The girl apologized and had them make me a new salad.  The gyro was on a \"standard\", grocery store quality 6 inch pita. The meat, while a generous portion, was the generic, processed gyro meat. There was a very small amount of tzatziki  sauce on it, so the gyro was dry.. The salad was again a nice portion, but the cheese sprinkled on top did not taste like feta.. Maybe just a very bland goat cheese. None of the flavor that a good feta provides. And my biggest complaint on the salad was the dressing. I have had many a Greek Salad in my day, and they always come with an oil and vinegar based dressing, with oregano, lemon juice, etc.. This salad had what tasted like Ranch as the dressing.   I try to frequent small, mom and pop owned businesses when i can. But I won't pay my hard earned money for something that doesn't live up to my expectations..   If you want some good, inexpensive Greek food, try Greka Pita at Camelback Colonade instead..",

You get a lot of food!  It should be enough for most people to take half of it home for another meal.  I had the gyro platter.  The meat might not have been as seasoned as I would expect.  However, the beauty of going to a new restaurant, you don't know where the region of Greece that their menu comes from and the flavor  of the food will change accordingly..  Other wise it really was a great meal with the accompanying food and flavors being all I could ask for.  It did come with french fries which surprised me but were nicely flavored as well.  It was a nice meal and I will go back to try something else on the menu.  This is a little place that you might miss so do look for it.  Also, I got the impression that they do a lot of take out.  So if you don't see a lot of cars in the parking lot, don't be alarmed.  I watched quite a few people doing pick up orders.",

It was a hefty sandwich with lots of falafel and greens  The falafel was definitely on the dry side. If u plan to order falafel tell them not to over fry.   Very nice people run this place.",

Unfortunately this is not longer an option. The pita, rice, fries, and salad are a welcome addition.  The burger, although what seems to be a frozen patty, is very meaty and fulfilling with layers of gyro, cheese, tomatoes, and onion.  They serve coke products and unsweetened tea as well as glass bottle option in the fridge.  There is seating inside and outside on the patio deck. They do have a parking lot up front but you may need to find street parking.",

I asked for a manager and explained I was just placed on hold for over 15 minutes and then hung up on instead of my order being placed. She said rudely \"we are too busy\" and hung up!! I called back and asked if she was going to keep hanging up or get a manager like I asked. She nastily said here YOU talk to her and gave the phone to another lady. 2nd lady refused to get a manager & said they are too busy if I want to order come in. I order salads from here WEEKLY and gave plenty referrals starting today I will NEVER again. Completely wasted my lunch time. I let everyone I know, know about their POOR customer service.",

We've had the chicken, the lamb, the salads, the pita, the gyro, the rice everything was fresh & made to order. Everything was truly delicious & great value.   Even better than the most popular food cart in downtown Athens as recommended by Globe Trekker.  What a treat. The place is clean, the owner is attentive & they have either fountain drinks or by the bottle ....nice touch. The food is created from the recipes of the owners family & boy can you tast the love & care in this food.   Have to go because they are opening soon!",

It smelled so good so I decided to go back and order some food to go for my boyfriend and I. We loved it! The hummus was tasty!! I love hummus, and I'm very picky about it however, Nino's was yum! I also ordered a pita club sandwich to share and it was so unique! It was very good! Hit the spot..most definitely comfort food. Greek food is one of my boyfriend and my favorite foods! We love pita! I also love that the owner is greek and he was the one cooking. You can tell he puts his love into his food!",

Nevertheless I was greeted by their friendly order-taker and told her I wanted their chicken platter. What I got was exquisite. The chicken was well seasoned and grilled just right. Their sauce, which looks like a cross between ranch and blue cheese, has a subtle yet satisfying flavor. Overall I loved the dish and will have to explore more Greek cuisine. Be careful how much you order because you won't be able to stop.",

The first time I went I thought maybe it was because they just opened and needed to get their service groove on.  the second time I went again it took about 30 minutes to get my take out order.  It was later in the day and no other customers were ahead of me.  I feel like that location is just cursed to not be successful.  It has been 3 or 4 different places in the last few years.  It is a shame that it takes so long to get your food from them because the location is close to my apartment and I love me some Greek food.  If the owner or employees reply and let me know they have improved their speed I would give them another chance.  Otherwise I will keep looking for good Greek food in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Had take-out lunch here for the first time. Ordered the Gyro Platter, which costs $11. Barely worth $6 to be honest.... The platter comes with meat, lemon rice, and seasoned fries. The rice was pretty plentiful, about 2 scoops, but it was incredibly bland and cold; ate it because I was hungry but could have just as easily left it, it was forgettable. The fries were cold, limp, and soggy, and did not come with any condiments.  The gyro is your typical mass-produced processed minced meat, not actual authentic lamb and beef gyro steaks. That is always disappointing!  Surprisingly the platter did not come with anything else and I had to order a side of pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The pita bread was decent, but definitely mass-produced and sold to Nino's, not fresh or homemade. The sauce was also decent, but was way too heavy on the dill which overpowered everything.  So that is what you get for $11 - processed minced & pressed meat, cold soggy fries, cold flavourless rice.  I won't say this lunch was bad, but it was not good either. I've had worse, but I expected much better based on the top-heavy reviews here.  The reason I tried Nino's is because we stopped going to Greka Pita since the bizarre changed in ownership, and I don't really see myself going back again. Very unimpressive  - generic, bland, and expensive for what you get.  ...I'm still looking for good authentic Greek in the valley. Where is it?",

It doesn't look like much but it's something very special.      Up front I'll say that it's hard to find good Lamb at any Greek place in the valley. I've had it at every Greek place I've gone to and it's always tough, over cooked and rarely edible.      I choose the Lamb Gyro. Real chunks of Lamb, properly marinated for 24 hours, cooked on a kebob and then placed in the Pita with all the fixings.      To say the least it was wonderful. Tender, tasty and very satisfying. I also had the Fries which were stunning. Crisp and delicious. Most fries in this country are never made right. These were. I couldn't have been happier.       Some very nice Baklava came home with me and lasted all of 5 minutes once I started eating it.      You can't go wrong here. They seem to do everything right when it comes to Greek food. I will be back and willing to drive the 17 miles, since the food is so much better than most of the Greek places near me, but one.",

If they sold loukamades for dessert, I would be in heaven. Sadly, thats one thing that's missing. But as it sits now, it's a great, fast, reasonably priced, local spot for Greek food.",

But the gyro cheeseburger is fantastic! Especially with a Greek side salad. Excellent service -- place your order at the counter and they bring it to you, then they check back to make sure all is ok. As i said, i love this place!",

The Greek salads are great and the smaller size is definitely enough food. Here's a tip for you - I would recommend asking for the salad dressing on the side. They tend to drench it in dressing, but if you apply it based on your own preferences it will be terrific. You can even ask for a couple of pieces of falafel on top of your salad and they will happily do so. The falafel is delicious!!!!  Make sure to give them a try if you like Mediterranean food! 4 stars!",

Then she got our order wrong. Missed a whole sandwich after our order was repeated to us 3 times! In regards to the food, all the food is pre made and bland BS!  The rice was bland and the salad was literally lettuce and dressing. I wouldn't mind if they had cheaper prices, but one platter and a sandwich was $30. Be ready to bus your own tables as well here. Side note: We just had Pita Jungle and it is a thousand times better and cheaper! Overall, Nino's is Highly not recommended. They should be embarrassed.",

    "text": "Let me sum things up in one sentence, and this is me talking.. I made one salad from Ninos two meals. I took half of it home.  Ho...ly...gyro.   I was craving some Med food badly yesterday, and, low and behold, I jumped on the Yelp app. I found Ninos after passing by several other joints. I didn't realize that this was at the same location as the failed burger joint from a few months back until I rolled up. But, after a brief hesitation, I figured, eff it. I'm super happy I did because it's reasonably-priced Mediterranean food with flavor and generous portions to boot! Seriously, a large Greek salad is enough for two people with big appetites. I've gone to so many places with \"bleh\" Greek salads that are generally just skimpy. Who wants to pay $10 for a shallow bed of iceberg, half a portion of gyro meat, and three piece of red onion? Not me, that's who! I got a mountain of salad, and I'll probably order the regular size from now on unless I want to take half home.  So go. Show your support to the super chill staff, and help build this place's rep up a bit. I'm already looking forward to going back when I get my cravings. Great portions and solid flavor alone would have been enough, but the people there were great as well. Go.",

Nino himself actually personally took care of us.  We ordered Spanikopita and Cheese Fries as an appetizer which were both delicious.  The Cheese Fries had two cheeses, one of which was freshly ground feta.  So good!  Next we had Gyro sandwiches with a huge side salad, all of which was delicious.  Being a lover of gyros, I must admit that the meat was extra tender and flavorful.  Lastly, Nino brought us out very tasty baklava.  I will be back to Nino's in the future.  It was a great experience today and I am glad I found the joint.",
