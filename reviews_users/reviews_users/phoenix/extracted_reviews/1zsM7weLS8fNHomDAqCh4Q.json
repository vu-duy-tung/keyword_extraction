There were puddles of grease on the pan. They tried to remedy the situation by adding more greasy fries on top. Our second waitress was really nice so this review is mostly based on the food.",

Sat down two hours before spring training game and let our waiter know but that didn't help either. Service was slow for drinks and food. I ordered a lettuce wrapped burger and it came out with one soggy piece of romaine some tomato slices and the patty. That's it, no toppings no cheese. We were in such a hurry that we could send it back. When the manager came out (Thompson) he just had excuses and only gave 20% off the bill to try and help but by that point it didn't make up for the shitty service and shitty food and us being late to the game. Would never come here again.",

If you're hungover the next day and believe only halfly in the \"hair of the dog\" mentality, you can buy an individual mimosa for $5. There is never anyone there, so the wait staff is always super friendly, attentive, and makes sure we are full of mimosa!  Their brunch is pretty stinking good. Their chicken and waffles plate isn't Lolo's style, but it's still pretty tasty. Their eggs Benedict always hits the spot, and their $5 (maybe $6) biscuit and gravy \"side\" is actually a monstrous plate of 4 biscuits, and their biscuits are not bad at all.  This place really is a gem on Mill. I don't know what would make it 5-stars, something to separate it from other brunches? Maybe a mimosa or Bloody Mary bar? When it's nice enough I look forward to playing bags on the outside patio.",

    "text": "Lots of micro brews but no flights.... Huh  Great menu with lots of options including quite a few vegetarian dishes (great since my wife and I are veg). We went to place our order only to discover since its the weekend they only serve a small portion of their menu on weekends and have no vegetarian options. What??   So we messed around with the brunch menu and found an apple fritter sandwich with egg,  since we were told the maple syrup had bacon in it we told them to hold that and the we would both have the fritter egg sandwich.   10 minutes later we find out that of course they have only one of those... So back to the menu. We get one of these egg things and a waffle but ask for syrup without bacon in it.  When we get our order the fritter thing looks awesome except the big chunk of ham on it and the waffle syrup after three confirmations and assurances that it is bacon free... Has bacon. Mmm dry waffle.   So this place epically sucks. They take back the fritter (I certainly don't want it now) and then come out and apologize as even though the ham isn't mentioned on the menu they randomly threw it in the dish. Maybe because we said we were vegetarian? Seriously who does that? What if I was veg for religious reasons? 2 billion people on this planet don't eat meat so how about not adding it to dishes you claim to not have meat.   This place is terrible, there are tons of options within 100 feet so skip this place at all costs.   If you have allergies or food preferences avoid this place like the plague, they don't have a clue what is in their food, they only serve a fraction of their menu on weekends and they are out of the few things they do have... But will happily throw random sh*t into your meal not listed on the menu so if you are into that kinda thing then give this place a try. But if you are a normal human being who likes food and trying new beers then this place is like getting a sharp stick to your eye.  Manager did comp us two beers on a $100 tab for all the trouble of not eating lunch and the band was great so there is that.",

So craft beer lovers, come play!! Happy hour pricing is on point too, especially if you want to eat some wings. Also, plenty of things to do here, since I hate just sitting at the bar and having a drink. There's bucket pong, beer pong (cup challenge game), ski-ball, and rockem sockem robots...which are dangerous for competitive people like me.  For atmosphere...they have a huge outdoor area with high quality patio furniture and nice lighting. Also, keep an eye out for their Trivia nights, the people running it are really friendly and ask some great questions.  Going back every week!",

When we got in we went to sit at the bar and instantly they told us that they were understaffed and apologized. Hey it happens, whatever. I still feel like I got pretty fast service at the bar and was paid attention to so that didn't affect us. I loved that they had adult capri sun and spiked hot chocolate. That really got my attention. Never been to a place that had that. I ordered a Vodka Collin and it was not good. It tasted like minute maid lemonade and barely any vodka. I wouldn't order that again. Maybe they didn't know how to make it, idk. I also ordered an appetizer which was the half & half fries (half sweet potato, half onion rings) and they were far from good. They were unsalted and the onion strings were really soggy and not crispy at all. However, I still liked the service, im gonna give em a pass because maybe they were seriously lacking staff and couldn't get things done properly so meh. Service good, food not so good.

We came into a little bit of chaos trying to find a seat, even though there were not too many people sitting for dinner service yet. I ordered a well drink because of the happy hour menu- the ratio of liquor to water was very weak. I then ordered the not-so original chopped salad- try not-so-good. The arugula was good, but there was a disproportionate amount of the other ingredients- almost like they just opened a bunch of cans of raisins and corn and put it on the plate.   The service was slow; I feel like everyone else was interested in the tables that had about 15 young girls taking shots than the people ordering dinner. Also, I don't know if it is just because I am from California but I do not appreciate people smoking a few feet away from me while I am eating my food.

We arrived about 11 or 11:30 pm to find a sign for $2.00 Dos Equis (awesome) and I was charged correctly but my friend was charged $5.00 (bummer).  We were both within the discount time frame and ordered separately.  NO BUD LIGHT!  Major strike right there.  Begrudgingly my husband had a Coors Light.  The music seemed promising but was so loud out on the patio that we could barely talk to each other - and the mix of rap music was just awful.  No variety....maybe it was all current stuff.  I love rap but did not enjoy any of it.  It was just too loud out on that patio.  No ash trays for the people in our party who smoked on the patio so they had to use their empty beer cups.  We tried to like this place but won't be back unless the music changes and is a bit softer.  My ears still hurt.    I read other reviews and maybe this place is good for food.  We didn't get to experience any of the food.  I see it is a dog friendly patio, so maybe I need to check this place out in the day.",

We were given menus, but the bartender didn't ask for our drinks for about 10 minutes. He came back and we ordered waters he delivered them and said he'd be right back. Knowing that we were waiting for a bit he offered to take care of an appetizer for us. We got the chips and guacamole. We ate all of our guacamole and my water was empty and he bartender came to us and said are you ready for your tab!? I was like we have not even got the two tacos that we ordered. He brought them out and said he would take care of 1/2 of our tab. We then again had to proceed to ask for our tab from another bartender. Finally we left at about 1:25. This was my second time visiting. The first was a few months ago and the same service happened around the same time to my husband and I. The food was good, however the bartenders always seem to be more distracted with things other than their customers.",

The misters outside were not working (its the AZ desert in the middle of the summer!) and we had to repeatedly ask for more water. The waitress seemed like she was in the wrong profession; very inattentive. A customer should never have to ask for refills every single time she comes by. A few people in the party ordered cereal and was informed it was late coming out because she couldn't find the milk?! Really? And the food was bad...just bad. I had the Eggs Benedict and it tasted sour. I am not sure if they're using sourdough bread for the English muffin or their Hollandaise sauce was rancid, but it was disgusting. The potatoes were good at least. Yay. When we ask for the check it took at least 15 minutes for us to get it. I am guessing it was the manager that came by to see how everything was and my friend's girlfriend made a comment that service was really slow. He simply replied with sorry and walked away as if he did not care a large group of people were not enjoying themselves. Wow. Next time I'm in Tempe, I think I'll pass on this place.",

The place was busy but the hostess told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes for a table, we put our names in (didn't get a pager or anything) and headed to the bar. The beer selection was good and the service was very friendly.   After about 30 minutes I went back to the hostess stand and asked how our table was coming along, and she assured me they were cleaning off a table and it would be ready soon. After ten more minutes,  I go back to the hostess and she informs us that some random group just walked in and took our table.  Apparently the manager told her that he couldn't make them leave the table.  Sooooo what the hell are reservations and putting your name in for?    After waiting a freaking hour for a table she finally comes up to me and asks \"are you guys still waiting on a table?\". Ummmmm yeah!?!?! Once sat we waited for a bit and when our waitress arrived she let us know service was going to be slow because she was stretched so thin;  great.   We put in our food asap because we were trying to make it to the concert at five to see a performer.  The pork belly popcorn was an interesting idea but I wasn't a big fan; dry and lacking ingredients I just picked the pork off the top. We also ordered the pulled pork mac and the fried chicken sandwich.  The mac tasted store bought and was covered with bacon bits. It was just okay. My husband's sandwich was pretty decent.    Needless to say, we were late to the concert.  The bartenders and beer selection were good, but the way the place is ran is a joke. After waiting an hour for a table we didn't have a manager talk to us or even apologize.  Poor customer service.",

I'm confused by the demographic they're trying to cater to. Is it the ASU crowd? Professional crowd? Laid back? Fun? Family vibe?  Positives: GREAT beer selection Really good food Bartenders are really nice Cool layout, except for the area where they allow dogs (outside) Awesome patio/deck area Service is pretty good  Negatives: Mixed drinks are a bit expensive for what you get (very small portions). Of course it's a brewery, so maybe that's why Deck/patio is awesome but they allow cigar smoking, so it's not fun trying to eat your delicious meal with smelly cigar wafting in your face The outside game area where dogs are allowed smells like dog piss  Also, the last time I went, my husband and I stopped in for a quick meal with our toddler. We ordered a bunch of food and our bill was pretty high. I noticed when we were leaving that the manager ran over to our table and checked to make sure we paid (he grabbed the leather check holder) and didn't walk out on our check. That was a bit annoying and insulting.   Overall: It's a good place to eat/drink, but I'd recommend waiting for cooler weather and enjoying their amazing front patio - back patio is smoking. Plan on ordering beer (great selection) unless you want to overpay for cocktails that are small and a bit watered down. Try the mac n cheese for a nice spin on an old recipe.",

Then i ordered my food and I waited an outrageous, unprofessional, 90 minutes before I even got my food. By the time i got my food it was cold and was not thoroughly cooked. I then asked to speak to a manager and he was utterly lost like a deer in the headlights. He refused to take ownership of his poor service team and blamed it on the UFC fight we had gone to see. After i voiced my concerns to him he said he would look into the problem. I never saw that unprofessional,lazy, poor excuse for a manager again and had our waiter give us a garbage coupon that did nothing to alleviate the unpleasant and frankly awful experience I had there. To top off the night I then waited another 35 minutes for my card to be processed. All i got were excuses and empty words from this sham of an establishment. I strongly do not recommend this restaurant because frankly they do not deserve your money. The service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life and no customer should be subjected to that. They will never get my business or anybody I know business ever again.",

But I'm also very understanding when I see that a waiter is busy, flustered, or just having a bad day. They've always been very apologetic when something is late, or if they get busy. The ambiance is great - especially outside on the weekends when there's an acoustic guitar player there during brunch. The bottomless mimosa deal is perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch, and my favorite salad of all time is the Not-So-Original-Chopped. Actually, every salad is good! Like I said, I haven't had a bad meal here and I've tried most of the menu. Their beer is actually also quite good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like beer all that much. I love the Strawberry Bottle Rocket for a nice, light spring/summer beer. If you like beer and are kind of a foodie, try this place out.",

One leg supported the entire table, leaving it rocking back and forth like the titanic post-iceberg. Fortunately this sinking ship had some survivors. I'd like to credit the empty establishment to the music they chose to play. The playlist featured songs you'd find on a \"stuff white people like\" messenger board. I decided to order the \"CURRY CAULIFLOWER NO-MAC WITH CHEESE\" -- the only thing that was gluten-free on the menu. The cheese wasn't cheesy and the cauliflower didn't benefit from the curry. 6/10 for the meal, which was redeemed only by the warm potato chips served with meal. \"Meal\" is used loosely here, as the price didn't justify the size. Maybe it was perfect size for a European.

    "text": "Overall I had a positive experience here; I'd go back, but I'm not in a hurry. The best part about Blasted Barley is the big, comfortable outdoor areas. Service was attentive on a slow Thursday evening. Food was hit and miss. A friend and I enjoyed the buffalo wings (on happy hour price); they're large and tender, with lots of sauce. Next time I'll know to ask for extra ranch. The curry cauliflower sliders are, in a word, awful. They're not sliders, I didn't detect any real curry, and they just weren't enjoyable to eat. The lettuce was dry and seemed more like the sort of thing that should be used as a garnish. Oh well. On the plus side, my friend seemed to enjoy his rather large chop salad. The beer, also, was hit and miss. The Strawberry Bottle Rocket was good; it's a cream ale, and True to the style the texture is very creamy; it's easy to drink. The subtle strawberry flavor seems natural, not forced, and is not overwhelming, as I've found with some fruit beers. This is not my style of beer at all, but I'd have it again. (I gave it a positive review on Ratebeer.) That said, I couldn't make heads or tales of the Bang Bang Black IPA; it's watery, thin, and neither hoppy like an IPA nor malty (or roasted) like the \"black\" would suggest. There was nothing \"bang bang\" about it. And it comes in a smaller glass (probably because of the slightly higher ABV). Oh well. They do have an impressive list of beers and appear to have a full bar, so there are plenty of options. Happy hour seems to have good pricing (from 3-7).",

It looks really sharp and has a fun atmosphere. We only came for a few beers and did not eat, so I have no review on the food. We enjoyed our beer-I tried the strawberry beer that they brew there, and it was delicious. Also, they had fireball on tap, which was a nice touch. The only (and big) complaint that we had was the service. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very rude. It wasn't that she was too busy or made some sort of error, but she was just completely unfriendly. We asked her about the other beers that were to come in the future from the brewery, and she completely blew off our question. Even if she did not want to make small talk with us, I believe that she was doing her employer a disservice by not even attempting to bring back repeat business.",

It's almost like they are trying to cater to foodies who like to try new things, which could be a hit or a miss. Much of the items  include pork, which is not great if you're not a pork fan. The food selection could definitely be bigger. The server we had was sort of rude, but the bartender who handed us our drinks was very friendly and professional.  I think overall there are better places to stop by on Mill.",

I have tried their chicken and waffles and the resurrection for brunch and the resurrection might be one of my favorite dishes ever. For happy hour I tried their popcorn which lacked some seasoning, but the pork belly was delicious. The happy hour drink menu is lacking and only consists of a few beers nothing really additional. Honestly the 5 star rating mainly pertains to brunch since everything is delicious! Definitely a top stop for Sunday funday.",

There are lots of interesting little details everywhere, from the mural of the old Mill, to the ice cold keg room right above the bar! The brewery equipment is really cool and out in plain sight. The menu is unique yet familiar, with a good deal of it made in house. Many of the ingredients in the specialty cocktails are also made in house. And the beers..O THE BEERS!!! A fantastic selection from lights to stouts. The Orange Bomb is an orange chocolate stout that's very appealing, it's not too thick and has more of a citrus bite and a subtle chocolate tone that makes it very drinkable, unlike most stouts that are heavy and leave me feeling sleepy! All in all, the atmosphere, delicious food, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and upscale beer and cocktail list make this the best place to be on mill!! Love it.",

First of all, our waiter attempted to memorize our orders and then came back two times because he couldn't remember everything. Our friend is allergic to egg yolk and he told her they would not accommodate her by doing egg whites. She said okay well the only other option on this menu is the chicken and waffles unless you let me order something off the lunch menu. He said oh we're out of that...she spoke to the manager and he said they had chicken and waffles so he doesn't know why the waiter said that. The waiter also didn't put our other friend's order in...and kept saying it was \"coming\". Also, the chilaquiles are literally just nachos and cheese with an egg-don't get! Chicken and waffles were amazing after all the hassle. We also went there specifically for the bottomless mimosas-apparently they wouldn't do the deal because of Pat's Run and the UFC fight.....there was barely anyone there!

Anyway, we went in to the bar and it was obvious that they were having a serious problem. Very hectic, unorganized atmosphere. Dirty dishes and glasses piled on the bar. The \"clean\" glasses they were using for service were not clean. Gross. Place was dirty, loud and chaotic. I went down the street and got a smoothie while my party had beers, I just couldn't stand the atmosphere, dirt, and noise. I don't like judging too harshly when a business is having an obvious problem but it was pretty bad and had completely gotten out of their control, so it was a real bummer.",

My two friends and I were extremely hungry, got seated right away on the patio (which didn't have an umbrella so it was too hot) but then waited at least 10 minutes before our server Tom even greeted us. Prior to that we had to ask 3 different servers for a water bowl for my dog, but they had no problem coming up to pet him for minutes at a time. When we finally ordered, we waited again at least 30 minutes for our food.....some avo toast, the basic breakfast, and juevos rancheros......BLAND BLAND BLAND. we tried to at least give it all some flavor with hot sauce but it only made it worse. after being over it and wanting to just get out of there, we waited EVEN LONGER to ask for our checks and finally get out of there. all 3 of us work in food service, so we were only understanding up to a certain point. but this was by far a terrible overall experience. from the seating, to the service, to the bland food....",

The place has a great patio and they did some redesign so there is more seating both outside and in the front portion of the inside.   The menu feeds into my new obsession with chopped salads - they have 3 different kinds:  Smoked Cobb Chop  - house smoked turkey, roasted corn, chopped red pepper, bacon, avocado and blue-brie cheese on romaine with ranch and a fried egg  The Not-So-Original Chop - arugula, cous cous, marinated roma tomatoes, crunchy corn, currants and papitas. comes with choice of house smoked turkey or chopped avocado with creamy basil dressing.  Quinoa Chop  - arugula, quinoa, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, papitas, currants, and parmesan cheese tossed with truffle oil dressing  I went with the Not-So-Original and was impressed with the portion to price ratio. The dressing was really good, I need to recreate that recipe at home.  I sat outside on the patio and sipped the wonderful iced tea and enjoyed our gorgeous February weather. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the Chops.",

There were misters so even though it was a little warm out, the patio was still comfortable.  We all ordered drinks and food. The drinks came out pretty quickly but the food took forever! Especially considering there were not many people there at all. When it finally came out, my one friend did not get her salad and didn't get it until the rest of us were almost done. How long does it take to make a salad?   That being said, I did really like my food. I got the superhuman salad which had sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, beets, and farro with a turmeric coconut dressing. It was a great combo, the dressing was nice and light and the portion was just right. The brussels sprouts were a little chewy, but I would definitely order this again, I really liked it.   Final tally - food = awesome, service = could be better.",

For as often as I've been here, that's pretty much all I've tried. One time our waitress convinced a few of us to try what she referred to as \"vegetarian\" wings (mozzarella sticks that are covered in the \"dynamite\" wing sauce) that were very tasty. The fries here are yummy as well.   They have a good HH for beer. All of the beers they brew themselves, plus all local beers are $3 a pint until 7. The couple of beers they brew that I've tried were good (I really like the Orca, but they haven't had it in a couple months). They also do a \"lucky lady\" special ($3 for a \"surprise\" brown bag canned beer). Sometimes a few of us will try this. A lot of the time it's Keystone or Nati Ice, often times they'll have something good from San Tan brewery.   It's never been overly crowded when we come, and service can be hit or miss, but it's never terrible.",

We recently had brunch here following a pack walk around Tempe Town Lake with my pup's trainer and some other nice doggies and their people.  The folks at Blasted Barley set up one of the patios for us, and were super accommodating.  The house Bloody Mary was a steal for $5.  No, it did not come with a full meal on a stick in the drink, just lemon, lime, and olives.  But it was a little spicy and perfect.  Also had the breakfast burrito with bacon and had no complaints there, either.  Now my dog had the sweet potato waffle (among other things).  I stole a pinch and showed remarkable restraint in even letting him have it.  I kind of wished it were mine.  Don't get me wrong, he'd love the burrito, too.  I'm just happy when what he eats is actual food.  Great place for brunch!  I look forward to a return visit!",

Another in our group had the Thai Chicken Bowl complete with still-frozen chicken.

If I could I would do 10 stars.",

    "text": "So I checked this place out on a Saturday night and a Sunday afternoon.  Saturday I stumbled upon this place and I loved how many beer choices they had. There whole set up outside is amazing! Cornhole, beerpong, huge sitting area. Loved it! I tried an IPA, so good!   Sunday I came for brunch. So they have bottomless mimosas, but they charge a penny. Which I thought was weird but apparently they're aren't legally allowed to say its free refills on the mimosa pitchers. BUT a penny per refill? yeah take my pennies! Although the pitcher was a bit small for my taste but I just love alcohol. The waiter was really nice even after we asked to be moved 3 times!!! because it was raining and they don't close the back door or front door so we were getting some water to the face. STILL had a blast and giving them a 5! Way to go!  Definitely gonna go again when I'm in town!!  HOWEVER!! my only issue were the chilaquiles.... the cooks really need to some research on what chilaquiles are. I received a bunch of like nacho chips with salsa cheese and eggs just in a very small middle part. The rest of my chilaquiles were so dryyyyy. Thank god for all the mimosas.",

The cocktails were straight pours of liquor to the point where one of us had to send hers back. Food took OVER AN HOUR! since when do you want your appetizers WITH your entree?! So we ended up with a table full of food after an excessively long wait. For (very dry, unseasoned) FRIED FOODS. When another guest asked for more salad dressing, they were \"out\" of salad dressing. Who runs out of salad dressing?! I ordered a chicken sandwich, and they gave me a BURGER. Another one of our party's French fries weren't even cooked. Hard, white French fries. Nachos had no cheese, dry beans and uncooked chicken. Unreal. Then when the checks arrived, 2 people didn't get a check and another persons check was completely wrong. Do not recommend unless you're wasted on mill. Not even decent bar food.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday for lunch with my wife and neighbor. We wanted to try something new, so we came down to Mill Ave to the Blasted Barley. REALLY nice place! VERY big, probably a GREAT place for nightlife.  We sat at the bar and were handed the Beer Menu and a \"Brunch Menu\". They have a VERY nice Beer Selection covering MANY local brews as well as their OWN! We were then told that the \"limited menu\" was actually even MORE limited than it looked. We were told we could have \"Brunch\", (5 different choices) where everything included eggs. Even the Nachos had eggs on them! We were told that we could order Brunch, but NONE of the other sandwiches they had on their menu. They could do a burger, but that's it!   So, I thought I'd have a Burger! My wife ordered the Nacho like things w/eggs. My neighbor had the Eggs Benedict Special. The food came and was actually VERY good! However, IMMEDIATELY following our meal, (2 mins) my wife said she felt sick! She ran to the bathroom and ended up throwing up. Instantly feeling better afterwards and NOT being sick when she entered, nor AFTER throwing up. We came to the conclusion that ONE of the beers she had, was probably BAD! That's exactly what happens to a person when they get hold of bad beer that's sat too long in a keg, without selling.   I'd have given them a much higher score had they not had a \"limited, limited menu\". Over 50% of their limited menu wasn't even available to order. The Staff was nice and friendly. But they're restricted in what they can do. They don't make the decisions to not serve food in a restaurant. They'd also have gotten a higher score had my wife also NOT gotten sick! Not sure if we'll be back",

It was too hard to eat them as lettuce cups and I ended up getting my hands extremely sticky.   Do: try the curry sliders Don't: use your hands!   Lesson learned from Messy Morgan.   I enjoyed their beer list but the majority weren't on happy hour so I was limited. I tried their Oat IPA and it was great. I wish I had ordered the Rye IPA however, it's much better!",

Then he just didn't give a damn, and left the music playing and walked away from the booth.  Why have the game on every TV and then subject us to whatever the DJ wants to play instead of the game?  We would have stayed longer, but the DJ's actions were just too much.",

Good: the music was not intrusive, Bad: we couldn't really hear the artist sing.  Our brunch dishes were good. I had been here before and got the Mole omelet, this time I got the 'Moco Loco' it was fine but I really enjoyed the Mole omelet before. I chalk this difference up to just enjoying one of two different dishes more and not anything nefarious.   For the most part The Blasted Barley is a good time and a great place for a group meal. The menu is broad enough to appease everyone and Bottomless Mimosas at A+. Not for every weekend but good for an eclectic group, we will surely come again!",

I had the classic club with house smoked turkey breast, was really good with a side salad and balsamic vinaigrette",

    "text": "My tip about Blasted Barley is to not go here.  It was not worth it.   First, we waited about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged and asked for a drink order or even take our order.   They did not have many of the items we asked for.  We asked for garlic fries, they came back 10 minutes later and said they had no garlic fries, would tator tots be okay.  Okay fine.  We got our food and they brought onion rings.  Never asked just assumed that was okay.  I guess they burned the tator tots.  They also had no brussel sprouts which was an option for the mac n cheese side.  And apparently they had no pretzel buns which we later realized when my daughters burger was served on a regular bun not a pretzel bun as the menu says that it does.   My daughters burger arrived after we were all done eating.   And it said it came on a pretzel bun which it did not.  They never came to say, sorry for the delay.  Her boyfriend also got a burger which arrived the same time the other food arrived, so why they couldn't get my daughters burger out at the same time made no sense.  The service was incredibly slow.  It took them forever to take our order.  I asked for a lemonade and it tasted like a very weak Crystal light.   My daughter and I ordered the cauliflower mac n cheese and paid $3 extra for chicken.   It was $11 for the mac n cheese and the portion was that of a side dish and there was about 4 small pieces of chicken in there.   It was horrible.  So a total of $14 for a \"side dish\" of mac n cheese\".   I will never ever go back again.  The only \"saving grace\" to the night was they did not charge me for my daughters burger and we had a Groupon to offset the cost of the rest of the meal.   Disgusting experience from start to finish!  With all of the restaurant choices you have to go to, Blasted Barley needs to step up their game if they wish to survive!!!!!   Horrible service and horrible food.",

He also shared that they had an all-staff meeting after receiving this review (and my email) and discussed some options they have. Because he reached out to me, we stopped by there yesterday and met him. He's a solid guy with lots of industry experience and perspective. He took the time to get to know us, and shared some of his background. We'll definitely go there again, their food and drinks are too good to miss!  Original review-We went there one night last week and got great service, tonight was different. Our drinks (cocktails and beers) were served in plastic cups. Cocktail glasses were the same size as glass ones, but the beer cups were not full pints, rather maybe 12 oz. Other patrons who seemed to be friendly with the staff were being served in regular pint-glasses. When we asked the bartender she said they change to plastic at 10pm (False, from our previous visit). I tried to speak with a manager after I closed my tab, no luck, he was not around. Their porkbelly loaded fries, from our last visit were delicious.",

    "text": "We went out to Oktoberfest on Saturday night and after deciding not to wait a hour in line for tickets a couple buddies and I decided to just walk around and have a few beers before deciding to settle down somewhere and drink for the night. We heard this place had pretty decent food so we stopped in. We were are the UFC fight was on and with Oktoberfest we expected them to be Super slammed, to our surprise we walked right in, got a high top and were ready to eat some food and drink some beers. We stood at the hightop for about 10 min before someone came to ask us what we wanted to drink. By this time I had gotten a menu from the bartender and when the dude came up to welcome us, I had already decided what I wanted to eat and drink. I got wings, a buddy got a burger and we each got a beer and waters... Fast forward 30 min later... There was no sight of our waiter, there was no waters or beers on our tables, we were starving and I was super irritated. I told my buddies to lets just get the hell out of there. We joked wondering if the server even worked there or if it was just some guy that was messing with us. Long story short I have never waited more then 10 min for water, and don't like to wait very long for my beer especially when it was this slow. Mill Ave has too many bars that will be more then happy to serve you cold beer and warm food in a timely fashion. Ill be avoiding this place.",

Our waitress seemed to be familiar with the menu options and provided guidance and testers. They were having live band karaoke the night we were there. I had never done live band karaoke, but it was a blast! I like how the bar is set up, with the band on one end. That makes it easier if you want to sit and talk with friends while the band plays. I also noticed a large patio, which we did not utilize since it was blazing hot. I thought this place was really cool, and it was a great way to end a fun night in Tempe.",

Improve on interacting and making your community feel more a part of your organization dn bring thwm what they ordered.  Second trip was a Sunday morning. Excellent live reggae, slightly more attentive service, there was a light volume of patrons in the establishment, so that may have helped.  With a tuning on the wait staff, this place is going to be amazong. Excellent handles with great selections from around the U.S.   Keep up the growth guys.",

Second, my friend has a food allergy and asked for egg whites he said absolutely not \"the kitchen was too backed up\" and the restaurant wasn't even full! They told us we could only order off the brunch menu and half of the items were unavailable! We spoke to a manager and he said everything was available. Communicate with your staff!! After 2 hours, the server decided to tell us we took a table that was reserved... Hello!! Don't sit us there then! He also failed to put in multiple orders. He had the opportunity to make a lot of money off our table but def messed that up by his poor attitude. Overall I don't think I'd go back. Great patio and music. Blasted barley, pull it together!   P.s. Don't order the chilequiles , it was nachos with eggs!!",

Took quite a bit of effort to get a food order in at the bar despite there being only 2 other people at the bar. We ordered, chips and guac, pretzels, Southwest fries with pork belly and one of each taco off their Taco Tuesday menu. I would stay away from the IPA chicken, and fish tacos. But the pork belly and fried avocado tacos were amazing. The gaucamole came out 5 to ten minutes after the food did, and honestly I was hoping he would forget it because I didn't expect the portions to be so large. The guacamole wasnt worth it in my opinion, but the rest of the food was absolutely delicious.   Also, I don't know if their AC is out, but it was ridiculously hot inside, and I was sweating profusely the entire meal.  I'll likely be returning, but I really hope the service improves.",

One staff member went out of her way and brought our pup a water bowl - so sweet!   Since they have such great happy hour deals, my friends and I split the pretzel appetizer along with the honey gold wings! Everything was perfect! We all chose to get margaritas (only $12 for 2 at happy hour - decently sized as well!) We all ordered our own mac and cheese entrees. Not the biggest portion but this could be due to the fact that it wasn't that expensive (I believe it was $8 or so)! Regardless.... it was SO yummy! After the appetizers we shared it was the perfect amount of food and we couldn't have left happier (or with fuller bellies). I will be back for happy hour again here, there's no doubt in my mind!",

The GM Tyler personally came out and asked me how everything was and was attentive to all the guest in his resturant! Amazing display of workers and management!",

    "text": "I was in Tempe/Phoenix for a quick work trip and because of my schedule I wasn't able to leave the hotel for lunch. Thank goodness for Grub Hub who delivered the Thai Chicken Bowl and Blasted Popcorn in under 25 minutes (granted it was around 2:00pm, so I wasn't dealing with large crowds, I'm assuming).   Thai Chicken Bowl was super fresh. The chicken had great flavor and the dressing tied all of the flavors together.   I was nervous about the Fresh Blasted Popcorn as in a container, I thought it would become soggy. It didn't. Good flavor, but honestly, a clever idea as someone who considers herself a popcorn connoisseur.   All in all the food was delicious. To be able to and not have to order only pizza or Chinese food, but something fresh and good - I'm a fan.",

    "text": "1 star, primarily for the service  Suggested this place to meet up with some friends from out of town for brunch and was hugely disappointed. We attempted to order bottomless mimosas only for the server to tell us they are out of champagne. Not a big deal, we ordered different drinks. My friend tried to order a Moscow mule, but the server said they aren't serving those today. 30 minutes go by and the server comes back to take our food orders (but no drinks have been delivered to the table yet). As she's taking our food order she has a very noticeable bad attitude to the point where my friend asks her if she's bothered by us. Someone at our table ordered something that had a choice of toast, but the server said they're only serving potatoes today. We notice that other tables are drinking mimosas. A different server approached our table and let us know that they do have champagne and we can now order mimosas for the table. Our server finally comes to the table and we make attempt #2 at ordering mimosas. She tells us that the restaurant isn't doing bottomless today and that we can only order pitchers. So we do that. She returns back 15 minutes later (still no food or drinks at our table other than water) and tells us they no longer have champagne. We've now been here a little over 45 minutes and haven't been served our original drink order or any food. One of my friends went to the restroom and came back to tell us that the stall she went in was missing a toilet seat and that there weren't any paper towels either. After about an hour of waiting for ANYTHING (food or drink), we decide to leave. The server then brings 2 of the original drinks we ordered and tried to charge us for them. And a beer that was ordered ended up being the wrong beer entirely.  Terrible experience and don't intend to return based on the service alone.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place because of the popcorn, and I was both pleased and displeased with it. I got it to go so I could eat some later so that's not going to be a reason I rate this lower. I really like the concept of the popcorn and am a popcorn lover. Unfortunately when the popcorn came it wasn't crunchy? Like it had already gotten a little chewy from what they put on it. And it wasn't seasoned...I get that you put bacon and pork on top but if I eat the popcorn by itself it had no flavor. Regardless I still ate it because I'm a fiend with uncontrollable eating tendencies.   Overall I like the atmosphere of this place. It has a HUGE patio area with a lot of group seating kind of feel. It was pretty dead for a Friday night..not sure if that's normal. I don't know if I'll be coming back but that Pb&J burger did catch my attention. Also, the brunch menu looks awesome. Spiked cereal? Sure I'll pay $7 for you to put booze in my cereal milk, take my money!",

If I drink one, it needs to be sweet. This one was sweet and sour. My husband had a fried chicken sandwich. His reply was that it was meh. No seasoning. Just a chicken breast fried in flour. Our friend who accompanied us had the super human vegan bowl. She the quinoa was great in it! Overall great place! Not 5 stays but not bad either.",

And our whole table wasn't very impressed with the brunch menu. I am not picky and yet I had trouble finding something to eat. The food was all weird combinations, they didn't really have anything normal. A few people waited until noon but I was starving -- my boyfriend & I split a egg plate. It was good.

Because they were so busy and the kitchen is small, there were a number of items on the brunch menu that they ran out of. However, I had the best experience with a limited menu and I can't imagine how awesome it would be on a less busy day! Rob, the manager, was super chill and even brought us a round of shots! Danielle was one of the greatest and friendliest servers I have had at any restaurant. She was extremely knowledgable and her service was incredibly efficient.

The manager will come over and make it seem like he's fixing the issue but he is still charging you far more than you thought you were going to pay. It also took forever (over an hour)  to get sat even though they made it seem like it would only take about 20 minutes or less. Absolutely terrible service here. Do not trust the staff, they're only here to make money and do not care about the customers. They made it seem like it was our fault and trying to take advantage of a deal which we were not.",

    "text": "Went to Blasted Barley on a Friday night at 7:30 pm. The service and beer were good, and while the food was creative, it lacked in its execution.       Our server, Juliet, was helpful by providing beer samples, discussing beer specials, and suggesting modifications to menu items, such as having the mustard sauce for the chicken and waffle sandwich on the side.      My friends tried two beer: one prickly pear flavored and the other milk and honey flavored. They both enjoyed their drinks.       My friends and I ordered wings, the curry cauliflower sliders, the ramen burger, the apple burger, and the chicken and waffle sandwich. My friends enjoyed the wings, and Juliet remembered all the extra sauces they requested. The chicken and waffle sandwich was also delightful, although a bit sticky from the syrup it comes with. The meat of both burgers was well-cooked, although the apple slices were so thin on the apple burger that I could not taste them, and the ramen burger seemed a bit confused as a concept - there was not much Asian flavor or spice to it besides the noodles.      I was disappointed with the curry cauliflower sliders. I saw another reviewer (Morgan T.) post a picture of the appetizer when she ordered it, and it looks delightful in the picture. When I ordered it, the cauliflower seemed hastily cooked and assembled: there were no delightful char marks on the cauliflower like in Morgan T.'s picture and the lettuce, seeming to wilt from the heat of the cauliflower, was not adequate to contain the roasted red peppers and caramelized onions. The dish was wet, lacked flavor, and was not worth the price.       I would recommend Blasted Barley for the excellent drinks and chicken and waffle sandwich. Our server Juliet was a delight. While there are a lot of neat food ideas on the menu, the details of the dishes were lacking. I imagine the kitchen was just having a rough night, and I hope to have a chance to check out Blasted Barley again.",

Its a rough morning when I can't get my Cup O Joe and even rougher when they charged $6.00 for two lukewarm cups and no refills. What?!?!  Yup. Made for a sad morning as they had NO more coffee or a way to make it apparently. Our waitress Miss Alexa informed us that no more coffee was available and so the breakfast mood was killed. Having ordered already and started on our dishes, we ate our food and drank our Mimosas in silence.  *Chicken Mole Omelette was very tasty. The mole sauce was spot on and the accompanying biscuit was delicious and fluffy. Also must make mention that the potatoes were crispy fried and yummy!  *Eggs Benedict plate was a tad salty and made for a difficult ending having to leave some behind. Again, the potatoes on this plate as well, were very nicely done.   After the announcement of coffee deficiency, we believed it would be at least taken off the bill, which it was not. Ok. After paying, asked to speak with a manager (Tyler) whom was very understanding but only offered a $10.00 coupon for next time. Hmmm, Thank you however not quite sure about a next time.  The last time we were here, on another mishap, they offered a $10.00 coupon which we did not use today. Sigh. Our bill came out $40 minus a $20.00 Groupon but still left a tip based on 40 bucks. No reason to take it out on Miss Alexa.",

While we saw a giant locker of boxed white wine. Having known how this industry works when a place is closing, it was apparent that the venue was going down. The staff had no idea what anything was, what options there were, if any beer was even made there. Head over to PedalHaus you will enjoy yourself WAY more.",

I came for St. Patrick's day and they had their green house beer and $5 Bloody Marys. I've also been here for their penny mimosas! For $15 you can get unlimited mimosas for a penny each.   They do have some of their own brews, which aren't the best I've tried but it's always fun to try a new brew.   Their food looked great! Although I didn't eat, their breakfast and lunch food smelled really good!",

The bacon, pork and popcorn were delicious- just super bummed on the delivery.   In other news, the PB&J burger was delicious! This is the first time we've ever tried this kind of concoction. Small amount of peanut butter and almost couldn't really taste the jelly, nonetheless, it was still delicious. I will definitely order it again.  This place has a ton of selections on alcohol and some fun games on the patio. Great for company HH's or early outings!",

Waitress was overall rude, they were out of champagne but it was confusing because another waitress said they weren't, took 20 min to get our drinks which was 4 small bloody Mary's, one person wanted a mule but they don't make those on Sunday's apparently, didnt have iced coffee, one person ordered a beer and was given the wrong beer, and didn't have fruit that morning.   Also, when my husband went to the bathroom he came back and said there was vomit in one of the urinals.   Oh, there's more. The chairs outside didn't appear wet but the cushions were and so almost all of us had wet pants and the water smelled...   When we asked to speak to the manager the table next to us said \"can you send them our way when you're done\" I asked what happened and they said it took well over an hour to get their food and it was cold. That's when I looked around and everyone pretty much looked like they were just waiting... and honestly it wasn't that busy.   We never spoke to the manager because we decided to cancel our order and it took nearly 20 min to get the check for 6 drinks.... we just wanted out. Ended up walking down to another place that was a world of difference.   I wouldn't even give them 1 star if I didn't have to.",

It's enough out of the way from the main hubbub to not be too crowded while still having a good vibe. The back patio has a bit of a secluded feel, though it's not really). The staff is typically friendly, college age and pretty good at keeping up with your table, though some times it can take a bit to get their attention if looking for a refill.   Jim and I opted this time for the Chicken Mole Omelette, served with nicely cut fresh potatoes and a tasty biscuit. Twyla chose the Huevos Rancheros, which she gave a nice thumbs - up to. Occasionally they will offer Bottomless Mimosas, but not today; though we still enjoyed several pitchers which were reasonably priced and split between the three of us were nice and tasty.   Blasted Barley is a good place to catch a bit of tasty fare, hang out on the patio and enjoy the company of good friends. It's not a high end type of place, just a good spot to spend time once in a while, grab your drink of choice and enjoy the Downtown Tempe atmosphere.",

One of the best servers we've had in a long time and they had several beers I really liked.  The food was outstanding as well, and the ambiance inside was cool too. It was a really hot day (117) so we ate inside, and it felt nice with the big fans running. The outdoor area looked nice but it was too hot to sit out there on this day.  I like the Thai bowl I had, and the others I was with all loved their food too. I would definitely come back if in the area again.  One thing I didn't like was the parking meters - we are not used to paying for parking in our home state, and these just didn't want to work with credit cards (maybe it was too hot, they were directly in the sun). Luckily we had some quarters so all was good, but it would have been nice if the card readers would have worked. Not a knock on the restaurant, but just be aware for those out of towners to note that you need to pay to park in this area.",

When we were there it was pretty chill and the environment was made better by the live music from a guy playing top 40 hits on acoustic guitar. He used his loop pedal to make it sound like a full band. We really enjoyed listening to him.   Onto the beer. Our waiter, Zach, was really helpful for recommending beers and offering his insight. I had the bro easy, which was their take on a coors or golden lager kind of deal. It was one of the better craft versions of A-B styles I've had. If you'd like to stick to craft beers from some of your other favorites, you can choose from the others they had for guest taps such as lagunitas, dragoon, etc. Lots of Arizona beer which was cool to see in addition to their own.   Top it off with a fantastic salad that measured up to the previous reviews and photos, and this was a really awesome experience.",

Our server, Rob, was great and friendly, then the guy who manages the place (didn't get his name) took some time and talked to the table about another restaurant we were thinking about going to.

The waiter was very prompt in getting us water and to talk about our choices of beers. He even brought us samples. I noticed that when our food and drinks came it was from different people and not the original waiter that stopped at our table. He only took our orders. We ordered wine and it actually took us half an hour to get that drink and I had to go talk to him about where our drinks. We kept saying they were coming. The whole time we sat and watched him as he stood in front of the register and not going to get our drinks. We were just about going to cancel them after about a half an hour waiting when another person who hadn't taken our order came with our drinks.",

The price point may be slightly high but Mill Aves lasting business is the businesses not the college kids anymore. As seen most college driven bars close after the spring and summer hits. Most are going to Old Town Scottsdale these days.   They have seemed to bring that unique feel with oversized pong, skeeball, brewer vats, wood grain and more. I'm sure the prices will go down a bit once it starts to get a bigger following.   Cool spot, worth stopping through if your hip, fun and like a good brew.",

This would not have been my choice, but our friends ordered it to share. OMG..so gross. Soggy, grease covered popcorn with chunks of fatty pork belly & undercooked bacon. Who came up with this mess?

    "text": "Pros: Great beer selection on tap. Lots of craft beer to choose from-including several IPA's. One IPA is their own brew. (Is it just me-or does their logo resemble the \"Green Flash\" logo?) Food was pretty tasty. The nachos were good, a little different than other restaurants.  Great atmosphere and decor. I saw a report on the news on how they ordered their tables from a company that recycles old barn wood. Pretty cool.  Nice server-he was training and a little confused, but nice.  Happy hour looks like an exceptionally good value.  In the heart of downtown Tempe.  Outdoor patio is unique. Will be nice when the weather cools down.   Cons: Although the food was tasty, the portions were rather small and the prices were a little high.  Chipped water glass.  Another person in my party asked if the sliders could be baked instead of fried and server said no because they are frozen. He did let us know that they are prepared and frozen each morning, but who wants frozen food anymore-especially when you are paying $12+ for an entree.   Bottom line: I'd probably go back for the cool atmosphere and great beer selection. I wouldn't plan on eating a meal, maybe just happy hour food.",

    "text": "A nice revision of the previous Tavern and I think, good use of one of those classic brick buildings that make up much of the historical development on Mill Avenue. The owners of Blasted Barley wisely made a decision to implement the windows that open up the bar to the outside when the weather is good - something popularized in the creation of HandleBar grill by the Fork and Dagger consortium, which runs so many good eating places on Mill. I also like the outside seating layout and of course, the prominent view of the brewing equipment, which should go into production any day now.  As for eating experience, I will say that the mix of light type on the menus and low lighting can make for a challenging reading experience. Though the faded type is cool, it isn't all that functional so please, back to dark, solid font on the menu and the happy hour menu - I had to get the bartender to help me find a nice Belgian from the menu and even she had some trouble reading down the list - so maybe some larger type as well.  As for the food and drink, not necessarily in that order, they do adjust the glass for the beer one is drinking, which is a nice nod to proper craft beer treatment. I also had the traditional wings off the happy hour list and quite good - seasoned but not overly saucy and served in a nice stainless steel bowl that was rather functional an unique. I hope to come back and try the curried cauliflower sliders.  Finally, I found the culture of the establishment to be a bit of a cultural mishmash with both craft brew on tap, but also beer from traditional large beverage providers, but that may just be an economic necessity due to the location. If those beers don't sell I hope Blasted Barley considers pulling them from a menu as they don't align with the craft beer and distillery brand that I think Blasted Barley is using to differentiate itself. If nothing else, carry those in the bottle but not on tap.   Finally, tried the barrel aged cocktail on tap - hmmm, a bit heavy on the orange peel flavor - I recommend calling it a barrel aged variation of the old fashioned versus a name referring to something provocative as I'm assuming another part of the brand mission is popularizing classic cocktails - I'd like to see that aspect of what this establishment can bring to Mill emphasized and I think there is the population to support that sort of quality cocktail emphasis.  Suffice to say, I like Blasted Barley but I think it is working through a bit of an identity crisis - traditional college bar or cater to that strain of gentrification wafting through the halls of historical development on Mill Avenue? Suffice to say, I'll be stopping by and watching the possible changes but Blasted Barley is a step in the right direction.",

The live music was also extremely loud, to the point you couldn't even hear the person sitting next to you.  The second event was during brunch (which they have changed to include more options now, from my understanding) from what I had read, however once I arrived (at 11) the tapping apparently wasn't happening until 12, which wasn't reflected online and we also couldn't have any lunch items until 12, the lunch items however were so limited that it just wasn't what we wanted at the time and everything except the bagles and lox had eggs, I don't like eggs, so I wasn't going to order any of those. Service was also extremely slow even though the restaurant was pretty empty.  That being said at the first event I had the popcorn of Sustainability and it was Fantastic, I absolutely love it and can't wait to eventually try other things!",

The food is really delicious and the service was outstanding. A special shout out to Monroe who was not only a fantastic server but hilarious as well. Food recommendations-wise, I had the LA Chicken sandwich with fries which are real cut potato vs frozen manufactured. Now that I've been twice though, I prefer the shoestring onion rings over the fries. My daughter had the hangover burger which is enormous and pretty tasty, per her. My husband had the green chili burger and said it was really good. Also consumed amongst visits was pork belly mac & cheese, Philly green chili sandwich (amazing), Blasted Cobb which has over easy eggs instead of hard-boiled, and the footlong grilled cheese baguette. That was the blandest of all but if you're looking for not spicy and not sure what you want to eat; get this. Get the loaded tots!!! We had the beer cheese with bacon and it was divine. All of us loved it. Now let's talk beer. The BB brands were all really good beers. Hubby had a flight and couldn't decide which he liked best. I would go out of my way for their Hefeweizen which has that lovely banana/clove/lightly sweet taste that is found in German style beers. I will absolutely be back and I absolutely recommend this place to visitors to Tempe.",

Put a couple of fried eggs over it, drown it in hot sauce and call it a day. Or at least call it a filling and healthy lunch.   There's plenty of indoor and patio seating and the live music (two dudes on guitar / vocals during our visit) added a nice touch of audio. Also, TV's everywhere for The Sports.   Extensive beer menu and full bar + all you drink brunch mimosas. I didn't have a chance to try any of the house brews but managed to find a delicious Irish stout by SD-based Mike Hess. Plenty of California and Arizona craft brews to choose from.   We popped in for lunch before a spring training baseball game so I can't speak to what this place is at night, but it was a great midday choice to relax and enjoy some tasty food and beer.",

The popcorn was just delicious bacon and pork belly on top of plain old popcorn with dried out Parmesan shreds and needed more sage seasoning.  The Curry Cauliflower sliders were sweet curry flavored onions and bell peppers on top of al dente cauliflower slices - which seemed like a more completely thought-out appetizer.   I had a blood orange IPA but the hoppiness overwhelmed any blood orange flavor.  I then had a dunkleweiss and sample a lager that had a distinct lemon note.  All the beers were clean but lacked precision and focus of flavor. Still, they were enjoyable.",

    "text": "Good Day Yelpers!  Stay away from this mediocre service from managers and bartenders.   This one is for you Rob MacKenzie (manager)  I arrived at Blasted Barley at 11 AM on a Saturday. I was more than excited to enjoy the bottomless mimosas, and I was extremely satisfied with the chicken and waffles. If I ever found my way back to Tempe, I'd consider ordering from this place to-go.   By 3PM my friends I ordered in excess of $200.00 to congratulate my recent graduate of a friend and his girlfriend, with a bill of food plus excessive alcohol. The bartenders dream right?   Now I'm more than happy to tip any bartender, any waitress, I've dated several and I understand where they make their money.   But this review is targeted at their manager  Rob MacKenzie.   When it came time to pay my tab I found I was paying $12/shot of grey goose(5 total) and $2/red bull. I asked the bartender why am I paying for 5 red bulls I did not consume individually?  The manager Rob MacKenzie came over and said that's how it is, you pay for the red bull with each red bull vodka.   I replied I understand that logic, however why am I paying for the majority of a red bull and I don't get the left over red bull? I continued by saying in the future, based off of my experience with the Capitol of Nightlife (Los Angeles) being my hometown, you should consider changing it to be more reasonable because that's silly.   He flat out insulted me in front of three employees and two of my friends and said \"Yeah there's no way that's going to happen\"  I decided, the only way to send a message to management, was to punish their daily voice of opinion. And 0 their tip on the bartender. Now mind you, this bar tender barely started her shift. She didn't deserve the $40.00 tip I intended on giving her. Rob MacKenzie ruined that for her.   Rob MacKenzie needs to learn customer service, he knows nothing of that skill. Nor does the bartender girl (the new one) who thought it would be acceptable to shout at me as I walked out the bar.",

It was like an overpriced deli sandwich at that point and didn't have any flavor. We told our waiter and his response was \"oh they were probably out of ground turkey in the kitchen. I don't know what it is supposed to be. I haven't looked at the special today\". First, our waiter should have known what the special of the day was. Second, a restaurant should ask us before making a substitution like that.  We would have ordered something different from the menu at that point. He didn't apologize and just awkwardly walked away like we did something wrong for asking about it.   I got the kale and beer salad. It was okay. I am torn to say if we would ever come back based on the experience we had. The only good part of the place was that it is dog friendly on the patio.

We then asked for a manager Thompson who stated this is an every weekend thing because the kitchen is small!! And the food came out wrong  Comped 1 meal after making us late for a baseball game  (while we waited 2 hours for food) and tried to take 20% off but when I checked bill even that wasn't right !! We didn't send food back, afraid it would tAke 2 more hours!  Would never go back to this place !! Avoid the shitty service and go somewhere else!!",

We did not have to wait a single minute for a table and was greeted by our waitress in under a minute.  The food was phenomenal as well as the drinks.  The employees were nothing short of outstanding and made the experience 100 times better.  Definitely a spot to stop by if in town!",

Unless you are a vegetarian, it will not disappoint! The grilled cheese is also note worthy. Will drive to Tempe to visit this establishment again.",

The bartender gave my debit card to someone else and didn't apologize or acknowledge me, she instead had her boss come speak to me. He was really nice and extensively apologized, but the person who had my debit card already spent money on it. I had to call my bank at 1am and cancel my card and file a report. I was visiting from California and now I didn't have a debit card. I would just have liked her to acknowledge her mistake to me instead of running away.   On the bright side ! The beer was pretty good and the atmosphere was fun. If I get the chance to visit again, I'll just make sure not to leave a tab open  ;)",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal, at least from a food stand-point. Being from North Carolina, I find it difficult to find good BBQ. Surprisingly, I had to concede that their  BBQ pork sandwich was pretty darn good. They had an incredible list of beers on tap, so much so that I had no clue what to order.  I was allowed to try any beer that interested me to make the best decision for my meal (I decided on a darker, Huss Rice Pudding).  By far the best though, was the Pork Belly Mac n' Cheese. The seasoned flavors burst in my mouth and the crunchy housemade chips are the perfect compliment for the cheesy deliciousness.   Now, on to the atmosphere: Inside seating was a bit dim, and the music was present but not overpowering by any means. To dispel the dim lighting, they kept both the front and back doors open, where there existed seating outside as well.  In the front is covered tables with large comfortable benches, and in the back is a firepit with tables scattered throughout and couches that just make you want to sink into them. Both locations made me almost wish I had sat outside!  All in all, this place, as a lunch or dinner venue, was fantastic. Everyone was friendly, the food was unbelievably tasty, and the ambiance was beyond pleasant. Have no doubt,I I will be returning here often.",

All of us gave big thumbs up on the food.  We all had brunch items.  The bacon is so good.  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was awesome, maybe the best I've had.  This was our first time here, so don't know how the service is when it's busier, but the 3 servers that we're working this morning all appeared to be taking care of business with their respective tables.",

We went for brunch a while ago and some of our food came out cold. We also had leftover  lipstick on a glass... really just underwhelming. Not terrible, but I don't know that we'll go out of our way to eat here again. This may be just a place we go to have a few drinks on the patio.",
