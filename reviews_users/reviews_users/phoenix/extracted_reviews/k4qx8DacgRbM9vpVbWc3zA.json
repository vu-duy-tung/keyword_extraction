These were by far the smallest portions I've ever received in years. I'm dead serious 10 boneless wings (2 sauces) and 10 shrimp (Cajun) and these pictures are all I got. It feels like they cut the wings in half and then served them to me. These were appetizer portions for a full meal price? I'm extremely disappointed. So much so I asked the manager about it. All I'm getting is a shrug and a \"blame our distributor\" reason for why the portions are so small. I'm seriously feeling like I've been cheated. For the record he offered me another order but I felt so ripped off I didn't take him up on it. I wish I had. This was really disappointing. My server was great, the beers were cold but I've never encountered such a small order masquerading as a full meal before. This wasn't okay. I think someone is cheating someone somewhere in regards to this.",

Eating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.  My only \"complaint\" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \"less important\" then maybe the dine in patrons.",

    "text": "Brittany, you are a TERRIBLE waitress. You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.  My friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, \"Umm, can we get some service??\" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table.   This blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for \"not seeing\" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips.   My friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,\"Sorry guys.\" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great.   If you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress.",

I tried crab legs for the first time and was satisfied. They didn't have crackers for the shells so it was pretty difficult eating crab without crackers. I particularly enjoyed the teriyaki wings, bone in. Never had a problem with the food but just nothing great.  The one thing I felt weird about was homeless people staring at customers while they ate their food. Our waitress even approached our table after our meal and asked us if we saw anyone take her tip off a table she has just served. She accused the homeless man we saw watching everyone eating of stealing the money. I thought that was low-class and not something that should be mentioed in front of other customers. I also thought management should have asked the homeless people to leave prior to the money being \"stolen\".  Overall, it was so-so.",

The food is hooter fare, so if you like it this place is for you. Personally, I am a huge fan of hooters wings; they just hit the spot. If you don't, well the beer selection is now quite extensive; and after a few beers does food quality really matter? Let's be honest ... at that point you are just trying to slow down the drunk.   All in all, it was a much needed cosmetic update to a great part of downtown. It's a hooters so the waitresses are friendly, the food is good, beer is ice cold and it's worth the time. If you just went to a Dbacks game, you are less than a 10 min walk. Check it out.",

All the dance moms and the kids swarmed every restaurant that did happen to still be open (there weren't many).  I headed to Hooters.  My hunch was right: none of the dance moms and kiddos were there!  Got a ceasar salad and some sliders to go.  Very average.  Not terrible.  Not great.  Slightly overpriced.  I usually like the wings at Hooters.  Maybe I should have stuck with that choice.",

I ordered the 10 boneless wings lunch special and my buddy ordered the chicken sandwich. 45 minutes later we finally got out food. Some of my boneless wings were at best the size of McDonalds chicken nuggets. The rest were smaller and to even out the 9 \"regular\" size nuggets I got, I think they threw in a few pieces left at the bottom of the bag to make it 10. I went there specifically for the wings because of good past experiences. This experience with the food was terrible.",

I got my ole faithful COORS LIGHT!!! She got Patron Margarita! The bartenders were slammed but were great at checking up on us and making sure we were ok. On our refills another bartender made my sisters drink and when my sister tasted it right away she knew it was not patron. The Original bartender quickly fixed the problem and made her a fresh one. It was great customer service, except for the wrong drink being made... All she had to do is read the ticket... It was my sisters birthday and they were more then happy to help me embarrass her! They had her dance on a bar stood and flap her wings. It was fantastic. Overall good night. Definitely go back again.",

They bumped up the cost of meters, or you can park down the road in the expensive lot. Add to this the high cost of wings with NO MEAT on them. None, seriously, anorexic little chickens all wingless for this place. And I like smaller, less fatty wings. But I also like meat. And I do not want to spend $10 on an order of wings that result in one tablespoon of meat. Second issue is that the outdoor smoking section opens into the restaurant and stinks the place up. So, sayonara AZ Center. Worst of the chain, locally.",

    "text": "This is hands down the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had. It was obvious upon sitting at the bar that the location was understaffed. The bar was messy but it became ultra clear when \"Bre\" the bartender came over with her hands full and said \"I'm sorry you have to give me a couple minutes I'm really behind\" we told her it was ok and to take her time. Meanwhile she washed some dishes and told us of a bar crawl that put her so far behind - I am a former server/bartender with 12 years experience, she could've been taking our order while doing this instead of complaining about her night. Several minutes later, she came back to take our order. After this, she made not 1, but 3 trips back to us. 1 to drop the check, 1 to drop a water, 1 to drop my cocktail... would've saved her 60 seconds if she did all these things at once - think of all the time she's wasted all night not consolidating her steps! No wonder she's behind!! Our check was printed - time stamped 8:40 pm... come 9:08 pm we still hadn't received our app, so I saw the manager - \"Darrel\" at the service bar. I asked him his name and if he was the manager, pointed out that we waited for 28 minutes for an app and he quickly proceeded to help us. Wonderful our app came and he said our other food was ready. Then they say that only 1/2 lb crab was made and that the other 1/2 would be right out.... 20 minutes later, I asked Bre to have Darrel come back out - at this time he's walking around the dining room on his cell phone. Bre is at this point having a mental breakdown and looks like she's going to cry. Darrel shows up and Tells me my crab will be right out and I just ask him to take the other half off the bill and he responds to me to \"not yell at his waitstaff\" which I never did - of course to be lied about by Bre and then to be treated so RUDELY by the person who \"runs this place\" (his words, not mine) set me off. Then his nasty attitude got worse and he decided that he would \"get our check\" and \"there's the door\" to tell us to leave. I have NEVER been treated so POORLY by people who are to SERVE the guests of their establishment. It's HOOTERS, no one expects you to have class, but really you should have some MANNERS!!!!!!!",

The server took our order so we waited for like about 30 min. It was a long wait time but I thought to my self they probably busy, but I saw the restaurant and it wasn't full at all. So after the thirty min the server comes back and tells us what did you guys order again. I was like WHAT. She had responded that they lost our ticket. I was so irritated but I was like we already here so might as well wait. We told her what we ordered and then left. The manager showed up like 3 min later and apologize and said the would pay for the shrimp but it would take another 30 min. So we waited an hour for our food and the worst part was that the wings had barley any sauce and the shrimp were so under cook and it didn't even look like half a pound. I love Hooters but after yesterday it just knocked a few points down. I would recommend to magement to look at the food before going out and making sure it well dome, also to keep track of your ticket orders.",

When the fights were over there was still a group of people waiting to get in and my friend asked how come the other people were not being allowed in. The manager then yelled and started pointing his finger in my friends face and said he had been more than accommodating, completely lost his cool ranting and raving and we were now being kicked out. This was completely unprovoked and it is obvious he has a screw loose. We of course left with our friends and several others got up and walked out.   Who's in charge here?

    "text": "So today is the third time my company has tried placing an online order for food. The two previous times they did nothing to compensate. This is our third occasion and the Manager Juan told us that because it's a technical issue, we cannot be compensated in any way. Online ordering is a service you offer within your company. We as a business choose to make our orders online to have the convenience of picking up the food quickly. Not only did I just spend an hour off the clock, but now our entire staff waited 2 hours now due to this inconvenience. If there is a technical issue on the end of the business, and we have a confirmation for the food order it is certainly not a technical problem on my side. We order large orders anywhere from $150-$250 every weekend and it looks like they don't want our continued business. I thank Aleona for her great customer service and ability to try to make the experience better. Perhaps she should be considered for a higher position since she was able to offer a better experience than the MOD. Very disappointing.",

I was so shocked and annoyed. Just the fact that the manager is going to come out and asked if I stole a shot glass actually made me cry. I asked the manager why would I steal a shot glass ask him do you want to see in my purse I hope in my purse and showed the manager. Inside of my purse dentally be gone to state a lot of racial comments.

Once seated and handed our menus we were then ignored for almost 10 minutes as we watched other people around us getting attention. No one ever came to our table at all. At that point we left. I don't have high expectations but I will not be ignored. Too bad for them. We had come there a lot and usually left a good tip. Well not anymore.

Host then got us waters and said our waitress was talking with the manager and will be with us soon. Keep in mind, more than HALF THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!! 10 minutes later we put in our beer and food order. 15 minutes later we were served the beers after having to make eye contact with Ciara (because she was too distracted talking to co-workers.) The food took forever to get to us and what do ya know? THE ORDER WAS WRONG. Asked for no meat on the nachos and there was meat so we had to wait longer. She completely forgot about the salad and said no worries I'll fix it... Well no kidding, am I suppose to go and fix your error?! 2 hours into this and we have the correct food and really just want to leave. Were told the nacho were going to be taken care of because of the mess up.. No, the receipts (all 4 for whatever reason) were all messed up. At this point, we asked for a manager and then had to wait about 10 minutes because he was no where to be found. After getting he charges fixed we sat for nearly 20 more minutes waiting to pay our tab. We took the tab to the bar where they said we couldn't pay there! Literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in the 30 years I've been alive. Worst waitress. Don't waste your time unless you want to be pissed the hell off.   Checked my bank statement today, 2 days after this happened, to find out the server ADDED an $8 tip! Absolutely outraged.",

    "text": "Almost every time I decide to eat here it completely ruins my day. I can't believe I keep coming back here with all the comparable Happy Hour options in the area. Maybe because I am a college student living on a budget and the idea of getting their $6 wing special while watching sports seems too good a deal to pass up when it crosses my mind like once or twice a month. Usually, I am disappointed by my experience because the waitresses don't keep my water glass full and it takes too damn long for the kitchen to get the food out. But today definitely takes the cake for my worst experience ever at this restaurant. After sitting at the bar waiting about 30-40 minutes for my food I noticed a male employee bring food out to the gentlemen who ordered 10 minutes after I did. I was mildly fuming because it looked like he had ordered the same thing I did. When the bartender came over around to him and said \"Oh sorry I thought you had ordered bone in wings.\" And she takes his plate and as she walks by reassures me that my food is coming. Girl: I am not an idiot, I can tell that your manager brought my food out to someone else and the kitchen staff would have to start over on my order. Own up to it: Get the manager over to apologize to me and offer me some kind of discount. She never even came over to explain to me the situation and offer to make up for it herself. Soon the guy who originally got my order received the food he ordered and I was sitting there at the bar with a phone that was now out of battery, pretending to watch the NFL Network. The waitress apologized again and I asked her point blank if the other guy had been given my food. She said yes but did not offer me anything to make up for the shitty experience. And how much longer it would take to get my retired order? After going to check with the kitchen she assured me it would only be 4 minutes. I waited for 8 minutes, watching as food came flying out of the kitchen. Not my order... I then got up and left feeling completely ashamed, hungry and beyond infuriated: I was done wasting my time there.",

The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.  It's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return. I open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about? I read the negative reviews thinking this is not True. I now believe the \"hype\" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.  Honestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.  To simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon. The negative reviews didn't lie.",

Soon the manager came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.  When actually it states blacken season mix, not breaded.  It doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.  Also she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.  I had it other locations before just 6 mo ago (but it could be new for Arizona).  I ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded or battered food.

My party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating.",

My sandwich came with fries instead of the onion rings I ordered and our fried pickles were half cooked. I would let all of that slide if they were really busy but they were not there were empty tables everywhere. Our server didn't even check on us after we mentioned that we didn't order chicken on our nachos so I got to be thirsty the whole meal since my drink was gone by the time we got our food.

I was there with 2 friends, for 2 hours.  The place was not busy, just after noon on a Friday, downtown, and waitress was not attentive.  The wings have not improved.  Thank God I didn't have a busy day at work, so I had the time.  It wasn't just us, the table next to us was shocked at how long everything was taking too.  The only thing that was good is, and why I gave them 2 starts instead of 1, they will validate your parking.  One of my friends ordered the \"Triple Dog Dare You\" wings, when our food finally came out, he did not get them,so we got the sauce on the side, not hot at all.  I rarely give bad reviews, but this one is totally warranted.  I think they were doing waitress interviews in the back of the restaurant, I kept seeing gals walk in and talking to a big guy in a Hooters polo.  If he was a manager, he was not managing very well.  It's really too bad that a place as iconic as Hooters, does nothing to improve.  I usually put a \"Then Hank walked in\" story in my posts, but I don't even feel like it.  If Hank walked in, I'm sure he would have, for once, improved the experience.",

If you've been to one Hooters you've basically been to all of them, the only visible change is the quality of the scenery. Having said that, Hooters has still managed to become an American institution. As most should know by now the food here is one cut above average at best, my nephew once found remnants of a feather in his wings! TASTY DUH! Then again, I don't think anyone goes to Hooters for the food. I've always thought that Hooters could expand their beer line up quite a bit but that has yet to happen.  My primary motivation to go here is to set the mood for the rest of the evening, is that simple! Another reason is logistics, this is a good staging area for when your new in town and need to get a feel for where the action is. I agree with Kimberly. Hooters is hooters. However I disagree with her rating! LOVE THIS PLACE!",

We were both friendly, in cheerful moods, and we are both normal (some *might* even say good) looking 30something guys. Our troubles first began when my friend asked if the buffalo chicken strips came with any sauce (blue cheese, ranch, whatever). She gave him a dirty look and said, \"Uh, well, the chicken strips come with chicken.\"   We also ordered fries with a little mini-container of cheese sauce. The cheese sauce ran out pretty quickly. We asked for one more mini-container-thing. And she told us they were out. This really aggravated me after having to deal with her rudeness for the previous 45 minutes.   As we finished, my friend had the gall to ask her for a glass of water. She gave him an obvious look of irritation and said ok. Ten minutes later, she came out with the bill and plunked it on our table. My friend, being more polite than she deserved, said simply, \"Oh and could I also have a glass of water please?\" She just walked away from the table and only with her back to us did she again respond with an annoyed, \"Sure.\"   Responding to some of the other amusing reviews, I come to Hooters now and then only because I live downtown. It's open late and has eats. Not good eats, but eats. This has got to be the weirdest Hooters I've ever been to though. Doesn't the meth addict image clash with their corporate philosophy or something?  EDIT: I've upgraded this from one to two stars for the time-being. I sent an excerpt from this review (I left out the part about meth addicts) to the Hooters website, and a regional manager called and talked to me for 20 minutes. He apologized, and was very sincere in expressing his own frustration that a downtown resident of all people would get such poor service. We had a pretty fascinating conversation after that regarding the history of this Hooters: it was the first Hooters in the Valley (1990!), and at one time the 5th busiest one in the nation. But downtown went through a major decline in the mid to late 90s and this location suffered both in terms of attracting customers and employees as a result. Hot chicks want to work in Tempe, Scottsdale and Ahwatukee where they live or go to school, so persuading them to work in what was then the ghetto of downtown was tough. Hooters is hanging on to this location despite such poor business because of its belief that downtown is going to pick up, and especially because of the Sheraton that's going up right across the street.   With all that said, I have to say that I'm a huge supporter of downtown businesses, and even though this is a chain restaurant, the company invested in downtown back when no one else wanted to and has stuck through ever since. That counts for something.   Two stars for now. Hooters is sending me some gift certificates so I'll go again, see how my experience is, and revisit then.  EDIT 2: I got a very very very generous gift certificate in today's mail (8/29), along with a very nice personal letter from the regional manager. Since my review's only genuine complaint about this Hooters was the service, the warm and fuzzy feelings the company's attention to my complaint has given me are themselves worth bumping this up to 3 stars for now. The manager told me, as he did when we spoke on the phone, that they are doing the best they can to improve things. It's clear to me that it will take some time. So I'll give them a break and continue going there, with patience and sympathy for their plight.",

The food is terrible quality, and the drinks extremely \"well measured\" meaning they are not strong. Hence why I can drink 12 margaritas in a 6 hour period and still be coherent. They sure charge for them like they are doubles though. There are a few girls working here who are very attractive and friendly (not to sound like a dirty old man, just that usually Hooter's has the worst service) and that definitely helps.",

When I brought this to the attention of the manager, at least I assume she was the manager because she wasn't wearing the Hooter's costume, she was uninterested, unfriendly and never came to the table to check back in. We sat with empty glasses most of the night.  With so many other places to eat in downtown Phoenix, I would never go back and neither would most in my party, except my nephew, who goes there for a whole different reason.",

I brought in my Brother in law because i had bragged about how great it was at this specific location. Well let me tell ya, i regret ever speaking of it now. Its pretty embarrassing bragging about a place and then getting the service we did. Jasmine waas our server on a tuesday night, particularly slow. Our daytona wings came out quickly, but after we got our food the service dissappeared! Where was our server? Oh in the front hula hooping with coworkers. I got 1 refill after waiting an eternity. Was never asked how my food was, never asked if i wanted dessert, or merchandise. Betteryet, im not sure she cared. I actually wanted to try the key lime pie this time but she never checked back to see if we needed anything. We basically felt ignored 90% of our visit. She was pretty quick to hand us our bill without even asking if we were ready to go. Jasmine find another job. How do you go from exceptional service to Horrible service? Will not be returning here, maybe for take out. I considered asking for same server as last time because she was great but why not have all the servers on the same level? A $50 bill for crappy service. I normally would have tipped 40% but that night, %5 for 5% service.This was really an upset. FAIL.",

    "text": "Terrible service. Arrived on a Tuesday night. My friend arrived before me and she waited to be helped when she walked in as she wasn't sure if she should seat herself or wait to be seated. The guy who appeared to be a manager (shorts and a baseball cap) walked by and ignored her twice before finally asking if she needed help. (The rest of our visit he did a whole lot of nothing standing on the patio. Wait, I take that back. I saw him pour one beer.) I arrive about 10 minutes later and join my friend who is sitting outside. She has a beer she ordered, and I wait for a waitress to come and take my order. She shows up about five minutes later,  I order a beer, and we place a food order. I sit waiting for my beer, and nothing. I look over to see our waitress talking to her fellow workers at the front of the restaurant. There are about four of them with a couple of them sitting on the counter by the front door. Thank goodness they don't serve food on that counter!  I wait a few more minutes, cutting her some slack, when I finally get up and walk inside. I ask her from the door if I can get my beer. They all look at me like I am a freakin alien or something. My waitress finally comes forward and I ask again if I can get my beer. She has a confused look on her face until it dawns on her that I ordered a beer. She repeats what I ordered and says she'll go get it. A couple of minutes later a different girl brings my beer. The food arrives and is fine. You can't really screw up a chicken sandwich and fried pickles. We were there a little over an hour and she checked on us once. (they weren't busy) So much for a second beer for me. We asked for the check, and it took 10 minutes for her to come back and collect  it. On top of her being a bad waitress, she had the personality of a door. Didn't smile once, and looked like she hated her job. Seriously doubt that I'll be back.",

AnyONE that loves wings has a specific way they like them... MY way: ALL FLATS/EXTRA CRISPY/NAKED/SAUCY. Okay great that she said they could accommodate me. The order comes out 10 min later not crispy and not all flats!!! ONLY 3 FLATS!!!! No. Sent it back. Let me point out the fact that for extra crispy wings it is AT LEAST 22 min (serious about my wings). This time around I wait 25 min and yes it was all flats... the problem was THEY WERE COLD! OMG! I figure the team or \"cook\" in the back was disgruntled that day and tried to make a point?! I sent those back as well and let the waitress and the manager know. I never wanted anything free... I paid for the couple of beers that was had and even left the waitress a tip. It was a horrible ordeal (because I was so hungry) and I WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!!!!!!",

I joked they must be hiding something under that lettuce.The Dakota wings my all time fav now disgust me was asked if i wanted them breaded or naked, never knew there was an option thought they came naked so I changed it up and said breaded, 2nd mistake. I swear the wings were recycled and I'm a very big wing critic. We asked for channel to be turned to a sports station vs the infomercial that played on the tv we faced, asked 3 times never got changed. The place looks old and run down I used to go there late 90s but never again and to top it off and prove my hiding something and possible recycled wings me and my partner been sick all night and we shared the nachos. Could barely find the chili and chicken and asked for jalapenos on the side but find some hidden under the cheese so I'm done with Hooters.",

My advice to corporate... If you cannot staff your restaurant adequately in a high traffic zone then you should close the doors.",

The food is never more than your standard sports bar \"ok\".  Some better moments than others.  You know how that goes.  But with us, we aren't going so much for the food - as for the sports.    Living in the downtown/South Mountain area, there aren't many sports bars as it is.  Then you narrow down which ones are showing the events you want, and we often end up here.  Especially for boxing!  One of the things I like about Hooters, and this one in particular, is that if you want to see - you have full view access.  But the TVs are high enough that if you could care less, you don't have to be staring at a television.  The problem is, it's Hooters.  If you aren't looking at the TV you have to be careful what it looks like you're looking at.  Is there such a thing as viewer's guilt?  Maybe there should be.    Sounds bad, but totally honestly - I just feel really bad for the girls who have to walk outside on a chilly night.  The comments that they have to deal with can be really awful.  There should be some kind of a \"Bad comment\" jar, like the old-school \"Bad word\" jars when you cussed.  The waitresses should be able to just walk over and hold out the \"Bad comment\" jar and make them pay up.  Guaranteed \"he got caught\" standing ovation from everyone in surrounding tables.  It's a thought...",

It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.  I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat. I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well.  It was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.",

One person ordered a cheese dip app and we got entrees. 20minutes later she brought out water and sodas.   We let them know we had to go back to work in 20min so could have our food in to go containers. About 20-25 minutes later they brought our food out including the appetizer. It took 30+ minutes for them to make cheese dip! Most of it was cold so it must have Been sitting there for a while.   One of our members was a presenter so she had to leave before she could eat. I asked her food to be comped and the manager told us in a nasty way that this is typical service and normal wait times. Maybe normal at a restaurant where everything is hand made. But at hooters it should take 5 minutes to get your drink, 15 to get your app and like 30 min to get your food max.   Then he told us we had only been there for 20minutes. I think the manager is the problem here. He was so rude. Waitress told us the kitchen was backed up and they lost tickets. Manager told us this was normal wait time. The cold food told us that someone took a long time to bring out our food. I don't know who was making our water from scratch for it to take 15+ minutes to come out lol.   By the way there were about 10-15 people in the restaurant so it wasn't crowded",

Actually our server was great and quite resourceful.  When the table behind us had a food complaint, she first said, \"I'll let my manager know\".

First to start off they were very slow the server Jamie said they had slushy margarita's so I was excited until she brung my spouse & I watered down supposed to be slushy margarita's!. Next remind you they were slow I ordered the all you can eat wings which starts off with ten wings & when u reorder more they come in sets of 5. Not only did Jamie get my two order flavor of wings wrong she served us COLD WINGS!!!!. Jamie had a bad attitude than when I was ready for the bill I had to get another server's attention so Jamie could get our bill as a server I know your supposed to be attentive to your tables & that which she lacked in being attentive. I would highly not recommend this Hooters.",

The spicy shrimp were delicious and so were the wings we ordered.  Our server was trying her best to be attentive but with a large table next to us they kept her busy. The wings took longer then expected and with a not so busy place I just wonder how long must someone wait to have their wings.  Anyways, we were across the street at the Sheraton so this place was ideal for us.",

Spoke to someone twice that we were still waiting second time was to a manager! And still no one came out to help us. There was another group that was also waiting and they actually left before we did. One woman from the group also spoke to someone twice! Poorest job of customer service I have ever seen! I understand it's a Saturday night and it's busy but 25 min and not even a drink order is ridiculous! After we talked to the manager the second time he should have personally came out and took all of our orders! I saw one waitress come out and check on someone that had already been sitting there and finished with his food and then proceeded to just pass all of us that hadn't even gotten to order yet. Completely ignored us. I used to come here all the time and even on busy nights when there was a football game still never waited this long. Will never be coming back here again! This place lost a lot of money tonight!",

The crowd was into the game too which was nice.  Food is average at best. I had the western bacon BBQ burger with fries and it was just okay.  Service was great. Waitress was super friendly, cute, and a college student. Another college aged waitress stopped by to take away my glass and overheard me talking about disciplining my teenage kids and she joined the conversation with her own story on how her mom took away her cell phone and computer privileges.  Anyways, i was impressed with how friendly the service was. They kept asking if everything was okay, if we needed anything else, extra water, etc. Maybe we got a good table near the food prep area and this made it convenient for waitress to come by often.  The bottom line is that you go to hooters for the sports, drinks, and waitresses but not really for the food.",

Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!",

I arrived around 545 to watch the preliminary fights and snag a good seat for some friends that were arriving a bit later. I had a few beers and ate a good burger, food was good. The service the ENTIRE time was good, just super attentive and on point. the only slightly-annoying-but-not-a-huge deal issue was that I had  my table and was there for over an hour watching the fights. Once teh place started to fill up, the hostess informed me that I couldn't save any seats and that it was first come first serve. Not a huge deal as I don't mind sharing a table, but tell me that up front so it's not an awkward surprise when you just arrive at my table with some random people. In the end, no biggie. I was able to get a few extra chairs and all was well (and I totally understand having to make room for people that are already there vs people that aren't). All in all, great service and a good place to watch the UFC fights downtown. I'll DEFINITELY come back to watch the fights.",

You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else.   customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it.",

I've been here with friends about three times now, two of them to watch a fight, the other time because it was the only place within walking distance that had food.  All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.  We went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered \"hot\" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.  Friend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.  Friend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, \"Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?\"  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.  Overall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.  Oh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.  Always has a bunch of random crap that no one ordered on it, and the girls act all put out when we point out that no one ordered half of the bill that they're trying to charge us for.  Keep an eye out on that receipt.",

    "text": "Ok, this review is for 75th Avenue/Thomas locationin West Ridge,  it will always be West Ridge to those who have lived here that long.  Please cook the wings long enough so that they are not raw inside and how dare you charge 50 cents for ranch,  could see your point if you gave one ranch per order of wings sold but to expecct us to just pay extra for dipping sauce is just wrong.  It is bad enough that we have buy celery and carrots!  I don't go to the 3rd St. location anymore, I don't believe I should have to pay so much to park in the garage.  I used to do a movie or two,  eat at Hooters and shop all in one day or evening but now that the parking is so high,  I haven't been to Arizona Center in two years.  I would take the light rail but that is almost as much as the parking.  These things just give Hooters an ugly name.",

    "text": "Here's the letter I wrote: I've done my fair time in restaurants and hospitality and the experience I had this evening truly made me reflect on all my past experiences; good and bad. I thought long and hard about all my guest interactions from serving, bartending, managing, and even from a guest perspective and could not find a time where I encountered such incompetence, not only from the bartender who could not \"dress\" a glass, but from the manager who tried to defend her lack of knowledge by saying, \"It's easier when you have a bottle.\" I don't fault someone for training; after all we all had to learn a skill sometime, but you should have the staff there to support someone who is training. If the bartender couldn't dress the glass, maybe the lazy manager should have showed her, instead of cutting out letters for the \"theme party\" tomorrow. Wait, it gets even better... So after the 20 minute attempt at dressing a mug; we gave up and ordered a bottle. Well it didn't come in a bottle, it came in a pint glass that was haphazardly dressed and thrown into a glass(you know, so the head was all salt...MMMM). My wife was nice enough to scrape it off and move on. My server who was pleasant and helpful the whole time asked if I wanted something else to drink, so I ordered a malibu, pineapple, and splash of cranberry. Now I know this drink isn't going to be hard up on the rum, but I expected a hint of coconut as I passed the drink to my wife and asked her if my taste buds were off. I then thought to myself, well it did come in a tall glass, but after the years of bartending I did for Chili's I never tasted a 1.25 oz pour that weak. I of course brought this up with the manager; Shiela, and the reply will live with me forever. \"Well you should have let your server know you wanted it in a short glass or a heavier pour.\" Really? I responded, \"That is the best answer you have for me? Your bartender can't do simple things and your response is that?\" This is when I clearly poked the angry bear inside of Shiela as she then became very defensive. Citing I do not need to be condescending and speak rudely of the bartender. Have we moved past the point of simple guest satisfaction? I didn't call the bartender a complete F*** up, but wish I would have considering how upset the manager got. My point is that there was many places I could have chose to spend my money this evening with my wife and son, I ended up making a horrible decision, not based upon the food(probably the best plates to come out of the hooters kitchen in a long while), not because of the great service Jovonne gave, but because of the lack of support from the manager who should have been there to support the failing bartender and her horrible attitude.",

I also lied about my age and they never bothered to check.  I was 18, but said I was 19 so I could serve alcohol.  What a little hooligan I was.  I used to think only men went to Hooters. I figured I would be serving pervy, creepy men all night long, but this just wasn't the case.  The weirdest thing to me about this restaurant is that both men and women go, and some even bring their children.  If men, women and children all go to Hooters, this obviously means they're not going to ogle the women in orange shorts.  They must be going (gasp) for the food.  Is this right? Do people really like the food at Hooters?? It's hard for me to believe, but I've seen these customers myself and I'm still baffled.  I ask again, do people truly go to Hooters for the food?",

    "text": "This is one of the best Hooters in america. The girls and wings are hotter than most others in the country.  On a cross country trip 10 years ago I  rode with a friend who was infatuated with this place. There was only one in Mass at the time and he never went, so during our 6,000 mile trek we hit up about a dozen of these places. Some were good, some sucked, but the wings and girls at this downtown phx location made me decide to stay in az for a year.  Food at this location just seems better than the ones up in the northeast. They seem to add alot more spice in order to keep up with the plethora of mexican restaurants in the area. So if you like your wings hot, you unfortunately gotta leave the bland northeast.  Beer as long as you buy it by the pitcher is affordable, but if you come in during happy hour, expected to get nice and drunk while not going poor. As far as the other reason to go to hooters:the girls, you're gonna love this place. Let's face it, all hooters waitress are conning you just like a stripper would at the club. Here it doesn't seem they are faking it that much. Besides that they are hot as hell! With over 100 days of 100 degree heat in the valley of the sun, your use to seeing alot of hot girls walking around with next to nothing on. Yet hooters seems to still pluck away some of the best and stick out. There aren't many reasons to go to downtown phx, but this hooters definitely makes it worth the trip.",

    "text": "Its hooters.  If you really have to read a yelp review on hooters, then you probably shouldnt be going there.   Things to obviously know before entering hooters:  expect greasy food, slow service, chicks only mildly good looking thanks to butt lifts and makeup, annoying guys who think they are all going to be the next UFC champ, loud sports on 13 tvs, and some drunk guy getting into someones face in the corner causing a scene. The good things to expect is good food at decent prices that is fairly consistent regardless of location, good happy hour (depending on when you go), and great cold beer.    I give it 3 (this goes for the whole chain) cause i love their buffalo shrimp and buffalo 'chicks' sliders, and of course the wings.  However, I would give this location a 2 - it seems to attract a questionable clientele.  Last time we went on a Monday, sat outside on the patio watching the end of a basketball game, being only 1 of 4 tables in the place.  These guys were sitting behind us at different tables and started lightly arguing; ten minutes later it escalated to punches and beer being thrown literally over my head with the cooks and managers coming out with the cops on their way - subsequently slowing our already slow food by another 10 minutes.  Lastly, I will say this - DO NOT bring your kids here.  Nothing says classy good parenting like hooters - there is a reason there isnt a kids menu.",

    "text": "Okay, so it's a Hooters - how can you not have fun with it?  Granted, my expectations weren't super high, I've been to other locations and they've always been consistent.  And sure enough - the Arizona Center location did not disappoint.  We were in a group of about twelve, and we all ordered beers and food before going to a movie.  Service was great - (reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky) but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt.  We had multiple servers helping us since our party was large.  My fiance and I ordered a couple of beers (domestics of course, but we made do) and their famous wings.  I ordered two that were the hottest level of spice they came in.  Honestly - they weren't hot at all to me but my fiance must constantly remind me of my lack of taste buds (I recently took on the infamous ghost chili and won - but that is a story for another time).  Everyone at the table thought they were spicy, so order with caution.  We ordered them Daytona style - which means they were grilled - and they were yummy.   The girls were of course pretty!  ;)  They even sang happy bday to our two buddies - who had the biggest smiles on their faces EVER!  The negative to this particular Hooters is the location itself.  The Arizona Center becomes a ghost town at night - and parking in the lot is tricky.  Even with validation you still have to pay after a certain amount of time passes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled - but when I go out to dinner or a bar I don't like having to pay for parking.  It's not like we're in New York or San Francisco!    Regardless - parking issues aside - a really fun time with a good group of friends.  A good spot to hit before a movie or another bar!",

Although I don't really ever expect greatness from their chicken wings. I ordered hot but there wasn't \"hot\" flavor at all. I think their saving grace was that they were breaded. The fries weren't great either.  The location was nice, had nice outdoor seating and the servers were friendly. The food was ready to be picked up in 8 minutes from when I called so it was quick service.  I'd probably go back again if I was stuck nearby and this was my only wing option, if that's what I was craving. But it definitely wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "10/16/2017 Yelp Review  Hooters  455 N 3rd St #190 Phoenix, AZ 85004  I have always been a huge fan of Hooters wings, their drinks, and of course their fun exciting atmosphere. After a long day at work, my boyfriend and I went to grab our favorite wings, sliders, and refreshments. It was about 9 at night, the game just went off, so the restaurant was starting to calm down. So as my boyfriend and I walk into Hooters, we had to wait for about 10 minutes just to be seated, several employees pranced passed us, while not one even said a word to us. So eventually I just said ,let's seat ourselves.  Now I am a firm believer that if a place of business does not greet you within the first 90 seconds then your business is unwanted.But since I had a long day at work, I was not in the mood to deal with the downtown traffic or find a new place to eat. So as soon as we seated ourselves , a girl came rushing out saying \"you usually have to wait and be seated by someone, your not suppose to seat yourself\" in a very negative tone. Then she walked away, and turned back and said \"I guess I'll find someone to service you\". 20 minutes went by, and no one has bothered to serve us. No water, a hello, or how are you doing this evening. My boyfriend became angry and whistled to the waiter at the table behind us outside on the patio, and asked for two glasses of water with lemon.  She came back and brought two cups of water, without lemon. I asked the waiter for lemon and she never came back. Another 10 minutes went by , so we have been sitting outside for about 30 minutes without being served or greeted properly.  A girl finally came, and asked us for our drink order, then we both replied we just want food. As we ordered our food, the waiter was very rude, and was constantly rolling her eyes. After she went to put the order in, she came back in 4 minutes and handed my boyfriend and I our bill. Before even receiving our food. We instantly felt we were getting racially profiled, and treated unfairly because we looked young.So I instantly asked to speak with the manger. While waiting I got up, and asked every table surrounding us , did your waiter make you pre pay before receiving your meal? Every table responded with a no, and became frustrated because they saw how bad we were getting treated. So the manager walks out and I asked him, so is this your protocol for having customers pre pay before receiving their meal, because everyone around us did not have to prepay for their meals. He replied\" this is a new policy in place, please forgive me and my team because this is fairly new\". I said well sir, where is this written down at since this is your new policy? He responded it was just put in place last week, so the marketing material has not been sent in. I said well sir, then how is a rule going to be put in place if you have no formal documentation. He responded saying, well once it gets here I could email it. I instantly became angry because although this may be a \"policy\" then you should make sure you and your team should follow through, and treat every customer equal. He said I apologize could I get you something to drink, on the house.   I am not sure why he asked because we already paid for our food and drinks, so what could you offer us in exchange for the poor service.  So our food came out and we took it to go. Once we got home, there was no dressing for the wings, we ordered all flats and got a mixture of all types of wings, our sliders did not have the proper toppings, and we were given fries instead of a salad as the side.  Our experience, was definitely horrible, I would not recommend going to the Hooters on 455 N 3rd St #190, Phoenix, AZ 85004. The service is horrible, the employees are rude, and the manager has horrible customer service skills. They are in desperate need of a customer service training.  DO NOT GO THERE. TAKE YOUR SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I spent way too much money on food that was worth $5 or less. I would give them 1 star out of 5, just because the lemonade was very refreshing.",

They were extremely understaffed and unable to properly staff a Friday night, let alone a convention night. It took over two hours to receive our food. A drink refill Took over an hour. The manager wouldn't even give us the dignity of an apology or explanation and send the servers to do it. We saw him standing around changing TV channels as the servers ran around frantically/ When we asked to be compensated for our wait - he gave me $2.34 off. My time is worth approximately $1.17 an hour to them. This is my first and last time visiting this chain. Absolutely disgusting customer service.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this Hooters about once a month for the past 2 years, and it seems like every time I come here the experience gets worse and worse and worse. It's clear that the customer satisfaction is declining because recently I've often see the manager walking around checking on the customers. If the manager has to patrol the restaurant to make sure everyone is happy, then clearly the employees aren't doing their jobs right.  The staff of friendly, reliable waitresses as Hooters has declined considerably. When I first started going here, the waitresses were fun, friendly, and fast. Now when the waitresses serve you, you can here in their tone and see in their body language that they don't want to be here. None of them seem enthusiastic about their jobs and their attitude projects onto the customers. The only waitress that's almost always happy is the bartender. But sitting at the bar gets boring, and can get annoying when some creepy middle-aged guy is sitting next to you. If you're a good waitress I will tip you at least 20%. But the past few times I've been here I remember tipping the waitress about 10%, which is what I give for C-rated service.  The food, including it's taste and preparation, has also drastically declined. Two years ago the chicken wings would be a home run. Now they're a double, at best. This Hooters doesn't serve their mild sauce anymore. Why is beyond me. My taste is very sensitive to spicy food. Even something with a little bit of spice will detract from the taste of the food. So without their mild sauce, their least spiciest sauce is their Medium sauce, which has a little kick of spice in it. So now I can't even fully enjoy my wings.  And about 50% of the time, my food comes out luke warm, or even cold, like it's been sitting for 10 minutes waiting to be served. Which is probably what happened since the waitresses hate their jobs.  Also, this Hooters doesn't give military discounts anymore. Really, how difficult is it to give a 10% discount for service members?  It really sucks that this restaurant has declined so much over the years. I used to love going here. Now, I try to give myself reasons NOT to go here. I don't know if because the management changed or if they just have a staff of really crappy employees or if they're using cheaper ways to prepare their food. Maybe all three. But this used to be one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix and is now one of the worst.  If you find yourself in the Arizona Center, try a different restaurant because you'll more than likely have a better experience there than at this place.",

I thought I would give Hooters a try, I had an event at the Herberger Theater, it was across the street and I could eat outside. Unimpressed with the menu, ordered a Taco Salad. Now I have had taco salad all over the country.  This one was different. Maybe I did not read the entire explanation of what this dish was, but usually a taco salad is pretty basic and is composed with several basic items. This taco salad had a scant few. It was a pile of shredded lettuce over some cabbage, swimming in a vinaigrette dressing with a sprinkle of cheese, a small scoop of guacamole and sour cream and four taco chips. It was more like a mediocre dinner salad, overdressed with toppings that did not suit what a dinner salad should be....with a couple of taco chips. I said to the waitress that it was a weird taco salad and her reply was....\"oh, yea\".  So, as I said, last trip to Hooters. If I want a dinner salad swimming in dressing I can go anywhere and just order that, get it and it will be better.......although probably still disgusting.",

The server never showed up to ask how things were.  We never were asked about drink refills, and she never took plates away while we were eating.

I was assured that I would be able to watch the event. I sat down and ordered a beer, then food. I got about half way through my large beer before I was approached by the manager who explained this particular location was having an issue showing the event. I responded to the manager explaining I had already order a beer and food and I only came in to watch the fight.  At this point it was turning out to be a bad experience, in my head money spent, no fight, times wasted.   She offered to cancel my food order then said she would comp the beer. I figured I'd cancel the food, slam my beer and rush over to a different venue to catch the fight, not bad I guess. Then about two minutes later the manager came back and said the food was already made and if I wanted to stick around that my meal would also be on the house as well as my beer. At this point I had nothing to complain about, free beer and free food. UFC could wait.   I was so impressed with how my experience was turned around that I asked for the bar tender manager's name, I was told it was Deja or Dasia. Yay Deja or Dasia!",

    "text": "11 of us went to Hooters for lunch on National Chicken Wing Day on July 29, 2016. The Hooters website advertised all you can eat chicken wings on that day.  When we arrived to the location we were informed that franchise stores such as this one do not participate in the all you can eat promotion.  What a major let down, not to mention the False advertising on their website.  All of us are in the marketing industry and there was no fine print in the website ad explaining exclusions.  We were duped. Instead of all you can eat wings they offered 10 wings and a beer for $12.99 - hardly a deal.  And the beer had to be draft Bud, Bud Light or Michelob Ultra. Based on this unpleasant experience my group has one less place to eat downtown, as we won't be going back to Hooters.",

    "text": "Visited Hooters last Saturday night after the DBack game. I'm guessing it was 8:30 or 9 o'clock. We were STARVING and thirsty for a cold drink.   Scene.. 4 people walk up to a relatively empty Hooters.   \"Table for 4 plz.\" Hostess: \"it's going to be about 20 minutes, we are giving our kitchen time to get caught up.\"   \"HUH?\"  \"Ok so can we sit at the bar?\" Hostess: \"as you can see the bar area is very crowded, and like I said, the kitchen is getting caught up\"  Four confused people look over to a pretty empty bar area. Irritated.   \"Fine, put us down for 4 please\"  End scene.   We got a table around 10 minutes later. Lots of people walked up and turned around and left when they got the same speech. Prob not good for business not to seat people when you clearly have lots of tables.   Anyway food was ok, just munched on appetizers.   Nothing was special. Would have been 3 stars if not for our hostess experience.",
