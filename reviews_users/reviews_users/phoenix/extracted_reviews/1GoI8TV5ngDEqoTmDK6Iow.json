I want to give it 5 stars but I think 90% is a solid summation of my experiences here.  If your new in town this is definitely a must visit and should be a staple for a great lunch dinner or happy hour.  I order the fajitas steamed instead of with oil so it's healthier and only had an issue once getting it that way out of the kitchen (hence the 90%). It's much better that way to me.  Chips and salsa are dangerously good and they are pretty generous with them. I try to exercise self control but they usually defeat me.  Enjoy!",

On the Border makes better food than this place. Never again. The chicken also is like a rotisserie chicken. Gross.",

It is just so yummy. I am a creature of habit and get the Pollo Con Queso every time, and I highly recommend it. It's huge, so luckily it tastes exactly as good re-heated the next day. Maybe even better. If there was anything that could improve, the milder salsa is served in a mini carafe that has to get poured onto your chips directly, which can get messy. But it's really no big deal. And they'd probably give me a little bowl if i asked, I just never have. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try!",

The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about another 5 minutes or so,  all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..  So now we are at Ajo Al's for the first time and I was speechless when I walked out. The service was outstanding our waitress was Theresa who was very professional & friendly. And the food was excellent. As another Yelper  - Steve V was right about the Cheese Queso Dip it was very tasty.  I will be going back to Ajo Al's again soon.",

January 14, 2016 last night at 7:45pm, I ordered the Mexican Stack; its a Lasagna of a Mexican entree. #Delicious! The only issue is in my most recent visit, the bartender was not attentive. When I arrived it took 15 mins before she even said, hello. Then she asked if I wanted to place an order, but never offered a menu. Well how can, I place an order if I don't have a menu to review the 'ah so many choices. Therefore I had to ask for a menu.  Next I had to ask for the warm complinary chips and salsa. While in the past, I've dined here plenty of times before,  I've always been offered chips and salsa. Or it was immediately brought out to me. When the chips where finally brought out, I adked for a side of guacamole. Which took another 18 mins. Then I watched her immediately serve new customers....Whom received prompt service,  chips and salsa,  menus delivered without asking....All customers should be treated with the same prompt attention and respect. It is from the every customer that keeps such restaurants in business. It is the customer's verbal and written reviews that a multitude of other customers will read. The irony is, it only takes one employee (bartender last night)@ Ajo Al's to give customers a bad experience.",

I used to go here and like it, until about a month ago when I went in on a weekend day for lunch and got a nasty surprise.   I ordered my usual - shredded beef tacos.  I took one of the two home as I can never finish all my food.  Later I went to eat the other one for dinner and when biting down, bit into a rock hard \"something\" that cracked my tooth.  I spit it out, put it in a bag and went back to the restaurant to complain.  My server and an Asst Mgr looked at it and determined it was a piece of bone that came from a mistake a cook made while shaving meat off the bone.  I was promised the owner would contact me to discuss the situation and my injury.  Days passed and nothing. I went back in person again - was again promised a phone call.  Days passed and nothing.  I called a few days later and was told the same thing over the phone.  Days passed and well you get it by now - nothing!  I went in person one last time to tell the person at the hostess stand that I was disgusted by how I was being treated.    She told me the owner was out of town now for several weeks.  I told her that almost everyone has a cell phone and if he cared even a little for how a patron of his restaurant was impacted by the food I was served, he'd find a way to get off his ass and call me.  She just looked at me.   This place should be SHUT DOWN immediately. Food safety and customer safety is obviously of no concern here.  Eating here is at your own risk.    Mr. wonderful owner will be hearing from me soon - when I sue him in small claims court.  Had he been a decent human being, we could have resolved this so much easier.",

Nothing seemed spectacular, just standard Americanized Mexican food, but the happy hour pricing was definitely worth while. I sat at the bar, and the service was wonderful.

The service both times we have been here is sub-par, despite not being busy.   Happy hour is the only time I would recommend eating here as the prices are reasonable and the items are fairly good.",

SUPER nice waitress named either Christy or Christine (I forget) suggested the skinny margarita since it's made with real lime. Tasted like the ones we get in Mexico (YUM!). The green corn tamales and Chile rellenos were outstanding. We will be back..... next time we're trying the fried ice cream everyone is recommending.  Well we went back again and it was once again outstanding. Had a frozen mango margarita which was delicious, and the shrimp pork belly tacos were to die for. We were served by another great server, Brianna Lopez, who took the time to talk to us and took care of our every need. Recommending this restaurant to everyone!!",

    "text": "Wow what a night! Stopped by after quite a while. After starting the evening by the bar I noticed something missing! The main artwork that hung for 20 plus years. The way I noticed this was on the way out of the bathroom. Upon asking the bartender about the \"dog\" artwork and who made the decision to move it by the bathrooms vs. in the main area. The bartender responded the owner, and then indicated that he/ she was here now.  A man that was standing around doing nothing responded that he was said owner and the art was moved after they got \"bored of it\". Mind you this art hung in the same place for 20 plus years and was a staple of this location. After hearing that I made a comment about another location changing the art because they were \"bored of it\" and he seemingly shut down. He again asserted his position as owner to which I responded he is the owners son and not the owner. He did not like this. He did however like how my family and I paid for his house payments for 20 plus years of dining at this restaurant. Next I stated is was \"weird\" that they would change an iconic piece of AZ art to near the bathroom to which this \"owner\" responded: \"I am sure you have seen more weird stuff than that.\"  Wait what? Who are you talkin to? I am a business owner Not a business owners kid first of all! How dare you take it personal on a customer? I say back: Are you trying to disrespect me? How are you gonna make assumptions about what I have seen being I am in an AZ/ Mexican restaurant with what used to be good food and this type of terrible service.  Next thing dude is standing behind the bar actin tough askin me to leave? Seriously? Who are you but a child of a moderately successful restaurant in AZ. I have been away for a couple years from this establishment and since then the children took over and are running a very good AZ brand into the ground.  If you want better food and way better service go to La Pinata on 7th ave and Missouri Or go to Phoenix Burrito House on 7th ave and Indian School rd.  Get the cheese enchiladas.   * Update: Let us all be clear and transparent here, the response you read here by \"Patrick, the owners son\" is completely 180 degrees opposite of the response he offered in person the other night. Hypocritical to say the least. If he had Not taken the discussion to a personal level making a comment about my personal life then I would have happily accepted that it Is and Was the owners decision to do whatever they please with the art. What is Not acceptable is when this \"manager/ owner\" felt it necessary to take things personal.  My question back to you Patrick is: why did you attempt to disrespect me in front of the entire bar of customers and your staff? That is why I pointed that your absolutely Not the owner, rather your the owners kid. Patrick, if you have something to say like a man then you walk over and ask me to step aside and say it then. You chose Yelp to act like you were above the situation but really you caused the problem by smiling behind the bar acting like my opinion did Not matter vs. accepting that a long time customer may have a valid position. I will say this my father taught me to be a better man so I walked away before Patricks mouth wrote a check he could not cash on his best day.  So back to you Patrick, what did I miss?",

But we had a family reunion planned and reserved the semi-private room in the back. We called in again later to confirm that we would get that room. But when we arrived tonight, we found that they had already given the room to a different group. No one at Ajo Al's bothered to call and tell us this. Had we known, we would have gone somewhere else with our big group of kids, adults, and seniors. Since we were such a big group and had to sit in the main room with all the noise and being very spread out, we didn't get to interact as much as we would have liked. We made it work, but we are very disappointed that the management let this happen.",

If you can go to either of the Scottsdale locations, you are better off, based on my experiences.  The pollo con queso is great!!! It's the best thing on the menu if you don't care about calories (deep fried chicken burro, smothered in cream cheese and cheddar cheese, mmmmmmm).  If I don't want 2,000 calories in one meal, I go for the Salad Carbone with Chicken.  It's seriously one of the best salads I have ever had.  They marinade the chicken in something wonderful, it's so tender and flavorful, and served with the best jalapeno ranch. !Muy bueno!",

And I could never figure out why, but I have since turned him onto El Molino in Scottsdale and I haven't heard much about Ajo Al's lately, so maybe he just didn't know any better.  Also, I did hear murmurings of trouble with health code violations here a few months back. Those usually don't scare me too much, in all candor, since perfectly good restarants get the whistle blown on them for relatively minor infractions so often that I've grown somewhat callous to their warnings.   Further, I'm sure any problem that once existed is now long gone since there was some press about the incident when it happened.   A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends, but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat.",

It is shredded chicken on top of fresh greens, cheese, tomato, and a black olive or two. I had the italian dressing with my salad and my friend had the jalapeno ranch. We were both happy. The chips are hot and crispy, and the salsa is good. While I normally go during the week around happy hour time, I went on a Sunday afternoon.

The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there.",

I returned to the Valley a few months back, Ajo Al's was on my top list of return to restaurants as it was my top place to go to while I lived here before. Sadly it's not the same. I had a dish with red sauce which was so overpowering I couldn't even eat it. I mean it was inedible. My friend had the same dish and he couldn't eat his either.   We also ordered the queso, fantastic flavor but it was so runny just like water. It needed a bit of thickener so the cheese would stay on the chip.   Lastly, the best part of the meal...I had the prickly pear margarita which was amazing! My friend had a regular and that thing was loaded with the tequila!   Moral of the story...return for Marje's next time!",

    "text": "I was looking for a different place to have Mexican food near my house.  We eat out a lot and were kind of burned out on the normal restaurants in the area so we were looking for some place different.  We used to eat at Ajo Al's pretty regularly up until the early to mid 2000's when the place started to go down hill.  It was late and we needed to eat so we decided to give it a try again.  I am so glad we did. The service was the first thing I noticed that had changed.  It was 8:30pm and the restaurant closed at 9:00 but the gal that waited on us didn't rush us and she was so good at her job.  Friendly, not pushy even thou it was late.  She was awesome.  We got queso dip to go with the chips and salsa.  We needed instant gratification & it came out quickly and hit the spot.  It was Tuesday & they had taco specials going on.  I ordered one each of the  smoked meat tacos - carnitas, brisket and pork belly - with rice and beans.  The tacos were very good and again this is a half hour before they close.  The pork belly was my favorite - great smokey flavor.  Everyone at our table loved their meal and the service.  We have been back several times since that night and it has been consistently good.  Kudos to Ajo Al's for looking at their business and making the changes.  I only wish I had known sooner.",

If you're coming here for the first time - don't be intimidated by the menu. It's very busy (they need a redesign with a new graphic designer asap) but they carry all the Mexican-American basics.

    "text": "What happened to Ajo Al's????? For 15+ years we frequented Ajo Al's @ Scottsdale & Shea. Like once a week for years. It was among the first restaurants in the Valley to start pushing the boundaries of routine Mexican food. Among the first to add a variety of seafood dishes...among the first to add a variety of vegetable options. The service was bright and prompt...the food was high quality and consistently hot and delicious. So 7 years ago (in 2010), I moved to uptown Phoenix and Ajo Al's on 16th St was close. Yay! Or so I thought. My time as a customer there started out well. Same great service, same great menu, same delicious food. I took my friends from South America and France; they still talk about the place and its great Mexican food. However, about 3 years ago, things started to slide. First, service became sloooow and inattentive. The food was not up to their usual standards. Last night, I gave Ajo Al's another shot and it was the last time. A niece was in town and craved great Phoenix Mexican food. Ajo Al's was my first choice. We walked in to a pleasant greeting from the hostess and we were quickly seated in a dining room booth near the end of the bar. Chips and salsa arrived immediately. \"Could we also have hot salsa?\" I ask. \"Oh, we don't have hot today.\" is the answer. Huh? We start on the chips...cold, oily and stale. Huh? 5 minutes go by...then 10...still no water...no offer of drinks. Huh? No one is even glancing in our direction. Huh? Then, we start looking at the menu. Ajo Al's menu is now four small sad pages. The creativity and pushed boundaries are no where to be found. Many of the vegetable and seafood dishes have disappeared. So after reviewing the now minimal menu and still having no idea of who our server might be and still no water or any drink...I tell my niece we're out of here. I stop at the hostess to say \"you know how long we've been here, chips immediately came but no water and no service.\" She looks at me and says \"do you want to talk to the manager?\" I say \"why?.\" She says \"maybe you can work something out.\" Huh? We walk and as for me, never to return. Alas, poor Al's...I once knew it well.",

That ended up being 9.00 for the drink. We then got a folded chicken cheese crisp that was yummy and got steak fajitas. The meat was seasoned well but not worth the 16.00. We spent a total of 47.00 for food that we feel didn't have a lot of soul. I don't think that we will be going back.",

After waiting awhile, the sever came to the table with flan and said that they were all out sopapillas! We were so disappointed and looking forward to them. Not only is it the beginning of the week, but IT'S RESTAURANT WEEK! don't you think they would be more prepared? Especially when they only offer two items for dessert on their restaurant week menu?

Our waitress came by quickly to take our drink order and we also ordered queso dip.  This was very good and encouraged to to eat more chips (see below!).  I ordered the skinny margarita which I did not care for. It definitely did not taste like a \"fresh\" margarita so needless to say I didn't order another one.  Their tortilla chips are house made and come to the table warm...yummy! The salsa was good but a few too many chunks of pepper for my taste. But that being said we went through many chips (read 'we ate way too many') and a couple bowls of salsa!  I ordered the folded quesadilla with fajita steak. This is an appetizer so no accompaniments but I still had some to take home because of all the chips I ate!  The steak was well cooked and had a good taste.  We also ordered the Blanco something or other with mushrooms, the trio of tacos (brisket, pulled pork and carnita) and the pollo con queso. All were delicious.  Our waitress was friendly and supplied our never ending want for more chips!  We could have had our water container filled more often but I guess we could have asked too.  It was pretty quiet while we were there on a Saturday, late afternoon.  Not sure if we'd return because hubby said he likes another restaurants pollo con queso better but it might be worth a try simply for the chips!",

Chips and salsa came immediately. Water was already on the table in a pitcher melting and sweating away, making for a not-so-pleasant mess to stick one's arm in. Salsa was blah-no flavor at all. Chips were good, but, they are chips... After sitting for 20 minutes waiting to order (two other tables sat after us, ordered and were eating already) Ordered the steak fajitas without any sides and no tortiallas. Fajitas came, with sides (what a waste) that I didnt ask for, and the fajitas were chicken, NOT the steak I had ordered, and to top it all off, they were burnt on the bottom, and continued to burn as they sizzled on the skillet they bring them on. (smokey burnt smelly mess in my opinion) Definitely won't be going back to this location ever again. Hopefully my experience isn't valley wide and I will have better luck at the Glendale one, IF I go back.",

Considering the thoroughness of these inspections, and the fact that most restaurants receive at least one violation, having a perfect inspection says a great deal about this establishment.  Because they are apparently doing all the right things to keep their customers safe, my nonprofit, Restaurants that Rock, wanted to write this review to highlight and recognize their efforts.

This restaurant is one of my new favorites.  The cheese enchilda was a great choice.  Excellent flavor.  The taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.  The chips and salsa were very good.  The salsa was not the best I have ever had, but very good.  I wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  I cant stand eating salsa off of plates.  I will definitely return to this location.  Great food and service.",

While this isn't my #1 Mexican spot, it's location has a been a great center meeting point with friends.  The food is never disappointing and service has always been good.  Very good actually.  Oh the stories I could tell about our friend doing some super heavy flirting with one of the waiters.  Though at that level it's hardly even flirting anymore.  More like a direct offer.  But anyhow... He handled it smoothly as silk.  This would lead me to guess they have a pretty good bar, which my friend was enjoying of course.",

However if a step above Taco Bell works for you, then you'll love this place. My friends and I were on a kick for a time coming here, mainly because they have a decent Happy Hour. If anything, you should check these guys out for that. The restaurant itself is nice on the inside and they have a nice bar so you won't be disappointed if you want a drink and some munchies on the way home from work. My advice, if you're going to hit this place, is to grab a seat at the bar, order a drink and an appetizer, have maybe another drink (or two) then move on.",

The \"green\" salsa was one of the best I've had - 5 stars.  The show-buster which gets 6 stars is the \"Spicy Chicken Soup.\"  I read the review of this soup in the New Times 2007 \"Best Of...\" and have to agree that it's one of the better chicken soups around .  Perfectly salted (meaning not overly salty) and with the right amount of pepper.  Nice big chunks of obviously 100% \"REAL\" chicken breast (no fillers, nothing fake about it ) and zucchini and whole baby carrots.  Sprinkled with a touch of corn and rice and small slivers of onion.  Very tasty combo of flavors. Hits the spot on a cold 50 degree day.  The caveat?  My other friend had the lunch combo with a taco and a cheese enchilada, refried beans and rice.  Absolutely nothing special or very tasty about any of the stuff on his plate.  Bland.  Boring.  Cheap-looking and cheap-tasting.  So if you are in the mood for some good, decently flavored chicken soup, and some above-average chips and salsa, give it a try.  If you're gonna order a combo meal, I'd say take your business elsewhere.",

When I informed the manager who took my order once I arrived he just shrugged and said 'It's busy'. The food came out in a timely manner. When I arrived back to collect my order, there was no hostess/host at the front door for at least three minutes. Once I was greeted, the service was very impersonal.

The building is all they have going for them.   Service is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced.   My food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for!  I wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well.   If you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well.   Wild horses, horny handsome straight men, nor hunger or thirst will get me to return to Ajo Al's or recommend it.   Oh and it's not cheap for lunch nor dinner either, considering it's Mexican food and awful. Sure glad my Uncle Al could cook better than this.",

I've eaten at the other two in Scottsdale, and this location is superior, by far.  Great food, great service, super strong margaritas, a girl couldn't ask for more.  I also appreciate their willingness to substitute on menu items.  Here I can get the pollo fundido with shredded beef, which is a big deal for me, considering I'm allergic to chicken.

Every year my Father (or one of my uncles) gets me to split a giant (GIANT) plate (really enormous platter pan) of nachos.  Every year there are at least 20 of us.  Every year the food is good and we have an amazing time.  The menu is expansive, but not overwhelming, so anyone can find something he or she likes (even if you don't care for Mexican food, you can find something more American...without this place feeling like an Applebees...because it certainly doesn't).  The service is not always the best (always nice, but sometimes slow), ESPECIALLY if they sit you on the patio (they usually forget about you there).  I only go there about twice or three times a year, but it certainly isn't because it isn't delicious.  Definitely looking forward to it this year!",

    "text": "It appears that as I get older, I get cheaper.  Such is my reinforced experience with Ajo Al's yesterday.  I stopped in for lunch with my blind friend, who despite having lost his vision years ago can \"feel out\" good food from eight miles away.  We were seated quickly and I started to peruse the lunch menu, only to be shocked that everything was $9.  Since when in the hell is everything $9 for lunch?  That's a dinner entree price, not a lunch price.  Lunch should be $6 or at most $7.    After getting over my Scrooge-like reaction at the menu prices, I ordered the pollo con queso (shredded chicken covered with cheese and a spicy baja cream cheese suace).  It was heavenly as I remember it from years ago.  My dining companion chose the mushroom enchilada, which also was quite tasty.    I still hate the way they serve the salsa here, in tall narrow tumblers.  It's impossible to dip your chips in the salsa container (where is a damn bowl when you need one!) so I had to pour it onto my salad plate and scrape up the salsa from there.  Overall, the salsa is only average.  It needs more kick and this is a big issue for Mexican restaurants in my head.    You do end up with large portions, but I'd like to see them pare down the portion sizes and the prices accordingly.  Two for lunch cost as much as three for dinner the other night at Juan's on Thomas and 16th Street.  That's not right.    So, overall Ajo Al's gets a B for food quality but a D for prices.  The salsa helped me arrive at my three-star rating for this place.  With minor changes, this could easily be a four-star place.  Make it so, oh culinary gods!",

I wouldn't even call it mole sauce. It was more like \"black bean paste.\" Another member of my party had the same dish as I, and we both only ate about half and turned down the offer of the box. And I love almost everything! It was just bland, which is really bad in my book. A person orders mole because they like flavor! No one else in my party complained aloud about their food (but neither did I since I was eating for free), but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas.

I have been a patron for a couple of months, ordering food on a weekly basis, sometimes several times per week via doordash, grubhub etc. I've had a few occassions where the order was made improperly, and I called to inform them of the issue. In the past they were nice, apologetic, and courteous. The manager even offered to comp me for my less than stellar experiences.   However, today was altogether different. I ordered the lunch specials for myself and a co-worker via doordash. One chicken quesadilla, and the chicken fajitas. When we received the order from the delivery driver we discovered to our dismay the fajitas were steak, not chicken as ordered, and they did not include the tortillas which are apart of the fajita meal.  I called them to inform them of the mistake, and much to my shock and disbelief I was met with an angry, hostile gentleman by the name of Patrick who identified himself as the owner. He told me that for some reason they could not get my orders correct, and asked me not to order again from them. He was very agitated when speaking with me, saying he could not compensate me for their mistake because he had did it a few times before. When I asked him if he was blaming me for their mistake, he said no, but that he would prefer that I not order food from them. I asked him if they were discontinuing to deliver  food through delivery platforms such as doordash, he said no. That he wanted me to personally not order any food in the future with them.   Everyone I work with who was privy to the conversation was in unbelief as well, saying how rude and unprofessional his conduct was. Again, they messed up the order, got angry and upset with me for bringing it to their attention and wanting it to be rectified. I've also ordered on several occasions for pick up, and had the pleasure at the time of meeting Patrick. So, he was quite aware of who I was, because I have patronized them often, in person and via delivery. My co-worker called as well to share her disappointment with her order being wrong, only to be told by Patrick that we were running some type of game or scam. Game/Scam? We don't work at Ajo Al's? We don't fix orders, prepare orders, etc.?  With that being said, it is not lost on me that as a BLACK WOMAN I am being profiled as being dishonest, expected to except less than appropriate treatment were I spend my money, and am supposed to not speak up and except whatever someone or some business decides is my due treatment. BLACK COMMUNITY be warned, you're business is not appreciated at this establishment. If you complain, don't order from this restaurant again. Per the owner, Patrick. I hope this review was helpful!",

Instead it was an extremely disappointing experience full of deception and lies. Normally I would order the beef chimi, but instead changed it up with the PORK BELLY and shrimp tacos. I was absolutely excited as they arrived but noticed one glaring omission... THE PORK BELLY. Instead the kitchen decided to substitute PORK BELLY with a mere strip of bacon. Of course I flagged with the waitress who took the dish back to the kitchen for clarification, and apparently they had run out of PORK BELLY.   Bacon is delish, but just the mere fact that no one had told me about a substitution and to serve it like it was normal is just absolutely mind blowing. \"Screw it - let's just serve it like this, they won't notice\" is how I imagined the conversation in the kitchen. Yes, they come from the same animal but everyone knows the two are prepared/taste very differently. Unfortunately this turned me off to the whole experience and will not be visiting again.",

    "text": "tl;dr: Poor service, bland food, waste of time + money during Fall Restaurant week.  We will not return.  Full Review: This is on a Sunday around 2pm.  Not many people seated or at the bar when we walk in. * Barely greeted at the door * Told we could sit \"there\" *points to nearby booth\".  This booth was clean but had the completed check of another on it.  So when I clarified, he was like \"Yeah, that one is fine\".  My husband has to pick up the black check holder and hand it to him to take away \"Oh, sorry\". * Table setting has 3 glasses of water, 2 silverware settings.  This is the table my family of four is seated at.... * There are no Restaurant Week (RW) menus.  I have to go back up to the greeter and he goes \"Oh yeah, sorry\" and grabs them.  Seriously? * Waitress comes to take our order.  I ask her if the margarita's on the RW menus can be swapped out for a beer.  She replies \"Sure, I don't even care anymore\".  Wow...SERIOUSLY..?  BTW, my husband declines and just goes with the 'rita on the menu... * She doesn't take drink orders for our girls.  This isn't corrected for about 15-20 mins... * Salsa and chips are places out.  We only have two plates.  No one comes back around for us to get more until our appetizer comes out...and it was the man who brought our food out who was nice enough to do so! * LONG waits between seeing the waitress as she is also solo running the bar.  Joy... * Food comes out and is just barely \"OK\".  Literally, my kids didn't eat their fries because they weren't good.  Kids not eating fries.  Wow.  My husband and I's tacos range from just ok (Asada taco) to bland and tasteless (fish taco). * We have to flag down our waitress to even try and order the last course (dessert).  We opt to take it to go because lunch has taken an hour and has not been a positive experience at all.  We got the sopapillas and split one in four before hitting the road...  Just meh.  Ended up tossing them when we got home.  The good news is that they are another joint off the list.  With all of the great local spots in the valley, we won't even think about wasting our time and money here again.",

    "text": "This is always a hit.  It's my go-to Mexican restaurant in the area, and the food never disappoints.  I wouldn't call it terribly unique, but the food is really, really solid and they have lots of great options.  I love the taco salads and enchiladas especially.  The one thing I can't figure out is their salsa strategy.  There are chips and two different types of salsa.  One is served in a little cup and is way too spicy for me.  The other (delicious salsa) is served in a carafe, so you have to pour it in something to use it.  Puzzling, but not a huge problem.  I definitely recommend Ajo Al's.",

    "text": "Ajo Al's, I don't know why I keep coming back to you. Perhaps it's because I've eaten at the 90th Street location since I was a pre-teen. I've had good experiences and horrible; guess this is a trait at all Al's locations.  This is the second time that I've visited this location, last time being a year ago and the food was ok. This time the food was mas o menos. We ordered Sangria, however, the sangria served was unlike any other I've had. The server told us it consisted of watermelon juice, brandy and he couldn't remember what else. No wine in sangria? Hmm... Anyways, the appetizer of guacamole was great with a lot of garlic and lime to it; the entrees, at least mine, was downright nasty. I ordered the Garden Fajitas light oil, to be served Garden Fajitas swimming in oil. So much oil I think that by consuming my entree it might serve as a laxative as well as a meal. I didn't eat the fajitas, or the rice because I'm sure it contained chicken broth. On the bright side the Mushroom Enchilada I had was good. Now I know why I visit Al's on an annual basis, if that.",

Everyone's meal was BLAND meat had no seasoning what so ever,  i found myself drenching it in the salsa just to find it half way decent.  This place has to be the worst Mexican food I've had.

We (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.  All of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.  Ditching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.    Couldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)",

I'm not a huge fan of their salsa, but they have a decent hot sauce. Their sangria is not actual sangria made with wine, but a fruit juice blended drink (beware). Top shelf margs are awesome.

Ajo Al's changed that for me.. My first order was their infamous chile relleno ( I had heard about this place prior to moving here, from friends in New Mexico, Texas, even New York!) so I had to see what it's all about! Although the relleno did not come with shrimp, as I'd had hoped, for a up charge they gladly did it for me!( and didn't give me a hard time about it!!) I've been returning for years and their vast menu leaves many options for vegetarians and vegans alike. Everything on the menu, from chips to salsa, to the delicious beans and enchilada sauces, tamales are made by hand, in-house by people whose names the servers know personally. When I further inquired about the various products served here, I was elated and amazed.. They only buy from  other local az family companies! I feel good knowing my money spent here does not go to some anonymous big corporation; but to a family business. I will always recommend this spot to anyone new to the valley or people who care what they put in their bodies and the community aspect of \"keeping it local\"",

Not since living in New Mexico have I had such fresh and fluffy sopapillas. Pass on the option to have them served with ice cream or sugar. Have them served plain and then drizzle them with honey. It's makes for a great dessert. Another highlight is Ajo Al's Southwestern ambiance, which provides for a nice, relaxed atmosphere. This is a great place for dinner with family or friends.",

The chips and salsa always test my self control learned tonight that I have no self control. Was shook when the main entree came out really good portions for the price. They also have amazing iced coffee if you can only order one thing on the menu you order the Mexican iced coffee. enchiladas slammed they also gave you hot salsa and mild salsa. Hit all the good points for a sit down style Mexican restaurant.",

As we entered we were greeted, seated quickly, and loaded up on tasty salsa and warm chips made in-house. Our server did an excellent job answering our menu questions.   On this visit I ordered the steak fajitas and my lunch companion ordered the chicken taco salad. We were pleasantly surprised by the large amount of food we received from the lunch menu.   The fajitas are made with freshly grilled onions and peppers. The fajitas are served sizzling hot with, corn or flour tortillas, pico, guacamole, and a side of rice and beans. The fajitas were so good, and even though it was a large serving I managed to eat it all. My lunch companion also said she really enjoyed her chicken taco salad.  Everything was absolutely delicious, fresh-tasting, and perfectly seasoned.   We will return!",

I thought it was impressive they were able to serve that much food the moment they opened.  The food was better than I had expected.  I'd put them somewhere above Garcias and Valley Luna but close to the same ballpark.    A few things set them back a couple stars.  I didn't hear back after sending my order, unable to get a total over the phone, no knives were given, and the chips were old and stale.",

My waitress Christina was not at all attentive. Stops by drops water glass at the table and walks off.  Comes back a bit later to take my order. It took a while for the food to come out and again, she drops it at the table and walks off.  It took a while because it must have been sitting in the window  because it had cooled off.  I let her know and they brought out a hot order.  Finished my meal without one beverage refill. The chips were stale but that's a known 50/50 with them. They store them in big bins and they age. Disappointing visit in all.  Sigh.",

The service started out good, and as the meal progressed went downhill rapidly..  our server checked on us right after the food was delivered, came back one more time to collect our loyalty card info and then we didn't see her for over 10 minutes. Finally tracked down the manager to get refills on our drinks and asked him to bring the bill.  The waitress finally checked back with us and asked if we were ready for the bill.  Obviously there was a lack of communication, and there was another table that was having problems with their order and was taking up the time of our waitress, though she never bothered to acknowledge us. My husband really enjoys this restaurant, but tonight the service was below average.  .Follow up.  As we were walking out the manager approached us and insisted on giving us a gift card.

    "text": "I have been going to Ajo Al's since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. It was my dad's absolutely favorite place, so we went there a lot. It was a nice place where you could dress up, be served well and enjoy wonderful food. It was incredible. It has been about a year since my last visit to this particular location. My husband and I visited tonight- here are some key highlights about our experience. 1. When we walked through the front door we were greeted by a kid who meandered up to the host podium in skinny jeans, vans, and an aqua tee. Moments later I learned he worked there, and that the uniform has changed to tee's with artwork on them. They look cool, but not for the caliber of the restaurant this was.  2. This kid pointed to a booth and said- \"There is a table right there for you.\" All while standing at the podium. Ummm, okay. Hello. Right where? Should I just walk around the restaurant and point to a table, and you holler yes when I find the right one? Do you want me to grab my menus from you too? How about you take us to the table and seat us. They even do that at Denny's, come on-being a host is not rocket science.  3. We were seated at a booth at the bar- this one he had pointed to. The restaurant was fairly empty and the bartender was on her break. They called her in from her smoke break to serve us- I didn't realize she was an employee at first. When we were walking up to the restaurant, she was sitting on the back patio smoking and watching videos/a show/something on her cell phone.  4. When she finally did come attend to us, she walked right up to our table, put her phone in her pocket, and asked us what we would like to drink. However, when she put her phone in her pocket, it continued to play whatever she was watching. Loudly. Instead of excusing herself and reaching in her pocket to turn it off- she kept talking to us, ignoring it- like it wasn't there/wasn't her. That makes for good customer service. 5. People here were sloppy. The most presentable people were the bus boy and the guy who delivered our food from the kitchen- and this man is the only respectable employee I saw the whole night.  6. Our salsa was watery. Salsa here used to be the BEST. We would fight over it and eagerly wait for refills. This time, our tomatoes stayed in one spot and the water/sauce ran all over our plates. Disappointing to say the least. 7. Portions were large like they have always been- at least that was consistent. 8. I ordered the Green- chili, chicken nachos that were entirely bland. My chicken was dry and flavorless, the jalapenos were dried out, and it surprisingly did not have a single green chili. Hmmm. No wonder it was so bland. I didn't bother complaining, as I assumed I would get just as great customer service as I already had. Little did I know- this bland food was to make me sick all night... food poisoning at it's finest. Funny- the last time my husband and I were here, he got food poisoning.  9. We were all set and waiting for the check. No one acknowledged us. I stacked our dishes and pushed them to the side of the table to make the table easier to bus. I hoped that would be a sign to them. Our waitress was still oblivious. The awesome employee- the kitchen guy- when he was delivering food, he had noticed us and returned to take our dishes and check on us. He then brought our check upon our request. If only we were tipping him instead of our waitress.  10. A man who had never addressed us picked up our check without a word.  11. We left and were not addressed at all. Kbye.   Needless to say, we will not be returning. We will also be passing this message on to our families and friends, to keep them from having such a lovely experience themselves.  Save your wallet, your time, your stomach, and your dignity, and FIND A DIFFERENT PLACE TO GO OUT TO EAT.",

The chips and salsa they serve you when you first sit down are average but I liked how they do give you two types of salsa right off the bat. No need to ask for a spicier one. I ordered the Poco Polla con Queso off the lunch menu. It came with rice and beans for $9.00. It was quite a lot of food for lunch and I ended up taking half of it home with me. I got the black beans and they were pretty good but a little bland. So was the rice. I had to salsa to both of them to give them a little more flavor. But the Poco Polla was excellent and I would go back again.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this restaurant for years, I like just about all of their food. I usually order Cheese enchiladas, and shredded beef tacos. Their cheese enchiladas are good but can be somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes not cooked enough, sometimes with not enough sauce, and even though they are supposed to have onions in them they rarely ever do.   Their shredded beef tacos are very good but they seem to have gotten shredded beef and machaca tacos mixed up. At most restaurants a machaca taco is very finely shredded spiced beef, and shredded beef tacos are coarsely shredded beef. Here if you order a machaca taco you get a course shredded beef in a preformed taco shell, and if you order shredded beef you get machaca in a properly deep fried taco shell. Whatever, I just order accordingly.   Red chile burros are very good. Cheese crisps are sometimes burned on the bottom. Chips are often very fresh and hot, but their hot sauce has WAY too much oregano in it. it's been consistent over the years but WAY WAY TOO MUCH oregano!  They make a MEAN Cadillac Margarita on the rocks.  My wife likes their seafood enchiladas, I can't vouch for them as I don't like seafood that much.   One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something with out rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.",

She wouldn't let it go and to be honest I was very skeptical because I live in Chicago and truly think we have some of the best Mexican food around. So I went a bit begrudgingly and ordered this chicken cheese thing she was raving about and oh. My. God. This may have been a slightly life changing experience. I'm not sure how truly authentic this dish is cause I've never seen it in Mexico or anywhere else for that matter but it doesn't even matter because it's THAT good. It's basically shredding chicken with white cheese in the center of a deep fried tortilla. They then pour more cheese over it- twice. The taste is unbelievable and worth all the indulgence. The guacamole was meh and the Margarita was one of the worst I've ever had BUT this chicken dish gives this review the 4 stars it deserves.",

This is a Mexican/American restaurant with a small bar inside.   Okay let me just start off with the menu, it was so busy for me lol.  There is too much going on in there.  Of course we were looking for alcohol beverages and sadly they don't have an alcohol beverage menu? We asked our waitress and all she said \"we have a full bar so any drink you want we can make\".  I just wanted any of their specialty drinks like any other restaurant would have. Their only specialty drinks were margaritas (figures lol). I ordered their blood orange margarita on the rocks and it was yummy.   For dinner I went with their enchiladas and surprisingly they were so good!!! I was expecting this place to be somewhat like mackayos or garcias but their food is more tastier than those places. Everyone we went with had great things to say about their dish.   For dessert we ordered a flan to split with my mother in law. And I am sorry but that was probably the worst flan i have ever had in my flan life. Don't order it flan enthusiast you will be HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.   Customer service was ok waitress was nice, but extremely slow. She seemed to have no kind of interest in taking our orders after we all stopped looking at our menus. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert before handing our bill. We waited about 15 min before she came back for the bill just for us to add more to our bill. It just wasn't very great service.",

    "text": "I did enjoy the atmosphere of this place. It seems clean and cozy. The margaritas were strong and tasty, though few flavors, if that's your thing. Service was friendly, though a bit slow and not top level attentive, which is fine. The menu was perhaps a bit limited, and the staff's knowledge of what items were actually vegetarian was a bit disappointing. I got a solid answer on the beans (their refried are not veg friendly - not surprising, but the black beans are, and the rice is made with chicken broth). To find out whether the tortillas were vegetarian, the packages with ingredient lists were brought out one at a time - the corn tortillas appear to be vegetarian but the flour tortillas answer is inconclusive, as they contain \"shortening\" which could of course be either animal or plant so I never got an answer on that one. The spinach enchiladas and guac were good. The cheese dip was ok but tasted like artificial cheese. The black beans tasted like beans do when they've been in the fridge for a few days too long and start to smell weird... So that was a bit concerning... And hopefully it was just a perception but the boyfriend did agree. Maybe this is what I get for asking so many questions about what is vegetarian friendly but I did feel that I was patient and friendly. So a mix of pros and cons and a non vegetarian would probably have a better experience, but overall not bad.",

We wanted a place people could meet and wish her a happy birthday.  They seated us in the room in the back that has one open side. This is the same place we had the wedding dinner. We had a great time and everyone enjoyed their food.; We have three grandsons and they had a great time running around as we were the only people on this patio.  The service was good and some came out to make sure we had everything we needed.  Everyone had a good time. This will be a place we will surely come to visit again especially when we get our family together.",

We ordered the Pollo con Queso, the mini chimi kids meal and a watermelon margarita. Now, maybe because I normally don't order alcohol when out, unless its a $3 beer, but $9 for a margarita seems darn costly. It was really good, but heck, for that price it better be! The Pollo was pretty good, a little dry, but nothing the pound of cheese and jalapeno cream cheese cant fix :)   The kids meal was fairly priced, at $5.50, for 3 mini chimis beans and a sprite. He seemed to like it. The waiter was nice, but only checked on us once, after most of our food was finished.   Would I come back, sure. But was I wowed, no.",
