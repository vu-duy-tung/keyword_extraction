    "text": "Been coming here for quite a while.  Went there on a Friday at 4:00 for the happy hour.  First thing I noticed was the remodel, which is nice, but in my opinion it totally ruined the \"charm\" of the restaurant.  Yeah it's nice, but now it looks like every other wannabe trendy sushi restaurant.  Second thing I noticed was the ridiculously loud top forty pop being played.  I couldn't hear the person across from me because Rihanna was blasting so loud!  It was surreal, I felt like I was at a weird club which happened to serve sushi.  The service has gone down as well.  My friend asked for a to-go container of the sauce she had and our server didn't know what she was talking about and came back with salad dressing.  I was getting so frustrated because I couldn't hear a damn thing, and how do you not know what sauce it was?  It was the only sauce that came with our meal.  I finally had to describe what dish we ordered and that we wanted the tempura dipping sauce.  She came back with the sauce and our bill; I wasn't done.  I wanted another beer and my friend wanted to order dessert.  I spent 90 bucks there and won't be back.  Such a shame, the food is alright, but it's such a frustrating dining experience now, just not worth it anymore.  If it's not broken (and it wasn't) then don't fix it.  I suppose they wanted to attract a younger and more \"hip\" crowd, but hello?!?!  The demographic of the area isn't that.  Perhaps it's working though, as we left I saw six half dressed twenty somethings walking in.  This place isn't Ra, and that's why I always liked it.  I hate giving bad reviews, but I spent a lot of money there for subpar food and loud crappy music.",

    "text": "I love love LOVE this place! They have so much to choose from its hard to decide on just a few items. My boyfriend and I have been there twice so far. On our first visit we happen to get there during happy hour. Needless to say it was BUSY! I know a lot of people hate to go to restaurants when they are packed but not this girl! To me, it says a lot about the food! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and started salavating as we picked out a few rolls. We decided on the Manhattan Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Soft Shrimp Hand Roll and one other that escapes me at the moment! Ha! Anyways, the Manhattan Roll was on point!!! Oh so good! The Soft Shell Crab Roll was amazing! Not fishy at all! I think my other half could have eaten a ton of those. The Las Vegas Roll was definitely different than you'd get at most sushi places. It had some sort of green sauce rather than the typical eel sauce. Because I am so use to the average Las Vegas roll, I was a bit taken back at first, but after each bite, I rather enjoyed it! Man I wish I could remember the other roll we had because it too was fantastic!  The second visit was not during happy hour. It was by far, not as busy. We sat at the bar as we usually do and was greated by Sean. This guy should be in comedy! He kept us entertained with his humor which was refreshing since most sushi chefs are so dang serious! On this day we ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Rose Royce Roll. I'm not even go into reviewing the Shrimp Tempura Roll. Don't get me wrong, it was delish! But I have to tell you about the Rose Royce Roll....can you say spicy? No.....spicy does no justice to this roll. Hot? Hmmm....no. Let's see...how about a nice subtle heat that turns into a punch in the throat like sneak attack from highly trained Ninjas! Yep that'll do! This roll was so delicious! Packed with fresh cut habenero, If you are a novice to hot food, you will never get through this roll! This thing had us both sweatin' to the oldies! But we loved it! Sean was gracious enough to let us try some jelly fish. The marinate was very tasty but the texture was like eating soft plastic. Very cartilage-y lol! The service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills since they were on top of that. We will definitely be back here. So far this is our \"sushi place of choice\".",

The sessame salad with their dressing was amazing! (Get anything with the salad and dressing)  I would give this a 4 star if only we had better service during the dinner. This is one of the slowest japanese place i ever had. I think it was mainly because of our server. The other servers were swift so i guess i cannot generalize the whole place with poor service. They have a lot of choices for their rolls so i still want to comeback and try the others!  So should you...  :P",

They have tons of paper signs advertising their hottest and newest creations... the sushi staff are friendly and the patrons usually are as well.  I had a \"bubba gump\"  special.... shrimp, wrapped with shrimp and more shrimp...with shrimp on top.  YUM!  The Caterpillar roll is as good as any i have ever had.  One bite of the Lobster Tempura roll, and i am hooked again.  The sweet lobster flavor sent my senses off on Mr Sushi addiction.  I'm writing this review at 9 am, because if i was writing it during their working hours... i would probably put my computer away, get in the car and have sushi for breakfast.  It was that good.  seriously.  Now that I think about it, I'm probably going there for lunch.",

Its tempura shrimp with cream cheese, scallions, a spicy mix I cant remember the name of, and then topped with yellow tail a slice of jalapeno, and sriracha sauce. Its soooo good. I know some people dont like cream cheese in there rolls I happen to like it a lot, but there are some of the best exotic rolls on the menu I have ever seen. Also I tried the jalapeno poppers to. Not your average poppper but realy good. They came with a smokey sauce and were good for $3.50. HH prices at lunch.  Check this place out! Killer bannana dessert!!!",

There are abundant of rolls ...enough to start their own sushi roll wiki and too many for my taste bud. I usually prefer sashimi. The fish quality is pretty good. Most of the dishes is not quite pricey and they have plenty of choices to go around that will feed everyone in the family including the kids.   Some of the rolls here is better than Zen 32 in Scottsdale, which is more $$$$.. Anyway it's a different enviroment that cater to different crowds.",

    "text": "So the place goes by a couple names, Its also known as Mr. Sushi. So when you are trying to find it, just look for the Marie Calendars, turn into that parking lot and then drive straight back to the little hidden strip mall area. The sign on the building says Akaihana, The sign on the window says Mr. Sushi....A bit confusing.   We got there at about 6pm last night. There were a few tables seated but it was pretty dead. We got seated right away and placed a drink order.   They have a pretty large menu and offer a TON of sushi. We placed our order and had everything in about 20 minute. Pretty fast.   Now, Like I said in my Roka Akor review...I am not a sushi girl, AT ALL. So I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner. It was tasty. I did sneak a couple pieces of sushi to see if I liked it.   The soft shell crab roll was gross. I was not a fan, it had a real fishy flavor to it. ACK!   On the other hand, the tempura fried shrimp roll was YUMMO!   I did not eat the other stuff, there was a spicy tuna roll and some other something that the hubs ordered.   By the time we left (8pm) the place had filled up. It looked like there was only one waitress, but she was running her ass off and doing a good job at keeping everyone happy.   I would go back here if someone said they wanted to go, but its not on my list of must go to places.   Give it a try.",

It isn't horrible.  But it is certainly the Denny's of sushi joints.  Service was friendly.  Sesame seaweed was a perk because no one seems to serve it anymore.  Veggie tempura was dripping grease.  And.  There are five thousand different sushi rolls that all sound and taste the same!  We had soft shell crab roll, shrimp with eel, and spicy tuna with cilantro.  The cilantro was a GREAT addition, but the tuna was fishy and strangely colored.  Soft shell crab wasn't terrible, shrimp and eel was really fishy.  I do not believe the Rolls were rolled correctly as they just fell apart. I'm sorry, but I was unimpressed, and we won't be returning.  Again, super friendly people, and neighborhood joint atmosphere cannot make up for food, in my opinion.",

Came in during happy hour and had a spicy salmon roll, seaweed salad, soft shell crab and shumai. The roll was made out of rice that was overcooked and the pieces all fell apart. Seaweed salad and shumai were nothing special. The soft shell crab was a tiny piece of crab for $6. It was the best thing I had among everything I ordered, but I wish they added a little more breading. Over all, this place just isn't for me. Service wasn't great, my water was never refilled and I felt like I was bothering my server.   I do know a couple of people who frequent this place and swear that this is the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona. I would still recommend you to try it; maybe I just came at the wrong time.",

    "text": "Overall, this is a decent place for inexpensive Japanese food, but you'll have to endure questionable service and a landmine of unsavory rolls on the menu on your way to a satisfying dinner. Also, show up early. If you wanna eat at 9, be there before 8. It gets PACKED. They close at 10.   I arrived around 8:30 and was understandably told to wait. At about 9 I was seated, and we ordered appetizers. The entire time, I was gawking at the menu like \"OMG I can order like 3 different things this is so cheap\". I ordered the terriyaki chicken as an app. It was freaking delicious, and came out in less than 10 minutes. My dining companion and I ordered 3 rolls between us. They are, on average, about $7 each for some decent stuff.   Only problem is that it took a bit over half an hour to arrive! WTF?   The hana roll was beautiful and tasty, with the multiple varieties of fish. Unfortunately, they fell apart rather easily, even for something so large it was cumbersome to enjoy with chopsticks. I still approve. The tootsie roll was not exactly what I was expecting. Didn't realize that all the contents would be cooked, and thought it was weird that there were tempura batter bits mixed throughout the rice. As for the tropicana roll, mango and salmon sounded lovely, but I didn't realize there would be excessive globs of mayonnaise on top of it.   I feel as though the menu does not accurately describe what you're signing up for, and that can result in disappointment.   In the end, I barely had time to take a couple of bites before a server dropped off a check. They were adamant about getting us out ASAP despite being patient with them. It's hard to knock a sushi place that's offering such great deals, but it really pushes my limits of how much questionable service I can put up with before I ding you. I really want to drop this to a 3, but I just can't. You were too easy on my wallet.",

They also hired a lot more servers although still as busy so service depends on when you dine. Most importantly, the taste of both their sushi rolls and ala carte specials such as yakisoba and baby squid salad changed. Went back couple of times to make sure but I can no longer reccommend their rolls as the go to sushi even their famous las vegas roll. There just wasnt enough taste for the price. As for their yakisoba, there was a lot less ingredients than before - might as well boil plain noodle with food dye and sprinkle a packet of microwaveable vegetables....yes it was that bare. As for my old favorite baby squid..Taste was spicier and definitely saltier although they did try to mask the difference by adding more fried squid... So disappointed....",

The remodeled so there is twice the seating that was there before and they added a bar.  I gladly drive from Mesa up to Phoenix just to have Sushi there.  It's worth the drive and the prices during happy hour are the best of any place I have been too.  Yes, its a 5 star rating, It's always been top quality.",

The food is not good, fish is not fresh or of a high quality, rice is not properly cooked and if you get anything out of the deep fryer (tempura, etc.) you can taste their nasty, dirty cooking oil. They serve ranch dressing with the salad that comes with entrees. Ranch?? At a \"Japanese\" restaurant?? If you order chicken katsu, as I unfortunately have, it comes out looking like a child cut it up. Service is S-L-O-W!  We've been here twice and never again.",

I nirmally go here on saturdays for lunch and love it.I am no expert, but I am sure employees are not supposed to write don credit card numbers and keep that information when the pay system is down. There's a thing called offline payment processing for this exact scenario. So I walked in this weekend and there was a couple there that looked upset and were talking to the two girls up front. I sat there being ignored for at least 5 minutes while they both talked to the couple. The boyfriend reluctantly wrote his credit card info for the employees since the card system was down. The girlfriend was angry and did not think that was right. After I saw all this happen one girl finally turned around and saw me waiting right there. She asked if I was helped yet and I said no I have been patiently waiting right here this whole time. She then proceeded to try and seat me right away without even bothering to tell me about their system being down. I stopped her and said, wait, I understand your pay system is down? She just smiled nervously and said \"Yes, but we can just write your card number down for later\" I said \"Nope, uhuh, I am leaving, bye\". This sounds SUPER SHADY and sounds like a PCI compliance violation to me......",

Tried a tuna thing, spicy scallop roll, California roll (the crunchy one) and the dragon roll. Omg, it was all so good.  The place was full when we arrived, so is clearly popular. The already good prices are even better during happy hour, so more fish on your dish!  The staff seemed nice enough, if a bit spacey, but the food came out quickly and tasted just delicious.   Have I managed to convey that the sushi here is really good? They may do other stuff...but I have no idea. The sushi is what you need to get here :)  Nom.",

    "text": "Did I eat at the correct Akaihana? Because based off the reviews, it seems like I had a completely different experience here that was hardly passable in my book.  Akaihana advertised a happy hour and had deals for apps, sushi rolls and alcohol, plus it was cheap, but I guess some things are too good to be True. I stepped into Akaihana and was greeted by the sushi chef in some kind of indistinct Asian language, I'm used to the \"Irasshaimase\" greeting as I used to serve at a Japanese restaurant in the past. However, I could not make out what language he was speaking. Regardless, I was seated in the corner of the restaurant and was given 3 menus.  Since I was sharing dinner, the items that were ordered were: Tootsie Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Tropicana Roll  -Tootsie Roll: deep fried salmon surrounding imitation crab meat, big roll and served with a soy-based sauce -Spicy Salmon Roll: chopped up salmon mixed with spicy sauce in a roll, this is nothing special. Spicy salmon does not work in my book, spicy tuna does though.  - Tropicana Roll: Salmon with mango, each piece topped with spicy mayo and sriracha and more soy-based sauce  This place masks the quality of their fish with sauces, deep frying and rice portion. The portion of rice was overwhelming in comparison to the rest of the fish in the rolls and wasn't seasoned well and hard, the sauces overtake your tastebuds not allowing you to taste the fish. The ginger was very sweet and I didn't even dare try the wasabi.  Cheap prices are reflected in their quality of rolls,: over sauced, too much rice and lacking in quality of fish. Interior is a bit crazy with variety of menu choices and service is decent at most. Also upon leaving, the sushi chef greeted me once again in some indistinct (made up sounding) language which I found to be a bit offensive. Because I know for a fact he was not speaking Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or Filipino because I've worked and frequent Japanese and Korean restaurants/have friends who are and that I am both Vietnamese and Filipino.  *Pass on this place, I got a stomach ache the whole night after dining in here.",

My only complaint is that at the bar, we were not sure who was waiting on us.  We needed drink refills and to order more food and no one asked us if we needed anything once we got our initial order.  We had to stop the very busy sushi makers to ask for more drinks, more food, etc  ... and I figure if we are spending full dinner prices (our bill was  over $50.00), we should be asked, often, if we are ok and do we need anything.

I will definitely be returning.  Regarding the reviewer who said there are no descriptions of the food, one of the things they handed me was a complete description of the rolls I was ordering, so I'm not sure where they're getting that. For 48 dollars I got quite a lot of very yummy food for me and my wife, and we have more than enough for leftovers tomorrow.",

Lobster Tempura Roll: good sized pieces of lobster. The whole thing is deep fried. Perhaps not your thing  Spicy Yellowtail Roll: a subtle sweetness to it. Definitely worth an order  N*Joy",

They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights.

My lady would like to add that the temperature here was pleasant as opposed to the subzero temperatures that is usually coupled with sushi bars.  We got the Paul (Our Favorite), Crazy (also good), Crunch, Godzilla, and Las Vegas(wasn't a huge fan of) rolls.  The rolls were decently priced, the only regret we have is trying to eat 5 rolls (due to our ignorance of the portion size).  Over all, it is agreed among the  three of us that it was a pleasant experience and we would come back.",

Me, my bf, and his friend came during happy hour today around 5:25pm and no one came to take our drink order, but the hostess noticed it had been about 5 minutes and she did offer to get our drinks. However, oddly, the green tea was quite watered down. We mentioned so and were brough fresh green teas, which were much better. When our server took our order, he was definitely in a hurry. He never brought us plates, accidentally put our sriracha sauce at the table behind us, and actually set his tray down on our table with our soups and teriyaki chicken, and walked away for us to serve ourselves. A different server gal noticed and came to retrieve the tray.  As for the rolls, tasty as usual. We shared the Tootsie roll (cooked salmon and crab), Kodiak roll (cooked salmon and avocado), fried California roll, and Blue Flame roll (crab salad and crab stick with avocado, deep fried). They were all very good, but the deep fried rolls were a little over cooked.  This is the first time we've had an experience this much less stellar than other visits, but overall, we still had a tasty dinner, and for 4 rolls, 2 green teas, 3 miso soups, 1 rice, squid salad, and chicken teriyaki (one of the best!), the total was $38. Can't really complain there.  We'll definitely be back again soon, maybe a little earlier next time.",

We live a lot further away now but still make it a point to get take out from our favorite sushi place!  It is also the only Sushi place in our area that we know of that makes all your rolls with amazingly light and totally perfect brown rice if you ask them!   And their Japanese Dynamite Salad is out of this world!!  The prices are very reasonable too!  This place does have one drawback however. Whenever we eat in, service tends to be quite slow - often times painfully slow, even though always very friendly! I don't think we've ever been quickly in and out and always had to wait quite a long time for our order to make it to the table.  We generally call ahead with a take out order and just pick it up though, as that works better for us anyway, so it's not much of a problem for us.   But as a dining in experience it might be a little more challenging!",

I was greeted as soon as I walked in and taken to a nice table. I was then given three different menus of which I looked over and over because there were so many options. I finally decided on the Lunch Box Special ($8) the sushi appetizer ($6) and the Tropicana Roll ($5) They first brought out the miso soup included in the bento, which was good, with tofu, seaweed, and some green onions. Shortly after, my sushi appetizer followed. Just looking at the appetizer I knew that it was good quality. Each bite confirmed this. The appetizer was one piece shrimp, one piece white fish, one piece tuna, and one piece salmon. All were amazing and melted in mouth. Then the Tropicana roll arrived. Wow. I almost didn't want to touch the plate because of the beautiful display that was sitting in front of me. Salmon and mango inside the roll and was served with sweet mayo which was REALLY good. It also comes with siracha but I requested it without. I didn't think that mango in a roll would make a lot of sense but it was amazing. Then my bento came. A little bit of chicken teriyaki in good sauce, various veggies and one shrimp tempura which were all done nicely, There was a nice big bowl of rice, There was also a nice salad, and a California roll. The CA roll was a bit meh but the rest was pretty good. I was stuffed... most likely will just the sushi appetizer and a couple rolls.",

    "text": "\"I thought I'd already written a review for this place.\" If I had a maki for every time I said that, I'd really be rolling.  \"Mr. Sushi\" formerly, and I'm talking at least ten years ago, but this name \"Akaihana\" was attached as well if I remember correctly. They have dropped the former, but the quality has thankfully stayed the same.   Four stars for sure, but I surrender the fifth for an exceptional treat on this past Christmas Eve. Running late to a late supper in Paradise Valley, we wanted to sneak in a bite and seeing as this place closes at 2pm; I called en route at about 1:45 and placed and order, but I requested that, instead of \"to go,\" that it merely be ready for our arrival (probably right around 2pm.) They obliged.   We walked in, were seated promptly and much to the other diner's surprise....several rolls, bowls of miso soup and a seaweed salad were promptly brought to our table. It couldn't have been timed more perfectly. It couldn't have tasted more delicious.   I've found a wonderful trio of rolls is: the Las Vegas, (note: the cilantro/jalapeno aioli that comes with this roll also compliments a filet mignon rather nicely, as I found out on a more recent to-go order!), Spicy Scallop roll and the Alexa Go Go roll.  Top it off with miso soup and a seaweed salad and it's a nice taste selection for two. Add \"Forrest Gump\" for your shrimp fix and \"Marc Roll\"gives your tastebuds a River Eel dance.  Notes:  - They close between lunch and dinner.  - They have A LOT of rolls - see menus, the walls for papers with handwritten descriptions as well as the special boards, outside usually as well as the chalkboard behind the sushi chefs - The strip mall here is totally deserted! Don't let that dissuade you. You can access via Black Canyon Hwy (which is frontage road I-17) or from Northern or 24th Avenue) - It's not a fancy interior but it has character - Service can be slow but always friendly",

The happy hour is great, you can choose different ones at the same time (some of them have 5 rolls each). The staff are really friendly and attentive. I really didn't like the beverages, even regular water.",

Shrimp puffs were good, never had a shrimp puff only have had crab puffs but I'm happy I tried something new. Darling roll is super super good. Best part of my meal. Also got the Philadelphia roll, lobster tempura and the blue flame roll. I would never get the lobster tempura again, I just did not enjoy the taste. Blue flame & Philadelphia were both fine nothing to write home about. I would try different rolls next time but for sure get the darling roll again. Got the cheesecake tempura for dessert, good but I was so over fried food that I didn't really enjoy it too much. Would skip next time. Service was fine, refilled our drinks whenever needed & was kind. I will for sure return & bring others! :)",

I opted to try spicy tuna hand roll, salmon skin hand roll, salmon puffs (a bit over done), Akaihana Roll (tootsie roll, deep fried), Blue flame roll, & Salmon Kama (collar).  There are not that many places that offer Salmon Kama here in AZ.  This was prepared perfectly with still a lot of tender & moist meat.  Everything I tried was good and off of the happy hour menu.  The place is a good size restaurant with sushi bar seating too.  The server was good and the had the food out in a rather quick fashion, which is nice.  Will definitely come back...especially for happy hour!",

Service wasn't crazy fast, but not as stupid long as Sushi Kee in Tempe. (You should avoid Sushi Kee Tempe at all costs. You have been warned.)  But oh my god, when the rolls came out.. they were GENEROUS with the fish, and the rolls were BIG.  Would I come back to Akai Hana with Mido Sushi just around the corner? ...I might. It's definitely in the realm of possibility.  If you are in the area and can make Akai Hana's reverse happy hour (8pm onwards) - I URGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT.

Our sushi chef, Jack, was quiet, but amicably responded to any of our questions after he announced each of our rolls as they were ready. He even gave a free sample of sashimi!   My friend's favorite roll was the Tootsie Roll because of the crunch and sweet sauce.  My favorite was the Butter Me Up ... Garlic butter with a hint of wasabi topped with seared salmon!   I also enjoy the remodeled open concept space.    I will definitely be back!  Side Note: \"Who Says\" by Selena Gomez played in the background ... Her music is one of my guilty pleasures.:)",

Tempura with no tempura sauce, and it tasted old.  Waitress dropped an entire tray of ice water on my mom and didn't even apologize.  The best part was the table behind us with young children screaming... while the parentals were sake bombing like 18 year olds.  Clearly... a classy place if you ask me.

I looked to it as a hidden sushi island .. hidden away from the world for me to discover... So I discovered.. and here is my report..  O.k. happy hour.. A couple of names Mr Sushi or Akaihana which I think means \"red flower\". Reading other peoples reviews going back I guess it has had a few names? ..  Anyway ..Its a good lunch and quick drink place. not much else I am pretty certain of.  I have eaten here twice now and I am glad I did before reviewing it. tonight's subsequent visit has served as a more complete look at the place.  The first time I ate there I ended up sitting next to the owner by total coincidence. It was he who guided me to the specialty hand rolls. I had the lobster the butter me up and a few others that he recommended. I would give that experience 4 stars.  This time however... unfortunately for me was not quite the experience of the previous one :{ The happy hour was crowded Tonight so it took a while to get any service.. I sat there for a good 10 min before getting my beer. Whatever it was busy..but I had to wait 5 min for them to even look at me when I walked in the door. Sorta annoying..  The fish was not that fresh and I guess I would expect it to be on a Friday? I had just a simple dragon roll and the thing fell apart trying to eat it. The squid salad was o.k... All for about 20$ with a sake bomber The experience was a 2 star one..  I gotta give them credit that some of the special rolls are pretty tasty. The rest was just average .. and the service this time was pretty painful.  Everyone I have ever talked to in the place has told me it was their favorite..There seems to be good local following... and the place was packed for the new happy hour, so maybe I just got the \"raw\" end of the deal this time?..  You will want this place to go if your in the neighborhood and certainly go to it for the rolls to at least try em,, but my Yelp app will be primed for a new place the next time I am on the west side.",

The place was busy, but the service was still descent.  We ordered two salmon-based rolls (Philadelphia and Las Vegas rolls) and the teriyaki chicken dinner (which was pretty big portion of chicken and a heaping serving of salad).  Great tasting food!  We'll be back soon!",

There were a few items that were not included but believe me, it was only a few. The place was packed as they had been offering this deal all day. It only happens a few times a year, usually around the holidays so you have to be in the know as its not advertised unless you of course frequent this place on a regular. A friend of a friend is a regular customer there so she not only knew all about it, but she even has a roll named after her and they know her by name. (Try the Karen on the menu, its  very good)   It took awhile for our rolls to come out as again it was packed and there were only 3 sushi chef working, but once they started rolling out it was all hands on deck. I don't even remember what I ordered anymore because I was greedy and had way more than I should have. (It was all you can eat you know)  But I do know that the rolls were huge and here were plenty of them. If you check out there menu online its only a small snapshot of the actual sushi menu as its pretty extensive. I will be back to check out their happy hour in the near future.",

Food came out way quicker than I thought it would and was not too shabby, perhaps a little pricey for what we got but not that big of a deterrent. The Mexican Roll is a slice of Hell in your mouth (not necessarily a bad thing) and honestly, their Baked Scallop/Dynamite/'whatever it's called in your neck of the woods' Roll is the best one I've EVER had. Very generous with the scallops and surimi and the roll still didn't disintegrate under the weight of the baked goodness. The GF wasn't a fan but we will try it again for happy hour, minus the large group.",

The pricing is some of the most reasonable throughout the valley & it is paired with a great happy hour menu that is available 7 days a week, several times a day. The sushi special is great for lunch or dinner & will fill you up until your next meal. The specialty rolls are some of the best I've ever tasted. Great sushi is popping up all over the United States...some most notoriously are found in Las Vegas or Los Angeles - however, nothing can compare in quality or value, to this amazing little place in Phoenix, formerly known as Mr. Sushi - now recognized at Akaihana Sushi & Grill.",

The staff caters to your every need and are as friendly as could be, the patrons that hangout here are equally as friendly. Overall the best experience Ive had in a while, though my heart will always be with Sakana (Ahwatukee).",

    "text": "Okay Akai Hana or Mr. Sushi? Who gives a crap what the name is, it's not going to stop me from tyring a place because of the name. First thing you should know they have HH EVERYDAY from 4-6pm...om the weekends 3-6. My friend and I checked it out a few months back on a Saturday to see what this place was all about. It was day time, in a strip mall..large windows so I don't know how it could possibly be considered dark if you went in the daytime. Its not a fancy place, it's not a RA or Kyoto..so if you want atmosphere and pretentiousness, yes by all means stay away. For the sushi however...they have the most unique rolls I have encountered thus far in AZ.   ex:  MEXICAN -   Tuna, cucumber and habanero,topped with masago  AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK- Mackerel, tuna,tasmanian abalone, avocado with mango sauce  BUTTER ME UP  -Tuna tempura, avocado,seared salmon, topped with garlic wasabi butter  TODD (Volcano) 15.00  Baked spicy tuna, cucumber,avocado, with shredded crabstick, sits on top of orange,with special sauce and lit on fire   I kid you not.. they have some crazy rolls and we ordered 4.. which included the Butter Me Up listed above. The presentation was phenomenal and so was the food.  We did not experience screaming kids or squeaking fans?? Anyway I was so excited by this find that I sent my boss there and he LOVES sushi. It was him, his wife and their 3 kids (who are very well behaved i might ad). They went for the HH and they loved it. They walked out of there spending less than $50 for the 5 of them..That's numerous appetizers and rolls.  Seriously you can't beat this place for unique rolls and prices. Who cares where it is or what it's name is. This place was freakin fantastic .",

I come here when I want something dependable in the central Phoenix area without driving clear out to Scottsdale.  The fish here for the most part is fresh - nothing too creative here, and the interior isn't much to crow about either.   I find the sushi here to be better than Zen 32 (and cheaper), but not quite at the caliber of other standout places in town.  P.S.  I find the name a little peculiar.  Mr. Sushi??  I would normally scoff at a place called Senor Taco, Ms. Pasta or Madame Hot Dog.  But for some reason I'm ok with the cheesy name.",

I recommend the sushi lunch special which is fresh and has a nice sampling of sushi with a wonderfully unique spicy salmon hand roll. Or the sashimi lunch special if you're avoiding the rice! If you're not into Sushi they serve a great teriyaki chicken special with a California roll, soup and a huge salad for only 6.95! All in all this is a great stop when you're craving fresh sushi at a great price! We will definitely return! Eat well, live well and enjoy!",

Although most Sushi came in a soy sauce bath which I could have done without. But Sushi was fresh yummy and served promptly. I see reviews mentioning appetizers but I do not see any appetizers mentioned on the menu. Wait staff did not offer refills on soda and we're not really involved with customers. The people who are making sushi delivered sushi but I was sitting at the bar so that may be different at a table. Not sure if I would return with a moderate prices and imitation crab . I did ask about price difference with adding real crab and it was around $6 per roll which is expensive compared to other places.",

Not once did anyone come back to take the order, refill drinks etc. Phone was ringing off the hook with no one answering. We will definitely eat here again but might just get food to go. I've worked in the F&B industry for years so I understand how crazy things can get but they definitely need a manager, hostess and maybe a busser or two to help with the dinner rush.

Ok let's get one thing straight -- prices are competitive, and portions are larger than mouth for most of the rolls.  The off-the-menu options are amazing. My favorites range from Caterpillar that is very, very avocado-y in a wonderful, cooling, scrumptious way, Viva Eyda (spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, lemon and sriracha sauce), Letty in Love (similar to Viva Eyda but instead of shrimp, you have fried crap throughout the roll and it's settled in ponzu sauce (garlicky), Mistake (combination of warm and raw fish -- pretty sure it's a mixture of spicy tuna, salmon, and roe) and veggie roll.  This is one of the very few places that does a Las Vegas in an entirely different manner (think deep fried, topped with jalepenos and then settled in ponzu sauce), but it's worth the try! My boyfriend is a fan of the blue flame (deep fried crab and cream cheese roll with a generous drizzle of eel sauce and spicy mayo sauce).  I'm constantly bringing those close to me here because I truly believe you get the best buys here and the best cuts of fish. Some nights are super busy, so be aware that this joint is smaller and wait times may be longer. Just know you will definitely not regret the food portions here!",

I am a vegan but they have so many choices- I have ordered the cucumber avocado roll, cucumber roll and my favorite is the kampyo roll made with sweet gourd. My boyfriends favorites have been the blue flame roll, tootsie roll, and the fried California roll. We love the food and the prices and we will continue to come back!! I definitely would recommend giving this place a try!",

The new name is difficult to pronounce and even harder to remember. I used to love the Mr. Sushi name- so easy to remember!  Regardless of the name, the place has the same feel and if think the same menu too.   For a reasonable price, you get generous portions of whatever it is that you've ordered. It's a guarantee that you will not leave hungry coming here for lunch or dinner.   I am glad the atmosphere of this place has stayed the same. Warm, friendly and inviting. It's like greeting an old friend when I walk through the doors after not being here for awhile.   Regardless of how many name reincarnations this place goes through, I hope they don't change the atmosphere of the restaurant and this place will always be Mr.  Sushi to me!",

    "text": "It's possible that this may be the worst sushi restaurant i've ever eaten at.  Let's start with service.   -We were seated about five minutes after arrival. That would be ok if there wasn't open tables but there were. There was a period of time where the hostess was no where to be found. The actual waitress started off ok but was very slow after the initial meet and greet.    The food  - Sushi is one of those things that really really needs to be fresh. Unfortunately the suhi here was just no where near fresh.  It had a very fishy smell and taste. It's hard to put my finger on it...but it was aweful.  -Almost every roll immediately fell apart when you picked it up.  A good roll keeps its shape with reasonable movement while being lifted from plate to mouth.    -My friend's wife who I was eating with found a sizable piece of tin foil in one of the rolls.  It was at that point that we all pretty much stopped eating our food.  We were given that roll free and the restaurant apologized. But honestly, I feel like the whole meal should have been free after that.   In conclusion this was simply a terrible experience in all ways.  Does it mean this place is always bad? Judging from the fact that there are many 5 star reviews I have to be fair and admit that it's possible we just caught it having a bad night.  Everybody makes mistakes. So maybe this place isn't as bad as our experience. But we will never go hear again.",

For instance, who else would have thought that fresh tomato could make a delightfully fresh and tasty roll (the Summer Tomato Roll, to be specific)? But it makes sense, as tomato is one of the best natural sources of glutamate, the umami element. The other rolls we had were equally satisfying.

My friends were able to get the Bento box and sushi special for under $10 each.  My main dishes or the spicy tuna roll, the blue flame roll, and the salmon skin roll.  Best roll was the blue flame roll. It is very reminiscent of a Las Vegas roll but without the cream cheese. It is not spicy at all despite the warnings. Very heavy roll due to it being fried 3.5/5  Spicy tuna roll is not spicy at all. The fish quality is not very high either. Very forgettable. 3/5  The worst roll is the salmon skin roll. I have ordered this dish from other restaurants before but this is the worst iteration I have ever tasted. The salmon is over cooked, and honestly reminds me of salmon from a can. You can't taste any crispy salmon skin. Unedible. Normally I don't waste food but I could not eat more than one piece. 1/5.",

We love the spicy tuna rolls on the happy hour menu. If you want some extra heat ask for them to add jalapeno or even habanero if you're brave! My personal favorite roll is the Rose Royce. This is very hot (it has habanero)! The roll has this incredible umami flavor though if you can take the heat! It includes a spicy tuna roll with habanero, topped with avocado, raw salmon, a lemon wedge (the best part) and sriracha. We never leave there without it. Other items that I highly recommend are: the cucumber salad, the gyozas, Kanpai Carpaccio #1, and the fried spicy chicken appetizer.",

    "text": "Checked this place out because of the reviews and since it was so close to my hotel.   Overall, it was pretty good.  One order of salmon sashimi yielded 5 smallish princes of salmon - fresh but small for $10.  One order of unagi nigiri (2 pieces) came out soaked in eel sauce - way too much sauce. As others have mentioned the sushi rice was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Lastly, I ordered the nabeyaki udon which came out very hot and was very tasty. The noodles were the perfect chewy texture and the pieces of chicken were really yummy. The only complaint I have is that when I got down to the last bit of broth, I bit down on a few small bits of eggshell which made it a not so great experience...but I got down to the bottom of the bowl, so I guess I enjoyed everything else in the pot!   If I'm back in this area, I may come back to try some of their unique rolls.",

One Sunday my g/f did a search on her phone for Sunday happy hours,  first on the google list was this place from 3-6 and 8-9 on Sundays they have a great sushi happy hour.    Don't let your first impressions fool you, it's not in a great neighborhood (and by that I mean its not 'bad', just not great).   They seem to be the only surviving place in the strip mall just about Northern on I17.   I usually won't go to a new sushi place on a Sunday because of the freshness of the fish etc... but it turned out to be a great place and fantastic food and the price was a SUPERB DEAL!  We went in, place only had about 12 people in it at that time.  Staff were very friendly, polite, quick to bring menus, drinks etc.   We ordered Edamame, calamari, and 6 rolls.   We are still not sure why we ordered 6, but the prices were so low we assumed they would be smaller portions like you get at other happy hours.  WRONG  We had so much food we ended up setting up a buffet on the next table!   Apart from the Tropicana roll, which had some weird apricot gel on it... everything was seriously good!  Vegas roll, California, spicy tuna, caterpillar, spicy salmon & Tropicana+ 2 ice teas and 2 appetizers, under $40.     Great find.  We were going to go again but we missed the happy hour deadline.",

They turn some of the rolls into little character (such as the caterpillar roll).   My favorite thing about this place is that they are not cheap when rolling their rolls! They come packed with fish and goodies and are a more than average size, which is GREAT for the already cheap price you pay and, of course, for your belly!   You can never leave this place hungry!

I'm from Japan so I know real good sushi and tend to look for that quality. I also know in Phoenix, it's hard to find 'fresh' fish. But still this place is a total disappointment.  First, it seems like they forgot to season sushi rice. Totally no taste at all which is very odd. For rolls with lots of other stuff and sauce, it could be acceptable but for nigiri with raw fish, it tasted weird. The fish was not fresh at all and we started worrying about getting food poisoning.  Second, we ordered takoyaki (octopus balls) which were deep fried. Takoyaki is a very famous and popular local food in Osaka (where I'm from) so I know what real takoyaki is. I've never seen deep fried takoyaki but can accept it if it's good but they were too oily.  And the service was below average too. The waitress did not repeat our order and she forgot one of the items we ordered.. The appetizer came fast but after that we waited 20-30mins. They were friendly, though.   They seem to have many kinds of rolls so if you like rolls and they don't forget to season the rice or you don't mind plain rice, you still could enjoy this place. But the overall quality of the food is low especially compared with other Japanese restaurants like Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe, Shimogamo, etc.  I don't see any point to go back to this restaurant.",

The happy hour menu is excellent and gives you a wide variety of things to order, from Miso Soup or Cucumber Salad for appetizer to sushi and even Saki.  You definitely can fill up on tons of Akaihana goodness on a small budget when you go during happy hour. They make delicious Jalapeno Poppers and I order them every time I'm there. My roll favorites are Tootsi and Rainbow.  The bar area is relatively small, but the table area is definitely spacious. Servers are always friendly and I have had consistently good service there.",

Gyoza and spicy chicken were the saving grace for me and the family. I will definitely come back just for the spicy chicken.  Teriyaki was nothing special. The ramen, which supposed to have pork and veggies but I only found 2 thin pieces of pork. The worst part was that the broth was barely warm and lacked flavor.   The salmon skin roll was ok. It was falling apart! The baked scallop roll was just mostly imitation crab with mayo and some scallops. The baked scallop roll took about 15-20 mins before we got it.  Anyway, the service was ok, the food was so disappointing especially for the price.",

    "text": "After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.  We rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.  We sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.  I ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.  As the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.  Those who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of \"scene.\"  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!",

I noticed they are expanding again and they're adding outdoor seating, just in time for pleasant Arizona weather.  My co-workers always get the Blue Flame.  I always get the garlic edamame for starters which is served warm. The lunch combinations are great and so are the lunch box items.  They have an extensive happy hour lunch sushi roll menu also.  You can get out of there for $10 or less for lunch and be satisfied.  My friend was celebrating her birthday so she got a free bowl of green tea icecream complete with candle. A very special unique thing is that they let her choose a set of fancy chop sticks to keep as a gift.  You can do lunch in under an hour here, so I would recommend it!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Akaihana, but unfortunately the food is mediocre at best and the service, while friendly, seemed disorganized. I did like that there is a private parking lot with plenty of spaces outside and that the interior was neat and clean.   I came with a party of two for lunch on a weekend, and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were offered a small table for two while other two-people parties were offered larger tables. I didn't mind this at first, but after our dishes came and the table would no longer fit all the plates (the waitress almost knocked a plate off because of how small the table was), we were still not offered a larger table even though there was a four-person one right next to us and the restaurant was still mostly empty. Our waitress was very friendly, so I believe it was more a lack of awareness than ill intent, but it did make the experience less enjoyable. She also accidentally brought us regular coke instead of diet coke and mistakenly added an item we did not order onto the bill while failing to charge us for another item.   Happy hour prices are super worth it for some dishes, but really not for others. We tried three happy hour dishes: fried octopus, fried soft-shell shrimp, and cooked salmon and avocado roll. Out of the three, I would really recommend the cooked salmon and avocado roll because it was a good size, cooked well, and worth the happy hour price. The fried octopus and soft-shell shrimp were less worth the happy hour price, and I definitely wouldn't recommend them normally priced.   Fried octopus: The fried octopus appetizer was very heavily coated in batter and over-fried so that the octopus was very rubbery. I appreciate that this restaurant offers baby octopus, but I had a hard time finishing the dish despite the fact that there were only five little octopi. There was a side salad on the bottom, and I nibbled at some to cut the greasiness of the fried octopus.   Cooked salmon and avocado roll: Like I mentioned above, I was a fan of this roll, especially for the happy hour price. This might be the only roll I would come back for out of all the dishes we ordered. I thought the salmon was nicely cooked, the pairing with avocado was classic, and the roll was flavorful without being smothered in sauce.   Fried soft-shell shrimp: These shrimp were fried in oil that was too hot so that the meat stuck to the shells. It was a good coincidence that the shells were soft and thus could be eaten, otherwise it would've been nearly impossible to peel off the shrimp from the shell. For the price of these, I thought three shrimp skewers was a small portion.   Nadeshiko roll: This roll was on the colored menu, but not on the paper one where orders are marked. I thought that this roll sounded amazing on paper, but in reality it was a textureless glob that really wasn't worth it. The spicy tuna on the inside was so minced that it was like baby food, although it did pack a nice punch of spiciness in flavor. The salmon on top was unevenly seared, and with the soft salmon and soft spicy tuna inside, each bite was a gloopy, soft puddle that I wasn't a fan of.  Arizona Cardinals roll: Another roll that sounded amazing on paper, I think that this roll would've been tasty if the components had been executed properly. Similarly to the octopus and soft-shell shrimp, the soft-shell crab in this roll was over-battered and over-fried. This made the crab completely lose its flavor and become very dry, which wasn't alleviated by the tuna on top because it's a rather lean fish. I did think that the tuna was fresh, but I was confused by the soy-based sauce that came with this roll. It was bland and nondescript, and I much preferred regular wasabi and soy sauce to it for the roll.  I think it's unlikely that I'll be back a second time, but perhaps if I'm in the area I'd take that cooked salmon and avocado roll (at happy hour price) to go..",

    "text": "This hidden gem is worth the find. Located just off the I17 in the nearly-deserted strip mall on the northeast side, Akaihana sushi & grill used to be a different name. The signs are still up for the old name but Akaihana is painted on too.  Nice place with tinted windows to block the direct intense AZ sun and plenty of seating. Huge sushi bar with flashy sushi chef wearing a sequins-encrusted NYC hat - greets you when you walk in. We were seated at a table in the main area. The waitress was experienced but more into chatting than serving. She knew the menu and details of the rolls. She was very helpful, when you could catch her. She liked to drop and run. For a place that wasn't very busy either. Happy hour menu is extensive but full of the regular rolls that aren't very interesting. Which is fine, if the full price items are quality - which happily they were. The rolls are huge. We ordered way too much food. For 3 of us, with wine, was $70.  We took more than half home and had it for later. I wouldn't call this a place you could get a quick meal but I would definitely visit here again.    Garlic edamame sounds good, but don't bother - get plain. It's just garlic powder dusted on the shells then microwaved. Gyoza is good with a spicy dipping sauce. The salmon roll with the lemon slice was choice: Lety in love. Kodiak and Blue Flame were choice. Don't get the Tempura roll - just order the shrimp tempura appetizer. It's so much better.",

The menu is super extensive and has a giant variety that you can really choose from. Rolls, ramen, somen, nigiri, etc. The drink menu also offers a lot of beer, wine, and sake as well. The portions are large, particularly for the price.   Now the thing that I really didn't like about this place was the ridiculous wait time for the food. When my friends and I arrived, the place was busy, but definitely not packed or full. We put in an order for 4 rolls (2 of them being vegetarian) and did not even see our food for a good 20-30 minutes. During this entire time, our server did not drop in or check in on us to see if we needed water or anything else. When we finally got the food, it was just so-so. Pretty basic sushi rolls that aren't incredible or spectacular in any way, shape, or form.   I appreciate that they have vegetarian choices including a vegetarian sushi set and vegetarian rolls (avocado/cucumber roll, vegetarian roll, vegetarian tempura roll, super vegetarian roll, etc.), but probably will not return due to the crazy wait time for food.",

It took a while for me to find a good sushi restaurant. Being that we are in the middle of the desert, it was hard to find a place that served good tasting/fresh sushi until I came to Akai Hana. I've gone to both locations and both places had the most fresh tasting sushi. I always order the rainbow roll and it was very delicious here.   The staff was also very kind and attentive to their guests. Our waiter was always checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything. We didn't come during a slow period, so the staff is very on top of their customers.   Can't wait to go back for my weekly sushi date with my sister :)",

We had a number of rolls, I wish I could remember them all now but they were all fabulous.  My only complaint is that the service is very slow.  Our waitress brought us waters and disappeared for about 20 minutes.  I had to flag her down to place our order and to get the check.  However despite that I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "This place can get busy really quickly, not just because of the size of their dining area, but because people just keep flocking to get their sushi and Japanese food fill. When I say fill, I actually mean it. Their portions are glorious, the taste is fresh and the textures are wonderful. The only issue is that it can take a while to get said amazing food to the table, specially at lunch, when time is of the essence. So instead of blaming them for how popular they are locally, I'd advice you to take a long lunch instead and kick back and order the fried cheesecake and just have a really great time.",

From the salmon skin roll  (crunchy and savory) to the the mistake roll (stuffed with yummy goodies), it was all nummy and the prices were more than reasonable. If my review were only based on food, it would easily be 5 stars. However, the food isn't the only element to consider. What makes this a 3-star experience is having to argue with my waiter about the amount of food we ordered. There were three of us and we were hungry. We have no issues putting away some food and we know what we can eat. So having the waiter come to us and say \"No, this is too much food. You order too much.\" And he repeated this multiple times as we told him, \"No, this is our order. We know what we ordered.\" After he repeatedly let us know that we ordered too much, I asked him, \"Are you honestly telling us what we can order?\" And he replied, \"Yes, it's too much.\" Seriously? I then said that this was our order and if he didn't like it we can leave. He finally took our order and walked away. During our meal we had to ask another waiter for drinks as ours were never refilled. I guess he was just mad that we ordered too much?   If I do come back, I'll have to ask for a different waiter. Maybe then I'll be able to actually enjoy the meal.",

I was probably about 13 years old when my parents introduced me to Mr. Sushi and I had only ever tried a california roll before.  Well Akai Hana opened my mind to so many other varities of sushi.  I fell in love with tuna :)   They also serve hot dishes and bento boxes. Very authentic with a variety of seafood, good prices and happy hour all of the time until 5pm and after 8pm-9/10pm depending on the day of the week.  My favorite happy hour rolls are the blue flame, spicy tuna hand roll, and the tuna roll.  This is probably my favorite sushi place of all time.  My family and I have spent almost every birthday here since I we have been coming here together for about 15 years.  On birthdays the sushi chefs will  make a special roll for you or bring out green tea ice cream with a candle in it and take a couple of polaroid pix for their wall and one for you to take home.  You can also call and request there special room for a more intimate time with a larger party of people.  I highly recommend giving this place a shot-you will have a great experience from the moment you walk in when the sushi chefs personally greet to the moment you leave with a belly full of sushi :)",

    "text": "This is my friend's favorite sushi place in Phoenix. We came here for dinner last night and I was slightly impressed! The menu is gigantic like overwhelmingly gigantic. I was so flustered trying to look at all the options so I managed to pick one roll that I really wanted. I thought I was still going to be hungry so the second roll I ordered was a rush screw it I'm just going to put my finger in the menu and order that since I spent so much time picking the first one.   To start, we had the gyoza. It was good nothing special though.. just the typical. Super crispy on the outside. To drink, I ordered the matchatini. It was vodka, matcha, lemon juice, and I think some kind of sake? Dont quote me on the last part. It came blended with ice and it was delcious. It was almost like a very light matcha frap from starbucks in flavor with a subtle hint of vodka flavor. I would have ordered 50.   As for rolls, I ordered the rose royce ( this was my point and pick roll) and my first roll i cant remember the name of it but it dyatted with an R and had spicy tuna and butter salmon in it. The second roll was delicious best roll I have had in a while. The butter salmon was cooked slightly on the outside and the inside was still raw. The spicy tuna flavor was not lost at all but the butter salmon was definitely the power flavor. This roll was definitely rich in flavor. The rose royce was ok. I ordered it because it had habanero sauce in it and i wanted something spicy. It wasnt that spicy so do try it. The roll had lemon on top but it was cut too thick so it was just a very big punch on lemon which i did not like. Once I pulled that off it was better but then it was just a spicy tuna roll with tuna on top with spicy mayo, sriracha, and habanero sauce.   I sampled my friend's dish. It was spicy tuna on top of tempura eggplant. That was really good. It was light and airy for the tempura and they put a ton of tuna on top. It was so much she had to pull some of of each piece to eat it, which is a great thing!",

    "text": "My family currently lives in Sedona, AZ but I lived in New York City for 30 years, where the standards of sushi quality are high. We have often lamented the sad quality, limited menu, and lack of artistry in Southwest sushi joints. But Akaihana was recommended to us by a Japanese friend, so we checked it out on our next visit to Phoenix.  We now think it's worth it to drive two hours JUST for Akaihana.  Why? Just about everything: the portions are huge, and the prices are amazingly low. The skill of the chefs is superb. The service is excellent, the space is huge, clean, and often busy (but not full!).   An example: Yesterday, we ordered for 2 adults and 3 kids under 7: * 4x miso soup * 3x white rice * 2x edamame * spinach appetizer * tsukemono (pickle) appetizer * a salmon skin hand roll (the biggest I have EVER seen, by far) * a carrot & cucumber roll (for the vegetarian child) * Rainbow Roll (huge, delicious, easily a meal by itself) * 2x Salmon Sashimi * Yellowtail Sashimi (dizzyingly good)  The bill before tax was $69. And we boxed up almost a quarter of the food we couldn't finish for a midnight snack.  It is great for kids, but also has nice spaces for a more adult meal (the West side of the restaurant has an open, well-lit, less formal space, more like a food court, while the East side of the restaurant has banquette seating and dimmer light.",

We tried the Annie Oakley, rainbow, and Manhattan rolls. All were good except the Manhattan roll, mainly because we think their oil was about 3 days too old. There is a difference between food being oily, and just tasting oily. In this case, you can clearly just taste and smell old oil. Shame because had it not been old oil, that roll would have been very good. I recommend ordering any roll that does not have a fried component to it, anything on the fresher uncooked spectrum, because the fish is legitimately fresh.",

I would say this place has the best California roll I've ever tasted, it taste very fresh. The dinner special comes with a salad that has different fresh meats and the cucumber is thinly sliced like spaghetti, it's called the Japanese Dynamite... yum!    Another time I stopped by decided to be more adventurous and I tried the Mountain salad that comes with a variety to vegetables (it was in the happy hour menu) and let's just say it was very salty and I couldn't eat.  My boyfriend tried their spicy chicken (on the happy hour menu) and he was very surprised for the amount that was given to him. It was also not very spicy but just enough for the flavor, he ended up dipping it in wasabi for an extra kick.    Definitely a place to check out, the menu is incredible!",

Their rolls are some of the biggest in the valley. This is the first time we had been here in a while and  they have totally redone the inside and have even expanded into the suite next to them. If you are by yourself or like sitting and watching them make the sushi, their sushi bar has been expanded and looks excellent.  On this trip we started with the garlic edamame which tasted great. We then ordered the California crunch, blue flame and the Angela. The California crunch is your typical roll but it adds some crunchiness to the outside of the roll. The blue flame is crab, crab stick, avocado and sweet and spicy sauce. It has great taste over all. The Angela had always been my favorite roll at Mr Sushi (its old name). It is straight up delicious. It is deep fried crab salad, cream cheese, jalapeno, baked with cheese and a spicy sauce. It comes out piping hot so you have to wait a bit to eat it. But trust me, it is fabulous. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for a bite to eat, especially during their happy hour.",

Very friendly staff and good service.  Sitting at counters is never very romantic, so if the tvs ruin the mood, sit instead at a cozy table for two.  Food and price, especially, much better than any of the Scottsdale places.  Drop in and say Hi to Steve, David, Sean, Leddie, Kohei, Hanino, Gin, Hashino, Nao and the rest of the gang.

They have a some nice boat dishes that look cool in presentation.  There does not seem like anything special is around this restaurant so it stands alone to me.   The service is friendly but is too busy and has some language road bumps but they did keep the place neat and clean.   The price was typical for most sushi places I have been too however, they did not have an all you can eat option.  The best part of the meal was the desert that was not on the main menu. I thought that it was ridiculous that they would leave it off. I saw others with the ice cream tempura on their table and I wanted it too. Since the sushi takes 15 plus minutes after ordering I ordered the ice cream first. It was totally worth it, it was beautiful and fun!  The hollywood roll was my favorite but the eel roll, which is my standard, was not what I thought it would be. Only some of the rolls were great. (Hollywood and ice cream tempura, however your mileage may vary - ymmv).  If it was convenient I might try it again for happy hour.",

    "text": "Akaihana Sushi is my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix.  Pros:  Sleek modern interior.  Inexpensive sushi. Cons:  Weekend service is poor/slow.  TV's make it not so romantic.  Secret:  Happy Hour or Lunch.  If at all possible go during when they are serving happy hour (which is very frequent, especially during \"lunch\" type timeframes), as it dramatically reduces the cost of a meal.  Best Items To Order (in terms of quality for value):  The Sushi Lunch Special at $9 is a bargain if you are there at lunch.  You get a bowl of miso soup, a little side salad, and a plate of sushi that includes about 5 pieces of fish on rice, as well as a spicy salmon hand roll.  A great way to get a little sushi fix for less than $10.  Hand Roll Special - Like above but has a spicy tuna hand roll and spicy salmon hand roll, then 3 cheap filler rolls (california, veggie, and sweet egg).  For $9 it's also a pretty good value, but only if you like the filler rolls.  For any time there is Happy Hour, you can get distracted by about 3 dozen items.  Most are cheaper rolls, deep fried, etc.   But I'll give you the low down... as there are only 2 really good non-fried options/bargains on it:  1) Spicy Albacore Roll - $5.50.  It's a medium sized roll with spicy albacore in the middle, covered with crunch particles and a spicy mayo sauce.    2) Rainbow Roll - $8.75.  This is the BARGAIN.  It's a giant california roll covered with thick cuts of sashimi.  For someone with a light/medium appetite, you could order this as a meal.  Anyway, this is a great sushi restaurant.  I'm not saying it's got the very best quality sushi in Phoenix.  I'm sure there are much more expensive, better options out there.  But it's the best VALUE in Phoenix when it comes to Sushi, and the only one I visit ever couple weeks.",

What I found was an interior under moderate renovation which left the ambiance rather concerning.  With bare walls and raw sheet rock I considered cleanliness.  I sat at the bar and received moderately hasty service during a busy lunch rush.  What I ordered:  Cucumber salad, which was clunky and entirely too much for an appetizer salad.  It resembled veggie spaghetti which was difficult to eat without worry.  The flavor was flat.  Fresh Oysters, delightful yet small.  Both appetizers were served AFTER my Nigiri order of Unagi, Salmon and Yellowtail.  All 3 orders of Nigiri were delicate and fresh.  Exactly what you would expect from raw fish albeit they were served on WARM sushi rice.   Overall, the potential for a great experience is there!  Will I return, yes!   Next up: Hamachi Kama ( which is another of my gauges of Great Japanese cuisine.) Cost out the door for lunch with tea- $30.00 - but I did splurge!",

    "text": "It has great reviews, but I just found this place... okay. It's located in a little center that looks completely new... yet abandoned. There were only a couple of cars in the parking lot right next to this place. The interior feels old even though the exterior looks new. There's a bar and a few tables. It is the kind of restaurant where you pay at the cashier/hostess stand, which is located to the left when you walk in. They sell little trinkets and stuff inside and on the cashier/hostess stand - like lollipops and decorations. There are photographs everywhere of customers. Seriously. Everywhere! Half of the menu is pasted on the walls on pieces of paper. I'm not even kidding. It looks the employees made up rolls, and instead of adding new items to the actual menu, they drew on paper like elementary school children. Some of them are ripped and falling apart. I think it takes away from the seriousness of being an actual business. I ordered jalapeno tempura and a shrimp tempura roll. There was a lady sitting next to me, and I noticed they gave one of my rolls (the jalapeno tempura) to her. I could tell. They quickly took it away and told her they messed up. The guy hid it behind the bar, and then, he handed it to me after a couple minutes. Really?! Thank goodness I noticed that the lady hadn't touched it. Otherwise, I would've totally asked for a remake. Instead, I kept my mouth shut. It was okay. It probably would've been a lot better if I got it fresh. The shrimp tempura roll was just okay as well. I'm sorry. I just didn't enjoy my experience very much here.",

Not realizing how much food we were ordering, we got the blue flame, Philadelphia and Tokyo rolls along with Beef Tataki. It was way too much food for 2 people. It was all excellent, especially the Beef Tataki.   We came on our lunch break, and the place was busy, but wait times were reasonable. Service was very friendly. I appreciated the fact that the waitstaff didn't seem territorial at all. If we needed a refill and a server was passing, they just offered a refill. It's refreshing compared to restaurants where your one and only server is overloaded and can't give you the attention you need.  We will definitely return.",

If you want to try a roll that'll blow your mind, get the Butter Me Up roll. I don't normally like cooked rolls, but this one is perfection.

However, I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had read a lot of the previous reviews including some really horrible ones, but decided that those seemed few and far between.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the slow service. All the servers were very friendly and helpful, but it was a little slow to get just about anything.  We ordered shumai appitizer, miso soup and four rolls. The Blue Flame roll was my husbands favorite, its fried, but lightly so it doesn't have a lot of crunch which we both really enjoyed. We also ordered a dragon roll, Jan roll and baked scallop roll. All the rolls were good, fresh and presented well. And considering the price, its a great value.  I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Nothing too stellar about this establishment, everything is the way it should be.  The reason I gave three stars was that my rolls kept falling apart when I picked them up with the chop sticks, it was very hard to manage and then a section would fall out and I had to scoop it up.  The cucumber salad is different and with long shredded strands of cucumber and a nice sesame sprinkle a light vinegar dressing. I did nothing out the ordinary on the rolls as i ordered from the Happy Hour specials - great prices BTW!  Its a decent place to try, so swing by if you have a craving.",

Tonight I decided to give it another shot. The overpriced food was ok, at best. I found plastic pieces in my rolls... When I mentioned it, nicely, the waitress acknowledged it was disgusting and flicked it off her finger.  Our waitress obviously has never served before. She put priority on taking pictures with her friends over her job. We didn't get a single refill, worse, not even asked for one the hour and a half we were here. I waited for 30 minutes to close out the bill. I literally walked the tab to her register. She blushed and said, \"oh, ha, I forgot.\" Save your money and your time, go to Tomo.",

I get it - crab salad implies mayo most of the time, but how about just a dab to bind it? I could not even tell which roll was crab, which was shrimp, and which was scallop because of mayo overload. I also hate when I can't finish off a piece of a roll in one bite. Seriously, this is the most mayo-ridden, overly huge maki I have ever experienced. The happy hour prices are tempting, but you would be better off at Kona or Sekana.

Let me tell you, I am no longer snobbish!  We went for HH and since I had a large lunch, I wasn't too terribly hungry.  I decided to try their Pacific Oysters (@ 3 for $6.00) pretty good deal.  I had only been used to East Coast Oysters so I had nothing to compare to.  If you are used to East Coast Oysters, go to Akaihana anytime and try their Pacific Oysters.  Beware though, 1 oyster is as big as your face!!!  Definitely worth the 3 for $6.00. Each oyster was crisp, clean and meaty!  Very sweet and the mignionette sauce was divine!!!  I ordered a 1/2 dozen, which was by far too much, but I happily ate them anyway and just didn't have to have dinner.  The sake bomber price was ok but at Stingray Sushi it is cheaper (by $2.00).  I am going to go back  and try their sushi during happy hour and hope to come away pleasantly surprised!!!",

It started off terribly when the server didn't even give us the menus and we had to bring them ourselves. Later after we ordered, our starters didn't come until after 40 minutes and we were not given any plates or bowls to eat on. After another hour two rolls of sushi were served. Among three of us it wasn't a lot of food and we were patiently waiting for our order. After 2 hours of waiting the server came with the check not even mentioning our food that was never served. We decided not to wait any longer, pay for what we ate and cancel the rest of the order. It took another 30 minutes for the waitress to split the check in between three of us and figure out the change. It was a big waste of our afternoon- 2.5 hours and still hungry. But the best is at the end! I came home and checked my bank account and I was charged $25 more than what I was billed for!! Tomorrow I have to go and argue with them again. I will not be revisiting that place ever again. I strongly DO NOT recommend it!",

My overall take on this place is it's a bit pricey for what they deliver, the service is mediocre to good, the chefs only semi-helpful. Food quality generally quite good, although I have noted some sloppy preparation lately. I've taken to ordering the catering special Samurai Platter lately to go, 7 rolls for $35. This is probably their best value, but last time the rolls fell apart and the tuna was kind of mushy. Still, they have the best caterpillar roll I've ever had. Guess I'd recommend this one with some cautions.",

The only downsides to this place would be that the service is a little slow there's usually only about one or two waitresses but all of the cook are rolling sushi rolls fresh by hand so of course that's going to take some time.

    "text": "I love good sushi, and what I got last night was not good sushi.  There are some things that I get, or try to get, every time I go for sushi: tamago (not always available), smoked salmon nigiri, and Philly rolls.  Add edamame for an appetizer and I'm pretty happy.  Eel sauce in a ramekin is always a good thing for dipping.  Last night was a great disappointment.  Let's address the specifics of what I ordered.  First, the salmon nigiri was mis-cut.  It should be cut with the grain/fat strands at a right angle to the length of the fillet, so that you can easily bite through it.  It was not, so each bite required additional work to separate the piece you just bit from the remainder.  The flavor of the salmon was marginal, I don't know if it wasn't smoked just right or what.  I don't think the fish was bad in that it didn't smell, but the flavor just wasn't right.  Philly rolls.  I realize this is 'white man's sushi', but I like it.  I have never been known to leave any sushi standing when I finish my meal, even at a joint in Dallas where I left a scathing review, and yet I left half my Philly rolls un-et.  Numerous problems presented themselves, starting with the rolls were not tight, resulting in them falling apart when picked up.  I'm not sure how to express what was wrong with the cucumber, I think it boils down to it was mushy, not crisp.  Maybe it wasn't cold when cut or they chose the wrong area to cut from?  The flavor was unexceptional, I expect a crisp bite with a punch of the cream cheese, a crisp crunch of the cucumber, and the subtle flavors of the smoked salmon.  This roll had none of that, and thus half of it was left behind.  I will complement them on the tamago, though it was not listed on the menu as such.  This is the first time that I've seen it listed on the menu as 'Sweet Egg', which it is, but if I don't see it under tamago, I assume it isn't there.  But I asked for it, and I got it.  And it was good.  At least this one thing was done well, though it would have held together better if they'd used longer seaweed cuts to wrap the band around it to attach it to the rice puck.  The salmon nigiri, likewise, was not directly on the menu.  I asked for it and got it, but as I said, it was disappointing.  The edamame was decent, but unremarkable.  They didn't strike me as freshly steamed/hot, possibly they'd been sitting waiting for the waitress.  They also offer 'garlic edamame', I'm not sure what the difference is but it might simply be using garlic salt instead of regular, and it really didn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  Speaking of enhancing flavor, the eel sauce was also disappointing.  I'm not sure what it was, but the flavor just did not appeal.  We ordered two other rolls there.  One was a crab roll, not a crab salad roll as my companion has a mayonnaise sensitivity, and it was good.  We both liked it.  Pleasant flavors, quite yummy.  The other roll, whose name I do not recall nor do I want to, had an off-putting aroma and the flavor did nothing to overcome that.  A couple pieces of that were also left behind.  And glancing at Meg's review in the sidebar, I think there might also be a seasoning problem with the sushi rice.  I'm not entirely certain on that one, but that could explain why many of the flavors were just not quite right.  In the end, a bad evening at a restaurant that will not see us again.  This was also a scouting mission for places to frequent in the future since our favorite sushi place closed down, but this is not a place to which I will be returning.  It is possible that they had their 'B Team' working last night, but my companion and I agreed that one star is all they deserved and we won't be back.  One final comment.  I notice that their ratings have been steadily trending down over the last couple of months.  It seems to me that something has happened here and I hope their decline is temporary for their sake.",

    "text": "This place was recommended by 2 friends when it was called Mr. Sushi.  My wife and I met up with another couple here for dinner this week.  When we walked in, the person working the host/hostess booth asked one of the server's to seat us and she responded with attitude.  This pretty much set the tone for the rest of the evening.  1.  Wife's beverage didn't make it out until after 20 minutes of being seated and after 3 requests.  2.  It was hit or miss with some of the rolls we ordered.  The California Roll fell apart when trying to eat it with chop sticks.  The crab mix tasted off.  3.  Server didn't clear the table and we sat with finished plates cluttering our table until we paid our bill.  4.  One of our rolls was forgotten about and was brought out to us when everyone finished their sushi and entrees.  Some positives of Akaihana is that the quantity of sushi was plentiful and the price was very reasonable.  Some of the other staff seemed friendly but unfortunately we drew the short straw.  My wife doesn't want to have anything to do with the place but I'm willing to give it another shot sometime down the road.",

I moved back to Phoenix after a year long stay in Los Angeles (and after finding the best sushi restaurant ever; Toshi Sushi in Silverlake), I was very wary of the sushi here. I tried Ra over in Tempe and thought it was only okay. And, not wanting to drive all the way across the valley for only decent sushi, looked for places closer to the western part of town.   Service was nothing exceptional or memorable, waitress was sweet though. I think next time we'll try sitting at the bar. We ordered quite a variety, most notably the spicy tuna rolls (amaaazing), and a few specialty ones that I can't remember. Definitely good enough to come back, especially with happy hour prices!   It's a little bit hard to find and a little far away from me, but worth it in the end! I'd definitely recommend it.",

I am a lover of great Japanese food and finding one seems to be a difficult undertaking in the Phoenix area. Akaihana's food is fantastic and reasonably priced. I love to get the Mr. Sushi Bento for lunch. It has everything you could ask for in a bento (including a very fresh price of sashimi tuna) and the quality of the meat is great. This place is not fancy, and you won't be bombarded with the standard high-volume techno drumbeats that most sushi places seem to have; much more traditional here. two thumbs way up!",

After checking Yelp and what was nearby I found that there were many more than just fast food bowl chains.  This online menu looked to fit the bill and would give the hubby a sushi fix as well.  The place was easy to find as there are not many other businesses around.  The space is nice and intimate but not too cramped.  There were a lot of people there and the menu was quite extensive.  I had the yakisoba and the hubby had teriyaki chicken and some sushi.  The portions are HUGE and the tea excellent.  I had the mango ice cream for dessert was was absolute bliss.",

They have dedicated half of the sushi bar to a waitress service area and they never seat people efficiently at the sushi bar so our party of three is always bumped to a table even if three different chairs spread out across the bar are open.  We lose the conversation with the sushi chef, the conversation with other sushi lovers, the motivation to try new sushi and fast service.

    "text": "I come to Akaihana a lot. Like far more than I probably should given it's almost the opposite end of town for me. There a couple reasons I come here but the key ones are fair prices and good sushi. The others are it's a nice central meeting spot for my buddies and I and also right by my girlfriends work.  When I come here 9 out of 10 times I am ordering the Sushi Special ($13) which is a cali roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, a spicy salmon hand roll, miso soup and their special salad. The salad (on the menu as dynamite salad) is one of my favorite things it's cucumber noodles with chunks of various fish in a light but spicy marinade. The salad size with the sushi special is a pretty decent size but the half size on the menu is pretty much a meal for 1 person for $7. It does tend to be a bit of a crap shoot on the quantity of the fish in it though. The sushi special as a whole though is a solid meal even for somebody like me who can put down a lot of sushi.  Happy hour prices are fantastic here and run almost all day on the weekdays. I think cali rolls run about $3.50 on happy hour and spicy tuna isn't much more.  Other things I have liked are the shrimp boats which are pretty unique and they have plenty of other in house special rolls.  There are two reasons why this place isn't a five star, the first and primary being service. The service here can be really hit or miss, sometimes is great and things come out quick and you get attended to quickly. Other times you may wait 10 minutes for a drink refill or 30 minutes+ for sushi. I've had cases where we have been in and out in about 30-45 minutes and other times where it took 30 minutes before we got the first roll. I've also had items get forgotten or watched them sit ready at the counter for 10 minutes before having to ask the status. This is really amplified when the restaurant is busy. However I will say the servers are very nice and never rude or off putting, they just aren't always on the ball.  The second issue is minor but worth noting in that the rolls can sometimes be rolled too loose where they come apart too easy. Sometimes I think this is an issue with the rice they are using and sometimes the chef. I don't have much of an issue working around this but it's hard for chopstick newbies or those who aren't fully comfortable with chopsticks.  Overall the value, fish quality and options for tasty bites here far outweigh the service issues.",

I am so excited to go back, it's very clean and comfortable inside too! Their prices are great! What's not to love!",

    "text": "My girlfriend was craving some sushi and our regular place is closed on Sundays so a coworker of hers suggested this place.  Really disappointing.  While they have an extensive menu, there are lots of rolls that they have no description for.  Its frustrating to assume that everyone that comes in to your restaurant is a sushi expert or that they would have to sit there and ask what various rolls are.  My girlfriends sashimi came out and the fish were no where near as cold as you'd want raw fish to be and they used a ton of imitation crab in their hand rolls.  Basically left her with edamame and jalapeno poppers.  When jalapeno poppers are the best thing on a customers tab by a wide margin in a SUSHI restaurant, might want to get some new chefs in there.  I ordered somen noodles (which where pictured and looked nothing like the picture) teriyaki chicken (could have used another 30 seconds in the microwave or maybe less time in the window), rice and goyza (over priced, for the number of pieces you get, 5) and a cherry coke.    Ironically the cherry coke was REALLY good, i believe they used cherry syrup in addition to the coca-cola as opposed to the cherry coke that coca-cola company produces.  The service was pretty lacking, all in all not worth the drive and the happy hour on Sunday was enough to get us in there but I can't imagine returning.",

We arrived just before the 8PM Happy Hour started and boy was this place packed. At first we were not sure we were going to stay but we walked inside and saw how packed it was and saw large platters of sushi going out to every table. We were sold! This place is not in the best of neighborhoods so we were a little skeptical, especially of sushi. However, we were pleasantly surprised. We got the Aloha roll (which was a bit fishy tasting), the Hollywood roll which was my fav, teriyaki chicken and rice for the kiddo (which was excellent), a sushi and sashimi (raw slices of various fish and octopus) sampler platter, a la carte yellowtail belly meat sashimi (which is my all-time favorite cut of sushi) and it was a high quality and done right here (to give the melt-in-your mouth effect). We also had a roll that had predominately fried elements to it which was the bf's favorite. For dessert, they had cheesecake tempura that I had to try because it sounded interesting and I've never had that before. This was our least liked dish. We would never get it again because there were ice chunks in the middle of the cake and it taste like frozen cheesecake from the box with tempura on in a flashed in the fryer, with strawberries on the side then drizzled chocolate syrup. 2 rounds of saki-bombs were fun as well.  Overall the price was great and the food was really good. This will be one of my new Happy Hour spots.",

Each sushi chef has his own unique style/flare and it is definitely represented in their cooking.

Since it was my first time here and the closest Japanese food to my home that I plan to frequent when I need my fix which is often, I decided to try quite a few dishes.  We started with Gyoza, mixed tempura and Spring rolls for appetizers. Spring rolls were nice and light and very flavorful but the Gyoza was a little to \"well done\" for my taste, should be crispy on one side and soft on the other, mixed tempura has two large shrimp, 2 broccoli florets and one slice of eggplant. We ordered chicken teriyaki and a side of rice from the Happy H menu for my son since they don't have a \"kids\" menu, he really enjoyed it. We ordered 3 maki rolls assuming they would be small since they come from happy hour menu but they were quite large (spicy tuna, spicy albacore and California tempura rolls). I'm always trying to find a great Ramen joint since returning from vac in Tokyo so I ordered a Spicy Miso Ramen. Ramen took quite a while to arrive and was a bit bland. The noodles had an \"instant noodle\" quality and no egg included. I think people come for the sushi instead of the Ramen here, Shame because everyone deserves great Ramen.  Overall I was impressed with the happy hour menu, and definitely recommend this place to get your sushi fix.",

Even when it's just my daughter and me, for some reason they decide to do half the page and ALWAYS neglect hers! We have waited so long for her food that I actually had to stop eating mine to wait or I would have been completely done. They need to learn restaurant etiquette- do not serve the table until the whole table's food is ready. It's uncomfortable and frankly embarrassing asking everyone else to please eat while you wait and wait and wait for your food.",

Our food took 45 minutes to arrive for three rolls and a noodle soup.   We had: Manhattan Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sunset Roll and the Nabeyaki Udon.   Overall the food is not good. Fairly bland, slightly hard rice that is the wrong kind of sticky.  The salmon is not pink, but that odd light orange color of not so good fish. The rolls are haphazardly rolled, the interior shape squashed and oblong.  Inconsistent piece by piece.  I will not return.  It was not worth the time or money.   If you want decent sushi check out Yen.   Sunset Roll: The fish is sliced messy, no care for details was taken, and placed over the roll in a sloppy hastened manner. The lemon that is placed on top also inconsistently cut, randomly sized and shaped.  The rind was left on the lemon.  Unpleasant. The salmon as I mentioned above, was not good.   Manhattan Roll:  Was only passable because the shrimp was deep fried and it had sauces with flavor. Same rice and shape problems.   Spicy Tuna:  not good.  The tuna was too light a shade of pink. Bland in flavor, and made too spicy to make up for lack of taste.  Shape and rice problems.   Udon: Bland, flavorless. Needed basic things like salt. Was not hot, just somewhat warm upon arrival. The tempura shrimp accompanying it was also bland.   Odd dirty drawings of sushi rolls on the walls drawn using markers and crayons. I thought they were children's drawings at first.",

And I loved the unique way that the Las Vegas was made with the jalapenos and salsa verde. The rice on the rolls were also moist and fell apart easily while maintaining its shape on the platter. It was not stiff like some rolls at other places, which was a plus! Only downside is that it is a little pricey. The spicy tuna roll was $4.95 during happy hour which is reasonable, but was regularly priced as $6.75. Still a great restaurant though!",

We had the summer tomato sushi an unusual feature in itself, the Sakura and, well all I have to ask Norm to remind me but that was good too. The portions were unusually large the individual pieces were unusually large, making them a little unwieldy and for slightly messy eating, but all were excellent. At 1:30 on a Sunday I assume we arrived after any lunch time rush, and in any event our weight was not unduly long but given the quantity and quality of the food I think it would have been worth waiting for. Additional compliments on friendly, attentive service. My water glass never stayed empty for long.  Pleasantly full on Sushi. I wasn't sure such a thing was possible. Highly recommend.",

I felt so bad because I hated that when I worked in retail and just wanted to close up my store and someone would walk in two minutes till closing. That sometimes is bad too because you may get the remnants of what was good earlier that day and isn't anymore.   We promised to be fast and we ordered really fast and the food was on our table really fast. We devoured our meal with delight. The rolls were so good. Some of the best sushi I have had. I cant remember what I bought but everything was good. Even the spicy stuff I tried. I don't normally eat the spicy stuff but this stuff was really good. My uncle was right about this place.

    "text": "AKA Mr. Sushi... that's what one of the signs say on the building. I have gone to sushi fairly regularly for years starting back when I lived in California and I think this is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix because of the selection, quality/freshness of food, happy hour and portion sizes.  Standard prices normally, but they have a really good sushi happy hour from 4-6 and the portions are bigger than average.  The atmosphere is what I expect from a real Japanese joint that is geared for good food, not fancy advertising or upscale decor. The chef (owner?), most of the employees as well as a good percentage of the patrons speak Japanese so you know it's not a bullshit sushi place.  The quality of the fish has always been very good and the selection of items is grand. I especially enjoy the blue fin (aka toro) nigiri; it's probably the best I've had. I have been impressed with everything I have ordered.",

I had talked a friend into trying sushi one more time (the first time was at a place in Sedona my mistake!).  We ordered the Hollywood roll - SWEET LORD was it good my friend said it was one of the best foods he ever had never mind the sushi part it was just that good.  We also tried the Hannah roll which was very good as well!  Please support this place, so many places are disappearing in Phx due to the economy and its hard enough to find Good food in Phx let alone this great!  If you use Sherpa or a I phone ap please review its what helped me find this place!  I usually won't try a unreviewed place as food is usually poor quailty in Phx.",

In general, service is better at the bar (and you still may wait there awhile, too). --All too often one must flag down a waitress or waiter for things from the kitchen. Of late, the wait staff don't look towards the diners ---you really have to wave and call out. If you just wave, they will walk past you. --  Sushi/sashimi presentation varies per chef. The younger male chef is consistently more careful and artful with his creations. The older male chef can be careless at times --creating messy and disappointing dishes.  Sometimes the same sauces seem to taste better than at other times. I had a poorer \"taste\" experience on the weekend compared to during the week. Maybe I got the dregs of the sauce --when workers were too busy to make a fresh batch...  All in all, I'm ready to explore new options.",
