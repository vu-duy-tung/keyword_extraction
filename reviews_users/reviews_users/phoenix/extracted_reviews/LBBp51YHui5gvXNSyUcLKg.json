That's saying something.  I think the best part was the bean dip (I think it was beans) they serve with their chips.  There was nothing memorable after that.  The best and really only good thing about Valle Luna is its location.  It sits right on the Anderson Springs \"waterfront\" so if you can get the patio, go for it.",

We have so many mexican restarants in the valley to choose from  but what does impress me is that every time I have gone, the food is consistently good.Good chips and salsa which is very important. I love the margaritas there because they are never watered down tasting in fact, they tend to be a little heavy on the liquor which is a good thing but know that  before you plan to drive. I personally don't drink if I am so I always go there and make my husband drive ;-) It is a great place to meet people for food and drinks because they never rush you and it is very relaxed and friendly there.

Each couple printed out our coupons as we were all going to pay separately.  Everything was going great, the service was fast and courteous and the food was good, but when it came to paying for our check we were told that they would only honor one coupon since we were all sitting at the same table, even though we alerted our waiter to the fact that we were all paying separately and he said that would be fine.  After a few tense minutes with the manager, he reluctantly agreed to accept the coupons.  Aside from that the experience was okay.  The party I was with really likes Mexican food, so I'm sure they would rate it higher.  I had the shrimp fajitas I would rate as a 6 compared to the best shrimp fajitas I have ever had.",

We got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking lot is an overflowing open gated nasty dumpster with boxes and rotton food spewing out. We nearly turned around and said S@REW THIS, but we didn't.  Inside we asked the host for patio seating which she said was booked; however, there was first-come-first-serve on the bar patio. Scored a ringside seat next to the lake! Yippie! I'm so gettin' some tonight with this setting. However, the ambiance was really marred by 2 things. First was the wafting of clouds of cigarette smoke lofting into our serene spot. Ewww, not to be a hypocrite as I smoked like 12 years ago..no check that cigarettes are gross. The other issue was the EXTREMELY INTOXICATED middle aged foul mouthed trashy cougar hooker seated behind us. Her and her skank girlfriend sat down about 1/2 hour after we did and she was friggin' hammered upon being seated. She later exclaimed to her friend about how she'd been drinking wine ALL DAY...yea really, you handle and hide it well. I totally shook my head as I watched the server dude take her order and thought, \"Dude you're not really going to serve that sloshy puddle more booze are you?\" and he did - and multiple times. Unbelievable! Where's the Liquor Board when they're needed.   The other issue about the facility is the stank in the bar area. It has the aroma of a high school boys locker room. They really need to address this as it's nasty...carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned this millennium.   You can't go wrong drinking a Corona Light in this atmoshere and my wife had a Don Julio Blanca Marg Rocks that was good to. Later she prdered teh same but with a Chambord shot in it...awesome drink!  My wife loves that they serve a bean dip with the chips and I thought the salsa was very tasty and chunky. I hate it when the salsa is watery thin. Chips were good ny wife said as I don't eat them.   My wife had red cili enchiladas that were just ok...nothing special. I was pleased to see sea bass on the menu...yea! Ordered it but the server forgot to ask me which of the 2 sauces I wanted or about the sides. I flagged him down and told him the sauce and also said that I didn't want any rice. Food comes, there's the friggin' rice all over my plate. I'm not really picky but seriously I asked specifically for no rice and there it is and it's not like you can just push it aside as it crosses the international borders into the veggies, beans and fish sauce...forced to have a re-make. 8 minutes later and my wife is 1/2 done and here it comes back out. Looks good...taste is stone cold...what a shame as it was a good looking piece of fish.   Without that lake...we would never come back.",

Our waiter never came to check on us, other than taking our order and bringing the food, which meant we had empty water glasses most of the time. Not cool. But on the plus side, they have a killer bean dip. I'd go back just to eat the chips and bean dip, but probably sit in the bar for (hopefully) better service.",

We walked around the beautiful view of the lake while we were waiting which was really nice. Once we were seated, we decided to order some drinks and appetizers. We went for what we thought was \"happy hour\" to enjoy 1/2 price apps and reduced priced drinks, but we were told by the waitress you could not order from that menu at a table, only at the bar. As we were eating we noticed it was getting really warm. When we asked the waitress she said the air condition was broke. My husband asked why we weren't told by the hostess, because we may have decided to go elsewhere. She didn't have an answer and proceeded to get a manager. The manager was very rude and was trying to tell us that she thought the temp was fine. It was definitely not fine. We were sweating at the table. We weren't trying to get anything for free, we had already paid the bill. We were just looking for an explanation. We left very unsatisfied. We probably will go back because the food was ok, and the location is very close to our house. But if we had similar poor service after our next visit, we would definitely not go back a third time.",

The oil they fry their chips in must be very old because every chip I ate tasted like I was just eating a chunk of lard, literally disgusting. The salsa & bean dip was the best part. I had a beef taco that completely fell apart, and the rice & beans were mush. My friend had the pollo fundido w/unmelted cheese. With in the hour after we left the place, we both got sick w/the runs ( think it was the lard tasting chips).  I came back to work, and my coworker said he went last week , his girlfriend got the pollo fundido burrito (same as my friend), and she literally got food poisoning, hurled7 times ! Wish I would have known before going there! It's expensive too, so not worth it. Not Recommended whatsoever! Some Burros is 100 times tastier & it's fast food!",

    "text": "Well...I gave them another try against my better judgement. Since they were close and it was about 8 pm when a friend dropped by and said she was hungry and had noticed the restaurant was close by. We walked into the place and were ignored by 3 giggling gals standing at a register. Finally a guy comes out of the kitchen...chewing on something..I asked for a seat on the \"no smoking\" side of the outdoor patio. At that time he took off like a rabbit to the patio area...tried to sit us at a table that had not been cleaned..which we refused and found a clean one and sat down. The drink order was taken...but no chips or salsa arrived until after the drinks....There was no silverware or napkins brought until AFTER we requested it. Awww yes, finally the \"food\" arrived...a burnt to the bottom of the pan cheese crisp....and a taco....Never an offer of drink refills at all. SAD SAD SERVICE AND FOOD TOO....The last time I ate there I got the meal FREE because the meat was sour in the enchilada ..and the taco had what looked like baby food in the bottom. This place has some serious management issues...or at least I think that's the problem. It use to be a decent place to eat...and the location is TERRIFIC!",

    "text": "Well, we had a good run old friend.  The food has always outweighed the service in this place.  Unfortunately tonight we never even got a chance to eat.  By the time we had sat, made paper airplanes for the kids out of your placemats, ate an entire bowl of chips and salsa, seen nearly a dozen employees stroll past our table, alas, we were never served.  We finally flagged a begrudging server down to find us someone who was willing to take the table and she made no verbal confirmation of our request but walked back to the kitchen to find someone and passed the hostess.  Words were exchanged and when the hostess turned and looked in our direction she began to laugh.  Now maybe, just maybe this was an honest joke like, \"do I have to do everything around here\" kind of banter.  But to us, after a hellish day, and we still haven't fed the kids and it's 7pm on a Monday; it was the straw that broke my wife's back.  She packed up our shit faster than I've seen anyone move and as we got up to head out, a server arrived to wish us a good evening.  Valle Luna is a staple in our rotation but this really was disappointing.  We will take a break for a bit and regroup.  I suggest they do the same.  If you can get service, the food here is great!",

That was a bit uncomfortable considering I didn't think he was joking. I ordered shrimp tacos with flour tortillas because I do not like corn and I still got corn. He could not remember our drink order and came over 3 times instead of just writing it down. The drinks were strong but not good. The food was not worth the price. I would much rather go to Abuelo's where we are never disappointed. I would not recommend this place. My family and I will not be returning.",

They start off by giving you a big bowl of chips and everyone gets their own little bowls of salsa and refried bean dips. I really enjoyed the dips and think I ate every drop of it.  I got the shredded beef chimichanga and I don't remember it wowing me. It tasted fine, but nothing really stood out for me.  The service was another thing that was kinda \"meh\". It felt like we sat there for a really long time before anyone came by to take our drink order and they didn't come by a ton asking if we wanted refills on our margaritas (which were the one thing that was excellent).",

Never had I had a more terrible dining out experience than at Valle Luna. I just arrived in Arizona from NY and took my family to dinner there. Six of us sat down to dine and we went to order. Last year I had the best chili relleno dinner here, so I asked for it again. Sorry ma'am, you have to have a taco instead of the two chilis! Why said I, I don't like tacos, can't you just charge me for a second chili. No substitutions! Just take off the taco and put on a chili, don't you want your customers happy? My granddaughter heard him mumble, for a price and for a price it was! Instead of charging me for one chili, they charged me for double chilis, beans and rice...18 bucks for two soggy cheese chilis! Where last year they were crisp and hot and delicious, this year they were two drowned out soggy cold messes lying mixed in with the beans and rice, drowned in tasteless watery sauce. I asked for the manager and Carlos, the manager came to tell me...tough! We have rules. We don't change things! I said don't you care about customer satisfaction? He said, we have rules! I said I guess you don't care about your customers and he shrugged. That says it all! Tasteless soggy food, nasty manager, greasy plates at the table, uncaring waiter..including the one who elbowed me as I left the restaurant. All this for 118 + dollars. Enter at your own risk! I'm sure there has to be better Mexican restaurants in the Chandler area, or at least ones that actually care about their customers.",

They answered all of my questions. What really had me sold was on the day of the banquet I had an excellent server called Ricky. I can tell Ricky is a pro. He made sure to ask me all the questions he needed to help me make the party run smoother. There was a very small mix up with a menu item we ordered and he resolved it very quickly. Ricky really made the party. I was able to focus on the guest of honor and other party guests. The service was good and the food was excellent. Everything tasted good and there was enough food for everyone. They were even able to accommodation a last minute desert order. I will consider using Valle Luna again for a banquet!",

The front hostesses are total C U Next Tuesdays. We walk in late on a Sunday night after painting and we are tired. Bar is full so we go to leave. The hubs says let's get a table. We ask for a table, not one of their super uncomfortable booths. The hostess tells us there's not a table available except on the patio. It's 45 degrees out. While the staff is sitting waiting for patrons at tables. When I say can't we sit there she just stares at us.  Never going back.",

So with that being said it was impossible to get around to go to the bathroom directly unless you went the long way and then when it came to our food and drinks the older lady that was our server took forever to come over to bring us our food and drinks regardless if it was a soda or water.  Whenever i go to restaurants and am thirsty the servers wont be there to ask if you would like a refill or not. but the days i am not thirsty they are there non stop which is great.  Bad luck maybe.  The chicken tacos were disgusting. The fish tacos apparently were okay. So next time i suppose I should try that instead of the chicken tacos.",

Chicken wings were overcooked and extremely dry. We split a taco basket 1/2 chic, 1/2 beef, very bland, no seasoning to the meat at all. The veggies for the wings were old and dry and obviously old by the fridge burn on them.  It's a great patuo, and the cocktails were good, too bad the food and service were awful.  Lastly it states it's non-smoking outside, there were several ashtrays next to us, full of butts, definitely un-appetizing.",

I ordered the shrimp fundido per her recommendation and it did not disappoint! Heather was genuinely kind and continuously checked on us to assure we were satisfied. She built such a professional and honest rapport, it made us feel like we were dining with comfort and treated like family. That alone will assure that we are making this restaurant a go to for our family for sure! I grew up in California where my family and I would always go to a specific restaurant and my family became a part of their family. I'd play with their kids and they would always welcome us with open arms, and treat us with love and kindness. I even learned how to make tortillas once. This is so important to me as I have kids of my own and want them to experience that same kind of relationship, where even though we are going out to eat, it can still feel like home and we can still dine comfortably. Thank you heather for assuring that these kinds of restaurants still exist, and for helping my husband and I find our new go to restaurant, and thank you Valle Luna for providing such excellent and flavourful dishes!",

Young man came over and gave us the chips and salsa. Then a girl comes over with a high ponytail, says I'm leaving for the night, Gabe will take care of you. She took our drink orders, brought us our drinks moved on to service her tables. About 15 mins later Gabe showed up. I ordered the #2, enchilada/taco rice and beans. I asked if the macacha was really hot. He said, \"It has habaneros in it.\" With sarcasm... I said I wanted green chili chicken enchilada and green chili taco. Oh you can't have green chili on a taco. I said ok, green chili chicken on the enchilada and shredded chicken taco. He repeated me. The busser brought our meals out, gave my plate to my daughter and vice versa (she also ordered a 2 but different meat). We traded and I started digging into the enchilada. It was not chicken, but some pork or beef. I could not eat it. Gabe never came by and I said this is not chicken. Our green chili is pork. I said I asked for chicken. He said, you said green chili. No offer to make it right. No apology for the misunderstanding. I could not eat it. The meat looked gray.  15 mins later, he came by with new drinks and our check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. If we wanted anything more. For that, he got 3 bucks on a $35 bill. I will NEVER be back! I loved this place when it was in Ahwatukee. No more! I'll go to Si Senor first!",

I have eaten here for many years,  even before I was eligible for the special. This place has always been a great stop.

A little trick from a regular: If you don't have time to wait for a table in the main part of the restaurant, grab a table in the bar.  You can enjoy the full menu there.  My only negative, like all large, busy, popular places, it can be a little noisy on the weekends.  Simple solution: Ask for a table on the patio overlooking the lake if it isn't too hot or cold and you don't mind waiting a little longer.  No reservations for parties less than 10, but you can put your name on Yelp's Wait List shortly before you arrive and get seated fairly quickly.  Try it, you'll love it!",

We settled in the lounge to take advantage happy hour drinks with a plan for a nice long evening ending in a full dinner and desert.  It was a hot day in Phoenix, and even hotter inside the lounge.  In the end I was literally about to pass out and had to leave mid meal to go to the car to cool down. We mentioned the heat to the waitress who, much like her services (I won't go into that, but not good), dismissed us saying it was hot for her too.  Frankly it was inexcusable to have the establishment even opened,  and a waste of patron money ordering food that they are unable to eat.  I would have preferred they had closed the doors until they could get their air fixed.",

    "text": "This place is one of our favorite. We are usually there once if not twice per week. But the last 4 times, their service has been horrible. Today we were there for 3 hrs. It took the server forever to come and take our order. We had to call him to get a drink and to get refill on our salsa and chips. We could have had another drink, but the server never came after he dropped our food at the table. We had to get the managers attention to explain what was going on, and all she did, was bring our check. We pay our bill and left. Food is AMAZING, service could use ALOT of improvement. P.S. if your memory is not that great while taking our order, use a notebook to take our order down and actually bring out what we order. Definitely going back for the food and drink. Just hopefully we don't get the same server. And hopefully this review, helps the manager of the place as a feedback of what needs to change if they want to capture customers. Because if we choose to spend our money there, we deserve some attention. We could easily go down the street and give our money to another restaurant.",

Two, the food is definitely not the best Mexican in the area. There are far better places within a block or two.   It's overpriced and definitely not easy on the stomach. We had margaritas, beer, the chicken nachos, and some 1/2 taco baskets. Today, all three of us have some serious stomach issues. The nachos were large (and for $15 they should be) but they had cheese, onions, refried beans, jalapenos, chicken, and sour cream. We had to ask a number of times to get our salsa refilled (there was never enough, and only one brought each time). The tacos didn't taste like much, just deep-fried shells without much flavor.  The ONLY thing I liked was that refried beans are served with the salsa and chips.   Go anywhere else.",

I arrived after the lunch rush and the place was nice and tidy. The decor, tables and booths are very outdated and the dim lighting doesn't help. I was seated in a booth by the window overlooking the outside patio and pond, nice view.   I ordered the chicken fundido with refried beans and rice. The chicken was grilled, nice taste, but the tortilla was over cooked. The beans and rice were what you would expect. The chips and salsa were pretty good but I've had better.   After my meal I wondered about and found the bar area, seemed nice but a little tight seating and yes they had lighting a plenty.   Overall, not a bad experience but not so memorable either. They really need a makeover in their decor, very outdated and just reeked of old! At best 2  1/2 stars.",

    "text": "I had the pollo fundido here, it was pretty good.  I think you would like this place if you are someone who's not afraid of cheese and a little grease to go with that.  Its Sonoran style so U should know that there is gonna be a bit of cheese thrown in.  As for the grease, it comes from all the frying : )    They have pretty decent salsa and chips, but I guess the bean dip does not come standard any more because I did not see them serve that with the chips.  Maybe you got to ask for it.  Food alone should give this place 4-5 stars but the service was a little underpar.  Its not that bad, but certainly was just sufficient without any attempts to improve.  The host was in the midst of seating me but stopped to address an issue with the kitchen on a phone order.  I guess its not a big deal as the bus boys were really fast and would bring u, the salsa and chips and greet u warmly.    As for my server, well I guess she would be a 7/10 service-wise.  Passable but not exceeding anything.  She was in a hurry to put her order in and I noticed her doing the same thing to other customers too.  When the table next to me asked what kind of meat was in their chilli rellenos, she just replied, there is no meat in the chilli rellenos, without any explanation of what it was and if there is an alternative.  The customer got convinced into ordering a pollo fundido which according to the waitress was the same as a chilli rellenos but with a chicken (not really !).    In her defense, she was not rude or uncaring, just very order-oriented and focused on fulfilling them.  She would go around and ask if everything was okay with her charges and did ask if I needed a refill on my ice teas.  I guess its better than a server who would not come around at all, that would be worse.  So perhaps you would want to view the menu online first, using the link on this page and then read about what they were, so you can ask \"educated\" questions about the foods or know right up front what you want, so they can bring you something nice and hot to eat real fast :)  I would come back again if I am craving a nice cheesy (in a good way) meal.  Also the view is pretty good, its overlooking a little lake that it shares a view with Coffee Rush.",

I can vouche for the chili verde pork enchiladas and my grill like there ground beef tacos with rice and beans (they said the tacos weren't as good as what mom and dad make though ;) but they ate it all up.

It is not the employees fault though, this place is always understaffed - especially in the bar area and on the bar patio.   If you aren't in a rush though and can take your time, bring your patience with you and sit on the bar patio. It is right on a lake and the view is beautiful.   I like how the chips and salsa comes out with a couple salsa bowls as well as a bean bowl. That is different from what I've seen at most Mexican food restaurants.   The fajitas are a good choice and are always very flavorful. If you ask for corn tortillas be prepared to wait about 15 minutes for them. Happens to me every single time, even if I ask for them when I place the order.   The guacamole is fresh and cold from here.   The margaritas kind of suck and have too much mixer in them, but they are cheap so I always order them anyway.   This place is great if you have a Mexican food craving,  time on your hands, and aren't picky about your cocktails. The food is always what brings me back.",

I'd promised a Mexican Food Wednesday and I got so wrapped up in the day that I forgot to cook dinner (or even shop for it).  So, we headed to Valle Luna for Family Night.  When we arrived, we were told there would be a 15 minute wait.  About 22 minutes later, we were seated in Gloria's section.  After being seated, we didn't see our waitress for about 5 minutes.  She came up to the table sort of frantic and asked if she could take our drink order.  I asked if we could put in our daughter's food order, since it was getting late and she was hungry.  She told me that she couldn't take the order because she had to go drop off two checks.  Huh?  So she took our drink order and came back with the drinks.  Then she said she would be right back.  Ten more minutes passed and she asked to take our daughter's order.  We told her we were ready to place our entire order, but to please bring our daughter's food out as soon as possible.  I also asked for hot salsa.   After that, we did not get visited by Gloria again.  She made eye contact with me twice - once when she was headed in from the patio and once when she was picking up silverware from a makeshift host table next to our table, but she did not come to our table and just zoomed off.  We heard her say aloud \"oh, hot salsa\" but she never returned.  No drink refills, nothing.  We waited for more than 30 minutes before asking the hostess to find her.  The hostess was under the impression we were just waiting for our check.  We said, no, we had not even been served our food.  We asked for a manager.  Then, Gloria comes to our table, picks up our drinks and asks if we want a refill.  \"No thank you.  We would like to leave.  We have been waiting for too long without service.\"  She said she would get a manager.  We waited another ten minutes and then I took my daughter to the car, letting the hostess know we were leaving and that her dad was staying to talk to the manager.    He talked to the manager and the manager offered to check on our food and comp the food, but it was already far too late and we were in the car.  He said the manager seemed genuine and polite.  We won't be back to Valle Luna again.  I don't know why the waitress was serving both our table and the patio, but that has to be part of the problem.  There is no real team service there, which could have resolved our drink refill issue.    The bottom line is that Valle Luna is just OKAY food to begin with.  They really need to have stellar service if they want to keep customers... and they just don't have it.",

When asked if we could sit by the windows,  she rolled her eyes and pointed at the empty booths available.  Perhaps she should work in the back of the house instead of greeting customers.    Our server, Christa, was very polite and professional! She did a fantastic job and almost changed our opinion of this visit.  Our order was very good and very hot!    We noticed that the lunch hour hostess was training a new employee.  Big mistake, she needs to be retrained herself!  After coming to this restaurant for about six years, this will probably be our last visit!",

We each ordered the fajitas which now cost $16, and we received a plate full of sauteed onions with 4-5 pieces of over cooked meat and a couple of strips of green pepper. Of course we got the usual pile of beans and rice, but we really felt ripped off. We are really disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants has lost its way!",

Was prolly 15 mins before the waiter acknowledged, then about 5 more mins until he came back to take our drink and dinner order. Well 35mins later the food arrives, but during the wait not a single word from waiter as to why so long. The waiter during the meal never checked back to see how everything was. VERY poor service this visit. We go here on a regular basis and we are very disappointed.  We ended up talking with the manager about the server, he was very sorry that we had a bad experience and he took care of some of the items on the bill and offered dessert.  Food as always is very good and we plan on still going there for our monthly Fundido fix,",

Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly! You're better off ordering your meal which gives you their rice and beans...and not waste your money on the $4.25 over charged bean dip.  #MediocreService #WhatWasOnceFree #OverPricedBeanDip #ValleLuna",

Tons of locals come into the place and much of the staff are on a first name basis.  The drinks are great - try the blue margaritas.  The food is INCREDIBLE - try the taco basket (chicken and beef combo) and the wings are legit (try them grilled).  The location is great, you can hang out on the back patio right next to the lake.  A really fun place to watch games - especially for Cards fans on Sunday.  Excellent happy hour and the actually just remodeled so the bar area is a lot more open and welcoming. Check it out!",

I asked if we can be seated while we are waiting for others to arrive.

They looked at each other and the first girl said, \"Well, I guess you could be seated somewhere and when tables open up, we can move you.\" We opted to wait outside where we saw the patio, where our reservation is, located.

Actually they only had tacos as an appetizer and they were lackluster. We tried a dip trio and a chimichanga which were both good and filling. I also couldn't get enough of their complimentary salsa which was really good. Our server, Christian was very nice.   The only gripe I have with this place is the drinks. I had to send back a drink because i could barely stomach it. I don't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible. We tried multiple drinks and all were awful except for a frozen sangria margarita which was ok. I definitely won't be coming back for the drinks but overall he food and service were good and they had a lot of nice patio space. Shame, I live around the corner and this would have been a perfect spot for cocktails and a safe walk home.",

Because I like their thin-cut chips and spicy bean dip, lakeside dining and sea bass that comes with a unique concoction of sauteed vegetables, rice and decent jalapeno lime cream sauce.  The best menu item I've ordered (which I coincidentally don't order anymore because I fear the calories) is the South of the Border pollo sandwich. The chicken is soft, flavorful, and the green chile slice gives it a True southwestern ring. Make sure you get the requisite avocado slices.  One complaint is the drink prices - unless you sit in the (usually busy) bar side of the restaurant, a semi-decent margarita might run $7 or $8. I guess I'm spoiled, paying $3 for a margarita at Salty Senoritas.  Sometimes, I've felt the service was a little under par. A lack of warmth and friendliness, maybe? But most of the waiters/hostesses are young and perhaps don't consider this a career, so I don't blame them for not being perky.  I should note - my family loves this place, and they tend to be picky about Mexican food and atmosphere. Considering the other reviews I've seen about Valle Luna, I'm not sure why my family is so entranced with it. But it has become our hangout each time I'm in the southeast Valley.",

    "text": "THE ONLY PLACE I GO TO FOR MEXICAN!  Let me start off first by saying that there is a server that works there named Jill and she is like this precious, sweet, wonderful lady who ALWAYS knows what me and my boyfriend want when she see's us! We just love her so much! She ROCKS!  The staff there seem to have worked there for a long time which always says a lot to me. The chips and salsa are good - but the bean dip? Oh man! I am in love with their bean dip! The atmosphere is really nice and the view is really nice to (over looks a little man made pond with a fountain in the middle.). Me and my boyfriend always order the same thing - the minnie taco basket, beef, with no tomatoes - and we always walk out stuffed and happy. They use shredded beef that is so juicy and flavorful!   Sometimes I am disappointed with the wait staff because certain servers aren't really on top of things, even on a slow day. But, my boyfriend and I don't let that impede out love for the minnie tacos and delicious bean dip!  I will be a patron for forever (or least until I don't live in Phoenix anymore)!",

    "text": "The lake view is what brings my friends and I to this place for an occasional dinner. Place gets packed so we try to come later than the prime time dinner rush. That really works best on the weekend when the hours of operation are a little longer. So... I've tried a lot of their dishes - Fundidos, Shrimp Enchilada Dinner, etc but once I tried their Shrimp Stuffed Poblano Chiles - that was it! I could never try another dish off their menu. Like the pathetic and predictable crack addict that lives for the next hit I come here and predictably get that each and every single time. I mean it comes with everything I love - shrimp, calabacitas, chiles, melted Monterey Jack cheese and jalapeno-lime cream sauce. So Valle Luna, don't you ever ever ever ever ever take that off the menu or I will walk out of your restaurant for the last time ever after throwing a tantrum that would have even embarassed John McEnroe back in the day. One valid complaint that I'm not alone in (judging from OTHER reviews) is they stopped serving the bean dip with the chips. Now it's just the blander salsa that the chips come with. And now they charge a kidney for the beam dip if you still want it. Well not really THAT much - it's more like just a big toe or something. But they used to give it for free as part of the complementary chips and dip. For that I dock a star - since that awesome dip was a mandatory part of the complete Valle Luna experiece. Lots of parking - shares a mall with Nate's Third Base, Sprouts, Hon Machi Sushi, Coffee Rush, and Pita Jungle.",

I had a green pork burrito with beans and rice. Everything was super tasty. My daughter had the cheese crisp extravaganza which she loves...has tons of steak and grilled vegetables. Their Polo Fundito is also excellent, the cream cheese sauce is perfect, not too hot. Really didn't have anything bad. Servings are huge so you will have leftovers for lunch the next day!!   There is a lovely outdoor patio that would be really nice when the weather is cooler.   Will definitely be back soon!!",

    "text": "I am opening a day spa practically right next to this place so after hours of meeting contractors, taking measurements, etc. in our currently empty space my wife and I were ready for a margarita and some good food. So we decided to try one of new neighbors and I have to say that we were very impressed.   The inside is beautiful with wood beams and little False roofs that make the atmosphere cozy. Of course, the lake is right there which also adds to the atmosphere. Margaritas were $5 on Mondays, which we were happy about because that was number on our list that day. The menu had lots of great choices but we decided to just order two appetizers. We got a mixed mini taco plate and sliders.  Both of our choices were first rate, not greasy, and were served quickly. We thought the service was exceptional. A manager was walking around checking everything the entire time and was actually the one that asked if we wanted a second drink. I always like it when managers are hands on with customers.  My only negative is that one item we ordered was more expensive than we thought. The menu we looked at was for the cantina only, not the main restaurant. Apparently, the cantina has its own specials. I thought that was confusing for a new customer but I don't think they were trying to be misleading at all so I would not knock their rating for that. It was really our fault.  I noticed most of the negative reviews here are old. I thought it was excellent so maybe they changed.",

Sadly they were out of salsa verde which is totally my favorite part. I ordered the Port Verde which comes with rice and beans. The sides were spot on but the Pork Verde was a bit bland. My friend ordered a combo plate with a tostada, enchilada and crispy taco. Unfortunately, his instructions had been forgotten and the tostada and taco had ingredients on it that he couldn't eat.

It takes some serious work to mess up tacos rice and beans in my opinion but Valle Luna more than succeeded. Way too overpriced for the junk they serve. All I wanted were two veggie tacos and i got the greasiest hard tacos ever that were falling apart with refried beans from a can and not a vegetable to be had. Rice was tasteless and horribly mushy. We will never be back. Honestly I wish that I had complained but our server was too nice and we were so intent on leaving that I just did not...save your wallet and your stomachs and skip Valle Luna!!",

We described the plate that we had eaten and he instructed us that we needed the green chile chimis. We got the Vallitas and Lunitas as an entree, crispy chicken flautas and bean/green chile/red chile chimis. I got the numero Uno. Chicken taco was juicy and crispy and crunchy and the flavor was just right. Green chile enchilada was piping hot but I could not stop eating. Rice and beans were done right.   The real winner of the night was desert. Carlos undersold and over delivered. The fried ice Cream was not the usual rock hard interior. This was the right size to fry the outside and just soften the inside. Not only do you get the best fried ice cream but cinnamon fried tortillas AND caramel cheesecake stuffed chimi.   We found our new favorite Mexican food. Well done Carlos and thank you Valle Luna.",

I did some research and read some reviews of friends and thought ok, this is going to be a good place!  When we 1st got there they put us in a small booth, we were sitting on top on each other, the 21 yr old is 6 months prego and they placed us in table where it was very tight and making her uncomfortable and I had my left handed son sitting next to me elbowing me already and the food hadn't even arrived yet (s/n: I really think he sits by me to bug the crap out of me) so we asked for a bigger table and we got moved almost into a small booth on the other side, my daughter said yea that's not going to work, that's what the other one was and it hurt to sit there, so we were moved to a table with the view of the lake, it was nice, felt like was in a different area then just chillin in chandler   It was happy hour when I arrived and it was Three-O Thursday, all Three Olive Vodka drinks for 3 bucks, so I ordered the Cherry Smash, it was a pretty drink, but way too strong for me , I know I was even shocked I couldn't finish it!   The chips, bean dip & salsa arrived to the table, now to me the chips were not that bad, tasted ok, some of the reviews said it was the worst part of it, to me they were ok, the salsa on the other hand reminded me of pace picante, one was sweet and the other was just like tomato sauce, packed no heat what so ever, but the kids liked it and ate it.  Ok I'll just tell you what they ordered real quickly:  21yr old ordered the Tamale Dinner, she loves tamales, she thought the flavor was good, tamale itself was a little dry, but it cured her caving.  19 yr old ordered grilled asada burro dinner, she loved it! This plate looks like something I should have ordered, she loved it!  16 yr old ordered southwestern chicken breast, he didn't care for it, he said the chicken tasted like I cooked it, meaning it looked great, but was dry, sometimes I just wanna smack him haha  After reading everyone's reviews, I was really looking forward to what I ordered, I ordered the Fundido, I understood that it was deep fried, but mine looked and tasted like it was left in the fryer for way too long, the tortilla was inedible, I scraped everything out of it and left the shell on another plate.   The beans & rice were good, and so what the filling inside the tortilla, the jalapeno-cream cheese could have had more heat for, but was very good. I don't think I will be ordering this dish again.  We were having a good time talking with each other and decided that we wanted desert, so 2 of us ordered the fried ice cream and one ordered the chocolate taco. I was one of the ones who ordered the fried ice cream and I chose caramel for topping instead of chocolate, and I asked if it could be drowned in caramel and it was ,,omg it was soo delish!!!!!   I do want to come back to Valle Luna to give them another try, the kids did enjoy themselves and the food, so they are willing to go back with me.",

    "text": "Recently I decided to have a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend, and being that she and most of her friends are Mexican I wanted a place with good food. She is from Sonora, and the restaurant is described as Sonoran-style, so I put it at the top of my list.  I spoke to someone a few weeks prior who gave me additional information on private parties. They offer three different levels of menus for large parties. In selecting the Sonoran Celebration I picked two menu items and it came with rice, beans, a zucchini dish, and chips & salsa. Unlimited soda, tea, and coffee also come with that option. I had half of the patio overlooking the lake, booked it for 5pm with dinner served at 6.   I arrived a little early and had the opportunity put up decorations and set up the cakes I brought. While I was doing that two staff members were busy setting up the food line and brought me drinks. As the guests arrived they were offered drinks and chips & salsa while the food was being prepared.   The setting was perfect, my girlfriend surprised, and everyone reported having a good time. They enjoyed the food and as I booked for 35 but didn't have quite that many show up there were some leftovers that we brought home. It was a good choice (thanks to those Yelpers who provided suggestions on my Talk post), and I will definitely visit again.",

I got it about a week or two ago and was hoping to enjoy it.  Went there with my companion and liked the surroundings and the lake view.  Was expecting a great experience.  But, when I went to order I was shocked that the server said the coupon expired last December (2013).  This was September 12 2014 around 1pm at the Ray road site!!!  The server said he would have to check with the manager and this was the second one he had seen like this lately,  I should have known I was in trouble when he never came back for a long time.  When he did, he asked if we ready to order as the manager was busy right now and he wanted to see if we wanted to get our order started..  I said I think we better wait until we speak to the manager as the coupon is what brought us in.  Eventually the manager came by.  She said that there was nothing she could do as the expiration date was clear on the coupon.  I restated I just got it in the mail in the past two weeks so something must be wrong with your advertising department.  She said she didn't know how I got the coupon but, it was out of date and she could do nothing for us.  We then left and went to Charleston's and got wonderful service and great food.",

I ordered tamales, my favorite, they were as hard as rocks, so dense and heavy and unpleasant.  The rice was blah.  My daughter decided that rather than order from the kids meal, she would order a 1/2 price happy hour appetizer.  The happy hour menu was standing up in the middle of the table for all to see.  When we tried to order off the appetizer menu, we were told that those items could only be ordered in the bar and that the server was unable to accomodate us.  I decided to go into the bar and order the appetizer to bring back to our table.  On the upside, the bartender was very helpful and said that it was fine, nothing worng with bringing it back to our table and then offered to bring it to us when it was done!  So helpful!   We were very  disappointed that the server was so unwilling to help us solve the problem.    We went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good.  Don't know why we took it home, it just ended up in the trash.   I guess we'll continue our quest to find the best Mexican food restaurant!",

Unfortunately the patio was full. If you get a choice, ask for a table outside overlooking the water. It helps the so-so food go down better.   Pros: Big portions, lots of cheese, good service.

We were seated promptly after the wait and  fresh chips and a slightly watery salsa were provided. The atmosphere is very family friendly and has a view of the Andersen artificial lake. My wife had the shrimp/pork  combo fajitas and I had a red chili/machaca chimi. Both were served with ample sides of rice and refried beans and were very tasty. The draft Amber Bock and  Dos Equis XX  were fresh & cold. They were out of draft Modelo.  We split a flan for dessert, which was average. My wife also ordered flautas for next day lunch. We have eaten there many times over the twelve years Valler Luna has been open and the Sonoran food is consistently good. It is a bit less hot then I prefer, but does hit a happy medium for most people, There is outside deck seating and a nice bar area.",

I can't stand refried beans. Got it home and it is the most horrible thing ever! I was given refried beans the chimi was disgusting. The fundido sauce was IN the chimi which normally  just goes on the outside which it was as well. The steak had absolutely NO taste/ seasoning except the fundido sauce.... Will never order take out from this one again. I am not taking it back because it's hot outside and don't want to drive all the way back again. Not worth the $17 + $3 tip I just gave.",

    "text": "I rarely leave negative reviews but yesterday's experience warrants one. My family and I have never been here before yesterday. We decided to grab lunch to celebrate a late Margarita Day. The issues began when almost immediately:  1-my mom is elderly and walks with a cane. The hostess took us up stairs without asking if she could navigate the stairs. I thought this was thoughtless. But we soldiered on because I heard great things and we had a coupon.  2-our waiter introduced himself and was obviously stressed. He mentioned that he was super busy with another party. This is okay and I only mentioned it because I think it reflects on management issues. When we walked through the restaurant ppl were not working as hard as our waiter.  3-the food was not good. The food was lightly warm and not great. It was edible but not close to the rave reviews I heard.  4-coupon issues. We ultimately chose your restaurant because we had a coupon. I presented my coupon as did others at our table and it caused an unexpected ruckus. We were told you could not accept our coupon in a digital format. We took pictures of our coupon. Your coupon has no language that requires it be presented in paper form. The manager was hostile and unprofessional. She tried to place the responsibility of the issue on us the guest. She raises her voice and was rude. She allowed us to use on coupon but made it clear she wasn't happy doing so.  She actually yelled us for insisting you honor your coupon.    I slept on it before leaving a review. I don't like leaving bad reviews but it was such a negative experience. It left such a bad impression especially for place in Chandlers.   Ultimately the food was descent with subpar service and lacked quality management. I would recommend taking a few extra minutes to go to Macayo's or Elmer's.",

    "text": "Decided to give this place another try because my friend suggested it for the margarita special. Monday Margaritas for 99 cents! I'm there! However, I was disappointed once again by the lackluster food. I ordered the burrito special on the lunch menu that was about $8.50. When I got my food I cut into my burrito and took a bite expecting a mouthful of flavor but instead all I got was the taste of reheated shredded beef. I asked for the sauce on the side, which is probably what they use to cover up the reheated meat. I complained to my waitress and she apologized and offered me something else and I said no I just want it taken off my bill. I told her I would eat the rice and beans it came with. Then the bill came and she took the $8.50 burrito off my bill but charged me $2.50 for the measly side of rice and another $2.50 for the tiny bowl of beans. Are you kidding me? Your burrito was awful and you still charged me $5! I had to wait for her to come again to complain about the charge for rice and beans that a toddler wouldn't even get full on. She said she would talk to the manager. She came back with my bill once again and he took off a $2.50 charge. I work in customer service and any common sense would say you don't charge the customer at all....but I guess that is lacked at this restaurant along with flavor.   If you read Valle Luna's reply you'll see what I mean by lack of customer service....",

The food took a long time to come out and the waitress did not check on us to refill drinks or anything. We probably waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out. That seems like a long time for a lunch rush. Overall food is good, and typical, value was on the average side.",

Our server was right on the ball with getting us waters and menus.  He made sure we got the chips and salsa to tie us over as the place was packed!! 2nd mention.  We got our order in right away and only had to wait about 20 minutes to get our food.  We didnt order off the happy hour menu but there was plenty to choose from.  My order wasnt correct when I got it but were in a time crunch so didnt want to wait to send it back.  I ordered a combo plate with all chicken and ended up with ground beef :(  Taco fell apart, enchilada was all cheese and the tamale was the worst I had ever tasted.  My daughters ground beef enchiladas were less than par also.  Definately not the quality of food we were hoping for.  Unfortunately cant rate it very highly.  Maybe if we went during a non-happy hour time would have been a different experience however I'll go with my instinct to not go back to try again.   Great service, just poor food.",

Then no bean dip with the chips...okay we ordered it.  Not the same bean dip, runny and not tasty.  The service was less than ok. The food was not what we had before.   Our waitress did not even visit our side of the restaurant, other servers in the area practically had to be tripped to be asked to have our server come by.  The manager came and got our drink order.  Wrong beer, and no waitress in sight.  Will have to savor the memory of years gone by.  Won't be going out of our way to eat there again. Have much better places close to us.  Very sad.",

All she said was, yeah nothing compares to home made. We ordered the tamales they were dry and had almost no meat in them. Our waitress said they wouldn't be dry if we put the sauce on top. But if your cook could make tamales correctly we shouldn't need sauce to make them moist. The best part of our meal was the rice. We spent 40 for a plate of nasty tamales and good rice. We will never be back. If your smart you will not come here any hole in the wall Mexican restaurant is better than this dump. Too bad really we live close and could have been regular customers.",

The food is disgusting; bland, overly salted, and greasy are the best words to describe the 4 dishes my party ordered (and that includes a taco salad)! The meat on it smelled like dog food. I assumed when I paid extra for steak it was going to be big decent pieces. Nope. It was like weird Taco Bell meat cut into tiny cubes the size of raisins. In all honesty I should have just gone TO Taco Bell instead of wasting money on this food- especially since the dressing I asked for on the side came in a plastic take out container. When I am paying to sit down, please don't serve me anything in crappy plastic containers. The margaritas were terrible as well! Watered down, way too sweet, and pretty much see through. I also asked for a salted rim and was given this weird sugar mixture on it instead. This overly sweet drink they tried to pass off for a margarita might work well at a sorority house but not as a restaurant that boasts being voted the top Mexican Food in 2014. My two thoughts on that:  1) According to who (because whoever decided that doesn't have tastebuds) and 2) HOLY CRAP how Valle Luna has gown down hill in just 2 short years.",

We had to sit at the far west end of the restaurant patio to avoid the smoke blowing over from the bar patio. So apparently we must risk lung cancer to get the discounts. Because of that I won't go back. I experienced breathing problems when we sat inside the restaurant a few months ago so that is not an option. Why can't anyone get the discounts even if they are not in the bar or bar patio? Isn't that discrimination? Parking is always horrible there too.",

It's this delicious pulled beef/chile combo stuffed inside a giant,  cheesy quesadilla. Heaven. Eat it with the mexicali relish and it's game over. Its the only thing I order. Love the bean dip and chips, too.   Service can be a little hectic,  but I've seen most of the waitstaff always just hustling and bustling all around so I think that's why, and I'm fair when taking that into account. Maybe add some staff to take the pressure off? Wait times suck during peak hours (Friday night, for example.)  It's certainly not gourmet but it hits *the* spot when you get that naughty-bad-for-you-good-for-the-soul-craving for Mexican food.",

My grannies were thrilled to see the 2 for 1 deal for senior citizens-the place was flooded with happy 'n' stomach-crammed senior citizens-we were waiting for them to leave and tables to clear up. I can understand some of the bad reviews, but the restaurant has been there forever, since I was born, and it's good enough for a big group who aren't very picky about Mexican food. A neutral place in hope to satisfy everyone in the group as there are alot of selections on the menu. I was lucky to have had an amazing vegetarian tamale called \"Tamale Dinner\" (with green chili corns), and apparently, it's one of their specials. I finished the whole plate-the rice and beans were delicious, and I was surprised to leave without an upset stomach (mexican food=be ready for a screwed up digestion function). I wish we sat outside as there is a nice terrace with a man-made lake view.",

We arrived just prior to the evening rush, and were quite surprised by the staff's lack of prioritization skills as we sat in the entry at least 15 minutes while others who arrived after us requiring seating for 5 were seated before us. When we inquired about this, the hostess proceeded to seat us near the smelly restroom, with other suitable booths in plain sight. Unfortunately, the odor overshadowed any quality of food that may have been there. Needless to say, my husband and I were mortified by the staff's haphazard treatment, especially since we had recommended the restaurant so highly to our guests. Valle Luna used to be our favorite local spot, but I doubt it will be on our short list of preferred places to go the next time we are asked to recommend a restaurant. We are very disappointed since that evening was to be the last get together before one of our guests deploys to Afghanistan.",

If you want Americanized Mexican food with many fried things or drowning in cheese you will like it here.  There was a ton of cheese on the salads (iceberg lettuce), twice as much as other places that do lots of cheese.  Got the shrimp stuffed poblano chiles - pepper had nice flavor and shrimp plentiful and nicely cooked but again a ton of cheese that overpowered the dish and could not taste or see other ingredients.  No lime crime sauce - maybe cheese buried it or it was forgotten.  Friend got chile rellano - it was ok but nothing special and again lots of cheese.   The meals could have been much better with small changes (use Mexican cheese not American cheeses), don't drown things in cheese (covering up a dish not that good?).",

    "text": "4 friends enjoying mexican.  We walked in around 8 o'clock on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table outside.  At first glance, I prob. wouldn't have eaten here.  It was in a strip mall, and really not appealing from the outside.  There was a glow of the red light reading Valle Luna, and neon writing on the glass windows advertisiting the specials and NFL ticket (it's not football season).    Anyway, we had good service and the food was great.  Pros: I loved the chips, salsa, and black bean/refried bean dip they gave us for an app.    The portions were HUGE!  I suggest splitting or come prepared to take home.    Outdoor seating  Neat canopy like booths and tables inside, transporting you to another place  $20 off $60 coupon  Fajitas were able to come with two different meats for no additional charge  All food was really hot (temp wise).  Cons: One of the frozen margaritas came out not blended.  The fruit was on the bottom, still whole, and the ice and booze was taking up the top of the glass.  Our waitress, Jenni, had no problem bringing a beer in place of the unsatisfactory drink.",

It may just be a pond across from a condominium complex but it really gives you the feel that you are sitting outside drinking margaritas with a palm tree over your head with good Mexican food. they said us out on the patio and it was amazing because we had no idea that the restaurant had been split in half and the bar and seeding is on the left, and the restaurant is on the right. The restaurant was very quiet and very nice to sit and have a relaxing drink and eat your food. But, the bar was jumping. And I would have much rather sat on that side because it was like a big Cinco de Mayo party and everyone was having a good time and I think it was on a Thursday we were there. If we go back? We're going to sit on the bar side for sure. So I won't leave a tip but I will tell you pick the bar side the music's fun that people are fun and the drinks are flowing. but remember when you leave the place you are in the middle of the city and you are leaving a shopping mall drive carefully.",

    "text": "I felt like having traditional Mexican food and this is it! We have been coming here for years. A local favorite in Chandler.   You start with fresh chips and salsa brought to the table (they used to serve a bean dip as well, but not anymore).The salsa is thick and chunky. All of the house favorites are amazing. I had the chimichanga dinner with red chili in the chimi. So good! It is served with rice and beans, sour cream and guac! Wow! I washed it all down with a refreshing Frozen sangria margarita! Perfect way to start the weekend and end a hectic week.  The kids are not big fans of Mexican food and that is okay. They have burgers, fries, mini ni I corn dogs and chicken fingers for the non-Mexican eater. Only problem, small kids portions so make sure you order a quesadilla app or extra chips and salsa to keep them satisfied.  If you are interested in outside seating and the weather is nice, this is a great place! The outside patio has a view of a local Lake and water fountains. It is calm and peaceful, perfect for date night or just a quick Escape.",

I would have rather spoken to one in person and not yelped it, but our server Brian would not get the Manager. I have been coming to Valle Luna for over 20 years and the Chandler location has always been my favorite. Their Pollo Fundito is usually made to perfection. I've honestly probably consumed at least 300 of them. I like them so much, my wife is now hooked on them, and we have been coming here at least 3 times a month. As noted in my previous review, its almost always a 5 star experience. Our last visit was on Tuesday July 17th around noon. Brian was our server.   My wife and I ordered our usual meal, 2 pollo funditios and a kids cheese crisp for our toddler. When the meals came, I immediately noticed that my funditio did not look right. It was somewhat flat and not fried all the way. My wife's looked great. Side by side, the two looked like completely different meals. When I took the first bite, I confirmed my suspicion that the fundito was not fried well at all. It was soggy and like a raw tortilla. Furthermore, there was almost zero cream cheese in it, and very little chicken. My wife's was fried to perfection, but had way too much cream cheese in and very little chicken. I dont normally complain, but for a dish costing in the $15 range, I expect at least borderline consistency and quality.   I had only taken 2 bites of the meal and then sat for 15 minutes waiting for a server or manager to come by. Brian eventually came by and dropped off the check. When he asked if we enjoyed the meal, I began to explain the issue I had. Before I could get two words out of my mouth, Brian said that my Fundito did not look right, and that he was surprised because Valle Luna takes so much pride in that particular dish. I agreed with him and said it just wasn't up to par... and the worst one I have had in 20 years. I kindly gave him my debit card and felt relieved a bit that I was able to voice my issue. Brian came back a couple minutes later, tossed the receipt on the table and disappeared. Nothing was taken off the bill. Not even an offer to have the Manager come by.   I hoping it was just a hiccup. However, this place has rightfully earned a great reputation in the valley, and service like what we experienced will ruin decades of great food and service in a matter of months, and that would be a shame. For the record, had a Manager come by the table or a new meal been provided, I would have happily paid full price for everything. Unfortunately neither was offered.",

Why does it always smell like a restroom when you walk in the building, also? Then, we were seated and it took 15 minutes to get drink orders. We made our orders and told our waitress we had two birthdays the day we went. She didn't acknowledge us. We waited 40 minutes for lukewarm food. It was the burrito bowl and it looked like it was last night's food reheated. The black beans did not look \"authentic\", but rather straight out of the can and set under the warmer. It I had a spoonful of chicken in the whole thing. It was awful. Never once after we received our meals were we checked on for refills or any other necessities. There was plenty of staff running around but, I'm not sure where they were running to. This was so disappointing as many people have said great things about their food. This was a lackluster experience and tasteless Mexican plate. I won't be giving it a chance again anytime soon. Oh! And you can't even find a place to park without circling about 20 times.",

Awesome Tomas, the bartender, was welcoming & friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. It's been a week and my mind is still dwelling on.. the tacos. Dude slings cold beer, wine, and eye-openningly tasty salsa and food. {Tacos, tacos}  Call me simple (you wouldn't be the first), but if your Mexican joint has subpar Taco- or Salsa-game... it's a hard pass for me. Fortunately, that's no concern here. {Tacos}  Valle Luna has stellar tacos and salsa. Grab a telescope. Point it to the Heavens and on a clear night you will see them up there. Alternately, just drop by Valle Lune and behold the bounty. Even their mini tacos are substantial. The regular salsa is very tasty, and their hot salsa has a memorably flavorful zing. Holy moley I'm in love with this place. {Tacos... em-effin tacos}  We also got the Bandito Burritos (mini bean burros, deep fried) and a cheese crisp. They were OK. The cheese crisp was more chewy than crisp and I could have done without the deep frying of the little burros. But I was on such a stratospheric high from the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G TACOS that my review is getting all wrapped up in 5-STARS for me. {Oh, the Tacos}  Throughout this review I have liberally strewn a consistent subliminal message that should prep you for your Valle Luna culinary adventure. {T-A-C-O-S}  I envy you the fresh discovery. {haunting whisper... tacos}  Big Thanks to Jesse for getting me Tomas' name. Credit where credit is due baby!",

I'm someone who has been (and is still currently) serving for 10years and the servers here just don't have it. The greet is boring, no enthusiasm.. my drinks (even water) ALWAYS take forever... I'm really not trying to sound like \"one of those\" people and I typically wouldn't write a poor review on a place- but this is a constant thing I have dealt with coming to this location. I will continue to come here because the food is great- but the service could definitely use some improvement.",

She is friendly, professional and kept up on our refills. I enjoy seeing her as she always has a smile on her face. Food was great.  Fresh and hot. Absolutely delicious. The reason I am giving only 4 stars is because the AC wasn't working. My home AC was out so I was hoping to enjoy dinner in a cold restaurant and when we sat down it was muggy humid and hot. I asked Danielle what the issue was and she said they were working on it earlier but didn't know what the problem is. I think these restaurants especially in the heat of the summer need to make sure that they service  their air-conditioning units and keep the restaurant cold and comfortable. That's the main reason why people go to restaurants in the hot summer is because it's so darn hot and we want to be in a cold environment.  Restaurant itself with food and service deserves 5 stars.",

    "text": "Valle Luna is a reasonably reliable Mexican restaurant.  Nothing spectacular, but reliable.  The food is pretty good, the menu has a good variety of \"classics\" (burros, chimis, fundido, etc), the chips and salsa are fine.  Nothing spectacular.   Service is reasonable, and the prices aren't bad (especially if you get a coupon which shows up sometimes in those coupon clipper magazines).  Obviously I'm not raving about this place.  I would put it on par with Garcia's or Serrano's.  Not great, but not bad.  Nowhere near the level of someplace like La Tolteca.  But it was closer, I have limited time for lunch, and I had a coupon.  One thing I will say is they support youth athletic programs.  They have numerous plaques displayed of the various teams they have supported.  Girls' soccer, boys' baseball, etc.  A LOT of plaques.  It's cool that Valle Luna takes an interest in their community like that.  Many places don't.  Has nothing to do with the quality of the food, but when choosing between comparable restaurants like Garcia's and Serrano's, I think it is nice to know I am helping support such things with my patronage of the restaurant.",

It sits right on the water so when the weather is nice the patio seating cannot be beat.   Every time I have been here the service is always excellent.     The food is great.  I usually order the Machaca Burro De la Casa with rice a beans and each time I am left satisfied.  Also just in case you prefer Black beans instead of Pinto or Re-fried.  Those are very good as well and have become my preferred choice of late.    For me personally this is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in the area and I would much rather drive here then each at Nandos which is closer to my home.    The only downside for others who have been here in past years. . They used to offer you bean dip with your chips and salsa, but not anymore.  Now they will charge you $4.00 as if its an appetizer dish and while it is good, for me it isn't' worth it.   Other than that, enjoy the food and the view.",

Second, the tacos were fairly tasteless and fell apart because the shell was drenched. Third, the enchiladas has black olives. I'm an Arizona native and have had Mexican food a couple of times and I don't recall of many places putting olives in their enchiladas.   In the end I may go back, but it won't be for a while.",

    "text": "I have experienced the best of Valle Luna in 3 very different settings; the typical dinner dining, happy hour, and special event.  Those situations get 4, 3 and 5 stars respectively which averages out to a solid 4-stars.  The food has been consistent all around.  It's much better than the Mexican drive-thru's, not quite as good as Globe food, but pleasing with no surprises around any corners.    Happy hour and the dining room have completely different atmospheres and service.  The dining room was a typical Mexican food restaurant feel, with decent service. It was quiet and the tall booths make it easy to forget about other tables nearby.  The bar (the only place you can get happy hour deals) is loud, crowded, hectic and has had questionable service.  Not horrendous, but I think the servers are stretched too thin.  Getting refills on drinks that come with free refills seems to be a recurring issue... getting a second beer or margarita is not.  The happy hour appetizer menu is hefty enough to serve as dinner, which makes for a good cheap meal!  I'll put up with the bar environment for 3 tacos for $4.  I cannot say enough good things about the private event I attended here...the disclaimer is that I didn't organize it, so I don't know how the back end was.  My future in-laws planned our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding, and Valle Luna proved to be a perfect venue.  We were out on the patio, right on the water.  It was mid-April so the weather was perfect. The set-up was functional.  Everybody loved the food.  All props to the decorating go to my mother in-law, but Valle Luna was on top of their game with service, ID'ing the appropriate parties, and making the whole event appear seamless to the nervous bride.",

It's definitely a step closer to legit Mexican food than some other places, but there's really not much here that you can't get anywhere else.  I will give a thumbs up on the happy hour.

She came to us and asked my husband if he wanted a Bloody Mary! Um does he look hungover! He said no thank you what kind of soda's do you have and She had to think and said Pepsi products but couldn't name any other then Pepsi. He said 2 Pepsi's please and she actually made a face and rolled her eyes and gave him a dirty look for not ordering alcohol I guess.  Packed parking lot, you will have a little walk. Dirty Menu's, dirty seats, dirty window ledge with straw wrappers and the green thing that they wrap utensils with and bugs.... Flying bugs. dirty table. Just plain dirty everywhere.  It was 11am, it was 90 out and the shades where down with at least 20 dead flying bugs of all sizes so I asked our waitress if we could open the blinds, she said she has to find the manager came back and said he said we can't open blinds because it's to hot out. Um we were at the end in a corner outside was Palm Tress that provided shade and the Patio provided shad no sun in sight. WHAT HAPPENED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Even Denny's will open the blinds for their customers. I Guess  CUSTOMERS DON'T MATTER! You would think with so many BAD Yelp reviews mainly on the rude staff they might want to change. So we had to sit there in between a dirty wall and a filty bug infested shade. Just DISGUSTING!!  They cater to those who drink, I saw other waitresses literally run to help those who sat in Bar area.  We weren't asked if we've been there before, we  weren't asked if we wanted to sit Bar or Patio.  1st Pepsi came out Syrupy 2nd Pepsi was watery. How do you mess up Soda?  Now the food! Me being Spanish I make Spanish Rice weekly and I know packaged flavoring when I taste it. They should take the fake Rice off the Menu. Beans, well you can't mess those up, I like all beans even canned. Yeas I'm a Beaner.. No complaints on the Chips and Salsa seeing that most of the workers are not of Spanish decent so I figured it wouldn't be spicy and it wasn't  I got the Sonoran Enchilada they should change the name to Sonoran Sopes. It is not with Corn Tortilla it is with Sopes which is very thick. It needed WAY more cheese and a thinner sauce. The dry old Olives ruined it and I love Olives, but it was okay, it will get you full you should try it if your really hungry. The hubby got The Lunatic which is a Potato Pancake. I like his a little better good sauce. The Potato tasted like they mixed it with gravy which that I didn't like.  My advise is if you want to see the view sit in the Patio.  I will give this place another try and sit in Patio area it was my experience that was bad not really the food, come with an opened mind and don't expect to much, lower your standards maybe you'll be surprised.",

    "text": "Ay dios mio! Valle Luna has been a favorite of mine for the 10+ years I've lived in the valley. This place is classic Mexican dining.  Our most recent visit, we ordered the #4 combo with shredded beef-pork tamale, taco, whole beans w/rice and the asada taco dinner with refried beans. You can also order black beans here which I appreciate.  Now idk if it's the rebel in me, but anytime a waiter/waitress brings my plate and heeds the standard \"this plate is very hot\" warning, the first thing I do is touch the plate! What's hot to you?? This is one of those places where the plate is HOT! Our food is always fresh, even with larger groups, here.  We also like to frequent this location for the Happy Hour specials. Their house margaritas on the rocks are one of my favorites and the appetizer deals are too good to pass up. We enjoy the mini taco basket w/shredded beef or chicken, mini chimis, cheese crips, Mexican pizza with jalapeno cream cheese... so many options to choose from!  It's also worth saving room for fried ice cream with strawberries or chocolate.. drool!  There's a great view if you sit near the window or on the patio and plenty of parking, although you'd be surprised with how quickly it fills up.  I docked a star because service can sometimes be slow. This most recent visit, the napkins on our placemats looked dirty already and the menus needed a wipe down. :/ also, I miss the signature bean dip they used to serve with the chips and salsa!! BRING FREE BEAN DIP BACK!   Overall, this is a Mexican restaurant you wouldn't want to pass up trying!",

    "text": "My usual Mexican food spot was closed today. I had visited Valle Lune years and years ago and figured I would give it a try. To start, the salsa is the canned tomato kind. I'm not a huge fan of that kind or else I'd just pick it up from the grocery store. The entree I got was a taco and enchilada and the enchilada came out looking like a burrito. The taco was just a taco. My husband ordered the fundido which sounds like a chimichanga with cream cheese sauce. The jalapeno cream cheese dip was not jalapeno-y at all. Again, it's the soggy, canned jalapeno taste. The beans were too thick. Hard to dip my chips into and didn't have any amazing or specific taste. Even the Spanish rice wasn't good. Most other places, the grain is softened and flavored. The rice grain they use was harder and didn't retain much flavor. My husband loved the dollar margaritas and there were a ton of people in there!!! They have patio seating next to the lake which would probably be nice. I wouldn't visit again. Didn't do it for me at all. And price per entree for location was shockingly high. We also got the potato skins and there was just too much meat on them. The cheese was separated from the potato which also doesn't do it for me.",

If you're thinking the restaurant was crowded, you'd be wrong. Something going on for sure here, and I hope they get it fixed. No apology, no drink refills, no mention of any issues. Sad.

The hostess told us we could order the sopapillas  with just honey, (the way we wanted them) and come pick them up. Why would we order through door dash if we wanted to go pick anything up? We have eaten at Valle Luna and the food is good, but shortly after we ordered our food, we received a text our order had been canceled?? We ordered from Nando's through door dash and had no issues.

    "text": "After my dreadful experience, over a year and a half ago, at another location, I thought I was done with this long time valley chain. However, our recent experiences at their Chandler location helped me rethink my negative view.  We were meeting up with my daughter and my new son-in-law, and were at a loss as to where we could eat that was interesting. They suggested that we dine at Valle Luna. Despite my hesitation, I didn't want to downplay their selection. Hence, we agreed to meet up there.  It was a Friday evening, and the place was packed. My daughter had made reservations and opted to have us sit at the patio.  The view was quite marvelous. The restaurant faced a manmade lake with a fountain. The surroundings were quite serene and aesthetic. It was good so far.  We ordered several dishes.  They were the Enchilada combos, the Steak Fajitas, and the Sonoran Steak (their specialty). I will say that unlike my previous experiences wherein we were given food that seemed doused with chili pepper to hide the lack of flavor, these dishes (we always share as a family) were quite appetizing.   The steaks were cooked to perfection. The fajitas were spicy, but not overly so, with hearty grilled vegetables and meat. The  different enchilada sauces on the enchilada combo were appetizing, to say the least. Gone were our previous overtly spicy dishes. They were replaced with palatable dishes that were expertly prepared.  The great service we experienced was also well worth noting. Our server was prompt, and cheerful. Although it was a busy evening, he maintained his composure and cheerfulness. He didn't let us go too long before checking in on us.  To top it all off, their Flan dessert had a wonderful texture to it. The caramel was light, and not burnt.   After this marvelous experience, we have opted to return several more times for various other get-togethers with family and friends.  This place has definitely restored my faith in this long running chain.",

The EMTs were called as her head was bleeding.    I sincerely hope the management will take note of this.   My friend spent several hours in the ER and is requiring ongoing medical care as a result.

Drove almost an hour to sit in a dingy table with broken plates, horrible watered down or machine made margaritas, and surly waitstaff.  But that is not what  prompted this review.    About 7 hours after eating there I became violently ill, and have been weak for 2 days...the bad stuff...where you get to know your bathroom pretty well.   2 of us had a mid afternoon dinner with 1 drink each with tacos, Sonoran enchiladas and a pork mexican pizza for a bill of 60.00.  Was not given any happy hour prices, although in their advertised time frame.  Waitstaff was so inhospitable I didn't even want to argue with them.  They never offered more salsa or chips or even asked if we wanted another drink (we didn't) So I figured at least I'd have left overs, not so, as everything  went to trash. My partner did not eat the pizza so we suspect that's what it was.  So unless you want to revisit your meal over and over and over again, then the pharmacy, do not go there.",

We were quickly seated (it wasn't as busy as it had been in the past 2 or 3 visits.) Our server (Brian) was at hand quickly to take our drink orders.  We requested water with lime and inquired about beer that we would like when our meals were served. After he returned with the water, we ordered our beers. Chips and salsa were delivered to the table.  The chips were very fresh and light.  The salsa was amazing!  Just enough \"kick\" and very flavorful! Salsa was replenished with additional napkins. Our dinners were served in reasonable time ... Lunatic Huevos Ranchero and Grilled Chicken Fajitas. Both smelled great and tasted just as great! Eggs were perfectly done ... veggies and chicken were perfect! Brian served up our beers right after we received our food as requested.  He kept track but was not hovering.  We appreciated that! He did ask how everything was and if we needed anything.  (NOT \"How's the food tastin'?\") I'm pretty fussy about clean tables, utensils, etc.  Everything was fine. To be honest, this is the best experience ... best food, best service ... we have ever experienced at Valle Luna . So, whatever changes have been put in place over the past months, in our opinion, are working! We'll be back!",

LESSON LEARNED to RESEARCH Restaurants better especially when with guests! Would not recommend at all! Only place worse is Garcia's. Service was very lackluster. There were also 3 people glued at front desk. Called good day without moving to assist me with opening the door after seeing  my immobile broken arm as we left.",

The ticket is up I just came to see if they ran it out.  They didn't!  That was at 40 mins.  The chip n salsa girl came by 15mins later and asked us if we wanted more chips.  No would like our food.  She then went and got the server who came back with another excuse.  I get it she had a big party across from us.  They had plenty of food and complaints.  At least they got their food.  Spoke to the mgr she said the cooks can't get it together back there?  What was she doing about it?? Nothing - she said I'm sorry as she was pushing out a catering order.  Funny the restaurant didn't come to a screeching halt.  There was no sense of urgency to fix the situation. She said the server is back there yelling at the cooks?  What are you doing??  I guess we weren't that important of a patron to her.   Would have left zero stars, but that isn't allowed",

Well not impressed at all, they have some hostess at the front to seat you, not pleasant at all, seems like she hates her job. Then we sit outside then our order got messed up because our server didn't write it down to begin with. Then the food quality just so so. Not sure what happened if they sold it to new owners or what. Or their kids took over but the food is not good anymore, then they changed the green chili to make it hotter. WTH it was good to begin with that's why people come back. We decided after this last trip, not going back.",

As we were waiting for the bus boy to finish the table we stepped aside and excused ourselves out of the managers way and he what we thought was jokingly commenting he didn't want to go into the bar because \" he didn't want to actually have to do work.\" He wasn't  joking we barely saw him the rest of our time there. Our server seemed out of it from the time we sat down, we planned on being here for awhile so we paced ourselves and didn't mind waiting for drinks or food knowing it was busy. Once we were ready for our second round we had to look for our server for over 30 minutes since she wasn't checking in (again we get it's busy but really) once she finally came back she seemed completely put off but us and the fact that we wanted more, again we waited more the 30 more mins to try and order food. It was extremely hot and overly crowded, they couldn't even get the game on  in time and were using customers phones to stream it. Highly disappointing since we expected to have a great time watching he game with other fans.",

We were seated outside, chips and salsa were brought promptly. We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for service. A server named Will noticed about 10 minutes in and promised to find our server for us. Another 10 minutes passed and I went to let the hostesses know that we hadn't even been greeted yet. At the 25 minute mark a table was seated next to us and were immediately greeted by Cassie, who I can only assume was our server since she was waiting on every seated table around us. She made eye contact with members of my family several times but never acknowledged us. At this point we decided to leave and stood up. Again, Will noticed and began profusely apologizing. He talked us into staying, immediately brought drinks, took our orders, and discounted everything. He is the only reason Valle Luna has any of our money, and they won't be getting anymore of it. The food is underwhelming, and aside from Will, the service is terrible.",

We were a last minute party of 30 and Christian was assigned to take care of us.  In all of my years and all of my different restaurant visits I have never experienced service like we had last night.  We always receive great care when dining at Valle Luna but I am still amazed and we haven't stopped talking about Christian!  All 30 of us ordered cocktails, dinners, split dinners, kids dinners and separate checks.  In other words, we weren't an easy table.  Christian did not miss a beat!   Drinks were refilled and ordered before current ones were empty, all orders came out correct and not a single bill was wrong!  I still don't know how he accomplished this!  To top it all off, one of the kids fell out of his chair and Christian had an ice pack to our table minutes after getting him back in his seat!  We were stunned!  We didn't even ask for it!! We often receive great service here but we have NEVER had service like this.  Managers, please give Christian kudos for a job well done and tell him how valuable he is to your establishment!  Thank you Valle Luna and thank you Christian!  The Thomas/Felice family!",

Therefore, the bar side patio is much busier.  Very popular place among the chandler residents. Fun atmosphere.   The happy hour is reasonable, but the selection is bar food.  I would recommend the bar patio for those who want to enjoy a drink, watch some sports, and grub on some wings and papas fritas.  I would recommend the other patio for a more relaxed feel- maybe if you have young children.  The patios are beautiful, because you sit over looking the man made lakes Arizona has. Water is relaxing even if it is man made.",

We hit this place up on a Sunday night about 6p.  We had to wait about 10m and then were seated at booth inside with a view of the lake.  Our server was MIA for a long time and then all of a sudden she almost popped around the side of the booth and asked for drink orders (She never really stopped and stood and talked to us, just popped in and out). At some point a basket of chips with salsa and bean dip came out, which was great because it took FOREVER to get food - we ate every chip!   I had the chile relleno, black beans and rice.  It all tasted fine, but it had no spice, good flavor just no heat.  Oh and another thing about heat, it must have sat back there awhile before the waitress could get to it because it was warm-ish.  So it was all fine.  Not bad, not great. A-OK seems about right.    The only thing I can rave about was the frozen margs. They were a perfect amount of slush and booze!

The location of this place is really nice, situated on a lake in the corner of a large complex. For some reason, I like how they are set way back in the corner and their front door is not immediately in front of you at the curb.   I've only been here twice, and I sat in the bar both times. Got pretty decent service, refills took slightly longer than I like but it looked like our server was the only one running around the bar and she was prego, so I'm not really going to fault her. Plus she was super sweet.  I'll be back because of the notable perks I have experienced so far:  Mmm, warm beans. Yes please! They have good happy hour specials, even on weekends (the mini burritos are YUM!)  And they have Michelob Ultra on draft.",

We were very pleased.  It was a Wednesday night, which is Family Night. It was very busy but we were sat immediately because we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  The patio is PRETTY AWESOME! It looks out onto a precious, good sized pond which makes for a tranquil setting.  To make the experience even better there are ducks waddling around making you smile.  Service was a tiny bit slow but they were busy and I've been a server before so I know what's up!  Our server was awesome! He was sweet, informative,  positive and laid back.  We didn't mind at all about the lax and longer wait times because the atmosphere rocked and we were having a great time.  The food was great! We had the trio dips for an appitizer. The guacamole,  chorizo con queso and the cream cheese jalapeno.  The Cream Cheese Jalapeno is delicious as well as the guacamole.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Chorizo Con Queso but I had never had that kind of dip before. My man said it wasn't the best he'd ever had but still good. We had the chicken and steak fajitas and the fundido!  Both delicious! The Fundido was definitely worth it!  I also had a Cadillac Margarita.  It's tradition for me to get a Margarita on the rocks with salt and a shot on the side due to the margaritas not being strong enough. I want to taste the tequila and I'm a Lil bit of an alchy.  Anyway....I got a Margarita with 1800 Silver and a Grand Marnier floater with a shot of 1800 on the side.  The Margarita was so strong that I didn't even need the extra shot! Impressive!  We love the place! Definitely worth the drive and we will be back soon!",

We advised our waiter Harry ahead of time that we were on a work lunch break and if we could get our check with our food. Asked for Togo boxes with our food those never came had to go get them. Our checks were not ready had to wait on. My taco of whole bean rice and lettuce was wrong sent back then still wrong. And for one taco it apparently cost $4.27. When I wanted to changed my form of payment from a card to cash I was snapped at by Harry for messing up his order there were 3 cards there including mine. At no point were we ever apologized too for the late food. A sorry about that would have gone along way. The other girls said the food was good but would never go when your in a hurry.  We were at lunch for a special occasion and it was dampened by the poor services we received!",

    "text": "Literally the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted in my life ( until I went to Macayos!!!)  So now its the second worst Mexican food I have ever had.  We had an appetizer that was overcooked or over deep fried little tasteless burritos that were supposed to come with a bean dip that didnt come til we were done with the appetizer.  When we asked for the missing bean dip our waiter got a bit defensive about it.  It was so bland and tasteless anyway and we didnt eat it. We had a chili relleno that was just awful.  It was swimming in oil, a thick slick of oil.  Very weird feeling in your mouth.  I almost vomited literally but instead I spit it out in my napkin.  I had a combo burrito and taco and the taco was in the deep fryer so long that the edges of the meat were black and the cheese they stuffed inside never melted so it was a weird combo taste texture.  The burrito was about the best thing but still the worst I have ever had.  There were lots of tiny pieces of what appeared to be red peppers and green peppers as well as onions in the meat mixture but it seemed to be old as if it had been in fridge or left over a couple days.   Someone else said that the beans were like play dough and yes thats a good description! The chips and salsa also not that good.  Salsa wasnt the worst but not that good and was definitely not fresh or made by them and the chips were so brown they were almost burnt.  The waiter was a bad mood jerk.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful with the lake and the fountain all lit up at night.  Gordon Ramsey really needs to make a visit to this place.  I cant believe they are in business since 83 and that people recommend this place.  What are they thinking????",

The shrimp fajitas need more shrimp and less onions taking up room on the plate (sneaky sneaky). Good salsa, great bean dip, and delicious enchilada sauce.",

    "text": "Although Valle Luna used to rank high on our list, my last visit there has caused me to boycott this restuarant.  I will summarize the story, as I don't like to draw out details.  I am a very forgiving and patient person but this incident was truly an example of extremely poor customer service.    After my mother passed away, my friend gave me a Valle Luna Gift card.  Eventaully, because it was emotional, I used it with my family.  After I tried to pay using the gift card, the waitress returned to tell me that the card was not activated.  I asked to speak to the manager and she advised that she would look into it on Monday.  2 weeks passed and I decided to follow up on it.  The manager than had conflicting comments, but bottom line, she cannot do anything to help me unless I have the receipt.  I explained, as I did the night we dined there, that I did not feel comfortable asking my friend after 3 months of receiving the gift since the chances were very low that she would still have the receipt.  Also, it made me very uncomfortable that if she didn't that she would then feel bad.  In short, the manager advised that if they honored everyone's gift cards that were not activated then they would be out of business.  She basically was accusing me of trying to use a stolen gift card.   I asked her to please check with the owners to make sure they agree with her decision to do nothing.  She did email the response saying that there is nothing that can be done and oh, very sorry for your loss.  (talk about salt in a wound).  A little more background:  We have been a very loyal and regular patron of Valle Luna for as long I can remember, well over 10 years.   On average we spent $1200/year there.  So, we have spent at least $12,000 over the past 10 years.  Value of the gift card:  $30  Interesting business model employed.  And this coming from a restuarant that has buy one get one meal coupons abundantly.",

It's bland in the way that wholly Americanized Mexican food always is, and the ambience of the place isn't really appealing either. The people who only wanted chips and drinks looked like they were having fun, but I can't speak from experience on that. The view of the lake is kind of novel in this area, but you're really only looking out over a big pond at some apartments, which gets boring very quickly. In short, I'm not really sure why anyone would want to go here, I'm pretty certain that regardless of what you're looking for, you could easily find better nearby.",

The food was delicious, in fact, i was a little uncomfortable for a few hours since i drank and ate so much.  This was our first visit and we will be sure to return, definitely want to sit on the patio by the lake when the weather gets better! Thanks again Tomas for the fun afternoon.",

The food doesn't isn't close to having the authentic flavor, however if you know that going into it, you're going to enjoy your meal.  I love their appetizer list, which includes mini tacos, mini burritos, a tasty Mexican pizza, and more. If you're looking for a meal, the chimichanga, fundido, or Pepe's sizzling fajitas are all good choices.   I love going to Valle Luna for happy hour. They have daily drink specials, half price appetizers, and a nice little lake to sit next to.   Above average food, friendly service, and a great happy hour gives Valle Luna an above average rating of four stars.",

Waiter seemed like he had a long day, not the friendliest we have ever encountered. He was quickly replaced due to his shift had ended, and replaced by a very personable young lady.

K and I split a 1/2 Taco basket all beef ($4.50) and the Chorizo Queso ($4.50). The taco's are pretty good. A good amount of beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and a slightly greasy shell. For a buck fifty each, no complaints. The Chorizo Queso was a bit disappointing. The queso was a bit runny and just didn't seem made correctly. I like the plain Queso much better and will return to it the next time we're here for happy hour. Awesome server, decent h.h. food, good h.h. prices. 4 Stars.",

It was two soggy tortillas with refried beans, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese (which is shockingly bland and salty). I would rate taco bell higher than valle Luna. Everything is over salted.  The menu descriptions make everything sound amazing and delicious. I think hiring a professional menu author (or whatever the process is) is the only thing keeping them in business, besides the location. if you dine in, you may find the place dark and depressing. Employees reflect this vibe as well. I don't think I'll be back, even with all the coupons they send out every month in the clipper.",

Abundant chips and salsa with an appetizer of guacamole. Made two ways, one regular and one hot.  We chose Fajitas, Chili Relleno, and chicken enchiladas.  Larges portions, most (but not all) staff were friendly , and good value.  Outdoor seating with view of lake...perfect for the cooler evening.  Moment of humor: one colleague ordered a drink of Baileys Irish Cream on ice. Order was met with disbelief. Two people came out to double-check that's what he really wanted. Guess they don't get too many orders for this stuff.  PS Can't say how Valle Luna compares with other area Tex-Mex...but infinitely better than anything in NYC.  Would return. See pics.",

I don't know if the hiring pool is just awful or this place hires good employees and just have the worst leadership....the 2nd is the food used to be good .... used to be..maybe they are going through tuff financial Times or they are under new owners/management,  either way the food is now bland and the quality falls below Taco bell ( at least you know what your getting with taco bell) ...last time I was there the bartender spent more time with his buddies than taking care of paying customers and worse management didn't care.... my overall advice is to stay away...I would have given them a worse Rating but 1* is all they get....Try    DOS gringos or Nando's If in  Chandler...",

The chorizo dip tasted like nacho cheese from a gas station with pieces of something that didn't taste like chorizo.  The burrito fundido again tasted like they melted a Kraft singles piece of cheese on top of it.  It is missing something to balance out the taste.  Plus it was super salty.  Menu needs a revamp they need to seriously look at cutting it down and get staff that really focuses on quality.  The appearance wasn't too bad, but taste is seriously lacking.",

We waited a long time for our food (nothing we ordered was particularly complicated), again, and when the majority of the food came, my boyfriend's meal did not come and they got my best friend's order wrong. They told my best friend they would bring the item she actually ordered and never did. My boyfriend's meal, which evidently had not even been prepared, came 20 minutes after everyone else's.  One would expect some acknowledgment of the profound errors and delays, but the apologies were minimal and cursory. Then, to top it all off, when my friend got her bill, there was an extra drink on it, and when she brought that to the server's attention, the server admitted she had overcharged and was aware of the error but brought the bill anyway, as if it were just a minor error.",

The chile relleno cheese wasn't even melted -- gross. And the chile, I couldn't even cut through it with a fork. The egg batter was smooshy. Yuck. Worst relleno I've ever had, including the microwaved crap you get at the 'bertos chains. (If you like chile rellenos like I do, go over to El Zocalo -- awesome relleno). The enchilada was good; however, the enchilada sauce was super salty, I mean like they salted it way too much, then salted it just a bit more.  We also had the albondigas soup with salad. The meatballs were undercooked, red inside. The salad was right out of a bag.  Even the iced tea sucked.  The place has such a nice ambiance and a great view, right there on the water. I hope our experience wasn't the norm.",

The atmosphere of this restaurant is nice especially if you get seated by the lake view tables. I have to say I was a little bit turned off that we were given dirty menus from the hostess stand. Someone was slacking. Salsa all over. But the service and food did make up for it.  We had a buy one get one free entree coupon which was happily honored. Our waiter was very nice and kept our drinks refilled and checked in with us often. I had a cheese enchilada and a chicken flauta. My fiance had a shredded beef and bean burrito. Both meals were very tasty. The enchilada sauce was great. The enchilada had just the right amount of cheese.   We had a good overall experience. There may be a few other Mexican restaurants in town that are a little better but I enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend Valle Luna.",

    "text": "I have been going here for a year and a half, about 2-3 times a week.  I have learned not to expect good service or good quality of food.  I came back always because of the patio.  But as far as service, it is lack luster at best, as you can see by other reviews.  We sat there for about 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged by our server who walked by several times.  We placed an order for Carne Asada nachos with drinks.  When we were eating the nachos we realized there was almost no chunks of meat on them, which cost $15 for nachos.  The cuts of meat were 1/8 inch in size and a very sparring amount. I considered this meat dust.  When telling the waiter this he just said that is the way it comes.  So the manager came over and as this was discussed it became apparent he didn't care either.  He wanted to take a whole $5 off the bill.  Maybe if I was back in Junior High $5 would have been a big deal.  I don't go out for a celebration and get concerned over $5.  What I am concerned about is the dining experience I have.  This place will always be busy, cheap drinks, average food and a good view.  So this won't make a difference in who goes there.  But this is the only recourse in having yet another bad dining experience here, for which I became accustomed to. I will attempt to find another Mexican restaurant to enjoy going out to.  I know, I only have about 300 other options.",

It was late so we sat in the bar area.  Big mistake!  I felt like I was in a dance club, the music was blaring so loud.  I can get past that.  What I can't get past is the type of music that was playing.  I actually had to ask my husband if I'd I heard correctly.  Yes I did!  F-bomb dropping all over the place!  Very hard rap with very harsh lyrics.  I was completely shocked that my favorite Mexican food restaurant would allow music in their establishment that would have such harsh words in it.  I ended my very lovely date night with my husband very angery and I have Valle Luna Mexican Restraunt to thank.  So Thank you!  We could not get out of there fast enough.  The only reason we stayed as long as we did was the food.  It was as delishes as always. But the food does not make up for my dining experience and will not be back.  2 lost customers.",

Like ur kidding right. And the food took forever to come out and a) wasn't good b) forgot to put one of my family's items on order (props to the manager for taking that item off bill) but honestly shitty service I won't be returning. It seemed everyone's food was taking forever Bc no one had their food and we all had been waiting forever. Ironic Bc it wasn't even busy LOL food was terrible my brother and boyfriend got the same item and they came out looking completely different, quality was inconsistent. Location is all this place has got but don't waste ur time I'd rather eat Taco Bell.",

Their Happy hour goes until 7:30pm which is the longest Happy hour around. Also they have daily specials for margaritas and specialty drinks(prickly pear marg is the bomb). $2.75 pints and $8 pitcher of domestic beer on HH too.  This is going to sound strange but they have the BEST GRILLED WINGS!! I would have never thought to try them, but we smelled some as they went by and had to order a dozen. They were SO tasty and flavroful! And from a Mexican place?  We haven't tried the burgers but we heard from other people that they were good too.  The Pork Verde is super DELICIOUS, and HUGE!  I really haven't had anything bad from Luna either. We are here often and each time we always see a new magic trick from Chewy - the awesomest bartender!  The service is quick and when something comes out wrong, they quickly remake the item and it's out without 5 minutes.    The patio has the best view of the lake too since it's in the center. They have tons of TVs, fenced the ducks off the patio, misters, both pubs and tables. It really can't get much better.  I mean, maybe if they had recliners or something but for now I'm all positive and give Valle and big thumbs up!",

However, I'm a medical sales rep, and we bring A Lot of lunches to offices.  Usually I try and steer them towards healthier fare since I have to eat lunch too, but one of my better accounts had a particular fancy for this place so I decided to be accommodating and give it a whirl.    I ordered their party platter which feeds 25, and told them to just put an assortment of stuff on there, beef and chicken.  My total was $125 before tax, and I found this to be EXTREMELY reasonable for what I got.  They were a little slow getting my order brought out to my car, but yes, they did bring it out and load it up and I only gave them an hour notice so I won't fault them for this at all.  It was a TON of food, two huge bags of chips, 3 large containers of salsa, 1 large container of guac, 1 large container of sour cream, a tray of rice, another tray of beans, and 3 huge party platter assortments of mini chimis, mini tacos, and flautas.  Even though the food was fried, it was not terribly greasy, and I actually enjoyed it!  It was a huge hit with the office, and there was so much leftover I actually brought some back for the staff at one of my offices since coincidentally they were having Mexican potluck day and as usual, I forgot to bring something in.  They commented on how good it was too, even though it was a full hour later and I looked super thoughtful ;)  I would definitely recommend this place for other reps who do catering orders or anyone who wants to feed a large group for what I consider to be a very fair price.  Huge hit, something for everyone!",

    "text": "I have been Valle Luna in the past and was not very happy with the food and service.  I said I would never go back yet, I decided to give it another try this time when I had friends in town. Once again completely disappointed with the food and service.  I had called ahead to make reservations for a party of 6 and was told they only accept reservations for 8 or more. Okay, I let that one go. We get to Valle Luna the waiting area is not busy at all. I place my name and party size with the host. He did not give me a wait time, just says,\" okay, have a seat.\" We waited 30 minutes before I finally had to approach the young man to ask how much longer. He said, \"we are still waiting for tables to clear.\" We wait another 5 minutes then  finally are taken back to our table. First we are seated next to a table with a family with 4 kids, all of which were behaving badly running around screaming, no one said a word to the parents or kids.  Our waitress, Krystle promptly comes to our table to take our drink orders. This is when her poor waiting skills come into play. Krystle never approached us with a smile, a hello, welcome, just a \"what would everyone like to drink.\" She returns with our drink then asks if everyone is ready to order. We all order. I personally had the spinach enchiladas. They were not good to say the least. The description mentions the enchiladas being filled with spinach, tomatoes, potato and zucchini in a blend of cheeses. These enchiladas should have been called cheese enchiladas, that is what they mostly consisted of. I saw the finely chopped pieces of spinach amongst the cheese sauce. However, I never once tasted or saw a potato, tomato or zucchini at any time while eating this dish. It was very bland and again I felt as if I was eating a tortilla filled with Velveeta cheese sauce. My husband and friends were not entirely pleased with their meals either. They all said that the food was okay but too pricey for the quality.  Back to our waitress, Krystle. The worst waitress I have ever encountered while dining out. She could have been more pleasant, and attentive. We had to flag her down on more than one occasion for drink refills, extra salsa, etc. Each time we asked her for something she acted as if we were inconveniencing her. We didn't receive even a thank you from Krystle at the end of our meal. I will NEVER go back to Valle Luna and will not recommend to anyone.",

The Chicken Fundido is one of my absolute favorite menu items and I have not found another Mexican restaurant in the Valley that can beat it! The jalapeno cream cheese sauce is TO DIE FOR!! The chicken in the fundido is actual whole grilled chicken breast, fresh and cut up..not the shredded soggy meat that you can get everywhere else. They give you chips, salsa and bean dip before the food comes.   The Happy Hour prices for Margaritas aren't great (around $5.50) but they taste great and I usually only have one for my entire meal. I go to this location at least once a month and the longest I have had to wait to get a table in this establishment was around 5 min. They have a bar area, restaraunt and patio which makes for a lot of seating. If you sit outside on the patio you will be on the waterfront where there is a cool fountain and some ducks that run around.   The prices compared to other good Mexican restaurants in the Valley is about the same. You get what you pay for though...quality food. I took my whole family here for my college graduation and every single person loved the food. My mom is not a huge Mexican fan but she is hooked on the taco salad!",

DELISH! We were seated promptly and with a smile! The waitress was also attentive (making sure our glasses were full) yet not overbearing!   I had the tacos i could barely finish one but thats because I ate EVERYTHING! :)  A great place for a nice hot meal and a place to converse with your company.",
