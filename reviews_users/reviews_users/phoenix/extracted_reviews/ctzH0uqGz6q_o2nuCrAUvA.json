Actually, I don't know sushi.  I just thought I would say it to see how it felt.  Not good.    In fact, I'm not a sushi lover, and there was a time I wouldn't eat it at all.  But it's grown on me.  Although I've yet to graduate to sushi rolls with raw fish as the main ingredient, I have moved to where I can handle a little tuna as long as there's some other stuff in there to hide it.  But even this non-sushi eating diner finds some good things on the menu.  My favorite roll of the night was...well I can't remember the name of it and their website is down...I think it was the shy guy or something along those lines.  And with that, I conclude this exceptionally useful review.  I guess I should take better notes, or any notes for that matter.",

    "text": "I went here for dinner with a friend while on vacation in Scottsdale for a week and a half after someone had recommended it to my friend. I'm ALL about sushi but honestly had no idea what kind of sushi place this would be.  I ordered the miso soup and three rolls. The soup was great and I really enjoyed all of the rolls that I ordered. What's nice is that Sun-Th you can order smaller versions of some of the rolls (5 pieces vs. 8 pieces) for a fraction of the price, which allows you to try more. Two of the rolls I ordered were tempura fried, but in a different way than I had ever tried before. It was more like the rolls were coated in breadcrumb-like crunch rather than a full on deep fry of the roll, and I liked it because it didn't feel like a heavy deep fried sushi meal.  My friend ordered the vegetable tempura and really liked it. She said the same thing about the crunch as well--different but really good. She also had sashimi and enjoyed it, but that's not my area of expertise.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars here is because the service was slow (didn't see a server for 20 minutes at a time when we actually had a question or wanted to order or get the bill), but I hate to completely tank a rating based on one service experience, especially when I see other reviews about good service.",

I ordered the salmon teriyaki and the further you ate away from the teriyaki sauce the saltiness on the vegetables became noticeable. The salmon teriyaki was moist, flavorful, and dangerous. It wasn't properly deboned! I stopped eating after the 3rd bone jammed me in the gums. I would have said something before my bill arrived, but no one checked in after I encountered the bones. I told my waiter, but it didn't seem to register or he didn't care. The tuna sushi I had was melt in your mouth delicious. The only saving grace of this trip. Btw, this place should be 3-$; my entree and 2 sushi pieces over $30!",

They don't use too much rice on the rolls, and they give you a good amount of ingredients in each roll.  They don't over-sauce, which is so nice, as many places do as if they're apologizing their sushi tastes like fish!  We've liked every roll we've tried, but our favorites are:  Marilyn Monroll Candy Cane The Roll Monster Roll Fire in the Mouth Prince of Persia",

    "text": "I love the \"Fire In The Mouth\" roll with jalapenos (also tried the Marilyn Mon-roll which was good as well and comes with a rice wrapper instead of rice and seaweed if I recall so it's a \"lower carb\" option.)   + They have a nice small sized house salad with wasabi in the dressing.  + At lunch they gave me a free miso soup.  + They sell Asahi Dark which is one of my favorite beers and you rarely see it.  + Friendly staff.  + Very conveniently located near a Sprouts health food grocery store so you can run other errands and they probably get some of their produce fresh from there.  + The low carb sushi rice wrapper idea is inventive.  I live near Japantown in San Francisco and I can tell you that this place is very good.   I tried Bei (also near Scottsdale) a few months ago and didn't like it as much but I think they'll probably do ok because they seem to appeal to a younger crowd that just doesn't know any better.    When I travel outside of San Francisco/Japantown I miss eating Japanese food and I always try the local places but usually end up disappointed. I find that most Japanese places outside of major urban areas are not that great...for instance, I ate at 3 Japanese places outside of Baltimore, MD last month and none of them were very good.   In short, if you are visiting Scottsdale from a big city and you are missing good Japanese food you will like Sushi J. Dinnertime seems popular but lunchtime is more quiet and slower if you don't like crowds - the restaurant is a nice cool dark break from the heat outside.",

I love their tootzy, crunchy bay, and dynamite rolls.   I will say this has been the only one of a few sushi places where I haven't liked their variation of the Las Vegas roll. Too smoky. Ah well..you win some, you lose some.    Every 4 or 5 times Im in they will be severely understaffed with one waiter taking care of every table in the place,  otherwise Ive always had great service.   I've been here numerous times and as its within walking distance of my home and I predict many more delicious dinners between SJ and myself.",

Sorry Lisa Loeb fans but you all can finish it yourselves! Haha!  Sushi J is a little hot sushi spot located behind the scenes of Oldtown.  Sushi J provides a warm cozy welcome compared to the buzzing night scene.  I came here with a a couple of good friends.  Needless to say, I've known chef Jay for quite some times and it was good to see him again behind the sushi table.    We started with some edamame and sake bombers to wet our palates.  As for the entree we ordered the Marylin MonRoll, Geisha Roll, and the Prince of Persia.  The Marylin MonRoll came as a rice-less roll; wrapped with rice sheets and within Lobster mix, cucumbers, avocado, mango and cilantro.  Overall, reminded me of a spring roll with lobster, but a solid start since if anything I'd rather eat a rice-less roll - low carb!  The Geisha was a regular rice wrap and came with crab meat, cucumbers, shrimp tempura and topped with tuna and avocado; served with yuzu and Siracha sauce.  I would say this was my favorite of the night because I always enjoy a crunchy and spicy roll.  The Prince of Persia came with Ahi Tuna, avocado, green onion, tempura and served with ginger garlic sauce and Siracha.  Again, a crunchy and spicy roll which I love, but this one had that extra garlic aroma and bite to it.  I came back a 2nd time with a foodie friend of mines and this time we shot for the Sushi Omakase tailored to our price point.  Totally awesome!  Our omakase came with Uni roll, a spicy tuna hand roll, and a plate of sashimi.  I totally love the Uni Roll; creamy to the bite and a burst of the taste of the sea.  Our sashimi came with Yellowtail, Yellowfin Tuna, fish liver paste, tuna belly and scallops.  Overall, a solid dish and I can't say enough about each bite.  Fresh as can be and and seared to perfection!  In the end, I really enjoyed my visit to Sushi J.  I think it's one of the few better sushi joints around town and plus I live close by!  The service is good and the amount of specialty sushi is  plentiful. - Enjoy!",

I will order that every time we come to Sushi J.   The Marilyn Mon-roll was just ok. However, the Prince of Persia roll was full of flavor and really good.  The Scotty Roll (soft shell crab) was really  good.  The service was excellent. Prompt. Our server, Kevin, was very knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations.",

I thought the sushi was pretty good, but a bit pricey and the sushi rice was a tad too sweet. The quality of the tuna, salmon and scallop were great and I loved all the seared/torched nigiri we tried. Our server was almost too attentive, but he kept our waters and teas full so I cannot fault him for being friendly. It's good sushi but not the best sushi I've ever had, but so far, it's the best sushi I have tried in the Phoenix area (which isn't too hard, with a sample size of three). I'll have to try to the new place for comparison and report back.",

    "text": "I was really excited to check this place out, had it bookmarked for a while and finally got around to it. The venue is clean with a classic Japanese feel and a sushi bar with Itamae that greet everyone coming in. The reviews I previously read were solid and I had a good feeling when the server came and  we could place our order.   I was with a friend and we started of with a miso soup and seaweed salad each, coupled with the hot sake, I believe they only have the one type of hot sake(good value for the price). I LOVE seaweed salad, and this one was really great! Afterwards we ordered some salmon nigiri. I'm always a bit picky with my salmon since I come from Scandinavia, and if there is one fish I really know, it's salmon. I was extremely pleased with what I received. The quality of the salmon was really top notch, as was the ratio of salmon to rice.  The bulk of our dinner was comprised of the maki we ordered next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, we came on a Tuesday in order to take advantage of the \"happy day\" rolls. We ordered the eel tempura roll, Alaska roll, crispy cali roll, and the tootzzy roll. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with what I received. All rolls had a very similar consistency and taste. The majority of the maki was simply a \"smear\" of crab/mayo and the Alaska roll only had a minimal amount of salmon.   All in all, I'll give the place a 4. This is an average of 5+ for the nigiri and the seaweed salad, but a weak 3 on the maki rolls. If It didn't come across, all the rolls we picked came from the \"happy day\" menu.   So, in conclusion (wow this was a long one), I would come back due to the AMAZING salmon nigiri and seaweed salad, the venue, the atmosphere, and the reasonable price. Maybe I'll try the \"full priced\" rolls next time. However, I won't be ordering any of the rolls I already tried!",

Every time I go in, they are busy, but I have also never really had to wait for a table.  They only have one area that I have seen that can be used for larger groups as they mostly have little tables.    My favorite rolls are the Monster Roll and the Lord of Tuna Roll.  Everything is amazing though!  I have ordered most rolls and I would recommend pretty much anything. The non sushi dishes I have had a more limited experience with, but  again everything I have tried was very very good.",

The ambiance was quiet and the decor was straightforward, nothing too crazy to report on those fronts. I ordered a couple of my go to sushi rolls: a spicy tuna roll, a salmon roll, and something pretty adventurous, a roll topped with scallops, crab salad, mushrooms, and misago. It was excellent! Pricing was about what you'd expect, about 15 dollars a person to get full on sushi alone. Definitely check this tasty place out if you're in the area!",

Food quality is super; the salmon sashimi is absolutely exquisite. But where \"J\" sets himself apart is with his supremely creative rolls. I'd suggest a particular roll, but we normally just ask him to be creative so if they have names, we rarely know what they might be. He has never let us down. Delectable and beautiful. The ambiance is homey, warm and friendly. We have a couple of very nice sushi restaurants close to our home, but we find the drive to Sushi J's well worth the effort.",

I've been lucky enough to experience good sushi around the world as well.  So when somebody at the hotel happy hour told me about Sushi J's, I was sort of thinking \"yeah right.  400 miles from an ocean, I'm sure it's great.\"  But the Yelp reviews seemed encouraging so I decided to check it out.  HOLY COW!  The fish was fresher than most of the placed I go in Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, etc.  Places that are spittind distance to the LA Fish Market.  The service was outstanding as well.   Now I'm not a guy who orders a roll that \"looks cool.\" I order sashimi off the special board and have fairly high expectations.  A cute name on  a roll is NOT going to win me over, but yellow tail toro so fresh it was probably swimming early this afternoon surely does.    Over the past decade or so, I've had some decent sushi in the Phoenix area, don't get me wrong.  But this place is in the top 5 I've ever eaten at world wide.  San Fran, LA, NY, Chicago, etc.    Yeah, I'm still high on my sushi buzz and you can be too.  I just really hope I can find an excuse to get back to Scottsdale soon to eat hear again.",

Eventually she figures it out and we receiver our 2 Shirley temples. I asked the young girl what kind of vegetables are in your chicken teriyaki? She had to really think about it.  She tells me it has mushrooms, carrots, bell peppers, onions. When I get the plate of chicken teriyaki it's full of veggies and hardly any chicken. For $11.99?  what a joke. Then they charge $3.99 a piece for Shirley temples.",

Had the Tootzzy Roll, Eel Tempura Roll, California Roll, and Dragon Roll. Each and every one was amazing. Everything tastes very fresh and the rolls were very large and filling.  My only downfall (and it's not costing them any stars) is that some of the non sushi items, and Sake, are a bit pricey (I.e. Seaweed salad for $5.50, large sake for $5.99). It's honestly a better deal to get one of the \"combos\" which include a large beer. I was lucky that I was with someone who wanted a beer, so that I could enjoy my large sake for an add-on price of $2.99.  To match the delicious food, the staff was also delightful. Hostess was friendly and our waiter/server was taking care of the entire restaurant but never skipped a beat to ensure everyone was well taken care of.  Definitely will be back!",

Poor costume service that start with waitress that are hard to understand and not really know to explain the menu when a question pops. Beside that I've never seen a place that is so cheap about the spicy mayo. You can clearly notice that spicy mayo here is really hard to get at the amount desire and if you ask for more they will make you feel uncomfortable- experience that each visit here. The worst case with this spicy mayo scenario was when I got 2 rolls to go and ask for an extra spicy mayo on top of the one they have already put at the box guess what happen they just max the same spicy mayo little jar that already was inside! Thats definitely ruined the experience . Big time! Yet I didn't mind the spicy mayo thing as long as I get my food and leave pretty quick when I have a busy day. Last visit here after long time I haven't visit when clearly I'm a return costume the owner is always greats me when I come and I usually order appetizer, one or two rolls and mucchi ice cream for dessert still it didn't make them think that's enough to wave off a roll I accidentally order off my check - a roll that and didn't eat. Deeply offended:(  You probably guess this time I didn't stay and order my favorite mucchi ice cream. All I can say is: SAVE A PENNY LOSE A DOLLAR",

I asked for a rum and coke, 10 minutes later the nice waiter came back and said they only have Pepsi. Who drinks a rum and Pepsi? Lol, I did and it was terrible. They have one speaker overhead and it is bumping gangster rap with all of the expletives. Something I'm down for listening to in my car or at home but in a sushi joint? C'mon!

    "text": "I can't remember what this sushi place was called before Sushi J took over, but I remember over the years it went downhill (it was good at one point), and I wasn't surprised when it finally closed.  I finally came in since the change was made and thought the sushi itself was delicious! In fact, from a pure sushi/taste/freshness standpoint it's probably the best I've had in the Phoenix area.   I ordered rolls from the \"Happy Day\" menu (basically Happy Hour), which is offered all day Sun-Thurs. Both the spicy tuna roll & eel tempura (which is not roll you'd commonly find on a HH menu) were delicious. All the HH rolls are under $6, and there's a few more options than just the standard things you'd see at most sushi places (in addition to eel tempura I know the Las Vegas roll was on the menu).  For the sushi and service alone (our waitress was very attentive and OFFERED to split our bill individually for 6 people) I'd give this place 5 stars. The reason I'm not is I guess a personal one, but hey, it's my review.  I generally associate sushi places w/Happy Hour, and like I mentioned this place has rolls all day Sun-Thurs (not Friday), and that's it. No appetizer specials. No drink specials (although I believe our waitress mentioned something about house wine specials that weren't on the menu). The sushi itself here is great though, and I definitely come back for it.",

    "text": "One star simply because this place DOES NOT actually open according to their hours listed on their door or on their website.  I'm not even able to rate upon food because they've never been open during their business hours when I go.   Today is Sunday. According to the internet sushi j should be open at 5. According to the sign on the door it should be open at 5:30. Regardless, my boyfriend and I showed up at 5:40 to a completely dark restaurant and when I peered into the restaurant it was empty, and dirty dishes were still on the table with no one to be found. We stood outside along with another gentleman who also believe they were supposed to be open. We both ended up leaving for other options.   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US. Why bother to post hours if you're not going to follow them. Trust me, I am not the type to write a negative reviews, you can even scroll my past reviews to see but when it's your third time to try and eat at a restaurant that everyone raves about and they aren't open. It's not worth it. I'll stick with Sakana or sushi roku. Save your time, they're probably not even open.",

I started with the fire in the mouth roll and it did have a subtle hint of spice but nothing id call spicy.   I then had the Tootzy Roll off the happy day roll menu finishing with the Las Vegas roll.   I have been to a lot of sushi spots some in AZ and some not in AZ.   Will I be back, maybe. My tab for 3 rolls and miso soup was $27, which isn't bad for sushi.   For those just starting to venture down the sushi roll this is probably up your ally.",

Tempura was also very crunchy and delicious. The only disappointment was that the shrimp was pretty small.  Both rolls were great!! I am especially in love with the tuna one since it had seared tuna on top. The fish was very fresh and everything just melted in my mouth.  To top everything off, they are running a 30% off special during dinner time and 20% off during lunch. The price was AMAZING for the quality and quantity of food that we got. I'm very sad that we're just here for business...but I will definitely be back before we leave!",

This restaurant is a small hole in the wall in a strip mall. Definitely not aimed at tourists.    My complaint is with another member of the service staff. The girl who was responsible for taking empty plates away, re-filling your water, etc was there literally every 2 minutes. And she would interrupt your conversation to ask if you wanted more water, were we done with this or that, can she take it away. At first it was like OK...let's stay hydrated. But then it became very annoying as we could not actually even have a dinner conversation since it was being interrupted so often. So in no way was it a relaxing dinner.   If I was back in Scottsdale, I would want to go back for the food as it was delicious. But I would not do it I wanted to have a fun, relaxing dinner.",

It wasn't like they forgot, our server kept coming back around and apologizing saying it will be out soon blah blah but eventually we just cancelled the last roll cause our appetite was gone. I guess they were trying to serve each table 1 or 2 rolls at a time instead of finishing the entire order at once. I really dislike when restaurants do that because I'm not trying to spend 2 hours to complete my dinner! Also, if people came in after us it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if they got their food after us. That's normally how it works. Such a pity cause we liked the food.  And one thing, don't slice the pieces into odd numbers! The monster roll was delicious but I contemplated whether or not to rock paper scissor the last piece. Lol",

    "text": "Went shopping at TJMax with friends and after quickly looking at YELP and seeing this place had 4.5 stars thought we'd try it out. The place was almost completely full at 8:00pm on a Wednesday night. The menu was huge with good prices. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. We then ordered the best sushi I've had in AZ for quite some time. I'm talking melt in your mouth sushi. We had a variety of rolls and Nigiri. All of it was excellent. The cucumber salad was delicious too, thinly sliced with just the right amount of vinegar...light and refreshing. The tempura veggies were yummy too. Boy was I surprised when I opened up YELP to write this review and saw all the recent one star reviews. All I can say is this was my first visit and I will be back.",

For lunch, we got the J sashimi combo (plus the \"ADD\" of spicy tuna), cucumber wrap (didn't even get a chance to try it since my wife said it was so good), & Prince of Persia roll (lots of meat and lots of good flavor combo)  Sashimi slices were more like burger patties!  No joke.   I don't eat rice, but I actually wanted to get some rice because the slices were so big.   I hope Arizonians (I'm a San Diegan) support this place so we have a legit place to keep coming back to for business trips.    Side note...The playlist stood out to me because I don't think there was a single song that I didn't like (I know, it's minute, but it helps the ambiance...which, while we're at it, good ambiance, except the tables needed an upgrade).",

The eel roll was 90% fake crab with Mayo, gross.  The fake crab was not described as part of these rolls.  We sent the salmon/fake crab roll back.  The eel one we dumped.

Asked for my usual spicy salmon skin hand roll and it came out perfect. They don't have spicy salmon skin but let alone they have it which most places around here don't carry it. Got the sashimi sampler. Bomb. Fish was flaky and tender. All of it melted in my mouth. I always finish with 2 piece tako, which is octopus, and some places have decent cut and pieces but this place had great slices and good size pieces that were a bit chewy like it's supposed to be!! Perfect lunch spot and not even expensive!! Sake is warm and always good",

The manager Meggie was very nice enough to order special premium soju for us. The head sushi chef was very nice & tried to cater to what we like.  I must say, Saba was the best I've ever had anywhere else. Because so many things can go wrong with Saba, many restaurants/chef are afraid to make in house.  Yellow Tail was very fresh.  Tuna wasn't as good as they made it sound. It's Blue Fin but from Mexico. Because of the water temperature, it's not as good. Red/fresh in the center but outside changes to dark color really quick onece you cut it. Spicy Scallop was not what I would recommend. Very fishy but not heavy with mayo. Over all, it was a great experience.   Servers do need to pick up their slack. Recommend appetizers & informing happy hour would really help the customers have better experience.",

    "text": "I don't know if Sushi J has changed owners, I went on an off night god knows what happened during my disastrous visit but I can tell you is that I will never ever visit this place again.   I came here after a fellow yelp buddy recommended it, who is like me, a fan of traditional Japanese no frills just great fresh fish sushi and after reading a ton of great reviews (and seeing some insane pictures) I thought this was going to be a great evening. Wrong!  I walked in, and asked to be seated at the sushi bar... They were busy but not insanely busy. My waiter (who was the only saving grace of this evening) came over and asked me what I wanted to drink, I ordered some sake and asked him if I could do an omakase meal he said absolutely and he spoke to the sushi chef, I told my waiter and the chef that I eat everything and prefer more traditional style sushi. The chef then tells me he will make me a great roll - I should have known right then that this wasn't going to end well. I clarify to him that I do more nigiri sushi, sashimi and wanted like ebi, uni etc. He says ok ok....  I wait for what seems like forever, I am then served my first dish... Two pieces of salmon sashimi wrapped around KRAB with spicy mayo and avocado on top and two pieces of tuna belly nigiri.... Ummmmm, no. I call over my waiter and politely say that this isn't really what I was wanting, that I don't eat krab and that I had asked for whatever was fresh.   My waiter, bless him... gets me a new sushi chef, I move closer to them. There was obviously ZERO communication between the chefs or my waiter and my new chef because after waiting about 15 minutes for my next plate, I was served nearly an identical plate of two tuna nigiri and salmon sashimi. After I receive that plate the sushi chef asks me if I was done. While I was eating my mediocre sushi, I saw my sushi chef take out a VACCUM SEALED BAG OF TUNA, that was enough to take my appetite away. I told the chef that I was done and I just wanted my bill. I explained to her that I had driven 30 minutes in the rain that evening to try their place out after hearing great things and that I was frustrated that I was served basically the same thing twice. I arrived at 6:40 and left at 7:35 with two courses, beyond upset and frustrated.   The manager/owner came over as I was waiting to sign my bill, apologized profusely, gave me a hug and you could tell she felt bad and gave me a coupon for 10.00 off a future visit, she didn't charge me for one order of the sushi and took 15% off my bill.   I appreciate them going to great lengths to try and rectify the situation but things went so bad that I don't think there is any way I could ever look past the faults of the evening, and the whole tuna vacuumed sealed in a bag... ick  I am borderline 1.5-2.0 stars for this place based on my experience. I would assume if you are looking for more traditional sushi this would be a great spot for you, but if you're like me and you want traditional sushi your better off elsewhere.",

    "text": "I was in Scottsdale for business, and when I had a free minute to myself, I hit up one of my friends who happened to be stationed in Arizona for his military duties. After telling him about my lenten diet that requires me to abstain from meat and rice, we settled on Sushi J.  It was nothing short of fantastic.  Parking is easy because it's located in a plaza that wasn't even close to busy, and we were seated at the bar.  I was telling the chefs about the situation with my diet, and one had the audacity of saying, \"Don't worry.  I got you.\"  He asked what kind of fish I liked, and then proceeded to make two customized rolls for me--each of which were fantastic.  One used both hamachi and spicy tuna, with rice paper wrapping it together with some lettuce, green onion and cucumber.  The other roll was also wrapped in rice paper, and it included unagi, avocado, topped with a drop of Sriracha with something else crunchy.  They were awesome.  I haven't seen this friend in a while so we also ordered some sake bombs as well as the calamari, which was also quite tasty.  The green tea mochi ice cream was also good.  After dinner I found out that the person who made me those customized rolls was the head chef.  How crazy is that?  I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area.",

We arrived during happy hour which didn't have enough variety for rolls, but we decided on some sushi sets of salmon and tuna. They were pretty good. We ordered a baked scallop roll which seemed to be overcooked. The sauce on top which is mayo based was way too dark and melted down compared to other places. It was just ok. We ordered water since our festival included many drinks sampling. It was strongly flavored with cucumber. It was overpowering for me. I prefer just a hint of flavor. Since I don't live close, probably won't return.",

But I had no idea exactly who was my waitress I kept getting waited on by multiple people nobody seemed to really know much about the menu or who was in charge. My food came out pretty promptly oh that's quite disappointed in how small the size of the roles were and nothing was under $8 even a happy hour price except for my miso soup which was the only thing that was a decent price for the size. I don't think I was checked on more than once after I got my food I had to get up and get napkins from the table behind me. I ordered fried rice to go which I asked not to be put in till I was about to leave but it was sitting there for a while while I was eating. Two of the things that I ordered were priced higher than the menu suggested. I had to wait forever to get my bill and finally asked and told the girl I was ready to leave. I'm giving it to stars because the people were friendly the food tasted good but the two stars is simply because the size of the roles were very small and overpriced, and the organization in which the staff takes care of the customers could use some improvement.",

I went in and it was not very crowded so I sat at the sushi bar and ended up sitting in front of Chef J himself. You could tell he really loves what he does because he was making fun rolls for customers and making stuff up as he went along. I ordered a spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail roll and the Friday Night Fever roll. All were great and it is great quality sushi. I would recommend this place. My only complaint would be that it was kind of a boring atmosphere, but it was only a Tuesday night.",

She took the orders of half our table and put her book away, thanked us for our order and I reminded her that I still needed to order.  We waited. And we waited. Finally the first of our order came out and we waited some more. It's fine that it came out a little at a time but the wait in between each was very long. I watched as people who arrived after us received full orders while I was still waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting for my last roll to arrive, I wasn't hungry anymore and wanted to cancel the last roll. Everyone around me had finished their dinners and wanted to go. I was just about to tell them nevermind when it arrived, 40 minutes after ordering. We asked what took so long and the waitress, non apologetic, told us they had a lot of take out orders. I took that to mean that all the take out orders were more important than me, who was sitting in their restaurant, waiting. She still wasn't apologetic when she said she would give us 10% off. In fact, at our complaint she seemed irritated, playing more to the idea that my satisfaction was meaningless to her as she had more important customers to tend to. In short, I will not be returning to Sushi J. If their take out orders are so important to them, perhaps they should switch to a take out only restaurant. Maybe then, in house customers won't be such an inconvenience to them.",

Their \"happy day\" selection is pretty mediocre and those are the only specials they really have.  We tried the crunchy california, the spider, and one special roll.  All of them were OK. Their eel sauce is \"homemade\" but its weak and not flavorful.  If the pricing was lower maybe this place would be acceptable but for the same bill I can go to Sakana or Sakebombers and get way better quality, service, decor, and overall experience.",

Went here most recently the Friday night of the Super Bowl weekend, and we were seated right away. Waitress was nice but in training - but hey, we all gotta start somewhere. Only thin bad I have to say was that as delicious as fairly priced the food is, they were understaffed when we visited and ended up with longgg wait times for our food.   Would definitely return.",

Also they have been giving 30% discount for grand opening and that has made it the best deal I'm town.

We had Ahi Ahi Tartare:  a taste extravaganza, great combo of ingredients with just the right amount of seasoning.  When you get there, it's worth reading the menu for this item. The Marylin Monroll, you'll think it may be pricey but believe me well worth indulging your taste buds.  These 2 items were premium selections, $12.99. On the budget side, they have several rolls in the $3.5-$5 range that indicate only 5 pieces.  We had the Spicy Tuna, the Tootzy and Crunchy Cali.  Don't be deceived about the 5 piece serving, these are not your typical super market rolls, they're huge easily the equivalent to 50% larger.  Then there's the taste.  OMG.  Everything is real fresh, combination of ingredients is killer. We also shared a bottle of perfectly drinkable pinot grigio from Washington for $24, good value.   Service was great.  We had Mei Qi as our server on a Sunday night about 6pm as the place was filling up.  Did I mention she was great. I was in town with my wife on business.  I'll have to make the effort to create more work in the area just to be able to come back for an extraordinary dining experience.      Bobby C",

When we  ordered the shrimp for our appetizer they said it would be a bit cause they just changed the oil for the fryers. As soon as they told me they were changing the oil my 1st thought was take all the time with something like that. So we made our dinner order and everything came out together which wasn't a big deal cause didn't take very long at all. The sushi was amazing some of the best I've ever had. I had a monster roll and the spider roll. I was sad when it was gone but full and extremely satisfied! The shrimp tempura was so perfect and the sauce it comes with is awesome! My fiance doesn't like sushi so she had the combination fried rice which fresh and so delicious! When it came to pay they brought us out some green tea ice cream on the house cause of the wait for the appetizer which again wasn't a big deal. They were so friendly there and awesome! It's a small drive for me to get to but definitely my go to sushi place now!",

We asked the waitress who said they were working on it. 45 minutes later, Everyone was still served before us and they had arrived after. When the roll came it wasn't what we ordered. We disputed the bill, and my favorite, the waiteress says, in the future just so you know, you got the roll you ordered. It was correct. I explained the fish inside the roll wasn't the same as the one we ordered. It was a completely different roll. But of course no one checked on us so we could let them know it was an incorrect order.   Also. Outside the sign says Dim Sum served here. I asked the waitress and she said, oh yea, it's gyoza. Sooooooo you don't have dim sum. She says we have sticky buns? Needless to say we will never return and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

For me, I like a sushi restaurant, Japanese-owned and it must serve fresh and quality seafood. Sushi J is off the beaten path imo, a nice family run place I believe.  We walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff. My bf said we wanted to sit at the bar, she walked us over and we picked a good seat.  Hostess, waitress and itamae were very friendly and very prompt with getting drinks and food.  We ordered so many items, I don't remember them all. I remember everything were delicious and fresh. I really like the Soft shell crab, Shrimp tempura, Fried Calamari with Jalapenos, Cucumber Wrap, and Albacore.  Pricing was good too. I recommend this place for fresh sushi!",

As I walked in, I was warmly greeted as I ran to the restroom which was spotless! I'm kind of weird and a bathroom can make or break a good meal/restaurant so Sushi J passed another step.   Once in my seat the service was top notice. Not too much but yet very attentive. I was pleasantly surprised by the Lunch Happy Hour with a long list of items. I'm pretty simple and started with the house salad, which was much bigger than expected, especially for HH. Very colorful with mixed greens, red peppers, tomatoes, and radishes.  The miso soup was fantastic and the avocado rolls were perfectly ripe.    Despite my simple meal, they have some really fun rolls and a great drink menu.   The rest of the restaurant looked very clean as well!  And, the sushi bar is a good size and looks pretty fun.    Overall, 5+ stars. I'll be back and do recommend Sushi J.",

I had the sashimi mixed plate again with the sushi rice.   It comes with miso soup and salad.   My son ordered the mixed tempura appetizer, which I shared.   Battered, seasoned and fried to perfection.   Light and tasty as it should be.   '  He ordered the mixed nigiri, and, of course, he loved it since it was more or less the same sashimi that I had.  I was trying to guess what the salad dressing is, but it's a good mix of ingredients.   I think it has a dab of wasabi, maybe ginger, soy sauce, miso?   Don't know.   It was good though.

I also had mojito happy hour price.   Unfortunately our best item was jalapeno bomb and mojito... that's really sad for a sushi restaurant.   toro tastes like normal cut of fish, scallop doesn't taste as fresh as the one we bought straight from mitsuwa supermarket or chula seafood but quiet slimy and tasteless. We usually get the set of simple spicy tuna/salmon to grade sushi restaurants new to us, quiet disappointed as they were loaded with rice probably 75% of the rolls.",

We were pleasantly surprised to learn that J, the owner, makes the sushi. Every roll we watched him make looked like a piece of art! J has talent!  I ordered a bowl of edamame (steamed or nuked perfectly), the happy hour Las Vegas roll and the Alaska roll. That was by far the best Vegas roll I've ever had. The salmon and crab meat were soooo fresh! The Alaska roll was good, but I probably won't order it again with so many other choices.  My friend had the Candy Cane and Superman rolls. She liked the Candy Cane roll so much that she ordered a second one. The service was excellent- almost a little TOO good because the wait staff kept standing behind us in anticipation of our last bite to remove our plates (were they short on dishes?). I hadn't even started chewing my last piece when he reached to take my plate. I almost choked on my food as I tried to ask him to leave my plate so I could save the sauce for my second roll.   I loved our experience at Sushi J so much that I returned the following night to try the Candy Cane roll. My new fav roll AND my new fav sushi restaurant.  I highly recommend you try Sushi J!",

I've tried several different rolls and everything tasted pretty good.  The nigiri sushi have a large portion of fish covering a small portion of rice like it should be at a good sushi restaurant.  The entrees looks like standard Japanese dishes like teriyaki chicken, pork cutlet, etc.  I did try the ginger calamari which I haven't seen on a Japanese menu. They use large body sections of the calamari pounded until very tender (maybe a little too tender, I like a little chew on my calamari) sauteed with onions and mushrooms in a light sauce. I couldn't taste much ginger in the sauce, but the it was pretty good and different.  I had the squid and jalapeno tempura appetizer plate.  It came on a large plate which in itself was a meal   They separate the body and legs of small squids to tempura separately.  The sliced jalapeno tempura added a nice bite to the plate.  The dipping sauce was really good and help cool your tongue from the jalapenos.  The ice tea was strange.  It was very dark colored like a strong tea, but it didn't have any taste.  It was like colored water.  Also had a diet Pepsi which was a little flat.  The Kirin beer was good.  Also the water was good.  It tasted filtered.  Some of the items on the menu have the wrong price.  For example the uni sushi is priced at $7.99 on the menu, but you're charged $8.99.  Right now they have a 30% discount for dinner.  Not sure how long it's going to last, but it's a screaming deal.  *** 7/1/16 ***  I come here about every 2 weeks.  They've fixed their ice tea.  The squid and jalapeno tempura is still good, but it's smaller portions for the same price.  Sushi hasn't changed.  It's fresh and great quality.  Fresh fish is very perishable.  You don't have to toss it, but it shouldn't be served raw once it passes several days. The fish should be sliced before you serve it.  Pre-slicing the fish starts decomposing it.  The rice is always perfect here.  I've been to other places where the rice is too soggy.  Rice is like pasta.  It should be served al dente.",

Locally owned, Chef J is knowledgeable & takes great care in creating an experience you want to come back for. The salmon skin roll is one of the best I've ever had & the yellowtail sushi was fresh & well portioned. The Lord of Tuna roll with thin slices of lemon, plus \"fresh\" wasabi was incredible!  The portions are generous & the pricing fair. They have great \"Happy Day\" specials...all day specials vs just a happy 'hour.'  Maggie was awesome & so personable on the phone we had to come in for he 4th of July to celebrate with them! Tina was wonderful as well & as a team their service was delightful.  If you're looking for your neighborhood sushi spot in old town Scottsdale that's perfect connecting & enjoying sushi with people who want you coming back, this is the place to be!",

We were seated and given the menu. We waited and waited and waited for the server to take our orders. The sushi chefs saw me looking around waiting for the waitress. The staff were just talking and ignoring that we were just waiting. When she finally arrived, I began placing my order and was surprised to have the waitress interrupt me mid sentence. She continued to talk about how good the monster roll was. Also, the Alaska roll is on the happy day menu but not on the normal menu.   We ordered the monster roll, ahi ahi tartare, and dynamite roll.   The ahi ahi tartare was good. Surprised how small it was though.   Monster roll was by far the best option we ordered. You get 5 pieces.   Dynamite roll was odd. It tasted like something was missing. I appreciated the nice pieces of scallop but was a little disappointed by how little of the topping there was.   Overall I'm disappointed. I can't believe this place was voted top sushi restaurant. Will not be coming back.",

After seeing the numerous positive reviews and essentially a 4.5 star rating, I thought I found my go-to sushi spot. Sadly, I couldn't have been more wrong.  I was super excited about the happy hour deal, and I guess others were too because it became quite busy during our visit. Our waitress (Ashley B.) was going from table to kitchen, but it seemed like there were other staff standing around? I'm not sure if they need to hire more waiters or if something was off that day.  THE SERVICE. What service? We weren't able to have our water refilled, waited 30 mins for food and another 30 mins for the ginger but it never came :(  THE FOOD. The sushi was decent but contained a piece of plastic AND bone (double-whammy). Our waitress seemed quite busy and there wasn't anyone nearby.. we got the feeling the staff would be indifferent to our discontent, so we didn't bother to mention   Overall, I was unimpressed but hope that it was a one-off from their usual quality and service.",

I feel the Monster roll is very big and awesome! The saba sashimi had great salty fishy taste too! That's what saba is about!  They also have this Japanese beer that I don't usually see at other restaurants. I'm not talking about Kirin or Sapporo. You'll see the beer called Musashino when you look at the menu. It felt like a Blue Moon except more crisp!  Overall, the experience was good. Too bad one of the waitress didn't understand one word of English. Hahaha. I think she spoke Chinese only.",

Takoyaki from the specials board seemed to have no octopus at all.   Tried 3 rolls and they were underwhelming- lots of fake crab/mayo filling. Skimpy on the fish, eel, and avocado, but heavy on the sauce.  They did bring out a free green tea ice cream sundae (not sure if that's standard?), but though I appreciate the gesture, it wasn't really wanted.  The place had a decent crowd on a Friday night, but I wouldn't return. Will leave it for the other fans.",

This place was pretty good the first time but fell short on a number of fronts this time.   It was service primarily. Not because lack of effort but they just failed on performance. Our waitress(s) we're trying hard and were unbelievably sweet. Tried hard and failed. The restaurant was not very busy but our meals took a long time. Both the sushi and the cooked items took too long. But they were ok. Tempura was light and flaky. Good. Miso was a little weak. Sushi was good but  I am afraid I'm not coming back to give this place another shot.",

    "text": "Note! There are two sushi restaurants with J and sushi in the name in the same parking lot. Make sure you end up in the right place!  When sushi cravings occur, they must be met. My roommate and I decided to try  this place since it was next to the mall and had good reviews. We came in around 9 on Saturday and were pleasantly surprised that they were still having happy hour until closing. I ordered the shrimp tempura, samurai roll, and custard buns. The shrimp tempura came out pipping hot and was very beautifully presented. The shrimp was sweet and very lightly battered. It was cooked to a nice golden color and was crispy. There was an onion ring on the plate as we used to hold the shrimp up.. yes I ate that too obviously and it was delicious. The samurai roll was a shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna on top. The spicy tuna had a little kick to it. I wouldn't say it was spicy to me but for someone who doesn't normally like to eat as hot as I do, it would probably be considered spicy. The roll was drizzled with eel sauce. The roll was really fresh and I wish I had more room I would have ordered another one. The custard buns are steam buns with custard inside. I'm pretty sure the custard was put inside before the buns were steamed because the texture was not custardy and creamy. It was smooth still but it was now more clear in its yellowish color and looked more like a preserve. It was interesting. It wasn't bad, I just don't know if I would order it again.   Another note my roommate ordered the egg rolls and they have cabbage in them. We all know how I feel about that. I didn't even bother trying it.   Staff was super friendly and played really good music. Happy is so good, we will be back soon.",

We came in on a Monday night to a pretty empty scene, but fortunately, that meant we got our food a lot faster! We started off with a variety of nigiri - some were decent, some were a little more questionable in terms of texture and flavor to those who were more seasoned eaters of sushi. The sushi rolls, however, were good since all the condiments and fillings make each bite tasty. The Monster roll was definitely a crowd favorite.   Huge parking lot. Big sure to make sure which sushi restuarant you're going to since there's two in teh plaza.",

However, everything I ate was very fresh and tasted fantastic.   The only things I would change: Colder beer and warmer room temperature. The beer was cool, but I like my beer very cold. The restaurant air temp was a little cold for me, but I think it was because it was chilly outside. That is all I would change.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for great sushi and at a good price.",

The chef has been one of my favorite sushi chefs since I have moved here 3 years ago. Formerly working at another very popular sushi restaurant north of their current location.  J has been so successful that he opened his own restaurant due to a great fan base and superb sushi.    I would recommend this sushi restaurant over any other sushi restaurant in Scottsdale just for the quality of the food and cuts.  If your looking for a sushi restaurant that is yuppie and pretentious there are others to choose from and way more over priced.  But here, you really do get the Japanese food experience.    I give J 5 stars for their outstanding sushi, sashimi and other great dishes.  If you can't find the restaurant it means you have never been here and do not live here all year round!  So follow the map and come in.  Your welcome!",

It came with a spicy mayo mixed with something else in it. I would say this dish was a 3 out of 5 compared to what I've had in the past. Good but not great. It could have had more calamari and maybe a different flavored sauce to dip in The second dish was sashimi salad. This was 4 out of 5. 4 types of fish with a hearty salad We ordered the spicy tuna, this was good as usual. Kind of tough to mess this up.   My favorite was the dragon roll. Very well made. Probably the best dragon roll I've had.   Overall I really like this place And would definitely go back.",

We walked in and were instantly greeted by the sushi chefs and our server, David. Needless to say, this is our new favorite spot. The customer service was outstanding by both our server and the sushi chefs. I got the Crunchy Cali Roll and the Tootzy Roll on their Happy Hour rolls, and my boyfriend got the Alaskan, the California, and the Spicy Tuna Rolls. The first and last pieces of each of the rolls were filled with extra fish and other fillings. David also recommended a sauce they make fresh in-house called their Ginger Garlic Sauce, and it paired so well with it all. Everything is greatly priced, fresh, and delicious. They have so many different specials, and apparently on Monday's they have happy hour all day! I love supporting local places, and I'm so glad we decided to stop in because we will now be regulars at Sushi J! Thank you for such an amazing experience!",

We had two other rolls as well both tempura fried, disgusting, small cold shrimp and black salmon not cooked properly at all. I could not believe this place had such great reviews. Yelp completely steered me wrong on this one. I wish I could take this experience back, but I hope I can help others to not go here.

Other than that the experience was mostly good, the miso soup was good(though I do wish they would give more per bowl, it was pretty small), my friend said she loved the house salad, and the veggie tempura was good.

    "text": "I got extremely excited when I saw that Sushi J was opening as I live less than a mile away and am always looking for new sushi restaurants. I went in with low expectations because the old sushi restaurant that used to be there was pretty mediocre, but I was quickly blown away by my very first bite!  I came with a friend and we sat at the bar and started to chat with J the owner and head sushi chef. I put our order in his hands and he served us Suzuki (sea bass), Hamachi belly (yellow tail belly), and Big Eye tuna nigiri. Each piece was absolutely delicious. This was the first time I had Suzuki and it was so flavorful and went perfectly with the ponzu he brushed it with. Yellow tail belly was served slightly torched, and was rich and melted in my mouth. Fish pieces were very generous and were in perfect proportion to the rice. Rice was also perfectly seasoned (I am very picky about my sushi rice!) Then we ordered the Lord of Tuna roll which was wonderful and had an interesting twist with some mango included inside. Loved the tuna tataki served on top of the roll.   I had accidentally left my credit card there and decided that it was a good enough excuse to come back the very next day.......for yet another sushi dinner! This time I ordered the Fire in the Mouth roll - spicy tuna inside topped with hamachi and jalapeno. I loved how spicy it was, and the combo of tuna and hamachi. I also ordered the scallop nigiri (one of my very favorites) and it was wonderfully flavorful and fresh. I also ordered some hamachi and salmon pieces, again very large, fresh cuts that melted in my mouth.  Service was excellent, and it was great to be able to talk to J and watch him make his beautiful creations. Freshest fish I've found in Scottsdale so far. Only thing that would make this place better in my mind is if the atmosphere were a bit more lively or trendy. But still, 5 stars!",

    "text": "So I'm back again for the second time in a week... and tonight I am requesting Omakase. When I walk in, J's wife greats me, remembers me, and seats me at the sushi bar near J. I order some sake and let J know that I'm along for the ride and I'm excited to try anything he puts in front of me. I love omakase dining! I get to experience the chef's creativity and taste off-menu items that are unique and oftentimes, a little more adventurous.  My server James, who is also happy to see me back so soon, quickly delivers the bottle of cold sake that chef recommends, Kikiumo or something like that... is the lt blue bottle.  My first dish is presented and J explains that he's made striped bass wrapped around steamed asparagus and a thin slice of avocado. The two pieces are each topped with massago, scallions, and just a few sesame seeds. He says no need to use soy and I'm always more than happy not to mask the subtle flavors of the sashimi with soy. He points out the green sauce in the corner of the plate, pickled wasabi sauce, use just a little bit on top of each bite. Wow! I'm not sure the proper terms to describe the flavors of sashimi, but these bites were perfect mouthfuls of clean and fresh fish perfectly complimented by the sour and spice of the pickled wasabi sauce.  Chef continues to educate and entertain me and the other bar diners throughout the meal. He describes each dish he serves to me and seems genuinely eager to know I've enjoyed it.  I have buttery yellowtail belly that has been torch seared slightly, garnished, and drizzled with ginger ponzu. It's better than any yellowtail one ever tasted.  Chef J brings me fresh bluefin otorro two ways. Two pieces quickly torch seared to bring about the sweetness of the fat with a little ponzu. The other pieces are not garnished at all. Otorro is the best of the best! It's extraordinarily tender and nearly melts in my mouth.  Next up, fresh scallops served right in the shell. I love seared scallops and this is my first time tasting fresh, raw scallops. It's a familiar flavor yet with a sweet freshness and delicate soft texture that is wonderful. I may never settle for seared scallops again! Chef J brings me a deconstructed Albacore belly dish. The richness of the fish and creamy avocado, the salty salmon eggs, and smokey Bonito flakes, all balance perfectly with a touch of ginger sauce.  Mackerel is next and each piece of fish is topped with a little bit of massago and thin slice of jalapeno. Chef remembers from the first time he saw me, that I think ponzu is overwhelming with this strongly flavored dish and he omits it.  We're almost done... torch seared salmon belly in a mustard ponzu is the last savory dish I enjoy before what I'll call the dessert course. Much like ending a french meal with a sweet plating of seared foie gras, chef makes me baked eel with tamago and sesame. The sweet warm richness of this final dish is the perfect ending to a flawless and fresh fish adventure!",

The owners clearly take pride in their business. The service amazing. The food is even better. Homemade Wasabi- WOW. it's the best. Rolls are made to order with super fresh ingredients. Miso soup was hot, flavorful and had great seaweed in it. They brought out a plate with butterfish and I was very iffy about trying but I'm glad I did. Overall I couldn't be happier. The prices are also very reasonable.   If you are hesitant about going here- don't be.

I took the Monday Night Football suggestion of the \"Cardinals Roll\" and it was a FANTASTIC surprise! We loved it! Also, I re-ordered my standard Philly Roll and was wonderfully surprised that the cream cheese was perfect, it was standard full fat cream cheese. I know it's strange, but light cream cheese changes the whole texture of the roll.  I am extra excited to change and update this review, love this place even more now!",

I felt like I paid for premium sushi and got something you would find at a cheap revolving sushi place. The rolls looked haphazardly prepared and the soft shelled crab was mushy in the middle. The shrimp tempura was mostly flour. All the rolls seemed drenched in sauce. The setting are dark and uncomfortable and two of our family members got bit by bugs while sitting there.  Would not recommend this place.",

I've had fish from some solid joints on both sides of the country (shiro, morimoto)   Highlights of the night were the Sea Bass and Scallop.  Both were fan-F**-tastic..!  The scallops was simply sea-meat-butter... so damn good.  The blue fin was surprisingly fresh as well.  Another note on the blue fin, it was easily a 2 oz portion.  Their oysters (treasure cove, WA i think) were a perfect desert...  Oh...  I forgot to mention.... dinner was only $100...",

I work in San Francisco and have traveled quite a bit dining at some of the best sushi restaurants in the country so know quality fish when I see and taste it. I highly recommend sushi j!!!  We had the sashimi combo which featured yellowtail, salmon, albacore, and tuna. The portions were huge and the fish extremely fresh. Some of the best I've had and definitely the best ive had in phoenix. Also had the spicy tuna handroll and a special roll simply called THE roll.  Staff very friendly and prices are reasonable. Excited about quality sushi in my hood!!!!",

Also ordered salmon sashimi and superman roll which were also good, but the tuna roll was what I thought was best. Oh, and tried the butterfish for first time and thought it was good too, but since was my first time ever for this fish i have no reference but liked it.  I actually went there to see if they had high quality toro, but, sadly, I was told they don't serve it even though it's winter time:-(...boo. Nice quite atmosphere and clean dinning room.  Mom said the bathroom smelled sewage like and that they should deodorize or fix sewage pipes (they just opened for the day).  No such smell in dinning area and i didn't use mens room, so don't know if same in there. Service was pretty good for just one waitress, but we had to wait 15 or so minutes to order second round of sushi.  Almost asked for check instead, but son was really hungary.  Again, it was a Sunday and we showed up at 5:20pm, so i'm not going to fret too much because it is a small local business.  Not dying to go back, but it is on my list of good enough to recommend if one is in the area and not looking for fatty tuna on menu.",

I would highly recommend the Marilyn Mon-roll if you are looking for something on the light side with fresh crab and lobster.  If you are looking for a decadent roll, I would recommend the Candy Cane.  I can eat those again and again like I was addicted to a substance.  The prices are a little high, but it is the best sushi I have had in Arizona, hand down.  The ambiance is very quiet mood with a romantic type of lighting.  I would highly recommend going here for a date night.",

We normally never get rolls because of all the rice, but Sushi J has 4 great no rice roll options. We had the Marilyn monroll and the Phoenix lite roll. The Marilyn was wrapped in cucumber and was so flavorful. The Phoenix was wrapped in rice wrap and was also cool and refreshing.  You don't even need soy sauce the flavors are so great. And lite doesn't mean not filling. These 2 rolls had us plenty full.  We did get a starter combo with a large kirin light and a squid salad. We exchanged it for a seaweed salad because the squid was a bit too tough and chewy.  But a great spot thanks to yelpers.",

The majority of the food didn't arrive and what did was the wrong order.  The waitress who said she was new, repeatedly, had no idea at all what dish she was delivering, no idea of types of what different sushi looked like and was just lost.  Three different employees couldn't get the bill together.  It took 14 minutes standing at the cashier waiting for them to figure out how to total the bill.  I finally said, \"I'll add the correct items that were actually delivered, I'll show you the correct total and pay it in cash to end this nightmare.\" It was a complete uncoordinated mess.   It was so bad, it seemed like a Saturday Night Live sketch where no one working there had any idea what they were doing or what they were serving.  Too bad.",

The worn carpet, fishy smell and torn bench in the booth should have sent us back to our car to continue our search. If mediocre food is your idea of five stars, you found your place. The miso soup was tasteless, the pot stickers were bland with a sauce that was way too salty, and our two rolls were uninspired. When the rolls came with white ginger and both the specialty Crispy Bay and the classic Rainbow roll were ungarnished and skinny, we knew we were going to be disappointed. I was willing to grant another star if the dessert even came close to the waitress' lavish praise. But unfortunately it too was pretty weak. Two stars is generous.",

If you're into rolls, they have some of the best I've had. After coming back from LA and getting hooked on omakase after being to some awesome sushi spots, we were searching for something to fill the void. This is it. Jay serves up the best omakase in AZ and the value is insane. Sit at the sushi bar and have Jay serve you up an omakase meal. You will not regret it.   In terms of the ambiance, I am pretty sure this used to be a Wendy's or Starbucks or something as there is still a drive-through. Doesn't matter. Inside is put together well and Jay told me he's moving to another spot across the parking lot in a few months. Speaking of parking, since it's not in the middle of old town, the parking is super easy and available without having to deal with the normal old town scottsdale drama.   I'm almost hesitant to write this review, as I want this place to stay a (somewhat) hidden gem. That said, Jay is one of the nicest guys in the world and serves up the best sushi in AZ. Whether it's sushi rolls or letting Jay treat you to omakase, this place is leaps and bounds better than anywhere else we have been in AZ for sushi and we go out for sushi basically every weekend. The fact that it is lacking the usual old town snobbery is just icing on the cake.",

Originally I wanted to go to one of the local conveyor style sushi places but my husband found this place on yelp instead. All he needed to say was \"Love Me Salmon\" roll and I was hooked. That and the cucumber roll were definitely my two favorite dishes of the night! We also ordered the Monster roll and another one which I can't remember. My husband had a beer and I had some hot green tea, and we both finished with a scoop of green tea ice cream to share!  The only thing I was disappointed with was the hot tea. I was expecting something flavorful but I'm convinced it may have been dish water. It was very burned. It's hard to screw up tea so I set my expectations pretty low after that. I couldn't even drink it. Fortunately everything else was delicious.   And for the most part the service was stellar! At one point during our meal we overheard two servers talking about how they were going to get a massive tip from this other party. It's not major but I thought it was a bit unprofessional to discuss on the floor within earshot of other patrons.  In the end our bill was close to $100 including our tip. It's definitely not cheap, but the food was phenomenal. If you've got deep pockets and an empty belly craving sushi, I'd consider this a place worth visiting once a month.",

I always wanna get a table and I felt like if people knew the truth about this place it would be way too packed all the time.  I decided to be a good person and give credit where credit is due. Here's the lowdown:  -- Service is awesome, never had a bad experience but most places in Scottsdale have the basics down when it comes to service.  -- Atmosphere, is nice, no frills really but clean and nice and a good casual date place  --Fun level, if you sit at the bar the sushi chefs are pretty laid back and cool, talkative but not annoying chatty either.  At a table you can have fun, but it's not really a party atmosphere   -- FOOD (the good part, the part we are here for right????) man I tell you, I'm from New Orleans and we take our seafood seriously. This place has some of the freshest sushi I've had ANYWHERE not just in Arizona, Anywhere, seriously, it sounds like I'm joking but I've had Yellowfin Toro every time I've gone cause it's so fresh. Like Will Smith Fresh Prince of Bel Aire fresh. I'm telling you, places in Vegas and New York could take notes on some of the imaginative fun (and tasty) rolls they got here.  The Monster roll (look it up ) in particular is pretty killer but I honestly haven't had a bad roll, some are different and if you are more of a traditionalist, you may or may not want some of them but if that's you, no worries!!! Just get their awesome nigiri cause like I said , it's super fresh.  -- Price, yeah I mean, you could go places cheaper, but why would you? I mean that's like saying \" but some gas stations and grocery stores have sushi for like $5 a roll...\" Yeah yeah, I know, but which would you rather? A frozen burger with no cheese or a good burger with great meat and great toppings ?? Yeah that's what I thought ....   ------------/--/--/--/----------- SUMMARY: If you like sushi, go to Sushi J, see my man \"J\" and get yourself some delicious ass food...  EDIT: I went there again tonight and ordered some fried rice and a couple pieces of sushi(raw fish). My waitress put the items in separate bags so as not to alter the temperature of the raw fish from the hot fried rice. That's how good the service is!! So awesome",

    "text": "Raw fish that's fresh in the middle of the scorching-hot, arid Sonoran Desert is a huge challenge, I would imagine for sushi restaurants. But Sushi J has defied geography and has made it his own \"standard\" to always have the best cuts of the freshest fish (recently caught) with papers to prove otherwise.  I've only visited once (on a date) and had the special opportunity of having off-the-menu plates made exclusively by \"J\" himself. It was near life-changing - let me tell you... Quality of fish was on par with fish found in CA or WA, in my opinion.   I'm also not a wasabi fan - I hate the taste and avoid it at all costs. My date pleaded with me to at least try J's \"real wasabi\", not the fake, mint-green paste I've been avoiding. I try to be open-minded and so I did - quite impressive! It was almost a \"relish\" type consistency and really didn't taste similar to the mint-green paste at all!  The atmosphere isn't fancy or upscale, but it isn't a dump either. It's simple and serves its purpose - to provide a high-quality sushi experience. I would definitely rate this restaurant as #1 in the Valley, by far.",

Our mediocre but pricey meal last night left us both feeling sick and vomiting all night.   I don't want Sushi J to do poorly- wish they would turn the ship around. The quality of sushi wasn't good, the rice didn't particularly taste good. The atmosphere needs an update at well. $6 tekka maki? Everything seems at least a dollar over priced for unremarkable sushi.   After falling ill, I'm not sure I'd return unless the restaurant got overhauled.",

    "text": "Sushi J actually makes pretty darn good sushi, but for the price... it's hard to rate this super highly compared to other sushi restaurants that are equally priced but with a way cooler atmosphere. The prior establishment was seriously underpriced, and I'm sure that contributed to their move to Ahwautukee where the rent makes for more affordable sushi. I completely understand that to be located at this particular junction in Scottsdale can't be cheap, but it doesn't seem they're putting any of the extra dough by upping the sushi prices into the in-house vibe. There is an appeal to the \"hole-in-the-wall\" style venue for sure which is honestly well-kept and clean. But they don't handle rushes all that well, the service can be a little spotty, and I just have to say the wine list is awful (beer & wine only). Ok there, it's off my chest.  So after much exploration of the menu along with a mix of dine-in and takeout experiences, this is confidently my go-to sushi takeout place. The quality of the fish is quite above what I'd expect, and they make some great maki for sure. With that said, their online menu doesn't offer any descriptions of their specialty rolls. I've asked the hosts for takeout menus - which they don't have - so unless I want to go in person to look at the menu, wait for the whole order to be made, and then drive home, it's all up to memory. Lord of Tuna, Fire in the Mouth and a couple other staples are usual suspects - less because they are actually my favorite, more because those are the only ones I remember. They are always delicious though - I've never been disappointed in the quality.  I'd love to rank a small establishment like this with another star, but with the dine-in experience wanting for a little more and with how inaccessible they make the takeout process, here we are at 3 stars.",

Sitting inside at the sushi bar you can see the red car, probably the owners car parked right outside the restaurant. I thought this was a little tacky. However food and service definitely made up for it. J, Who is the owner of the restaurant is actually the sushi chef behind the bar. She really put his personal touch on all of our roles and sushi. We ordered over $150 worth of sushi and it was really really amazing. I especially liked the eel and scallops sushi that we ate. Also the service was outstanding. Are we just stopped by multiple times to check on if we needed a refill.The waitress even asked my friend if she needed a drink refreshed. Who asks if someone wants to refresh their soda half way through?   I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONE THING, although small touch. ..Amazing.",

The staff is awesome and J is a great guy. The food is prepared with pride and I've never been disappointed.  I feel like this place should be kept a secret it's so good. Highly recommend checking this place out.",
