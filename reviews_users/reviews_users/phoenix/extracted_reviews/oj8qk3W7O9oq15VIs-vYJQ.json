    "text": "Amazing. Perfect for a romantic dinner. Booked through Open Table and mentioned it was our anniversary; everyone who greeted us congratulated us. Asked us if we were interested in dining in the wine cellar room; quieter and more private. Beautiful there, but really cold -- they have blankets if you like. Meal was impeccable. Wife loved her heirloom tomato salad and halibut entree. My tortilla soup starter was perfect. The Three Little Pigs entree (barbecued loin, crisped pork belly, and braised [?] cheeks). Whimsical, fun, delicious and perfectly cooked. When I asked the server to sub something in for the polenta, he said, \"Of course, what would you like\"? Terrific wine list and beer menu. Service was right on point -- attentive, friendly, accommodating. Our Peaches & Cream Beignets dessert arrived with \"Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the bowl, and was comped. Literally nothing I would change about the meal or the experience. Well done!",

After waiting 45 minutes for our table (we had a reservation) and watching 3 other couples who walked in before us get seated (obviously regulars who Lon's wants to keep happy first and foremost) we finally got a pretty good table.  For the price we paid, I was extremely disappointed. My salmon, for lack of better words, was inedible. It was doused in salt. My husband ordered the beef tenderloin, and our waiter informed him they were all out but assured him they had a wonderful top sirloin. Our waiter went back to the kitchen only to find they were all out of that, but he could have a filet mignon instead. He ate 3 bites and couldn't choke any more of it down. We were celebrating a special occasion so went over to another nearby restaurant for our after-dinner drink so we could end on a happy note instead of the disaster of a meal we had at Lon's. I am not one to write bad reviews, but it was so unpleasant , I felt it was necessary. The 2 stars are because of the setting.",

    "text": "This is without a doubt the best overall package of a restaurant in Phoenix. I honestly cannot think of a better patio. Whether it be lunch or dinner, it is gorgeous. The signature dish, beef tenderloin over white truffle macaroni and cheese is one of my favorites in the whole city. I could eat three of them no problem. They offer a teriffic wine list, and have a number of my favorite scotches as well. The place is situated in  a 35 room botique hacienda inn, original Arizona adobe architecture. It was once the home of Lon Mcgarge, the western artist credited for the artwork on the Stetson hat. Great place for a special event, romantic evening, or just to treat yourself. They will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. I have only recieved in my 7 times dining there, one bad piece of service, later to find out it was the kids very first day. I don't like the mandatory valet parking, but I can understand why they do it, their lot isn't very large for a hotel. I can't imagine anyone not liking this place.",

    "text": "We ate at Lon's the evening after our wedding a year ago and had a memorable experience. A year later was a different story. Ambiance is beautiful on the patio. In reality the food is decent. Good quality but the older well established restaurants in Phx are notorious for relying heavily on butter, cream and oil for flavor. If you've lived elsewhere you know what I am referring to. Lon's is no different but does this 'genre' nicely anyhow. We arrived 10 min prior to res on Sunday. I'd made a note on res as to our history, wanting to make this our annual tradition and a 'go-to' spot as we live a 10 min walk away. Gent at front didn't even look up from computer screen and basically said 'just wait a bit.' Thirty minutes after res time we were seated. No offer of drinks in the meantime. Love the ambiance. Food was late, lukewarm, very heavily oiled and salty as heck (salmon and tenderloin). No sincere attempt from Lon's at making this memorable. I did not expect any sort of freebie or handout, just a sincere acknowledgment that someone had taken just a second to read what I had written on our on-line reservation about this special occasion for us. I realize we aren't the only couple to have an anniversary at Lon's but it is special for us and of all the restaurants in the Valley we chose to Lon's in hopes of beginning a long tradition. The server was very nice, Robert I believe. He did welcome us warmly and acknowledged our anniversary and we were happy with his attentiveness.  May give Lon's another try as we all have off nights but not for a special occasion.",

And we'll also say (theoretically, of course) that those 4 friends might have required the assistance of a dolly to leave the restaurant.    The restaurant itself is beautiful. Classy, upscale, and spendy.  Because we were clearly knee deep in bad decisions, we ordered more cocktails - yum.    The basket of bread they bring is gluten nirvana.  The house pulled mozzarella was a wonderful way to start our meal.  The ahi tuna appetizer might be the best piece 'o fish I've ever had.  It was tender, buttery, and so fresh that it nearly jumped in my mouth all by itself.  The truffle mac n' cheese is required eating as well.  Desserts consumed at our table were the cowboy candy bar, peach cobbler, and sorbet - all got rave reviews.    This is a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious meal with friends.  I would like to come back to have dinner on the patio when it doesn't feel like hell outside.",

It was crunchy but yet so soft. My BF had the serlion. He said it was amazing. One of the best he has ever had. The view on the patio was spectacular. And we had a musician.

The soup was VERY salty  The Dumpling (singular) was burnt. The waiter said it was \"re-fried\".  Again we sent it back. Manager actually brought the plate back and asked what was wrong. When he was told he brought it back and a fresh one dumpling was brought out. Main courses came out 15 minutes later: prime rib was very rare and horrible quality chewy meat. The Lobster Pot pie was one huge pastry top .Under the top ( see picture) were 4 tiny morsels of lobster with sauce and no veggies. Ridiculous!  Dessert are in 20 minutes: hot chocolate with cookies came out so cold there was a film over the hot chocolate like a chocolate pudding. When we told the waiter who brought it out he laughed!  In summary: Horrible food, Horrible quality control I n kitchen, Horrible service! Manager took $175 off the check! As we left he said \" see you again\". Ha!!!",

So we went to the the bar and got a drink and were approached two times by the hostess asking if we were ready to sit. So we chugged out drinks and were seated. The waiter approached our table smelling like he had just smoked an entire pack of cigarettes. We ordered a few appetizers that were so gross they were in inedible.

Top notch staff generally, very professional. Sit on the patio.  BUT...the food. Just very marginal in my opinion. I sigh and groan inwardly when Mother wants to go there, but I soldier on. But this last meal......................I had to write.   Monkey Bread. Ok, not great, the sauce is yum, the bread itself-no discernible yeasty taste, which I something I like, and it's very very dense bread, so it really doesn't soak up the yum. Or we got yesterday's bread. Why do they serve it in that teeny dish? You can't really eat it without all the sauce spilling out, making a mess everywhere. Mother was distressed at the mess, so I poured her monkey bread out onto her fruit plate, but I shouldn't have to do that. Guys, serve it in a bigger bowl-not deeper, but wider!!  I'm really not sorry about the tablecloth.   Oh, I did mention the fruit plate, didn't I? I was trying to forget the completely unripe melon (2 kinds) that had been sliced too closely to the rind of the melon, so not only was it unripe (c'mon kitchen!), you couldn't really eat it without cutting off the rind. Not that it was a big deal I guess, since 1 piece of each kind was enough to realize it was basically inedible.   Short rib poutine.--well, the short ribs must have done something really bad that day, because the kitchen KILLED THEM DEAD. Terribly overcooked. Unable to eat them overcooked.  DARN IT MOTHER!!",

A luncheon for 37 in The Stetson Room was perfect for our group of mostly Phoenix natives! The private room gave guests space to visit without the overwhelming noise of most restaurants. Beautiful ambiance with a warming fire, rustic painted ceiling and garden patio.   Now onto the food and service - great! A beautiful resort catered meal of salad, choice of steak frite or salmon and a honey choco torte plus coffee and tea service. Delicious and guests were pleasantly surprised by the experience.   Our party size outgrew The Library Room for up to 34 but we were equally pleased with this location. Lon's has rooms for varying sized groups and always delivers an exceptional experience for a small party. This was the third time we've hosted at this venue over many years and we look forward to future visits.",

Not a place for glitz and people who are dining \"to be seen.\" More elegant and understated kinda place. Good privacy if you are searching for an intimate meal. Also several larger tables, as I noticed two or three groups of 6+ enjoying meals.   2) service - wait staff, hostess and sommelier all very attentive & knowledgeable.   3) wine list - extensive. Wow. Something for everyone. All regions of the world and many price points. And the sommelier will listen to you and make recommendations fitting your taste and budget  4) menu and food - tantalizing. My wife had a perfectly cooked 6oz filet medium rare \"push\". I had a very tasty rack of lamb, also cooked perfectly to order. I wish we were bigger eaters (not really), as there were some apps and salads that caught our eye   Can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "We went for brunch. I had really high expectations. They weren't met.   I also wouldn't say I was too disappointed.   It's summer, so obviously the patio is not able to deliver its full potential. Service was low energy. Dining room was dead.  The food was good. I had the sliders but got to sample the short rib hash and eggs benedict. I'd actually get the benedict if I were to go again.   The highlight was the bartender's substitution for a kir royale. Using hibiscus syrup, it tasted like rose petals! This, alone, has made me put Lon's on my Happy Hour bucket list and I feel fairly confident that my expectations will be met for that one!!",

    "text": "I would give 0 stars if I could. This was my first time visiting Lon's. I'm a professional cake decorator and brought a cake I made for a friend's birthday. When asking for plates and silverware for the cake I was asked by, Brett, our waiter if I also brought our steaks. Then he proceeded to ask if I had called ahead about the cake. I guess he noticed our confused looks on our faces and he rushes off with the cake saying he'll take care of it. Little did they know that my New Yorker boyfriend was a text away. At the end of our night with them, because of the call he received by said boyfriend, the manager came to apologize for the disrespectful comment and to inform us that they have a $12 cake cutting fee. I had no problem that there was a fee to begin with. You would have thought they would have waived that for the ill treatment we received. I'm guessing they were all insulted by the AJ's cake box I brought it in. I ran out of boxes and was in a rush. This is the first and only time I will ever be at Lon's. Never have I been so rudely treated at a restaurant before. I will not recommend them to others.",

Brian the sommelier was so helpful in our choice of wine and extremely a people person. The staff was very attentive and welcoming.

The ambiance is exquisite  and I recommend this jewel to many that ask for the best place in the valley. Thank you to the staff for making our night so memorable. )",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this was not the Lon's my husband and I are used to.    We have continued to go back for dinner service prior to this experience as the wait staff is excellent (our favorite waiter lives part time in the French Polynesia!) and the food is phenomenal.   This was a special occasion for us as well as the other couple as it was both of our first Mother's Day: being pretty regular at Lon's, we knew we would not be disappointed.  This time our party of 7 (including 2 well behaved infants) was seated in the library due to a wedding being held in the courtyard.    Food: not as great as the dinner menu.  Good, not excellent.    Service:  Our waiter was very curt and extremely business like.   He did not offer any \"usual Lon's friendly waiter\" frivolous/polite mealtime chatter.  I was already nervous bringing my child to Lon's and he in no way acknowledged either of the kids; during the entire experience he seemed put off waiting on us.  We attempted to joke with him and he wasn't responsive at all. The only unsolicited statement from him came at the end of our meal \"Hope you ladies have a wonderful Mother's Day\".     I was extremely disappointed. If this was my only basis on which to judge Lon's I would not go back.  However, knowing that the Chef always delivers great dinners (I recommend the tasting menu!), the scenery is beautiful, ambiance of the Courtyard seating is excellent, and the majority of the waiters are awesome, I would recommend to dine for dinner, outside.",

    "text": "I love Lon's!   My boyfriend and I came here during Restaurant week and had a wonderful experience. The grounds here are beautiful. You have to sit on the patio. We decided to come on Wednesday in order to enjoy Wine Wednesday. We sat at the bar for a tasting and the bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable. Our table was ready before we were done with our tasting but the hostess was very courteous and said just to check in with her when we were ready.   For dinner we were seated outside about a half hour before sunset. We each ordered the short rib as a starter, which came with mashed sweet potatoes. It was fabulous. The meat was flavorful and tender and I am not a fan of sweet potatoes but I pretty much licked them off the plate. It was a great combination.   I had the shrimp open faced ravioli for dinner and my boyfriend had the free range chicken. My dish was the perfect portion. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the fava beans and crimini mushrooms were a perfect compliment. My boyfriend is the least adventurous person I know when it comes to food that's why he picked the chicken, but he was blow away by the tenderness and flavor it had.   We both had the chocolate truffle tort with minted berries. It tasted like a half cooked brownie and was so good. And was just enough to satisfy our sweet tooth.   This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner. We didn't feel rushed at all. We had to have spent about 2-2.5 hours here. Outstanding service. I've been wanting to come again and my birthday is just around the corner...  :)",

You can't beat the view from the patio and the brunch with family style sides is great.  Recently went to dinner at Lon's for the first time.  It did not disappoint.  The service was great and the servers had something to tell us about everything on the menu.  When the server accidentally forgot a glass of wine for one of our guests, he immediately claimed that it was on the house.  Everything that was served was excellent and there was a lot of sharing across the table.  A great experience that will have me coming back for more.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner......no matter when you eat at Lon's, you win.",

    "text": "I visited Lon's last night for Restaurant Week with Kristin S. If you don't know where you are going, it is definitely a tricky place to find. It does add to the appeal because it gives the feeling of seclusion which would be appreciated if you were dining on the patio. We decided to sit inside because there was a wait for the patio, but it looked very relaxing and romantic with soft candlelight. The inside is large with many different dining rooms and the decor is all Southwestern. I'm not really into the Southwest as a decorating style, so it was a bit much for me.  For my starter, I had the cucumber, tomato and blue cheese salad...the tomatoes were very fresh and the blue cheese was a nice compliment and did not overpower the salad at all. I had the sea scallop entree. It was a very generous portion as the three scallops that came on the plate were really large. They were not the best scallops I have had (they didn't have that melt in your mouth quality), but they were cooked perfectly and were not gritty. The chocolate truffle tort was a perfectly sized as a dessert, but I didn't eat more than four bites of it because it was much much too rich for me.  Our server Chris was very nice and provided good service. We did sit for awhile while they ran our credit cards, but we found out that was because their credit card machine broke. It would have been nice if they had come over and said it was taking awhile because of machine problems, but that's just a minor complaint. There is complimentary valet which was very quick and polite. Overall I enjoyed Lon's and would go back to sit on the patio and try the regular menu with my husband on a special occasion, like our anniversary.",

I specially described how I wanted it cooked.  I kept asking, since I like it pink but without blood, if that was doable.  I said I would be happy to change order if this might be difficult.  I was guaranteed it would be cooked to order.  It was raw.  They took it back.  I sat there while the other five ate for almost 10 minutes before it was returned.  It came back burnt on the outside and still bloody inside.  The first bite was so salty I had to spit out.  Didn't take a second bite!  They did come and ask if ok but removed after their 'flashlight' proved that it was still bloody.  They did take my meal off the bill BUT!!!...if a Chef can't cook a steak to order...ANY WAY it is ordered...I question the ability!",

    "text": "Tucked away in the hills above Phoenix is Lon's at the Hermosa an authentic southwest boutique hacienda hotel with a classy cowboy chow restaurant.  Upon our arrival, our car was complimentary valet parked so that we were able to walk straight into the reception area.  The dining area is outfitted in warm browns and reds with padded leather seats and heavy dark wood tables.  The patio is the place to be with its beehive fireplace, fire pit and wrought iron furniture with old fashioned lanterns on the tables.  The sun was setting as we arrived, highlighting the red rock hills and saguaro silhouettes.    The wait staff was very attentive, our water glasses never came close to being empty.  The Sommelier was very helpful in assisting us to navigate the novel-like wine list.  They have bottles ranging from $40 to over $1000, so there is something for everyone.    The food is southwestern style with a cosmopolitan flair.  Think meat and mac and cheese, but add truffles to the mac and cheese and prickly pear barbecue sauce.  We started the american onion soup and guarillo seared ahi tuna.  The tuna was seasoned perfectly and the pesto sauce drizzled on the side of the plate was fantastic.  For mains, we had the beef tenderloin and the duck.  Both meats were done to perfection.  The marionberry balsamic reduction for the duck gave a perfect tart flavor the complimented the sweet potato pancake and savory duck.    One can easily see the the menu is thoughtfully prepared to create a delicate balance the classics with a more modern southwest style.  The presentation was not as clever as the menu presented, but what does that matter when the food is fantastic?  This is not to say that the food was just thrown on the plate, it was presented in more of classic way.    The only downfall of this restaurant is that the tables are a little bit close together.  It is a highly romantic spot and it would be even more so if I couldn't overhear the next tables conversation.  In this respect, the restaurant is a little disappointing.    Lon's is a dessert oasis with a gourmet restaurant.  It's well worth the trip for any occasion.",

As soon as I drove in the valet greeted me with a smile and so did every one else. The wait staff is very nice and helpful if you have any question about the menu.  The place is gorgeous and definitely a date place.  But be prepared to spend money but it is totally worth it. I had the grilled beef tenderloin that was cooked to perfection.

    "text": "I went to Lon's for a friend's birthday brunch this morning. I had read the great reviews about Lon's and I was very excited to try it. Upon entering- I was so glad to see there was complimentary valet. The valet man was very nice and gracious. I went inside and was seated with my party. The issue was they separated our party into two tables. I didn't even get to sit with my friend to celebrate her birthday. They said this was all they could do and we all were understanding. Our service is the reason why this review is getting a lower rating. There were about 10 of us and I understand with bigger parties everything takes a bit longer- however, 2 hours of a wait to get our food is absolutely ridiculous. Also, our server confused everyone and almost had everyone get the \"hacienda brunch\" which would be around $30 a person. Whereas we thought we were just getting 1 monkey bread for each table.He hardly checked on us as well. We ordered soon after- my friend who was sitting next to me wanted to order off the lunch menu and the server said it was no problem. I ordered the omelet with ham cheese and asparagus. About 30 mins after we all had ordered- the server comes up to my friend and says they cannot make her lunch order after all. I do not understand why it would take 30 mins after we ordered for him to notify her. She reordered and then we waited and waited for our food. When our food finally arrived everything seemed in order except a girl who was sitting at the other table found a hair in her Eggs Benedict. Since the server never came around, I think she just dealt with it. My bite of monkey bread and the omelet were both good. The last hurdle my group had to deal with was the check. The server didn't separate it by table or put gratuity on it and it was just a big mess. I just threw in a $20 bill even though that was like a 6 dollar tip that the server did not deserve. I honestly just wanted to get out of there. As I went to get my car from the valet guy, I noticed it was parked right in the front and all of the windows were about half way down. I didn't put the windows down nor did I ask him to do this. I know the valet guy was probably just trying to help but it's AZ and it is going to be hot regardless. All in all this was one of the worst brunch experiences I have ever encountered and although their monkey bread was yummy I highly doubt I will ever be back due to the poor service we received.",

But sitting outside at Lon's for dinner reminds me of why the area can be great.   We sat outside and could see the light change on a nearby mountain as the sun went down. It was perfectly quiet as we enjoyed our wine (ever notice how a little traffic noise invades so much outdoor seating? Not here) and conversation.  The food was fantastic:  apps (crabcakes, scallops with truffled risotto, two perfect salads) and entrees (sea bass, a lovely duck with a orange-mole--sounds odd bit it really worked, ancho rubbed pork tenderloin & pork belly). All great.   Service was good and a couple subtleties worth noting. Complementary valet parking is a really nice touch I hardly ever see. And the sommolier has a really good manner--helpful not pretentious, made picking wine enjoyable not a test (good, diverse wine list too).  I'd go back in an instant.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I went to Lon's for a romantic date night at sunset. He picked Lon's because there are many sources saying it's a great place to watch an Arizona sunset which we found out is simply not True but the food was delicious & the evening lovely.   - Sunset: Yes worthy of it's own review because this place is lauded as a top place to watch it. We were given the best table in the house for watching the sunset...but you can't see much of the sunset or mountains over all the brush and other stuff out there. We even went outside and wandered around the property at sunset to find a better vantage point, but no luck. I will give props to the great service at Lons - our server told us to just head out and he'd put our food orders in when we returned. - Stuffed Squash Blossoms: This was a special appetizer on their prix fixed menu, and it was amazing! Not only was there the squash blossom stuffed with delicious creamy warm cheese, but the entire stem was attached and fried as well. I've never had squash blossom stem and found it to be delightful, like a firmer zucchini. The salad underneath was dressed with a tangy creamy vinagrette that perfectly complemented the squash. So good! - Bread Platter: Complimentary and so good! Hands down our favorite was the cornbread - super buttery and moist with a kick of heat. Awesome. - Roasted Vegetable Quinoa Salad: A special not on the menu choice for vegetarians and I loved it. Earthy red quinoa mixed with perfectly roasted veggies drizzled with a grassy olive oil. - Pork: My boyfriend had this and enjoyed it. The creamed corn that came with the dish was delicious. - Truffled Papas Fritas: Awesome truffle fries. They used enough truffle oil so each bite really tastes like it.  - Prickly Pear Margarita: I'm calling this drink out because it was way too sweet and gave me a bit of an upset stomach. If you don't like sweet drinks, beware of this one.  I doubt that we'd return for another meal (if the sunsets were more spectacular than it would be worth the price) but it is a lovely date spot and is definitely worth going to at least once.",

    "text": "Was treated by my sister and bro-in-law to an outing here recently.  I was really looking forward to it, which if you read enough of my reviews I have huge issues fulfilling the prophecy.  The setting is beautiful.  Really.  6 or 7 stars worthy.  Service -- waiter was awesome, personable but not annoying.  Check-in, bartender, all excellent.  I don't think my water glass dipped below an inch all night.  The only slightly off thing was the bus boy (bus man?) trying to collect about 10 plates at the end of our meal, on a single trip, one plate stacked on top of the other.  I decided that he is secretly part of the circus and famous for carrying 20 plates at once. Great for the circus, slightly odd for a restaurant at this price point.  Our dinner party sat down for dinner about 8:15 pm.  Five people, apps, entree and a couple shared deserts, pacing was pefect but at 10:15 pm it was us and another table.  Is this odd?  Is this really an early bird special- type place? I don't know.  Why am I mentioning this?  Not sure.  I had the crab cake appetizer, very good, but served with a dollop of guacamole on top.  The guac was delicious but I just thought it was an odd combination.  I feel like an asshole.    For the entree I had the veal wrapped in proscuitto, cooked medium rare as recommended by the chef.  The outside sear on the meat was perfect.  Really.  I felt like I finally understand what celebrity chefs are talking about on the food network when they mention a \"perfect sear\".  However, the rest of the meat, eh.  Felt like I was chewing rubber bands.  I feared that I might knock my plate off the table trying to cut it.  I don't eat veal often (read: maybe once before if that).  Considering there are starving children in Africa -- hell, right down the street, I feel like an asshole for complaining about a $35 undercooked?  overcooked?  incorrectly cooked? cut of veal.    I could see myself returning for brunch on a special occasion but I'm not sure I would agree with some of the other raves here on Yelp.",

    "text": "I've been going to Lon's for over 20 years and I can honestly say, it has gone downhill rapidly. The service was inattentive at best and my food was not ok.  I ordered their ribeye and it was 50% fat.  If you order a 20oz steak you don't expect 50% to be fat, no matter what the cut is!!  When I mentioned it to waiter he just looked at me and walked away!!! As a positive side note, the desert and appetizers were great.  The couple we were with asked for additional veggies and was told it was \"garnish\" and that's all that came with his $60 steak.  Just s few side notes, the we waited until diner had been served for 10min before the wine that we ordered was brought to the table.  Just little details like not having 20 customers waiting in the lobby for 10 minutes while the host was having a conversation with whom appeared to be the manager.  I found it unacceptable , as did most folks that were waiting.  As a person that doesn't expect to be ignored when you arrive, training from the \"manager\" on down is lacking.  Lons always represented great service and repeat business and they missed it..I can think of other places to spend top dollar and receive better service and food.  I had the opportunity to open my to go box and the waiter (Britt) put all the fat and all the waste into the box!! It's just the icing on the cake!  I now feel compelled to tell everyone I know!

Even the valet seemed to expect us and knew our name, we had a lovely table outdoors with a card on our table signed by all the  staff. I told my wife I think at least 10 people working there came by to wish us a happy anniversary. They get EXCELLENT Customer service right!   The food was delicious, we had two different salads which were great, wild mushroom and wedge. We ordered sea bass and the special which was scallops. We had three sides: Brussel Sprouts, truffle fries and broccolini. Everything was terrific and we were not stuffed and had a great overall experience.

    "text": "I was referred by a co-worker to enjoy dinner here, so while visiting Scottsdale we made reservations to enjoy their chef's menu in the cellar.  We (as two couples) arrived and were promptly greeted by the hostess and then taken to the cellar for our dinner.  We had an amazing table right in the middle of this quaint room, adorned with wine racks (filled with wine) all around us.  The room has exposed rock walls, brick floors and timber framing - truly sets the proper setting for enjoying a great wine-paired chef's menu!  Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us makes selections of an extra bottle of wine, as well as going into detail explained each of the many courses of our incredible dinner.  Each course was prepared perfectly!  Each bite was full of amazing flavor and the wine pairing matched each course perfectly.  We enjoyed each bite and sip!  Each course was plated so very beautifully!  I could go on and on about each course and how amazing the filet was, but you'll need to experience it for yourself.  The restaurant itself is beautiful!  Upstairs are a couple of larger rooms for private groups and they perfectly sized to accommodate most business groups for an amazing dinner.  We can't speak highly of Lon's at the Hermosa.... We definitely look forward to returning!",

    "text": "Lon's is the restaurant nestled in at The Hermosa in the beautiful scenic Paradise Valley part of Scottsdale. The Hermosa is a bouquet resort.  My review is based on only one lunch visit and I note I have a habit of checking out nice places for lunch before I decide to invest in dinner.  We entered and I was blown away with how nice and friendly the host and hostess were. It was a joy to get seated. The weather was just right for patio dining so we sat on the comfortable patio with mature trees and desert views.  Our waiter is also kind and friendly introduces himself and takes our order when we are ready. During out stay he was very attentive and also offered many beverage refills.  Soon I receive my plate of Fish and Chips. The fish is Halibut and is fresh tasting, moist and flaky just like it should be. My plate included a house made sauce and the tastiest freshest house made herbed fries I remember having in a while. This wasn't a fancy plate at all but everything on it was fresh and technically perfect.  My husband had the short rib pizza. He said the short rib was very good and the pizza was smeared with house made ricotta cheese that added great flavors. I stole a tomato from the pizza and it was so sweet with a fresh picked tomato taste. My husband said the pizza was really very good and very tasty. The only criticism that I can add is that the pizza runs on the small side for a man's appetite.   We also were made to feel very welcome by the manager who also offered to get us anything.  Typical of all resorts the lunch pricing runs on the high side.  You might need to know that they are without self parking so you do use a valet.  Lon's accepts Preferred Scottsdale Dining Cards this year (Fall 2016- Summer2017) so if you have the card one meal will be deducted from your check.",

Servers are casual but they do a great job keeping the drinks going and the cutlery replaced as required.    The Easter brunch is a 3 course with monkey bread.  Love monkey bread and this was no exception.  The one iffy part is that they brought the monkey bread 2 minutes before our appetizer, yet we had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes.  Overall the food came out at a somewhat slow pace.  It was a beautiful Sunday so not much of an issue except that the food wasn't exactly cooked properly.  The eggs on my crab benedict were under cooked (thank goodness for that raw egg menu warning) and the beef tenderloin we ordered medium was still mooing.    We did get some nice photos in front of the flowers.",

They have a beautiful outdoor patio, that I would highly recommend for a brunch (you'll get great photos from it, trust me). At night, the lights and Christmas decorations set the perfect ambiance for an evening dinner.   I'm a huge sucker for braised short ribs (it's my go to at any restaurant that offers them), and Lon's does not disappoint! The meat is tender, full of flavor and falls apart easily with a fork. You can also never go wrong with a side of mac & cheese either!   Last night, I tried something new and ordered their \"Local Bison Duo\". It came with 3oz of short ribs and cocoa-rubbed Tenderloin. Shockingly, the short rib portion of the dish was not the star... it had a strange taste that tasted too gamey and wine-y. The tenderloin on the other hand was fantastic. It was cooked to the right consistency and super juicy. It paired well with the parsnip puree and brussels on the plate.   I love the cowboy decor in the restaurant - it creates a homey/nostalgic feeling of Old Arizona, which makes for a great dining environment if it's too cold outside. Whether you're out on the patio or inside, Lon's friendly staff and hearty food (also their mini cornbread bites) will make sure you and your dinner party enjoy yourselves!",

The rest of the moon pie was delicious as was the salted caramel ice cream.  They were very busy and we had other places to be, so we opted not to mention our disappointment to our delightful server.

    "text": "Ok. So the food is excellent and the historic location amazing. But, our last visit caused us to take 2 stars off of what our rating would've been. 1. We expected this waiter to give a free anniversary desert, esp since it was mentioned a second time after the desert menu was brought to us. The waiter gave us a half nod. One desert was brought to share for two. AND it was a minuscule desert!! About a quarter of what I would expect for a portion. So we were extra surprise to be charged $11 for this mini desert !! We asked the waiter once again and he acted surprised we had expected a free desert. WELL, we got a desert one time for a birthday so I don't know.  2. The portion size of the sea bass was obviously an end portion and smaller than the one of the other portions. They said they would replace it, but I think they must've brought the SAME piece back cause it was small as well!! I know the portions aren't meant to be huge, but I'm not sure what happened.  This place is usually very good",

It was the first food item I ordered.  The first bite was heaven!! It was surely rich and flavorful but not too sweet.  I ordered the steak sliders and potatoes.  It came with an order of toast which was odd.  I enjoyed the sliders but the potatoes were a bit overcooked.  A couple of people in my party were not happy with their food, especially because there was a long hair in her eggs.  Everyone enjoyed the food except for the service.  Our waiter kept pushing on us getting the Hacienda Brunch.   I don't enjoy being pushed to order something I don't want.  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant but I think I would like to experience a better waiter.",

While you're waiting cozy up to the bar where one of the friendly bartenders will serve you up an expertly mixed concoction tailored to your liking.  It is a more quiet atmosphere and my date and I were the youngest people there, but no worries. The food is very fresh with herbs from their onsite, organic garden. I had a nice piece of filet with some awesomely prepared kale. She had duck which was tasty and prefectly crisp.   All in all a pleasant evening with good food, the ambiance is what really makes the occassion. A special hats off to the server who had to deal with the obnoxious cougar behind me who would not shut up and give it a rest about the foie gras...that poor fellow had the patience of a saint.....my date wanted to take a knife and cut her.",

The food is very good, but is truly trumped by the ambiance which is romantic in a adobe wrapped authentic way.  Even though there are many patrons dining, and even close by, you still feel very intimate with your date, friend, or small party.    The grounds outdoors by the water fountain are idyllic.  The bar staff inside was very friendly and a pleasure to be around.  The wine cellar downstairs, which I believe can be booked for private dinners, was magnificent.  My friend and I snuck down there to check it out after dinner, and it was an amazing discovery.    So far, this has been the best ambiance for dining I've found in Scottsdale.  Anything you get there will taste better because of the aura of the establishment.",

Lons is a great, romantic (albeit pricey) restaurant and if we owned that house up on Camelback mtn, i'm sure we'd be regulars!",

My husband got the brunch with Huevos Rancho and I the Short Rib Hash. His was good but alittle blah and my poached eggs were hard boiled.

It was our anniversary and we hadn't been to Lon's before--- we were greeted by our names by a host who had grown up next door and used to play on one of the trees in their courtyard. He sat us at a table where Deacon, our server congratulated us on our anniversary and gave us the rundown on the menu.  We had the squash blossoms to start and they were perfectly cooked-- crispy on the outside, cheesy goodness on the inside. The hubs had a salad with chocolate balsamic dressing-- it was to die for. I had the ceviche which was a perfect complement to the warm evening. We made our way through some Cloudy Bay and then Deacon suggested the Black Chicken zinfandel for our main courses. I had the short ribs-- serious melt in your mouth- not heavy or too filling. Just perfect. The hubs sprang for pork 3 ways which is a great showcase of the kitchens abilities!   Wine was a perfect complement and I got the peach dessert - local peaches ripe and tasty. The lights around the patio twinkled and we left feeling like we had an epic Phoenix night.",

The caesar salad looked hearty with the added chicken (shared with me) but was WAY overdressed.  The superfood salad with bacon was a hit and delicious!

The grounds were beautiful. All of the landscaping seemed brighter than usual. Just beware that the grounds pool is not far from the patio, so you might get some partially dressed residents/guests during your time there.   Service: Exceptional. My water never got below 1/3, which is hard because I drink water like it's going out of style. The food came out pretty quickly too. I also love that they'll box your food at your table. I don't know why but I prefer that over the the waiter taking it back to the kitchen to box up.   Food, omg the food: I started with the tortilla soup. It was creamy, spicy without being killer hot, and full of southwest herbs. The chicken was right off the grill and cut into small strips. Tortilla strips to give it a crunch, and a dollop of fresh guacamole at the bottom as a small surprise at the end. For my entree, I had the grilled vegetable panini on foccacia. It was full of seasonal veggies (i.e. roasted peppers, asparagus, portobello, caramelized onions) with melted mozzarella. Savory and surprisingly not messy. It was served with an apple slaw (perfect for this time of year) and a mixed green salad which was better than any other mixed green salad I've ever had. Just plain exceptional.  Tip: Get the tortilla soup and sit outside if weather permits.",

It's hard to remember how much imports, domestics, wine, wine flights, etc are when they're just rattled off to you by the bartender/server...   HUGE PLUS- On Wednesdays there's a free cheese/berry board to munch on during HH.   Location is beautiful. I think I'll go back for a dinner in the courtyard area, but probably not for HH...

Food was good but for the price I can think of a few other places I enjoy more.  Bottom line, if you have guests in town and you want them to have a regional experience, Lons is a good and safe choice.",

    "text": "At the risk of sounding like Yogi Berra for malaprop, our experience at Lon's was so excellent we can't go there ever again!  Let us explain.  We were four for dinner on a lovely Arizona winter evening with early reservations for patio seating just as dusk was starting to appear and become evening.  From the moment we arrived at Lon's to be warmly met and seated to the top notch service by our wait person, the personal attention from the front of house staff was great.  Wait staff knew the menu to answer questions and make recommendations both, had food delivered just at the right time - not too early or too late - and was friendly without being familiar.  Just right.   The casually elegant (or is it elegantly casual) ambiance of the patio with dwindling sunlight turning the hills purple, the fireplace burning and the nicely quiet setting (deliver us from pounding music in restaurants) was simply perfect.  As was the food.    Between the four of us we split two starters, had four creative, wonderfully prepared entrees ranging from pork to fish to vegetarian choices, enjoyed a great bottle of wine, had two cups of coffee and split a delectable dessert four ways (come on now...you've done it too :-) ) and we thought the bill was very reasonable, all things considered for quality of food, ambiance and evening's entertainment, at about $55 each before tip.     In fact, our evening with friends at Lon's was so perfect that each of the four of us has said we're not sure that we could go back because we can't imagine them being able to get the experience so right a second time.  Then again, why not?    We highly recommend visitors to the Phoenix / Scottsdale area include dinner or lunch (or both) at Lon's in their plans.",

    "text": "We traveled to Phoenix to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and Lon's At the Hermosa was recommended for dining on our anniversary.  We were in Phoenix for 8 nights and this was hands down the worst meal on our trip. It is actually the worst meal we have had in a long time and it was twice the cost of other 5 star meals we had on our trip.  My husband called and made the reservation and let them know it was our 25th wedding anniversary.  When we arrived they didn't have a table in the main dining room and sat us in a smaller room that was decorated cowboy style.  They didn't seem to think a 25th wedding anniversary was a special occasion as they didn't do a thing to mark the occasion for us.  When we were inquiring about restaurants with the concierge prior to our trip we were told that it was very romantic but just because you turn the lights on dim doesn't mean it is romantic - it was far from romantic.    The food was barely edible.  The heads and tentacles were left on the shrimp in my soup.  How does one reach into a bowl of soup and remove the tentacles and heads off of the shrimp ...I couldn't eat it and my husband quickly took the heads away.  My steak was flavorless and tasted boiled and  the potatoes were burnt (black).  I only ate a few bites.  It was supposed to be prepared with a pecan crust but there was no pecan crust.  My husband's chicken dish was so bad he left most of it on the plate and the waitress never even asked if our dinners were to our liking.  They really ruined our anniversary celebration.  I don't recommend this restaurant at all but especially not for a special occasion.  It was so disappointing.  You only get one 25th anniversary celebration and you really want it to be special...this was not.",

My strawberry chicken salad had minimal spinach leaves, the smoked chicken was repulsive--it looked days old--and the cubes (yes cubes) of peppered feta were terrible!!  And the chef's special \"chocolate vinaigrette\" (Yikes!) was not tolerable.  One of my guests commented that they didn't realize it was possible to destroy eggs Benedict, but that Lon's had succeeded!  When they brought a \"special\" birthday dessert, it was a concrete brownie, that we couldn't cut.  The service was attentive--but just mediocre.  I shared my disappointment with several others; and they commented that they had heard the same about Lon's from several folks--beautiful grounds but definite problems with the chef....too bad; it used to be wonderful several years ago...I remember.",

    "text": "Lovely. That is the best word to describe this place. Everything about it is lovely: the food, the service, and especially the setting.   I went here for brunch at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday and expected to have a long wait for table (especially since it was a warm and sunny day in January) but we arrived and the place was practically empty. We got to choose our table and enjoy a relaxing meal.   The service was fantastic. From the complimentary valet, the hostess, our waiter, and busser. They were all professional, courteous, and attentive without being pushy.   We both really liked our food, starting with the banana bread they bring to your table. He went with the steak and eggs (that come with poached eggs on a corn muffin with hollandaise sauce...good lord) and I opted for the three egg omelet minus the shrimp (corn, peppers, spinach, cheese) and they both came with their potatoes (sweet and regular, cubed and seasoned). It was presented well, tasted great, and left us feeling full but not heavy.   Now, all of that is fine and good...but what you should really come here for is the setting. We sat in the outside courtyard and it was just so picturesque (it reminded me a lot of the Arizona Inn in Tucson). Southwesterny without being over the top, brick patio, lots of trees, colorful flowers, fountains, and green grass.   I think this would be a great place for brunch, date night, dinner with your family, rehearsal dinner, and even small wedding. I would also love giving the Hermosa Inn a whirl because it looks very charming.",

Some reviews has said the staff ignored their special events here, but we didn't find that to be the case at all.  The food was very good. Not great.  Not for the prices paid.  But a stroll around the hotel gardens after dinner was quite nice. I'd like to back when the weather is cooler and eat outside on the patio - that looked very pretty.",

We love rib-eye, so when we saw it on the menu we knew what we would order. The aroma was amazing but the steak itself, chewy and over charred. Come on!!!  For sides Amy had the mac & cheese.  Salty and OK but not great.  The broccoli, OK but not great!  Same with the mashed potatoes.  It was a beautiful restaurant by left disappointed.",

I did make an online reservation through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and even added a note that I would like to be seated outside near the KYOT set-up.  Arrived, mentioned my reservations, and was immediately seated INSIDE.  Waited at least ten minutes before I was given a glass of iced water.  Another 5 minutes passed by before my server introduced herself to me.  I asked if I may be seated outside since this was my main reason for dropping by- to be able to enjoy my meal outdoors, with KYOT's smooth sounds surrounding me.  I was soon placated.  Vacillated between blueberry buckwheat pancakes and Lon's burger entree.  Asked for server's recommendation and was told to go for the pancakes.  Had a few of Lon's delicious signature pastries.  Especially favored the raspberry pastry and the chocolate croissants!!  In the meantime, other patrons were being handed delicious-looking entrees.  Made me wish I'd ordered the burger.  I did enjoy the buckwheat pancakes, although I wished there were more of the blueberry compote.  Kind of pricey for me, though.  Definitely paying for the atmosphere.  I would make sure to eat outdoors to take advantage of the lovely setting,",

The place has a great outdoor area and a nice wine list.  We ordered 3 pigs as an appetizer and it was mediocre at best.  The pork loin had very little taste but a good sauce, the pork belly was fatty and the cheeks were good.  Both the manager and the waiter asked  about the dish and when we truthfully told them that it was average and disappointing there was no response.  I think they said that they would tell the chef! I wasn't looking for a comp, but if you are going to ask the question and listen to the response, you should make some sort of effort to rectify. (Replace the dish, comp the meal, or buy a dessert)   On a $250 dinner, it's the least that you can do.  We split the chicken and the duck and it was a nice presentation and they split the plates in the kitchen which was a nice touch.  Chicken was good but not exceptional as we were led to believe.  Duck was very good and was definitely the highlight of the night.  I doubt I would return. It wasn't a bad meal, it was just okay food with a great bottle of wine, good service  and great ambiance and not inexpensive.  Sanctuary the night before was far superior at a similar price point.",

Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for...   I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in.",

I am vegetarian and they had no vegetarian options on the menu besides a side of Brussels Sprouts and a side of Mashed Potatoes, which is exactly what I ordered. Normally you can't go wrong with either, but the Brussels Sprouts were under cooked with no flavor- I paid $200 for a meal in which I ate a side of mashed potatoes.   The service was good, and our waiter was good. My boyfriend said his fish was good but not great. The only reason we gave 2 stars rather than 1 was because the service was good, the wine was good, and that's about it.",

All the people are very accommodating and extremely helpful. The patio is a perfect setting for a nice, quiet (and romantic) dinner and their sitting area by the fireside is a perfect place to end your evening with an after dinner drink.

Haha but definitely worth it!!   I had to bring my hubby here because he's never been even though I've dined here twice. We decided to make reservations for date night around 5:30p. It was the perfect weather at the perfect restaurant. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated because we were early so we sat at the patio and I ordered a painkiller while hubby ordered a beer. The painkiller was refreshing and we were finally seated outdoors. Live music started playing and it was so romantic, I felt like I was in a movie.  We ordered the calamari, the pork special (split), and the truffle Mac and cheese. Oh my - everything was decadent! The calamari had the perfect seasoning, the pork special had so much flavor and ingredients that went well together, and the Mac and cheese was cooked perfectly (not too hard and not too soft). We were so full that we skipped dessert.  Check came to $87 - if you split a plate, they will charge you $5. Service was great and it was a great date night!!",

It has an amazing location, with old trees, beautiful cactus and flowers everywhere. The patio is perfect, but in many ways the inside is just as nice, like dining in a classy old home.  They do a nice, seasonal tasting menu for $75 that includes a raw course, starter, entree and dessert.  This is an amazing deal that you can choose without the whole table participating. Think oysters, pork belly, and duck. The beauty is that you can also order any of these options a la carte. Last night we had the 16oz Tomahawk Duroc Pork Chop that was perfectly done with a nice mole and apple chutney. The Chicken is simple and perfect with perfectly cheesy mashed potatoes and grilled Broccolini.  The Salmon was perfectly cooked to just opaque in the middle with seared skin, barley, and chunks of chorizo.  The filet was crusted with pecans and served over a dense potato cake with Nueske bacon and and a reduced red wine sauce.  Nicely creamed greens finished this dish. A side of sweet and bacons Brussels Sprouts was perfect.  Expect nice cocktails, a great wine list, and unique desserts, although this time we didn't try those.  The service is very polished, but this time was a bit lacking.  Go here and enjoy.  We will be back again and",

The waiter and our busser were both so knowledgeable about the menu, and were very attentive and helpful.   The dining room is relatively small and really lovely.

But yes, I think the overwhelming beauty of the outdoor patio sitting next to the garden was the highlight, as well as the coffee.  Very scrumptious, full-bodied coffee that our lovely server was kind enough to provide us some beans (for home) and the name of it (yes, of course, I have ordered a bag already).  My husband was crazy about the monkey bread, he is from the South, and the soupiness and sheer sweetness made him squeal with delight.  I hope he doesn't read this, LOL.  I don't mean to overlook what I ate, it was delicious as well, particularly the rustic bread it was served on.  I think with Lon's you need to expect to spend some time there....they can get really busy and elegance just takes time.  Which Lon's has lots of....I will certainly be hoping to go again for brunch before the weather takes a turn for the 100's...",

We were seated by the Manager who pulled out my birthday friend's chair and also failed to push it in.  He never mentioned the birthday.  Our waitress Frenchie, was not extremely pleasant, as if a 60-65 year old still had menopause!  We ordered and asked for veggie substitutions which she claimed they do not substitute for ANYTHING!  The service was extremely slow, especially waiting for drinks from the bar.  Frenchie claimed that the bartender was slow,  Her attitude got in the way of celebrating a special event.  She did manage to put a candle in the birthday girl's dessert but never offered a \"Happy Birthday.\"  She charged twice for refills to soda.  The quality of the food was less than mediocre for high prices.  On the way out, I mentioned our experience to the manager Martk Kieru.  He took notes, including my phone number, but never called or followed through with me.    The entire experience was NOT a good one.  I would NOT recomment Lon's to anyone.  As a matter of fact, I would recommend that people stay clear of Lon's and their poor service and mediocre quality of food.",

While the service was just okay, the food was just terrible.  Keep in mind this was a Christmas Day prix fixe menu at $68/pp, which by Phoenix standards should be the best meal I've had all year.  Appetizers - some sort of sushi thing that was drowned in seaweed, tasted okay but was barely noticeable on the plate.  Also a lobster cake which was okay, came out cold, and wasn't nearly as good as the worst crab cake I've ever had.  Entrees - prime rib came out cold, and I've had better at a cheap buffet carving station.  Veal scallopini was chewy (kind of like a microwaved sponge), and had the most tasteless mozzarella cheese I've ever had.  When we brought this to the attention of the waitress, she asked that they remake all of our food.  About a half hour later we got a better (still not good) version of the veal, and opted to try the ravioli instead of the prime rib they had run out of.  At least the veal came out hot this time.  The ravioli wasn't bad, but probably had more oil than any other ingredient.  I felt greasy after eating it, which was a shame.  Neither of our meals seemed to have any inspiration or fresh ingredients whatsoever.  Desserts - what a sin.  I wonder if this place pays a pastry chef?  I'm spoiled by my step mom's bread pudding, so I understand when others don't step up to the plate, but the bread pudding here is something I would never waste a calorie on again.  And my \"apple pie\" was simply a joke.  It was clearly canned filling that they didn't even bother to heat, stuffed inside a dry pie shell that tasted like a mouth full of flour.  Ugh!  Our waitress sent the manager over, and he initially came off as unapologetic and insulted that we were unhappy.  He had to go to the table right next to us a few minutes later.  After we waited 20 minutes for our check, he came back again in a slightly better mood.  He explained that the kitchen was tired after being there since the morning and had lost their creativity.  OK I get it, I was tired too, but what kind of creativity do you need to heat up an unimaginative, standard menu?  The night ended with our two glasses of wine and one of our two meals comped.  It was the right thing to do, although I still don't feel like we received nearly a $70 meal.  With so many other locally-focused and inspired restaurants all over the valley, I would certainly recommend against dinner at Lon's.  If I were to go back, it would only be for a glass of wine out on the patio (although I can list a few places I'd rather go for that, too).",

    "text": "Restaurant Week makes writing reviews complicated. Restaurants lower their prices during this 7-day period (a three-course meal runs you $29 per person) in order to gain new customers and fill spots during less-popular dining times. At places like Lon's or Cowboy Ciao, guests end up getting meals that would normally cost $50 or more per person for a mere $29. Knowing that I got a much-more expensive meal at a bit of a discount definitely makes me want to give Lon's a higher rating.   At the same time, however, my husband and I were discussing that we would have been disappointed with our experience *had we paid* twice the price. And since people reading this review may not have the good fortune of going to Lon's during the RW, when prices are lower than normal, I'm going to have to give the restaurant 3 stars. This is based on the food not being that flavorful or impressive given the prices they normally charge.   We started the meal with Absolut martinis, which were pricey at $12 each and contained vermouth even though we asked for them \"dry.\" Since we, just like Joel L, thought that spare ribs was a strange starter but both wanted to try them, we decided to pick a starter off the regular menu. We both love duck, so we ordered the salad with the seared duck. It wasn't great. We liked that it had pine nuts but found the dressing to be overwhelming acidic and were disappointed by the four pepperoni-shaped, paper-thin, and bland-tasting duck pieces.   The disappointment continued with the spare ribs. I loved the sweet potato puree that accompanied them but found the ribs themselves to be a bit dry and not all that flavorful. The \"carrot jus\" was not detectable (or if it was, didn't add much), and we were dismayed to see that the listing for the same ribs on the regular menu said that the meat came with \"ancho chile chocolate sauce.\" How sad that the RW version of the ribs didn't have the opportunity to be dressed up in a more flavorful sauce!  For my entree, I ordered the pan-roasted scallops with the roasted pepper spaetzle, organic spinach, and the corn jus. My husband doesn't care for scallops much, but I found them to be well-cooked and not too metallic or gritty (as bad scallops can be). The sides, especially the spaetzle, were interesting and pretty flavorful. I could definitely taste that the spinach was organic. I also had a glass of wine with my entree and did appreciate the pairings listed on the RW menu next to each course, which made it easy to quickly choose an appropriate wine.    My husband had the open-faced shrimp ravioli. We both loved the concept and again, found the vegetables to be really fresh and tender. However, we didn't taste anything resembling lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretty over-cooked. The portion was small, which we usually don't mind if the dish is high-end and super-flavorful, but that wasn't really the case here.   In terms of desserts, the lemon tarte was just ok (and actually reminded me of those lemon bars you make from a boxed mix), but the chocolate truffle torte with the minted berries was outstanding. Since we weren't blown away by any of the other dishes we had tried, it was really nice to end the meal with a delicious, rich dessert.   I am glad to have had a romantic meal in a beautiful patio setting for only $29 per person, but again, we would have been quite disappointed with Lon's food had we gone and paid regular prices for everything ($25+ for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappointing).  That being said, I can't reiterate how peaceful and unique the patio setting is, and the service was certainly professional and attentive (the bus boys did an especially nice job of keeping the table clean and re-filling water glasses). The atmosphere and service may make me want to go back at some point (maybe on someone else's dime!) and give Lon's food another try.   One final note - Lon's does take reservations through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> although the email confirmation requested that we call the restaurant directly in order to secure patio seating, so I would suggest making direct contact with the restaurant if it really matters to you to sit on the patio.",

Gorgeous view of Camelback Mountain and a patio I'd like to have in my backyard. We started off w/some foie gras and seared shrimp appetizers and both were terrific. We then split a grilled chicken sandwich. Yummy! The staff is fun and friendly. I love an interactive and thoughtful waiter staff!! I noted in the reservation it was our anniversary and they had a nice surprise for us at the end of our meal. The only thing I can complain about is my own fault and that's having not gone there at sunset as it's supposed to be s great place for that. We'll get there though, otherwise, kudos! Kudos and kudos!!!",

    "text": "My fiancee and I visited Lon's at the Hermosa on a Friday night in June to celebrate our anniversary and was a perfect location for a little romance under the calm, star-cloaked Arizona sky in a pocket of wilderness within the sprawling Phoenix metro.   Lon's provided one of the most inspired meals I've had in quite a while, beginning expeditiously with a world-class wine list, representative of various renowned grape-squeezing regions as the Pacific Coast, Italy, France, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.  After a quick consult with a very capable sommelier who spirited us with an impressive explanation of Portuguese reds, we agreed on a bottle on Golfo [?], which may or may not be the correct name, as it smartly inoculated us after two and a half glasses each.  Mmm!  In place of a starter, we ordered two unique salads: Mine was a seared duck salad on baby greens with toasted pine nuts an a white vinaigrette.  It was ingenious ... but not quite as ingenious as the scallop salad my fiancee had.  They were absolutely the best-prepared scallops either of us had ever experienced.  What is even more amazing is that the salads were surpassed in flavor by the entrees, which sometimes flops as a headliner to gourmet starters.  Not the case here.  My sun dried tomato crusted rack of lamb was prepared excellently and the crust paired with the tender, juicy lamb chops (4) was easily skyrocketed into the top 3 list of things I've ever tasted.  The goat cheese herb grits were a perfect, and light compliment .. and something I've truly never seen on a menu before, much less experienced by taste.    My fiancee's grilled filet of salmon with blackberry barbeque glaze was very much an original as well.  Even for someone who is not a gigantic fan of salmon, such as myself, really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  She very much enjoyed it.  For dessert, we had the sorbet sampler as a means of cooling off from our frenetic eating/drinking pace.  Although very delicious, it was a mistake on my part as there was a sampler of tiramasu/creme brulee/pote de chocolate.  Ugh.  What was I thinking bypassing this delicious plate of hyperglycemia?  Well, there's always next time.  It also must be noted, the stellar service we received.  The server was absolutely charming, gracious, and accommodative, referring to us by name, refilling our water/wine glasses, and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information, they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch].  Overall, it was a place worthy of a very special occasion, and one which I would not hesitate to return to so that we can experience the rest of their impressive menu.",

Seemed like this place was really for the people staying there and not so much for locals.  Plus the food was small proportions which was ok as it was not that great.

I wanted to try every single thing they offered.  So we went with the 5-course \"trust\" menu - good choice.  We started with a fabulous light and fresh tomato salad.  Then came seared Ahi with avocado (the fish was a bit overdone for me, but I like my ahi raw).  That was followed by a seared scallop with pesto, lamb with a delicious wine reduction, and refreshing little lemon tarts for dessert.  None of the wine pairings were particularly memorable, but they were all well-suited to the food.  The bad: The service.  Now, I grew up in AZ so I know things are a bit more laid back there, service is more casual, etc. - but this was ridiculous.  Our server seemed unhappy that we were choosing the tasting menu and tried to dissuade us, as if we didn't know it would take extra time.  When we held fast, she sort of sighed and got it started.  Not one dish was described when it was dropped, so we never knew what the sauces and garnishes were.  After clearing my plate before my mom's, the backserver just hovered next to her, waiting for her to take her last bite and grabbed the plate while she was chewing.  Also, everything was slooooow.  I mean, not a relaxing tasting pace, but a slow \"kitchen forgot about us\" pace.   I had really been looking forward to trying Lon's - I had heard such great things.  While the food did not disappoint, the service certainly did, and that really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope management picks up the pace at this place!",

As I walked into the restaurant, I first had to walk through the beautiful patio..wishing that my party had reserved to sit out there, but greatful we did not because it had to be Scottsdale coldest evening in a year!  The Ambiance of the restaurant was great, yes it was romantic but yet still inviting for larger parties.  We had a bottle of Champagne and Pinot Noir which was recommended by the sommelier.  For dinner, I had the pan roasted alaskan halibut  and the truffle scented mac and cheese...The halibut was nicely prepared and had a wonderful flavor.  The truffle scented mac and cheese was cold and not as tasteful as I hoped.  It was a disappointment.  For desert, we decided on the Chocolate cake with vanilla malt.    Overall, Lon's was a nice dining experience.  The only reason I would go back to the restaurant is for the outdoor patio.",

We made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday Evening and requested a table outside on the patio (Thanks to the great yelp advice) which was essential, you have to be on the patio when the weather allows.  So there we were seated, looking out of the quintessential south western landscape and off to the peak in the distance as the sun set across it.  The service was spectacular.  Almost too frequent of \"check up.\"  You're not rushed at all because they aren't turning the tables on the balcony, the last seating is at 6:45.  The food was delicious, we had seared ahi tuna that tasted just right, and split an entree of a sea bass special.  Perfectly cooked.  We finished with a dense chocolate cake.  But we weren't really finished, not with the sun having seat and the fire place casting a glow.  We paid the check and spotted two great seats next to a fire pit.  The weather was perfect for it, just a slight chill in the air while we enjoyed some cool white wine.  I could see this place as a creating a super great romantic evening, as we did, but also coming for drinks with friends enjoying the night air, or in the winter, the inside is divided much like a lounge.  Great Vibe, great time... Lon's got it!",

    "text": "Let me start on a positive note. This is a charming restaurant. We arrived at 6:45 and our table was ready. When I made the reservation I let them know we had 2 vegetarians and that both couples were celebrating our 20th anniversaries. I wasn't very hungry so I decided to order a side of roasted summer squash.  I love squash but this was hardly edible, the skin was tough and the insides were mushy, I set the squash aside and ate the tomatoes and corn that were drowning in some white creamy sauce, there was supposed to be feta on this but I did not see it or taste it. Two people in of our party ordered the Taste of Summer.  They started with the crab stuffed squash blossom which lost it's flavor when they fried it.  It tasted like crab rangoon from any old chinese restaurant.  My husband had the roasted Petaluma chicken AZ cheddar mashed potatoes, broccolini, sweet onion jus.  The presentation of the chicken was just weird, it was a skin on chicken breast cut in half then placed over what appeared to be a thigh bone.  The meat was dry, the potatoes were average.  Our other dinner companion had the seared Scottish salmon braised baby fennel & artichokes, olives, citrus jus.  She ate half her meal because she didn't think it was very good.  The salmon was dry and lacked flavor. The one good meal on the table was the Alaskan halibut & Kauai shrimp, local farro, peas, green garlic, shaved radishes, chorizo broth. So if you are going I recommend this one.  The halibut was cooked perfectly and the farro was delicious.  We all tried each other's meals just to see if anything was as good as we had anticipated it would be.  We agreed on the halibut. We asked if there were vegetarian options for this meal (minus the chorizo broth) . Our waiter responded that it wouldn't be a problem and he saw the note that we had 2 vegetarians and 2 anniversaries. If he saw the note we should not have had to ask. However, when we ordered dessert they didn't write Happy Anniversary, light a candle or do anything.  They just brought the desserts out.  Our waiter was never around when we needed something, he appeard to be busy at large table across the room.  I waited 10 minutes to get a refill on my drink.   If this review was based solely on dinner and ambiance, it would easily be 4 stars. However, the service was pretty bad, especially for a $100+ meal. The waiter was friendly but a bit abrupt, beyond slow, and inattentive. Manny the guy who filled the water and cleaned the table was extremely attentive and friendly.  We had to ask him for more bread and to find our waiter at one point. We ordered the cobbler special and received this peach thing that was in a crust so hard someone could have chipped a tooth. Such a shame. It really is quite pretty in the evening with sparkling lights.  This meal was a huge disappointment because we heard so many wonderful reviews about the food & service we had pretty high expectations.  We will return to the resort because it's a beautiful place to get away to but next time I will drive down the street and go to Tarbell's.",

Most disappointing was the Hermosa salad, the foundation of which was, as noted on the menu, \"baby greens\"...it looked like the vines associated with grapes (after the fruit was extracted) and was a challenge to cut and ingest. If that is their namesake salad I will opt for eating dried seaweed on a sun-drenched beach.  Lastly the Sommelier refused to take our initial drink order...Henry Ford would be proud of the \"division of labor\". Ironically, we found it necessary to ask a waiter to open the bottle of wine that we had on ice because we couldn't find the Sommelier. We won't be back!",

    "text": "Contrary to what one reviewer noted, Lon's does fail, especially at this price point.  We've had the pleasure of eating there on two other occasions when the service and culinary creations were spot on.  The current rendition of Lon's leaves much to be greatly desired.  Nutshell, the food and service slightly better than a national chain restaurant. Yes, really.  When we arrived early, we told the hostess that we wanted to enjoy a couple cocktails outside on the patio before dinner. Unfortunately that did not happen due to the very slow bar service with only two bartenders handling the whole restaurant.  One of the managers (which there appeared to be at least three roaming around) came by and asked about our drink order and said he will make sure it comes out expeditiously, but that didn't happen either.  The hostess kept asking if we were ready to go in, and the response was no, we would like to enjoy a couple cocktails before dinner, but were waiting patiently for them.  You'd think for how much you pay at this establishment that this would be a reasonable request....goodness, a patron wants to spend money on drinks!  We finally succumbed to the hostess when she said that her manager requested we take our table inside now.  Key to note here is that we did not want to sit outside on the patio, which was more in demand with the nice weather and live entertainment of a singer.  No, we specifically requested inside, as the ambience is very pleasant.  This encounter set the tone for the rest of the dinner, a folly if you will.  Once we got to our table inside, it was not a full.  I found this interesting since there was such a \"hurry\" for us to get to our table.  Our drinks arrived at the table, however my husband did not enjoy his, and no one asked how we liked them.  What did happen is the waiter saw we had full drinks and started to pressure us into getting down to business by selecting wine and dinner.  Now remind you, this is supposed to be a higher end restaurant that supposedly prides itself on service. I made a comment to the waiter that we are not in a rush and would like to enjoy our cocktails first and get settled into our evening, the menus, and wine selection.  Again, you'd think that this was a simple request, but not so.  The waiter came to the table again, slightly rushed in demeanor, asking if we were ready.  The response was no, and we are not in a hurry.  He said that's fine, as he has numerous other tables outside to handle.  Wow, such an odd response.  So not only is the bar short staffed, but now the wait staff, perhaps.    When we made it through our drinks, wine and dinner selections, we waited patiently for our waiter, as he traveled back and forth from the kitchen to the patio.  He did even stop by our table, our menus were closed, and asked if he could take one of the empty cocktail glasses away, but never asked if we were ready to order!  So odd and inefficient!  We watched the other waiter tend to his tables with more interest and desire to please.  We finally caught the waiter's eye and ordered.  The pinnacle dinner folly was when the food arrived.  They brought out the wrong meal for my husband.  We immediately advised the person delivering our meal (which was not our waiter) that he ordered something else.  The response by the deliverer was along the lines more negotiating if we would settle with what he brought, or would we rather wait for the correct dinner.  My husband responded with he'd like what he ordered.  Of course the waiter and one of the floating managers were notified, and the manager came over to apologize, and the waiter apologized and said something about his scribbled handwriting on the order.  So they took both plates back.  I ordered salmon, so now either my salmon was going to be cold, or slightly over cooked under a warmer while they corrected my husbands.  Most high end places would bring out completely fresh entrees for the patrons (at least that is my experience), but not the case.  I got the same dish back and my husband got his seabass.  Interestingly, when it was delivered, fairly quickly, the response was along the lines that someone else will  be waiting a bit longer for their dinner.  The portions were minuscule, especially the seabass.  It was not a good plate.  My salmon was just ok.  Honestly, the best highlight of the culinary creations were the little hushpuppy type rolls.  We never got an explanation of what the breads were, just plopped down the bread tray and moved on.  We narrowed down our dining selections to either Lon's or Durant's, and wished we went to Durant's.  As others noted, Lon's is not what it used to be, food is unremarkable and forgetful, and the service needs significant polishing (see review for The Henry/Matthew the wonderful waiter).  Obviously the owners and management are looking to make as much as they can off the dinner crowd and packing folks in.  Go elsewhere for service and food.",

All four of us enjoyed our brunch entrees which were the huevos rancheros with chorizo on fry bread (x2), the pancakes and the steak frites.  Ryan, our server, gave us a wonderful tour of the restaurant making sure to point out the original building and artwork and even got us the key to go downstairs to the wine cellar.  Did you know you can eat down there during the summer with a well priced prix-fixe menu?  Because it was a bit overcast, we were able to walk the property and enjoy a \"quick\" game of life size chess.  Overall, a fabulous experience which will bring us back!",

The food, with one notable exception, was excellent. The management's decision-making, when it mattered, was regrettable. All was perfect until the entrees arrived. I had asked the waiter whether he'd recommend the short ribs ($34) or the filet mignon ($42). He suggested the former. It is almost impossible for short ribs to be tough and dry. But they were. It is all but unheard of for short ribs to be tasteless. But they were. The manager offered to fetch me a filet. I agreed, though I grumbled that it would arrive well after my companions had finished. Which it did. The filet was quite good. But as I ate and my companions watched, the waiter whisked away one of their wine glasses even though there was wine left in the very nice bottle of Tempranillo. When I was finished, we had no intention of ordering dessert. But the waiter announced that the manager would give us a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. Then came the bill. They actually charged $42 for the filet, which replaced the inedible $34 short ribs. It's not the $8 I mind, really. It's the shortsightedness of that decision. Even at Lon's, repeat business = success. If I were the manager, I would have comped the entree because the three of us didn't really get to share a meal  because, on a Monday night, the kitchen was not at its best. Not my fault. But I paid for it.",

Walking into the patio area you're greeted by a beautiful fountain. (I had to stop for a photo, how could you not?) The outdoor patio is well lit for evening fun. No matter which way you look there is just something darling to admire. Architectural touches really have been thought out.   Indoors is adorable as well.

The limited menu, watered down, overly iced white sangria,  and forgetful waitress (or chef- not sure which) are the only reasons I'm giving this establishment four stars instead of five.   It was otherwise very good.  I ordered the superfood salad with kale, pomegranate seeds, sweet potato, pistachio nuts, quinoa, and dried cranberries. I asked for sauteed salmon on the salad but out it came with no salmon unfortunately.   I was too hungry to send it back, so I ate it as is. It was excellent! So good in fact that I'm going to try and replicate this magic at home in my own kitchen!  I won't forget the salmon though. ;-)  The waitress did give me a free \"birthday\" dessert (despite the fact that it wasn't my birthday) to make up for the forgotten salmon, so that was nice. It was some sort of brownie entree. Not my fave, but it tasted pretty good.  I just wish they offered a few more non-meat centric items on the brunch menu for those of us who don't eat land animals.  Would definitely try for another meal here though- perhaps dinner. The hotel and grounds are absolutely lovely and the live music was a nice touch. Classy joint!",

During the spring and fall, the Patio is a hot reservation. And I mean...call a few days in advance hot.   I enjoy Sunday evenings at Lon's. Typically, they offer a price fixe menu and have different delicious meats (whole pig anyone?) roasting on a spit.   Saturday evenings offer a live band, and is great for evening dining.   If the patio is crowded and we don't have a reservation, we are happy to dine at the bar.   I always recommend Lon's to out of town guests. Tasteful, charming, a former artists residence, it gives a great taste of the Southwest in a well-appointed setting.  About the food? My favorites on the menu? Jidori Chicken (and I don't usually order chicken...BUT...this chicken is Amazing!); truffle macaroni and cheese, any of their fish selections. And the dessert: The Cowboy candy bar.

This is the worst restaurant meal I have ever had. There were twelve in our group and ten of the twelve meals were unacceptable. Not only were the entrees horrible the appetizers and desserts were equally bad. The food was bland and flavorless. For example my entree was served with truffle gnocchi. This should be full of flavor. The $49.00 steak was loaded with fat and cooked wrong. One of them was sent back, the other only partially eaten. Oh, and don't be fooled by the tuna on the lava rock...flavorless. When this was pointed out to the server and a manager they did not know how to handle the situation. I, as well as the concierge, contacted the food and beverage manager, Dave. He couldn't have been more rude. Said he would contact me and never did. Also, according to the concierge, he said he would contact her as well...never did. There are way too many good restaurants in this area to waste your money at Lon's and they don't appreciate your business. I would go to The Mission, Elements or Pizzaria Bianco over Lon's. AVOID  this restaurant at all cost!!!",

We had the yellow tomato soup and best part was the grilled cheese piece of heaven. I could have had a whole meal of that goodness. The bread was light and crispy and the cheese was melt in your mouth (I believe) goat cheese.  The food was promptly served and we enjoyed every bite. We had to have the dessert, which included tastes of tiramisu, creme brulee and chocolate napolean. I ranked the creme brulee #1, tiramisu #2, my husband gave the number 1 to the tiramisu.

    "text": "I had almost the same bad experience as another reviewer.  This used to be a good restaurant but I think it is resting on its past glory.  The atmosphere is still great.  The surrounding is beautiful.  However, the food has gone downhill.   My girlfriend and I went there to celebrate her birthday.  We ordered the calamari appetizer.  It tasted nothing like calamari.  It was more like some kind of fish and it was soft, just like fish.  The sea bass I ordered was very average.  They throw in a few sticks of something to make it look presentable.  But, for $30 an entree' I expected something better. Since this is my girlfriend's birthday, I thought they would be decent enough to bring a small piece of cake or dessert to help her celebrate.  Guess what?  The waiter has the gall to bring 2 teeny pieces of chocolate with a candle on the plate.  I almost wanted to throw it back at him.  This is an insult, after spending more than $100 on the bill, all they can give you is 2 tiny pieces of chocolate?  Even Denny's will give you a free breakfast on your birthday.  It shows that this restaurant has no class. Save your money and go to any of the new restaurants with an up and coming chef.  Some place where they really want your business.",

Everyone was served their entree and I had nothing to eat with!  When I tried to catch the attention of my server, he ignored me!  Finally told everyone to start without me.  I finally snagged a passing busboy to accomodate me.  My last visit, I ordered the barrata cheese salad which I've had here before and was luscious.  This time the cheese was the consistency of a glob of paint on a paint lid.  Chewy and hard.  I sent it back and they microwaved the cheese to make it gooey!!  Awful mess.  I have always recommended this place for its ambience and food.  The latter and the service are amiss.  Will have to be convinced that they have improved greatly before I return!",

The best risotto I've ever had was at Lon's.  It was a kalamata risotto and it was awesome. They also have a really good sweet potato risotto. The food is southwestern and I was told that Lon's is Arizona's last remaining authentic hacienda.  That's pretty cool.    Not a place for small kids, but if you hit up Lon's with someone you actually like (don't make the same mistake I did), you'll have a great time.",

The service (again, for the price) was bush league.  Our server, although he tried, was unorthodox, unpolished and generally a little nervous.  I expected more from a place like this.    Hope this helps you make your decision.  I think we got stuck with a lame waiter.",

    "text": "We'e been to Lon's several times. Each time is a wonderful experience. This time was exceptional because we had a bit of a special request. We have been converting over to a more vegan diet and try to eat that way most of the time. My honey made a reservation for the Tuesday Trust Table which is where you trust the chef to create a five course menu for you while the sommelier pairs them with wines.   We were lucky enough to get the entire wine cellar to ourselves. The chef did accommodate our vegan request which a lot of places find annoying and many won't even do it. So this was awesome. The cellar was gorgeous and nice and cool in the desert heat.   The courses for the Tuesday Trust Dinner are served by the executive chef Jeremy Pacheco. Because it was a slow night, he actually spent a little time to talk foodie stuff with me. Yep, I was in heaven!  Each course was creative, fresh, colorful and delicious. The sommelier did an outstanding job with the parings. Our server was top notch.   I have a more complete review of the evening with pictures on my blog. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegintraing.blogspot.com&s=992f6b0719e3e72e34818c35bbf6289ea0160fd6d2572d882a71f8b667408a45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegintraing.blogspot.com</a>  The pictures and the descriptions don't do it justice. I agree with one of the other reviews that when the weather is right, you should absolutely sit out on the patio. It is gorgeous.   Outstanding service, food, and ambiance. Go!",

Acted like they were doing us a big favor by letting us eat there.   Wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced. We selected a good bottle (90 points WS) and when we asked the self-labeled \"wine guy\" about it, he said, \"I actually can drink that.\" A snobby comment.   Food was completely uninspired and pedestrian. Nothing special here.   Service fair, pace was bad between courses - long waits.   Had a meal the night before at T Cooks -it was extremely better in every single category. Lon's gets by on it's nice patio setting. The food is average at best. Go to T Cooks instead.  If you do go here, call long ahead and at least get a decent table on the patio.",

My wife and I tried the grilled shrimp and octopus cocktail which tasted like it had been frozen (and no evidence of any of it being grilled) and the flavor was just ehh, and the proscuitto wrapped veal entree was just as uninspiring. Well cooked but borrring. The fact that you pay $35 for an entree and may need to add additional sides is a bit unnerving as well. Good, attentive service but if you are a foodie, I would try elsewhere.",

There are 3 big men in my family and they stuck us in some corner table that was hard for them to get in and out of. Our waiter was a man named \"Brian\" who was pretty sharp and rude. By the time we got there, it was late, we had a 9pm reservation so perhaps he had a long night. But my mother asked him to repeat something and he yelled \"would you like some water?\" It was pretty annoying because my mother is not hard of hearing or anything, she just didn't understand what he was asking. The food was mediocre. Anyway our friends had recommended this restaurant so highly that we were pretty disappointed. The waiter got a little nicer by the end of the dinner, but he had started out so bad, that we weren't impressed. Normally I would chalk this up to perhaps just the waiter having a bad day, but it just really isn't the most welcoming establishment. The restaurant does have a lot of ambiance and the outside area looked fantastic, but service plays a big part in where I would like to eat.",

Each plate was 3 stacks so they had plenty to share. We started with the monkey bread which was unreal. I highly recommend. We also shared the avocado toast which was good. I had the wagyu burger, very good. My wife had chicken club, and I had a couple bites of that as well. Also very good. Finally, can't forget the chipotle bloody that really hit the spot.

We shared the marinated goat cheese curds, the fire roasted olives and the raw & pickled seasonal veggies as an appetizers, I had the ribs as a main and the signature candy bar (which was generously gifted on the house!) for dessert. Everything was so delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner or celebration. We'll be back.",

When we sat down at our table everything was fine and then it took a turn for the worst.  A few minutes into the dining experience management decides to seat a group of old obnoxious/loud women at a large table next to where we were seated.  The couples that were seated around us seemed annoyed by this as well.  Our waiter was decent in the beginning of the meal and then it was almost like he forgot about us and never asked us how our main entree was tasting.  I do have to say the bus staff were on top of their game by making sure the table was clear when you were done and making sure your water was full.  Also,  I thought the meal itself was flavorful and fresh.   We all took advantage of the restaurant week menu which was a good deal for right amount of food.  So, overall the food was good and the bus staff was excellent but the service and management is something to be desired especially since we were celebrating a special occasion.

    "text": "I have fond memories of the Hermosa Inn back in the late '90's before the bubble burst. My company at the time used to let me stay here in one of the charming adobe casitas with the romantic fireplace. Now granted I was alone and without, ahem, equipment, but still it was a lovely spot. Now nearly twenty years later, I was given the task of finding a dining spot for a couple of colleagues and myself on a Monday evening. Now as you know, most fine restaurants are closed on Mondays, so for some reason, I flashed back on the Hermosa and then I recalled a restaurant scene with Whitney Houston in \"Waiting to Exhale\".  Shoop, shoop...anyway, that's how I found Lon's...seriously. As we were awaiting our third colleague, we strolled around the adobe-laden grounds which still had that southwestern allure I recall. As we entered the small bar and then the dining room, we noticed the decor was upscale cowboy ranch which I couldn't make up my mind was retro-chic or just faded old-school (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2f4fwXI&s=2ada0bb926f99528f91413241c5e350c032f8db940e177782d46a8a236b0e37d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2f4fwXI</a>). No matter as It turned out to be Arizona Restaurant Week, so we each took advantage of the three-course dinner available for $44 (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2eZzFzE&s=4056169786b77e5d9a6a12702816c2c8388fe00a78917191b8b79f35a0c92486\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2eZzFzE</a>).  It started with a cutting board full of bread of which I took extreme liberties with the tasty mini-cornbread muffins (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2eQv4ig&s=168a49a54240c2303663c1a5cc93f3aaf5b0b02b6966b6cf9f369485fe2c5be6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2eQv4ig</a>). My first course was the Crab-Stuffed Squash Blossoms in which the crab was mixed liberally with an aji Amarillo aioli. It was accompanied by bits of avocado, grape tomato halves and spicy sprouts (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2frXa7j&s=3ca0ac2e441c722e371cb29ef3d3d8c90cc71c5b8fd84df2b567c470d7dfa1f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2frXa7j</a>). Good though rather tiny in portion for even an appetizer. My entree was the hefty Dry-Aged Heritage Pork Chop served with a hash made of yams, corn, hatch chiles and a swoosh of mole (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2dRVfse&s=295a37ce0a057ac590f9ff0bd6babf2afba58d4d974b26ab103733ff36a75b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2dRVfse</a>).  While the pork was tender and succulent, the hash was somewhat disappointing since it tasted rather dry considering the interesting mix of flavors. We did on a satisfying sweet note sharing a trio of desserts - the Chocolate Caramel Tart with Salted Caramel Gelato (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2f1fEIw&s=2c980d5c690893e12244629480084ce817e206c5f9d8c5e122937af2468120d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2f1fEIw</a>), Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Mango Curd and Coconut Sorbet (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2dZiRGj&s=48e3cc2cf420436076f244b53756263604bb874f21abf456ee294a158c79aebe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2dZiRGj</a>); and Lon's Signature Cowboy Candy Bar with chili-spiced ganache and hazelnuts (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2emUuTW&s=28bbb871c4d9c9d2fac40705670d90010511b56f02084ea9b606b46dc5ec2157\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2emUuTW</a>). Bites of these confections allowed the meal to end on a high note even if I'm not a fan of cowhide chairs.  FOOD - 3 stars...presentations are nice but quality is variable hovering around hotel banquet level AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...the grounds are lovely, but the interior feels kinda dated with its traditional southwest decor SERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive if a bit unctuous TOTAL - 3 stars...shoop, shoop",

Yes, the interior of the restaurant is a little kitschy, but the food and service are first rate.  If you arrive early, you'll wait at the little bar off to the side.  The servers at the bar are attentive and quick.  When you're seated in the main dining room, the servers are once again attentive and very gracious.  The menu changes with the seasons and they try to emphasize locally sourced ingredients.  The portions aren't huge and the flavoring is very delicate.  Also the presentation of some of the food is surprisingly detailed.  Their 2018 Fall menu features a Spanish octopus carpaccio.  The octopus was so tender and sliced so thin!  It was delicious. I had their black cod as my entree and it was also lightly flavored and delicious.  Their deserts are once again small and delicate.  The table shared 2 desserts, a date-pecan cake and a pumpkin spice cheesecake.  Light, airy, almost makes you believe you're not eating dessert.  It's a wonderful restaurant, and I highly recommend it to discerning diners.",

The gardens, patios and views are perfect Arizona, giving the feel of old-Phoenix getaways!  From the moment the valet takes our car we start to feel like we are someplace special.  A very friendly welcome and greeting from the hostess, and we are led to our table where everything from the appetizers to the wine and entrees was amazing.  Our waiter, Troy, did a great job at both casually suggesting and educating menu items, and taking care of us throughout our dinner.  The tuna appetizer searing on the block of salt was amazing, along with the filet and braised short ribs!  At the end of our dinner, there was no urgency to rush out, we enjoyed the last of our wine followed by a stroll through the patio back to our car.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Lon's.",

Once seated took another 30 for first course. Then another 30 mins to get a cold steak. Instead firing a new steak they simply put mine back on and fired it until burnt.  Could even eat it. By then it was 1030p.  Biggest issue was no manager to apologize. Will never be back.",

As a vegetarian, I chose the mushroom risotto. This dish was inedible due to the intense saltiness. Thankfully, the bread was superb. Waiter forgot the wine...twice. Desserts were uninspired. Overall, a disappointing experience. Normally, I would chalk it up to a one time miss, however, this is the third time I've had a poor experience within the last year. After enjoying this restaurant for 10+ years, I don't see a return in the future",

    "text": "We had brunch at Lon's today for my parents anniversary. It was a really nice experience. Unfortunately, we were unable to sit on the famed patio because it was rainy, but we loved the Southwestern motif of the dining rooms, complete with the kiva fireplaces. The art on the walls, is obviously, fabulous.   We started with the *Monkey Bread*. It was delicious. Absolutely yummy! Very sugary- it was actually swimming in syrup and frosting, and then covered with pecans. How decadent. I actually ate a 3rd of the dish, and was almost completely full. I didn't leave myself enough room for the *Chopped Salad* full of fresh vegetables. I got it without the turkey and cheese, but I'm assuming if you like that kind of thing, it would add something to the dish. They were very good about subbing a hardboiled egg for the turkey. It was dressed lightly with a cilantro vinaigrette, and had the crunch of pumpkin seeds throughout. I was really surprised with how generous the portion was. Lon's isn't about charging a good amount for a little bit of food, they pile it on!  My parents both got the *Lemon Ricotta Pancakes*. They weren't anything like the pancakes you are used to. They are circular and tall, but not in the least bit dense. The compote served along with them was the perfect compliment to the lemon of the lemony whipped cream and pancake. They probably could have spit an order, as they both had leftovers!  My husband got the *Lon's Club*. He complimented the bread, being a little harder on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It was piled high with chicken breast, ham, cheese, avocado and aoili. It came with a side of either salad or french fries and their famous apple slaw. He chose the french fries, which I was very happy about because they were perfectly cooked, and really well seasoned... I stole more than a few. He said the apple slaw was refreshing. It had raisins in it as well.   We can't wait to go back to Lon's. The cost of the brunch was very reasonable. $74 without tax or tip. 4 entrees, and a starter, coffee and tea.",

We weren't dressed for the class of this restaurant, but we were welcomed without judgement. We began with a cocktail in the bar. Stetson decorated, hipster Libationists, interesting concoctions of infused liquors set the tone for a memorable experience! Once seated in the restaurant, we were greeted by a professional waiter (which I love). We began with the tuna appetizer which you sear right at your table. For starter I had the fig and pecan salad...amazing! Our group chose a variety of entres including salmon, pork and short ribs. All served beautifully and tasted divine! Although we were stuffed we had to try their deconstructed snickers bar for desert.........LOVED IT! Do not pass on desert here! At the end of our evening the Valet had already brought our car around as he heard us talking in the courtyard so when we walked it out it was waiting!

The outside patio seating area is beautiful, with flowers, soft lights, and couches to relax in. The live entertainment that night was perfect for us baby boomers. We benefitted from happy hour pricing and enjoyed a variety of appetizers, all of which were tasty. Our waitress was terrific -- very patient with us as we jockeyed our way to a preferred seating area -- and she chatted with us just enough to be friendly without being obtrusive. Being outside on a spring evening as twilight descended was magical. (Well, maybe with the exception of the ill-mannered bird perched in a tree over our seating area!)",

They were made with virtually no - or no- filler at all.  They were perfectly done and excellent.  I had the steak frites.  The fries were very good, the greens were beautifully dressed in a very lemony dressing, and the steak was one of the most flavorful I have ever had.  The chimichurri seasonings were perfect and the chef prepared it a perfectly medium-rare, just as I ordered it.  Service was spectacular - so friendly and so professional.  We were so impressed that we cancelled a dinner reservation we had for this coming Friday just so we could go back to Lon's.  As an aside, there were two children at a table next to us outside, and there is almost nothing on the brunch menu for kids.  The server told the two that he could do anything they wanted, even plain pancakes with syrup on the side.  I don't know what they eventually ordered, but I impressed that they offered to do \"anything\" for the children.  The atmosphere on the patio was wonderful, as was the live guitar music.  In all, one of the most memorable brunches we have ever had.",

Each time, the staff catered to our needs perfectly. It is upscale without being snooty. It's expensive but feels like a good value. I can't recommend it strongly enough. The only catch is that you need to request the patio when you make your reservation. Otherwise, you may get stuck inside. Inside is like a different restaurant. The food and service are still good, but the few times we've dined inside, we've found it to be a step down from what we've received on the patio. And the atmosphere inside is dark and dated. So, just request outside, and you're good to go.",

We went late, 9pm rez, It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace. You seriously have to sit outside, it's almost like you're in another state on vacation with how secluded it is. Each table gets its own heat lamp too, by the way. We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool. Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude. We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing. The mussels were delicious.. I LOVE mussels, and ever since I left Boston, I haven't had any good ones.. these were awesome. I wanted more. The Foie Gras was obviously delicious..  Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds.   For our entrees, I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin. For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus. I'm not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates. We devoured everything, and all of it was perfect. Especially the bottle of wine we split with it.  To wrap up the meal, we got the creme brulee to share, and as my photo shows, they personalized it for my special day. That along with 2 glasses of port, and we were good to go..   Staff don't mess around, they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet.   I will say this place is not cheap, and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions, however, I will absolutely go back again and again and again, birthday or not. Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had, period.",

    "text": "We were recently subjected to the enormous disappointment and displeasure of having brunch at Lon's, this despite the beautiful, enchanting setting.   In short, both the service and food were abyssmal.   Although we had a reservatioin, upon arrival our reception was far from cordial and/or welcoming.  It was as if we were somehow unexpected and/or an annoyance.  Once we were seated in the garden, we waited a very long time until our waiter, looking quite dishelveled, finally arrived.   Although he was cordial, he seemed rather uncertain and had some difficulty understanding our order; in fact he returned to the table twice to review what we had ordered.  He subsequently proved to be quite inept in the most rudimentary tasks, as well, reaching across the table in front of one guest to place something before another guest (twice), touching clean silverware at the tines and blades rather than the handle, and disappearing for long stretches of time until we went looking for him (twice).       We ordered drinks and water first.  The drinks arrived after a considerable wait, but no water accompanied them.  Finally, after mentioning the water to our waiter three times, and then to other employees twice, we finally received a bottle of water which was not adequate for the four of us.  When the food arrived, with the exception of the kale salad, it proved to be very disappointing.  My husband ordered huevos rancheros, but what he received hardly conformed to the traditional Mexican dish, which generally consists of scrambled eggs liberally laced with chorizo and salsa.  What he received was a piece of something called \"fry bread\" (a kind of limp, tortilla-like concoction) covered with a very modest layer of refried beans mixed with a bit of tasteless ground meat that had absolutely no resemblance to chorizo;this was topped with a single fried egg.  I ordered the short rib hash, which was no better.  It was dry and tasteless, and the poached eggs were also tasteless and too well done.  A single piece of cold toast with the tiniest amount of butter accompanied the dish.  Although I did enjoy my salad, I had expected and certainly would have appreciated some bread or crackers;however, we received none.  In both our cases, and that of our friends' entrees, we were surprised at the very meager portions.        Although we have lived in Scottsdale for many years, we travel extensively, both for business and pleasure, in the U.S. as well as in various European countries, often spending 3-4 months per year away from home.  Hence, we have experienced a wide variety of cuisines in any number of restaurants at various price points, and based on our experience, we believe we are absolutely justified in judging the food and service at Lon's to be absolutely sub-standard.  It's a pity that in this truly unique and inspiring setting, no one seems to know  enough, or perhaps to care enough about the essential purpose of the place.",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour last Wed. so this review is for the bar only.  We got the 3 tapas for $15 deal.  The food was fantastic but very small portions so we did end up ordering chips with salsa and guacamole on top of it.  The tapas trio was served on a wrought iron \"tree\" which makes for a beautiful presentation.  But you can see from the pics that it really only feeds one person unless you are planning to have dinner afterwards.  All the food was delicious but at the end of the night we spent almost $60 for two and still left hungry.  Of course, that was really my fault since I am a sucker for those high-priced specialty cocktails. Those went down a little too easy at $12-$14 a pop. I highly recommend the one with grapefruit and basil.  It was truly amazing.  Very tasty and fresh but not too sweet.  I also tried the one made with gin and chambord which I did not like as much as I thought would but it was made by the other bartender and I think that had something to do with it.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch either of their names so I am no help there.  But when you go, look for a woman at the bar with the long, sandy blond pony tail 'cause she rocks!  I probably should have just stuck to beer like my husband since those were only $4. Which is not bad considering they had a great selection, though unfortunately everything was bottled, no taps.  They had the usual higher end stuff like Stella, Guinness, and New Belgium. Plus some awesome local beers like Four Peaks (Kiltlifter and 8th St ale), San Tan (Epicenter and hefeweizen) and Nimbus (ipa).  Of course the setting was lovely since the bar is adjacent to Lon's and connected to their famous patio.  I just love the decor here.  Upscale rustic southwest, beautifully done.  It was too hot to sit outside but we did stroll around the grounds of the Hermosa Inn a bit and everything looked gorgeous.  We will definitely be back for dinner the next time we have a special occasion to celebrate.",

    "text": "I've been here several times over the years on my various trips to Phoenix and never been disappointed. I recently spent a night at the Hermosa Inn where Lon's is located, so I actually ate three meals here and found the quality high again. The dining room is in what used to be cowboy artist Lon Megargee's house, so seating is in a couple of different rooms. There's also a patio dining area out front with a beautiful fountain, but it's typically not open in the summer and that's always when I come, so I've never been able to try that.   Service is always great, with lots of folks who have been working here for a long time. The menu has about 8 selections each for appetizer and main course. At dinner, I had the Arizona salad, which was greens with bleu cheese, pecans, mixed berries and a berry vinaigrette. Nice. My main course was one of the best things I've had lately--a roasted halibut with a mushroom broth, crispy snow peas for textural contrast, and a picked English cucumber salad to balance the salt of the fish. It was truly sensational. I'm not really that big on dessert (carbs are my weakness), but I tried their housemade sorbets, which included raspberry and blackberry-apple. They came with white-and-milk-chocolate straws. Very nice. The wine list surpasses extensive and borders on the ridiculous, but I found it to be very reasonably priced. There are over a dozen bottles in the $35-$40 range, then of course they go way up from there.   My only complaint would be that I've noticed over the years there is a lack of unusual dishes. They have creative and well-executed preparations of the standard fish, chicken, meat stuff, but I'd love to see some more adventurous game and fowl selections. I'd be very interested to see what the chef could do with things like bison, quail, elk, boar, etc. The menu changes frequently, but I have noticed that there seems to be a standard rotation of base ingredients.",

    "text": "On a crisp fall evening in Phoenix (which means 60 degrees) you can smell the wood fires burning on the expansive patio as the valet takes your keys.  This was a dinner for 4 and a birthday celebration for a 12 year old. Right away, the staff made our birthday guest feel special with her preference of seating (table 4- indoors with sunset views) and a birthday card from the restaurant. Our server, I think her name was Dolores, spoke with a French accent, which made the birthday experience even fatter for a 12 year old girl who had never climbed past Olive Garden fancy up til tonight. Dolores(?) answered all the questions the 2 younger guests had, such as what's Jidori mean? What is foie gras? And is pork belly really just bacon?  We started off the meal with the complimentary bread basket (chile corn bread, and the most awesome ancho flatbread) and some calamari. Calamari is supposed to be tender and not rubbery and this was perfectly cooked.  The menu changes seasonally at Lon's and we all decided that we were going to go for something hearty, so it was sea bass, pork duo and the Jidori chicken. Our server said the chicken was a half-bird, so two of us split that entree (which the staff accomplished at our table without a sidewards glance) and because the goat cheese mac n cheese is a requirement here, we ordered a side of that.   With 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer and 3 entrees, I spent $165 including the tip.  The patrons at Lon's are mostly an older crowd, but it's a classy place with really delicious food and great service and a rustic atmosphere. Perfect spot for a special occasion in Paradise Valley.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited Lon's for Valentines Dinner.  I had been there before (and loved it), but I wanted her to experience the Lon's touch.    In my opinion, Lon's probably has one of the best ambiance in the business (especially at night).  It's all valet parking (don't forget cash).  The dress is resort casual (i wore jeans and a button up dress shirt).  As you walk up the patio is lit up by cool lighting, raging chimineas, and cool jazz being played by the live band.    We arrived a little early and were persuaded by one of the managers to grab a few drinks from the bar (the mojitos were great - the mint is freshly picked from their garden and when mixed it is strained so you don't suck up a mint leaf in your straw)   and join him on a tour of the place.  Every room at this restaurant is unique and different.  The wine cellar downstairs is like nothing I've ever seen.  Hundreds of selections of wines, amazing stone ceiling/floors/walls etc..  The place actually cures it's own ham in a small room downstairs next to the cellar.    After the tour we were seated and our Waiter for the evening was Ben.  He was a True delight.  He was a hip younger guy that was very professional and had a great sense of humor.  He was very helpful in tailoring the menu to our preferences.  I ordered a fish plate with dungeness crab, salmon, shrimp, with a red wine sauce on a toasted piece of french bread.  Having lived in the NW for years, I can honestly say the fish/crab was extremely fresh and cooked to perfection.  My wife had the short ribs and they too were wonderful.  We both had the strawberry mousse as a dessert and they were great as well.  Very rich, but the small size made it a dessert I could conquer.  The 3 course meal was proportioned perfectly and there wasn't that urge to take a power nap before you tackled the drive home.    Great service, food quality, and ambiance definitely worth the $$$$.  We'll be back!",

A premium restaurant.  Lovely service and delicious food. My beet salad ...great. Salmon done perfectly.   Asked for it done  less than medium.  Bread was crunchy and delicious with herbed butter.  LONS IS EXPENSIVE..............But, worth it for your special date",

The second best thing was sitting on the patio under the stars, listening to the cowboy music. The food was good, not great, with the salads being the best part. It's a little heavy on the sauces. Service was medium-attentive; the bus boys were great. The bread basket was also really good.",

My favorite thing to do is eat outside on the patio, when the weather is good for that...but the inside is lovely as well.. Upscale, yet you see people in shorts and jeans as well...so it is not a stuffy place at all.  The food is served beautifully and there is a good variety.  I would like to see more vegetarian items, but that is my only complaint.  You will never be disappointed here.  I have attended cooking classes here, as well as a wedding and the property is just lovely, the flowers are beautiful and the rooms on the grounds are delightfully appointed as well.",

We've had the same server who is the nicest gal and always on top of her game! although I have yet to come for dinner or brunch, the happy hour has a great menu to choose from and you're able to share with friends. Cheeseboard and a carafe of wine for $28, you can't beat that. The outdoor seating during the nice weather season is a must. Quiet, outdoor area with fire places. Inside they have a bar area along with big sista seating. The atmosphere is very laid back and quiet, where you can enjoy the camelback mountains while drinking a great wine!",

I have had wonderful lunches here, however, this was my first time for dinner  We were first greeted by Amy, a lovely and very friendly, hostess. She showed us to a great table. Now, it was a beautiful night and after 7 o'clock we were able to eat on the patio. The ambience couldn't have been more stunning with the candle light, twinkling stars and listening to Frank Sinatra in the background. No loud music here......it's peaceful, and one could actually hear conversation.  We all chose the 3 course dinner from Lon's tasting menu. We each had different appetizers which were very inventive and so delicious. Two of us had the halibut and 1 had  the pork shank. We chose two sides; parmesan truffled fries, with a dipping sauce that i could eat with every thing, ( I could get addicted to these, they were soooo delicious) and perfectly cooked broccolini. The halibut was moist and also perfectly cooked.  My friend loved the pork Shan as well.   We finished with peaches in a puffed pastry with vanilla creme fraiche, YUM! Canteen was our wonderful, attentive and very knowledgeable server.  A delightful evening was had and we plan to return soon.",

We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday.   We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.    Overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal.",

The \"last drop\" cocktail was a great spin on an old fashioned and my raspberry lemon drop was to die for!!  Our server, Brandon, was awesome. He recommended great options on the menu and was very nice.  The person who really impressed me was Tracy, who would occasionally come fill our waters and grab our empty plates off the table. For such small gestures, he was so kind and respectful, and truly upheld the values that a restaurant like this should have. He was absolutely wonderful! I didn't have a chance to talk to the manager to tell him how great he was, so I hope he reads this or sees it once it's posted. Thank you Lon's for making our Valentine's Day so special!",

The food descriptions definitely caught me off guard as I didn't know what lost any of it meant! Lol I saw chicken and ordered what I thought I knew. Normally when I see chicken, I don't think of anymore than chicken off of the grill. But this meat was super tender and juicy however it was prepared! Everything was just really really good. If you like Brussel sprouts and want to try a different way of them being prepared then order a side of them for the table. They're deconstructed like and have an amazingly unique taste to them! I'm not used to the exceptional type of service offered here but it was a treat. The desserts are so good too. If you love chocolate and caramel and toffee then order the candy bar. It's literally a different taste in every bite. All in all this is definitely a place to try if you are in paradise valley and are looking to basically be pampered.",

The space heaters kept it warm in the February air and the lighting at night was really lovely.  They made the perfect tequila gimlet for me, and my guests loved their drinks.  I would try the mule on tap; that was a table favorite.   Appetizers were delish.  We had the fritto misto, the beet salad, and the peppers.  They were all eaten!  For sides, the truffle fries and Brussels sprouts are a must do.  For 8 of us, we pretty much tried everything on the menu. They made me a gluten free meal that was amazing (short ribs).  Absolutely no complaints.  We also ordered a few desserts and passed around the table.  I would definitely do the smores bar.  Delish!  Excellent service as well.

We were probably the youngest table there and all I could think about was OKAY I'M COMING TO EAT HERE AGAIN WHEN I'M RETIRED AND HAVE A LOT MORE TIME (if not earlier).   We took a walk around the Inn and it was fabulous - flowers everywhere and you can tell that folks put time and care into maintaining it (well duh, since a night is like $350+). This place is just too cute - I encourage everyone to spend time walking around inside and out!  On to the food!! We ordered the fluffy lemon pancakes and eggs benedict standard style - didn't want to stuff ourselves since we were going hiking. Portions looked small when it came out but it was surprisingly filling. Pancakes were souffle style - light, fluffy, with a cake-like texture.. yum. Eggs benedict was a nice salty balance to complement the pancakes.. delicious as well. Our waiter was very friendly and took good care of us - A+ there.  4 stars since I didn't get to try everything I'd like to (but definitely loved everything I DID get to try) and didn't order any drinks this time around. Will be coming back though!",

    "text": "Spent the last morning of our trip to Phoenix having brunch at Lon's.    First off it is a beautiful outdoor garden setting.     We ordered the \"monkey bread\" to start.   So yummy, sweet and delicious, really did want to lick the bowl but this place is just a little too classy for that.  The kitchen did a wonderful job in tailoring the entree's to our food allergies so big thumbs up for that.  The breakfast pizza was wonderful but on the smaller side and the goat cheese was applied unevenly resulting in 2 slices with a large amount and 3 with almost none.    Taking a few extra seconds to even it out would have been a big help.  The breakfast hash was good not great but I'm not really a fan of short ribs so maybe that's a we ordered wrong not really the fault of the kitchen.     We did look at the meals served around us and all were really well presented and looked fantastic.     If your looking for a great place to \"check out\" of the city and relax for a wonderful brunch experience.  Lon's is your place",

My eggs benedict were over-cooked and served with just a swipe of hollandaise, thus VERY dry and tasteless. The others ordered the short rib hash, also over-cooked and dry.  We had to ask repeatedly for our coffee cups to be refilled. C'mon, this is brunch--at least leave us a carafe if you can't keep up! Service was dismal, almost as if they hadn't expected guests. You could get a much tastier meal at Ihop for a fraction of the price. That aside, it's a lovely  setting and the guitarist playing in the garden was a delightful touch.",

While there was a small glitch in the reservation time that was made with open-table and what the restaurant wrote down, they were able to seat us quickly and no delay was experienced.    My wife went with the Restaurant Week menu and the portions were all big enough to leave feeling full.  I went with the 10 oz fillet and steamed vegetables and was very impressed with the quality of the meat.  We will definitely come back to Lon's at The Hermosa and will be recommending it to family and friends.",

I ordered tomatoe and mozarella salad (which personally could have had some more greenery), and the salmon for the main course.  The asparagus and salmon was cooked to perfection a nice blend of flavors.  Definitely not a place to dine on a budget, but it is well worth the money.",

Here is my experience...I walked into the restaurant for dinner and there was no one in sight. The maitre dee asked my name for a reservation and i stated I was a walk in. He said...let me see what I have but you may be sitting in a room by yourself. He proceeded to say, \"let me see to these guests and then I'll try to seat you!\"  An older couple was still outside walking up that he felt where a priority over finding me and my guest a table. As I was standing in the doorway completely embarrassed in front if my guest and thinking about how demeaning the person was I walked out and decided not to eat here.   This place may have amazing food and amazing cocktails but I was not able to get past the service.  I will not be going back nor would I ever recommend someone subjecting themselves to that kind of treatment.",

The place wasn't busy at all, we decided to sit inside since it was really hot outside. Our server had 3 tables max. It took him forever to come by and occasionally check on us. The monkey bread was delicious but we ordered the Eggs Benedict, which were fine. But the side of potatoes were the bottom of the barrel, 3 day old sterile, hard potatoes. Not what I would imagine from a nice place like that. Also, I wasn't the only one with a child in diapers, I saw at least 2 other families with little ones. They didn't have a place to properly change her. I must say they were very accommodating but I'd recommend they invest in a changing station, I'm sure they get asked a lot. I would go back for a cocktail on a cooler evening the outside ambiance is very lovely.",

    "text": "Had the 2nd worst meal ever here, behind only Vincent's on Camelback (feel free to see my review of that place)  I wish I would have remembered the old chef left at the start of august  It started pretty poorly, then they started cooking which made things even worse  Walking in there was on one to greet us, we had to track down the hostess (not a big deal but a minor quibble, with the pricing they have that is something that should never happen)  They ran out of the tasting menu at 8PM on a Saturday on the holiday weekend, as well as they running out of pasta - we were informed after being seated, ordering drinks and a bottle of wine, and deciding on the tasting menu - so at least 15-20 minutes passed since sitting down with zero mention of them being out of anything, which should have been mentioned when we were presented with the menu's   All of the fish dishes (ciappino and halibut) were overcooked and dry, as were the Short Ribs (which is hard to do)  My tenderloin came out rare vs med rare (which is fine for me) but was overly salty to the point it was about inedible, and also had a piece of bacon on top of it - why would you ruin a good piece of meat with strip of bacon on top - made no sense, sent it back  The cocktails there were very poor, French 75 I think only looked at the gin bottle instead actually having any poured in and the whiskey smash which was on their \"special\" menu was terrible - if Travis is a good bartender or runs a good bar program this was certainly not evident, and they have a Mai Tai listed on the menu but don't even have orgeat listed as an ingredient so that was enough to steer me off of that one, but I am sure it would have been very orangey and come in a Collins glass with a slice of orange  The only bright spot which was small (literally undersized) was the foie gras, which was done very well and seared, with a light jam underneath the toast, and some peanut butter-ish spread on the side with some huckleberries - however the portion was about the size of a tasting menu portion not an appetizer portion - perhaps they were running out of foie gras as well, but I don't expect 3 bites out of a $16 app  Poor all the way around - Do not waste your money here",

Nothing I saw on website said that it was only brunch on Saturday afternoon.  Very limited menu!!   My chicken strawberry salad was terrible.  Chicken meant little pieces of dark meat.  Other ingredients were shredded.  It was bad. We shared desserts at the table and the cowboy dessert needed a chainsaw to cut and they did not give us a knife!!   Our water glasses were left empty.  Obviously it was embarrassing and disappointing. It is time to judge by food and service and not pretty flowers.",

    "text": "Sushi grade Ahi served on a 500 degree block of Himalayan sea salt. A lone short rib, cubed, perched atop a bed of braised root vegetables. So majestic looking, it reminded me of a sentinel on lookout. A hangar steak (flank) cooked to perfection.  All three shared two common themes: Both the presentation and sodium levels were immeasurable.  I love Lon's. I want to show them off to my friends from out of town.  I love their wine cellar...it's dungeon-esque type features. I want to eat there on special occasions because I know I won't be disappointed. But this trip had me rethinking everything I know about Lon's and that's saying something since I've been going there for many years now.  The gravy on the hangar steak was inedible it was so salty. My girls secretly wiped it all away so as not to create a stir with our server, knowing I would send it all back and give him a couple of what-fers in the process. My short rib was braised perfectly, however, it was dry and lean. Not what I was hoping for. And the pre-dinner bread basket had the most delicious looking chips, also inedible due to the extreme salt content.  Stay out of the bar. I ordered a Crown Royal Manhattan. I was informed they don't serve Crown Royal, but some bullshit well whiskey called Buffalo Trace. Seriously, who doesn't serve Crown? I expected Lon's to serve Crown Black for Christ's sakes. My wife ordered a Mai Tai. It was undrinkable.  Lon's, here's some advice from the cheap seats. Stop believing your own press clippings and take a long hard look in the mirror.  At the very least, hire an executive chef whose cravings for salt doesn't rival a 14th century sailor sporting a goiter the size of a basketball.",

We were forewarned that people had complained of mosquitoes outside so we immediately decided on inside seating. My sister and I are both mosquito magnets. The service was good yet we noticed how a server for another table gave a much more thorough explanation of the menu selections. Now back to what should have been the end of the mosquito issue. We were seated inside but found that there were mosquitos a plenty hovering around our table. We decided we'd keep an eye on them to help each other not get bitten. Those guys are sneaky though. Before we finished our wonderful meal (me the lamb duo, my sister the chicken), we both had been bitten 3 times. One of my sister's bites was on the bridge of her nose. One of my bites was on the ankle THROUGH MY THICK SOCK. They were ferocious. It kinda ruined the dining experience. Our waiter brought a citronella candle but the damage was already done. We wanted out of there before we sustained another bite. We mentioned it to the manager. He apologized. I felt the sincerity...I think???",

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely incredible.  We went recently for my grandmother's 95th birthday.  Usually, we go to Elements when we visit Arizona, but they have a new 48 hour cancellation policy that doesn't work great if you have diners over 90 years old (never know if someone may not feel up to a big dinner), so we decided to try somewhere new.  I am so glad that we did!  The food was unbelievable.  We started with the calamari (surprisingly light and not at all greasy) and the Hermosa Salad, which had no right to be as delicious as it was.  All of our entrees were also fabulous, though, to me, the standout was the pork chop.  I am a big pork lover and I have never had a better pork chop.  Ever.  The lamb was also delicious and the sauces were incredible.  The filet was also great, just wish that there was more gnocchi (I'm crazy about gnocchi and it's often not done as well as it is here).  For sides, we got the truffle mac and the corn, both of which were amazing.  I love the truffle mac, most times the truffle is kind of overpowering, but the flavor was great and the pasta was really really good.  A lot of times it just feels like places smother boxed pasta with cheese, but this pasta could have been homemade it had such great texture.  We got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert which, like the rest of the meal, was unreal.    The thing that made our family decide that we'd choose Lon's over anywhere else moving forward, though, was the incredible incredible service.  My family loves to eat out and we've had the opportunity to go to a lot of great places, but we all agreed that we'd never had better service.  It was, frankly, perfect.  Our server, Richard, was kind, helpful, and seemed to read our minds with what we might like and when we might have a question.  Every random request was met with incredible graciousness.  My grandma said afterwards that she felt so special.  Highly, highly recommend!  Only things to keep in mind: the menu on OpenTable isn't current, in their less busy season (aka middle of summer), the menu is a little smaller.  Also, the Hermosa is going through construction, so the view isn't quite as nice as it could be near the side.",

Therefore, it is important that we get out and continue to support them. The Shrimp and Crab Salad was awesome, and the Ruben Sandwich was decadent! The server presented her with a lovely plated dessert. Happy Birthday was written in chocolate. The staff signed a lovely birthday card.  She was so surprised. These are the touches that make Lon's a special place.",

I like the dessert southwest ambience.    enjoyed dinner here during restaurant week with Crab stuffed squash blossoms, heirloom & goat cheese for appetizers.   Main course: Halibut and pork chops for the husband.  Dessert:    They offer a 10 page book of wines to choose to pair with your dinner.    Walking the grounds after dinner was so nice.   Enjoy a bottle of wine and dine at this romantic restuarant and stay for the night and relax in this beautiful and enchanting Inn.    We will definitely back for another delicious meal, this time we'll bring the whole family.",

I particularly liked the mini cornbread. I had Bob's Squash Blossom with chorizo & cheddar stuffed, corn pudding, pickled peppers. This appetizer left me wanting more and the presentation was very artful. The main entree was Alaskan Halibut with snap peas and I'toi onion pesto and lemon vinaigrette. The Halibut was cooked just right and was moist and flavorful. I had a local dessert made with Schnepf's farms peaches, puff pastery, vanilla creme fraiche, honey gelato.  It was all very delicious.",

We don't usually sit outdoors at restaurants but the weather was just perfect and we went for it. It was lovely.  All the staff was very friendly and professional, and our server Scott was outstanding. He was very upbeat, awesome with drink refills, had great recommendations and, honestly, shared with us very clever remarks that made our evening fun and memorable. He made us feel super well taken care of.  The place itself is really nice, and the outdoor seating area was very beautiful and enjoyable.  Regarding parking, upon arrival it seems they only have valet parking (which I honestly do not like). We inquired about self parking and were told to enter the valet parking and drive past it. Towards the end of the lot there is a self parking section. Voila!",

If you're looking for an upscale but classic \"Old Arizona\" style restaurant, it doesn't get better than this. The service is always spectacular with knowledgeable and friendly waiters, and you feel taken care of from the moment you step out of your car.   The food is always top-notch, and usually has some interesting, unique menu options you might not get elsewhere (think rattlesnake, ostrich, etc). This year I went with the pecan-grilled filet mignon and was not disappointed. We also were very curious what a Churro Tree was, but you'll have to see my picture to find out for yourself!  I feel like eating at Lon's is more of an experience than just a meal - it's also about the atmosphere, the music, the lights, the decor, the service ... just wonderful.",

I had a Cobb salad, a perfect lunch considering we were going to have a very busy day and evening. Our small party ordered a myriad of other lunch items. All was excellent.  I would like to add that we were scheduled to have a catered lunch on site. We walked by it a few minutes prior to lunch time.  Our buffet was set up on long banquet tables topped with sandwiches. Fruits etc.  Unfortunately flies were attacking the food.  We opted not to eat our catered lunch for this reason.  The majority of our group didnt see what we saw.",

Dense caramel topped with a few nuts and covered with thick chocolate, sprinkled with salt. It really did taste like a candy bar, but one bite was enough for me. - Iced coffee was fine, but took forever to arrive and not worth $5.  Our server was friendly, but seemed to forget about things- like bringing a requested wine list or picking up or delivering the coffee orders, but honestly not a big deal since I'd prefer this over being rushed through brunch. Recommend, especially if the weather is nice enough to sit outside.",

Nothing but smiles and exceptional courteousness.  Onto the food..... Our server Kenny, had wonderful recommendations. We had a wood oven smoked pork chop and I had Halibut. So delicious!

Cooked perfectly rare, and paired with potatoes and truffle mac and cheese, it was the perfect dinner.  The staff was incredible from the moment we arrived at the complimentary valet, and every single person we interacted with was professional, but not stuffy or stuck up, making us feel perfectly at home.  Everything was perfect, from the ambiance to the wine. I could say more, but seriously, 5-stars.  Just go.  If you're looking for a romantic evening, I'd definitely suggest Lon's, and we will be headed back soon.",

    "text": "Excellent private dining experience. If you get dessert, go for the toffee pudding (Sooo great!).  Menu was great and food was delicious.   Atmosphere was even better.  Service was lacking, hence the four and not five stars.  Three problems:    1. I was part of a large group and I asked the server to change my order before he put in the ticket for the table.  The server was openly aggravated at my request.  I didn't like that.    2. The duck/gnocchi dish did not actually have any gnocchi in it.  It came with roasted veggies instead so that was a surprise.  Still delicious, but was not as advertised.  We received no prior warning from the server that gnocchi was not part of the dish.    3.  I ordered my fillet medium rare and it was served medium well.  I didn't touch it.  The server had nothing to say about it.",

    "text": "Now that I've had a few days to cool down I feel I can write a review about my experience at Lon's at Hermosa.  It saddens me to say that our experience was nothing like the exceptional reviews I read prior to bringing my family to Lon's. If I could give it zero stars I would.   On Thursday March 27th I brought my future in-laws (visiting from out of state & Switzerland) to Lon's to celebrate my recent engagement. Let me first say the hostess and the cocktail waitress were wonderful and kind however once we were sat the night took a turn for the worst. Our server Jason was the most condescending, disrespectful person I have ever met. When asking simple questions about the menu (like portion size and if he would recommend ordering starters, etc) he responded with \" Well this isn't Apple-bees\" along with rolling his eyes and a horribly rude tone while reluctantly answering us. ( If you like being treated like second class citizens then eat at Lon's and ask for Jason)  He brought my future-mother-in-law to tears when she asked some questions about the Salmon preparation and he came back with snarky remarks. We must have been inconveniencing him with normal questions.   I decided at this point to find a manager, Sean D. the manager on board that night was also very rude, and unhelpful. His response to my report was \"well do you just want to leave or have a new server\" His attitude was very take it or leave it, not what you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber. He also screamed in my future father in laws face ( very professional)   Needless to say we left and had to find another place to eat at 8:30 at night. It takes a lot of disrespect to up and leave a restaurant before even ordering, especially one you've had a reservation at for a week.   Thursday was supposed to be a special night for my family and I, but because of Sean and Jason's horrible customer service our night was ruined.  My family and I will NEVER set foot in this establishment again.",

We were immediately greeted by our very helpful waitress and given a brief history about Lon's. Very cool and interesting story! The food and drinks were delicious! The grounds are very well maintained and inviting. We took a tour of the wine cellar in the lower area, stunning! A perfect place to rent out for a birthday party or really any intimate event. I can't wait to go back for happy hour, nibbles by the fire and live music. Also plenty of parking available as well as valet. A fantastic hidden (for us non locals) gem! Can't wait to visit and dine again!",

From the time we walked through the southwestern garden to the end of our meal, we felt taken care of.  The southwestern garden is romantic and floral.  The servers were falling over themselves to help us.  Furthermore, the sommelier was helpful and the scene was very romantic.  The food was pretty good.  We had the seared ahi tuna on the Himalayan salt rock, the Wagyu beef and the short rib.  I thought the menu options were a bit safe, and it did seem like a dated menu.  However, the food was pretty good.  The seared ahi tuna was fun, the wagyu beef was good and had a foie gras tarragon.  The beef short rib was very yummy.  We left enough room for the chocolate mousse and that was pretty awesome too.  Overall I'd give the ambiance and service five stars with the food getting four stars.  Overall ***** for the experience!  It was so good, we thought about having a mini staycation at some point so we could try one of their adorable casitas.",

The hostess and maitre d' greeted me warmly and seated me at a small table beside the fountain. I thought I had found the perfect place to enjoy dinner. Unfortunately my waiter was not so attentive as it took too long to take my drink order and then too long to take my food order. I basically felt ignored. (Full Disclosure: I mentioned my frustration to the maitre d' who was very apologetic and ultimately compensated me for part of my meal.) With that said, the duck that I ordered was absolutely wonderful. The duck breast was cooked perfectly, very flavorful and was plated with gnocchi.  Had I not experiences the service glitch, I would have given Lon's a full five stars. I am sure this was not normal for Lon's but for me, it gave a less than desirable impression.",

As we left, no one took the time to say good bye to us or the other guest. The manager was on his cell phone more interested in texting than paying attention to his guest.  However, the best part of the experience was the valet service. The young man was  prompt, courteous and did all the right things.  I would promote him to client services manager!  Lon's is no longer the dining gem as it was in the past.  Lon's use to be my family's favorite place to dine. Very sad.",

    "text": "We've been fans of Lon's for years. The patio, the dining room, the food, was always dependable and a cut above.  For Sunday brunch, I ordered the chopped salad.  When it arrived I thought I'd been transported to a fast food take out. Iceberg lettuce, 2 pieces of dark green lettuce, 3 microscopic pieces of chicken, and a decorative something or other on top...I have never, did I say never, sent anything back in a restaurant, but back this went. I reordered the turkey burger, which another in my party had and hadn't complained about. The waiter was most gracious and accommodating. The side salad with the burger was fine. The burger was dry and tasteless; my husband later said that his was too. The other two people in our party had omelettes and were very pleased with their selection.  All in all it was a disappointing experience. I don't know if this will continue to be our \"go to\" place for lunch and brunch. The kitchen needs a jolting heads up and perhaps a new chef.",

    "text": "After having treated my palate to incredible eateries from Paris to New York to Yountville to Mexico City, I can testify with full and complete confidence that Lon's is absolutely world class: always amazing, always perfect in every way. It can best be described as Franco-Southwestern, or Escoffier goes upscale cowboy (how do you say yeeee-haaaa en Francais?). Before I had moved to AZ, I had never tasted, nor did I want to try \"southwestern\" cuisine. Sadly, I had bought into all the cultural stereotypes of commercialized-\"Navajo rug\"-touristy kitschiness....boy was I wrong. A good friend of mine, an Italian Baron, wanted to sample the western part of the US. The first place I brought him to was Lon's. Now, Italians, especially Italian aristocrats, are absolute food snobs, which is great: they don't settle for anything less than the best, freshest seasonal quality food because that is simply the food culture in that gorgeous country! He was very well impressed with the beauty of Lon's, the quality and innovativeness of the menu...everything haute-desert, very very cool indeed! They also serve one of the best Prosecco wines very hard to find: that of Prosecco Franco from Valdobiaddene, the winery of a beautiful family and good friends of mine. Get some, it's awesome! Lon's: fit for all, from aristocrat to lil' 'ol me. The food speaks for itself. Damn! If this place was out here in LA, it would corner the market just for its very unique menu! Tanti auguri, bravi!!",

    "text": "When is Yelp going to let me award half stars, as this place is clearly deserving of 4.5 stars.   Lon's is one of those fine dining establishments that truly captures the essence of old time Arizona, yet brings forth an amazing array of top notch cuisine. The fine dining clearly compliments the rich history that rests within the walls of the establishment.   Lon was an artist who created primarily western/cowboy inspired work and was the primary artist for the Mallory-Stetson Cowboy hat brand. The restaurant is his former residence, and the current owner has gone above and beyond the call of duty in an effort to preserve the essence of Lon's cowboy-ness. Lon's original art pieces are throughout the restaurant and bar, as well as an amazing aray of western decor.  Apparently Lon was quite a colorful person as evidenced by his multitude of wives and the apropriate tranformation of his former bedroom into the current bar at the restaurant.  Although it was too warm to sit on the patio, in cooler times the restaurant facilitates patio dining. I was diappointed we were unable to do this, as the western feel transends right out of the front door and onto the bungalo style patio where you can only imagine Lon endulged in his fair share of eat and drink.   If you think you are headed in the wrong direction when traveling to Lon's, think again, as it is located in the middle of a residential neighborhood among the most elite Paradise Valley estates.   I figured I should stick with beef, granted that Lon epitomized the idea of a cowboy, so I ordered the Spare Rib. This plate was cooked to perfection, as the meat literally melted in my mouth. In addition, I tried a bite of the salmon that was delicious, but who the hell orders salmon at a western themed restaurant in the middle of the desert? I highly reccomend the tomatoe basil salad, but wished there was a little more than a couple slices of tomato.....as soon as my juices started flowing, the tomato juice was already gone!  The restaurant was empty and quiet, but it was the middle of the week. The staff was friendly to the point that our party forked out an above average tip, which by our standards, means they did their job.   The real kicker came after we paid the bill. As we were exploring the rest of the restaurant, the bar tender took it upon herself to give our party a tour of the areas that don't immediately meet the eye. As she brought us into the library, she began telling us the stories of how Lon and some of his lady friends continue to haunt the library and other parts of the restaurant. Although I used to shudder at Unsolved Mysteries as a child, the creepiness of her tour made our visit to Lon's that much more exciting and appreciated. The bartender then led us to the wine cellar where a plethora of fine wines riddled the racks. The wine cellar is available for private dinners, and if I was in a place to financially facilitate such a feast, I definitely would.  I highly reccomend this restaurant not just for the food, but for the amazing service, the historical significance, the overall feel of the restaurant, and the eerie but amazingness of the haunting of Lon's spirit!",

The setting is really quite nice...what you would expect from an upscale location in Arizona: a tranquil southwestern ranch-style building and decor.  The meal was very good, though, thinking back I can't remember anything remarkable about it.  Our entire group seemed pleased with their meals as I recall, yet I don't remember anyone raving about it.  I actually had to look up their menu on their website to remember what I ordered - but even that didn't jog my memory.  Usually, if a meal is exceptional, I remember every detail.  Not so with Lon's, so I just can't give it 5 stars.",

The volume was perfect for a conversation and the private room was sized perfectly. Ordering went flawlessly and the server was knowledgable and easily made recommendations for us. The timing of the appetizers, main course and dessert was also flawless. The food itself was excellent, everyone enjoyed their meal. After dinner and despite the fact that we were the only people left in the restaurant we were treated to a private tour of the restaurant which was previously the home of an artist.

I never knew I liked grits but with goat cheese.... Yum... It was a hit! The truffle scented mac and cheese.... Mmmmm... Not so much. It did not taste nor smell like the wonderfully truffley aroma that I love! Disappointing. All in all the food was pretty worth it.

There were only two or three other tables on the patio, and yes, of course we sat on the patio.  After hearing so much about it, how could we not?  Unfortunately, it was still a little warmer than normal for September, but it wasn't too bad.  Either way, the patio is nice and I would much rather sit outside than inside.  Karen was our server and she was great!  Full of knowledge, but not pushy with it.  She let us know we could take the bottle of wine home if we didn't finish it (always good to know which places do this and which ones don't).  And told us that they grow a lot of their own herbs and produce to try and be self-sustaining.  +1 Lons!  As far as the \"tasting menu\" (or RW menu) goes, the verdicts when something like . . . Hermosa Salad, good. Calamari, great. Flatiron Steak, great. Jidori Chicken, good. Almond Roca, great. Peach Cobbler, great.   So good dinner, delicious wine, amazing service and beautiful patio, even if it was still warm out.  A perfect place to enjoy AZ when the weather is nice and maybe even celebrate a special occasion.",

If you want a really nice place to have a good conversation-you'll love it. The food and drink. The bar staff is very helpful and we all got drinks we loved.  The food, while very good, was not memorable.  We had a few appetizers-the mixed grill and the squash blossoms. Both good but underwhelming-i can't really comment on anything extraordinary about them. we were all a bit surprised at the size ( very small) of the dishes. The entrees were portioned much bigger. ( not that bigger is better!) Two of us had the salmon, while cooked nicely, the flavors were just so-so and the semolina gnocchi was gritty and under-seasoned as well. The others had the pork dish ( meh) and the steak-it was( again) good, very good but not WOW. The prices are high so it's a special occasion kind of place. I have to say. I have had more memorable food at places like North or Tuck Shop or St Francis.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix for business, traveling alone, and based on the reviews decided to go to Lon's for dinner.  I wanted a nice outdoor seating environment. While I enjoyed my dining experience, there were several factors that prevented Lon's from being a five-star dinner in my book.    If you are traveling on business, or eating with work colleagues, I would not recommend Lon's. On the night that I ate there, it appeared to be predominately patronized by retirees.  It was a leisurely crowd, as opposed to a more urban, more serious crowd.  This is not to say that the customers were not enjoying their meals, but if you are a business traveler in a suit or eating alone, you would definitely feel out of place at Lon's amongst those 60-and-70-somethings meeting friends for a long dinner.  I also had the impression that it was the type of place you might go for an anniversary, or special birthday.  There was a large group of 8 people celebrating a family occasion.  It lacked the seriousness of the types of places i like to go to when I travel for business.  That's not the restaurant's fault at all, but prospective customers should be aware of the target market at Lon's.  What the restaurant is responsible for is overcooking my rack of lamb, which at a surprise $68, ought to have been cooked perfectly and included a bit more on the plate.  The price on the menu indicated \"market price\" but I would never have guessed at the actual price.  I really should have returned the lamb, but was trying to enjoy my evening and didn't want to make a big deal out of something that was totally edible and for which I would be submitting my receipt for reimbursement.  Nevertheless, i was just not impressed with the quality of the food for the price.  My waiter was very good, although was FAR more attentive to the tables with four people than he was even to the tables with two people.  He chatted up the four-toppers, while leaving us two-toppers and singles to linger.    The outdoor dining patio was very nice, although it was quite dark.  While I am only 36 years old, I had a great deal of difficulty seeing the details of my meal while I was eating it, and the waiter actually used a flashlight to illuminate it as it was being served to me so that I could \"see what I paid for.\"    Overall, Lon's was very nice, but the kind of place I would take my mom for mother's day or her birthday.  I won't go back for a business dinner, and probably won't go back when I am in town again in a few weeks.  I just didn't connect with it.  Lon's had every opportunity to make me a \"raving fan\" of it's food, service, and atmosphere, and it failed to do so despite its positive attributes.",

It's a cute little restaurant that is in the middle of a residential block in Paradise Valley.  They offered complimentary valet parking which is always a plus.  It's got a country/western theme and does a good job with its fine dining yet business casual feel.    The food and wine was spectacular.  I had been dying to try their chicken with mashed potatoes and loved it.  The portions were large enough that I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  They also had a truffle mac and cheese which was just as delicious.  Their wine list was superb and we were able to try a rare Cabernet at a reasonable price.  Finally, their bread and butter basket was super.  The butter was so good I could have eaten a tub of it by myself.  The service was just as good as the food.  Out waitress was attentive yet gave us our space.  One of the things I get nervous about when going out for fancy dinners is having to deal with condescending restaurant staff since we tend to be on the younger side of their demographic.  This was not a problem whatsoever at  Lon's.  This is an amazing restaurant with some delicious food.",

    "text": "I wish I could say nice things all the way around.   From the moment of driving in,  I loved the look of the surroundings. Was a little taken aback by the mandatory valet parking but relaxed when I saw it was complimentary - a very nice touch.   The place was crowded with people who all seemed (for lack of a better word) relaxed. Well heeled too I'm sure. I was going to a college alumnae club event, but wasn't sure I would go so far for brunch on my own.   Once we went into the building, it was really cool to imagine it being someone's private home - it was very welcoming! As were the people. The friendliness and quality of service was excellent.   However, given the price, I was very surprised and disappointed with the food. For brunch, there was a plate of small breakfast breads on the table - for 8 people we each got one. No one asked if we wanted more, or offered the fruits or breakfast meats included in the brunch.   We also had our choice of 3 possible entrees. Being on an Eggs Benedict kick, I naturally gravitated to that. Mentally, I had a moment of fondly remembering the Daily Dose with their 7 options - here there was one.    When it came, it was short on Hollandaise. There was a tiny pile of potatoes on the side, mixed with some orange (squash?) vegetables. Now, at the risk of sounding really nit-picky, but I would have liked to know what \"hacienda potatoes\" were before getting them and the option to get them plain. The whole plate (artistic vision aside) just looked empty before I even touched it ...  Anyway, the potatoes were left. I left hungry.  MH's strawberry and mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast was ok, too sweet for my taste.   Given the gaps in what they advertised and what we were offered, I figured it was roughly an extra $12 per person for unlimited coffee and the one pastry.   The coffee was surprisingly good. We filled up at a central station, and the server refilled our cups for us. Very nice of him, since he had to walk to the urn for each cup. No cream on the table - surprising - so he had to make a couple repeat trips. Not for me, after the first time - I hate to put people out to do things like this for me - but you'd think it would be better planned.   So my experience was mixed. Surroundings and service awesome - food not so much. Value for money - very low. If I enjoyed everything it would have been worth it but as it was, no. If I had a choice I would rather go to Daily Dose and donate the difference balance to charity.",

Our bill totalled $850 and was paid for on our host's expense account so no personal money was wasted but it still REALLY bothered me how HORRIBLE and DISGRACEFUL both the service and the food were. Appetizers were not served and when we remind our waiter, RIchard, he had the nerve to charge us for the one we still wanted! The food was really inconsistent--our host did not like his cauliflower soup or snapper. Desert orders were taken in bits and pieces JUST TO NAME A FEW OF THE PROBLEMS. It makes no sense how a seemingly fine fine fine restaurant can have such poor service and do nothing in the end for its guests. The whole experience was really mind-bending since the potential was tremendous and the result so poor.",

We were still a bit bummed that we weren't dining on the beach, though, so Lon's had a lot to live up to to salvage the night.  Fortunately, our dinner was phenomenal :)  The setting was really romantic - we sat out on the patio right in front of the fireplace, and the moon provided just enough light for the meal.  We ordered the chef's tasting ($75 per person) with wine pairings (and extra $35).  Every course was delicious:  - Oysters - Charcuterie plate with rabbit confit - Seared scallops over brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes - Sliced kobe beef with gnocchi - Some chocolate orange pot de creme type of dessert  The standouts of the night were the rabbit confit (moist and flavorful) and the gnocchi (incredibly light and airy) - if these are offered as part of the regular menu, order them!  We left after a 2.5 hour dinner happy and tipsy, completely letting go of the airport fiasco - for that reason alone: 5 stars!  *Note to others: Check in for international flights a full 60 minutes ahead of time, even if you're not checking bags.  And yes, although it may not seem like Mexico should count, it does.",

The table was empty of decor except for a glass votive with a cheap oil light insert (maybe they could get more creative and hide the oil light insert).  The wall next to our table had food and stains on it. We opted for the summer three course special and the first course was the first indication of the chef being out of town.  The food was not seasoned and the basil on the heirloom tomato salad was just large leaves thrown on top.  For fine dining have they not heard of chiffonade for garnishing?  The main courses were nice but also lacking seasoning.  By the time our main course came it became apparent the room was over  80 degrees.  The waiter told us the a/c could not be turned down any further because the just opened the room we were seated in due to the dining room being full.  The dining room was only half full. There is nothing worse then getting dressed up and ending the dining experience sweaty and uncomfortable.",

We received a tour of the rooms where the movie was filmed, the history of property and an exclusive tour of the wine cellar! It was gorgeous!   The staff were awesome and extremely helpful! A definite team atmosphere as other servers pitched in when our server was assisting other patrons.   The food was great! Very fresh ingredients! We even got a glimpse of fresh meat spinning on the smoker!   I would highly recommend and will definitely return when if ever in the area!!",

As we were driving there I kept thinking to myself \"I hope I get through dinner without getting bit by a rattlesnake.\"   But out of nowhere came this adorable sprawl of a restaurant with a fountain and twinkling lights.  I started my night off with a Hermosa Mule - their take on a Moscow.  It was delicious.  My party moved on to wine and appetizers.   Included was calamari, kobe beef carpaccio, and the ahi tuna.   All were delicious, cooked and prepared perfectly.   I also tried a pinot noir that I took a picture of and I hope I can find it again.  I'm a big fan of beef so I ordered the Tenderloin.  Wow.  Tender, juicy and completely flavorful.   It came with a few accompaniments including a creamed spinach that was to die for.   Everyone in the party was extremely happy with their meal.  I heard compliments on the Three Little Pigs, the Short Ribs, and the Salmon.  Our service was excellent.   They were right on top of it with the wine and they cleared our plates quickly and were very patient with us when we wanted to sit a little longer and talk.  I highly recommend Lon's for dinner and drinks.  The atmosphere is quite cool, the food is off the charts, and the service is spot on.",

It is spectacular from the moment you arrive and walk down a pathway lit romantically with lanterns. Although we weren't able to sit outside due to a recent rainstorm, it was beautifully strung with lights, is surrounded by gardens of flowers, and has a cozy fireplace. The waitstaff were attentive, friendly, and filled with wonderful suggestions.  The food was both interesting and delicious.  I highly recommend the pecan-smoked filet mignon and the truffle mac and cheese.  Every person we encountered in the restaurant wished us a happy anniversary and I finally figured out it was because there was a small \"corsage\" of flowers on our table indicating a special occasion.  I thought that was such a unique and thoughtful touch!  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Oh Lon's at the Hermosa! Another place on my list it took me way too long to visit and review. My experience here was exquisite, simply put. The views of the sunset from our fountain side table were unbeatable. The romantic ambience combined with the perfectly executed food is why I give this spot five stars.   In True Taylor fashion, I started with half dozen oysters with citrus pomegranate cilantro mignonette. The oysters were fresh and HUGE, without having the overly fishy taste that sometimes accompanies the larger size. We also ordered the Hamachi tartare served with jalapeno relish, shaved fennel, baby greens, mint, and coconut yuzu dressing. This was a definite home run with the perfect blend of spice and crunch from the jalapeno and fennel.   For my entree, I ordered the maple leaf duck breast. Perfectly tender and melt in your mouth good. I didn't want to share! Of course I am a great date so I did. I am not normally a fan of peas but the puree was a great accent to the dish. Presentation was also top notch. We ordered a bottle of the Justin Cabernet Sauvignon as recommended to us by our server and were not disappointed.   The experience was fabulous, the food was incredible, and there was a bonus Jerry Jones sighting to add to the memory bank!",

The service was good; the food was decent as well, but I thought it was definitely on the high side, price-wise, even for an upscale venue like this in Paradise Valley.  They asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion and we said yes, we had a birthday in our party. They made it a point to note that and our server offered a birthday greeting, but nothing else occurred. Not that we were expecting something but since they made it a point to ask, we kind of thought they were going to bring us a drink, appetizer or dessert-or do something. Ended up being disappointed by that just because they seemed to set us up for something; had they not said anything, it wouldn't have been an issue whatsoever.",

    "text": "Celebrated a bday dinner here for the girlfriend while also staying a couple nights here at the Hermosa as well.   The staff was fantastic both at the Last Drop bar & for Lon's table service, very courteous & knowledgeable.  The food is actually reasonably priced, but not as \"cutting-edge\" as they advertise on their website.   During the first evening the fish tacos at the bar were overcooked and dry, but the drinks were decently crafted and there is a fun selection of tequila and mezcal.   For dinner we skipped the starters & dove right into the side and entrees: Mac & cheese, broccolini, & mashed potatoes all of which were well made, flavorful, and pretty much what you would traditionally expect.   After having overcooked fish the first night i decided to skip the halibut that was tempting me & went with the pecan grilled filet, cooked blue rare with no char. Came out great & paired well with our 2 bottles of Hall Cabernet.  (Speaking of which, the wine list pricing is excessive. Many of which are marked up 3x retail)  The bday girl ordered the Wagyu strip also blue rare, no char, but it came out med rare. Thankfully, it was such a great piece of meat that it was still very enjoyable cooked further than desired so there wasnt a need to send it back.   Another guest of ours ordered the short ribs, which were very flavorful and their plate was cleaned spotless so apparently the polenta was also pretty tasty.   The charcuterie plate is probably one of the best you'll ever have since their prosciutto is made (& aged) in house in their cellar. So spicy & delicious.   The cowboy candy bar & peach desserts were fun desserts to cap off a very good meal on their romantic garden patio.",

    "text": "Lon's at the Hermosa will go down as one of my favorite places to have a special dinner. A VERY special dinner. Lon's is more thus just a place to dine though, Lon's is an experience. It's the place you go to pop the question; to seal the big deal; to meet the parents and impress them beyond all words. Lon's is the place where you take someone or people who are worth premium everything and by premium, I mean THE BEST. I took my husband here on his birthday; selfishly because it is my favorite restaurant in all of the valley. I made sure we took an Uber and got here for happy hour at The Last Drop, so we could enjoy some bubbly while watching the sun set over the mountains. Lon's is a quiet oasis.. set in Paradise Valley under the shadows of Camelback you would never know you were within a hundred miles of a city when you are here. We had our drinks on the patio and enjoyed our favorite starter : The Foie Gras. I can't say enough about the foie gras here; its buttery and rich and creamy and is served in a ramekin that begs you to take a heaping spoonful rather than a smidge and smather it upon the house made bread and top with some of the also , housemade jam. Just a tad. This is the best foie gras I've had in the UNited States. That's quite a feat. We moved over to Lon's amazing patio for our dinner reservation. Live music is usually played here on the weekends and tonight was no exception. It completely added to the perfection of this fall night. I recommend Lon's patio in the Fall and Spring.. as its one of the most amazing patios in the area for dining under the stars. It's even better if you can secure a table either by the fireplace when it's lit or front and center to the live music. The wine list is extensive , start there. If you can't figure it out, don't worry, Lon's has a sommelier on hand to guide you. We love the Caduceus wines that are actually from here in ArIzona. However, there are so many , it's hard to choose. We started this night with a Shrimp Cocktail. Lon's was still under their summer menu; as the menu changes for the season and as much as can be is grown on property, be it a vegetable or herbs. They buy locally when ever possible and it adds to the quality of their meals. The seafood is flown in daily. Our prawns were massive; the size of my fist , a small fist , but you get it! The sauce was perfect and they were served on a Himalayan Salt Block to add to the taste and presentation. I ordered the Pecan Filet. This ample 6-7oz filet came with Lyonnaise Potatoes and creamed greens.  You can have the Foie Gras added for $18 and is buttery and decadent, BUT, I had my share of Foie Gras tonight.. I'm advising tho, do it ! The potatoes were perfection , buttery and perfect with the right amount of red wine Demi glace from the filet. For dessert we were treated to a birthday treat for my husband : Lon's Famous Cowboy Candy Bar! Trust me , after all that you eat and sip here , this is shareable with two! Chili Chocolate Ganache , millefuille pastry , salted caramel and caramel ice cream with a little crunch make this so unique and why would it not be? It's Lon's after all! There is a wine cellar below the main dining room that I have always been curious about seeing; apparently it's for private events and one , well, many! Can dine amongst the wines and also get to take a tour of the cellar. Local bucket list! I always hate when the night at Lon's ends and I have always asked my husband , 'Why did we not just book one of the casitas and stay??' Haha .. he always says , 'Next year ... ' . Until then, I will keep looking for special reasons to come to Lon's at the Hermosa... I seriously love everything about it.",

    "text": "MEN: READ MORE FOR AN EASY DATE IDEA! My boyfriend surprised me with a simple Happy Hour date night here the other night. He came home, pulled me away from my computer and insisted that we head straight to a surprise location. His goal was to watch the sunset but unfortunately their gorgeous patio was pretty secluded and we couldn't really see it. However, I must say that it was still the most romantic date spot!! It was literally a sanctuary. They had relaxing live music that started at 6 PM (you may want to call first to confirm if they will have it on the night that you decide to go), fire pits everywhere, candles, white lights strung throughout, $6 drink specials and $4 bar snacks with other delicious appetizers (Their chips, salsa, and guac were heavenly!). An appetizer trio that comes on a pretty dish was $15. Beyond the drinks and apps, this place is sure to send your significant other's heart wild. When we left, I felt like I had just relaxed all day at the Spa!   Here are their daily specials!:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhermosainn.com%2Flons%2Flast-drop-bar%2Fevents%2Fhappy-hour.shtml&s=bae1aaa1ae196c743725e33ab6ad810cebaa6d4f521b7e44a770905809c7aa94\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hermosainn.com/lons/last...</a>",

    "text": "My wife and I just enjoyed a wonderful dinner here at Lon's. Their menu for Arizona Restaurant Week looked enticing; since I have greatly enjoyed eating at Lon's before, we decided to go tonight. Dined at sunset on the patio; peaceful and relaxing.  We started off with the tasty house margarita, and a potpourri of breads (including slices of Mesquite sourdough from Noble Bakery).  For the three course dinner, we began with the crab stuffed squash blossom - served with a cucumber gazpacho and the Abbey Lee heirloom tomatoes with Crow's Dairy goat cheese curd, herb salad, Noble (bakery) croutons, with a white and red balsamic. Both appetizers were fabulous -  Next, we both decided to each order the Alaskan halibut entree, served with a Meyer lemon foam, pea puree, snap peas, baby carrots, ?shitake mushrooms and other young mushrooms along with spring onions. The halibut was perfectly cooked, with a moist interior; the vegetables along with the lemon foam were a perfect match. (other entrees for this week include roasted Petaluma chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes and brocollin, or a dry aged Duroc pork chop with purple barley rissoto, pickled peach chicaron salad and romesco sauce) Finishing off, we chose the Meyer lemon cheesecake served with lemon curd and blueberry gelato and the Schnepf farms peach crostata topped with salted caramel ice cream and streusel. Both were outstanding - this is indeed the prime season for the Schnepf farm peaches. As always, service was impeccable, always attentive, never intrusive. Water glasses were kept full, plates promptly cleared, second round of bread service readily brought, and each course brought out at perfect serving temperature.  After dinner, we strolled around the beautiful gardened grounds and enjoyed the art work of Lon Megargee displayed on the walls of the main restaurant. (This was once his residence: he is best known for his \"The Last Drop From His Stetson\" which is still used today in the lining of many Stetson western hats)  If you want a great AZ Restaurant Week meal, with impeccable service in a fabulous location, definitely consider Lon's at the Hermosa Inn. Even if you come another time, Lon's is an Arizona classic. The casitas at the Hermosa Inn are also a wonderful place to stay. (sorry that I forgot to take pictures of each dish, we were enjoying them so much to the final crumb that I never snapped a shot!)",

We had our children with us ages 14-22 and there were 7 of us in total. I will start by saying we celebrated our anniversary there in October and the service, food and atmosphere were amazing. However, after my birthday dinner on Dec 28, 2018 I will never ever go back and will NEVER recommend it to anyone. The restaurant is way to expensive to have bad food and ok service. I ordered the sea bass and it was inedible. It arrived cold and the fish was disgusting. The waiter never came back to ask how things were. Since it was my birthday I didn't want to hurt my husbands feelings and complain since he surprised me with the location. When the waiter cleared our plates he noticed my dinner had barely been touched. He asked if I wanted it wrapped up. I said no because it wasn't good and he shrugged his shoulders and moved on to clear my sons plate. A few other notes - Our reservation was at 7:45pm and around 9 music came on out of now where. Very random. On a side note the part of the restaurant we were in had no lights or Christmas/festive decor. By 10pm the restaurant was empty and we felt like we needed to leave. However the quality and taste of the food is the reason why you should not waste your time or money. There are many great restaurants in the area and this one is not worth it!!!",

We had the Chef's Selection (5-course pre fix menu $69) on our 1st visit to Lon's at the Hermosa with the 5 paired wines ($35) and it was nothing short of amazing. Flavors we'd never tasted began with a squash soup, followed by a squash & pasta course, scallop & risotto, 3 types of pork with grilled root vegetables, mango sorbet and pumpkin pie--all with accompanying 3-ounce pours of select wines.   We have been in 30 counties, great hotels & cruise ships & never had a better meal--- but that's not all. The patio was beautiful with a clear sky, full moon, great music, heaters to chase away the chill, a roaring fireplace and great service.  We will be regulars at Lon... And if they can't match that night -- it's ok. I can't imagine a more amazing night!  Thanks for the memory",

We love the valet parking, the intimate outdoor setting, the views of the mountain and the open sky, and just the overall general atmosphere of the grounds of the Hermosa Inn.  And the food is simply delightful! We've only had dinner here, but look forward to having breakfast here one day in the fall / winter.  We have tried the Halibut, the Salmon, the Chops, and have always been impressed not only with the flavor, but also with the presentation. Truly marvelous to behold, and appetizing as well.   When we visit, it's just fun to sit and chat with my wife as we enjoy the serenity of the area, and the delicious food. And the service is par excellence!  We wholeheartedly recommend this place for special occasions, or a date with that special someone.   Of course, to this day, I've had the pleasure of enjoying those special evenings here with my wife, my pal, my best friend!",

    "text": "Hands down, this is my favorite place to visit when I am in the Phoenix area.  I've been to Lon's several times now, and I have loved it every time.  I have only been for dinner; I see many of the lesser reviews are from people who visited for brunch.  I will stick to dinner so my five-star bubble remains in tact.    My visits have included stops by the bar for dinner after flying into Phoenix, New Year's Eve dinner, and several romantic dinners with my boyfriend.     First, let's talk about the location and atmosphere.  While you can do your own accurate research, Lon's is basically a ranch house-turned restaurant.  It is in Paradise Valley, so your trek to Lon's will be through dark unlit streets and neighborhoods.  You may pass it up if you don't know what to look for, so be sure to map it out in advance.  I am not from Phoenix, so I leave the driving to my bf.  Valet is complimentary.    I have never been seated outside, but I imagine it would be dreamy if the weather and company were right.  They have fires and heat lamps.  I have eaten in the bar, and I have been seated in the indoor dining area.  I was content with both.  The servers have always been outstanding and knowledgeable, offering advice and suggestions and explanations when asked.    The food, in my opinion, has always been perfect.  Yes, it is somewhat pricey, but you get what you pay for at Lon's!  Two weeks ago, I had the seared salmon.  It was cooked to perfection, and the flavor was divine.  I also finally ordered the truffle-scented mac and cheese.  It is extremely rich, and I overate, but that's what Lon's is all about, I guess.  I only do it a couple of times a year.  I am comfortable in suggesting that if it looks good in the menu description, it will go above your expectations.    Lon's may not be for everyone, but if you've never been, you must visit at least once!  I can almost promise you'll want to return.",

First off, they have an excellent wine list;  I tried both the Malbec and the Zinfandel.  Very tasty and a pretty generous pour! We started with a caprese-ish salad of campari tomatoes and house made mozzarella, and for an entree I had the pork tenderloin and crispy pork belly.  It was served with a braised pear, grits, and sauteed broccolini.  If it were at all appropriate, I would have licked the plate.  My tenderloin was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium) and the pork belly just melted as I ate it.  We finished up with a huckleberry pie which, having grown up in Montana, reminded me of home.   This dinner wasn't cheap, but for the experience I had, I was happy to pay it, and can't wait to go back.",

All of us are food and wine lovers, so our expectations are high, and Lon's exceeded our expectations.   Had dinner at Michael Mina's at the Scottsdale Princess the night before, which was so-so and quite ordinary by comparison.",

The menu is limited and prices are high- which is okay for a special occasion. The wine is good and the service (the first time) was excellent. This second time- the service was good but not above board as it should be in a find dining establishment. Dinner was not as good as it was the first time we were there- everything was impeccable two years ago and I just kept thinking that there was a change in the chef.  At the end of the meal- our waiter informed us that that a new chef has indeed taken over and recently changed the menu. I asked how the change was being received and he said very well. Which I find confusing because there is a significant difference in quality, presentation and taste. We left unfulfilled.",

They were generous pours and I definitely got my $12 worth.  Jules was friendly and attentive and kept track of which girl was on which wine.   We tried Lon's food special- three appetizers for $15. A seemingly good deal, but the portions are quite small. But there was enough for each girl to have a nibble of each item.   Lon's is a fun place for girlfriends to meet or a date with your honey. It would also be great to take my parents to next time they're in town. The patio is quite beautiful and I cannot wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy some wine out there.",

    "text": "I am SOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed to say that Lon's *USED TO BE* my favorite restaurant.    Without reading the below positive reviews I can tell you they are most likely True.  The atmosphere is still amazing and the scenery is beautiful.  Lons has always been our go-to place for special occasions and out of town guests due to its hacienda type feel with being too desert-y.  This is exactly why I requested my 30th birthday be held at Lons when my large NY family arrived unexpectedly from out of town.    I can say the restaurant is 1000 times different since acquiring a new chef and not in a good way :(  The menu seemed very 'I just graduated culinary school and here are all my most impressive dishes.'  The wait staff has turned over in the last year and the new servers are not classically trained and did not seem to have even been given the basics (IE Sir, Ma'am, pointing at the guests.....when we asked for meal recommendations he actually said \"Anything but the chicken.  Because its...chicken\") Although I saw the sommelier lurking around the restaurant he never once approached our table.  The wine steward was pompous and not at all helpful...instead of making suggestions when asked he instead said he had the perfect thing and left our table without mentioning what it was!    As to the menu....To begin with every single appetizer on the menu involved seafood.  This was annoying because A) my boyfriend does not eat seafood and B) its fricken Arizona people!  How fresh CAN it be?? Even the soup was of the ocean.    The good: My sister and I ordered the caprese salad (which was titled something silly and ostentatious)  It was the highlight of the meal, truly exceptional and served with tiny heirloom cherry tomatoes.  I had the beef tenderloin which was also very good but served on a brick of par boiled and pan seared potatoes which was tasteless and made me wonder why rich people are too good for mash potatoes.  The bad: my sister ordered the sea bass which was served with clams.  Not only were the clams bad (bitter/spoiled flavor), the sea bass tasted off.  (I was doubly embarrassed for Lon's as I had assured her Sea bass is usually brought in from Mexico and especially fresh).  She didn't want to mention it to the server but considering we were celebrating I felt it was important she enjoy her experience and let the server know the CHEF needed to know the clams were bad.  The manager came out and not only implied she didn't know what she was talking about \"Just to let you know, the chef is preparing a 2nd batch to taste them and make sure they're good\"  he did not replace the dish (although he did offer.  Shouldn't he have sent out a replacement ANYWAY??? or something..../) He continued to monitor our table the rest of the evening with a distinct 'Have the complainers left yet?' air.  To be honest I am so disgusted in the changes at Lons I'm just going to list the rest out for you to consider.  Lon's is not a bad restaurant....its simply not the excellent gem it once was :(    1) Only 1 chocolate dish on the dessert menu.  2) My favorite-a truly spectacular and unique dessert- the almond roca- is long gone.  3) Dessert chef sent out my birthday 'huckelberry tartlet' without acknowledgement of special occasion.  4) Poor server tried to rectify by bringing out 3 tiny dessert chocolates with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate which would have been truly awesome if there had been enough for all 9 of us and he hadn't had to write in chocolate himself- which was sloppy and kind of sad.  Obviously the kitchen was done with our table.   5) FYI...skip the huckelberry tart.  Remember hostess fruit pies?  Different shape, same flavor.   6) Although it was a week night I truly never expected to be sat next to a family wearing shorts, sneakers and t-shirts in the dining room.  We were obviously dressed black tie and celebrating a special occasion.  Seriously?   7) Even the hostess was annoyed when we arrived on time for our reservation.  She asked us if we wanted to sit in the lounge but I can assure you my 90 year old grandmother would rather sit down where we're eating.  She proceeded to ignore us for 5 minutes while we waited to be sat.    Finally, I would like to mention that I don't mean to sound low brow .....but for close to $1000 I expected a special, memorable experience.  While I assume my family will remember Lon's, unfortunately it will be as the worst dinner we had during their vacation.",

    "text": "Boy was not as impressed as I but I thought it was good and worth mentioning.   We went for restaurant week, which I have learned can either be good or bad. (During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu) I was impressed by Lon's.  Ambiance: Excellent although next time we will request a patio seat. If it isn't 100 degrees outside, I suggest you do the same.   Staff was excellent. Our server was introduced to us as \"Frenchie.\" We immediately found out why. She was thorough and thoughtful with her recommendations.  Food: Now here is where it gets complicated. I had the chilled pea soup and I thought it was really great. Flavor was good, ingredients and style were all appropriate for the weather. The roasted chicken was my next course and  thought this was great too. Overall, excellent food until I tried the boy's calamari- not so much. I know many people appreciate large portions but the law of diminishing returns applies to one's appetite as well. The calamari was large, deep fried and piled high. Bloated and uncomfortable after consuming large quantities of fried food, he wasn't even slightly hungry after he finished the first course. Now, I know, he could have stopped eating the on his own. I agree. he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef's part as well or at least a warning \"Caution: you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari\". Needless to say he was not impressed at all with his second course, the hanger steak.   Wine: lots of options- very pleased.",

Not that Scottsdale is \"obscure\", but it is still unexpected, and we chose Lon's without much local help. It was a total shot in the dark.  Went on a Monday night. The place was empty, but it was still charming. The story is that the location was actually Lon's house (he lived in the early 1900's), and has been remodeled into a restaurant. It's in a residential neighborhood, but has complementary valet, and also huge patio areas, if you can take the heat (not us, clearly... ha).   The service was great, because the restaurant was deserted and we got both waitresses. The bread basket was overflowing with 4 different kinds of bread. We had Prosecco to drink which I looooveeeeeeee.  For an appetizer, I had the House Salad which has toasted pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and a Prickly Pear Vinaigrette dressing. Perfect proportion of dressing to salad!  For dinner, my mom and I split the special, which was Grouper with a peach and cilantro salsa, on a big bed of Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Our bill total came to about $75, and Lon's was definitely the right choice. SO GOOD!",

Did not feel like we were even in Phoenix.  To add to the evening the food was the best I've had in a long time.  Had the Hanger Steak on the server's recommendation and it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.    I don't think they seat in the Wine Cellar very often but request it when you make your reservation.",

My husband ordered off the regular menu because the entree he was interested in (on the prix-fix menu) was only 5-6 ounces of meat.  Not nearly enough meat for him. He ordered the double ribeye. I had the hangar steak on the prix-fix menu and it was good.  We both really loved the truffle fries that came with it.  The dessert wasn't very impressive.  Supposed to be apple cobbler, but it was WAY more 'cobbler' than apples and the scoop of ice cream was so small that they would have been better off drizzling cream over top so that you got some with every bite of  cobbler. It was nice, but there are a lot of other places as nice, if not more so. I would definitely try to get a table on the patio, if we went back.",

Unfortunately, we did not find any of the above.   We had reserved an outdoor table. When we showed up, the hostess looked down at our jeans and flip flops, then rolled her eyes. (We are from Seattle where nobody cares what you wear to dinner!) We were told it would be a 40 minute wait if we wanted to sit outside. We agreed to sit inside because we were hungry and we were thinking that it really doesn't matter where you sit if the food and service are great.   We were put into a back room with a loud foursome and 6 empty tables. So much for the romantic evening! The service was pathetically slow. Very nice wait staff, just slow. At one point we received our wine 10 minutes after the course showed up.   We ordered the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing. The wine was very average and the food was even less. The food was one dimensional in taste. The veal looked and tasted like duck! I would bet a lot of money that it was duck. My other half did not think it was veal or duck but couldn't identify what it was.   The wines were all very young which is OK if they were good. The desert wine was undrinkable. We justified the average wine selection due to the $35 price tag. You get what you pay for.   I just wish I had the same experience that the rest of the reviewers had. I was so disappointed that I felt compelled to join Yelp so that I could write a review!",

He has lived here 55 years and never had been here so we were both excited.  Upon arriving we loved the patio instantly.  The manager was very nice and made a great effort to get us a table outside since it was our first time. Unfortunately the service from that point forward failed.  Our waiter didn't introduce himself, tell us of any specials, recommend anything, and was very impersonal.. Then the lady bussing the tables reached right between us to remove our plates never asking if we were finished or saying excuse me.  This was a rather pricey meal and usually with that comes outstanding service.  We enjoyed the food the wine and the live music. We loved the patio atmosphere but with the service being so impersonal I am not sure we would return.  Perhaps we just were unlucky and caught our server on an off night.

The lovely Lauren, our waitress recommended it and said if I didn't like it it was on her and I could have the blueberry marscarpone cheesecake instead. Either way I was winning...didn't have to trade off. It was the right amount in a delightful not-too-sweet- chocolate cup. Yummmmm.   Oh so you want to know about dinner? I started with the Dungeness crab salad. Nice, light, interesting mix of flavors which I liked very much but left me feeling like something was missing. For dinner I had the seared ahi appetizer - I know, done everywhere but I really just felt like a small portion of nice fish. It was that. Again, good but no wow factor. Perfect for what I wanted but I wished it had more umph.   Service was great - it was a slow Monday. Wine list is a budget killer and a bit more manageable by the glass. We weren't rushed and overall a very nice experience and meal. I'd most certainly go back.   yeah, go.",

The drinks were flat and the deserts were equally inferior.  The patio ambiance was superior and the service fair to good.  Little value here, and the forced valet parking is a particular irritant.",
