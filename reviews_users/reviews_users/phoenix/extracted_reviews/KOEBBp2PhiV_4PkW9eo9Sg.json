I was only able to stomach a few bites, and that was all I could choke down. The rice was good,  the Greek salad was amazing. I won't be ordering the chicken again..and Im not sure if I would eat there again in general. 11.00 for a plate of dried out chicken, some rice, and a handful full of salad (although tasty a.f) was not really worth it to me.

I also add chicken to the hummus to make it even more flavorful. Definitely a must try!",

The service is friendly and attentive and the menu is quite appetizing to look at. Once you make your selection, you're given a table marker and told that your food will be brought right to you. I appreciate this, especially since getting my daughter in a high chair is now my top priority at this moment. When the food comes out, the portion size will surprise you (in a good way) and the taste will exceed any expectations you've had. I've been there twice this week and I'll be sure to become a regular at this delicious Greek joint.",

Someone comes around to collect plates and ask how the food is, and they seem genuinely curious if you enjoyed your meal.   Run to this place as fast as you can before even MORE people find out about it and you can't get a seat!!",

Probably because they were too busy eating delicious pitas.   I had the Grilled Eggplant Pita and for a vegetarian dish,  it was not lacking in flavor.",

The place was packed, I got a table almost immediately but every table was occupied (good sign). My food came out within a few minutes - I think the owner was helping food run, and was quick at the end to notice I needed a to-go box. The customer service was excellent and notable - really upped the experience. This casual restaurant is definitely worth a try.

I did like everything I tried though from the Spanakopita to the gyros. As far as costs I wouldn't say it's a great deal, but the prices are fair and about average.  One thing I really loved about this place was that they actually played unique ethnic music. It beats the annoying pop music that the majority of places play and really added something to the experience. It was very relaxing and enjoyable.

Avoid this place during lunch hour. Changed to 2 star rating.",

Greek fries are highly recommended, and the dressing that comes with them divine. Restaurant hummus doesn't usually impress me, but theirs is top notch! Creamy, smooth, with a hint of garlic. The meats were well marinaded and each had its own unique, distinctive flavor.  How to improve on perfection? Our entrees each came with a single pita bread. I might suggest offering two pitas with each meal. One was not enough and two would be just about right. Baklava was excellent. My husband - who is half Lebanese - remarked that it tastes just like his dad used to make.  And here's the kicker... Here you can get two large, homemade-quality meals for just about the same price as fast food. This is going to be my go-to place for picking up dinner on my way home from work. Bravo!",

FINALLY some place that serves really fresh and wonderful tasting food :) I had the falafel wrap combo with pita chips and hummus. I loved the flavors from the fresh greens and the hot falafels. For me, I need more of the sauce because I like my wraps a bit on the wet side. I wound up eating it all , no leftovers :(  My other half had the Shish Kabob platter with chicken and beef. Although he is not a fan of poultry  he found the chicken well seasoned, juicy and the marinade to be awesome. And the rice... he's not a carb fan but loved it!  We found everyone behind the counter very pleasant, helpful and cheerful. Lots of interesting food items that I need to try for sure! As one reviewer said \"Skip the burger and Go Greek\"! .....  Well, at least once and you won't regret it. We're just sorry we haven't been in before now but we definitely  will be back.. again .. and again! Thank You Pita Kitchen!!",

We started off with the crisp Greek salad that had yummy feta, tomatoes, onions and olives (next time I will ask for extra olives as it made the salad). Then our steak Shawarma and fries came out.. and was I ever happy to see it.  It was a large portion and packed with a flavorful steak that was not chewy in the least.  I can't say enough about this steak, you will just have to try it  The sauce was perfect and we did get a side of tzatziki sauce for sipping upon request.  The pita was soft and together with the steak, perfect!!  The fries were cooked with an amazing crisp and also had great flavor. FIVE STAR FOOD BABY.   It is nice inside and the service could not be better! It was all over a great meal and we will be returning many times in our future.  Make sure to check in you will get 10% off.",

    "text": "I love this place. The only problem is it can get overcrowded. I always order the chicken kabob meal w/ the cilantro hummus. Do yourself a favor order an extra pita bread & extra garlic sauce. If you're a mayo hater give the garlic sauce to someone else, they'll love you. One meal can maybe get you some leftovers. I personally prefer all the chicken dishes. The staff is always friendly & attentive. They keep up very well with the cleaning. If you have a craving for the yellow rice, the mahatma rice at Walmart is a good substitute. I will always pick this place over any other place in the area",

The owner is very friendly and pleasant when I have came across him. Good to see his business is thriving!   I will continue to be a regular costumer, you will leave here satisfied!",

Hands down our most favorite place to dine. But, then....... something changed. A change for the worst. Shwarmas are dry, hummus is all botched and mixed together. Appetizer tabouli is no longer fresh and flavorful. We're both so disappointed. My husband was recovering from stage 4 esophagus cancer and this was one place he'd still crave. Not anymore. Cold & Stale meals now. Slimy soggy cucumbers, even pitas took a turn for the worse. Did you change owners or what???? What a bummer. Thinking maybe it was a fluke. We tried a few more times but nope huge change. Not even the same seasoning or style since around January 2017..........",

The sides were good, but I wish they offered Greek lemon-roasted potatoes. But that's neither here nor there. I'll probably be back when I'm really itching for Greek food and can't make it to my favorite spot.",

We both got the gyro one with pita and hummus and the other with the Greek fries(?). The hummus is good, I have only ever had hummus at pita jungle. Their hummus was much different but very tasty. The fries though! They were absolutely delicious. The gyro came in a warm pita, and the meat was hot and topped with tomatoes, onions and their fantastic tzatiki(?). I think the thing that upset me most about eating here was not having enough room in my stomach to eat every last bite.   The staff is very polite, and the food is amazing. This place is now one of my  go-to places.",

Whatever dish you get here, trust me, get some of this magic pink garlic sauce - you won't regret it. Apart from that I usually get the beef or chicken. I'd vote this place second best Greek in Phoenix, with Greek Wraps coming out well in in front like they always do.

This is a little hole in the wall on the corner of 99th and McDowell (same plaza as Hobby Lobby) but located in the smaller strip of stores at the other end of the parking lot. Looks to be run by 2, maybe 3 guys. I've eaten my fair share of Middle Eastern food and this is some of the best I've had in Phoenix. The garlic sauce is awesome. I can't even guess what's in it but I'm sure unicorn blood is involved.   I had the steak schwarma and hummus and hubby had the chicken souvlaki. His chicken was so perfectly cooked that we couldn't decide if it was white or dark meat. It had the flavor of white meat but was moist like dark meat. The hummus was delicious and it had a bit of a kick but it wasn't overly spicy or anything. It was all delicious and came with generous amounts of pita bread for dipping. Prices were reasonable for the portion sizes and the Yelp check in bonus was a 10% discount off of the bill.  Service was super friendly and helpful and we will definitely be back. Well done gentlemen. Glad to have found you in the West Valley.",

So I was happy to take a bite of a well done falafel on the West Side of town (which is devoid of ethnic cuisine past Mexican food). My hubs had the gyro & really enjoyed the freshness of all the ingredients & tasty meats. He ordered the hummus & pita chips as well & the hummus was really good. So for all of these reasons I'm going with an A-OK review. The cons were the .59 cent charge for a small side of tzatziki sauce. I was like OK this had better knock my socks off tzatziki for .59. The service was really nice up at the front but slow to serve & had to ask for the tzatziki. When brought to me it was the sesame sauce which was bitter city that comes with the falafel vs what I ordered. Also not so hot the pita chips. I'd recommend not ordering the pita chips unless you're trying to maximize your grease intake. Not pleasant in the least so avoid, avoid, avoid the pita chips. Having said all of that it's a local chain & the gyros, falafel & hummus are yummy so give them a try.",

The lady told me they've been at this location for two years. I guess I've passed it up several times. I am always over here shopping at Old Navy and Justice for my youngest.   Now for the food. It smells delicious! It is enough for two people. It was a little salty for me but everything is salty since I've been pregnant. The rice was perfect with the exception of a few hard pieces but that happens everywhere.   The lady came out to check on me. I'm now starting to think that she is the owner. I couldn't eat it all. I felt bad because I was wasting food. Nevertheless I will return. I'm interested in tasting the other items on the menu. I'm anxious to try the humus. I love a good humus.",

I always passed by Pita kitchen on my way to run errands or eat elsewhere. Today that changed and i was finally tempted enough to try it. The magical aroma that filled the cozy restaurant. And the staff and service were excellent! Ana and Diana made sure i and my mom were taken care of. From observing the other tables they looked like the other people came here often and even held conversations with the customers ourselves included that were very happy with the service. I ordered the Cilantro hummus and the number 12 plate that came with 2 meat portions of your choice  and a delicious rice and greek salad. The hummus was without a doubt the best hummus i ever had in my life and I'm a Hummus snob. The portions were generous the food including the salad was fresh. The meat perfectly seasoned and piping hot. It looks like the heart,passion and flare stayed in this place. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you for your service!",

I absolutely will only go someplace more than once if I deem it worthy and only Yelp places that are worth spending your money on.  That being said this place is phenomenal!  The owners treat every guest as family and I have yet to eat anything short of perfection.  My wife and I eat here or take out from here on a monthly basis of not sometimes twice in a month.  I highly recommend the steak shawarma and my wife is a big fan of the gyros!  There pita chips are AMAZINGLY and their Greek fries have left me dying for more on many occasions.  The restaurant is always immaculate even in their busiest of times and their staff is always friendly.  For an added treat don't forget to order a baklava.  It's doubtful you'll have room for it at dinner, but it's a great pick me up with an evening coffee after you blissful food coma wears off!",

The meat on my gyro was warm but was not seared crispy. The tzatziki was bland, little onions/tomato, and the pita bread was falling apart. The chicken shwarma was dry but had some flavor. Greek fries were good but was thrown off by the serving bowl it came in. I swear they stole the bowls  from Ghenghis Grill.",

This place is in a plaza with Chipotle and Raising cane's so I'm sure they get a lot of business from people who don't want to wait in line, but I'm sure these customers are pleasantly surprised to have stumbled upon such a gem. The food was amazing. I just had the gyro and greek fries. The gyro was large and delicious. Pita was fluffy and so perfectly made. The fries were out of this planet. I've never had greek fries with feta, parsley and olive oil on them. It was divine. My friend texts me weekly to go back.   When I ordered here, we noticed you can text a number to get a discount off your meal. They honored the discount and when the cashier realized he overcharged me ( 2 minutes after I already paid), he tracked me down to give me the difference that he owed me. I didn't even notice the error, but it's this kind of honesty that will keep me coming back. The delicious food helps too!",

    "text": "Despite being casual, Pita Kitchen is a great little restaurant that can go toe-to-toe with much more expensive Mediterranean restaurants.   I can get an edible gyro anywhere, but this represents a clear delineation between Greek, however well-meaning, that tastes like fast food stuffed with lunch meat, and True food that leaves you satisfied in the sense you've consumed something real. For the first time in a while, it actually tasted like I was ravenously stuffing my face with fresh lamb and robust tzatziki. I upgraded to Greek Fries, which were well-seasoned and crunchy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside, as the ideal fry should be. They were topped with freshly diced Feta--not the cheap crumbles, and drizzled with a nice citrus-based sauce that enhanced and complemented the other flavors.   It was only 10 dollars and some change, and was undoubtedly worth much more.  Vegetarians can also feel confident in an opportunity to indulge in a fine meal as well. I've tried the eggplant pita--and it was nothing short of a refreshing change of pace that wouldn't leave my more carnivorous readers wanting more. While the pita chips I had these with were fried, which I found odd, the generous helping of them proved a match made in heaven with above-average cilantro hummus. It boasted a medley of spices rather than the regrettable loads of salt to keep diners hooked.   I dare declare Pita Kitchen as the best Greek one can find in the West Valley, but if it's out of your way, just know it's totally worth!",

I can say that from the moment you walk in, you are greeted with excellent customer service. This place could easily be just any typical Mediterranean place, but what makes it better than average is the friendliness and genuine care the staff shows you right off the bat. I ordered the Greek Salad w/Gyro meat. While it wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, it definitely wasn't the worst. Their tea options are also pretty awesome so skip the soda and go for the more delicious and healthier option!  Still not convinced on the customer service? This is a place where you walk to the front and order and they bring the food to your table. The employee that took my order came over when I was done just to ask how everything was and for feedback if there was anything better they could have done to enhance my experience. For that alone, I will be coming back if I find myself in WV again!",

The garlic sauce is awesome and the hummus was full of flavor but not spicy! Everything tasted very fresh! We will go again if we are back in the area in the future. Also got 10% off for checking in on Yelp!",

My only complaint previously was the tap water. It was awful, BUT it's been fixed, and now the water is filtered and tastes just fine.   I ventured out and tried something new on the menu: the chicken shawarma plate, and I'm glad I did. It was fantastic, and filling, and worth it's price. The cilantro hummus it comes with is excellent as well. I think I found a new favorite item. I'll continue to drop in the Pita Kitchen from time to time.",

Parking is shared with other businesses so you might have to drive around the lot to look for a spot during peak times.  Business is clean, and staff extremely friendly and welcoming.  The place is a bit small, and when we arrived, all the tables were occupied.  There were only a couple of outside tables and those too were occupied (-1). We decided to turn our in-dining experience to a take away experience, but luckily, a table opened up prior to ordering.  The food was great and adequately portioned - very filling and tasty.  I had the steak pita with the side of vegetable medley.   The pita was warm and tasty.  The steak was moist and cooked just right enough to not be too soft or too chewy. The vegetable medley was seasoned just right with the vegetables being cooked perfectly -- not too soggy, but crunchy enough.  Will be back either to dine or to take advantage of their online ordering and pickup!",

The dressing for the salad is my favorite, the tazziki is and will be the best, the Pita is soooo warm and fluffy and the meat is always the best with a char on it.

    "text": "I have now been to Pita Kitchen twice this week, I suppose that in itself says something.  Checked out this place for the first time when I went with a friend of mine on Tuesday, we went less than an hour before closing and still received very prompt and exceptionally courteous service....very awesome.    Said friend and I both got the Gyro pita, generous portion and very fresh pita, it was definitely tasty.  The meat was tender.  Also inside the pita is tomatoes, onions, and taziki.  The onions could be a bit thinner in cut as it was mostly thick slices.  And the taziki which they are VERY generous with, is a little thinner than I am used to.   Went again today with my mom, she loves Spanakopita, so was excited to find it on the menu.  It is listed as an appetizer, so I figured it to be small, and it was, but for the price of less than $3 it was still a good deal.  Again, I had the gyro and it was right on with Tuesdays visit.  *Note to self: order gyro with taziki on side next time, they are SUPER generous with it!  I don't know how the rest of the sides are, but they are generous with the fry portion, making the combo a very filling meal.  The regular fries are fine, pretty typical shoestring.  The greek fries are not as addictive as they are at My Big Fat with their lemon sauce.  However, they are still tasty.  They come with extra seasoning, some oregano and feta crumbles.  Sprinkle a little lemon on it and they are lovely.  What truly stands out at this place is the service.  These people are genuinely gracious and appreciative to the customers coming in their restaurant.  I don't know if it is just the first week excitement, or if this is how it will always be, but the welcoming demeanor of this place I have seen so far, on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back.  Welcome to the area Pita Kitchen, and thank you for bringing something new to this neighborhood in desperate need of variety and choices!",

The Gyro's are not too salty like other places, bread is soft and the Tzatziki sauce is on point. The Greek fries are a must have and a great addition to any meal. Girlfriend always gets the hummus trio and adds chicken which I always steal as much as I can get my hands on because it is so good. Another reason that I love going here is they have the option to get any bread in whole wheat, which is a nice healthy change from other Greek places.",

The ice tea is better than the ice tea at Pita Jungle. I never go to Pita Jungle anymore. You guys get 5 stars for being so much better than a popular chain. I also love supporting small businesses, being a business owner myself.  They need to get better at being busy, because with food this good... they will be constantly busy. We ordered food to go tonight. It was good but not great like it usually is. They were PACKED, so our meal probably got rushed a bit. I think they are out growing that little spot. Time to buy the hawaiian place next door that is always empty and move in next to Chipotle.  1 good meal, many many great meals. Still a 5 star place in my opinion!",

There service is amazing they're always smiling and making you feel welcomed and there food OMG there food beats the service which is impossible to comprehend but it does!!! I lve tried a few different items and have always left satisfied today however I went in with a different mindset as in I needed some comfort food. This is where Pita Kitchen excels, I ordered the gyros entree and Greek bruschetta, first time for the latter which came out 1st and I'm so glad it did because it was one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered in any food establishment in a very long time. Soon after the entree showed up and like I said I've had it many times before but that didn't matter because it tasted like the very first time again which needless to say is pretty epic. I could write a novel and not do this gem of a place  justice so I'll leave with the tip that if you love amazing food and great service it doesn't matter what part of the valley you are in, it is definitely worth the drive and some.",

I let her know I will modify where I go to eat and no longer come here. My friend ordered her sandwich with avocado $1.50 extra, when it came out they told her they ran out of avocado no refund offered. She had to go up to the front for her refund.

We spent the weekend at Phoenix Comicon and were preparing to drive back to Las Vegas when we discovered that the 115 degree heat had killed our car battery! After getting a jump from the helpful Radisson hotel staff, we drove to the nearest Sam's Club with an automotive department. Thanks to Yelp, we found that this place was close by so we decided to eat before hitting the road. Initially we were disappointed because the restaurant is crammed into a strip mall and it was very crowded. It didn't appear to be anything special but I'm glad we stayed. This was some of the best Greek food I've had in a while! One really nice touch is that you can get pita chips and hummus instead of fries with your meal and the hummus is very good. The prices are a little higher than normal but the quality and quantity of food more than makes up for it. This place is worth checking out if you are in the area.",

Even my super picky husband loves it here and it's always his first choice. The cook in the back is always friendly and the lady in front always asks us how our meal as. all of their staff has been friendly and we have never had bad service or bad food. I just wish they could get a nother location or a larger location because lunch time is grinding time!! Always busy and yummy I wonder how they don't run out of food!!! Perfection!",

The feta cheese on the salad was by far the best I've had. Usually, I just sort of deal with feta on my salad, but this was really tasty. Nice and salty without the odd bitter blue cheese notes of most feta. The food came out quickly, and the staff are all very nice. I found myself in tolleson by accident and yelp led me here. I would be back if I'm ever in the area again, but I'm sad to say that the drivers in the area of tolleson are nincompoops. The restaurant itself is small but clean and I had no problem finding a seat. Try them out if you're in the area and don't mind dealing with insane traffic.",

When I walked in, the place was buzzing. In fact, every table was filled but fortunately, one group was waiting for a to-go order so my colleague grabbed their table.  It's a walk-up order situation. A super friendly smiling woman helped advise our order. She was hyper knowledgeable about the menu. My colleague ordered a Gyro with hummus and I got the mediterranean salad with chicken. We also got a side of jalapeno cilantro hummus. Wow! This hummus is flat out delicious and all servings were generous. We were served in a very timely manner, loved the food and will definitely go back when in the area.",

I've been here a few times and every time it's messed up. The food is ok, not the best. I feel 1 star is a bit harsh for messed up food so I suppose 2 will do. I'm not one to complain to the people who make your food so I just bite my tongue, and accept it as a loss.

The owner or manger was too busy having sushi with his girl to manage the kitchen 4 groups after us were served their food before it's was and the server didn't know what table got what food.

Tender, loaded with seasoning, not dry at all. The rice made for a delicious bed for the chicken. I'm a total salad snob, and I loved the Greek salad. Great mix of flavors and I liked that it took up half the plate. Good, healthy eats!  Then there was the pita bread. I have never eaten fresh pita bread before! I think of pita bread as the thick, stiff stuff from grocery stores. No more. THIS is good bread. Warm, pliable, and delicious.  My husband had the steak shawarma entree. He loved it. The piece of his tri-tip that I grabbed was quite tasty. He had the fries instead of the salad and said they were average fries, which was just fine by him.  The woman at the counter was very helpful as we took our orders--we were obviously newbies. Our food came out within about ten minutes, which said something considering almost every table was full that Friday evening. We also watched a steady stream of customers getting take-out orders. Once we had the food, we understood why.",

    "text": "Understand that for me to give something five stars the experience has to be flawless and though I'm not giving Pita Kitchen five stars it's as close to five I can give without pulling the trigger!   To start there is a fair amount of seating and the place was extremely clean including the restrooms. They take great pride in the cleanliness of the eating space but a glance into the kitchen proved the care was for every space.   Drinks were coke products and teas. I love Coke Zero but went with the fresh brewed tea and what really impressed me were the fresh cut lemons. This might seem trivial but I respect attention to detail. In any Mediterranean eatery you can't mess up the hummus and Pita Kitchen does not. Smooth and full of taste the hummus was obviously made by someone who knows what they are doing.   Now the food: we ordered appetizer hummus, lamb gyro, and chicken shawarma (the #4 on the menu). The portion size was huge and included A LOT of meat. Transitioning into the source of the four star justification comes from, admittedly nit picky, the meat being a bit dry for my liking which also took away from it being tender.   Again admittedly, gyros and shawarma should be meat heavy. Having said that, some more vegetables and sauce could have masked the meat just a bit more. The pita however was great and not to thick or thin.   Overall my impression was for a great change of pace from burgers and pizza this is a solid option with no disappointments. We will be back to try some of the plated meals next! Nice find in the West Valley!",

It was about $11. The pita was overflowing! 99% meat. The fries were DELICIOUS. Hot, crispy, seasoned perfectly, and with chunks of greek cheese. No wonder the girl told me they were called \"Crack Fries\". I will have to agree with this name. I dream about these fries. I wish this was closer to me; I would be a regular here.   The service was very quick. The restaurant was very clean. The amount of food and the taste given matches the price.   Oh, and i LOVED that they didn't charge me more for extra sauce!!

Very dissatisfying experience there.

It was a bit of a hard sell as my father claimed to not like Greek food. After I told him he could get steak and fries he reluctantly agreed. Upon arrival, we were both greeted by the nicest staff member. She was outgoing, helpful, funny, and above all, a great start to our lunch experience.   So as mentioned, my father and I both got the Steak Shawarma Pita with fries. The pita was full of steak that was tender and juicy. The sauce inside the pita was on point. For the fries, they were crunchy and flavorful. Overall, a killer meal, especially for the price.  Lastly, my father was so happy with his meal that he agreed to try some baklava for dessert and again, the food was on point.  And I don't even like baklava.  I will be back to Pita Kitchen again for sure and bring more family with me.   Five star lunch spot!!!!!",

I ordered the #12 (two meat entre) with chicken kabob and beef shawarma. Food was on point very generous portions, The shawarma was a little over done for my taste but the flavor was amazing which saved the day. The salad was as authentic as it gets with big chunks of feta and legit Greek olives. Also had the jallepeno hummus and it too was awesome. The staff were super sweet as well. I come from the LA area where good Mediterranean reigns supreme and I would stack this place with any of the best I've had in LA. Definitely worth the 15 min drive o will be back next time I'm in town!",

We can usually get out of there with 2 dinners and a app. for under 35 dollars so the price point is less than some of the competing Greek joints in the Goodyear / Avondale area. This seems like a family run joint and the service has always been fantastic and I always feel super welcome when I'm here. I have had no issues with absurd waiting or problems with my order. This is a great joint on our side of town and I would suggest it to my Yelp buddies.",

The meat had so much flavor and wasn't dry at all. The gyro was so large my fiancee ended up eating half and he loved it. It was his first time ever eating one and he is looking forward to going back. Friendly staff and great food make this a wonderful place to eat! My only gripe is that the Baklava was possibly the worst I've ever had. It was extremely salty and just terrible. Skip the desserts!",

I ordered the Chicken Shawarma to go and was super excited to dive in, but there was one major thing missing. I had asked for the sauce to be on the side and instead there was no sauce whatsoever. I could tell the chicken was well-marinated, but without any sauce, it just was not the same. I was already too far from the restaurant to go back and ask for a side so it was a little bit of a let down to eat a somewhat dry pita. The chicken comes in a hefty portion which I can appreciate, but the lettuce/tomato portion was pretty minute compared to the overall portion of the chicken. I am sure the pita would have been delicious with the sauce, I just wish it hadn't been forgotten in my order.",

    "text": "Long time eater, second time Yelper! I can honestly say that this is by far one of my go to restaurants. It just so happens that its not far from my house, which is highly convenient because if I want high quality, tasty, healthy food, in large portions, I have to look no further then a few miles away.   I'll answer the burning questions: Yes and Yes.    Yes its worth any wait you may encounter. They sometimes get pretty busy because if you glance through these reviews, most people love the food! These meals are not some flimsy fast food concoction. These are culinary presentations! Both in taste and in look. Worth the wait!   Yes the prices have gone up and yes the food is worth every penny. Those of us loyal customers that have come in for years know this and we still go. Lucky for us that we were able to get such excellent food for cheap prices!  My recommendation is the steak shawarma. It has amazing spices and is usually prepared perfectly. I like to pair it with the original hummus. Usually when I order this dish with my family, the plate is completely clean. The dip usually goes to my daughter who absolutely loves it.   I'd like to add that the staff here is amazing. If I ever have a problem or feel the food is off, I let them know and they fix it. Since they treat me right, I have yet to have a bad experience.  Pita Kitchen is a hidden gem for the west side of town. It is right up there with some of the other more expensive mediterranean places I also like to frequent that are more expensive. If you like this type of food, you have to visit!",

This time around that I visited I placed my order through the phone. The cashier was nice and welcoming. I ordered the kabob plate with cilantro hummus and rice. I come home to find out that my pita bread wasn't with my order. I was a bit bummed but still proceeded with my food. The chicken kabob was amazing as I've always remembered. I tried the cilantro jalapeno hummus and it wasn't my favorite I'd just stick with the regular hummus. Sadly to say the  rice wasn't there at all I'm not sure if they switched up the ingredient or what but I didn't like it this time around.",

    "text": "Before you read my review, you should know this about me:  1. I'm a southern Californian born in Taiwan. 2. I've lived in north Orange County all my life minus the four years I spent in UT for college. 3. I love to eat, and refuse to eat anything I don't think taste good.  REFUSE. 4. I don't mind spending money to eat well. 5. My parents owned two sandwich shops while I was growing up.  I worked there as a kid, through college and beyond, so I'm a big fan of mom and pop shops.  I am a HUGE fan of Mediterranean food done RIGHT, and this is THE spot.  In all my travels, this is the best Mediterranean food place I've ever had HANDS DOWN. I swore I would come back and eat here again on my way back to CA, but I did not have a chance to, and let's just say it's my biggest regrets on this trip.  What we had (for two people who were starving but didn't want to overstuff ourselves or overspend):  Lentil soup, regular beef plate, eggrolls, babaganush: everything was TASTY!!!!  I put more details on the captions of each picture.  I seriously cannot wait to go back and try what else they have to offer.  It's THAT good. I will definitely return every time I visit Arizona.  My only complaint, literally ONLY complaint, was how difficult to find this place.  What the heck!?!?!?!  Our Google Map had a very difficult time locating this place, which is snuggled in between LOTS of different stores at this shopping center. It was hard for this vision-challenged out of towner! So I took a picture of the place outside just in case anyone who is trying to find it had a hard time finding it like I did.",

It's a small little mom and pop type place where you order at the register and they bring your food out to you. It was definitely busy on a Saturday night with limited seating inside, but they do offer take out as well.   The wait was pretty slow to get our food, but the food was 100% worth the wait. I had the Chicken Shawarma Pita with a side of hummus and pita chips. The portion was HUGE. We ended up sharing most of the pita chips & hummus. The Chicken Shawarma, OMG, so freaking good! I don't know what kind of spices they use, but that's some of the best chicken I've ever had.   I will be sure to come back here next time I'm in town. I highly recommend this place for some good quality greek food.",

They have so many delicious Mediterranean options! One of their most popular dishes is their Greek Fries- which we will most definitely have to come back to try!  In the mood for something a little on the healthier side, I ordered the Chicken Shwarma plate with a side Greek salad (hummus could have been a substitute). The portion was so wonderful and plentiful for the price! The chicken was flavorful and the rice was wonderful. The salad was great too! Honestly one of the best parts, was the garlic sauce that was served with the Chicken! Where are all my garlic lovers?! Go get yourself some of this delectable sauce- I put it on my chicken and rice-this stuff is a total game changer, delicious!  The staff was friendly, the place was nice and clean, and we had a wonderful decently healthy meal- a win all around! Give it a try if you're in the area",

    "text": "Recently, my hockey buddy and I discovered the Pita Kitchen nearby. Frequently, when he and I are craving some Mediterranean fare, we end up at another restaurant at Westgate. We were eager to try this place out because it happens to be closer to home. Interestingly, we chose take out for this visit.  Pita Kitchen has a nice atmosphere and it's casual, but appropriately themed. It certainly doesn't feel cheap. But the prices are. That's impressive because of all the Greek food I've ever enjoyed, I've never complained about the price. The menu has lots of photos for reference and everything looks delicious.  We both enjoyed our dinners and thought the flavors were really good. I particularly liked the Greek Salad too. And while our portions seemed generous for the price, it seems we each received a very generous portion of rice. Not that the rice was bad. But it was apparent the savings are at the expense of the proteins.  My Gyro Entree was seasoned well, but there wasn't as much beef/lamb as I've come to expect at other establishments. Honestly, the place I'm thinking of has a Gyro meat appetizer that is more generous. Regardless, the service was pleasant. We will probably be back if only to enjoy a dine in experience.",

The problem is that they didn't put much ingredients inside of it besides that. Skimpy on the tomatoes, skimpy on the sauce and skimpy on the onions.  The only thing that this place has going for itIs the taste of the food. Customer service skills could be enhanced through training. But not too many places train their people in customer service skills anymore. That's sad!

Once I got home with my orders I was eager to try the egg rolls, I was very disappointed. Issue: they looked as if they were doubled fried, soggy, very bland taste just horrible and the rice was bland/dry. I put the egg rolls away for return the next day. The falafel was okay so I ate it the next day. Upon my return the same rude host attempted to argue with me about the return! I simply wanted a refund her respond was \"we can make you a new order.\"   I told her no because I didn't like the taste at all. I will not be eating at this restaurant again!

But as long as I can get the Greek fries and some grilled veggies I'm good. It is tuff to get a party of more than 5 there but we made it work. The food is great. I have not had anything there I did not like. The desserts are average. Do not expect anything amazing.",

The food is excellent, healthy, and flavorful. There are many vegan options. The tabouli salad has great flavor. The fattoush salad is also very good. I love the eggplant gyro--I was skeptical at first about how the eggplant would taste, but the way it is made, it has so much flavor and a great texture. The falafel gyro is great, as well. Another favorite of mine is the mediterranean sampler, which consists of hummus, pita bread, dolmas, and falafel. Their pita chips are wonderful. I also recommend the Greek fries, of which I have them leave off the cheese for me.",

This is a warning to all who want to use <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.com&s=2044a80cf48ab01cdacc4f61b89372824aae4524db1be143cba20120239d6862\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">entertainment.com</a> coupons to buy one meal and get one free.  We have several entertainment books which gives us one online coupon per each purchased book.  We printed one coupon and immediately went to location for lunch.  Lady at counter called redemption phone # and told me it was not a valid coupon/#, meaning it had been redeemed. I showed her that it had just been printed and she insisted it was no good.  I got coupon back and I called the phone # on coupon and I was told it was a valid coupon/#.  I got back in line and told her such.  She then said she would call again and put it on speaker.  I told her \"of course it won't be valid now, because I just called and redeemed it.\"  And just like I said the recording said, \"this is not a valid #\".  So bottom line is, either she really didn't call the redemption phone # originally and lied to me or she doesn't know how to redeem coupons and doesn't follow the prompts correctly to redeem the coupons or punches in the wrong coupon redemption #.  We left and I used another coupon in Entertainment book and we went a couple of miles to Dysart Road and ate 2 for 1 at Greek Gyro Express where the food is just as great and you get free soups....chicken rice and lentil.  We won't be back to Pita Kitchen, as I can't trust them anymore.  I will miss the good food, but there are many other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in our area that are just as good or better and they always honor our coupons.  I now feel they are running a scam, now using the coupons as BAIT and hoping you will stay there even when you are told the coupon is not valid.  We don't play that game with establishments that do business in a questionable manner.",

    "text": "FINALLY! A Greek/Mediterranean place that has great food, friendly owners and above all is on the WEST SIDE OF TOWN!  This place was a bit hard to find since we are not familiar with the area. It is located in a strip mall on the southwest corner of 99th and McDowell.  My wife is more of a Hummus fan than I am.  It's how she gauges a restaurant, well this was a different Hummus altogether.  It isn't exactly a spicy heat but there is a spice/seasoned kick to it so if you're not use to that then take it slow. Their Hummus is dotted with Mediterranean spices with a drizzling of olive oil and sprinkling of paprika and their pita is soft and warm. This is awesomeness on a plate!  Just as she gauges a restaurant by their Hummus, I gauge it by their Gyro meat.  I ordered the Gyro platter ($8.99) and it came with a perfectly seasoned beef and lamb that was also served with pita, Taziki and your choice of a salad or Hummus...go for the Hummus.  If you do, then you can save a little by not ordering the Hummus appetizer.  Oh and the Gyro rests on a bed of wonderful basmati rice.  This meal is substantial!  Their portions are generous to say the least. We also ordered the Greek Fries which are French fries that are sprinkled with feta cheese, parsley, and usually olive oil, but I think there was not only olive oil but also an acidic component which added another layer of flavor.   Next time I go I am going to try the Calamari and Grilled Eggplant wrap.  The Grilled Eggplant wrap is ($6.49) and has grilled slices of eggplant, grilled Italian squash and grilled green peppers & onions with romaine lettuce, tomatoes and your choice of marinara sauce or taziki sauce.  Any choices can be made into a combo too.  So will my wife and I go again? Absolutely!",

    "text": "This place is GOOD, all caps. The restaurant is clean, service is great and the food is the bees knees. My husband and I ordered the hummus and tabbouleh, beef gyro with fries, chicken schwarma, a side of rice for our son (he's a toddler) and baklava. Let me point out that my husband and I were both stationed in Turkey (It's where we met, Awww) so were a bit picky when it comes to Mediterranean food and this place passed. The gyro was perfectly seasoned, salty, crunchy, saucy all warmly wrapped in pita bread. The chicken schwarma was the same, the chicken was juicy with just the right about of vegetables and sauce (I added siracha because I love spicy and they offer it). I'd been reading about the delicious fries and the ones my husband got were plain, when I asked about the feta that was supposed to smother them I was told I had to order Greek fries. Even though it was my fault for ordering wrong the owner gave us a free order of Greek fries and they, are, addicting. The tabbouleh was just as citrusy as I remember from turkey. The only reason I didn't go with 5 stars is that the hummus is kind of bland and the baklava, although delicious, wasn't the crispy, pistachioy goodness I was craving. Overall this place is great.  If you have any issues remember that this place has only been open 2 weeks and they are doing an amazing job. Chok guzel!",

I always get the food to go, so I can't comment much on the service, but the worker at ordering is always super friendly, even with my weird order of separating everything.(Sometimes there is too much sauce and the pita gets soggy on To Go orders)  The only thing I've ordered so far is the Chicken Shawarma combo with Pita chips and hummus. But that's because it's just so good I can't get myself to order something else because I always crave it.",

Most importantly, their food was  really good.  I ordered a combo kebab and a \"spanakopita\" and both were really delish!  The pita here is nice a warm, and the meat was flavorful and juicy.  The spanakopita had a great flaky crusty.  I really loved the sauces here too, the garlic sauce was an excellent addirion ro the kebab.  I also have to give major props for the service.

I always order the chicken kabob Greek salad with the chicken chopped to avoid undercooked chicken yet the chicken has been pink on many occasions. In my last salad the \"hand chopped\" tomatoes were too large.  Literally, a whole tomatoe was cut into 4 pieces. The cucumbers were old transparent and soggy and there was not much lettuce. I also ordered the large hummus which was of a pudding consistency with too much lemon added.  And i usually get 2 pita breads with my order and today i got 4, all with yellow spots..perhaps they add butter now? I called to inform them of my unsatisfied order and was interrupted while I was going over what was wrong. Only redeeming factor was their offer to remake my food but after having it made so many times with unsafe chicken I could not accept that as a solution. I don't know if they changed cooks but everything was prepared different today. I liked coming here knowing I could eat a healthy meal when I was crunched on time but now it seems that is not the case anymore.  Next time I want Greek food I will go to 59th ave and olive.",

I was a little apprehensive spending $9 (8.69) on a Greek salad with chicken but told myself it would be huge and I would have to eat it over 2 sittings.  I was NOT disappointed.  There is a huge heap of chicken in this salad and it's not just a grilled chicken breast chopped over a Greek salad;  it's chicken SHAWARMA - beautifully seasoned, tender and moist.  There were chunks of feta as opposed to just tiny crumbles and their dressing was amazing!  My brother and I butt heads over Greek salad dressing;  he prefers to have it with vinegar strong enough to clean your pipes, and his go to is George's Gyros.  I prefer a more mellow dressing that allows me to keep my eyes open whilst eating and have come to frequent Z's Greek, down the road from my house.  This dressing was by far the BEST I've had.  I will definitely be back!",

Live in Chandler but took our friend to dinner here who lives in Avondale after reading the really good Yelp reviews. He's a picky eater, had never eaten Mediterranean before but loved it. He had the Gyro plate with rice and Greek salad. We ordered the Mediterranean sampler platter for an appetizer and it was fabulous. Comes with hummus, baba ghanouj, taziki dip, dolmas, falafel, tabbouli and pita bread. All very fresh and mouth-watering. The pita bread was very soft and warm. The baba ghanouj is out of this world -- smokey, nutty, spicy. I have never been a huge dolma fan, but I was finally won over here. Husband and I had the falafel pita. The falafel was well seasoned and moist, perfect. Hubby also had the Greek fries which put all other fries to shame. I had a few bites and wanted to snag them when he wasn't looking but decided to mind my manners so I didn't end up sleeping on the couch. :-0 The portions are good size with reasonable prices. Very courteous staff who greet you with a pleasant smile and check on you even though it's a counter order style restaurant. Very clean with nice ambiance for a small, fast food restaurant even though I don't put it in the same category as fast food. We will definitely make the near-hour trip again just to eat here...oh and to visit our friend. Tried to convince the owner to put their next location near Chandler. Maybe we will have to start a petition for that. Haha! At any rate, highly recommend giving it a try. Works well as a family restaurant (kid-friendly menu), dinner dates, for vegitarians/vegans, take-out or catering. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. Just might have to make the drive to Avondale today. Nom Nom!",

It's not fancy, but it's the best food and you definitely get more than you pay for. Pay at the counter and take a seat with your number.

The fries were hot and fresh, but somehow there was even less gyro meet this go around. Nevertheless, everything had a great flavor and was fresh.

I was greeted with a smile by the guy behind the counter.  The menu isn't big, but there is a good selection of Greek deliciousness.  I went with \"old faithful\" and had a gyro.  I decided on the hummus and pita chips as my side (you can choose from the hummus and pita chips or fries)  The hummus was good and the pita chips were very tasty.  Not too crunchy and not just warmed bread.    Now to the gyro.  Uh...\"I believe I ordered the LARGE cappuccino! HELLO!\" (If you get that movie reference give yourself a flying knuckle bump with a massive explosion at the end because YOU ROCK!  This thing was HUGE! Fully loaded (I chose no onions because...no me gusta raw onions) with tomatoes and a very flavorful tzatziki.  The pita bread was perfect and didn't fall apart as it has at other establishments.    Very worth the money and very close by!  I'll be frequenting this and now I have more to choose from on 99th and McDowell on my way home!",

I got my usual yummy order Chicken Shawarma with Greek Salad and you have to try their Greek Fries. My husband loves their Gyro Pita . Their food is always fresh you can really taste the goodness and love in everything they make. I will not go to any other Pita place in town except to Pita Kitchen. Maybe I am loyal or maybe it's cuz their food is just that good. I also love their vegetarian choices also, that is always a hit with me of course since I LOVE Vegetarian food. Thanks guys for always make us feel like family who feed us with awesome and yummy food. See you soon, Mac",

    "text": "I went to Pita Kitchen a few weeks ago, and was very excited to get some decent hummus nearby. The staff was friendly, and seemed to know their menu pretty well.  I ordered a the Chicken Shawarma with hummus. They accidentally messed up my order and gave me a greek salad. I'm not really one to complain, but I was really craving some hummus. I let the staff know, and they apologized and let me keep the salad as they prepped my hummus.  The chef came out and apologized again, then late came out a few minute later to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I was very impressed with their customer service and how professional they were. It was as we were getting fine dining customer service in a fast food style restaurant.   Overall, the food was great, and the customer service made it that much better. I will definitely be coming by more often!",

Not only was the customer service exceptional but their food was very good as well.   My friend and I had the Steak Shawarma with fries, Hummus with Steak Shawarma and Tabouli Salad.  Everything was very tasty with a homemade flavor.  The Pita bread that came with the Hummus was warm and soft which I love.  Everything looked just like the pictures on the menu so there were no surprises other than the delicious flavor. :)  We upgraded our dish to the combo so we ordered fries (option we chose, which were really good too) and had unlimited refills with any drink at the fountain!      Being that it was a grand opening week they handled the amount of people and orders in a timely manner.  The restaurant was very clean, as well as the women restrooms, which is important to me.    I highly recommend anyone to go and try it and enjoy the experience we did.  Again, delicious food and really great and friendly customer service!",

There were people hanging out waiting for to go orders.   We ordered a gyro combo each and pita and hummus.  So the hummus was very good and the pitas are very good.  The gyro meat was a little dry and crispy on some of the ends.  The fries were fries.  Nothing gross but nothing special.  The price although not very high I felt could be a little less expensive.  However, we did leave very full.  I was kind of digging the mediterranean music that was playing in the place.  I think we would try it again.  The service was very friendly.",

My boyfriend and I have ordered just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappoints. The Mediterranean sampler is a steal at $4.25 during happy hour. (They don't seem to advertise their happy hour, but I've been given 50% discounts for appetizers on a few occasions.) Their sauces and marinades are incredible. Be sure to try the cilantro jalapeno hummus and the chipotle sauce.",

The reddish/pink dipping sauce is addictive. And the rice tastes great. I do kind of wish that the shwarma wraps had a sour pickle in them but that is probably just a personal preference.  I'd recommend this to anyone that wants casual Mediterranean food in the west valley.",

The hummus is really good not sure if the pita is made there or if they buy it pre-made but it's good I always feel like you can't have enough.   If want to play it safe and try a little bit of the best just order the Combo Kabob entree, and get the hummus instead of the Greek salad. You'll thank me later. I don't know if I should be reviewing the gyros since I'm not a very big fan. The first time I was there I had Chicken Shawarma pita, it was really good, but I'm not a big fan. So I've never had them again not saying it's bad or anything.   The owners are also friendly the man which I think is the owner is always very polite and is whiling to explain anything. It seems to be family owned which is nice to still see.",

    "text": "A mixed feeling about this place.  Short Answer: It's a great place to have lunch if you are craving for Greek food whether you are dining in or taking out. But at night, it can be somewhat lackluster.  Long Answer: Me and my cousins went here to try out their Greek food because it was the closes one to our house and it has high rating. The first couple of times we went here was during lunch hours and close to evening time. Lunch hour is always crowded, but it wasn't long as you would expected to be. It's about 5 - 20 minutes wait depending on what you order and how long your line is. Not bad right?! Near the evening, it's a little less people, but waiting time remain the same as lunch. However, this time, when we went there it was at night around 7:30 PM. Very terrible customer service. I'm not saying that they were remarking snide comments or was yelling at us or anything like that. They gave us a silent treatment after our orders. We waited over 30 minutes and there were some people, but wasn't crowded or anything. Some people came in order their food and got their food right away before us. At first, I thought this was racism because we were Asian and everybody else that was dining and taking out weren't Asian. But I think it was just simply poor management. Their excuse was, the Chicken Kabob took a lot of time. Which is fine if that was the case, but they did not tell us beforehand or gave us any warning when we ordered it. Me and my cousins, we sat at the table right in front of their registered, and yet, they treated us like ghost as in we weren't even their. They didn't bother trying to provide an excuse why we had to wait so long until we had to say \"hey, why is it taking so long?\" Their faces look surprised as if we didn't ordered anything. But anyway, even though, their excuse was the Chicken Kabob took a lot of time to cook, when we came home, the Kabob was pretty dried and overcooked. This was truly a sad and unfortunate situation for us because we were really hungry. But what's done is done. Basically, my issue with this place was the night time management. It really is terrible. But other than that, I recommend going lunch hour or before 6 PM. Night people are terrible as it seems. Very unmotivated to work and to greet people sincerely.",

    "text": "This place is A-OK. A solid 3 stars. I travel a lot and admittedly I'm a tough critic when it comes to Greek/Mediterranean restaurants. I usually order the same thing (the Mediterranean Sampler, i.e. vegetarian mezze platter) at every place, so I have a pretty good gauge on these things...  That being said... This place is good, especially for where it's located. But nothing really stood out as over-the-top AMAZING. However, I'd be happy to go back.   Portion sizes seemed on-par with the pricing.  Service was slow but friendly. Food quality (i.e. taste, freshness, etc.) was A-OK.  You won't go wrong going here - but it's not a standout experience. Just good ole' Greek food in a fast-food setting.  My partner ordered a Greek salad with salmon on top. It was all prepared well - but again, very basic and nothing that stood out to us.",

I know I'm missing out on a lot of other great options also and maybe one day I'll give in but today is not the day.  First off, always, I repeat always go for the upgrade and get the Greek fries! There is a vinaigrette of some sort they put on their fries that give those frenchies an extra pop of delicious flavor. Secondly, I'm never disappointed with my gyro here. The flavors are always on point and the amount of meat they put in the pita is more than substantial. You definitely get more then what you pay for here and I couldn't be happier that it's just down the road from me!",

Very fresh and soft pita bread, juicy tender steak melted in my mouth, and what a perfect blend of ingredients for a well rounded taste combination. Will definitely be coming back and bringing others here as much as possible. Last, but most important by far would be the bible scriptures on the wall proclaiming the Truth and making it known that their success comes from God.   Great job Pita Kitchen!!!

I ate all my Greek Fries, which is a huge thing, because I am the girl who picks at fries, eating a total of 3-5 usually. I ate almost the whole box. I didnt love the chicken shawarma pita. It had  like a tad too much nutmeg or cinnamon or allspice flavor in it.  Maybe its more of a Greek Style, but I was expecting something covered in Turmeric, garlic, cumin. Overall I can't wait to come back again. It was pretty packed so we just took it to go, but it was  cute place. Staff was all  very nice as well, offered us water while we waited.",

My mom ordered the same thing as I and thought the food was good.  And my step-dad ordered the chicken souvlaki.  It came with rice and salad.  He liked it so much he almost cleaned his plate!

    "text": "Sorry wont get a favorable review from me. Went there 26th of june ordered gyro, and greek salad to go.When I got home and started eating my meal, third bite into gyro I had to pull an 8inch long black hair from my mouth. Beyond disgusting! I did not call to complain, rather I emailed company as their receipt states for comments, or concerns. I waited 3/4 days and recieved no response. I emailed them again, i stated, either they were too busy to respond , or I surmised they didnt care. I was expecting at the very least an apology, maybe they would offer a refund, but much to my surprise, I again received no response from them. So to say I am dissapointed, and somewhat disgusted would be accurate. Bottom line I would never patronize pita kitchen again, not sure what other unhealthy, or unsanitary  conditions may, or may not exsist in their kitchen. And apparantly they didnt care enough to address my situation ,  too bad for them, so eat at your own disgression",

    "text": "I admit to being confused by the review posted before mine:  to compare this place to the Golden Greek is like comparing McDonald's to the Russian Tea Room!  Granted, they both serve Greek food; but no matter what your opinion about the Golden Greek  (and mine isn't good:  see my review of them!), this place is, like most \"Greek\" places in the Valley, a pseudo-fast food restaurant, while the Golden Greek serves actual meals.  I also don't get the line about the pita bread:  the pita bread here is of the cheapest sort:  fluffy and thick.  You may like that; but \"real\" pita bread is like the ones served at the Golden Greek and Haji Baba's (for example):  thin and doughy.  Prices are fair?  Yeah, that's about right ... \"fair\" as in on a scale from \"bad\" to \"excellent\":  the appetizers (hummus, babaganouj, dolmas, etc.) are priced fairly in comparison to other places, but that doesn't mean they're good:  $6+ for a \"large\" appetizer, which, while \"wide\" on the plate is not deep, is not \"fair\".  I won't even bother talking about the dolmas, because NOWHERE is that a good deal; it's a top money maker for all Mediterranean restaurants:  5 or 6 dolmas for $ 5.00, when you can get a large can of about 60 or more for the same price  (try the market at Baiz or Haji Baba).    Now the taste:  the hummus was interesting.  Tasty and with a touch of cayenne pepper.  Very unusual for hummus, but, you know what?  It worked:  definitely wiped out any expected blandness, but was not strong enough to overpower.  Good job there.  The babaganouj was strange.  Again:  tasted good.  But it wasn't very \"smoky\" and the consistency was almost buttery.  Both traits very uncommon for this dish.  The dolmas were excellent, but obviously straight out of the can.  Thankfully, very firm (just the way I like them).  The Greek salad was good, but nothing spectacular.  For a fast food place like this  --- and yes, I'm sorry:  I would classify this as a \"fast food\" joint --- it was especially good.  My partner said the chicken shwarma was good, but he was glad he had sides, because it wouldn't have come close to being enough for him by itself  (then again, if any of you have read my reviews, you know already that his athletically muscular build hides an enormous appetite ... one day, we went to a buffet and Godzilla was impressed with how much he ate! ... Pretty bad, when you can outeat a Japanese dinosaur).  Decor in the restaurant is nice, though, when it's crowded, it's quite noisy:  my loss, but obviously their gain ... they're not there to run an empty joint.  Seating, however, is VERY limited:  we saw two families open the door and leave shortly afterwards:  there's only 6 booths and 2 tables, so it doesn't take a lot of people to fill it.  Overall, if you have a craving for Mediterranean food and are willing to not expect a whole lot, then this place is more than acceptable.  But it in no way compares to the Golden Greek or any other \"real\" restaurant, regardless of whether the food is better or not.",

The food today was like it always has been, awesome. The rice, chicken,  and beef were cooked and hot. The salad was great. We learned that they are getting, or have, a system to be able to order online at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpitakitchen.net&s=604e11cc1e3bb92984c5c4a6727527ef524fd316701aabd710ac6f5870718ca4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pitakitchen.net</a> so we won't have to wait on the phone. I'm once again so glad that they have redeemed their 5 star status as they truly are one of my favorite restaurants to go for lunch.",

Our last few trips have been a big let down and I forgot to call an tell them so I'll tell all: the salads are $10 for a small portion of ragged old lettuce and a few pieces of chicken here an there. The gyro my husband had was also skimping on portion and the pita was hard! Their meals are also pricey in my opinion and you'll get crap fries, compared to the alternative My Big Fat Greek.",

As one of the few places that is close enough to my work for me to get there and back during my lunch break this is a True go to for me.  I tried the chicken shawarma my first time there and have a hard time convincing myself to try anything else since it was so goo. The flavors are fantastic and the chicken is moist and perfectly cooked. The portion on the plate is great too as it comes with plenty of rice and salad along with a warm pita and some tahini sauce.  I did try the steak as well and while it was still really good I wouldn't pick it over the chicken unless I needed a change of pace meal.   The prices are right inline with what you would expect and I am always greeted warmly and with great customer service, I do take out a lot and the phone service is just as nice and orders ready when they say they are.  If you are in the area I highly recommend checking them out.",
