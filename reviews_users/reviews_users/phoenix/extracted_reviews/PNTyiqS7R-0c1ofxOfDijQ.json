I have to admit,  I was disappointed when I found out that Cafe Monarch has changed owners.  I have heard many great things about this place and finally when I  checked it out, they told me about the change.  I was nervous how my experience would be with a different chef.  I am glad they still lived up to their expectation!  :)",

I looked up and there was no rain. It rained for like 20 minutes a half an hour ago... but I guess they rather have you drive there first before they refuse to take you in. It didn't rain the rest of the night either. Ended up going to a steakhouse down the street and sitting on their patio. Too bad for them because we were planning on getting a few gift certificates there too.",

    "text": "I try to approach food reviews with a bowl full of practicality.  After all, it's just food right?  Someone makes it for you.  You eat it.  It goes to your stomach and you get full.  The collection of tastes, regardless of magnificence, are quickly filed into your culinary memory shortly after you pay and go on your merry way, reserving a moment to determine the probability of your return.    Cafe Monarch is a place where you can go to eat.   A restaurant by definition.   But to simply lump it into that broad classification is criminal.  Mind you, I despise flowery, over-hyped statements seemingly assigned to all things food (and wine) but this place is so much more than a restaurant.  It left me  desperately trying to grasp and hold the sensations of food, wine, atmosphere, music, service, comfort and how they all seemed to work in harmony to make our visit remarkable.   I'm a practical man and mostly grown up.  I try not to get caught up in hype or revel in the splendor of things like froe gras and Manila clam chowder or something called a Winter Salad which were all among best things I've ever put in my mouth.  But I couldn't help it.  I found myself eating each course more intently, careful not to overlook a taste, and to appreciate the complexity of flavors and the work that must go into each production.  I didn't want it to end.    You will read enough reviews about their food, and I understand it changes weekly, but ours was spectacular.  I am certain I would have enjoyed it while sitting on a rusted tailgate in the middle of nowhere, but I am also certain the deliberate attempt to create such ambiance made my food and wine taste even better.  Our servers were accommodating, wildly-attentive and wine-knowledgeable never once demanding my wine taste of Sandalwood - which I have yet to taste in any wine.  Ever.  The restroom was spotless, reminded me of a Parisian sitting room and smelled like flowers or the exact opposite of how restrooms usually smell, which was nice - even for a man.  The space, though relatively small, is cleverly conceived and just plain cool and undeniably romantic, especially the patio, with its tasteful lighting, vine and plant-laden fences and enough space heaters to make everyone comfortable on what was a typical winter's eve.    The lofty recommendation to visit Cafe Monarch for the first time generated such heavy expectations which usually leads to disappointment on some level.  But there was not a shred of disappointment in any aspect of our experience.  In fact, everyone in our party shared the same sentiment that we had all experienced something very intentional and marvelous.  Something we are still reliving a few weeks after our visit.  Something we all long to experience again.  I can say without hesitation the worst part of the entire night was that eventually it had to come to an end.  Thank you Cafe Monarch for making such an impression.",

Seating should be limited in the courtyard and crammed together.  Biggest disappointment was while I had made a 7 pm reservation they told us our table wasn't quite ready so they proceeded to sit us outside on the front patio to wait and then took cocktail orders.  We noticed they did this with every party that arrived after us.  We didn't get seated until 7:45, two cocktails later!  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  No apology so I guess this is the standard for customer service here.  Definitely lowered the bar and I have removed them from my list for special occasions.  10 - 15 minutes delay is acceptable but 45 minutes is a management issue with over booking.",

The service here is always equally amazing, and it's hard to find good service in old town. Ask for Marlen, he does a great job, very knowledgeable! My boyfriend is a foodie and could write for days about flavor profiles and textures, etc but all you need to know is that the food tastes great. I really appreciate that the menu changes every week because every week there is something new to be excited about trying. I also highly recommend trying every dish just as the chef has prepared it (as long as it doesn't interfere with allergies of course). I can be a picky eater at times but everything on the plate is there for a reason and I have surprised myself at how much I enjoy certain ingredients when they are used the right way. This place is perfect for romantic/special occasions, the outside courtyard is very beautiful decorated and cozy. One of my favorite AZ restaurants!",

The indoor seating is limited and it seems as though all seats are right next to the door, which you will notice as the door opens and closes as the staff comes and goes every couple of minutes in their inefficient trips to the kitchen.  The staff was invasive, as they tried to remove our plates at least 3 times while we were still eating. We went for our anniversary, paid over $200 and were in and out of there in 50 minutes. It felt rushed and despite enjoying the food I can't imagine paying that much again for a rushed noisy meal when hoping for something more relaxing.  The outdoor seating is preferred by most patrons, but the night we went it was 50 degrees and we were told the outdoor seating was full. At that temperature I'd rather sit inside, but a tall bar style table next to the door carries no elegance.  The music indoors can be so loud that it will stop conversation, changes in volume can surprise you, quiet for a song or two and then a jazz song will queue up at a different volume level and make conversation across the table difficult for 5 minutes or so.",

    "text": "Chris at Cafe Monarch is an extremely talented and inventive chef who puts those skills to good use making great food that's healthy, tasty and satisfying.  If you want single bits of exquisite ravioli, one pea and some coconut foam, you're at the wrong place.  If you want a great meal, read on.  We went for his Smokehouse Sunday - the best ribs I have *ever* had, great chicken, great sides.  We've been for lunch - amazing salads, a fantastic take on the BLT: now, I understand, off the menu, and I can't wait to see what's replaced it..  BYOB; there's a reasonable selection at the Circle K round the corner, and their walk-in beer fridge is a great place to spend five minutes when the sun's beating down outside.",

Everything about the experience was amazing.One of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever seen. I love all the touches with candles and lanterns. So romantic and we seriously loved the place. First taste was a crostini with jalapeno jam, brie cheese and green. Delicious! I wish I had more. First course was a beet salad with toasted hazelnuts. Also very good and I don't even like beets. Second course was a choice between filet and salmon. My boyfriend got the filet and I got the salmon. Both were incredible! And dessert was a pastry with fruit and ice cream. Pretty good, I enjoyed it and I usually like chocolate more. Overall such a great dining experience Got to meet the owner and the chef after dinner. All super polite and engaging. We will be back!!! Perfect location for a rehearsal dinner :)",

    "text": "We walked in without a reservation after the dinner rush about 8:30pm and got a table, it was a Saturday night so I was happy. I had tried to call for a reservation but the phone just rang. The patio outside is one of the most romantic spots I've ever been too. I was very excited when I saw the room, unfortunately for us it was a prix fixe menu which we both are not fans of. The place has an extremely small kitchen so this is done so everything can be pre-made to keep up with the customers orders. You get soup or salad a meat or fish and a dessert not much of a choice all were quite ordinary. The staff was great, owner was there walking around and asking about the food and service. I didn't have the heart to tell him everything was served cold my biggest complaint about dining. I hate cold food to me it's a real faux pas for an establishment. I totally understand their plight because the place is so small which is usually a real plus for me. My old chef told me many years ago that places that seat over 75 serve bad food. I may have just hit a bad night and most folks give it rave reviews. I'm not a fan of poached fish either and that was what I had since my wife got the meat dish. Was back in Scottsdale recently but did not return to Cafe Monarch.",

    "text": "The raves for Cafe Monarch are supremely justified.  Had Chef Chris all to ourselves last night and man, did he pull off a five star dining experience!   We started with an icy timbale of roasted salmon and orzo, redolent with fresh dill, capers, and sharp peppercorns, served alongside a quartered tomato at the peak of tender ripeness-- with a plump caperberry nestled inside--pickled whimsy.  Main course came with two choices. Option1: A slow roasted pork loin, rolled in a spicy mixture accented with the warm aroma of toasted cumin. The pork was complemented by a cooling salsa of green Thompson grapes and rounded out with sauteed black quinoa, done pilaf style.  Option 2: A perfectly rendered crisp, juicy veal chop, enriched by an ethereal cream sauce of ancho chile and cilantro. Also starring: roasted local corn and sauteed spinach, providing a snap of green flavor/color to this already gorgeous dish.  Dessert: Golden peaches quartered and baked in a crusted veil of lemon scented streusel and finished with a healthy dollop of silky whipped cream.  Perfection!  A dinner with Chris is a uniquely intimate affair, his warmth and culinary ingenuity will leave the toughest critic contented.  Cannot wait to gift my nearest and dearest with another evening at Cafe Monarch.",

    "text": "To be surprised... and joyously so! That's what comes to mind when I think of Cafe Monarch.  It is definitely a place where one can practice the arts of \"going with the flow,\" \"shooting the breeze,\" \"smelling the roses,\" and whatever other cliches you can think of that involve taking the time to enjoy oneself AND the people your with AND the setting that surrounds you... It's about being here and now and definitely not in a hurry. If you can do that, then, you will have a wonderful time.  It's an interesting dynamic. If you walk in, everything will be a surprise... but the man of all trades in the land of the Monarchs, Christopher, will accomodate you as best he can with the ingredients he has on hand that day. It is a very casual conversation you will have with him in lieu of selecting off a menu. You'll discuss allergies, likes & dislikes and what's available in the kitchen. The day a friend and I went, Christopher was cooking lamb... he described it has very Mediterranean with olives and I immediately stated my un-love affair with the pitted fruit. He then said he could make a lovely orange glaze and both my friend and I said that'd be wonderful... and oh was it... the Lamb, the Spinach with Barley and Pineapple... the pretty Tomatillo and Roasted Pepper... all of it was DIVINE! (Refer to pics to drool and be jealous). If you were vegetarian or vegan or didn't eat lamb, at this point in the scenario, the experience may not be the best it could be, so you see, you must be open minded and equipped with foodie cojones just walking up to an establishment like Cafe Monarch and just in case, be equipped with a Plan B restaurant... if you do end up using the Plan B, I feel very sorry for you... you'll be missing out!  A better way to go if you are picky, or have a specific allergies/diets is to make reservations for dinner and discuss all that with Christopher prior to dining. I have yet to try this, but can't wait for my second dining experience at dinner time! Whichever way you choose to approach this unique cafe, there is an element of Chef-surprise, and I think that is SPECIAL and we are lucky to have Cafe Monarch in Metro Phoenix... it truly is an experience.  One final tip: Bring CASH, Christopher only deals in \"paper.\" And this can be another analogy... Plastic = Fake, Paper = Real = Cafe Monarch!",

    "text": "To give a brief update/clarification on my previous negative review (which I still completely stand behind) - and the reply from the Manager there. Yes, we did have a reservation, in my boyfriends name. I messaged the manager back privately and haven't heard a peep since. Seems they only try to save face on something public vs actually trying to fix the problem with the upset customer.  Previous Review:  It is with great sadness that I give Monarch a 1 star review.  I have come here several times over the last few years and the food has been very good until my last visit where I got horrible food poisoning. It was absolute hell for a full 2 days after. I won't go into more details.  I'm not just writing a 1 star review because the establishment got me ill from their food (although frankly, that should be enough). I'm also writing this review because of the bad reservation policy and service.   Every single time I have come here, I've had a reservation, and EVERY SINGLE TIME I have had to wait for my table or simply not been seated where I wanted. In the winter, you want to be outside on their beautiful terrance, not cooped up inside, and yep you have to wait for AGES that its not even worth it because you are so hungry that you end up sitting inside.   On the flip side, in the summer you don't want to dine in 110 degree heat so you want to be inside. Whenever you go, you won't get seated where you want. They claim to \"reserve you a table at the restaurant, not an indoor or outdoor specific place\" what is the point of this? The entire point of a reservation is to sit where you want. We made reservations on our anniversary and had to wait OUTSIDE in the HEAT (August in AZ is not kind) for 45 minutes for a table. What the actual hell is that about. Terrible management of the establishment and then to add insult to injury I got sick from the food.   I will not be returning here, and I don't think anyone else should either. Reservation problems can ruin a special occasion and no one wants to get sick.",

We arrived slightly early for our reservation and were seated in the porch area where we ordered a drink and were served a free appetizer. It was small, but wonderful. We were then taken to our table which was in the courtyard area, which was absolutely beautiful. The service was incredible and each course was impeccable. I think the first course, the roasted cauliflower soup, was our absolute favorite. One of the most amazing meals we have shared, and it all felt very special. We were also served a free dessert, which was some sort of custard or ice cream filled donut- we were quite full by this point, but it was much appreciated-  just wish we could have eaten more of it! It is quite expensive, but well worth it!   Thank you, Cafe Monach, for a wonderful meal!",

    "text": "BEST DINING EXPERIENCE, in a very long time! My boyfriend surprised me and took us to Cafe Monarch, for our weekly date night. I had never been and was shocked at how beautiful the outside seating is!    The ambiance is perfectly romantic, with hanging lights, huge lanterns, candles and water fountains. The service is spectacular. All the servers are extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. And the valet was fast.  The menu does not have a huge selection, but you will not be disappointed. It's a four-course meal, with the pricing based on your largest and final course. The portions are on the smaller size, but after the entire meal, you feel full. The best thing on the menu is the cauliflower soup. If you go, you MUST try it.",

My husband got the surf & turf with had a piece of beef filet, Chilean sea bass & lobster ravioli. It all melted in his mouth! The staff brought us a dessert crepe served w/ gelato & a lit sparkler on top! We picked this restaurant because of the NUMEROUS 4.5-5 ratings! All the ratings are spot on!!

    "text": "We were in Scottsdale on a short vacation and dined at Cafe Monarch's new location last night. It is across the street from their old location. Our server told us they had moved only 3 weeks prior. The restaurant decor is beautiful! We were seated in the patio area which had a very romantic ambience.  A fireplace and space heaters were enough to provide heat on that beautiful evening.  We were impressed at the outset because they offered us seats at the bar and offered us 2 glasses of wine (my husband had one) after we were informed that our table wasn't ready for us when we arrived on time for our reservation. We didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes for our table.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the four-course prix-fixe menu to be very well-priced.  The first 3 courses were delicious (roasted cauliflower soup or rock shrimp, winter salad, crab cake) and my husband especially enjoyed his main course,  filet mignon. My only complaint was that my sea bass, though cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned and the bananas foster beignets did not meet our expectation.    We thought the service was on point. Our server and support team were all friendly and very attentive. We got to chat with our server for quite a bit about the Scottsdale area. If we find ourselves in the area in the future, we would not hesitate to dine here again.",

My dinner was cauliflower soup .. amazing, beet course .. amazing, pork roulade .. honestly I could have done without this one and had a sorbet cleanser instead, then filet mignon .. this whole plate was fabulous... the meat so tender, loved the sauce, the potatoes, veg .. everything scrumptious .. am running out of words to say how good this chef is.  My husband had everything up to the last course that matched me ... he though loved the pork roulade but thought an additional sorbet would have been nice. He had Kobe ribeye and OMG it is worth the price. He's been all over the world including Japan and said this is one of the finest cuts of Kobe beef he has ever had. I tried it too and it was over the top amazing.  Then they brought us flourless chocolate cake dessert plate that was a perfect end to a perfect evening.  Plus our champagne, drinks, wine .... all perfect.  But best of all was service.  I cannot even express the pleasant, knowledgeable, funny, friendly staff ... they and the amazing chefs truly make this experience one to put in the memory books.  God willing, we will be back for our 50th anniversary .. well actually am thinking we should go every year now leading up to 50!!!",

    "text": "I cannot say enough about Cafe Monarch! First, the atmosphere is very unique to anything I have experienced in the United States. Cafe Monarch brings me straight back to the best summer of my life, jaunting around Europe. Dining both inside and outside are rich sensory experiences--the hanging garden and generally the vast lushness of the outside seating feels like a private corner of paradise. Inside I love the artwork, the scents, the music... everything feels intimate and special.   The service, I think, is unparalleled in terms of restaurants in the area. I generally am a big fan of the FRC restaurants, but they don't even hold a candle to Cafe Monarch. I can't tell you how many waiters I saw doubling as photographers, without a hint of mockery (more common than one might think.) Other than food, what I like about Cafe Monarch is the way they treat me. I feel good, I feel respected, even a little bit special. I wish that feeling came standard with every upscale dining experience, but I often leave nice restaurants feeling self conscious and inferior. Not here.   Ok the food. I love the rotating menu. Everything tastes fresh, flavorful, and creative. You can never go wrong with a soup or a steak. On my birthday I ordered an appetizer but was jealous of my best friend's soup. I found myself stealing spoonfuls until the waiter came over with my very own soup \"a birthday present.\"   If you have a special occasion, or just want to feel special, come here. You won't regret it.  UPDATE: I am removing one star because of everything Cafe Monarch has removed from their once very reasonably priced prix fixe menu. I think they raised the price, too, which is more understandable.",

    "text": "The BEST and most ROMANTIC restaurant ever.  The courtyard was mostly lit with candles - I cannot describe how beautiful it is.  You will have to see for yourself.  Very light easy-listening music playing in the background (not blaring and obtrusive like a lot of restaurants),  Our waiter was Steven and he was delightful.  We also had a young man that cleared plates and was kind enough to take our photo.  So the staff was courteous and prompt and discreet. They saw that we were enjoying ourselves and  did not disturb at all.  Some places try to hustle patrons in and out quickly.  The food was amazing.  The menu changes often so I can only comment on what we had:  Roasted Cauliflower Soup - I didn't think it sounded that good, but it was delicious.  Light and creamy and heavenly.  Salad (not sure of the exact title) but the candied bacon was over the moon.  Then a giant prawn - another winner.  My boyfriend had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was buttery and luscious. I had the filet and it was cooked exactly right.  We also had the rum cake for dessert - oh my goodness.  I wish I had a larger vocabulary to describe just how fantastic the food was.  We both had a glass of Malbec and it was spectacular - very, very smooth.  If you go to Scottsdale with your  significant other please do yourself a favor and make reservations for this place.  It is pricey, but so worth it.",

    "text": "Gracious gastronomic greatness  Had Cafe Monarch on our foodie bucket list since the flattering piece about it in Phoenix Magazine.  Originally wanted to partake last summer, before finding out that it is closed during hell season in the Valley.  My wife and I visited for Valentine's Day, instead.  The converted house is beautifully done.  Service staff isn't what you'll find at a five-star/diamond place in terms of polish, but they are none the less attentive and thorough.  Some tips: Do not forget that CM is cash only; make a reservation; is price ($45) per person; and is BYOD.  There were a number of couples disappointed to step up and find out the place is already booked until March.  Another was surprised there is no ATM.  Minor things if you remember and prepare.  Food was simply perfect.  The soup was delicate and you could play with the flavors in your mouth rather than be overwhelmed by salt or sugar or vinegar or even the stock.  The steak was immaculate in flavor and texture (he even cut against the grain).  And the dessert was an elating triple chocolate confection that mixed soft, crunchy, and smooth ganache flavors in a way I had not previously experienced.    Serving sizes are what they should be.  Nothing like the over-sized, moderate-quality options at even chain nicer chains.  The setup is each table belongs to you for the whole night and there's no rush to flip tables for volume.  Last, the chef gives the impression of a kinder Gordon Ramsey-- just as serious and meticulous, is direct with his wait crew about attentiveness, but is also kind with his efforts.  It was nice that he called ahead to incorporate our food preferences.  Was more impressive that he remembered my wife's name when we checked out.   Cafe Monarch helped make our Valentine's a superb night.  The dishes are wonderfully memorable.  We'll be back for brunch, dinners, and new food experiences.",

    "text": "Celebrated 10yr anniversary this past Friday. Had left a message earlier in the day and requested an outdoor seat. Unfortunately they could not accommodate and were told we could wait an hour for a table to open up. Wasn't going to happen so we gladly took our seat in the empty interior dining area.  The Good: Food and service were tremendous. Couldn't go wrong with the various course options and thoroughly enjoyed our food and bevies.   The Bad:  There is one shared toilet in the entire place. My wife and I had a few drinks elsewhere before dinner...huge mistake. My fist trip to the bathroom shortly after arriving was a 20 minute fiasco.  Some old Scottsdale bulimic was in there purging her foie gras. Shortly after I had voiced my concern to a manager, this surgically altered specimen (cross between a Siamese cat and a duck) emerges from the bathroom and passes by without a word. Line is several people deep at this point so I quickly rushed my business and ran back to the table. Now my wife had to go and there was still a line...I'll spare you the details, but unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. Would rather have a port-a-potty outside to use than deal with that again.  Really broke up what could have been a special meal. Spending half the night waiting to tinkle instead of enjoying a candlelit experience with your loved one was a bummer.   Tip: Wear adult diapers or dehydrate yourself prior to arrival. Minus 2 stars for lacking facilities required to micturate.",

They just have fixed menus that you have to choose one of the limited options they have and each of the options is super expensive. 65$ per person. When we arrived there the waitress said we have to choose one of the options in fixed menu beside our coffee if we want to sit there and when we ordered, we just found out it's gonna be 65$ per person.

    "text": "Just an incredible place. Former owner Chef Christopher is in my opinion the best chef in town, so when he sold or closed Cafe Monarch, I thought that was the end of one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. But alas, never have I been disappointed at monarch still. New ownership picked up right where it left off and have even made some pleasant additions. I have had intimate dinners with a date, as well as large group dinners and every time I leave more than pleased by every facet of the meal. Family style dinner with a group of about 15 others was probably my favorite experience ever here. Menu changes frequently, but everything I have ever had is either very good or exceptional. Can't say enough good things.  Food: incredible Ambiance: very homey. Romantic, comfortable, a+ Drinks: addition of full bar is nice, good cocktails. Didn't mind the old days when it was only BYOB either though.  Service: spot on.   One of the top restaurants in the entire valley, and southwest for that matter.",

    "text": "Took my wife and two friends to Monarch for wife's birthday back in April and had a wonderful experience. We arrived too early and it kind of threw Christopher off a bit. Wasn't sure how long it would take to get there, but he took it in stride and greeted us warmly. Love the concept and the atmosphere here, completely relaxed vibe but still upscale enough and a perfect celebration spot.  Food is good, but Christopher and the restaurant itself are the real stars here. When we visited there was no assistant and somehow Christopher was able to talk with all of his tables and still put out high quality plates. Makes dinner a more intimate experience, which is exactly what a birthday dinner with friends calls for. Wife and i had fish and our friends had lamb chops. Meats were prepared well and tasted good, but the times between plates, sipping wine and looking over the fire are the reason we will be back. If you have a few bottles of wine that you have been saving for a great meal/experience with friends, give Christopher a call and make plans to visit Cafe Monarch soon!",

    "text": "After reading several on-line reviews of Cafe Monarch promoting its concept of a personal chef for a night, and fantastic food preparations it became a \"Must try!\" for me. I went with a group of 4 people total (two from out of town) to enjoy chef Chris' creation. We made reservations several weeks prior for a Sunday night. We were hoping for Saturday night, but it was rented out for a private party, which is quite common for this place.   We show up and get seated at our table inside in a little bit of an alcove so we were away from the rest of the tables, and certainly enjoyed the privacy afforded by such placement. Chris comes right over and welcomes us, double checks for food allergies or special preparations (he asked when we made the reservation as well), and opens our bottles of wine (BYOB in case you did not know). He tells us to relax and enjoy ourselves while he prepares the first course of hummus and arugula salad with capers and corn chips. The portions are very large and most of the table did not finish the dish completely, saving room for the main course.   The main course comes out and we have our choice of pork medallions in a citrus pepper glaze or a salmon fillet with a tarragon cream sauce. We get two of each in order to try as much as possible. Neither dish disappointed. The pork was cooked perfectly and tasted like it was dry rubbed with a red pepper mixture and then grilled and topped with a sauce that resembled confetti. As best as we could tell it had a mango and pineapple base with basil, chilies, and a variety of other seasonings. The pork was good enough to stand on its own, but the glaze made it exponentially better.   The salmon was pan fried and topped with a simple cream, sherry, and tarragon mixture. Once again, the protein is more than capable of standing on its own, however the sauce takes it to the next level.   Dessert was a poached pear dish in a burgundy reduction with a chocolate drizzle and a puff pastry, which was mentioned in previous reviews. It was very light, and a perfect ending to our meal.   Overall the meal took about two and a half hours, but we were in no rush and really enjoyed ourselves. Chris was an amazingly gracious host and making people happy seems to come to him NATurally. It was a wonderful experience and we plan on making up reasons to justify going back to see what else this one man band can serenade us with again and again.",

    "text": "Where do I start with the Cafe Monarch experience?  I guess at the beginning.  Last winter a good friend took me to lunch at Cafe Monarch and it was love at first bite.  Christopher, the owner/chef/server/bon vivant and everything came over and described all the choices, but I asked if I could have the bacon/fig/pepper club sandwich as a salad.  He said yes and it was LOVE!!!!  So, now the food makes you misty and so does Christopher.  Most salads can start off well, but about halfway through you are thinking that while good, it's the same thing again. Every bite of Christopher's salads is a new experience, from start to finish.  One bite might be savory and sweet, the next crunchy and spicy. You cannot believe that a salad can have that many fabulous permutations, but it does and it happens every time.  And if there is hummus, don't even get me started!!!  After that first experience, Christopher and Cafe Monarch became my MUST EAT place. The setting is intimate and artsy and European and funky and just plain FUN!!! The food combinations are seemingly endless and it never disappoints.  I spent my birthday there with my husband who is a picky or some might say \"fussy\" eater.  He doesn't like sauces or too many combinations and on and on.  I was a bit worried that the birthday evening could devolve into something unpleasant if he didn't love it as much as did I, but there was no need to worry because he LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.  It was one of the best birthdays ever.  This led us to beg Christopher (yes, we were willing to beg) to return a bit early from his summer closing to create the perfect birthday dinner for my husband's BIG birthday. I won't say the age, but it was one of THOSE birthdays where you want to make sure it is special.  We had 17 people for what everyone has described as the most magical evening they have experienced, perhaps ever or at least rarely.  People that I would never have expected to \"get it\" were immediately bowled over by the ambiance, the intimacy and the fun that prevailed.  When someone asked me after the fact how I would rate the experience on a scale of 1 to 10, I said without hesitation 400!!!  In life we often want things to match our pictures, this so far exceeded our pictures of the evening that it at times defies description.    When you are at Cafe Monarch you feel you are at home or at the home of a dear, intimate friend.  If food is love, then this is the place of boundless love.  I have just finished lunch there today and will be heading back on Saturday for our anniversary.  For us, it is the best \"go to\" place in the Valley and I have lived here a long time and eaten a lot of great food.",

We were given two choices for brunch at $20 which includes tax and tip.  Sweet (baked french toast with bacon and fresh berries) or Savory (chicken with a sweet red chile sauce and two eggs sunnyside up).  We decided to each order one and share.  The sweet dish was ok, the french toast didn't have a lot of flavor but the berries were fresh and the bacon was extra crispy (yum!).  The savory dish was very good and had a nice taste.  Overall a nice sunday experience, a bit pricey for breakfast (breaks down to about $16 a plate before tax/tip) but might try again to see what else comes up on the menu.",

There is no skipping on ingredients, quality, flavor or imagination.  I have only eaten at this little gem twice, simply because I live rather far but, both times the food was excellent.  Today I experienced the most amazing breakfast/brunch, the most perfectly cooked eggs with spinach, portobello mushrooms and loads of grated cheese, the eggs were like fluffy clouds just melted in my mouth.  The bacon though was the show stopper, I took the first bite just expecting bacon, what I actually got was a complete explosion in my mouth, I wasn't sure at first what all the the flavors were, confusion to my mind at first bite but,  oh so delicious confusion!  Seems that Christoper doesn't just dish out bacon he drizzles it with honey, then he tops it with finely chopped cilantro and finally mixes in bits of hot red peppers......for an OMG taste.   Crunchy, salty, sweet, spicy, earthy all the flavors so compliment, this is how bacon should always be served!",

We had a delightful brunch, felt we could be in Provence, and ate the most wonderful and interesting food. It was a sort of quiche but lighter and taller, filled with sausage and topped with a delicate sprinkling of cheese. A beautiful green salsa sauce well placed to the side and some divine-ish asparagus, artichokes and mushrooms to the other side, made the symphony of flavors complete. Our second visit to Cafe Monarch was just as wonderful as visit #1 for a Saturday lunch.  Now, we are delightfully planning our first evening visit to enjoy the 3-course dinner and showcase this gem to our visitors from CT in late April.",

Some of the ingredients felt wasted. An extraordinarily succulent scallop's delicate umami was somewhat smothered by heavy-handed overseasoning. A dish of exquisitely plump and fresh shrimp lost some of its possible impact by being heavily breaded; the texture and tang of the shellfish meat itself lost amid the batter. It was good, but definitely not great. Also my steak knife had a filthy handle. These are not devastating critiques, I had a lovely evening, and will likely return again on occasion, but when the bill for my table is close to a mortgage payment, I dare hope for more than these somewhat amateurish attempts at haute cuisine.",

It was my wife's birthday and he treated her like royalty with complimentary champs to start and dessert to finish. The restaurant also gave her a very nice gift. The food was outstanding. The best thing on the menu was the cauliflower soup. I know that is nuts to say, but it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. The filet appetizer was so tender I cut it with my butter knife. The entire meal was extremely memorable. While the prices might seem high, this restaurant is not expensive for what you are actually experiencing and I would recommend it to anyone who's passion is food.",

    "text": "My final Yelp review for 2016, boy what a year it has been!  We spent our NYE dinner at Monarch, a gorgeous restaurant in Scottsdale offering a set 4-course menu for $150/pp.  You get the soup and salad, and then choose from two 3rd courses and from four main courses.  Dessert not included and is extra.  Every dish I selected (including dessert) was superb and would have been solid 5-stars.  However, my wife's main course and dessert choice were both subpar (2-3 stars).  I'm averaging the two and bumping up my rating to 4 stars since I really liked the awesome service and ambiance.  As for the dinner:  * Kaboucha-Cauliflower soup was superb - the sweetness balanced by the saltiness of black truffle.  Awesome grilled bread to eat with the soup!  5 stars  * Winter Salad was a creative, multilayered salad with dual dressings.  It had some mild spiciness but I really liked the crunchiness of the corn vs the softness of the couscous.  You get flavors of bacon and chilis too. 5 stars  * Both 3rd course options were good - seared scallop with parsnip puree and a lamb lollipop that was super tender and slightly sweet.  A lollipop for sure! 5 stars for both.  * The main course had a divergence.  My filet mignon (medium rare) was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The whole poached lobster tail on top of it was likewise perfect, as were the roasted potatoes and other puree sides (5 stars).  My wife chose the chicken which turned out to be a mistake - overcooked, dry, and lacking flavor.  (2 stars).  * Dessert was another divergence.  Flourless Chocolate Cake was excellent - mostly sweet, some bitter to balance things out, and all moist! (5 stars).  The wife chose rum cake which was super sweet and had no detectable rum flavor at all - it was closer to a honey-soaked cake (2 stars).    Service was top-notch, and I think its possible to have a 5-star meal here by sticking to the filet and lobster and chocolate cake.    Never order chicken from a restaurant unless the chef owner's last name is Keller or if eating at Lalla Grill in Monterey, CA.",

    "text": "Came with a couple brothers for a reunion dinner, plus it was neat seeing something from Scottsdale on OpenTable's Top 100 Restaurants for the year.   Made a reservation for Tuesday night 8:30, but we checked in early at 6:30 and they had a table for us! Apparently they moved across the street 3 weeks ago, so that might not be reflected on OpenTable's spaces. Noah helped us out for the night, and on his recommendation we interspersed the 3 add-on items in our menu to split. Courses 1-3 were meant as appetizers, so $30 more each to turn a 4 course meal into 7 was a great deal for us!  I don't want to spoil too much about the food, but I think it lives up to the expectation (and the price!). A lot of the seafood tasted very clean - some fish I could see being eaten by someone who hates seafood. Some of our entrees included filet and ribeye - easily beats the quality of cook and meat of some of the most acclaimed steakhouses around here. It might actually be the only time I'd recommend the filet over the ribeye, just because it was done that well. And splitting the add-ons is something we all recommend. With the exception of the Maine Diver Scallops that night, they tasted fantastic but might have been too much of one end of the palate before the entrees came out.  That being said, with a 95% perfect meal there will be imperfections. One edge of the pork belly might have been overcooked and crispy for my liking. And admittedly some of the drinks received poor customer reception compared to others - The Sebastian was fantastic enough as the only surviving cocktail of the old location, but the German Chocolate Martini tasted more tart than chocolate, subverting expectations in not a great way. If you aren't sure of the drinks, just ask or stick to their very refreshing infused water.  It's impeccable service really, and easily the best course menu/fancy dinner I've had in Arizona. Michelin Stars aren't a thing here, but the top notch service and well executed food mirrors 1 Star or 2 Star experiences I've had across the country. My only regret is not discovering Cafe Monarch sooner.",

There were a couple dishes I was very impressed with, but others I found too salty, and underwhelming. I would go back to enjoy the scene there, but for $250 for two people, and $60 to add Truffles to the dish, I'd expect to see a Michelin Star ;)",

    "text": "We found ourselves at this quaint, extremely charming restaurant called Cafe Monarch in downtown Scottsdale. Had we done more research, (I was tired...) we may have learned that it is one of the most highly touted restaurants in the area and one seldom gets in without a reservation. Here we are, under-dressed, with no reservation, but delightfully greeted at the door with a bit of hesitation; the staff surely wondering if we are prepared for a dining experience such as this. Ha! They didn't know who they were dealing with...  I will outline our meal and tell you all about the details of the exquisite menu that we selected from. However, I would be remiss if I didn't begin by telling you that it was one of the most incredible meals I have ever had with nary a miss on any dish. The service was also exemplary as one would expect from this level of dining.  Our meal began with a Roasted Cauliflower Soup - white truffle oil, crispy prosciutto and Gruyere grissini. Some chefs balk at the continued use of truffle oil. I haven't jumped on that bandwagon as I still love the truffle flavor and if it is done right - as this surely was, it offers a hint of flavor that elevates the dish ever so delicately!  Our next course was an Autumn Salad - local micro salad mix, charred brussels sprouts, candied applewood bacon, toasted pepitas, couscous, poblano, heirloom baby tomatoes, dried currants, crispy corn, Calabrian chili-garlic confit and a basil buttermilk dressing. Wow, all of that in this little salad. Each bite, an explosion of flavor with such an interesting mix of ingredients and a unique composition. Yep, loved it!  Next up; Anson Mills Shrimp & Grits - persimmon chutney, roasted pasilla peppers,  and micro cilantro. A little sweet, a little hot, a little creamy - I like it a lot!  My main was their Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon - Niman Ranch USDA prime beef, sunchoke puree, sauteed haricot verts, wild mushroom medley, charred cipollini onion, roasted fingerling potatoes, banyuls-beef jus emulsion. I love the fact that this filet mignon was cooked ever so perfectly and the execution of each and every vegetable or sauce was done with exact precision.  It's not over yet! Ok, so I did say something about being ok with just soup & salad for dinner, but now that we've gone this far - why stop now? We must finish this fabulous meal off with a bite of sweet. Suggested as the best in the house was their Rum Cake - pecan butterscotch, vanilla bean gelato and chantilly creme. Yes, it was as good as it looks, minus the shadows in my photo. A great end to a magnificent meal. One might think this is a once in a lifetime experience, and for many that might be what it is. However, for me, I can't wait to get back and try their new season's menu!",

We dined on the patio, and I felt like we had been transported to a villa in Italy.  Lights hung up above, beautiful garden surroundings...you feel special in a set up like this.  Our server, Sam, truly took us on a magical journey.  We opted to do the wine pairing with each food course, and Sam not only brought out fantastic wines to drink, but he talked to us about each wine, and why it compliments each dish.  We found out that he is also the sommelier at the restaurant, and his knowledge and passion for the wines really shined through and made us even more excited and enamored with our dining experience.  And the food; holy cow the food!!  Every course was truly special.  Their menu changes weekly, and we had the pleasure to enjoy many fantastic dishes. One dish in particular (the filet mignon) was highly recommended by our server Sam, and I am so glad he told us that because it was one of the best filet's I've ever eaten!  I 100% recommend coming to Cafe Monarch for a romantic, beautiful meal.  It was truly one of those food experiences that I will cherish for many years to come. :)",

    "text": "The service from entering to exiting Monarch is impeccable. Service is an art at Monarch. It's the kind royalty gets too used to. The waiters (I noticed only the men served) were attentive to every detail from when we needed water poured to folding our napkins if we left the table even momentarily. Our four-course meal was a palette adventure. A masterpiece that caused our tongues to lash out for being deprived of such intensely delicious flavors for so long! Not one dish was disagreeable. Not even the foie gras, an acquired taste of a meal. I would have been quite satisfied on the soup and salad alone.  My hubby prejudged that the seemingly small portions would not fill him up, but his stomach was feeling heavy before he even took his last bite. In our book, Monarch is reserved for the special, blue moon occasions.  And for us, and a few nearby table mates, that was exactly the case. We were celebrating our fourth wedding anniversary. We won't soon forget Monarch because we can't return any time soon.   Ambiance = 5 stars Service = 5 stars Food = 5+ stars Good time with hubby = pricey",

    "text": "When initially seated for our reservation, we were placed at a table near the bar area, which proved far too noisy. We asked to be seated elsewhere & after a few minutes, were advised they could move us but that the wait would be another 45 minutes. After deciding the wait was acceptable, we were lead to a set of small tables, which were placed in an area we found just as noisy. We asked if we might instead sit in the little area we'd been seated upon our arrival at the restaurant & were accommodated. (I suspect by this time they'd labeled us pretentious!) While awaiting the next table they graciously offered us a new round of cocktails & a delicious nosh (a bruschetta of shredded Brussels sprouts, nuts & jam; apologies to all for not capturing the exact ingredients). In what seemed little time at all we were taken to the courtyard & seated at a comfortable table towards the back. Sommelier, Wesam (Sam) Kawa, captured our selections from the four course prix fixe menu & was delighted we chose the wine pairing. Four of us were dining & we started with roasted cauliflower soup & scallop tartare. The white truffle oil & creme fraiche in the soup balanced the cauliflower beautifully, providing an earthy taste & luxurious mouthfeel. Subtle hints of lime highlighted the  gentle heat of the aguachile in the tartare. We moved to a salad of young bittersweet greens, compressed watermelon, softly pickled rind, lardon & lavash. Many people dismiss salad, yet shouldn't; especially when it's as delicately composed & as  lightly dressed as this one was. Two of us chose to follow the salad with the Niman Ranch beef stuffed samosa & two with the crab cake. The samosa was flaky; the combination of beef & tabbouleh & accompanying yogurt sauce complimented the crust without it becoming overly soft or soggy. I love pork, yet I'm often reluctant to order it out since it's typically over cooked. Sam convinced me to give the Iberico pork chop a try as my entry & I cannot thank him enough - it was succulent. Some may laugh, yet I chose not to eat all of my chop because I wanted to enjoy more (taking a large leftover portion home means I can delight in this entry over two days)! Had I known in advance how light & flavorful the rum cake we ordered for dessert would be, I'd have ordered three (gluttony: thy name is...)! Truly, this was a fresh food, full flavored, delicious & pleasurable dining experience!My compliments to the chef, his kitchen staff & to our server, Sam. My thanks as well to the management for their courtesy, complimentary cocktails & nosh.",

    "text": "My wife and I are retired restaurant owners/operators from the Chicago area, a well respected white tablecloth establishment for the past 32 years, still going strong. Our first visit to Cafe Monarch, although accidental, uplifted our spirits on this Mothers Day. The greeting could possibly use a hint of sophistication, of professionalism if you will; cute young ladies dressed in black is not synonymous of \"class\". This being said, our main server Richard was a delight to deal with, educated, well travelled, well spoken....his table-side manners are impeccable and well suited to the class the Monarch aims to belong to. Other wait staff members seemed well versed on the menu as well. The setting, outside, was one of the most romantic and classy environment one can hope for when fine dining! The menu selections could be seen as a bit short but considering the menu gets altered every other week or so......good choices. Perhaps I was a bit disappointed to hear the lamb was from NZ.....since the restaurant prides itself on featuring seasonal and local foods as much as possible...well? Colorado lamb is of high quality and somewhat closer than NZ...right? The cuisine was at the level of a 1+ Michelin star in France, not bad from a \"self taught\" Chef if I understood well. This young man has a bright future if he keeps at it and does not burn the stages of betterment. Our bottle of Ruinart Rose Champagne was chilled to perfection, such a pleasurable sensation! Richard overheard it was our 50th anniversary; he brought a dessert with a sparkler, a nice touch indeed! Greeting: 4 stars       Menu choices: 4 stars      wine list /service: 5 stars Food preparation/presentation: 4 stars    Service: 5 stars    Ambience/decor/appointments: 5 stars       Value: 5 stars (not cheap mind you , but worth it!)",

Only $25 for wine pairing, which comes close to 2.5 glasses (not counting the super generous Yelp check in offer of a free glass of house wine!), each of which was perfectly suited to match our course.  I can't wait to go back! Putting this on my \"top 5\"!

    "text": "I had high expectations based on the reviews, but unfortunately they were not met.  Came for my birthday but they didn't ask (so I didn't tell) and there was nothing special done for us. We were seated inside at an awkward table by a window with another couple basically pressed against the glass on the other side. The inside was nice but I was left wondering if the courtyard was nicer as other people after us refused indoor seats and asked to wait for an outdoor seat. I never even got to see it. The decor was cloying - like what a little girl's idea of romance looks like. The music was some nice trance-ambient though and my husband liked his cocktail.  The food was pretty good, but not great.   The cauliflower soup was too rich and distracting. It was heavy on the truffle flavor like what people think expensive food should taste like, and the few pine nuts were too heavily smoked tasting. The cauliflower was buried.   The spring salad was the best dish of the night - well balanced. The tuna was also tasty (excellent quality), but they had to substitute some of the ingredients and I think we missed out.  For mains, we got the filet and the crispy chicken. The filet was well cooked but nothing special. The chicken was a big disappointment - the skin was not even CLOSE to crispy, the flavors were muddled and bland. We also added the scallops which were great quality and well cooked, but the accompanying mess of dried corn, overdone pancetta, and some southwestern chili flavors were close but ultimately missed the mark.   We skipped dessert and left pretty quickly.",

Arrived for our reservation at 8:30. Taken straight back to our cozy little spot by the fountain on the patio. This place is beautiful. The lighting and ambiance in the back on the patio made me totally forget that merely hours earlier I was cursing at the sun and wondering if I would ever be able to hydrate again. The misters were on and it felt perfect (it hit 109 degrees today).  Our waiter came out quickly and explained the menu and we ordered some wine. Smallish wine list but some great choices. Went for some Oregon pino.  The meal started with amuse bouche of sweet pea soup with lobster, sweet corn and mint. This stuff was mouth watering. I could have had three more bowls....a solid start.  Next was a summer salad of arugula, citrus, compressed cucumber, and tomatoes. Fresh and delicious.  The only choice here, other than the drinks are to decide which entree you want. Tonight they had a choice between Hawaiian opah and flat iron steak. We ordered one of each. Both were amazing. The I fish had a wasabi flavored  puree side alone with a vegetable like hash ( I do it no justice ). So so,good. The steak was a perfect medium rare. My mouth is still watering just thinking about it.  Desert was a light peach Napoleon. Light, sweet, and yummy.  Yelp is rarely wrong. There is a good reason this place gets the best reviews. My wife was impressed, full, and snugly, just as planned. They even gave her a little birthday present.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I have zero negative things to say.   Bravo Cafe Monarch. Bravo.",

A highlight of both trips has been a chance to eat at Cafe Monarch.   The decor is almost unbelievable.  We've never taken so many pictures inside a restaurant.  During our first meal there, 3 people in our party actually took pictures of the decor in their bathrooms...and only later did we admit it to each other and laugh that their bathrooms were so fancy it was worth a quick photograph :)  This last trip the service was impeccable and the meal was excellent.  I personally had the Lobster Bisque, Sea Prawn, and Citrus Encrusted Chilean Sea Bass.   Every time we've been here we've paired our meal with the wine flight.  During other pre-fix meals with wine flight pairings we've found the pours to be very small.   Here they serve full glasses which are paired very well with the serving.     I can't recommend the locale, meal, and service enough.  I would check their menu online to prepare yourself for the price.   That said, we have found it worth every penny and are discussing our next trip to Scottsdale and meal at Monarch already.",

The noise level was quiet and calm, ambiance was enchanting and charming, and the service was just ok.  The server was not as attentive as I would like, but he was friendly.  We had to ask him for more waters a few times and tell him we were ready to order after waiting for at least 20 minutes.    You definitely will be spending a pretty penny (probably around $60-80/person).  The menu is extremely limited.  You get to pick one out of two options for an entree.  You are served soup first which was quite tasty.  Then a salad - watermelon, cheese, and arugula (I think).  It was pretty delectable.  I decided to order the salmon as opposed to the ribeye.  The salmon was really scrumptious.  I enjoyed every bite of it.  Then on to the dessert. Dessert was mediocre - whip cream, strawberries, and some kind of crisp wafer.    All in all, it was excellent, but I would save the visit and $$ for special occasions.",

I was a little hesitant having been told the same by other fine dining restaurants only to be served a salad I could make myself.  That couldn't have been farther from the case here.  Each course was brilliant in both taste and presentation.  Our server, Sam, had a fantastic knowledge of the wine list and was able to suggest a bottle that definitely suited our tastes.   The one and only negative I can report is that it was loud and crowded but that was understandable as their patio was closed due to a heavy rainstorm and everyone was seated inside.  We will absolutely be back and I encourage other vegan foodies to check this place out.",

My boyfriend proposed to me at this beautiful place, and the entire night was magical and lovely.  In no small part due to the attentive and very knowledgeable staff.  We started with the cauliflower bisque and the clam chowder, which was heavenly.  Each course was a wonderful experience, and after the sea bass and perfect filet Mignon, he proposed.  They brought us champagne and dessert.  We had a lovely time!  Once we were leaving, we were serenaded by one of the staff that is also an opera singer!  He was amazing!   It was an absolutely beautiful night and we can't wait to experience it again. A perfect place to take the one you love.",

Food was awesome!! The Main Course was by far the best dishes of the meal but the others were quite good as well. We would definitely come back if there was a GRoupon or something like that. If it wasn't on a deal we agreed we probably wouldn't.  We liked it a tad better than Binkleys but not as much as Kai and its similarly priced. $250 for a couple with a couple of drinks.  Nice atmosphere for sure. Id probably wait until Fall and sit on the patio though. The inside spot we got was right by the door and the door opens and closes about 10x a minute so it was definitely HOT inside the restaurant.",

You got the soup, caprese salad, choice of lamb or tuna tartar, and 1 of 4 main course choices (sea bass, sirloin, chicken or beet gnocchi).  There wasn't a course where I wasn't wanting to lick my plate clean. The roasted cauliflower soup with white truffle oil was smooth and creamy and AMAZING (and I don't usually like soup). Caprese salad was fresh and light. The tuna tartar was fresh and had a great flavor with a bit of spice kick. The Chilean sea bass was flaky, fresh and just incredible. Again, I was willing to lick my plate after each course. For dessert, we split the chocolate flourless cake and couldn't have been happier. It was light, and served with fresh fruit.  Very nice cocktail and wine list. I had a nice Savignon Blanc that went well for both glasses. Yes it was very expensive. But the service reflected the price and the quality was well deserving. Our water glasses never dropped below half full. They were kind enough to spray to help get rid of the flies that were around (huge help).  Such a great place. Expensive? Yes. But well worth it.",

    "text": "It truly doesn't get any better than this. Having traveled the world for many years as something of a foodie I've rarely encountered a restaurant this close to perfect. Adjacent to its previous space the new location is a re-purposed professional building that has been beautifully appointed with all of the ambient touches you would expect in the finest of French restaurants. Upon entering we were treated like royalty by a staff that has been well schooled in the importance of the impressions they make. While we sere seated in luxurious comfort our waiter carefully explained the Monarch system which is a four course fixed price dinner priced according to the selected entree. Wine and dessert are extra, of course, as well as a few carefully selected and mouthwatering sides. Each diner in our party of four pretty much stayed with the same choices with a few exceptions. For openers we all tried the squash blossom relleno, unusual, delicious and not to be missed. For the second course there is a choice of a spring salad, which I'm told was excellent, and a yellow fin tuna crudo which I had and was nothing short of terrific. The third course was a choice between Heirloom Carrot Gnocchi and a pork roulade. I had the latter and it was a delicious warm-up for the main event. Three of us ordered the citrus crusted Chilean Sea bass and the other the crispy skin ora tuna. The tuna was reportedly outstanding. As for the sea bass, I can say that I have never been served a  more flavorful, just right sized and perfectly prepared piece of fish anywhere. The citrus crust was deliciously flavored and pleasantly crisp. The fish was soft and flaky, and I was sorry to see the last bit disappear off my plate. Dessert? Of course. There was a list of possibilities and being already stuffed we ordered one for each couple - a rum cake made in such a way that it is wonderful cake flavored with rum rather than the other way around. With a cup of delicious coffee it topped off the meal. The wine list is extensive. The connoisseur will not be disappointed. There are, however, many wines on this well-thought-out list that diners will find impressive and affordable. Honestly, this is the most complimentary restaurant review I've ever written so you would not be faulted for asking \"was there anything negative?\" Well, yes just one picky little thing. When our waiter served my second glass of wine from the carafe he had a plate in his right hand to deliver across the table. Instead of doing that first and coming around to face me as he should have done, he backhanded the carafe over my glass with his left hand and nevertheless made a perfect pour. In sommelier-land that maneuver is a no-no but I had to admire him for making it work. My conclusion is that if you have a special celebration or you are entertaining a very important guest or client Cafe Monarch is the place. In this town I don't believe you can do better.",

    "text": "Cafe Monarch is unlike any other dining establishment in the valley, other reviews have compared it to a secret garden and frankly that couldn't be a more appropriate comparison.  The atmosphere here is simply breathtaking.  It's the perfect location for anyone looking for a special intimate evening.  The sound of the water fountain, the flickering of the candle light, the beautiful and lush landscape is something out of a fairytale.   From my experience with most restaurants is that they either have a beautiful atmosphere or good food, rarely do you find both.  This is not the case here; this family owned and operated restaurant prides itself on offering diners the best dining experience possible. With a menu that changes weekly, they are able to offer diners a delicious meal that consists of fresh, organic, all natural seasonal ingredients. Owner Christian Lewkowicz is so passionate about offering diners such a well rounded experience, that He and all of his servers are currently training to become sommelier's, which as far as I know Cafe Monarch will be the only restaurant in the Valley with such training. Because the menu is always evolving, and the attention to detail; it's the perfect spot for anyone who considers themselves a foodie!   The particular evening that I dined there, We arrived a few minutes early.. So we sat outside and had a cocktail while we waited for our table to be ready.  I ordered the El Diablo which has Olmeca Altos Silver Tequila, Gran Marnier, Watermelon Fresca, Muddled Jalapeno, fresh lime, fresh lemon with a sugar-chili rim. It was delicious and I love that all of the ingredients were fresh, I highly recommend ordering it.   Once seated inside the restaurant - our server came by the table and explained what that evening's menu options were.  Never once throughout the entire meal did I feel rushed. Our server was friendly, engaging, well educated on the menu and wines offered and very discreet.    We were started off with a delicious amuse bouche of Steelhead pate with crispy wontons, It was delicious and a perfect way to start the meal.   The second course was an arugula salad with feta and red quinoa -  the portion was huge and the salad was perfectly balanced. I ordered the wine pairing with the meal, which I highly recommend. All of the wines offered on the pairing menu are not available on their regular wine list. The salad was paired with a beautiful French white Lorie wine by Domanie Du Lobard. It was the perfect pairing to the salad course, light and crisp with a little fruitiness.   For my entree I got the Sauteed Chilean Sea Bass, Crab-Edamame-Saffron Risotto, Petite Shaved Fennel-Onion Salad, Vanilla Bean-Lemon Beurre Blanc. I LOVE Chilean Sea Bass and it may have been the best sea bass I have had. The real stand out of the entire meal and a must have were the Seared \"Diver\" Scallops with Baby Spinach and Bourbon-Shallot Sauce which is well worth the $20.00 additional charge.  The entree was paired with a Greek wine Skouras Saint George Nemea.  I wasn't expecting a red wine to be a good pairing to the Sea Bass, but it complimented the flavors perfectly.   The desert was a shortbread with fresh berries which was paired with a delicious  Prosecco.   I thoroughly enjoyed my entire evening at Cafe Monarch and can't wait to dine here again in the future. For the quality of food and the price point ($65.00/pp and $30.00 for wine pairing) it will be apart of my regular rotation!",

They have heaters almost at at 1:2 table ratio so it's easy to stay warm despite the winter season.   The food is incredible. It is priced at $65/person for a 4 course meal + $30/person for wine tasting. The menu changes week to week but during my visit, I had sweet potato bisque, a fresh winter salad, filet mignon, and a rum cake. I was pleased with the wine pairings - the sommelier was clearly gifted in his trade and did a great job in enhancing the already perfect meal.   The service (our waiter: Bradley) is attentive but not overbearing - there wasn't a point during the meal that I needed to wave someone over. We had to wait a few minutes for our table, but the beautiful patio and cocktail menu made the time go by quickly. The owner was lovely and checked on us regularly. She apologized for the wait and made sure we had the best table in the courtyard.   This restaurant is really something special and I would recommend this place over and over again.",

The new building is drop dead gorgeous a perfect spot to celebrate any occasion . The food is always on point and rivals some Michelin Star restaurants we have dined at .     Last night it was sold out and quite busy . We had to wait a little longer then usual but we were enjoying the ambiance and night . The waiter took it upon himself to apologize for service and discount the bill . We never once complained but appreciated that level of service . We will be back again .  Must try restaurant !",

    "text": "Tried Cafe Monarch for the first time and it definitely met my expectations for delivering an experience. Very posh ambience and they deliver a fine dining experience.  My date and I ordered different main entrees and shared the small plates so we got to sample almost everything on the menu. All the food was well prepared and offered a wide range of flavors. My favorite was the filet empanada that we received as a gesture because we got sat to our table almost an hour after our reservation time (by the way the empanada was worth waiting for the table) and my second favorite was the lobster ravioli.  I would, however, not suggest the Wine Pairing. We both chose it thinking it would add to the dining experience and were not impressed with the selections. We typically do favor red wines so after the first 2 courses receiving white, asked for the next selection to be red and weren't taken seriously. The wine added $95/each to the bill and wasn't enjoyed. :(  I definitely recommend Cafe Monarch if you're celebrating a special occasion. We sat on the patio, the fall cool AZ nights made the candlelit dinner very romantic! Our final bill was $500 for the two of us so be ready for a splurge. I wouldn't go back, but it was worth trying once.",

Do the wine pairing even if you don't like white wines like I do. It helped me discover some whites I never thought to try that truly made the food more enjoyable.

We had possibly the best waiter I've ever had (can't remember his name, unfortunately) - extremely friendly, charismatic, knowledgeable, and just overall fun.  All of the food was amazing - ALL of it. Nothing specific to recommend. Get what sounds good to you and I promise it won't disappoint.

We were a party of 7 and were gathering at the front fountain to take a few pics before entering the restaurant, when a greeter noticed us and came out with a huge smile, grabbed a phone/camera and took our pics for us.   Walking through the restaurant was an experience unto itself!  The place is STUNNING!  I felt as if I were placed into a centuries old French Chateau.  We were seated out in the back courtyard and again, it was simply gorgeous.   Our waiter - Noah, was superb.  He did a fantastic job walking us through the menu and explaining each option in perfect detail.  Because we were celebrating 3 graduations and two birthdays, he brought us a round of complimentary champagne for a toast.  He later did the same with desert!   Our meals were absolutely incredible!! And the wine (a 2015 Louis Jadot Burgundy) was amazing! I can't say enough about Cafe Monarch.  Bravo to the owners, who have truly perfected the fine dining experience!!  All I can say is THANK YOU!",

We started with the Kamboucha Cauliflower soup.  It was incredible!  The soup was creamy and the bread they give with it was out of this world.  For the next course we each got the winter salad which was also outstanding.  The braised pork belly in there was delicious and the rest of the ingredients blended nicely together.  I would highly recommend both.  For the third course, we were a bit disappointed.  My brother got the Duck Breast (advised by our waiter) and I got the bolognese.  Compared to the first two courses which were booming with flavor we just did not find the duck it to be anything special (might just be preference).  The bolognese was good but really didn't stand out.  For the 4th (main) course we split the filet and seafood risotto.  The risotto was the winner.  We both loved it and were shocked by the huge portions of lobster, scallops, crab, etc.  The sauce they use was outstanding. Would highly recommend it! The filet was good, but had a lot of butter, and was definitely not as good as the risotto.  Our only disappointment of the night was that we showed up 10 min early for our reservation and then weren't seated for over 30 min.  I know it's a busy, highly rated restaurant but we were a bit frustrated standing around that long.  Overall it is definitely deserving of all of the praise it receives and I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area.",

Had to make a reservation because this place is usually fully booked. On their website it said renting the whole place for the night is also available. I am curious how much it'd be but I didnt figure out. I can only assume it will be something like a hundred grand. We ordered fillet mignon lobster as our main entree and ordered tuna bisque on fried sushi pieces, and foie gras. Foie gras was on point. Perfectly cooked and it literally melted in my mouth the moment I took a bite. The salmon salad my partner ordered was a little over cooked so had to send it back, and I would've felt bad if I was the only one eating but they came back with a new dish like a few seconds later. Perfect dining experience. Upscale and definitely romantic.",

The decor would probably have been considered elegant by Liberace. The service is \"team format', we had no less than 5 waiters. Once our main server learned we were not drinking we never saw him again. None of the other staff introduced themselves. The food was very average. Cold soup (it wasn't gazpacho) and the risotto was of average quality. Not a bad meal but hardly worth the price. Loud obnoxious drunks (doubtless treated as VIPs due to their large alcohol bill) ruined most of the evening and hardly made for a romantic ambience. There is no way this place is in the top 3 restaurants in Phoenix, let alone the US. All hype.",

It is pricey but worth every penny. The outdoor dining area is the prettiest I've ever been to. The lighting is perfect, there is a beautiful fireplace and The gardens are lovely. Even the bathroom is beautiful! The whole experience is amazing, from the attentive valet to the outstanding service and delicious food. I'm on a very restrictive diet, but the chef was able to modify every single course to fit my needs. And everything still tasted wonderful. Truly the best food. When they bring the food out, they describe everything on the plates. They also offer a wine pairing, where they match a glass of wine to each course. And, when you're there for a celebration, they give you each a glass of champagne when you arrive and after dinner, they bring out your dessert with fun sparklers and a little gift to take home.",

Every spot in the restaurant was thoughtfully decorated with its own unique charm, even the bathroom! The outside patio had lights to make the space feel intimate and romantic, and 1920s music playing to match the vibe of the restaurant.   The 4-course meal is excellent, I mean truly, every course is mouthwatering good! We started with cauliflower soup with white truffle oil drizzled on top, the perfect blend of flavors to start the meal! The main dish we got steak and Seabass - both are good but if I were to recommend one I'd go with steak, melts in your mouth, perfectly prepared, it'll rock your world!  All staff go out of their way to make the night feel special, they even brought my mom a cute little gift and free dessert for her birthday!

We had just relocated to Phoenix a few days before and I really wanted to make her birthday special since she would be away from family and friends. After arriving a Cafe Monarch, I knew this would be a special experience. Christopher, the chef/owner, greeted us warmly right away. Monica seated us and we sat outside on a perfect Sunday morning enjoying the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant. The concept was very simple: one sweet entree and one savory entree and your choice of beverages for one flat price that included taxes as well.  The beverages were refreshing, watermelon and orange aqua fresca and a fruity delicious herbal iced tea offering along with full-bodied coffee. Of course we ordered both a savory and a sweet entree. I was not prepared for how wonderful the food would be. It was simply divine. The quality of the ingredients was truly exceptional. I have never had prosciutto so thinly sliced and delicate in flavor. Not only did we eat some of the most wonderful food, we had the opportunity to share a wonderful conversation with Christopher. He was so warm and friendly and he went above and beyond to make my mother's birthday memorable.  I cannot wait to return for dinner because I know it will be yet another unforgettable experience.",

We both had the crostini, which was amazing--grilled pear, goat cheese, arugula, large pieces of toast, oranges, blueberries, and strawberries. Chris even gave me a complimentary glass of Prosecco to give cheer to my recent move to Scottsdale. The pricing was $20/person for breakfast. Well worth it. A great find.",

Our guest were blown away by the venue, food, and comfortable atmosphere ... not an easy thing to pull off with this crowd.  Calamari and shrimp ceviche, prosciutto with cantaloupe salad, pork loin ratatouille, and a dessert of fresh strawberries with sweet whipped cream over puff pastry drizzled with chocolate... it was perfect!  We brought cases of wine and champagne and we had a beautiful, fun wine bar. For an evening in mid May, the weather completely cooperated and we were able to dine on the front porch.  We had a wonderful time... as I was able to completely leave all the details to Chris with the complete confidence that it would be wonderful.  I was not disappointed.  We had a relaxed evening celebrating with friends and family. Thank you again, Christopher.",

But, I can witness that he doesn't have 8 arms either. He looks so chill that you assume he doesn't know the definition of stress. Jealous? Yea, I was. Back to dinner. It is a byob = awesome. Pre fixed dinner of $45/person. You need reservations for dinner. When you call he asks you your preferences. Chicken, meat, seafood any allergies etc. You come in and he first serves the appetizer. Mine was an assortment of vegetables (mushrooms, eggplant, pesto, tomatoes) and lots of goodness. The entree fish cakes with this sweet sauce. Dessert was AMAZING. Fruits like plums and berries over this cream and flaky crust. It was aromatic and sweet, but just the right amount. Chris is so sweet and makes you feel comfortable. The bathroom was cool looking too :)",

Chirstopher was still setting up when we got there, we were first in the restaurant, so we just sat and pulled a book off the wall and hung out.  So, not much to say that hasn't been said.  Not really a menu, there are a few items that he has prepared for the meal but anything can be customized to your liking.  I had a BLT on grilled bread with dates and barley salad that was probably the best i've ever eaten.  My wife had a roasted pear salad with red wine glaze and a huge hunk of quality blue cheese, and she added a chicken breast and he didn't bat an eye.  Every bite was so full of flavor.  The place itself is pretty small, and the chef prepares your food like 5 feet away, every table inside is essentially a chefs table.  You can talk with him and observe while he cooks, as long as its not too busy.  The atmosphere is awesome, books on the walls to check out, all kinds of pictures, and for me the open kitchen is the entertainment.  This place is cash only and BYOB, so be prepared.  We only went for lunch but looks like a perfect place to take a couple of bottles of wine and hang out for dinner.     This place was awesome, can't wait to go back.  Bring an open mind and a good dose of patience and i don't see how you couldn't love it.",

I must share my comments as I have to get the word as you don't know what you're missing out on if you don't go. I took my wife out for her birthday, wondering if it really lives up to the hype. Cutting to the chase, this was the best pea cold soup, salad, steak (she has the fish), and desert we have ever had, and we've been to some really nice restaurants. Sound crazy, but the even the coffee I had after the meal was delicious. So going back, we started off the whole evening with their own house mixed concoctions, which was really tasty. The atmosphere is what really caught our attention, as the local owners designed everything piece by piece. They pay attention to the details, making sure everybody was taken care of and everyone got paid that extra special attention we all crave for in a server. (I spoke with the owner and learned about the history of this place and how they re-designed this)  The couple next to us was celebrating their anniversary, and everybody who was celebrated something received a present from the restaurant. I wanted to post some pictures but they came out too dark as we went out to the patio afterwards to have another drink. Misters cooled us down---felt really good. Bottom line, if you want some REALLY good food and just good service, this is the place. Will be back soon. Thank you SO much for the great experience!",

I had the filet with Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoe puree and corn, outstanding. My husband had the salmon with rice pilaf, the salmon was cooked perfect. The last thing we had was dessert and I normally don't finish my dessert when ordered. We had a peach crepe with rum and vanilla gelato, it was outstanding! I think we both wanted to lick all of our plates, yes it was that good. I don't think I've had a meal that good in a long time. The staff was also wonderful and on top of things. Very nice!

The entire atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful and I took lots of pictures. It is one of the nicest decorated restaurants I've ever been to before, including the high-class ones that charge $300 per meal.  (Sry if this sound snobby, but hopefully this provides good frames of reference)  I sat in the garden outdoors and got a grilled cheese and tomato soup ($10) and a chocolate brownie with walnuts and strawberries ($7). The grilled cheese sandwich was the BEST grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had, and I've had tons and tons of them during my life. The crust was perfect for dipping into the tomato soup and there was at least 2 types of cheese. The tomato soup was spicy and had lots of minced garlic. One lady at the table next to me thought it was too spicy, but to me it was fantastic and was a welcome departure from the typical tomato soup (you know, the creamy, bland, salty campbells soup kind). The brownie was unique as well, not only was it beautiful to look at, but the brownie was moist and tasted like..CINNAMON! Dude, I've had fine pastries. I am a regular whole foods fiend, and I go all the time to local bakeries in my native DC area. I've gone to the most expensive and exclusive stores in Tokyo (Ginza district) to get desserts, and I've also eaten in Paris before as well at various boulangeries . The brownie here was one of the most memorable deserts I've ever had. I've NEVER expected cinnamon in a chocolate brownie!   Services was very attentive as well. I am recommending that everyone who goes to Scottsdale to visit this place! Absolutely some of the most delicious AND unique (this is important!!) American-style food you will ever have. They are cash only though, so please keep that in mind.",

My cocktail was over the top.  Everything was so full of flavor. It was like a circus of flavors!  The ambiance was so sweet with lit candles and sweet decor.  The customer service was wow!  At the end of our meal I was brought dessert and a lovely little birthday gift too. This has never happened at a birthday meal ever!  I can't wait to go back!  PS ask for Sam as your waiter.

Their knowledge of what they are placing in front of you and what is on the menu was remarkable. When it comes to the food, I'm still utterly speechless. The quality, the attention to detail, the taste... unbelievable. I've never had or savored food like this before.

    "text": "I, too, found Cafe Monarch on Yelp. Chef Chris and I played phone tag a few times, but we finally got reservations. My party of nine ended up getting Easter brunch, and for $20 we felt it was a great deal. We got a poached salmon salad (amazing dressing and fresh peas!) and a cashew chicken with Japanese black rice. They were served family style and delicious. The coffee, hibiscus iced tea,  and dessert course was also included in the price. Unfortunately we didn't take advantage of the BYO-champagne since we partied a little too much the previous night :)  Chef Chris came out after our meal to chat with us and he was hilarious! He is probably the only person who can get away with calling his guest an elitist cougar :) (Don't worry, it doesn't sound as bad as you think!)  This is a dining experience you should not miss. Take your time to enjoy the atmosphere (maybe eat in the patio area when it's cooler). I'm off to tell my friends in Phoenix to try it out, and I hope to visit Cafe Monarch if I'm ever back in the area.",

He started by bringing us sparkling wine to celebrate our special event.   We started with both soup selections - Cauliflower and Lobster Bisque - they were not the highlight of the meal as both were just fine. The winter salad was quite nice, nothing unique but the dressing and all the elements were very nice. The Lollipop Lamb was a double cut and was prepared perfectly and the Tempura King Prawn was too spicy and seemed out-of-place with the rest of the meal. We enjoyed the Filet MIgnon and Sea Bass for our entrees - both were outstanding.   We had no intention of getting dessert but, again, our waiter surprised us with the most amazing Rum Cake to share. This was a perfect end to an outstanding dinner!",

Each course was beautifully presented, unique, delicious. They don't include the vegetarian options on the menu but those were absolutely delicious as well, not an afterthought like at many places. The servers were knowledgable and went above and beyond to answer questions we had about the wine and food. They even were able to talk to us about different regions in France and their wines. Extremely professional, a truly romantic and classy experience. Menu changes frequently so we will definitely be back!",

I loved the large oyster mushrooms in the grain dish, the cauliflower truffle (i think it was the first course soup) had a very piney flavor and was most enjoyable.   My company was special and this was the perfect place for special.  The Owner was our server and we could tell how much he cared that everything was perfect! It was very relaxing and an enjoyable 2 1/2 hours that I wish could have lasted forever.  I hope I will have the pleasure of dining with the Monarchs again in the near future. love",

He is very knowledgeable and helpful and always available without being overbearing.   You'll notice I haven't said a thing about the food up to this point. The reason is this restaurant is as much about creating the perfect evening as it is about the food. It is people like Richard who fulfill that mission. Thank you Sir. We got lucky last night as he was with us one more time.  The food...I can't articulate how amazing the food is. Simply incredible!

We're in town from LA for a birthday/girls weekend and decided to try Cafe Monarch after seeing the name pop up a few times while doing restaurant research. Each of the 4 courses was absolutely delectable. I had the cauliflower soup (so good, I could have never imagined such a delicious soup when made of cauliflower!), king Ora salmon salad (exquisite), lobster ravioli (yum!), and the maple duck with the cherry glaze on the side (it was an excellent call for me personally to have the sauce on the side as it was too sweet for my liking and the dish has plenty of flavor from accompanying vegetables).  They brought out a gorgeous plate of desserts for my birthday and we topped it off the meal with Stag's Leap Artemis Cabernet. It was perhaps the best birthday dinner I've ever had. Our service was also impeccable (Samuel is fantastic). All around, a 5-star experience.",

They have options to pair with each dish but we chose to order a bottle instead. Unfortunately a bottle my date chose didn't quite work out. We both had a feeling it will take time but what we underestimated was how long it took before it became good. They transferred wine into decanter, but it took a long time for wine to become good. Around the time the main dish came, our wine started to taste where this wine should taste. They do have nice crystal wine glasses though..    They serve four course menu here. They had two options for the soup.  Soup was a bit too salty, we both didn't finish. Salad was very good, I especially enjoyed brussels sprouts. Flavor and texture was just right, I would have enjoyed larger portion of the salad. Nice presentation too with different colors.  Main dish was nicely done. I enjoyed my fish and his steak. Around this time, my wine tasted really good with oaky smell to it. When he looked at the menu, he knew I was going to order fish for my main dish so he chose this wine. It just took a long time.  Desert and service was just average. I enjoyed the ambiance more than anything.",

If you're looking for a romantic place, this is a great choice.  We had a tasting menu for NYE, everything was very good and well portioned out. The pace was very reasonable, the service was excellent with a very down to earth staff, and the food is cooked at a very high level. This is a lovey spot where I would love to go back and try more of their offerings.",

    "text": "So we had our wedding reception here and it was phenomenal. It was small, well as far as wedding receptions go, but everything went so smoothly, I couldn't have asked for anything else.  Christian and Philip were amazing, they were really accommodating, letting us check out the restaurant before making our reservation, and not even pushing us into making the reservation that night (even though we shot them an email the minute we got home saying we wanted in), having custom menus with the prices removed printed specially for us, and just being patient with all of our questions, and trust me, we had more than a few. They even let us drop off our decorations and cakes before they even opened for the day, which was a huge relief for me since I was afraid the cake would melt in the car as we went out to get our pictures taken before dinner.  The food itself was absolutely delicious - all our guests (and us too) were just blown away. In every dish, the flavors blended perfectly together and you really couldn't go wrong with any of the choices available for the 3rd and 4th courses. I cannot stress how many times, in between bites, my now husband kept saying he'd be taking me here for our anniversaries to come. And the presentation of each dish! Let's just say pretty much everyone at the table was taking pictures before digging in, though that got hard to do since we were getting a little too excited to try each dish as it came out.  The only thing I might have changed about the night was maybe our main waiter. Don't get me wrong, he did his job, but was just a little short with us. And this might have partially been my fault since I wanted things run a certain way and he didn't care to be told what to do, so I guess we just got off on the wrong foot. But at the table, in front of our guests, he did his job so I won't dwell too much on this.  All in all, amazing experience, and we're absolutely glad we chose Cafe Monarch for our reception!",

    "text": "Came here for Anniversary dinner with my wife. What a fantastic evening!  She is currently pregnant and neither of us has drank for the last 9 months so I can't comment on the cocktails or wine list sadly.  However the food and service were great.  Richard was amazing and knowledgeable.  He even comped our desert as a celebration of our anniversary and our new little one who will be here soon!   And when we said how good the agniloti was and we were sad we miss out on the Bolognese me brought us a little sample of the Bolognese (which was delicious...whoever makes the pasta knows what they are doing).   Courses came out on time and waters never empty.  Needs anticipated and fulfilled. Probably best service I've had in Phoenix.   The food:  first course.  Rock shrimp in a sweet sour chili sauce with cucumber, jalapeno and micro greens.  Clean, bright, well seasoned, balanced and perfectly cooked.  Cauliflower soup:  very flavorful and tasty with creamy smooth texture and a good garlic toast crouton. Only complaint was that the cauliflower flavor definitely go lost in all the rich creamy truffle flavor.  It was a great truffle soup but if you didn't tell me it was cauliflower I wouldn't have guessed.  Still really good though.    Second course:   Roasted beet salad.  Perfectly roasted beets, a smear of quality goat cheese, greens, agridolce cashews for crunch, a bit of honey, fresh greens and a balanced slightly sweet tart raspberry vinaigrette.  Definitely a well composed and executed salad  Third course:  crab cake.  Not bad.  Not greatest either.  Had bacon jam and corn puree with it.  It just ate sweet.  Sweet corn, sweet crab meat, sweet bacon jam.  Needed more Old Bay in crab cake, some heat or some citrus or both to balance it out. Hangar steak with butternut squash agnilloti, poblano crema and Pinot noir reduction.  Perfectly cooked steak, amazing agnilloti and balanced sauces that pulled it all together.  Great dish.   Fourth course:  seafood risotto.  Pretty good.  Lots of big plump fresh seafood all with the exception of one prawn perfectly cooked.  Risotto was good but not great.  Was on the verge of being over cooked and gummy but was ok.  Risotto also lacked a depth of seafood flavor, like it wasn't made with a seafood stock or the stock wasn't fully developed. Tomahawk pork chop was good.  Massive double chop cooked to a perfect medium.  Sauces were ok. Decent smoky flavor to the sauce.  The legume cassoulet and butternut squash kind of ended up being a muted/muddled component.  Not bad.  Not great.   We also did the octopus/chorizo add on. Two perfectly cooked octopus legs.  And I mean perfect!  Soft and tender but not mushy and not at all chewy.  Balanced heat and smoke with the pepper sauce and the chorizo.  Couldn't get it any better in Spain.  Spot in dish  Desert: flourless chocolate cake and vanilla bean ice cream with cream and fresh berries.  Rich decadent, full of flavor.  Great end to fantastic meal.    Overall definitely makes top 2 or 3 restaurants we've been too in Phoenix!",

We had a very knowledgeable and entertaining waitress, who treated us like gold. Everything was prepared properly, arrived promptly, and tasted amazing. The ambiance is upscale, but not snobby or unaccommodating in anyway. I would definitely return.",

My bf ordered a drink and I told him I needed another minute to decide...took him close to 10 min to come back. During that time, I could see him just standing around, but he never looked our way. We had told them it was an anniversary dinner, but it was poor service for a regular night out, much less a special occasion.  Food wise, the salad and soup were fantastic! But after that, everything was sub par.  We both highly preferred the food and service at Virtu down the road a few months prior when family was in town.",

We chose Monarch based upon reviewed as our special meal during our trip to Scottsdale from Portland (a foodie capital).  The ambiance is romantic, with everything taken into account--lighting, decor, table spacing, and temperature.  The service was excellent, with staff for every aspect of one's dining experience.  The food, oh the food. This is a prix fix menu and I generally shy away from these because I don't eat red meat and I like to select my own food. You cannot go wrong with Monarch's chef. I'm not going to describe anything we ate because I wanted to savor the experience rather than take photos or notes. I will say that the chef pays particular attention to multiple complementary flavors and textures in each dish. Every bite is sublime; there is so much going on in your mouth.  If I lived here, this is the restaurant I would bring/send guests to to impress them with the cuisine of my town.",

This place is breathtaking. You have to make reservations if you want to come here and you have to request the outdoor seating as it was like a fairytale atmosphere. I mean I was blown away by the outdoor decor, it truly was a magical experience. They also really make you feel special. Honestly, one of the most beautiful restaurant experiences I've ever had and I've eaten all around the world. This will always be memorable for me.  This is a pre fix menu which isn't always my favorite. I have to say I loved 90% of everything brought out including the squash soup, their salad. A few other appetizers were just okay for me but nothing was horrible. The stand out of the night was my filet mignon as the server told us their cows get the royal treatment and you could tell. The meat just melted in your mouth and it was one of the better filets I've had for sure.   They knew it was my birthday so they brought out a little birthday treat (complimentary) with a sparkler that blew out, it was just beautiful and hats off to the staff for making everyone feel special at a place like this. They also gave me a little trinket to take home which I thought was also very sweet. This was definitely an experience I will never forget and not only for the delicious food, outstanding service but mostly for that magical, one of a kind atmosphere. So happy the weather was perfect for us to sit outside. Would love to return someday again!",

Tracy's review was right on the money when she described this place as being invited to your friend's house for a home cooked meal.  (If your friend was a fantastic chef and host!)  Don't forget to bring a nice bottle of wine to share, as this place is strictly BYOB.   Chris, while busy, was a fantastic host/chef and catered to our every need.  (Even tossing out our corking fee - Thx Chris!)  Be sure to make reservations well in advance, it fills up quick because the place is the size of your living room, but it is well worth any wait you may have.  Be warned though, going here is an all nite event - do not make plans for anything later in the evening!  (And if you do, you will be prepared to cancel them all at first bite -  it's that good!)

Cons - Your meal is influenced by other people's food preferences.  I took a large group of out of town visitors to Cafe Monarch because I read such great reviews on Yelp.  Reservations are key to dining here.  When you make your reservation, you need to provide Christopher with your food preferences and he whips up a meal for your group based on what you tell him you can't eat.  It's definitely not a place for picky eaters.  The meal he created was good and made me want to come back to see what he'd make the next time.  Be forewarned, this was a 2-3 hour dining experience so don't expect to dine and dash.",

    "text": "Cafe Monarch was to be the highlight eating experience of the weekend that my sister and I spent in Scottsdale.  Based on all the reviews and awards that their website boasts, we were expecting something completely different.    1) We were seated behind the entry door to the restaurant eating area.  Since that door was the main entrance to not only the inside eating area but also the patio area, the door continually swung toward our table throughout our entire meal as waiters and patrons entered and exited.  It was very distracting.  And because my sister was sitting on the main aisle, her chair was continually bumped and knocked for the entire meal.  In fact, one time, one of the staff walked behind her w/ what appeared to be a silverware rack from a dishwasher filled w/ silverware and he whacked her chair so hard w/ it, I felt it on the other side of the table.  All she got was a mumbled \"sorry\".   2) When the waiter came to take our order, we asked about the vegetarian appetizer alternative to the blue fin tuna tartar.  We didn't specifically order the soup alternative but there must have been a miscommunication because the hostess arrived w/ 2 bowls of soup for us and when we said that we hadn't ordered that, she turned to return to the kitchen and the waiter rushed over to our table w/ a look of panic on his face, we explained and then he rushed after her.  She returned w/ the blue fin tuna tartar appetizer w/ the waiter following a close 2nd w/ the 2 bowls of soup again - saying the we were getting a \"2fer\" because the chef didn't want the soup to go to waste.  It was a nice gesture and the soup was delicious but the reactions led both of us to believe that the waiter was afraid for that soup to return to the kitchen.   3) After the salad course, we must have waited for over 30 minutes for our entrees. The waiter didn't check on us during this time.  The final straw was when we observed a table that had been seated AFTER us be served their entrees.  We called the waiter over and expressed our dissatisfaction.  He said that he would check and he came back and said that our meals were being \"plated\" momentarily.  After another 15 minutes, we figured that the term \"being plated\" must have meant that they were just starting to cook our food because we still hadn't been served.  Our entrees were finally served and the waiter came over and ultimately admitted that our ticket had fallen down in the kitchen and had gotten misplaced. Neither my sister nor I can remember any apology being given or any kind of offer to compensate us somehow for the delay and inconvenience such as a complimentary glass of wine.  I guess they figured that a \"free\" bowl of soup was enough.   4) Now that our entrees had been served we were both looking forward to them but that was not to be.  My sister had ordered the filet and had requested that it be cooked medium well.  Her meat was medium rare and she could only eat the edges of the meat. She was so disgusted and frustrated w/ the experience that she just wanted to get the check and leave.  She didn't even have dessert.  I had ordered the fish entree and it was OK.  I couldn't enjoy my meal because I knew my sister was so upset.   5) Not once did the waiter check on us after delivering our entrees.   6) All and all, it was nothing like others had described.  It cost us $90 EACH for a less than memorable experience for both food and service.  We conjectured the following: the atmosphere had been described as romantic but we were 2 middle aged women that were not drinking cocktails and ordering wine w/ dinner therefore we didn't deserve the same level of attention that we observed other tables getting.  There was a family of 5 and a large party of all women there at the same time as well as couples and we observed that they were well attended.  Word of caution - don't go if  a) you don't fit the \"standard\" for Cafe Monarch patrons; b) be seated at the 2-top table that sites behind the door and c) don't ask for your meat to be cooked medium well.  We won't be recommending Cafe Monarch to anyone that visits the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.",

That and the fact that I realized any way that I try to describe my two experiences at Cafe Monarch will come off as hyperbolic because it's just that damn good.  Chris is amazing and I'm honored to say that I have eaten his food. His coffee has chicory in it for the love of God. He understands balance of flavors, freshness and service. Above all else, service.   My first trip, I was solo and after chatting with me a bit, as I was leaving, he asked me to bring the kids next time.  So I did. I came on Sunday for brunch and brought my husband and my 8 (nearly 9) year old son and Chris spoiled him rotten.   For the person who checked that it was not for kids: Maybe not for entitled, bratty kids who do not know how to sit and entertain themselves for longer than an hour. But for polite, well behaved ones who understand and recognize what good food is? It's perfectly fine.   Again, I was encouraged to bring mine and Chris did not disappoint, they were like two peas in a pod. Chris was even impressed that my son already knew what kind of cheese he had scrambled into his eggs.   A lovely experience at a charming place with amazing food cooked by a talented man.  See? Hyperbolic...but True.",

    "text": "The BF found this place on Yelp and promptly made a reservation for a 10 person dinner. I was especially intrigued by the idea of unique menu semi catered to your preferences.   We arrived Sunday evening and was greeted (by name) by the owner/chef/one man show Chris. He told us that even though he was feeling under the weather, he was still going to serve us dinner and with a smile too!   I was amazed at his ability to make a meal even with 10 different taste preferences (vegetarian, no red meat, not too much cheese, etc etc. we were a picky bunch). We had this zesty pesto pasta, a really yummy herb spinach salad, some rib thing (grilled pear for me, the vegetarian), and frickin' DELICIOUS blueberry marscapone waffle dessert. Al that food + BYOB = happy, happy Peggy.  I totally recommend this place because of the great ambiance, personalized service, and the curiosity/mystery of not knowing exactly what you're going to be eating! Plus, Chris has a great personality to boot.  It's approx $40/person plus $10/cork fee. Cash only, so come prepared!  Oh and I highly recommend a reservation.",

I love that there is no menu and you get what you get. I make enough decisions every day and it just feels good to let the experts handle it!   The three course dinner was so amazing I took photos! The only thing I would love to see is chairs the are more comfortable. But hey when the food is so good the hard chairs don't seem like such a big deal.   Great job Chef Christopher!",

    "text": "Excellent meal and experience! I went here for dinner last night and truly had a wonderful time. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very romantic and relaxed. Christopher, the Chef & Owner, was also the server, bus boy, host and manager. He did it all and did it perfectly.   When I made the reservation he called me back to find out what kind of food we preferred and to find out if we had any food allergies. I told him seafood and beef and that we weren't picky eaters. He had a delicious shrimp and asparagus dish for me and a pork tenderloin in a beef and smoked chipotle bbq sauce for my boyfriend. Both were excellent! He even asked me what herbs I liked to prepare my shrimp entree with. Never been asked that before!  Our reservations was at 7:30pm and we didn't leave until 10pm. It was a long and very nice evening. The price for a three course dinner was $40pp and then $10 for the corkage fee. I don't know where else you can get a meal of this quality for the price.   It is officially one of my favorite restaurant's in the Valley and can't wait to return. Next time will be for the brunch I keep reading about. It'll be the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon.",

If you are not a 'foodie, you will either become one, or at the very least , leave lauding the chef's personal attention, the great waitstaff , cool vibe of dining in the kitchen or eating outside in the beautiful courtyard, and decor that makes you feel you are anywhere but Scottsdale.  If you are neither, than you should not have read this far, but should certainly give Cafe' Monarch a try, you will become both.  Thanks Chris for making me feel like a regular the first time there.

The Rib sauce had a slight tang, but was also rich and deep to the palette.  The chicken glaze was different and was so good and really could stop to think of what ingredient might have made its mightiness.  Home made mac-n-cheese yes please!  It was so good I ate almost the entire cup.   My family humiliated the giant plate of ribs and chicken without hesitation.  Delish!  A note on the regular season...  there is really no better place to get a meal, especially a romantic on,  this is the place.  Bring your own bottle of wine or two and get a 3 course meal in authentic fashion from Chris.  The price is ridicules for what you get.  In a good way I mean.  Visit it next year in September.

    "text": "I was in the area for a conference and Yelp led me to this lovely establishment.  I set a reservation for 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Chris asked if I had any allergies or foods that I didn't like. You care?  Awww.... My only request was no beets. He also asked if I had any time constraints. At least give yourself an hour here.   I ended up running late, but Chris assured me it was no problem.  I arrived and was kindly greeted by Chris and his staff of 2 (one of which was a trainee).  I chose to sit inside so I could see him cook.  The inside is small, intimate and quaint. The cooking area is off to side, but in a location where most diners can see Chris in action.    The first course was shredded cucumber noodles with chopped roma tomatoes, grated asiago cheese atop 2 toasted slices of baguette with olive oil.  The cucumber threw me off a little, but everything tasted fantastic together! The perfect blending of ingredients.  I probably coulda eaten another serving but thank goodness I didn't.  The second course was Shrimp cakes with green beans, black rice with carrots, purple cabbage, and zucchini, served with a sweet chili sauce.  There was a little kick on the finishing bites of the shrimp cakes. Nothing unbearable.  I wasn't a big fan of the green beans. But they were just plain.  The shrimp cakes with the black rice were wonderful. I got pretty full from the shrimp cake, but shamelessly finished the entire portion. The final course, dessert, was pumpkin bread pudding topped with glazed pear and toasted nuts with cranberry sauce on the side and a sprig of mint.  This portion was HUGE! I think I maybe took about 4 bites and just couldn't eat anymore. The dessert was delicious and I especially liked the glazed pear topping.  The food tasted very fresh. Chris mentioned that he had gone to the market earlier that day to prepare for dinner.    Service - The staff, to include Chris, was very attentive. About mid way through my dinner, 2 more couples arrived and decided to sit outside. A few minutes after the waitress seated them, Chris asked the waitress, \"Is everybody comfortable?\"  Really?!  If ain't customer service, then I don't know what is. Oh wait, yes I do. So I've paid my bill (only cash accepted; think it was around $65) and I stand up to leave. I walk over to Chris to thank him for a wonderful dining experience and ask if I can take his picture. He graciously obliges and takes a pic with me. After the pictures, I walk out the door and who should follow? Chris! He walked me to my car and even opened my door. If THAT'S not customer service, then I dunno what is!  I can't say enough about this little gem. I only wish Chris could split his time between AZ and DC. At least think about it, Chris?? :-p  I  If you ever find yourself near Scottsdale, make some time for Cafe Monarch. You won't be disappointed.",

Chris makes a point to get to know you a little more each time your there and last time we were there he even kept the place open late just chatting with us.

Usually, you don't hear a word about it to the end, so it took us both by surprise.  Our server was incredibly knowledgeable concerning wines, they didn't have a Malbec at the time but he served up two more delicious wines that made me completely forget about a Malbec (forever).  All the courses tasted amazing!  For the main course I had the filet mignon which was dynamite, talk about just perfectly cooked and exactly how I ordered.   My wife ordered the sea bass; during dinner I had just told her that I hated sea bass.  I tried hers for kicks, and again took me by surprise.  That's probably the best fish that I have ever tasted, and I am not a fan.  The servers added a special touch for the occasion, and overall this restaurant/experience was well worth it.  I will also say...it was 115 degree day (End of July), we had dinner around 7pm. The outdoor patio with the misters was still manageable, I barely noticed the surrounding heat.  I would say sit outside if you have the opportunity.   Thank you!",

    "text": "I feel I'm long overdue to write a review as it was Yelp that led me here.   My search words were \"romantic\" and \"candlelit\"...and for my dining companion's sake, I threw in \"vegan\".  This place delivered on all three counts. I only wish my date had measured up to the restaurant, but that's a different story...  They were able to accommodate us on very short notice, and were not fazed at all when I mentioned that one meal would need to be vegan. I knew it would be a little spendy, but I was ready for a reason to throw on the LBD and the boots, and to be fair, of course it costs more, it's not Olive Garden. (If you happen to love Olive Garden, don't take offense...apples and oranges...).  I had read previous reviews about the outdoor seating area, but unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately) it was raining that night and we had to eat inside. We mistakenly walked to the kitchen first, and I already loved it. We were *personally* greeted, and shown to our table. It has an intimate, warm feel, and there were only two other parties there.  I was in my little black dress, and others were a bit more casual yet no one seemed over or under dressed. The server wore jeans and a black dress shirt, and the whole place seemed \"casually elegant\" if that makes sense.  I ordered white wine, and my date ordered red. I am not a huge red wine drinker, I really wish I could remember what it was though-- (a Cab of some sort) because I came close to converting that night...:)  The food was amazing. The chef had prepared a vegan meal specifically for my date, and I had the lamb. Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was perfection. The portions were not huge, but the flavors more than made up for that, as it should be...:) I still ended up taking some of my home, and it made for a delicious snack the next day! The server was attentive and gave great recommendations on the wine, and the owner came out and chatted with us.He was extremely personable and you could tell he loved what he was doing. I will definitely be back...next time with a different date, lol!  Thanks for a fantastic dinner!",

    "text": "Full disclosure: After our last trip, which went awry (see the review), I got a phone call from the manager (owner?) apologizing for what went wrong, explaining that their chef had an emergency of sorts and needed to leave and someone else took over who did not do his job correctly. She said that she knew that this dinner was a total mess and that she wanted us to come back another night to try it again. I, of course, told her that was not necessary, but I appreciated the offer, but she insisted several times. That is how I found myself back there tonight.   Tonight's dinner was night and day different than the dinner we had two weeks ago. I know this may be slightly skewed since we had been asked back after having a not as good experience, but because of the nature of this restaurant (everyone gets the same food) I still think this experience was valid.   The patio continues to be beautiful, and tonight was a great night for the patio because it was cool, not cold, and the heaters were not necessary. The menu was a very good one, though not particularly suited to the husband and I (as we aren't generally fans of seafood and this menu was seafood heavy). Despite this, we enjoyed every bite of the meal.   We started with a lobster bisque. I was prepared not to like this, as I don't love lobster, but this was sooo good. Creamy, velvety, and not too fishy. It was served with a piece of toast that soaked up the broth...really good. Secondly, we had the same salad as the last time we were there....but it wasn't the same. It had the same components, but it was made correctly this time... last time it was just a piece of brie, with plain undressed arugula, plain nuts and a big piece of poached pear.... this time the salad was dressed perfectly, it had a thin slice of poached pear and a slice of poached apple and the brie was grilled (I think....)... it was so much better. For main dishes we had a filet topped with crab and a bearnaise sauce served with cheesy delicious potatoes, beets which were....beets, and nicely cooked asparagus and sea bass topped with cucumber and avocado served over red quinoa cooked with bacon, roasted carrots, and a delicious sauce (this was super flaky and delicious....the husband liked it better than the steak which is very unusual). Dessert was also tasty, it wasn't what it said it would be on the menu (was supposed to be chocolate espresso, but was a vanilla cake of sorts with several different yummy sauces like caramel and chocolate and served with fresh fruit...the best part? The nuts... really well toasted and added just the right amount of flavor). We weren't offered/didn't get coffee, but that was ok. Additionally, we had our dinner over 1.5 hours... I feel like that is an appropriate amount of time for a coursed dinner, so that was a great improvement. After this experience, I can see us giving this restaurant another chance... we will be back!  PS After giving it some thought, I have concluded that the problem that we have experienced at this restaurant is largely due to communication. Had we been told there were issues in the kitchen and invited back another night from the beginning, that would have been acceptable (especially given the size of this operation and I do feel that it was not very fair that because of yelp we got a second shot but the other people there that night who most likely had the same experience probably didn't get the same treatment). Had we been informed at some point about menu changes, that would be ok too, but for some reason, things like this aren't disclosed at this restaurant. For example, the menu said chocolate dessert or pureed potatoes or whatever, if I were at a regular restaurant and ordered that, they would need to tell me, Oh I'm sorry, we've run out of that, but we do have something else. Why isn't that the case here? If there was one thing I think they should change, that would be it. Just a thought, but, as described, the food was far better last night and the follow up service was also very good, so they have that going for them",

If you are able, get a table on the patio... the greenery all around, candles and lanterns make for a relaxing atmosphere.    For Valentine's Day, the prix fixe menu had an amuse buche of lobster bisque, an arugula salad with poached pea, brie, sliced beet and a light dressing, and the option of either filet or sea bass for the entree.  We ordered one of each entree, which was the best decision.  We split both, and I honestly can't say which one I would have chosen if I'd had to.  I usually opt for steak over fish, but the sea bass was so tender and flavorful, and sitting on the bed of bacon jam with the side of avocado cucumber salad, it was delicious.  A major rival of the filet with crab meat and potatoes, which says a lot. Dessert was a Kahlua Chocolate Cake with strawberry coulis; I don't usually love chocolate cake if it's too rich, but this one struck the right balance.    We had a sparkling wine with dinner, with the cucumber infused water.  It takes a lot to make me enjoy plain water, but infusing it with just about anything will do it!    Finally, the service was top-notch.  Everyone here was professional and classy, and made us feel important and classy as well.  It was a wonderful experience and wonderful food... it definitely makes the list for great spots for a romantic or special occasion dinner.",

    "text": "I'm not a picky reviewer, so I don't give an establishment a 3 Star rating on a whim.  We read many glowing reviews of Cafe Monarch so we decided to give it a try.   Our first (more about that later) waiter was pleasant and took our order and my wife ordered the wine pairing. I don't drink so I just ordered soda.   She said specifically that she was not a fan of white wines and in particular did not like Pinot Noir or Sauvignon Blanc.  The waiter said he would avoid those.  She enjoyed the first wine and the first food course was very good.  So far so good.  While we were eating our second course, another waiter showed up at our table and brought the next wine.  He did not introduce himself and he seemed ill at ease.  He poured the wine which was a Pinot Noir, exactly what my wife said she did not like or want.  We didn't make a big issue and kept eating.  We weren't sure what was going on but it became apparent that for some reason, our waiters had been switched.  Our original waiter was waiting on other tables and we now had a new waiter, but as I mentioned there was no transition, introduction, or whatever.  It was awkward, especially for a restaurant of this caliber.  Later, while we were eating another course, the waiter brought another wine.  Guess what?  This one was a Sauvignon Blanc.  The second of the wines my wife specifically said she did not want.   Later, our original waiter stopped by as we were waiting for the check and my wife mentioned the problem about the wines.  Either there was no communication between the waiters or they just didn't care.  The waiter's comment was something along the lines of \"Well, yes, you said you didn't want the Pinot Noir or the Sauvignon Blanc, but these are such exquisite wines you just have to like them!  To me that translated to, \"Hey, these are the wines we have for the wine pairing and that's what you are going to get, and if you don't like these wonderful wines that we have decided to serve you, then there must be something wrong with you.  When the total bill for two people is almost $400 for a meal and one wine pairing (again, I don't drink), I find that totally unacceptable. As a side note, our first waiter asked me if he should keep the soda coming and I said yes but that didn't happen so I finally had to flag a waiter down after 20 minutes or so to get another soda when mine was empty and I even put the empty glass at the edge of the table as a hint.  We won't be back.",

Amuse bouche soup course dazzled (white asparagus with zucchini crab roll and tomato jam). The salad was a burst of fresh flavors -- watermelon, arugula, beets, hazelnuts. Entrees of filet mignon and halibut were equally inventive and high quality ingredients. Flourless chocolate cake was a sweet finish. Candlelight and attentive service. Wonderful find in Scottsdale.

Food was delicious and portions were HUGE!  The restaurant itself was situated in a small house.  It was beautifully decorated with candles and had a beautiful courtyard with a warm fire to sit by between courses.  Our server was very intuitive and could tell that a near by table (obviously celebrating a birthday) was being a bit loud so offered a nice table in the courtyard under a heat lamp for us to enjoy our dessert in peace.   We were also able to meet Chef Chris who we could clearly tell was passionate about his restaurant and the wonderful menu he creates daily.  The amazing thing is that he makes all these creations with only hot plates and panini presses (no gas line to the building)!  Would certainly love to visit again next time we are in town.  Only thing I would suggest is some heavy drapes in the dining room to help dampen conversations.  Bottom line: great food, great staff, beautiful restaurant and an excellent value!",

I finally got a chance to visit this hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale on a Wednesday evening around 7pm. The ambiance itself was breathtaking. It is truly what I would  picture a hidden garden to be like lit with candles throughout the dining area. Seating is limited and you must call in advance. You have the option to be seated inside or outside and I would highly recommend you reserve a seat in the garden if you are looking for fireworks this place has to offer. It literally screams ROMANCE!!! As of now, there is about a 2 week wait to reserve seating on both Friday and Saturday.  My friend and I were blessed to have Christian Lewkowicz, the new owner of Cafe Monarch, wait on us throughout the evening. He provided us with a the history of how Cafe Monarch came to be, his vision, the personal touch he has made to the decor including his lovely display of his grandmother's paintings throughout the restaurant and the much more.   The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixed offerings. The portions are much larger than I thought they would be. I loved the idea of a pre-fixed menu, because it helps those who tend to choose the same thing every meal to live outside the box! Overall, the food was cooked to perfection and arrived at the right time every time:)   To end the night Christian Lewkowicz took his already over the top customer service to a whole new level and offered to give us a private tour of the kitchen, which was the icing on the cake. It was a much smaller set up than I imagined and it still amazes me how much work and creativity comes out of such a small space.  I am already planning my next visit for brunch with my girlfriends and look forward to another priceless experience:) Thanks Christian!",

The patio is adorable and the weather was perfect which made for a wonderful dining experience. Our waiter was very attentive and everything on the pre-fixe menu was to die for!

If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.  As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.  I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.  For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.  This is my new favorite place in the valley. I can't wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!",

Definitely one of the better dining experiences my wife and I have had in the four years we've been together.  For starters the owner of the place Christian was our server and was extremely knowledgeable about everything, pleasant and remarkably down to earth despite owning a highly successful restaurant in Scottsdale.  Probably attributed to the fact that he busted into the industry busing tables 15 years ago. They have a fixed menu that can literally change almost daily so they take all of the thinking out of it.  They even have a wine pairing for the fixed menu that isn't part of the normal wine list to make sure it is the perfect match.  No small detail goes unnoticed.  You just sit back and enjoy all of the amazing courses while enjoying some tasty and unique cocktails or vino.  I can't imagine having a bad experience at this place and despite always wanting to try new places, I would definitely come back here if we visit the Scottsdale area again.  Keep up the great work Christian!!",

We found this place on Yelp while in town for a conference and got to have a deliciously awesome lunch for under $30 for 2.    We had a roasted veggie crostini and shrimp+polenta.  Both were perfection. Again, only issue here was that we wanted to sit there for the rest of our vacation and eat everything Chef Chris makes.  Nonstop.  The space is truly special, as if you are eating in your friends rustic house while they are cooking you up a culinary masterpiece.  The lunch was unforgettable, and we'll have to make it back for hours of evening eating.",

We started with a butternut squash soup, then had some kind of fried polenta and greens salad, followed by filet mignon and flourless chocolate cake. I'm not sure how they do it, but the creativity of each dish and the thought that went into marrying all of the flavors and textures was impeccable. My husband and I both agreed, it was the BEST meal we've ever had.  We had a 5:30 reservation and were seated in the courtyard, which after our experience, is the only way to go! Simply beautiful with great ambiance. We would definitely return to Cafe Monarch!",

Your friend is a great host-- friendly and engaging, the setting is warm and welcoming-- an outdoor patio with trellises and a secret-nook feeling, and the food is divine-- full of flavor but never overpowering the main ingredients.   Well, that's what my friends and I experienced at Christopher's \"Cafe Monarch\" last night. From the moment I sat down, I forgot I was at a restaurant, and felt instead like Christopher had invited my friends and I over for dinner. He was a gracious host, and made sure all of our needs were met. The opening dish of grilled eggplant, buffalo mozzarella, pesto, and tomatoes really got my tastebuds going, and it didn't stop-- from the bonus dish of penne pasta in a creamy sauce with feta and chicken (which he shared with us as he was already making it for the group next to us), followed by pork tenderloin (the juiciest I've ever eaten!), and topped off by a dreamy dessert--  the sweetest strawberries with chocolate, bananas, and blackberry compote (you'll have to excuse me if I don't get the descriptions totally right-- I love food, but am not a total \"foodie\").  Anyway, I was just blown away by the whole experience. Christopher has it down perfectly-- and I am astounded that he does it all by himself. And I was amazed by how affordable this special experience this was! (Just make sure you bring cash- as I don't think Christopher takes credit cards)  Cafe Monarch is a magical place. It is obvious that this is the manifestation of Christopher's heart and soul! I can't wait to go back!",

There are only a handful of tables inside, and Chef Chris is able to give personal attention to each one. We were a little earlier than most of the rest of the folks, so we had the chance to sit and chat with him before he started cooking. Seriously? I'd go back just to hang out with the guy.   He prepared an absolutely fabulous meal. We started with a salad -- lots of greens, citrus, raisins, some tabbouleh and a little eggplant. Magnificent. The main course was ribs. I'll be honest.. I'm not really a ribs person.... but these were like, fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious ribs. Dessert included some of the richest chocolate that I've had in quite some time.   It's BYOB & cash only. And amazing.",

Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...  Just remember to bring cash",

Believe it or not, it is hard to chose between the two because they both sound so delicious! Indeed the food is delicious and consistently great.   Christopher makes dinner look easy as a one man show in the kitchen.  It is truly amazing!  Looking forward to our next dinner...better plan soon!

Dinner is by way of tasting menu, and wine pairing is available--I highly recommend adding the wine.  I will not copiously describe the food, but it was all wonderful.  My dessert had salted caramel in it, and I was over the moon.  Service was impeccable and made the evening even more enjoyable.  If you come for dinner, do not plan anything else for the evening and let this be your main event so you can soak in the lovely ambiance, great food, and let the servers dote on you.  Pricey yes, but well worth it.",

    "text": "This past weekend, my husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary with dinner at Cafe Monarch. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by courteous, professional, and welcoming staff. Everyone from the valet to wait staff go above and beyond in making your dining experience perfect.   If you are looking for a romantic dining experience, you need not look any further. Do not let the modest label-- 'Cafe'--fool you. This restaurant is elegant and sophisticated without being garish and kitschy. We were seated in their ivy-laced courtyard, and as the dark hues of early evening blanketed the sky, the warm glow of candles--shimmering and dancing--perfectly set the stage for a wonderful evening.    Cafe Monarch's mostly locally sourced and seasonal menu offers up a four-course prix fixe meal and dessert. Our waiter, Jamar, was knowledgeable and helpful in explaining each course selection. Each course, from the soup to dessert, was artfully plated reflecting the care, finesse, and technique that went into each course. The delicate flavor profiles, as we navigated each course, did not overwhelm the palate--creating a deliciously delectable dining adventure.   For the first course, the Roasted Cauliflower Soup was perfection overload. Simplistic, yet complex. The toasted pine nuts mingle well with the slight earthy notes from the black winter truffle--a truly comforting food selection. Second course, Pork Belly Salad did not disappoint with pork belly cooked to tender perfection paired with a roasted crab apple and Gruyere-potato fondue--a perfect match. For the third course, the Maine Lobster Ravioli delivered a beautifully prepared tender pasta that encases sweet lobster meat, which bathes in a delicate sauce, then topped with crispy parsnip chips--a pure food tease. Fourth course, Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast for myself and the Lamb Rack for my husband, and neither disappointed. The duck breast was succulent and was served with pillowy carrot gnocchi, snap peas, wild mushrooms, and a sauce that tied it all together while allowing each element of the dish to retain its flavors. The lamb rack cut like butter.    For our special celebration, the chef sent out a few complimentary courses during our meal--the Ora King Salmon and the Prime Tenderloin Wellington. Both dishes continued to live up to an amazing foodie experience for my husband and myself. Our meal ended with dessert--Chocolate Flourless Cake. The decadent chocolate cake is complemented by raspberry coulis, creamy vanilla gelato, and fresh berries.   Cafe Monarch lived up to their reputation, and by the end of our dining adventure, they gained two new fans. Thank you for a wonderful anniversary dinner.",

My hubby loves Louis the XIII, and was pleased to know they had it. He enjoyed the presentation, & of course the cognac. The only negative I have about this restaurant was the deserts.

Granted it was a rainy and chilly night by Scottsdale standards but for the prices they charge they should not have had people sit outside. The table next to us was directly in the rain and they actually tried to sit 2 other couples there and then offered to move them once they both complained. There were not enough heaters and they tried to accommodate people with blankets. The food came out warm but it got cold quickly and was not enjoyable. The service as always was 5 stars but the food wasn't as impressive as we remembered. The brown butter cake was dry and the creme brulee had a flaky crust and barely any creme. We did the wine pairing and the wines were good but I guess at $100/person for the wine pairing it should have been good and they did give you a nice pour. Our total bill was $700 was it worth that, no. Would we return, sadly no.",

We were told the menu is constantly changing but among the courses we had that night some of our favorites were:  Yellow Tomato Gazpacho Bucatini ai Frutti di Mare Foi Gras Lamb Rack Pork Roulade  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The staff even had a special appetizer made for one member of our party because they were between choices on what to order. He said he'd \"surprise\" her and the appetizer ended up being delicious! They were extremely accommodating and the portions were also pretty decent sized considering it being a restaurant on the upscale side.  Would definitely come again!",

    "text": "Cafe Monarch is a fine Dinning Restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale. This is a multi award winning restaurant. Voted best romantic restaurant in the country by Yelp....Voted Number ONE Restaurant of Scottsdale by Tripadvisor out of 956 restaurants (in 2018). This is a reservation ONLY restaurant. Walk ins are not accepted. They offer fixed priced four course dinners that run at 2018 prices of between $80-$140.00. Wine pairing runs around $95.00 a person or you can purchase cocktails or bottles of wine. We thought the bottle pricing was a reasonable mark up. They only marked up the pricing less than half on our bottle and many places usually mark up the prices much more than that. The menu changes every other week so it's unlikely you will be able to try what I tried.  To cut a long story short.........  Atmosphere is amazing.....if weather is nice you might want to request patio dining in your reservation.  Service was very professional and servers are trained in sommelier training.  The food is mostly very detailed and high quality.   If they offer the Squash Blossom Relleno - GET IT......It was one of the very best things I tried anywhere. Very Complex and full of textures...so flavorful....wish I could eat a plate of them.  Another favorite of the evening was the Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo.......Really Great......full of flavors.  The dirt......Chairs inside are not so comfortable. Springs are broken and chairs are in need of repair or replacement.  More DIRT.....Not a fan of the Bananas Foster bread pudding....so much so I might never order dessert here again...Very dense, not sweet, unripe bananas.....  A most lovely dinner....not perfect....but for the most part if I ignore the dessert ...then very good -  to -  exceptional.  4.5 stars",

    "text": "OH. MY. GOD!!!  Probably one of the best, if not THE best restaurant I've ever been to. My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and it was absolutely wonderful. For the first 3 courses there's a choice between two options, and we each ordered something different so we got to sample a little of everything. What especially stood out to me was the roasted cauliflower soup - I could eat a bucket full of it and I'd be a happy camper. Even the water was excellent and refreshing, with a hint of cucumber and mint!  For the 4th/main course we ordered the same thing, which was a risotto accompanied with an assortment of seafood, and this is where my only complaint comes in - the crab leg that came with it is served still in half a shell, so it's a bit of work to separate the meat from the shell. But even so, that wasn't remotely enough to tarnish the amazing night.  The dessert was especially spectacular, serving my flourless chocolate cake with sparklers and a little trinket box as a birthday gift!   And the service, oh wow - we had multiple different servers stopping by our tables for various things like bringing drinks, clearing plates, etc., but all of them were absolutely exceptional! All friendly, polite, informative, quick to answer any questions, and really seemed intent on making sure we both had a wonderful time and that I had a happy birthday. Our anniversary is coming up soon, so I've been not-so-subtly dropping hints to my boyfriend that we should go back... ;D",

    "text": "I couldn't believe my luck when a friend of mine received a gift card to Cafe Monarch and invited me as one of her guests; this place has been on my list to check out forever, but it's hard to treat yo'self to extra fancy meals when you're ballin' on a budget. Our party was greeted by no less than 6 staff members between the front door and the beautiful patio where we enjoyed our meal. The ambience was very romantic yet cozy, with globe lights strung across the whole patio and small lanterns on each table.  Because we had 4 with us, we decided to divide and conquer the menu, so we could try as many different things as we could. My first course choice was the Squash Blossom Relleno, oozing with melty cheese and poblano and deep fried, served with pickled onions and a black bean puree. All of the flavors paired perfectly, and the textural differences between the melting cheese and deep fried crunchy exterior was mind-numbing. My friends chose the Roasted Cauliflower Soup, which was also was fantastic. Just the right amount of truffle oil.  My second course choice was the Jumbo Lump Crab Salad, which was a crab cake with an adorable salad housed inside of a baby romaine heart to the side. It was the best crab cake I've ever had in my entire life (shh, don't tell my fella's parents, who hail from Baltimore and regularly throw crab fests). With huge lumps of crab, it was wonderfully seasoned and perfectly accompanied by the salad, which was served with a delightful vinaigrette. I would've happily eaten 20 more of them. My friends opted for the Pork Belly, which was surprisingly large. I thought that it was just the slightest bit overcooked, but it was still incredibly tasty.   I ended up going with the Hanger Steak for round 3, which was phenomenal. It was cooked to medium-rare perfection, served with asparagus slices, a bechamel, and pesto. It was the perfect final appetizer to get me stoked before the main course. My friends who chose the Yellowfin Crudo were obsessed with theirs as well. The tuna was incredible, served with aioli and atop a delightful rice cake; crispy on the outside, but the perfect chewy interior.  By the time the main course came around, we were all so excited that we could hardly keep control over our limbs. A real sucker for well-prepared Rack of Lamb, that was my fourth course choice. It was cooked phenomenally, and came with a huge serving. I'm very picky about my lamb, usually opting to only order it at French places, as that's how I've found I prefer it seasoned. So, while prepared very well and served with excellent pairings, the seasoning used here was not my favorite flavor in combination with lamb. That being said, I can't fault them for my own picky tastes. One friend went with the Bucatini, pasta with a variety of tasty sea creatures. The pasta was served with a cheesy cream sauce which complimented the seafood very well. The one small point I had against it was that the scallop was just a bit salty, though not too bad when paired with the noodles. My other friend had the Cast Iron Filet Mignon, which was to die for. I'm a big steak gal, and this was one of the best steaks I've ever encountered; the cast iron left the exterior of the steak wonderfully crispy, without drying out the interior at all. Each bite was like heaven, especially when paired with the scalloped potatoes (which happen to be my favorite way to consume potatoes--though let's be honest, there's no bad way). Our last friend had the Surf and Turf Trio which was in short, perfection. A smaller piece of filet mignon, served next to lobster ravioli and the Chilean sea bass. I only sampled the sea bass off her ate, but it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Needless to say, we were all bursting at the seams full with the completion of our fourth course.   Because we were also celebrating two birthdays in our party, the restaurant treated us to their most popular desserts, complete with sparklers and a small gift for the birthday gals. We had the flourless chocolate cake and the rum cake, both of which were amazing in their own accord. I lean a little more towards the rum cake, myself.  We had impeccable service throughout the entire evening, with people available at all times should we have any questions, and regular check-ins to confirm we were enjoying our meal. All of the food runners (they probably have a fancier title at such a fancy place) were very well informed about all of our dishes, providing detailed descriptions with each delivery. My water glass never even reached the halfway point before being refilled, and all the staff were all smiles throughout the evening. The stunning service I think is what truly put the meal over the top.   For anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion, or perhaps just looking to splurge on a fantastic meal, I highly recommend Cafe Monarch. Everything was spectacular from top to bottom, and it was a stellar experience throughout--and we'd know, we spent 2.5 hours here :)",

We had to wait a half hour at the bar for a table. Sitting at the corner edge of the bar next to the work station,  our amuse bouche was brought out without any silverware. Lovely way to start our experience - awkwardly at a bar as if it were a pub. When they finally do seat us, they can't accommodate outside and stick us in the corner inside. When I asked to wait for a seat outside, I was told it would be over another half hour wait - meanwhile ppl outside got up and left 10 - 15 minutes later and the table wasn't seated again that night. Glad I reserved so far in advance and let them know it was a special occasion. Wish I could take the night back - for this price not worth the experience we had. Also, portions were tiny and dishes were hit or miss - either delicious or meh. You're better off a Sel, down the block which is a lovely restaurant that the ex-executive chef opened on his own. We ate there the night before and had I known what to expect, we would have made it 2 nights in a row.",

The menu changes weekly to reflect the best seasonal ingredients so that always keeps things exciting.i don't even know how to explain the interior, quaint, and almost like a cabin with lots of vintage chandeliers, mirrors, paintings and more, it is beautiful. Everything about the interior was perfect. My friend and I selected halibut and filet as our entrees. Each were outstanding in their own ways. The filet had a perfect sear and was wonderfully tender on the inside. The halibut had a number of flavor layers that went together well. We thoroughly enjoyed each course. The price is very reasonable, a $65 prix fixe plus alcohol. We were also honored to meet the chef Brandon on our way out. Definitely make this a stop if in the area.",

    "text": "*UPDATE*: The management of Monarch called me and stated that they were sorry about my experience and they were going to try and make amends. It has been 4 months since our conversation & no follow up has happened. The customer service the Monarch is still providing 6 months later is still ONE STAR. I still recommend NOT to dine at Monarch. There are multiple high end dinning experiences within a 5 minutes that provide a much better dinning experience.  Original Review: This was not the place to have an anniversary dinner. I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance asking for the most romantic romantic table they had available. We were put in a main walkway next to where all the wait staff was talking about the customers. The food was good but not memorable. Your bill will be $300 minimum waking out the door and you have to have certain expectations. Cafe Monarch did not deliver tonight. Siting at Cafe Monarch tonight felt like another table at an expensive restaurant in Scottsdale instead of an dinning & memorable experience to remember for a life time. There are much better romantic alternatives in the area.",

Shown to our table which was on the patio and so romantic.  Offered water right away with choice of bottled or house water with hint of cucumber. Given our menus. Our waiter Chris cane to table and explained every item on menu. Also told us the reason for changing menu is so chef can use freshest ingredients. First course we both had  Manila Clam Chowder.   Which was beyond excellent.                 Had a little bit of spice which made it, to my        taste buds anyway. The best I have ever had. Next-  Wintersalad.  -  salad was fantastic also.   Tempura King Tiger Prawn - sweet and spicy   Chilean Sea Bass- melted in your mouth   Anniversery Dessert-  Strawberry Cheesecake   Everyone was attentive. Soft music. Candlelight. Roses on each table.   Bill came. And yes it was high. But it was worth it. We could not afford to eat here more then once a year. But if you have a special occasion coming up. This place can't be beat. My husband and I go to a special restaurant every year for our anniversary and this was by far the best.  Thank you for a memorable night staff of Cafe Monarch !!!!",

What to do this year with Binkleys closed?  I'm so thankful I found Cafe Monarch!  Of course the beautiful outside courtyard made the night start off on a great note.  I mentioned in making my reservation that we were celebrating and it was obvious that the staff paid attention.  From the greeting at the door to the quiet table in the corner and the unexpected dessert served at the end of the meal our anniversary was part of the service.  And the meal--- wow. Delicious. Every course was perfectly prepared and had layers of flavors. That salad?!  Package it up and let me take it home!  So tasty.  When you order a prixe fix meal sometimes you worry the servings may be skimpy.  Not at Cafe Monarch. Every course satisfied your taste buds, filled you up without making you feel over stuffed.  We may have missed our annual trip to Cave Creek but we were so very happy with our visit to the Arts district!",

From the light canopy on the patio to the romantic individual bistro tables, to the well-educated servers and wine sommelier. We visited for the first time for a birthday dinner (table for 2) and the experience lived up to the high expectations we had. The menu and wine pairings were *INCREDIBLE*. Our server, Chris, was very attentive, friendly and relatable, which made it that much more enjoyable. Be sure to book a reservation because you can't expect to just waltz in to the top Scottsdale restaurant and grab a table any night you want. It's worth the wait, and well worth the price!",

My friend and I shared bites and her filet was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Tender, moist and perfectly prepared. Standouts for me were the Tuna Tartar and Halibut.

He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.  After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account.   Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.

    "text": "Cafe Monarch is a culinary experience. Unlike any other and absolutely extraordinary.   We sat inside, I think in the \"kitchen area\" where you can watch the chef/owner create his masterpieces. It was really cool to watch the owner perform his magic and to watch the joy he got out of cooking. The food had so much flavor and the way he incorporated the different ingredients amazed me, some of the ingredients didn't sound like they would taste good, but somehow they worked together and our taste buds exploded. Absolutely delicious! Cafe Monarch is also very accommodating, if you have allergies or you're a vegan (something along those lines!) he will gladly make the meal to fit your needs (just make sure to call ahead, especially if you're with a big party).   We didn't dine on the patio because it was like 30 degrees outside (Christmas time), but the patio is really awesome. It's really romantic and charming and next time I go there, I will make sure to enjoy the patio.   If you're a foodie and you love tasting new, exciting food, you HAVE to try this place. It is an experience you will never forget. Simply wonderful.   5 Stars for atmosphere, service and of course the FOOD!",

My 7 yr old grandson became interested in cooking after watching Master Chef Junior.  The staff welcomed him and explained the ingredients in the dish, we tried to identify the different flavors and he was completely awestruck, declaring it a five star restaurant-- which we all agree with.  Chef Brandon came out and introduced himself, Scott's service was perfect -- attentive and helpful, and the food was simply fabulous. Carol S.",

It is really pricey, and it's unfortunate that one needs to spend this much money to have a quality meal in Scottsdale. The dishes were excellent and well plated. The wines were nice but not spectacular (not worth the $60 add-on to the pre-fixe menu). I would go back, but I'd go back a lot more if it were cheaper.",

The night we went, he had a waiter but that is because he had about 30 people in the place.  The food - two words, incredibly fresh.  We were lucky enough to sit at the bar by his kitchen and we got to watch him cook.  He has amazing organizational skills.  We started out with roasted peppers (garlic, rosemary, olive oil), arugula, proscittuo salad with toasted bread and freshly shred cheese.  There were three choices for the main course.  Chicken w/chimichurri sauce, salmon with capers, green onions in a white wine cream sauce and sliced filet mignon over chinese black rice.  The rice had green onions, italian sweet hot peppers and other spices in it.  He squeezed a fresh orange and orange zest over the steak and then surrounded it with thai chile sauce.  The combination of flavors were incredible.  Dessert was a napolean puff pastry with lemon cream, topped with tons of fresh blue and blackberries, fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar, etc.    Unfortunately, he was so busy that we didn't get to talk to him too much, which based on other reviews, was a highlight.   We will definitely go back.  This is a treat!  We've come back to San Diego and told all of our friends about it.",

They called me on the day of and asked me if I wanted 9pm. I took it. This meal was priced at 100 per person.  We arrived but the lot was full so we parked on the street. During the walk to the restaurant I realized we had to walk on the street for part of the way(no sidewalk, just dirt) and there is a 7-eleven about 500 feet away. The place itself is a converted house of so it seems. We were early for our \"reservation\" but were seated 30 minutes after the appointed time. We were then seated. I noticed not many people were dressed for a special occasion as we were. The place was crowded and were were seated very close to others. The was no intimacy. The staff and food were excellent. We were offered side dishes but were not informed of the cost so we thought they were a part of the four course meal.  In total, the bill was 300.00 including tip. All in all, I would not come back for valentines day but perhaps for a non-special occasion.  This is due to the location, and the cattle-like feeling I felt not being able to justify the cost.",

I visited this past week and they had an amazing butternut squash soup, excellent salad and then for me the best part was one of the best entrees I've ever had! Polenta lasagna with portobello, spinach, tomato jam and delicious, fresh mozzarella....then when I didn't think it could get any better, the DESSERT was INCREDIBLE!!  Rum cake with salted caramel gelato....AWESOME.  Keep up the amazing work, Cafe Monarch! I hope to return to Scottsdale soon so I can visit again.",

    "text": "Even though I didn't get a chance to eat here on my recent trip, Chris earned me as a fan when I stopped by.   We'd just checked out of the Valley Ho and were heading to the Fairmont when I noticed the sign for Cafe Monarch. Having read all the great reviews, we pulled into the parking lot so I could jump out and make reservations for later in our stay.  I instantly liked the look of the place: cute, cozy little house with some porch seating. But I was still taken aback when I walked in and realized the main room was seating and open kitchen combined--in a very small space. Chris, partially hidden behind kitchen racks, greeted me right away even though he was clearly busy. I explained that I wished to make reservations for a friend's birthday on Monday. He said they're closed Monday through Wednesday (the remainder of our time in town), as he plated some amazing-looking salmon on a bed of greens. I think I looked really sad (mostly because I just wanted to grab one of those plates of salmon and dig in), so he said he was really sorry but he hoped we'd come back when next in Scottsdale.  You know I will, Chris. I'm just worried that it will be even harder to get a table next time! ;)  Note: I also asked for a menu to take with me, but Chris explained that there's never a set menu since he changes it daily, depending on which fresh ingredients he can source.",

There was not a single course that we thought was superb and the limited number of options was frustrating.  We actually went to another restaurant immediately afterwards and had a proper dinner because neither of us liked our food and barely ate anything.  The room is also extremely small and you feel as though you are sitting on top of everyone else as the tables are all pushed very close together.  Needless to say, we will not be returning and would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "My goodness! Where are these reviews coming from?? A PR company? I've seen such positive press on this restaurant that when my husband tried to make a reservation and they told him that we needed to wait 3 weeks and  bring two friends since they only had a four top I was still excited to go. Disappointed. One, you pay a cork fee for your wine but the waiters are nowhere to be found to pour it. Not ONCE. Two, the decor was sterile at best. It was like modern looking office depot desks placed in a warehouse in some parts and then fake pine needles and mirrors in another. Kind of 'off'. Maybe they need to consult a decorator. Three, although we were told to bring two people since there were no two tops, there were 2 of them just in our little room alone not even including the front area. FOOD: You had no choice of appetizers or desert. One choice.  For the entree you got to choose between fish and meat but when we ordered the meat they didn't even ask how we liked it cooked. It was all average. AND, the reviews all tout how involved the owner is in choosing the meals but we saw no hide or hair of him until we were in the parking lot ready to leave.  Small asides: I asked for black napkins. They had them but they were wet. Yup. Wet. And when we decided to take a doggy bag (yes, for the dog) they handed us a cardboard box and told us to have at it.   DISAPPOINTED. We will never ever ever ever ever go back again. The food was OK but nothing to brag about. Considering they only have FOUR dishes in the whole restaurant I expected to be wowed. Not so.  Don't waste an evening out or your hard earned cash on this place. And I mean cash literally. They don't take credit cards.",

The soup was overly salty as was the salad dressing. The main courses were fine but I had to remind the waiter to bring me a glass of wine I had ordered. Dessert was fine but not a knock-out. These might be overlooked in a less costly place, but at these prices one does expect a higher standard.",

We were asked upon entering if we preferred to eat indoors or out -the indoors looked inviting and warm but as soon as we saw the tree and hanging light lined patio the choice was immediate (would not have been so much if the option had been outdoors overlooking the parking lot where some guests were seated).   After being seated, our waitstaff was friendly and attentive, pointing out we could either opt for the paired wine option with our meals or choose from the wine/cocktail list which all four members of my party selected to do.  All selections, except the main course - which consisted of  meat, seafood or pasta -were pre-set and did not disappoint in the least although my friend's husband felt the butternut-squash ginger soup - with maple glazed prosciutto garnished with pumpkin seeds - was a bit on the sweet side.  This was followed by a locally produced arugula and beet salad with blue cheese and plum prior to our main courses. Our companions devoured their seafood selections and my husband and I our filet mignon, cooked to perfection medium-rare as ordered.  The meal was topped off by dark rum cake with toasted pecan butterscotch, just the right proportion.  We'd have liked to have been offered beverages to accompany dessert, however, once we asked our waiter for our choices they were promptly delivered although my first pot of tea was lukewarm and had to be replaced, with a reminder to bring a fresh cup.  Still, such an oversight did not detract from our overall enjoyment of the evening. If not for the rather high price of the evening, we'd be back sooner rather than later -- but we will definitely return.",

We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.  The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again.",

We sat outside, and the atmosphere was amazing, reminding us quite a bit of a small restaurant we would find within a niche of New York City, where we moved from. The menu was fixed, but every course was fresh and delicious. Only set back was the bill, where I caught an error in the pricing for wine that I ordered, but the waiter quickly resolved, and thanked me for identifying, as some customers don't address as quietly as I did. Definitely a near perfect romantic experience for the wife, but expect a sizable bill.",

From the adorable outdoor courtyard dining area, to the extremely attentive wait staff, CM really set the tone to provide a truly amazing doing experience. We were hopeful the food and wine would also be incredible. And it was!! The chef changes the menu each week, but I cannot believe there would ever be a bad meal at this place. We each did the wine pairing with our meals - so much fun and so great to try wines we normally wouldn't have ordered without the pairing. We tried three of the four entree options and all of them were phenomenal!  This was by far the most expensive dining experience we had while in Scottsdale, but totally worth it! We had spent enough on other meals that ended up being fairly terrible that I think we would have paid anything to eat fabulous food like this! If you have a special occasion to celebrate or just enjoy a True five stars dining experience, you should definitely check this place out when in Old Town!",

It is one of the top 10 dinners I have ever had.  Service, atmosphere and most importantly food was all impeccable.  The four course layout is perfect.  There are limited options in the course selections but there is easily options for anyone wanting to dine at this level.  Every dish was perfectly prepared and flavorful providing a dining experience equal to restaurants in New York and DC.  Event detail was covered down to even the table water which was a mint and cucumber water that was just right.  I had the paired wines that were well suited to the dishes.  When waiting for our courses the waiter gave me an extra pour of wine while we waited.  I had the Foie Gras which was an excellent addition to the perfectly prepared ribeye I had.  The waiter brought out the diver scallops as well which were awesome and demonstrated service and thought that was above beyond.  My wife went with the chicken which I would typically avoid at a restaurant but it too was unbelievable.  The atmosphere is romantic and perfectly executed and classy.  If you enjoy eating, and enjoy great service and environment this is the place to go in Phoenix, they do it all right.",

Loved the fact that you inform the chef of any food allergies or preferences in advance and you will get a unique menu of the day determined by the chef. I am still amazed at how this restaurant was only run by a one man team that evening, owner/chef/everything...Chris was amazing and he was very friendly, accommodating, and even took the time to chat with us.   We came with a group of 10. so you can imagine how many food preferences we had and how difficult it may have been to whip up a full blown meal for us. The food was amazing!   - Baked pesto chicken pasta was alright (initially a little undercooked, but it was re-cooked and brought out perfectly crispy on the edges).  - Spinach salad with yellow and red grape tomatoes: delicious and flavorful.  - BBQ rib/pork w/fingerling potatoes: There was a nice little kick to the sauce.  - Marscapone waffle with fresh berries: This was my favorite, crispy warm waffle with just the right amount of sweetness from the marcapone and berry sauce. Divine!   Good food, great environment, and a wonderful way to catch up with friends and the fact of not know what dish would be next/taste was a nice little conversation starter for everyone. I am intrigued to come back and see what type of different dishes would be served. I definitely recommend checking this restaurant out.   P.S. Reservations required and CASH ONLY!",

If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list.  Cafe Monarch is great and sure has found a niche that it thrives well in.  Very out of the ordinary with the owner holding the duties of chef/hostess/busser/and server, but he sure does it well.   Having a very limited menu posted near the front door proudly tells what the chef wants to serve his patrons for that day. There's only two to three items listed with little description.  I was a little confused myself as I like to understand and take control of things, but I soon realized this was something to let the creator(the chef) to have his way with.     His creations come with enormous skill glorifying fresh ingredients into a dish that can appeal to anyone's palette.  I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited, but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit.  Whatever it is, I will must certainly try it!   Two final matters, bring cash as the owner doesn't like give up the 3-5% the credit card companies like to charge for convenience of the American consumer.  Lastly, you will have to wait until September to enjoy this place as it is closed for the summer.",

He came and talked with us for about 10 minutes and was extremely friendly...and it wasn't just \"oh hey the weather is nice\" conversation, it was genuine and unexpected.

    "text": "WOW!  Ate here last Sunday with my wife and 2 friends. This is a unique experience, almost like sitting in your favorite chef's house and sitting by the kitchen while he prepares you a personal feast.   We all loved it - everything. I had a Chicken with some kind of amazing pepper reduction that reminded me of a Mole type of sauce, and the mashed potatoes on the side were just garlicky enough and a wonderful consistency - I ate every bite and I don't usually like potatoes!  Chis... the chef and owner... and server... and greeter... and entertainer and maitre d'...and busser... was working his butt off but in the end the whole experience was just fantastic and this guy is creating some genuine magic here at Monarch.  One little issue was I noticed a bit of smoke in the air from all the cooking just like 10 ft away - I think they could probably get a little heavier duty exhaust fan in the kitchen... But in a way it just reminded me of how close this experience comes to almost being at a chef's private home while he whips up a few favorites for his friends.   BYOB? Yup, and only $10 a bottle for corkage!  What a deal, and also respectful as most cities in the United States (except Phoenix) offer this as the rule rather than the exception. Smart!    The dessert was also fantastic - an entire plate for each guests filled with chocolate ganache, fresh whipped cream, a poached pear to die for...and delicate puff pastry.  Mmmm... We will be back, if we will be lucky enough to get a reservation in this soon to be \"impossible to get into\" little gem.",

    "text": "QUESTION: If you're in Arizona and can only do one thing, which do you choose:  (a) Gaze upon the Grand Canyon. (b) Hike the trails of Sedona. (c) Tour Kartchner Caverns (d) Dine at Cafe Monarch  Believe it or not, the answer is (d) and here's why.  The hole in the ground, the red rocks and the bat-cave have all been around for thousands of years, and will continue to be around for many lifetimes. You can see them anytime and they're not going anywhere.    Now we are all traveling mortals, placed on this earth for a finite time.  You, me, and Chris (the chef at Cafe Monarch) are no exception.  Now I wish all of us, including Chris (the waiter at Cafe Monarch) a long and prosperous life.  But lets face it; none of us know what our Creator has in store for us, and that includes Chris (the host at Cafe Monarch).  Also, we never know when the landlord is going to sell our shop's location to turn it into a Wal-Mart, and this goes for the place leased by Chris (the busboy at Cafe Monarch).  Finally, we never know where we're going to be in a few years.  For example, we could fall in love with someone special and move back to New York City and this includes Chris (the dishwasher at Cafe Monarch).  Let me put it to you another way... If Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in disappearing ink, wouldn't you rush off to see it?    Some works of art or natural beauty will last forever.  But when food is art it must be experienced (i.e. eaten) hot off the grill and whenever you can get it.  So when the medium of the 'genius-artist' is food, you have to grab every opportunity to experience the masterpiece.  Chris brings a passion to his cooking.  He tells us that cooking became a necessity as a child, but it was also his chosen form of creative outlet.  He has developed an intuitive ability to combine flavors, spices and textures.  He provides beautiful presentations that are layered with tastes... you and your pals will be guessing at the ingredients.  This \"artwork\" is tasty, healthy and generously portioned.  All for about 40 bucks plus a $10 corking fee.  Arizona is lucky to have Chris feeding a few selected diners who are smart enough to make reservations.  Go see (and eat) this man's art.",

Upon arrival, even for just a short wait for our table, we sat outside at a private table to have a cocktail and review the menu.  The outdoor courtyard is really lovely - dimly lit, romantic but lively, and surrounded by foliage (no street view).  The service was also excellent.  Always attentive, accommodating, very friendly, and prompt. We will most certainly be back! Thanks for a great experience!",

    "text": "I have been meaning to write a review about this place for quite sometime. We had our rehearsal dinner here back in April of 2009. The Chef was so amazing and so accommodating.   We were able to rent out the entire place for a private event, which isn't large to begin with but its very romantic and intimate. He created a wonderful menu for our guests upon our request which was different from any regular restaurant fair, and different from what we were serving at our reception. That was important to my husband and I as we had a lot of people from out of town attending and wanted to give them a great experience.  There were candles everywhere and beautiful flowers, it was just a great experience. I will admit, I was skeptical but it turned out to be a beautiful night.   The only reason I am giving this 4 stars, is if I remember correctly, it is cash only. If you are like me, you don't carry cash, like ever. And there is no set menu. Chef Chris cooks with local ingredients and the menu changes everyday.  But the food was great and the portion sizes were more than what I expected.   I believe they close for the summer, since most of the seating is outside so make reservations once they re-open! Also, come with an open mind and open palette. It's also BYOB so come prepared and you will have a great evening. Its nice to find a small, intimate place in such a busy, fast-paced metro area. It will feel like you are somewhere else!",

The atmosphere was quaint & charming~ the bathroom was marvelous- I could have stayed in there and just gone exploring. From start to finish, I could not stop saying, \"Yummm.\" From the roasted pine nuts cauliflower soup to the rum cake- oh, heavenly. Christian, our food connoisseur was so amazingly attentive. Towards the end, I was given a birthday present- a beautifully wrapped jewelry trinket box. The birthday rum cake with vanilla bean ice cream just blew my mind! The cake was so moist & full of flavor that left you wanting more. I mean, I loved it so much that Christian gave me 2 more to take home (which I ate for breakfast)! I will be eating at this fine restaurant more regularly now that I have discovered a piece of heaven in Phoenix.",

I've been to the best restaurants in Monte Carlo, Monaco (lived there), Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, some Michelin star restaurants, and this one is in their league.  I'm very fussy about eating fresh, quality, beautifully prepared and presented food.  Only one little thing, I found the service to be a little too fast for our liking, and one rest room.  We're used to going out in Europe to restaurants where it's normal to sit at a fine dining restaurant for 2 to 3 hours, to truly savor the food, atmosphere and company. The next time we will definitely mention it to our water. Also, the wooden chairs were hard and uncomfortable.   Otherwise I highly recommend this wonderful little treasure.",

    "text": "As everyone before has stated, this is a place you must experience!  I randomly stumbled upon the yelp reviews for this place last year when I was searching for a byob Valentine's dinner, and I thought the concept of the restaurant was interesting.  Turns out the place had been booked for months, but I thought it was really awesome that Chris took the time to call me and extend a warm welcome for another occassion.  Fast forward a year.  A friend of mine from Boston was coming into town, and asked me if there was any place I had always wanted to try; I threw out the idea of giving this place a try and he agreed that it sounded wonderful.  Thankfully we were able to get reservations this time:)  I really like the idea that the place was byob; it's very hard to find places anymore that allow it.  We had a heck of a time finding the place, but once we did, we were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was very charming and welcoming.  I was actually taken aback by how small the restaurant was inside; I believe there were 10 of us in the place total.  The tables were pretty close to one another but it somehow worked; it never felt like we were on top of another table.  It was really a pleasure watching Chris at work; I couldn't believe that someone could work alone and  be so organized and efficient.  My friend called ahead to warn of his food allergies and Chris was more than willing to cater to his needs.  THE FOOD!!!!! Oh wow; incredible.  Oddly enough, my friend and I both agreed that our favorite dish of the night was the starter salad.  I believe it was an arugala salad with fresh made hummus, apple and squash.  The hummus was extraordinary, and I had never even thought it belonged in a salad.  Boy was I wrong. For our entree with both chose the fillet and they were both cooked to absolute perfection.  Every item of the plate had such incredible flavor.  Desert was also very good, although the cheese that was used was a little pungent for my taste; so I stuck to the glazed and powder sugar coated strawberries and his homemade cinnammon sticks (I'm sorry, I have no idea what they are actually called).   Overall we were incredibly satisfied!  The cost was very comparable to any fancy steak house you would visit, but this place was by far superior.  Anytime we had a question for Chris he was more than willing to answer; and at the end of the evening when we were the last to leave, he came over to the table and chatted with us:)  I would recommend this place to ANYONE!!!",

The service was very friendly and attentive... in the beginning. Towards the end of my mom's and my meal, we felt sort of forgotten about.  I was expecting Chef Chris to call and confirm my reservation, based on other Yelpers reviews, which he did not. I was also hoping he would stop by my table, since I had specifically mentioned it was my first time coming and my mom was in town visiting from across the country. He did not stop by the table, but did talk to several other tables around us.  I had also mentioned we were celebrating my mom's birthday a week early, not in hopes of getting anything since the prix fixe menu Chef Chris offers already comes with dessert, but just so maybe someone would mention something to my mom and make her feel special. I wasn't very pleased when the three tables around us were all given their desserts with cute little birthday candles, but nothing for my mom.  As far as the food goes, I really did like both appetizers offered (we ordered one of each and shared), and the shrimp entree was very, very tasty. But neither my mom or I cared for the filet entree, as it was incredibly overcooked (the waitress said the beef would be prepared med-rare, it came out well as well can be) and the polenta served under the filet was very bland.  $45 per person, plus $10 corking fee led to a $108 dinner before tip, which for three courses and booze is pretty reasonable in Scottsdale, I just think I set my mental bar too high.  Cash only, btw.",

We called to see what they can do and even though they said their kitchen was closing very soon they went above and beyond to help us out. We ended up being an hour late so they could not serve all 4 courses,  but Christian (one of the owners) was super helpful, served us more than we expected and gave us special discount. The food was amazing (I got the fillet mignon and my husband the sea bass), the service was excellent, the wine great too, the environment so warm and romantic. I would absolutely recommend it and will certainly be going back. Thank you Christian!",

The inside is adorable, but smells of scented candles and, at least the evening we were there, was more than a little stuffy.   However, outside on the patio is one of the nicest spaces you will ever dine.  Bordered by thick foliage and large palm trees, lights strung overhead between you and the stars, just adorable, quant decorative touches, it's a pleasant and a perfect space for a special occasion, even it that special occasion is just dinner with a loved one.    Wife loved the Honey Pair cocktail, so much she had a second. My Prohibition was interesting, but the walnut was a bit too overwhelming.  Wine list short but brilliant; you don't see rose tavel on wine lists by the glass often and it's perfect for the setting.  The list felt well thought out by people who care.   Service impeccable, from front desk through the meal.    No reason to highlight the dishes, since they will be different when you go.  What's important to know is that they are well composed, consistently tasty, not huge portions.  You really don't need any \"add ons\" served with the main course.  Service will be a little slow, particularly with the main course. But you won't mind just relaxing in the beautiful setting, and it's a chance to have another class of rose tavel.",

I had scallops, which were incredible, but the real star of the show was the cauliflower soup. I've tried time and time again to recreate even a semblance of it in my own kitchen, but I'm convinced it cannot be done. This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion, get a little dressed up and go for a good old-fashioned Scottsdale people watching session.",

We thoroughly enjoyed each course of the New Year's Eve menu. Our waiter, a sommelier, was clearly passionate about the restaurant. Would go back in a heartbeat! Also- my husband and I are gluten free, which is often an inconvenience when eating out. Not only did our waiter assure us that he could accommodate any dietary restriction, he also explained how each course would be modified to make it gluten free! Hoorah!!",

I cannot stress how impressed I was and will definitely keep tabs on this chef and dine here whenever my job brings me back to the Phoenix area.   I made sure to call the manager over to deliver my compliments. I must also stress that I have never complimented a restaurant to the manager proactively.

I loved everything about this place. It's the perfect date night spot or place to celebrate an occasion.  The ambiance is dark and romantic but not overly done. The menu is a price fix menu so there are very few decisions to make. My husband and I started with the cauliflower soup that was topped with truffle oil. Of course it was tasty and rich. The next course was tempura battered prawn. The prawn was a good size and the flavors accompanying it really made the dish stand out. The third course was a Caesar salad which it was anything but. There were so many flavors that I never felt like I was eating a Caesar salad. This also happened to be my husband's favorite dish and he doesn't even like Cesar salads. The last course I had the Sea bass and he had the filet. We both enjoyed our meals and above all didn't leave feeling gross and overly stuffed. The portions were perfect. We topped the meal off with a flourless cake which was melt in your mouth delicious.   Our service was very good. We sat inside since we liked the interior of the place so much. Our waiter was very helpful with choosing a wine and explaining how the menu worked. He described the dishes that we could choose from in good detail to help us make our selections. They also give you time between dishes and never rush you. We enjoyed our bottle of wine and our dinner very much.",

It is romantic with low, but warm lighting. Everyone was so attentive, we weren't left sitting for long at any point. We were fortunate enough to be offered to try a pork course because my date and I both chose the same third course, and we gladly accepted. I understand why they wanted us to try this dish - it was amazing! And I don't even eat pork. Each course seemed to build on the last one. For my final course, I had the surf and turf and it was delicious, although it was more food than I needed; and after all the delicious items I felt the sea bass was underwhelming, but the lobster raviolo was incredible so I was a little disappointed they didn't put the 1/3 of my leftover raviolo in my togo container. My favorite dish was by far the deconstructed beef wellington, so fantastic, definitely get it if you can.    I would recommend and I can't wait to go back.",

They were just a stones throw from our table the entire night, which we greatly  appreciated and what I would expect from a restaurant like this.  Food was ok.  Nothing knocked our socks off.  We tried each of their starters, meaning there were two choices and we each had one of them.  They were ok.  For the main dish, I had the gnocchi seafood and my husband ordered the filet mignon and both were Ok. Some of the items on my dish were actually cold.  All of the food presented to us was served lukewarm:(    Their wine list was good and we enjoyed one bottle of wine, but their mark up seems higher than most places around town, so just expect to pay more.....

When we got to our table, the waiter gave us a rundown of the menu and the specials. He was knowledgeable and gave us a few recommendations of what he liked but it was pretty much everything on the menu.   It was a 4 course meal with the option of dessert (sort of). Everything was delicious. My only knock on it was that the waiter asked us what kind of dessert we liked and we said chocolate - he brought it out and charged us for it. I guess, it was a misunderstanding on our part. We were already full so we wouldn't have gotten it if we had to pay for it.   I would still recommend it for a special occasion as it was $280 or so for 2 people after tip.",

The menu changes often and features a divine four course meal made with fresh, local ingredients. There are two options for the first, second, and third courses so my boyfriend and I were able to try just about everything they offered that evening.   Our favorites were the yellowtail crudo, acorn squash with pomegranate couscous salad, and the lobster ravioli. For my main course I chose the pork chop. It was seriously like fall on a plate! It was served with a tomato polenta and pomegranate seeds and was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend couldn't decide between the rack of lamb and the sea bass. Our fabulous server, Wasam, recommended he choose the rack of lamb but was so kind to bring him a tasting portion of the sea bass AND the octopus. We ended our meal with the rum cake. OMG. Melt in your mouth delicious.   Above all, the service we received was so exemplary. My chair was pulled out each time I came back from the restroom, my napkin was placed on my lap, and I felt like a queen. The staff were all so pleasant and enjoyable to chat with. They truly provide an experience like none other. I can absolutely see why this is one of the top fine dining establishments in the Valley.",

    "text": "Just superb!!!!  The perfect destination for any special occasion with only a few negative comments that block the five star rating for the high-end price point.  Cafe Monarch is solidly giving Binkley's a run for the best restaurant in the Southwest.  From beginning to end, the chefs dazzle the patrons with flavors so well balanced and avoiding the grandstand showoff style of so many \"famous\" restaurants found on the coasts.  With the exception of some seafood misfiring, the menu is creative and balanced with execution you should expect.  The new location for Cafe Monarch has a very inviting outdoor seating area that compliments the more formal inside tables.  The staff is at once professional, attentive and prompt while still keeping the vibe welcoming and comfortably casual.  While the menu changes seasonally, tonight we enjoyed quite a culinary show.  Our first course was a choice of roast cauliflower soup with truffle scented oil or a filet with a soft hint of roasted jalapeno and micro cilantro greens.  Both were deeply flavorful and if you hold them on your tongue, open up further to reveal the layers of their flavor.  Second course was a choice of roasted acorn squash or jumbo lump crab cake.  The squash was roasted perfectly and the mixed arugula and whipped garganzola are so perfectly balanced and complimentary.  The crab cake was cooked well but I am going to start highlighting here that Cafe Monarch is exposing a weakness tonight with all things seafood.  Still, the crab cake is better than 90% of what Phoenix Metro has to offer but like the other seafood dishes here, just does not dazzle.   Third course, choice of pork loin roulade or sirloin tip.  The roulade was a rolled dumpling or sorts containing pork, prawns and Oaxaca cheese;surprisingly not heavy given it is deep fried. The sirloin tip with wine reduction is easily a main course if portioned a few ounces larger at any other establishment.  Fourth course, the main, mostly impresses further.  The pork chop is quite large but seasoned so well.  Perhaps the cut is too large in proportion to the accompaniments but flavorful nonetheless.  The rack of lamb is pure culinary delight.  Lean and seasoned softly but the Pinot reduction and black plum are so complimentary and dazzling.  Our group also ordered two seafood dishes.  As I mentioned before, this is Cafe Monarchs soft spot.  The Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare was conceptually appealing but the quality of the actual seafood components was below expectation and actually betrayed the likelihood that certain components were previously frozen as the fishy oils were too forward.  The other seafood-containing dish, Surf and Turf Trio.  The filet was executed well and standard.  The sea bass was expectedly buttery and light but quite honestly a standard any high end restaurant should offer and execute well.  The seafood gnocchi again gave off the aforementioned fishy oils, particularly from the shrimp.  But the real issue with this whole course as a whole was that all of the seafood items were not only suggestive of being less than fresh but tepid when they arrived to the table.  At $350/couple, I feel it is reasonable to expect perfection from service, flavor and execution.    Every restaurant has random nights when things misfire.  I very much hope that Cafe Monarch's few seafood missteps tonight were an anomaly and I very much look forward to an opportunity to return and amend this review upward.",

    "text": "In summary, one of the best meals and experiences in our lives.  We have had the privilege of traveling and visiting some of the nation's top restaurants, and I have worked in the wine industry (both at winery and restaurant ends) for years, so this praise is not handed out lightly.  Stepping out of the car in front of the unique building that houses Cafe Monarch, we knew this would be different. The prior reviews ramped up our expectations.  We were greeted at the large gate by the hostess lighting two large heart shaped candelabra and ushered into the large courtyard with a beautiful fountain - feeling special already. Stepped inside to the most amazing and unique architecture - seemingly in old world Tuscany - and taking in all of the details.   We were seated at the window viewing the fountain, at a table adorned with tulips and a candle, under a gorgeous chandelier hanging from the hand painted, domed ceiling...now if the service and food can live up to the atmosphere...  The menu is four courses - a choice between two or three dishes for course one, two and three (these are small, but large enough to share) and then a fourth \"main\" course which determines the price of your meal. You can choose to have a course-by-course wine pairing for an additional fee (I would recommend putting yourself in the somm's hands here). Dessert provides closure.  Our server/sommelier Sam came over asked about us, what we liked, and told us a little about the evolution of the Cafe. We elected to have Sam pair wines with our courses and act as our guide. His cheer, and knowledge of food and beverage - coupled with the staff's flawless service, made this a magical night. All we could do is say \"wow\" and wish this was not 3/4 of the way across the country.   We enjoyed the best clam chowder ever for course #1, paired with a Savart Blanc de Noirs Champagne. Sam selected an Italian white, Graci Etna Bianco, to pair with a fresh Dungeoness crab \"salad\", essentially crab in a leaf of bib lettuce with toasted Pepitas, Avocado and Dill Crema. The crab was so fresh, it tasted like it just came out of Bodega Bay.  Our third, a tuna tartare served over crisped rice \"cracker\" (not a real cracker), drizzled with a chili aioli was out of this world, dazzled when paired with a Trimbach Alsacian Riesling.  My wife and I diverged for our main course - she went with the duck and I went with the beef, paired with a Tor Grenache from CA (winemaker Jeff Ames is a friend) and an Italian Ornellia Le Serre Nuovo Rosso, respectively. Both hit the mark, and the duck/grenache pairing was nirvana (talking goosebumps).  Dessert with an Alvarez Sherry sealed the deal.  If you visiting the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is a must for a dinner. If you live in the area - lucky you.  PS - Sam - good luck on your Master's exam!",

    "text": "Ranked number 1 as the most romantic restaurant of the country (based on data gathered through yelp apparently) - my husband and I came to Cafe Monarch to celebrate a belated V-day.   I've been spoiled by endless Michelin star restaurants and countless ridiculously priced fine dining - although Cafe Monarch didn't top my fav list, it def broke into my top 5. From ambiance to service to food, every category was beaming 5 stars across the board.  Soup, salad, steak, fish - whatever you order, be prepared to be wowed! Every course was thought out and explained to fine details. Every dish was meticulously put together and beautifully presented. I honestly loved every component of my dishes (a smear of a sauce, a shred of greens), every bite was heavenly. The time lapsed between each course was just right. Our 4 courses plus their complimentary dessert only took about 90 mins from start to finish.   Menu changes every two weeks so no point of my going into details. The only change I wish to see is for them to offer bread service. I was surprised that a fine dining restaurant like this didn't offer it. But then again the 4 course meal is probably more than enough to satisfy most stomach (just not mine).   Overall - who can give less than 5?",

    "text": "So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, \"top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'\". Or something like that.  This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).  My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.  Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, \"I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers\". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.  So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.  You're welcome.",

    "text": "Definitely worth 5 stars. Everything about my visit to Cafe Monarch was exceptional.   First, we were immediately intrigued by the brightly colored wall paint that had the two brunch choices for the day. Sweet & Savory. Both options sounded great, but I went for the Savory - which was a grilled salmon with tomato sauce & a baked spinach & potato quiche. The salmon was perfect - the best I have ever had. Many times salmon can get pretty dry, but it was tender and juicy. The quiche complimented the salmon nicely. It had a hint of spice (something - I could not distinguish) I thought both the presentation and taste was quite amazing.  My girlfriend got the sweet option. Naturally, I am not into the fruit tarts, but I think chef Chris had a nice balance between fruits and vegetables. The plate came with a giant hunk of brie. I would say that even though it wasn't for me, it was still delightful.  I am a sucker for D.I.Y decor. This place is filled with nick nacks that just make you smile. You can feel the passion that Chris has for culinary and interior design. You must go to the bathroom while at Cafe Monarch! Its super cool.   After brunch we talked to Chris about his work, and he was very informative and humble. Upon leaving, we felt nothing but good feelings about supporting Chris and Cafe Monarch. It was a truly unique experience that set the precedent for me. Well done Chris!",

I let them know that we were dining here for a recent engagement and WOW they did not disappoint.  We dined outside, and despite it being over 100 degrees it was not a shock to see most patrons dining outside.  The misters kept everything cool, and the garden atmosphere is both unique and romantic.  The fountain and the greenery add a special touch to a small street in Scottsdale.  The food was also fantastic and each course was fantastic.  They respected our food limitations but the meal was not lacking in any way.  We will definitely be back!  We loved Cafe Monarch, and hope others have the same experience!",

    "text": "Wow.  That about sums it up.  After cancelling a brunch reservation for my fiance's birthday, we scurried on over to Cafe Monarch.  Fabulous Sunday, and the weather is gorgeous.  We drive up to Cafe Monarch a little early to avoid the Sunday crowd (thanks to the advice of some reviewers since Cafe Monarch is a one-man show and can get pretty busy).  There are beautiful monarch butterflies flying around the outside of the Cafe.  Beautiful landscaping and cafe style, white linen tables adorn Monarch.    Chef Chris is outside writing up the day's sweet & savory brunch menu.  We walk on over, and he remembers the message I had left him the day before.  He wishes Edgar a happy birthday.  He explains the way the restaurant is run and tells us to help ourselves to the beverage area as there's hibiscus tea, coffee, water w/mint leaves and orange juice.  A cute little station with beautiful drinkware.  We help ourselves and get comfy on a bench outside.    A few minutes in, his helper comes out and tells us to take a seat anywhere we'd like and asks us what we would like to order.  We order one each of both dishes.  One savory and one sweet.  When our meals actually came out, we took one bit, and I went inside to tell Chef Chris to bring us each the opposite of what we just ordered.  We couldn't share!  It was too dang good!  DELICIOUS is an understatement!  For the sweet dish we had pumpkin french toast with roasted pear, amber maple syrup, cranberry butter and spicy chicken sausage.  For savory we had grilled porkloin w/feta, herb potatoes, fried egg and tomato sauce.    The flavors that were extracted from these dishes are unbelievable.  Chef Chris creates a custom menu every single day, and you'll never have the same meal here.  It was divine.  The french toast is one, if not THE BEST french toast my fiance and I have ever had anywhere.  We didn't drench the french toast with syrup as there was no need for it.  The texture was spot on, and it was moist.  The cranberry butter was absolutely delicious, and it accompanied nicely to the chicken sausage.    The porkloin was cooked PERFECTLY.  Not dry and not under done.  The herb potatoes were stacked beautifully with wonderful herbs and spices, and the very top layer was crispy.  Perfectly cooked fried eggs (it takes a real special person to make perfect eggs in my opinion), and the tomato sauce was out of this world.  This wasn't some run of the mill tomato sauce.  It was home made, thick and hearty tomato sauce.    This was the perfect way to end our trip to Scottsdale, and we were so happy to have been able to experience Cafe Monarch.  Chef Chris is truly talented, and you can feel his passion and love for what he does.  Not a lot of Chefs carry this same passion, but he does.  There is LOVE in each and every dish - no factory style kitchen dishes coming out of here.    My fiance said it... \"the best breakfast I've ever had.\"  Thank you again Chef Chris!",

Always let Yelp reviews guide me and my fellow yelpers did NOT let me down.  This was the  most elegant, romantic, culinary experience we could have found.  The weather was unbelievable so it made the evening even more amazing.  We sat out on their patio and had the most memorable experience we've had in a long while.  The customer service exceeds that of any fine restaurant I've ever been to in LA, Paris, New York, and other cities known for their foodie-like experiences.  We were fortunate to have Sam that evening and his mentee, Michael.  They were a large part of what made this evening so memorable.  They went above and beyond to make sure that our needs were met and that everything was perfect.  I, unfortunately, cannot eat spicy foods or my stomach rebels instantly but they worked with the chef to make sure that every dish was tailor made and was as flavorful (or more) than the spicy dish that was part of the menu.  The food, all of it, was outstanding and each creation was a flavorful explosion.  The brussel sprout appetizer, the watermelon salad, the soft-shell crab (a real treat), the sea bass (melted in my mouth), and the wine selection were outstanding.  They also treated us to their rum cake for dessert.  I kept looking around to see if I could lick each and every plate.  And i'm not really a plate-licker.  They even gave us a little anniversary gift.  This place is magical.  I hope that they continue to make magic.  Thank you Cafe Monarch!",

We felt like we were eating at a friends house instead of at a restaurant.  Chris, the owner and chef, is a great cook, improvises magically and is very personable.  Instead of ordering from a menu, we were told by Chris what he had available in the kitchen...and he then offered options on how he could prepare to our tastes.  How great is that.  I started with a strong cup of coffee...Chris serves Cafe Du Monde...which is primo coffee which speaks to the coffee enthusiast.  My wife and I split a great French onions soup....which was great if you like onions!  I followed with a chicken sandwich with roasted peppers, goat cheese, spinach and cilantro. My wife had a chicken sandwich as well with bacon, fig, spinach and mint.  Both sandwiches were amazing and innovative.  We took notes on how to make to repeat when we got home!  However, the best part of Cafe Monarch is Chris...a great chef and business owner.  He cares about his guests, what they eat and sincerely wants you to have a great experience....and we did.   We'd go back again...and if I'm back in Scottsdale for business...I will!",

Light and crispy on the outside. And not just \"fluffy\" on the inside. More unique - almost like a popover texture in the middle. Not overly sweet, just the crispy, moist waffles with natural sweetness from the berries and a handmade syrup from fruit.  Then a whole nother course: scrambled eggs on top of melting gouda, next to toast with pesto and artichoke hearts, bacon and chicken breast stuffed with sausage.  Either one of these courses could have been my whole brunch. But I couldn't resist eating both. Thank god we rode bikes there and back, and then rode again later to dinner with friends in the hood.  And great news! Smokehouse Sunday is theoretically starting next Sunday at 11am. (for future reference: this review is from Oct 2008)",

The chef, Chris, cooks with love and artistry from the moment he greets you to the moment he serves you. My salmon dish was prepared perfectly (I told him I wanted something healthy) with a blend of mixed vegetables. It just wasn't the meal itself that was good, but the presentation and portion of my meal. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me, but it was beautiful. He then surprised me with a small slice of bread pudding for dessert soaked in (vanilla?) cream sauce. Is he a mind reader, too? Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts.  The one thing that makes this place so unique is that there's only one chef and maybe another server to help him out. Remember, patience is a virtue. Don't expect a large menu, though, because there isn't one. Simply displayed on a chalkboard are a few items you can choose from for lunch. I will definitely be back to enjoy his brunch.  Oh! And for those of you not in the know. I love (addicted) to coffee and I kid you not...my coffee mug was never empty. Chris kept that baby and my caffeine levels loaded. Maybe I should marry this guy?",

I've been to Cafe Monarch in Scottsdale now 3 times since it's relaunch under the guise of Christian Lewkowicz and chef Andy Nienke, each time more pleased than the last. The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixe offerings. With only limited seating, you must call in advance. There is nothing more magical than dinner in the candlelit courtyard garden, which is where 'my' table is located. Last night I was treated to an amazing experience that I've come to know, if not expect from this talented duo. The amuse bouche was a tartare on a slightly toasted incredibly fresh baguette with a simple piece of raw red onion. \"Heaven\" The salad was a deconstructed caprese with heirloom tomatoes marinated in truffle oil over some of the freshest mozzarella I've ever tasted.  Entree choices were slow braised short ribs or grilled shrimp over polenta. My dining companion chose the short ribs, and absolutely loved them.  After a taste, I totally agreed with him. They were melt in your mouth tender, and so juicy and succulent. I chose the shrimp. I know you're thinking grilled shrimp? Yes, grilled shrimp. 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp over the most tasty polenta all topped with a delightful sweet/sour reduction that tied the textures and favors together like...well, like, The Millionaire Matchmaker was involved!  Each course is perfectly sized so that you can enjoy the flavors and not be overwhelmed with the taste. I know you know what I mean. You sit there beautiful meal presented to you, a huge portion of it, and you feel obligated to eat it. Don't deny the truth we've all been there!!!  The final course of the evening was a light and creamy ice cream, house made of course, bits of chewy, gooey chocolate cake and very slightly sweetened whipped cream, all with fresh sliced strawberries.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but the portion was just right for me.  Just a couple of bites is all I typically have, and that is what it was...just the perfect final bites to a fantastic meal.  Do not forget they also prepare lunch on Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays with the same choice pre-fixe menu.   Please do yourself a huge favor and get to Cafe Monarch as soon as you can. I can not wait to go back!!!",

It was the real deal and it was of the best restaurant meal experiences I've been able to share with my family.    I was a bit worried about the small first, second and third courses but those were my favorite part of the meal.   It was so nice to try something wonderful and have time to rest in between.   The presentation was really very nice and added to the experience.   I was also afraid that the entree was going to be smaller but I under estimated the meal.

My boyfriend and I had a four-course meal here of course and it was just wonderful. I love how the menu said \" vegetarian option available \" score!!!!!! $$$$$  Our first course was the roasted cauliflower. Oh wowwww. So creamy and so tasteful.  Second course was the spring salad. Best salad I had ever had actually.  Third course was the gnocchi for me and the lollipop lamb chop for the bf. He said it was heavenly. The gnocchi was a bit chewy, but the sauce was delicious.  Fourth course was the polenta lasagna and the rosary filet mignon. I absolutely loved my lasagna. I would have finsihed it but I was so full from all the food I had prior to my entree. The mushrooms was delightful. Ummm I can tell he loved his filet mignon......... cause his face expression said it all. Hahaha.  I'LL BE BACK.  Yesss. Take me backkkkkkk",

    "text": "One of the most unique dining experiences in Phoenix and around. I, for a moment forgot that I was actually in Phoenix.   It's a perfect place to celebrate an occasion . I was giving a surprise to my friend and they do this birthday thing with an amazing dessert and a sparkler.  The moment I entered the place, I was in awe of it, it was romantic yet so easy and casual.  The service was just extra ordinary, never did I see the glass half empty with water. They took care of so many things in such a subtle way. We were having a great time and we never thought we needed anything else. It looked so much like Europe to me TBH.  The thoughtfulness around food is amazing. The roasted cauliflower was the best thing I tasted ever. Each course was so  well thought off and unique in its own way. The flavours and combinations were so dynamic. Definitely recommend this place. A little pricey but well worth it with the experience you get out of it.  I'm ready to go back here in a second.  P.S Do request for a courtyard seating . It Is mind blowing.",

We made a reservation a week ahead.  Had to wait at the bar over 30 mins on my bday for my table which was booked a week ahead.  Service was terrible not impressed with the food.  They brought out a few wrong orders.  Both of our seabass was over cooked taste more like chicken it was so over cooked.  I said something they didn't even take it off the bill.  Service was so rushed stressed out.  Running fast like a chicken with their head cut off.  Beautiful inside.  Bad food bad service.  Ruin my bday dinner.",

    "text": "Dinner for two after a spring training game.  We booked our reservation months in advance. (They warn you that outdoor patio seating is on best-efforts basis when you book). We arrived, plenty of parking, and were greeted by Matre' D.  She told us we would be seated in 20 minutes.   Things went downhill from there until we were finally seated to a delicious dinner.   We were asked to 'wait' at a table, they would serve cocktails and and app.  We were ignored for 15 minutes (I went back to complain) and then we were finally served a drink and the yummy appetizer showed up.  The cocky waiter asked how our drinks were (I didn't like my cocktail).  He never asked me - he just smiled at my wife who enjoyed hers and just left. After another twenty minutes he never returned.  I went back up to ask to be served another cocktail - since our waiter was too busy or indifferent to serve us.  I wanted to leave at that point.    Almost all of the 'waiting to be seated' tables were assigned tables while we were waiting for our drink (45 minutes later).    My wife left for for the bathroom and came back telling me about the 'line' for the ladies room.  She was stunned that a restaurant could get a way with so few bathrooms (she is a space planner).  Finally we were shown our table (so they get 1 STAR for the first 45 minutes).  After that things got better.  We sat on the patio (a delightful venue), and enjoyed a very nice dinner (check out their menu).  Our waiter was quite knowledgeable  and helpful.   The food was 4 star quality. And dinner service was great.  Monarch needs to focus on expectation setting and weak staff.   This is a place with a great venue (worth waiting for) with terrific food but:   - maitre' D cant set expectations   - one waiter in front area needs to be let go   - bathroom situation needs investigation",

    "text": "Double Woohoo!  When Adonis wants to take Aphrodite out for Valentine's Day and they happen to be vacationing in Scottsdale (?) this is absolutely where he'd take her.  First off, their adobe courtyard is a stunner. Take a look at the pix~! Olympianly romantic. So if you want to impress your honey with rustic elegance you've found the golden apple of restaurants.  The dinner format is great, too. Three set courses followed by your choice of entre. We loved everything served: soup (the truffled cauliflower with beet chip and pinon garnish was about the best soup I've ever tasted . . . anywhere . . . anytime), salad and appetizer/small plate (a wonderful tempura tiger prawn with an amazing tomato chili jam) were all the same for each diner. You then had your choice of entre with a slightly variable price. Every dish was simply superb. Superb, as in memorably and unusually delicious.  Dessert rocked (my favorite = the rum cake, my sweetheart's was the flourless chocolate cake), as did the service. All in all, one of the top 10 meals I can remember having anywhere around the world. And that's a lot to say.  Sign me, David \"Your faithful subject\" M.  P.S. Helpful hint--Because you don't get to choose your first 3 courses, be sure to check out their menu on-line before going to make sure everything you're going to get is something you'll like and/or be able to eat. If that's not True, then have the smarts to call beforehand and make arrangements for an alternative dish so both you and the restaurant won't be placed in an uncomfortable position as the dinner progresses.",

    "text": "What a truly amazing dining experience. One of the most romantic restaurants I have ever been too. I came here with a colleague and we were surrounded by couples celebrating birthdays and anniversaries with the signature sparkler dessert.   Upon arrival we were told our table wasn't ready yet - instead of standing around waiting in a bar we were directed to a table on the front patio and were served complimentary appetizers and delicious cocktails. What is this magical fairytale land? Twinkle lights, fresh flowers, candles, all the attention to detail. I had the Conquistador cocktail with vodka, lime, strawberries, fresh basil and ginger beer - so good. The appetizer was a bruschetta with brie and caramelized brussel sprout leaves - I would have been satisfied with just that.   But then we were escorted to the outdoor dining patio - covered in twinkle lights with roses at each table. The four course menu started with a lobster bisque, followed by a salad, and a foie gras wellington. For the main course I had the crispy chicken that was perfectly moist and juicy on the inside. Dessert was not included but we couldn't leave at this point without it. I had a decadent warm chocolate cake and a frothy foamy cappuccino.   The service was impeccable - always there refilling water, folding your napkin if you got up from the table. The bathroom was just a continuation on the adorable cottage decor. I felt like I was in a Beatrix Potter story.   And the prices weren't bad - not compared to what we've become accustomed to in LA.",

The food was fabulous!  Each course was perfect.    I could only give 4 stars and debated about giving only 3 stars.   We were a large party dining for dinner at the later seating. We had a delicious meal with a hefty bill...I only wish the service had been as good.    For a restaurant of this caliber,  we expected much better service.    Little things like having to \"ask\" for more water to our table being cleared as we were finishing desert.  (As I said we were the later seating and the restaurant was still quite full.   In other words, we did not overstay.  In fact, it felt like we were pushed out). Considering the cost of dining here, this was simply unacceptable.     If they did not want a large party, they should not have taken our reservation.    Needless to say, we won't be returning as there are plenty of great options in the area that are the whole package..food, atmosphere and service.",

Everything my date and I ordered was delicious. We started with the foie gras, I enjoyed the cauliflower soup, beef tartare, duck breast, seafood risotto and the rum cake all of which were FANTASTIC!!! The service was fabulous, our server was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and extremely attentive without being annoying. We sat outside on the perfectly heated patio. I would definitely recommend for any and all occasions! I can't wait to go back next weekend!",

Make sure you come here hungry. Even thing the portions are appropriately sized it's still a lot of delicious food.   The atmosphere is very intimate especially if you sit outside. Vines, candles, and string lights make this a truly romantic experience.   They moved across the street from the original location due to structural issues, but the new building is just as cozy.   They have retained the old location and use it for functions and complimentary valet parking for the restaurant.",

Every dish left my hubby and me speechless. Their cocktails were phenomenal too and complemented the dishes. We tried \"The Monarch\", \"The Spaniard\", and \"El Diablo\". All very tasty but my favorite was \"The Monarch\" just because I love the fresh fruit juice concoction.   I love that it's a set menu of 4 courses:  1. Roasted Cauliflower Soup - literally woke us up and prepared us for what's to come next  2. Spring Salad - This is what I envision what Spring would taste like. I'm just drooling thinking about it again  3. Lollipop Lamb Chop - Exactly like the name. I wanted to pick up the lamb chop and save it for dessert because it was so good  4. There are 4 selections to choose from but I got the \"Rosemary Seared Filet Mignon\" - The filet literally cut like butter and just melted in my mouth  There was a complementary dessert for me since it was my birthday - their Rum Cake, which was out of this world and they even gave me a gift! It's a cute delicate jewelry box. I loved it!   I love restaurants that take the time to be detailed in their decor, service, and everything else. Their attention to detail and consideration definitely showed from entering the restaurant until the last step I took as we walked out - completely blown away!   We'll definitely be going back in the near future, special occasion or not :)",

Very beautiful. you can't order a la cart when you sit down , you order from 4 course menu ranging from $104-150,  there are only 2 options per course to choose from.  When we got the 3rd course of salmon I was not impressed with the dish, it was served almost raw (which is ok with me) but the texture of course is soft, served with potato salad (weird combo) that was also very soft and mushy. A very very hot pepper that was so spicy I couldn't finish the dish, Served with some random parsnip chips. That dish didn't come together for me. I wasn't impressed there. Also there was arugula salad on half the dishes, which I like arugula salad but it was overused. For the trio tomato second course I enjoyed the tomato soup ball. That was really good! But the slice of tomato with arugula salad was meh and the petit for of tomato and bacon was also just OK. I could taste lot of vinegar with the bacon.  My husbands lamb dish was impressive though. Cooked perfectly -sous vide and seared. But the polenta grits that it came with was lumpy and just not a good texture. I ordered the \"basket of seafood\" dish which was tasty. The sauce was very nice. It fell short because my Tiger Prawn was so over cooked it was hard to chew. I told the waiter and they took some $$ off the bill.  Our desert of cheesecake and chopped plums was OK, it needed a sauce to bring it together a little better. The cheesecake was a little tough and dry. The whipped cream helped but I wanted just a little more Overall it was Good! Just not Amazing. We have been to New York and have eaten at 2 Michelin star restaurants for the same price as this place and I was blown away over there. Thank you but overall not impressed. And for the price I wanted to be!",

    "text": "Wow! I wish I could give this place more than five stars. They went above and beyond to make it a special night for our anniversary! They recently changed locations to a new building that is down the street. I never saw the first building, but this location was incredibly nice! They have a free valet for when you arrive and immediately upon walking in you are greeted by the hostess.   We had a reservation at 7 but we weren't seated until 7:30 due to a staffing issue. So we waited at the bar and learned all about the different wines from the sweet bartender. She was very knowledgeable and even let us sample a couple wines before we picked.   Once the table was ready, we were served water and ordered drinks. I have celiac's so I had questions about gluten-free options. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and went through the menu with me. He said almost all the dishes could be made gluten-free and they were so willing to accommodate for me! They even have vegetarian options!   The menu changes every three weeks when new and fresh ingredients arrive. They serve four courses and then dessert at the end. We ordered crab blossoms for our first course and our waiter brought the special gluten-free soup they make because it was one of their specialties. I'm so happy I tried it because it was absolutely delicious!   They take their time between each course that way you aren't completely stuffed. When it comes to the fourth course, they let you wait a little longer that way you have room to finish it. The plates may look small, but they are incredibly filling! We were stuffed by the end of the night, but they insisted on treating us with dessert for our anniversary.   We got the flourless chocolate cake with a little sprinkler on top and two glasses of champagne to celebrate! What made the experience so great was the staff (and food of course)! They were all so kind, knowledgeable, and made the night special for us. I love that they change the menu so often because that means there is always something new to try!",

All the staff including valets are acutely aware of the \"pics or it didnt happen\" culture of our generation and are quick to offer to take photos of you, for you. This included photos in front of the fountain at the entrance, with dinner and any other time we had our phone out.   We did the 4 course meal and it did not disappoint. I don't think there is a wrong option in the menu. We opted to sit inside and its beautiful. They have mist blowing outside to keep you cool. But the indoor decor is amazing. I'd sit inside again, if I had the chance.   Their only bottle neck is the restrooms, single stall one for men and one for women. At a certain point in the evening a line of 4+ women formed so the staff encouraged us to use both restrooms.",

    "text": "This dining experience is similar to a fine dining pre-set coursed meal you may experience at other fine dining establishments. Our dinner menu was four courses, and the price of the meal is set by your choice of the fourth course that ranges from $80-160.   ATMOSPHERE: Exceptional. Romantic. Elegant. Sophisticated. All of the details of this restaurant work very well together to create a wonderfully intimate and personalized meal.   FOOD: Here is where my review may (hopefully not) get a bit confusing. Our first three courses were exquisite!   Every taste was mouth watering and delightful  That being said our group of four ordered fourth course entrees that included the recommended lamb, Chilean sea bass, and also the bigger ticket prime rib ($160). As delicious and enjoyable as our first 3 courses were, the entrees fell very very short. The prime rib was overly salted it was almost inedible. The Chilean sea bass was overcooked, granulated and heavily salted also. The surf n turf was equally over salted. The only entree which met our expectation from the previous courses was the lamb rack.   A few things to take into consideration are that our dinner reservation was at 8p so like with any other fine dining coursed meal the dinner is not served until 2-3 hours into the meal so our fourth entree was served at 10:30pm. Not sure if this is why our fourth course star of the meal was so disastrous but it definitely was not up to the par of fine dining.   I would rate our first 3 courses and experience as 5 star and the entree course as 1 star hence the 3 star overall rating.  This restaurant brings fine dining and atmosphere together for a great experience but I wouldn't return or recommend it either.",

My AZ bestie selected this restaurant for our sexy lady dinner and it did not disappoint.  Not only was the food incredible, the entire experience was fantastic.  We arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation so we obviously needed to try a fancy cocktail at their bar.  I had the Aztec Fire (described as a marg with a kick) and my friend had the Peruvian Rose, an incredibly balanced and elegant little drink.    We were seated at our table in the main dining area, which is quite possibly the most elegant/sophisticated/visually stunning place I have ever been in. Our server was very professional and knowledgable.  He expertly guided us through the wine list when we inquired about sharing a bottle.  We both chose the 4 course which is awesome because it's like the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books I read as a kid.  You get to choose from two options from the first 3 courses, and then the fourth course gets intense because there are about half a dozen selections to choose from.  If the octopus is still on the menu when you dine here (because obviously you will be eating here if you've made is this far in my rambling review!) GET THE OCTOPUS.  Omg. It was divine.  Dessert was stellar.  Get the rum cake.  Make a reservation! You will love it.  I promise.  Also note:  wear something three steps above \"nice\" because this place is classy AF.  And expect this wonderful meal to last a good 3+ hours.",

    "text": "We were in Phoenix for end of year holidays and were pretty much trying different restaurants based on reviews throughout our trip. Cafe Monarch was by far the most exquisite, romantic and memorable dining experience we had while we were there. The service at the restaurant was very attentive and the mentality was more like...let them know what you wanted and they would try their best to do that for you. If you are a wine lover, this is a place to go to as well. They have a huge collection of wine and the very initimate makes it so romantic and 100% date or special occasion appropriate. You will impress your date (hopefully beyond 1st date) with this choice!  They had fixe prix menu and you have a few options from their course. You may also choose to do wine pairing, too. Lucky for us as we had taken a look on they website before dining there, so we knew they also had a vegetarian menu option (and as such both opt for that and selected pretty much most of the dishes for our 2 courses so we got to try almost everything on that menu). We were really glad we went with the vegetarian menu as the course was pretty sizeable (and since we pretty much were gluttony who has been stuffing ourselves with food throughout our trip), it made sense we opted for a bit lighter meal by both going for a vegetarian course.  Overall, this was a very nice, memorable evening for us. Our waiters were personable and really took service to heart. Very top notched food/service. Definitely very date/celebratory occasion appropriate...and surprisingly..the meals weren't too outrageously expensive! Our course were ~$100pp but the quality and service far exceeded what we paid for sure!  P.S. this is a place where you are highly recommended to RSVP for your table. Dress nicer for this place, too. We went pretty much very casual when dining there as that's what we were more used to in Seattle. But everyone there dressed nicely so..you'd probably feel more comfortable fitting into the ambiance if you did that. Our waiters didn't give us hard time or judgement though...so kudos to them! Thank you for such awesome hospitality again. If I ever am in the area again, I would love to dine here again. A plus that the menu changes every few weeks to adjust to available seasobal ingredients, too.",

My husband and I went here for my birthday and they really did know how to make someone feel special. First off, the ambiance was very classy and romantic. The service was exceptional and they were very accommodating with their menus. There are two 4-course prixe menus (regular and vegetarian). My husband ordered from the regular and I ordered from the vegetarian. I'm not vegetarian but I don't eat red meat or certain seafood so I thought it'd be best to order from the vegetarian. I'm so happy I did! Everything was delicious! I had no idea that vegetarians could enjoy such flavorful and filling meals. My husband absolutely loved his meal as well. When it came time for dessert, they surprised me with a nice light airy dessert topped with firework candle and a gift! The gift was this cute silver and pearl box that is perfect to store jewelry in. Everyone should experience the food and service. They even had free valet parking!",

It's definitely a little pricey, so probably more of a special occasion restaurant than standard date night, but hey, if you wanna ball out, ball out.   Everything here is Prixe Fixe and the portions are pretty solid, so come hungry. While the food is very pretty, the portions are substantial. Everything here was very good, but I didn't particularly care for the compressed watermelon salad. I'm not a huge fan of salads to begin with and this was a bit too foo-foo for me.   The menu changes constantly, but if they have the Iberico pork chop on the menu, order it without hesitation. I'm normally a filet kind of guy, but I am so glad I ordered the pork chop. It was the best pork chop I have ever had. It had a slight spice to it and was super thick. Everything was prepared perfectly.   Service here is absolutely top notch. Food comes out quickly, but the courses are timed very nicely and never feels rushed. Parking lot is pretty small, but there is normally parking on the street if you go down a little. Definitely recommend this place for any special occasion. It's one of the best.",

    "text": "Cafe Monarch  Heard nothing but excellent things about Cafe Monarch and it definitely lived up to the high standards that it was hyped up to be. This was definitely a top 5 restaurant in Phoenix Scottsdale area that I have been to.  Billed as a top 100 Best Restaurant in America, 100 Most Romantic Restaurants in America, TripAdvisor & Open Table Top restaurants in America, Phoenix Magazine Best Special Occasion Restaurant, Phoenix New Times Best Restaurant and many others, many years running. There is a reason for all the accolades and certainly every aspect of the dining experience was well represented.  The restaurant does a four course prix fixe menu with the fourth course determing the price. There are gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options upon request.  For the First Course there were 2 selections and we tried both, Roasted Cauliflower Soup that consisted of White Truffle Oil, Pine Nuts, Herb Butter Crostini topped with a signature M which was very rich and tasty. The other selection was a a Seared Salmon Crudo with Scotch Ginger Mignonette, Avocado Salad, Cucumber, Breakfast Radish, Tomato Jam, Micro Cilantro, Plantain Chip, Yuzu Butter which also was delicious. Personally, I prefer the Roasted Cauliflower Soup which is one of their signature dishes.  Going on to the Second Course there was also 2 selections, we all chose the Tempura King Tiger Prawn which was huge and prepared  in a Spiced Papaya Salad, Peppadew Pepper Aioli, Yellow Tomato Jam, Citrus Vinaigrette. The Tiger Prawn was a good size and so tasty, glad I ordered this selection.  The Third Course had 3 selections which we choose the Seared Maine Diver Scallops which was monstorous, I have not had such a large scallop since in Hong Kong and they were on the shell. It was prepared with a Yukon Potato Wasabi Puree, Pear Tare Sauce, Avocado Mousse, Sesame Seed Seaweed Salad with Crispy Shallot Rings. So good, almost hate to share . The other selection that we chose was the Orecchiette Bolognese, my son could not pronounce it properly and Sam our waiter quickly and kiddingly said \"what did you call me, don't call me that again\" which really broke the ice and Sam was just spectacular.  On to the Fourth Course, we all had different items, Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon ($95), Lamb Rack ($115), Risotto ai Frutti di Mare ($95). Each were excellent and stood out in it's own way.  The Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon was in a smoked sweet potato puree, charred broccoli, cipollini onion, golden chanterelle mushrooms, cabernet sauvigon beef jus along with crispy elephant garlic chips. Have to say the USDA Prime Beef was about the best and most tender beef I have ever had.  The Rack of Lamb is an organic new zealand lamb, black pepper polenta, arugula salad, bruleed figs and crows dairy feta. Good amount of lamb and a very tender flavorful taste.  The last entree that we had was recommended by Sam our waiter, the Risotto ai Frutti di Mare which consisted of seared diver scallops, king crab, tiger prawn, poached maine lobster, cured cherry tomatoes, pecan arugula pesto, crispy potatoes, shaved pecorino and lobster fumet. What an amazing dish and if you are a seafood lover this is it.  After 2.5 hours of eating, our meal was topped off with a complimentary birthday dessert of Chocolate Flourless Cake which had seasonal berries, cherries, raspberry coulis, black cherry gelato and caramel pearls  Sam our waiter was exceptional with unbelievable knowledge of the food, preparation and pairing. He had great suggestions and made our experience a very fun and memorable time to celebrate my wife's birthday. What a special way to enjoy our celebration. To top it off, when they brought out the complimentary dessert it was accompanied with a gift and sparkler where it ended up being a small jewelry box. Very nice touch.  Parking is horrible, street parking or valet on a Wednesday. Valet your car  Highly recommend a wonderful celebration at this incredible restaurant.",

    "text": "This is the best restaurant I've been to in the greater Phoenix metro area. It is also one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in the last half decade, and I've eaten at several Michelin starred places this year alone. The service was superb and not in a sterile, insincere way. It seemed genuine and as if the person was hosting you as a guest in their elegant home. I found it to be the best possible balance of upscale and elegant yet not pretentious or overly self-important.   It was my first time at Monarch, which I've wanted to try for a few years. It will not be my last. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, presentation, service, and ambiance. I could not have asked for more or better. This is now my favorite restaurant in the valley by a long shot.   The cocktails were delicious though I switched to wine after one, but my friend enjoyed both of hers. I was glad they had a Sancerre that I could order by the glass, especially since I chose so many fish selections. The tartare was my friend's favorite, which was on my plate bit we had to taste everything. The pork belly a-mouse bouche was phenomenal and is the reason I plan to go to the next restaurant as soon as it is open.   The beef tip was my favorite due to the bit of magical green sauce atop. It reminded me of a chimichurri sauce (though the taste was not like a chimichurri) in the way that it had a fresh, citrusy tart flavor that enhanced the flavor of the meat. I loved the seafood risotto, but I was full already part way through, which I am sad not to have finished. This is an amazing restaurant. I do not have any negatives or detractions.",

    "text": "OMG, holy crap, are you serious?,....take your pick from those as comments on Cafe Monarch. This place was incredible in every way. What do I mean? Read on....  Context: a few years ago I went to Kai for the first time. My review was 6 out of 5 stars. I didn't think I would ever again experience a restaurant that would break the Yelp star scale and make me want to downgrade every other restaurant I had ever been to in order to ensure this one is always on top. I hadn't had another experience like that until tonight! Cafe Monarch is the most beautiful, romantic, peaceful, comfortable restaurant I've ever been to. Check out my photos. The food is outstanding. Service is excellent. Value,...expensive, but worth every penny.  Atmosphere: seriously, this place is beautiful, soft, comfortable, romantic. It is clear and obvious why Cafe Monarch has been rated one of the most romantic restaurants in the country. Stone floors, intimate seating, floor length tablecloths, candles everywhere, foliage and flowers, fountains, soft peaceful music, soothing smells, soft sounds of other tables chatting, arches and stone columns, warm, and soothing. Again check out my photos to see for yourself, it's hard to explain how beautiful it is across all the senses. Rating: 11 out of 10.  Service: outstanding. Not as formal and choreographed as Kai, but wait staff and wait support staff that are sincere, friendly, caring, informed, prompt, helpful and everyone on staff is \"assigned\" to ensure you are extremely well cared for. A couple small misses but each were remedied gracefully. Rating: 9.5 out of 10.  Food: HOLY!!!!!! The food was stellar!! 4 courses plus a starter course. We were a little concerned because we were told courses were \"small\". I'm a big eater and didn't leave hungry at all. Was ecstatically stuffed!! The taste combinations were sensory explosions unlike any I've ever experienced and presentations of each course was gorgeous! Quality was second to none: fresh, flavorful, local, impeccable! Quantity was perfect. I must have held 15 different bite combinations in my mouth for several minutes each, simply didn't want the taste experience to end. Since there were 2 of us, we were able to order both of the first 3 courses to try them all. Good Lord, they were all amazing! For entrees, we had the rack of lamb and the Bucatini ai Frutti di Mare - basically the best seafood combination ever served over homemade pasta. Both were unreal, seriously. Check out my photo of the menu for detailed descriptions. Since it was my birthday, we were given a complementary dessert. We were stuffed and thought there was no way we could eat it. Then they brought us butter cake with strawberry ice cream, butterscotch drizzle, homemade whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries. We suddenly realized how wrong we were and we devoured the whole thing, very unlike us, and very, very delicious. I'd do it exactly the same again. They offer an exceptional selection of alcoholic beverages and an extremely reasonably priced, quality wine list. Rating: 11 out of 10.  Overall: I cannot recommend Cafe Monarch highly enough. Kai had been our choice for important celebrations and events for the past several years. Now, there's a new restaurant at the pinnacle of fantastic and an absolute top choice for us. Do you have an important event or celebration coming up? Don't debate, don't wait, pick up the phone and make a reservation. There's likely no way you'll be sorry. Cafe Monarch is STELLAR.  Overall Rating: 12 out of 10. They are justification for a new rating system with something higher than 5 stars.",

    "text": "A friend of mine recommended Cafe Monarch after attending a Sunday Brunch. We went for dinner with a group of 6, and we had a great time! The food was fantastic, the service was great, and it is truly a unique dining experience. I've never seen or heard of anything else like it. The restaurant is charming, and Christopher is very sweet and hugely talented. I cannot gush enough about this place, so I'll keep it simple: YOU MUST GO HERE!  Details: For dinner, Chris offered one starter (an amazing summer salad), two entrees (pork and salmon) and two desserts (orange cheesecake that I will never forget and a pastry with chocolate gelatto). The price was $45, pre fixe, and the cost for corking wine was $10 per bottle, and $1 per beer. CASH ONLY! Overall, the night was pricey ($120 for two people), but definitely worth it for a special night out with friends, or an important occasion.",

The hostess and other workers (one in particular, name escapes me) were both unprofessional and as a result I will do my best to steer friends and clients from eating at Cafe Monarch going forward.  It's amazing what word of mouth can do to hurt a reputation.  Maybe management should discuss with staff the importance of a first impression.",

    "text": "More than a restaurant, Cafe Monarch is a Phoenix must-do-before-you-die. As every review proclaims, Chris is a culinary maven who makes every experience unique and custom to the preferences and tastes of his clientele.  This is by no means a large restaurant; the dining room fits maybe 5-7 small tables with views of the chef at work constructing off the cuff dishes. And while the idea is that you sit close together with other people--this is a neighborhood restaurant after all, you don't feel crammed among strangers.  Definitely make reservations for dinner and be sure to tell Chris about any dietary restrictions. We stopped in for brunch yesterday at 11:30 but were easily enticed by the lunch menu displayed on the daily chalk board. Gruyere and cheddar grilled cheese with spicy chipotle tomato soup was the perfect meal for a wintery afternoon. Still hungry? Sure! Chris whipped up a chicken dish, lightly seasoned with chopped eggplant and sweet black rice which was enough for 2 but technically was for us to \"split\" only charging us for 3 plates total. A choice of iced tea or Cafe du Monde coffee was offered and we chose the iced tea infused with hibiscus and other fruity flavors, perfectly flavored yet unsweetened.   Dinner runs about $50 a plate and bunch/lunch $20. Cash ONLY and BYOB ($10 corkage fee).   Perfect for out of town guests, special occasions or if just you're craving delectable food. Even though it's becoming well-known, it feels like a secret place you discover every time you go.",

You feel as though you are in Chef Chris' own kitchen and the staff is so welcoming.  This is NOT a dinner that is rushed.  I am not sure why some reviewers were upset that they didn't get their food in a more timely manner - my fiance and I had such a great time talking and drinking in between each course.  There was no pressure for the table to be turned over, the staff wasn't looming over us waiting to drop the check.  How awesome is that?!  Each course was timed perfectly and every bite was fantastic.  We were served a three course meal based on our preferences discussed in the initial reservation phone call.  At the end of the night, Chef also let us sample one of the other entree option.  The food was phenomenal.  It was great, as well, to be able to bring in our own bottle of wine and champagne to accompany dinner.  The restaurant is BYOB and cash only.  Don't let the negative reviews sway you from the amazing evening that awaits you at Cafe Monarch.  THANK YOU Chef Chris and staff! It was truly a special evening.",

Chef Christopher rarely serves the same thing twice. He's so innovative and comes up with the best flavor profiles. Loved the ribs - they were so rich and fell off the bone.  The sauce and the polenta were amazing.  Every dessert I've had there has been amazing too.  Usually something involving a fruit but also chocolate, which seems to be a must when you go there.   Talk to Chef Christopher.  He is a very  humble chef .  His talents are top-notch and really haven't been met by any other valley restaurants I've been to.",

Having just rolled into town for a work trip, we showed up before the day's menu had yet been written on the chalkboard. We were content to enjoy the serene ambiance over cups of cold water and a mug of chickory coffee as the chef chose the day's offerings and began prepping in the little kitchen that juts out into the dining area. The chef was friendly and fun, chatting with us and the other patrons that trickled in as the morning grew longer.   Of the four or so dishes, I chose a grilled cheese with gruyere and a tomato basil salad, my companion a salad with roasted pears and prosciutto. I can promise it's not hyperbole when I say that this was the most wonderful meal I've had in a long time! The tomatoes were divine, the basil abundant and I don't even know what was in the dressing, but it was amazing.   The greatest feature of this restaurant--besides the delicious food--is the chef, who is also host and server. He gave me a little tag with a butterfly stamped in blank ink as a souvenir on my way out the door. How could he know this is just the type of thing I save in little boxes or tuck into books to remember my excursions?   I also enjoyed the charming decor with its the blue-tinted Ball jars, casement windows and pewter plates mounted on the wall. It felt a little French provincial--cozy and casual, yet elegant. Truly, there's some kind of magic about Cafe Monarch, which you'll have to discover yourself.",

Cafe Monarch is nestled in Old Town Scottsdale on the west side of Scottsdale RD off 1st Ave. The food for one thing is absolutely divine! We ordered from the fixed menu in which we had sea bass and a filet.I can't praise  this place enough about the food & the ambiance. They do not buy nor serve frozen fish and meats! Everything is fresh and so perfectly presented on your plate you will think it is a work of art!  The  service is impeccable! I heard a man from North Dakota owns the place and his son runs it. I don't know the owner nor the staff personally, so this review is real! Make reservations because I am not the only one obviously that has found out about this great eatery! Busy place. Worth the wait if you have to wait for a table. The prices are a little high  but not bad considering the value and exquisite service and food. They have a great wine list!  Make this a great 'date' destination! It's a sexy place!",

One of the things I miss about San Francisco (just moved to Phoenix in Summer of 2010) are the small eateries with lots of personality.  They are difficult to find in this area.  Well, Cafe Monark fits that description perfectly.  Very small tucked away nicely in a quiet corner in the Oldtown.    The owner is the greeter, chef, waiter and cashier.  The place only has about 20 seats.  The food is excellent and from what I can tell the set menu changes regularly.  Lastly, it's BYOB with a $10 corkage.  So, for the caveat, it can be slow.  That what makes it unique (run completely by the owner) can make it slow.  However, come with a nice bottle or two and enjoy the place.  The food is worth the wait and the experience is certainly unique.",

Here is wear the royal service started. They met us at the door of our Uber and welcomed us with a giant umbrella.  Walked us straight to our table, asked us if it was acceptable and seated us. Apologized for the weather and told us not to be disappointed.  They would make our night the most memorable.  Never ever have my wife and I had such a fabulous experience. Our waiter Sam explained the evening to us in a way to completely make us comfortable. Each course was explained and brought out at a pace to allow us to have a nice slow romantic conversation.  We decided to have Sam do a pairing for us. The wines were as great as the courses. Each mouthful of drink or food had such a variety of fantastic flavors it was incredible. I can honestly say after 30 years this is the most incredible, romantic, wonderful evening my wife and I have ever experienced. Thank you MONARCH.  I definitely recommend this place. REMEMBER you get what you pay for. This place really delivers.",

The waiter was the best kind of attentive, he came over to serve our dishes, five mins later to check on the food and then ten mins later to refill the wine glasses.  The place is cash only and BYOB, but we had done the research and were aware of this ahead of time.  I got the sea bass which was TO DIE FOR and my husband got the steak, which was also FANTASTICO!  Chef Christopher was amazing, he even showed me how me made a couple of the sides so I could duplicate at home.  I will definitely be sending my parents here for their anniversary and anyone else who wants a nice meal.",

    "text": "Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)  It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory?   So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate (\"Um, I don't eat anything green...\") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.  The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal.   Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours.   Let's wrap it up: -Don't bring picky eaters. -Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill. -Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours. -Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun. -Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)  I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.",

Its a one man show - Christopher runs this place and handles 'everything' by himself.He is very cordial and welcoming  2. Its BYOB.I noticed Chris helping guests with their bottles i.e opening it for the,serving it as well..I didnt expect that so i appreciate him for that 3. You will have only 2 options--Sweet ( Baked Lemon ) or Savory ( Egg Stratta that has mushroom,goat cheese,aspargus tomato )..Each plate $20 flat.Also includes a drink of your choice..I had a really nice 'Aqua Fresca'..Its like a fruit punch.He also had green tea , coffee, hibiscus tea.Bdw these 2 options are different every day :-) 4. Cash only  I luved the decor of the place..very neat & clean  , limited seating indoor ( around 5 two seater tables and 1 four seater ) . Also has outdoor seating.  I will surely go back there soon !!",

He ran his restaurant with a smooth efficiency. Busy as a bee but filled with purpose.    My dish of turkey with cranberry sauce, julienned apples, mandarin oranges, mixed greens, and bread chips reflects everything about this man's cooking. He understands flavors and cohesiveness. He also has an eye for beauty, each part of my plate reflected his attention to color and detail.  My mom had made Korean food for Thanksgiving instead of the traditional stuff. But thanks to Chris I still got my Thanksgiving fix, in a gourmet way. It was nice having the best of both worlds. I had a lot to be thankful for.",

    "text": "First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner.   The atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking.   As for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.  All in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.  ** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate.   Again, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!",

    "text": "During a visit to Scottsdale we joined the few, the proud, the happy diners who have had a chance to experience Cafe Monarch! (Apologies to the USMC for co-opting their recruiting slogan.)   This venture is truly a labor of love for chef / owner Christopher whose passion for his endeavor shows in every detail from the ambiance to the food to the service.   Arriving a little early for our 6 pm reservations, we had a chance to speak with a couple of Christopher's friends who dropped by to see him.  We learned he created Cafe Monarch out of what was formerly a beauty salon. In fact, Christopher also shared that earlier in the week he had been working to replace an interior door and make some other changes. A never ending \"adventure\" of putting the stamp of character on Cafe Monarch.   Normally we might start a review with a discussion of the food we enjoyed, but the Cafe Monarch experience is so much centric to the persona of the owner that it might be best to start there. Christopher is a charming man with a convivial style.  Plus, he is a talented chef and does all the menu planning, shopping and cooking. No assistants or sous chef here. (In discussion with him, we learned we can thank his mom for his great cooking skills...in that he needed to learn to cook for self preservation!)   He is also an accomplished host who serves the meals and circulates during the evening to make certain that his guests, whether dining inside or outside, have what they need.   On the evening we arrived, there was pecan wood burning in two outdoor free standing fireplaces, offering a wonderful aroma and which would provide warmth of temperature and ambiance both for those who arrived and elected to dine outside as the evening evolved. We chose to sit inside where we could soak up the eclectic charm of the restaurant and enjoy watching Christopher at his craft in the kitchen. A nice couple from Washington state came in and sat alongside us and in enjoying an evening of delightful conversation with them, we all marveled at Christopher \"in action\".   Our dinner that evening started with a salmon appetizer that included thick (poached?) nuggets of fish served with a slice of grilled eggplant (unique combination and worked well) along with fresh herb pesto, capers and a slice of good, grilled crostini. We all agreed it was delicious and the serving size so generous we could have stopped there and been happy. But there was more to come in a choice of two entree selections, one was slices of pork served with a fresh mango salsa and citrus sauce and the other chicken paillard served on a bed of creamy polenta with cheese and surrounded by a lovely pool of tomato sauce. All of the seasonings were just right as was the temperature of the food at service. We finished the meal with a baked Bosc pear topped with wonderful warm chocolate sauce and puff pastry dusted with confectioners sugar.  As others have shared, there is no liquor license here, so you'll have a chance to bring your own bottle of wine (we love being able to do that and to be able to share it, as we could on this evening,with the couple next to us.) Bring cash as our understanding is Christopher does not take \"plastic\". To plan for the cash, we'll share that our dinner that evening, that we think included a $10 fee for corkage, was $98 or so, including tax, for two people.   On our next visit to Scottsdale, we hope to be able to have lunch at Cafe Monarch and sit outside to enjoy Christopher's hospitality and great food again.   A closing note for this review is to mention accessibility. We have a heightened awareness of that issue of late and also note that the NY Times has included accessibility comments for some time in their reviews,with a renewed focus after food critic Frank Bruni had a favorite dining companion start to use a wheelchair. While Cafe Monarch is on one level, there is a step up to the restaurant, all inside seating is at \"bar height\" chairs and the bathroom is not accessible for wheelchairs. As we enjoyed our evening at Cafe Monarch we thought of two friends who would love it, one an attorney and another an artist and gallery owner, but who use wheelchairs and would need to know in advance that although the Yelp tag says \"wheelchair accessible: yes\", the access here is limited.",

They have set 4 course meal menus that go for $55 per person that changes every few days. For two people you are looking at $180-200 with tips and drinks. Very pricy but for special occasions like this, well worth your money.",

    "text": "Finally, I was able to try Cafe Monarch. I've been wanting to go there for years! There was a group of 6 of us and we had made our reservation over a month in advance with a request for the patio, but it was inside seating for us. I was kinda bummed because we had heard so much about the patio, but our table was nice and felt like our own little dining room. Our food was delicious-- especially the salmon with squid ink risotto-- everyone that had that cleaned their plates. Dessert was a simple strawberry shortcake type thing, that was SO perfectly sweet and fluffy.  Love the simplicity of the very few options-- you know if they are only making a few things they are doing it right. We had a vegetarian and a gluten-free diner with us and the kitchen impressed them both by creating dishes for them that they could enjoy. Our server on the other hand was totally confused by the dietary needs and continually forget that they had them. He gave a poor representation of what was going on back in the kitchen! We did the wine pairing and he didn't bring the wine in time to drink with the food it was supposed to be paired with (every time). He couldn't remember what was in the dishes-- it was almost painful, we helped him by looking at our menus and reading them for him.   We'll go back for sure, but it IS hard to want to sign up for the same type of service experience-- I hope they can work on that because the food is money.",

Very few places in this town where you don't feel overdressed if you're wearing anything nicer than shorts and flip-flops, so this place gets huge thumbs-up for being a \"nice\" restaurant!  Service is attentive and welcoming, but not overbearing. The patio is just lovely. The food was yummy, but -- surprisingly -- NOT uniformly fabulous. The soup and salad were outstanding, as were the totally decadent foie gras and desserts. Entrees, though, fell short. Hubby's ribeye was actually chewy and his veg was so over-carmelized you couldn't recognize they were brussel sprouts. Meanwhile, my roasted beet gnocchi was also tough with little to no beet flavor.  We'll be back, and hope for better entrees next time.",

Dinner was sublime--I don't know how else to describe it.  I loved the cold zucchini soup, the salad, the crab cakes and the dessert.  The wine was superbly paired and I was able to substitute white for the red--it was wonderful with the crab and it was also 109 in Phoenix.  Friends had the filet mignon --we exchanged bites--all was wonderful.  Dinner was $55 and wine $25--It was certainly very reasonable for the quality and the quantity. One more note--the restaurant is lovely --the surroundings are delightful and truly adds to the fact that you know after the first bite--that it is going to be a magical and wonderful evening.",

I should not be writing this review because it will make it much harder for us to get reservations, but, Cafe Monarch deserves so much praise for the quality of its food, its ambiance, and the amazing chef and family who own the establishment. The food is absolutely terrific, highest quality and incredible preparations. The menu is unique, you have a choice of two different entrees each evening, and the appetizer, salad and dessert are part of the meal...the price is an excellent value. Their wine selections are unique, all excellent. We went with friends who were wine experts, they did not recognize many of the selections, but found some great offerings. It was fun to find small vineyard offerings and discover new wines. The dining areas are intimate, we especially love eating in the outside area, a garden setting where you are transported to someplace lush and secluded..You would never know you are in downtown Scottsdale. What more can I say?",

She's pretty well traveled so I wanted to find something that would take us out of \"Arizona\" instead of the usual Maestros or Sam Fox concept which I love but I wanted something more unique and special. I love the pre-fix menu options because I'm super picky and it forced me to try new things, she's the opposite so she loved it all. The patio was something out of a Hollywood movie set from a romantic movie but still cool enough to be able to enjoy dinner with the fellas. The candles all around made the ambiance righteous, I couldn't help but feel like we were in another country. Each of the four courses was simply amazing. Each plate was perfect in size and the presentation was bar none. The staff and owner were fantastic. We loved every moment there. Thank you for such a memorable experience!",

We just had a cancellation he said at 7:30. Amazing, since this place takes orders 4 weeks in advance.  We were seated in a small area.  Table for two.  All by ourselves.  View of the moon and stars.  Occasionally saw waiters filling jugs of water and so forth, but no big deal.  I felt like I was in Europe.  Dinner. Amazing,  the review would be too long to write, but when I shared with friends they said amazing... Sounds like your house nick.  I chuckled saying yeah, pretty much.  Beautiful preparations, beautiful service, had a level three sommelier attend to our needs. Dinner was filling and real of the old country.    Two things.  They are NOT BYOB.  They do take CREDIT CARDS.  Don't listen to the previous reviews.  Will we return.  No doubt the most original concept for cuisine if you want a real memorable meal.  Thanks Christian and Steven for making 39 years old a memorable year.",

I wouldn't be surprised if his motto wasn't \"if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.\" Undoubtedly, he would wash dishes and bus tables if he could. The fact that he cannot control every second of the customer's experience is visibly painful.  The night's main course was salmon or chicken. Crippled by indecision, I finally landed on the boneless, skinless chicken, with a smear of asiago cheese, basil and garlic rolled in prosciutto. This coiled beauty lay napping in a pool of fresh corn polenta with aromatic tomato basil fennel sauce.  Cafe Monarch truly takes comfort food to the next level. My first bite was akin to stepping into a warm bath. Even the tap water tasted like home; a farm that I never grew up on. Truly honest, rustic food.  No visit to Cafe Monarch would be complete without a little chat from the Chef. He personally thanks every one of his customers for coming in and tucks away their comments and feedback for later analysis. The conversations are never disingenuous, but always intriguing. In between tiny sips of hibiscus tea from what appears to be a squat ceramic container that you store kitchen utensils in, he is quietly studying you and plotting his next meal.",

Everything from the gardens, the attractiveness from the outside to the magical setting inside renders the restaurant beautiful.  My wife wanted a special plate of vegetables for the main course and the chef came out personally to understand what she might like.  The food is really delicious with portions that are just right.  The starter which was a crab soup (more crab with a white corn sauce) was delectable.  The salad, first rate and delicious.  My daughter and I had the Ribeye and the Filet and shared.  Both were amazing but we preferred the Ribeye.  My only disappointment is the cost.  It's an A+ restaurant but comes at a A+ price.  For 2 adults and a teenage daughter having ordered two cocktails and the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu our meal cost us $350 after tip.  That's an expensive night out--which means this has to be a special occasion restaurant rather than one we go to every other week.  I would have preferred a lower price and more frequent visits--because it really is delicious.",

We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.    The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner/chef charged us a corking fee.   We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.  When making the reservation, the owner/chef/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that  I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.  I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.  Unfortunately, I will not visit Cafe Monarch again.",

First time I've cleaned my plate in years! :) We sat outside in the charming patio and had a fabulous time. The service and atmosphere were so nice!

    "text": "Woohoo is right!  We've been coming here for a couple of years and came on Sat night for my birthday. Upon arrival find that Christopher has finished his renovations and had a beautiful new dining room and best of all, a new space on an outdoor patio, complete with fountain and heaters, where we elected to dine. As usual, the food was outstanding and service good. We do find however, that we miss talking with Christopher during the meal, but understand that it's just not possible with all the new tables. We wouldn't go anywhere else for a special occasion or just when you want a special & intimate place,  and great food. Too many times you pay too much for just okay food, so it's a treat to get great food for a fair price. Do yourself a favor and try Monarch Cafe.....you'll love it as much as we do.  Mike & Niki S.",

Somewhat grumpy 'reception' by the hostess (I don't think we saw her smile once) and it took them quite a while to seat us even though we were already late. We immediately had to ask them to put out a heavily scented candle in the reception area near our table which I've never seen in a fine dining restaurant. Sommelier/waiter was charming and knowledgeable. Cauliflower soup was wonderful. All dishes were very refined although we thought the Sea Bass was a bit more oily than usual. Overall the best food we've ever had in Scottsdale!",

He works very swiftly and efficiently with just one server running the food. He shared that he was a Northwestern graduate, and Cafe Monarch was his creative outlet.   The 3-course dinner was amazing!! Our first course consisted of eggplant tapenade with perfectly cooked asparagus and buttery toast. The portions were huge.   Next, we were given an option between salmon with sweet corn and spinach or pork tenderloins with Japanese cashew rice. The salmon was delicious.   Chris not only created a wonderful meal, he entertained us with his witty jokes and keen sense of intuition. We were celebrating our friend's bachelorette so he asked us to go around and share one word about her. He added his own observation: compassion. He couldn't be more spot on about her and I know she really appreciated his thoughtfulness.  It's byob with $10 corkage/bottle. I would definitely return the next time I visit Scottsdale.",

We asked the Chef about the sauce and  He told us how he makes it and offered to send some home with us.  Unfortunately, we  are traveling so couldn't  even take our left overs.  We will definitely go back especially knowing that you can call in a reservation and speak with the Chef about any food allergies, etc. and he will accommodate!!  We also like that you can BYOB!!

Stopped by on a Wednesday evening (which is apparently a new night for them as they were only open Thurs - Sun) and were able to be seated immediately.  In fact, it was pretty empty.  The courtyard area is very cozy / romantic / beautiful.  I love the atmosphere!  The starter (squash with burrata and other yummy things) was delicious!!!  For the main, I chose the fish (choices were between fish and pork) and it was good - not great.  I still ate it all, but I've had better.  The dessert was also very good.  Overall, it was a great meal and experience.  I liked only having to decide on my main and wine.  The \"host\" seemed very passionate and knowledgeable about the food and was very friendly.  (I think we offended him when one person from our table asked for salt - which isn't a negative thing, it just shows their passion / confidence in their food!).",

Each course had its creative elements in addition to simply tasting great. My wife had the sea bass and I had the steak. Both were extremely good. Although it could be viewed as a bit costly ($65 per person), the pre-fix wines were of very high quality and paired well for each course. Some of the wines were of very limited availability and would carry a high tariff. However, considering we had a total of 4 glasses, it was justifiable. The interior is quite unique and interesting. All together, it was a wonderful evening!",

Completely unpretentious, its like going to a friend's house for dinner who is also an amazing cook. So, hands down 5 stars for atmospere. Now, onto the food:  1) chef/owner makes what he wants to make. Be ok with it and you won't be disappointed 2) three courses, prix fixe for $45/person plus $10 corkage. Byob cuz there's none at the restaurant (a great deal if you ask me) 3) make reservations! On the night that we were there, he had one seating-that's it. We felt very special as we watched Chris turn down several walk-ins. 4) what we ate:  Tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich-the best tomato soup-EVER, perfect consistency, a nice garlic kick. Grilled pork tenderloin-my dish, very tasty, over bed of japanese black rice. So good! Scallops with bacon-lots of scallops, lots of bacon, good flavor Strawberry tart-remember-it's Feb in Arizona and I was having a hard time finding good strawberries. These were better than good.  Remember-the chef is the owner, the owner is the chef so if you call during lunch or dinner, chances are, he's cooking. We usually love trying new places and don't often repeat, but this one we will.",

It's prix fixe, $45, plus drinks. We enjoyed the salad and then had the two choices for entree - scallops and pork osso buco. Each dish was prepared perfectly, and the desert was excellent, too. The waiter was good - and the only quibble is that that fellow picking up plates as we finished stopped 3 times to ask if we were done, when we were clearly not. Once is fine, 3 times is not good training. The bill came just as I took my last sip of coffee - also a bit rushed. Everything else was well paced and done well, and the rest of the evening was wonderful. Enjoy! Recommended for a special evening.",

I happen to be gluten sensitive and the restaurant accommodated me well, even with a gluten free crab cake! That said, the salad around the crab cake was too sweet. The waiter didn't seem familiar enough with the total ingredients as I mentioned to him that I didn't like sweetness in my savory food. Anyway, looking beyond that one shortfall, the food was flavorful and served hot when it was supposed to be. I like that very much because too many restaurants fall short on that one very important detail. My only beef with this restaurant is the old fashioned styling of the venue. For the caliber of eatery, it needs a refresh. Old World 70s 80s interior design has no place in a modern, expensive restaurant. I think they should consider a full interior makeover and every table will be filled with a waiting list. (ahem, manager who reads this, contact me to be considered for the refresh)",

Initially after my first visit I though that perhaps it was the perfect spring Arizona weather, fluffy clouds, light breeze, the sunset sky with orange and purple hues that made the out door ambiance magical.  Our next visit in the throws of the summer heat was just as magical.    The hostesses greeted us warmly on both occasions as did most of the staff as we walked towards our outdoor seats.  Nothing in Phoenix, and I mean nothing, compares to the outdoor seating here. The candles, the trees, the shrubbery, the eclectic music, the misters, the hidden nook and crannies with hidden seating-everything just works.   The menu is essentially fixed with a few choices of salads and main meals.  The wine list is excellent.  Service is spot on and not intrusive. The price point is high but well worth it.    The food obviously is star as my photos will attest to.  I can not wait for my third visit.",

The atmosphere was very romantic. I can see why they were voted the #1 most romantic restaurant in the USA by Yelp. It was very worth the visit for our special engagement.",

Very complex flavors and impeccable service with the every server having an excellent knowledge of the wine pairings.   This is a fine dining experience so please respect the restaurant and dress the part!  It's a nice night out  A word of warning:  if you do the complete wine pairing, plan on using a car service!  They do not pour a small glass!!!",

I opted to have the tuna tartare and gnocchi apps instead of a full meal and I was not disappointed. We also split a burrata and had a house cordial. They also make their own alcohol which is so fun! We dined on the romantic patio that was lined with bushes and twinkle lights. The waiter was friendly and made great suggestions, even bringing us some samples. Fun night and I will be back again soon!",

From all the places that i have been to, this was the best tasting water i had all week. I finally got that funky taste out of my mouth from the crappy tasting water and was indulged by some fruit flavored water. What a great start to a wonderful and expensive dinner.  The price on the menu includes a full four course meal. Oh...boy, was i hungry. I was glad that the price included four courses. I was first spoiled with a butternut squash soup with a fried piece of goodness in the middle. (Sorry chief, i didn't take a picture of the menu and i have a bad memory on all the goodness that i ate.) The portions was small, but i was glad that it was because i was heading for a four course meal. with three-four spoon fulls, i was done and was waiting for more.   Next up was the salad. I never fell so much in love with the salad, coming from someone who loves meat. I mean even the lady at the next table was having loud foodgasims. It was a bit awkward, but the timing was perfect from what i was thinking in my head. It was arugula with some type of vinaigrette, a piece of juice watermelon with blue cheese, and a wonton crisp. Simple, but delicious.  Course number 3...the entree. The main course of the meal and the hero...the filet mignon. This hero was so tender and flavorful that my fork was jealous. As soon as i cut the meat, my fork had a piece, then it was gone. This pattern would repeat until it was all gone. The hero even brought his friends: a sweat potatoe puree, grilled asparagus, portabello mushroom slices, and crispy onions on top. It was a perfect harmony for the hero and his friends for my fork and my tummy.  Finally, the last course of the night was dessert. The one meal of the day that i wasn't too fond of. I did however like the ice cream. The vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal.   An overall great food experience.",

The food was not as impressive as expected. I had the shrimp fra biablo and there was no spice. Our cappuccinos came with a packet of sugar..most higher end establishments use sugar cubes.  We were not offered a choice of dessert although it was a good cake. Small things but they don't go unnoticed. We had 2 dinners in Scottsdale, one at Kai and one at Cafe Monarch, and Kai was the clear winner. If you're looking for a True culinary experience go to Kai, but Cafe Monarch is a good option in old Scottsdale for a decent dinner in a beautiful building.",

My only problem was the food itself underwhelmed me a little. The starter courses wrere fabulous then came a salad that was very meh except for the candied bacon that was delicious the other ingredienta (some grana padano and a bitter dressing) not so much. My husband has a steak that was just okay nothing memorable and I had some scallops and they came over some lentil based and it was just underwhelming , they were well cooked but the other ingredients didn't  mesh al well. Their dessert was complimentary for our anniversary and  it was a phenomenal rum cake.

I cannot believe it has taken me this long to come here but this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. If you don't know, Cafe Monarch is a family owned and operated upscale dining establishment nestled in an unassuming Scottsdale neighborhood.  The restaurant itself has a very homey, intimate feel. We were lucky enough to get a table for two outside and the weather was incredible. The decor was simple and beautiful; you really did feel like you were in a secret garden.  The prix fixe menu changes constantly so you never know what you're going to get. For my first course I had the roasted cauliflower soup with truffle oil and pine nuts adding a delicate balance of flavor. Second course was a spring salad with compressed watermelon. Simple and beautifully presented. The third course was the lollipop lamb chop that was cooked perfectly medium rare and melted in your mouth. I opted for the cast iron filet mignon served with caramelized shallot butternut squash pave, crispy Brussel sprouts, with a beef jus emulsion. This was definitely one of the most memorable steaks I have ever had. Not only was the presentation on point but it was perfectly seared and tender.   As far as I know, Cafe Monarch is the only restaurant in Arizona whose servers are all trained sommeliers as well. This adds an excellent element of service to the entire dining experience as the wine paring is perfect. Our servers and their assistants were all so attentive without being overbearing. I cannot wait to be back and see what incredible food they have to offer!",

The ambiance is absolutely perfect - this is a perfect date night or event location - and the design is rather unique. The service is absolutely phenomenal in every way - our server, Brendan, was basically a mind-reader, and the sommelier (a member of the sommeliers guild, no less) definitely knew his stuff.   The food was perfect, and I really mean that. It began with a sweet potato and pumpkin soup, which was savory and perfectly accented with a bit of cinnamon. The appetizer, a salad with blood orange and prosciutto, was possibly the best I have ever had in every sense. The filet mignon was, of course, transcendent - perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly accented by an amazing sauce. The dessert, a rum cake, accented the end of the meal perfectly.   Alcohol-wise, this place rocks. The wine was expertly paired and added to the meal significantly.  The cocktails were also excellent - I had the \"Winter Wonderland,\" which mixed delicious mint and cranberry with herbs and other delicious tastes.   Needless to say, this is possibly the best restaurant I have ever eaten at - and I've eaten at a lot.",

My bf gave them a heads up that I was a vegetarian, but other than that, the entire meal was a surprise.  It was exciting because we didn't get menus, we just sat down with our bottle of wine and were asked if we were ready for our first course. That's a good indication of what's to come if the chef if is that confident in his food that he assumes you will like what's on the menu... and we DID!  We started with a grilled pear, brie and walnut salad served with a cranberry citrus vinaigrette, the flavors were excellent, it was something I've never paired together.  For our entree I had a bean sprout patty topped with grilled eggplant and a mushroom sauce. The sauce was amazing!  I am actually going to try to make it myself this week.   I'm not a huge fan of bean sprouts, so if I would have seen a menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it, but then would have missed out on some fabulous flavors!  So, I guess I do like bean sprouts =).   We sat out on the patio, which was candle lit and cozy.  I think sitting inside would have been a fun experience too, but less romantic.  Inside has a few tables and a small completely open kitchen.  It reminds going to a neighbor's house for dinner and watching him cook.  The whole dining experience is very inviting, and the food is unique and excellent.   We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Welcome to another secret garden of Old Town Scottsdale. Are you wondering where Cafe Monarch is located? Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater.   When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want.   I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it.   I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch.   Some things to note before you visit:  - Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16.   - BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some \"quality\" booze   - Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there.",

The brie had a little toasting to it which was a nice touch. Then for the main course we had the filet and salmon, both cooked to perfection. Dessert was a nice puff pastry. But what made the experience even more amazing was the service. At the end of our meal we were greeted by the owner, Christian, who was very personable and friendly. He gave us a tour of his kitchen which was adorable. Our waiter, Jeff, chatted with us for a while about travel and food which was awesome. He also recommended Mabel's on Main afterward and we ended our evening on a wonderful high. I would absolutely recommend Cafe Monarch for anyone looking to fall in love or rekindle some passion!",

Chef Chris was a warm and funny host, who kept us on our culinary toes, in terms of surprising us with innovative and beautiful dishes that were packed full of flavor.  We have family in Arizona, and now we have two great reasons to visit!  Thanks Chef Chris for a wonderful evening!",

You get 3 courses prepared basically right next to you by the chef.  There really is no menu to choose from which I thought was cool, just what the chef gets from the market that day and decides to create.  We had a beef dish which was fantastic and we got lucky sitting next to him.  He had some extra shrimp left over from another dish he made and let us try it, it was amazing too.  Just a very cool/different dining experience.  Don't expect a quick, rushed dinner.  Just sit back, drink some if the wine you brought, and enjoy the experience.",

The weather was cool and he had a couple of outdoor fireplaces going with fragrant pecan wood. We had the whole place to ourselves outside!  It was very romantic.  The food was simply outstanding--we placed ourselves in his oh so capable hands!! We are already looking forward to going back with some friends.  Plan ahead on your dates and you will not be sorry!!  This special place has been discovered.  Enjoy the experience!!",

He was very welcoming and friendly. I think it's amazing he does everything! We had a large group of 8 which can be overwhelming for a small place, but he was very gracious and managed to accommodate us and we had the dishes served family style which worked out well. Definitely recommended. As the other reviews state, this place is a one man show, so be prepared to wait. But when you have great friends, great food, and a beautiful day, it's time well spent to slow down and savor the experience.",

    "text": "Saturday brunch at  Cafe Monarch in Old Town Scottsdale is truly extraordinary!   As a \"foodie\" who has eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, I hardly expected to have one of the greatest meals of my life at a tiny, off-the-beaten-path cafe in Scottsdale.   Even more amazing than the fresh, bright, and innovative flavors, attention to detail and quality of the food - is the whole operation is a one man show.   Yet, Chef Christopher manages to pull off a meal equal to that of a five star restaurant...all while waiting tables, answering the phone, cooking and charming guests.      The menu is different every day and limited, so between four of us, we ordered one of everything on the menu.   I had the most moist, delicious pork chop with a sweet chili sauce, simple salad and French style omelet and shoestring fries.   We also ordered the goat cheese panini  sandwich (with grilled vegetables and dried cranberries) and savory salmon with tomatoes and cream.   Each dish was  fresh, simple and prepared to utter perfection.   The coffee was bold, rich, hot and delicious.   We sat inside and talked to Chef Chris while he prepared food (the kitchen is open and in the middle of the restaurant).    Be prepared for a unique, fresh, dinning experience that is truly unlike anything you will find anywhere else.  Of note, it is cash only and BYOB.   Will be eating again here soon (this weekend)!",

We were sat at 6:45 and ordered drinks which came out pretty quickly. We ordered our entree's soon after.Our first 3 courses came out prompt and the cauliflower soup was spectacular. This is the main reason I am giving 3 stars. After we finished our first 3 courses it was about 7:15. There were 2 tables around us getting their courses at about the same time. Both tables got their entrees about 15-20 minutes later. We were still waiting. The other 2 tables got their dessert and coffee. We were still waiting. Both tables paid and left and we were still waiting. Finally our waiter came over and told they had a christmas party and the kitchen was backed up which we found questionable since we ordered at the same time as the other 2 tables who had already been gone 15 minutes. We finally get our food around 8:15. The broccolini was cold. The scallops were room temperature. The chicken was luke warm. Really disappointing. Our drinks and scallops were comped but it didn't really make up for not warm food and mediocre service on my birthday. If everything had been great we would have come back again. Now we won't.",

    "text": "An Oasis in the Desert!  My girlfriend and I have been meaning to try out this place for about a year now. Her and her fiance are moving to Australia next week so I sent her a text telling her we have to have a going away dinner and we had to try this place out before she left! So we double dated and all 4 of us were blown away.  We had a table in the courtyard which is just simply amazing. The word that kept coming to mind with the decor was \"quaint\" I don't know if that is the right word but I can't think of a better one! Loved it. You get a 4 course meal for $55 which for the quality and atmosphere is very reasonable. We all elected to add the $25 for the wine pairing (3 wines).  Each week is a brand new menu! One of the things that I loved was since there were no decisions to make except your meat (It is a pre fixed meal and you choose one of the 2 entree dishes) I tried ingredients and dishes I might have skipped over under other circumstances.   The Food-  We started with an Amuse Busch (spelling?) which was Lobster and Ricotta stuffed squash blossoms with a tomato curry sauce- FANTASTIC! Our next course was a watermelon and yellow beat salad with marcona almonds and a lemon vinaigrette - all the ingredients were so fresh.   For dinner my boyfriend got the Halibut and I got the Ribeye so we could try each dish. Normally I am not a big fish fan, not that I dislike it, I just like meat better! But this Hazelnut-Brown Butter Halibut was just superb! It was served with sauteed Wild Ramps, Roasted Sweet Corn, Forbidden Rice, Red Quinoa and Couscous, Cockle Clam Vinaigrette. It was served in a sort of \"patty\" next to the fish. All of it went great together! The Ribeye was sooooooo tender! Would give any steakhouse a run for their money! It was a 4 chili rubbed Ribeye (I ordered mine Medium Rare Plus and it was perfect). It was served sliced instead of whole and came ontop of a potato Leek-Lobster Hashbrown that has mushrooms and spinach in it. The other couple did the same thing (splitting the 2 meals) and were as equally estastic about it!  For desert we a White Chocolate Key Lime Tart with a Raspberry Sorbet. It was the perfect end to the meal!  For the Wines-   Our Amuse Busch and First Course was served with a French Chardonnay which complimented both dishes great. The Napa Blend (Hahn) was OUTSTANDING! I even ordered another glass and took note of the name so I could purchase it for my home! The dessert was accompanied with a desert white white served in a champagne glass, seemed like a cross between a Muscato and an ice wine but this was the only wine they didn't bring the bottle out for and I never asked what it was. We decided at the end of our meal to order a round of champagne to toast their moving to Australia and to Cheers to our fantastic evening at Monarch Cafe!   All of it was just superb and service was spot on! Will definitely be back!",

Although the staff could probably tell that we weren't used to the this kind of dining they were all super friendly and were knowledgeable about the menu. They also were great with accommodating to me being vegetarian and were well rehearsed in what I could enjoy. The atmosphere makes you forget you are in Scottsdale, Arizona and transports you to Rome or Tuscany. There was only one thing that my friend and I found a little weird. The hostesses, who was very friendly and well mannered, would not stop smiling for the life of her. I understand that they want to appear as friendly as can be but I became worried that they took her soul or something. It was robotic like to have this person walking with a  full tooth smile plastered on their face and it never wavering . I imagine her face has to hurt at the end of the night. Overall, my experience here was amazing and I definitely recommend.",

We sat outside, the twinkle lights are abundant and everything about the decor screams quaint European  which always appeals to me. I would have been happy to give 5 stars but unfortunately I was disappointed with our server (sorry I have forgotten his name). He was friendly and knowledgeable but slow on our orders and when we arrived it was not very busy. I noticed that every table had a flower in the middle except ours and our candle was not lit. So I asked if he might light our candle and possibly bring me a flower. He did light the candle but never brought me a flower. He also did not check on us throughout the night after he brought our meal. So, while I loved the food and ambiance, the service that we received was less than impressive.",

We checked the menu online before we made reservations to see what was on tap and the menu for the evening sounded really interesting. And it was.  It was $55 a person for the four courses and it was worth every penny. Our service was excellent and since we went a little early, we had the place to ourselves for almost an entire hour.

The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star was because each time  they delivered our food or wine it was set in front of the wrong person.  Taking a sip of Riesling when you ordered Chardonnay was unexpected. It was not a big deal and didn't ruin our experience, but when you spend a lot of money this shouldn't repeatedly happen.

Recently I saw it on Open Table and found they had reopened.  Alas, it is not the same place at all.  No more BYOB, which was fab, as we could enjoy a really great wine.  So now at $55 plus just for the food, it is quite expensive.  But then so are the (ugh) steak joints, soooo.  They really jammed the tables in the courtyard which is small.  The tables are tiny and you really feel crammed in.  God help a large man over 6 feet in the chairs.  The food was very interesting, a great mix of flavors but TOO SALTY.  Everything was too salty (except dessert).    NO BREAD.  For $55, can't I get some warm bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd even pay $56!!!! Some of the sauces were very tastly (except salty) and I wanted to polish them off.  Was I to lick the plate to get my money's worth?   Please, give us some BREAD!!!  They also need WARM PLATES.  So hard?  Not really.  Our main course was warm but not hot.  I want my food HOT.     Be prepared to spend $100 each for dinner.  My hsb thought his meat was not the quality you would get in some places, but again compared to the steak places.....  That being said, we will try it again.  The food had a very interesting mix of flavors.  Everything was interesting, and would be outstanding if they lost some of the salt.",

My wife and I have eaten at many fine restaurants in Chicago, San Francisco, NOLA and this four course meal, the service, the wine pairing and the ambiance was as good as any. Sitting outside in an intimate courtyard with real candles everywhere was the perfect romantic end to a short trip to Phoenix for our Global Entry interview.",

We sat on the patio and even though it was close to hundred degrees outside the patio was about 20 cooler with the misters that they had going.   We didn't love the salad and I think it would've been great to have an option for two different kind of salads as well as the two options for the dinner entree. Other than that though everything else was perfect. Highly recommend.",

They do accommodate vegetarians, but cannot always accommodate vegans - best to check with them a week prior before. We were happy with the dining, though the desert was boring - simply fruits & I believe gelato. After paying so much, I would have liked a more creative eggless vegetarian options, especially since we notified them early.",

    "text": "Cute little cozy eatery serving up what's the best and freshest at the moment.  From the hand-written menu outside to the picturesque garden exterior, Cafe Monarch is a little gem in the heart of downtown Scottsdale.  It was a lovely late Saturday morning when we ate here, right at opening time (11 AM).  The menu for lunch is all $12.50 no matter what you get, with selections such as pork tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp, and brie with fennel.  The last two selections are what my friend and I had.  The shrimp was excellent.  It was perfectly cooked, on crispy toasted bread covered with pesto.  There were also pieces of sweet pineapple, sliced cherry tomatoes, and chopped onion to add some more color and tropical flavor.  There was a massive amount of shrimp on the plate, which made this dish a tasty and very good deal.  My friend had the brie with fennel and puff pastry (My description of this, by the way, does not do the dish justice).  All the ingredients were well prepared and very good on their own, but for me, it wasn't as good as my shrimp dish.    Drink selections include hot tea, coffee, and iced green or hibiscus tea ($3).  The hibiscus tea is very refreshing with a deep garnet color to the drink.    Our total for 2 lunch dishes and 1 iced tea was a little over $30 including tax.  This establishment is cash only, so come prepared!  P.S.  Another plus about this restaurant.  For those of you who hate scavenging for restaurant parking around downtown Scottsdale, Cafe Monarch has its own private lot.",

I won't even try to look for the words to accurately capture just how blown away we were by this place. My parent's beat us here and had dined a few times prior to us and paid for our entire meal just so we could experience it. It is not a cheap night out, but it will be one of your most memorable -- I can't emphasize that enough. From the moment we arrived and passed our keys along to the mandatory valet, to the time we walked back out to have valet recognize our faces well enough to go fetch our car without us even handing them our ticket, it was astounding. The service was impeccable. The menu was perfection. The quality of the ingredients were jaw dropping. The ambiance was like being in a totally different world (couldn't believe we were still in downtown Scottsdale given how gorgeous and private the courtyard was). I can go on forever, but please, don't spend even close to the amount of time I spent writing this thinking about whether or not to go -- GO!!!!",

    "text": "Location - In a colorful area with four other businesses.  Reservations - Required for dinner on Friday/Saturday, and recommended other times when open.  It wasn't busy at 11 am on Saturday for brunch, but you should still call.  When I called to make reservations, the owner, Christopher was very friendly and even remembered me when I arrived.  Hours of Operation - 11-3 daily and for dinner on Friday and Saturday only.  Website - N/A Payment - Cash recommended but owner will take debit/credit card. Service - Slow but very friendly.  Owner is the cook/server/manager/host.  Everything is at a leisurely pace.  Therefore, if you are expecting a quick place to dine, don't come here.  We were the first customers luckily and our meal still took about 2 hours.  When we left, one server appeared to help out Christopher. Decor/Ambiance - Very quaint decor.  Owner decorated place himself.  French country, peaceful, waterfall running in the back.  A fresh lemon and wax paper line each checkered blue table.  Relatively small place, never a line for \"seating\" but be expected to wait for food.  Price - Pricey but well worth it.  It's as close as I'll ever be to having my own personal chef.  Brunch/lunch was $20, plus we were charged a corkage fee of $10.  I believe dinner is $45/person for a three course meal that is planned that day. Food - As stated, don't eat here if you are picky.  BYOB is encouraged so we brought a bottle of champagne from the Circle K nearby. Christopher provided us with a bottle chiller and flutes.  For our meal, Christopher asked if we were interested in brunch or lunch.  There are some items on a chalkboard menu by the kitchen, but for the most part, there is no written menu.  Christopher will ask what we feel like eating and if we have any preferences or dislikes.  Then the conversations goes something like \"...okay, you would like some brunch.  How about, some French toast with fresh fruit and bacon? I can also make some fresh French roast coffee or hibiscus iced tea?\"  All the ingredients are seasonal and entrees made when ordered.  1. French toast with orange sauce, walnut cinnamon confit, fresh fruit medley and oven cooked bacon - French toast was light, crispy outside and soft inside.   Fruit was cut fresh (pineapple, banana, strawberries, grapes, oranges and a caramelized pear) and seasonally sweet.  Bacon was cooked to perfection. 2. French Roasted Coffee - Not overly strong, but great delicate taste.",

They charged us 50 dollars to open a bottle of OUR OWN WINE with the bottle opener that we bought from home. The food was good, but not amazing. We had a four course meal, and started with tomato soup and bread that was no big deal. We then had a chicken dish which was very good, followed by a beef salad and bean salad that was also good. It was 45 dollars a person which wasnt too bad. The chef was super creepy! He kept trying to cop a feel on a few of the girls we were with and they were totally creeped out by the guy. The food was good but nothing special. Our waitress was horrible and charging us to open a bottle of our own wine was ridiculous. None of us will ever go back.",

The experience and atmosphere was perfect...relaxed, friendly, warm...it felt like we had a personl chef in our home. Chef Chris was very welcoming, personable, and showed passion in his craft.

Excellent flavors from herbs, and you've never seen such fresh herbs on a plate. Professional and friendly owner. Could have huge attitude, given the demand for reservations, but doesn't. Uncorked our sparkling wine, kept it chilled, poured refills until it was all gone (we had a cab).  The restaurant is small, but not cramped, and I think some reviews make it sound like this is some sort of hole in the wall with an eccentric dining room. It is not. The decor is tasteful and warm   The kitchen is part of the room, but you can be as aware of it as you choose. Christopher had PHilip helping as a waiter, and he did a great job. The first course was super fresh and delicious salad with mint, cucumber, tomato, and other things, with a large, thin piece of flatbread, itself fantastic. We shared entrees. My poached salmon with orzo/mint?/other ingredients, and her grilled Rosemary chicken over cheesy polenta. All of it was incredible. Dessert was pastry, strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate ice cream or ganache?  Another home run. We will be back.",

Chris is very relaxed and you feel like you are a guest in his home.  I couldn't understand why the open kitchen wasn't a mess?  It was spotlessly clean.  The restaurant itself was charming and hip.  The braised ribs fell off the bone when you tried to pick them up.  I've never ever had anyhing that tender before.  The fried catfish.....delicious. The polenta, even my husband with texture issues said, \"wow, it's addicting\".   The appetizer was a bed of some sort of delicious greens and black eyed peas, topped with a huge slice of a perfect tomato and a cut of goat cheese.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  We both ate every bite.  The dessert was simple but elegant.  Fresh whipping cream, strawberries, a puddle of chocolate and puffed pastry sticks that he readily told us how to make.  He is so kind.  It was definately a 'dining' experience. ...... 2 hours.  We were getting a bit antsy just towards the end and only because we had our child with someone.  No one else was budging, even ones that had been there longer then us.  I thought the prie-fix pricing was low for what we got.  Things like the sprig of mint and a big berry in our water glass that was not only beautiful but delicious!  Considering that he is literally the only person working there, the service is fabulous.   Our water was always filled.  When dusk came we received a darling oil lamp to light our table.  Although the lighting on the porch/patio was perfect anyway.  We brought white wine so an old milk barrell with a beautiful terra cotta urn came to the the table to keep it cool.  The hip thing was that that table next to us had a wood milk crate and an urn brought for them.  The crate was turned to be open towards them and Chris put a candle down in the bottom of it and it was so hip.  He's definately got a nack for ambiance and cool. Most definately a wonderful anniversary dinner.",

Head past the intimate chef's kitchen dining room, which seats about 10, and through the gorgeous indoor restaurant that will make you feel like you're in a castle dining room, and walk out to the patio covered in candles, featuring a fountain, and ensconced with flowers. It's one of the most romantic restaurants in the Valley I've ever been to, and it re-opens Friday, October 4, after new ownership.  Every night, Cafe Monarch features a unique three-course prix fixe menu, based on seasonal items and Chef Andrew Nienke's taste. Call ahead if you have special dietary needs, and they'll adjust the menu accordingly for you.  I went there last week with some girlfriends -- thank you so much to new owner Christian Lewkowicz for the invitation -- and had one of the freshest meals I've ever had. We started with a watermelon salad, which came with huge chunks of juicy watermelon and a bed of fresh greens. I love watermelon salad, and this one was extra-tasty.  My pals had salmon and filets for their entrees, while I got to nibble on quinoa topped with fresh carrots and leeks. The portion size was huge and left me stuffed.  For dessert, we were treated to freshly baked puff pastries topped with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream. I slurped up every bite of the dessert, which was light and refreshing and managed to seem healthy because of the fruit.   My favorite part of Cafe Monarch, though, was the atmosphere and hospitality. The service was amazing and made you feel like you were in your own little world -- perfect for an anniversary dinner or special get-together. Our meals would have cost $45 each, which was a steal for such unique culinary creations and such top-notch ingredients. The relaxed atmosphere will transport you out of the Valley for a night and make you feel like you're in your own private retreat.",

Everything here gets 5 stars because of the customer service, atmosphere, food, wine, and more! This restaurant is a lovely experience and a great way to try new creative dishes. My mother and I decided to order so that we could try each dish from the prefixed menu, and nothing disappointed. Our waiter (and the other employees we talked to or passed) were charming and knowledgeable about the menu and wine. I'm a huge wine fan and appreciated that the staff was educated and informative about this. Cafe Monarch is definitely a treat for anyone wanting to try something unique in the valley. Take someone you love (friend, partner, family member) and sit back and enjoy an evening on their quaint patio with the overhead string lighting brightening your entire evening.",

I reserved a table here because it sounded like a special occasion, foodie, date night, but they had obviously overbooked, so the whole evening was extremely chaotic in the restaurant.  And because they overbooked, the rush to get us through our meal was palpable.  We had the prix fixe meal with wine pairings, and could barely finish one course's wine, before the waiter was appearing at the table, pouring the next course's wine.  On top of that, as the wine glasses piled up, they weren't taken away from our table.  As for the food, well, it was rather ordinary, except for a lovely first course gazpacho.  We could have made the salad at home with a bottled dressing, and the wine pairing was completely mis-matched.  The quid ink crepe was like a small, black tortilla filled with canned crab, and my duck entree was overcooked and uninteresting.  Finally, we had told them ahead of time that we share a birthday and were celebrating it at Cafe Monarch.  They looked embarrassed and brought us out a dessert with a sparkler.    Dear Cafe Monarch - only book enough to make each party's meal special and honor the food.",

The cauliflower soup is the best soup I've ever tasted. This was followed by a winter salad (delicious), a glorified seafood taco (also delicious) and a sea bass (incredibly delicious). The desserts were out of this world. We shared the bananas foster & the rum cake. We will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Scottsdale has too many restaurants posing as something better than they are, but their food, service and ambiance quickly disappoint.   Cafe Monarch is truly an excellent restaurant with creative food, excellent service, an impressive list of wines, and an elegant dining ambiance.  The price is high, but the quality is even higher.  Apparently, its family owned, and the family seems to have a keen interest in the details of running their restaurant.   CUISINE: The chef offered a four-course dinner menu with an add-on dessert course.  Each course was well thought out and had several options from which to choose to customize your particular dining experience.    The gentleman that served our table suggested that each person should get something different so we could enjoy the full range of each course.   We did.   Each dish was indeed excellent, but not really shareable (tapas style) so we ended up just enjoying our own choice.   Its noteworthy that everybody enjoyed everything - I'd like to commend the chef for pleasing everybody all the time (at least at our table).  Also, each course was portioned appropriately so we could enjoy the full dinner without getting too full.  WINE: The wine list was impressive in its breadth and depth.  Our server was a very knowledgeable sommelier and provided a very creative wine pairing that followed the typical arc from bubbly champagne to deep reds.   I must compliment his down-to-earth approach.  Some sommeliers take themselves too seriously and hence seem a little preachy.  This gentleman was relaxed, engaging, funny and interesting.   The pours were also generous.  Well done!  SERVICE: Service was excellent without being pretentious.  Everybody was friendly, helpful, attentive and knowledgeable.     I appreciated how they served a wide range of people - some guests were clearly wealthy experienced diners and others were not - yet they treated each respectfully and enthusiastically.  My only suggestion would be to tighten up the serving.  A restaurant of this caliber should train their staff to provide smooth, precise service - unfortunately the setting and removing was often awkward and clunky and they repeatedly confused who ordered which dish.  SUMMARY: Cafe Monarch is one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix metro area and I would personally consider near the top of my preference list of favorite restaurants in the US.  I really appreciated the cuisine, the service, and the ambiance.  They've got it all.",

Because there were two of us we got 1 of each course (there were two options for courses 1-3) and a variety selection for our entree. Everything was perfectly paired, and was so delicious!!!! Even though it's a 4 course dinner, we were perfectly timed when delivering a new course and removing the current course. I was also very happy that the portions were not undersized. We did overeat because we couldn't put our forks down, but I would LOVE to go back and I'll be a customer for life. The Rum Cake is apparently what they are known for and I could eat it all day, too! One of the best meals we've had in Arizona!",

While it is pricey, I completely believe it is worth it. Their set menu changes daily, their cocktails are unique and fresh, and their quaint patio is just adorable, fully equipped with bird houses, candles, and flowers.   Their nightly menu is typically 4 courses and you pick your main between 2 options, the other courses are set. They usually do give you the option to add-on a special treat for extra $ like lobster, scallops, etc. Their wine list is great and the dishes are bursting with flavor. I can honestly say that i've never had a bad experience at Cafe Monarch. I HIGHLY suggest going during patio season because you just can't beat the romantic ambiance outside, but inside is beautiful too!

All the flavors were just a little overwhelming after the third course. Strangely, I don't know if it was just what I chose, but everything tasted sweet. The cauliflower soup was the absolute most delicious soup I've ever ordered. The only Earthy, salty flavor I had. It was a lot of fun, but we craved salt and spice afterwards. We do not regret going at all.",

    "text": "We have been to several great eateries in the area and this tops them all. Of all the restaurants in Scottsdale none deserves a Michelin star or two more than this place does. The ambiance is elegant and romantic, especially the outdoor courtyard covered with bistro lighting, candles, and the sound of running water. This is easily the most romantic dining area I have seen in the Phoenix area.  The food is simply exceptional. I wish I had the palate to describe the flavors, but suffice it to say that they are both complex and delicious. They choose ingenious combinations which are which are bursting with flavor. And it isn't every day that you find morels on the menu.   Our dinner was served over four courses with a Yellow Tomato Gaspacho to start followed by Compressed Melon Salad. The Gaspacho was light and creamy and the salmon was so perfectly cooked that my fiancee actually ate the skin. The melon salad was just enough to keep you wanting more and the combination of flavors was out of this world.  I started with a Brooklyn cocktail and my fiancee had a glass of Sancerre. They give you plenty of time to savor the food, the ambiance, and the conversation. We later paired a Bourdeaux with the filets we both ordered.   Our waiter, Wesam, is a certified sommelier and he was excited to teach us all about the wine we were drinking, and some that we weren't. He even hand wrote a list of documentaries and films about wine that we should watch. He had the kind of knowledge about wine that only comes through both passion and experience. We will request Wesam every time we visit in the future!  The third course was a choice of between Crispy Skin Branzino and Spanish Octopus Puttanesca. We ordered one of each, I took the octopus which neither of us normally like much. We trusted the chef though, and as expected the octopus was delicious. Again, I wish I had the palate and language to describe how exquisite the flavor combinations were on both of these very different dishes.   Finally, we both ordered the the Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon. Now, I won't say that this was the best cut of steak I have ever had because it was not. But again, the combination of flavors was superb. The chef dressed things well and the morels with filet makes for a divine combination.  Dessert was probably my least favorite part of the meal. We had the rum cake and it was sort of a typical dessert. Don't get me wrong if you are actually still reading this. It was good, but not up to the standard of the rest of the meal in my personal opinion. But dessert isn't the focus of this restaurant.   I wouldn't recommend a first date here, but if you really want to impress someone special, you are both foodies, and you can talk for hours, then this is your place. There is probably nowhere more romantic in the Phoenix area than the courtyard at Cafe Monarch and the food and ambiance will make for a very memorable evening.",

    "text": "This is one of those rare places that does not feel real. I'm not saying you'll sit down and all of a sudden you will think we're all in \"The Matrix,\" or you'll walk to your table and a camera crew will ambush you because they are in the middle of filming \"Cafe Monarch: Electric Boogaloo.\" It's kind of a hard feeling to explain, really. Suffice it to say, when you're at Cafe Monarch, you almost feel like you're somewhere completely removed from the rest of the world. Yeah, it's an upscale restaurant surrounded by a neighborhood, and they are packed every night, but there is something one-of-a-kind about this place that makes each and every visit one to treasure.  My folks actually ended up here a year ago and placed it in their list of favorite dining experiences ever. So when they returned to Arizona again this year, I made sure to invite myself and see what all the fuss was about.  The most important thing I can suggest is come prepared with a reservation, preferably for the patio grotto. The second most important thing I can suggest is come hungry, because this is a multi-course meal where you basically sit back and let the chef dazzle your tastebuds. You may think something on the menu sounds odd or unfamiliar, but trust me: as soon as you shove it in your mouth, you'll be flabbergasted with flavor.  So the three of us arrive, and the valet comes over and ferries the car away. The outdoor hostess stand was cool, and the team working the desk was made up of very welcoming and friendly hostesses. In fact, my first impression was that this place has so much charm, it may even make me look like a functioning member of society. When we were guided to our seat outside, we passed through a few dining rooms and got to see all kinds of homely touches that let you know this place has never met a stranger.  Outside was just as impressive as my folks made it out to be. Tables and chairs expand in every direction under lights, enclosed by foliage and enough atmosphere to make you question if you are still in Arizona. On appearances alone, Monarch impresses.  But on quality of food and service? Monarch exceeds any and all expectations, doing its own thing and doing it phenomenally. Absolutely every person who came to our table was professional, cordial and quick with the refills. And on that note, I would like to give a sincere round of applause to the bartenders here - the cocktails here are practically works of art, capable of leaving you emotionally stimulated and inspired for any number of activities, whether that's ordering a third round or singing along with the jazzy soundtrack they have piped in throughout the place.  Food is on a whole other level. It was last Friday we were here and I've forgotten practically everything I ate; however, even in the absence of culinary memories, I can safely say everything here is going to knock your socks off. The crab cakes were delicious, the pork belly and salad both raced into my mouth as quickly as I could move my fork, the pork chop was (no joke) the best I have ever had, and I seem to recall the dessert was good, even though at that point I was in a food coma, having an out of body experience and trying to photobomb the table next to us.  If there is one nitpick to have with Cafe Monarch, it's the bathroom. The bathroom itself is gorgeous, probably the nicest one I have ever been in. Plus, there's a random chair in there for... I'm not sure what. But the problem is there's only one bathroom. Unless there is another one somewhere that no one told the six-deep line of us about. It's a very, very minor thing to make note of, but if you are sitting there at your table between courses four and five and you know you're going to need to excuse yourself, you may want to give yourself more time than you think.  But again, that's a minor observation that comes with the territory of an old family home, and certainly nothing to get worked up about. The fact of the matter is Cafe Monarch is definitely in the top 10 dining experiences I have had. The staff is outstanding, the food is impossibly delicious and the entire visit was one that you could not get anywhere else. Don't take my review for it, though: hop on OpenTable and book your table, and then eat a light lunch that day. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "I made reservations to Cafe Monarch for a surprise night out for my boyfriend's birthday. Let me just start, if you are wanting to celebrate any special occasion, this is the perfect place! The restaurant is gorgeous with a romantic setting. The bar had an impressive selection of cocktails, scotch, whiskey, tequila, vodka, sparkling, any wine you could possibly think of, and much more. Our reservations were made for 7 but our table wasn't ready so we made our way to the bar.  Bartender suggested the Like a Stone cocktail for my sweet side and boyfriend got the Bella Sera. My only complaint would be the bar is a little small and there's a lot of traffic for the tight area. The hostess was very apologetic because our table took around 40 minutes to be ready. They comped our cocktails for the wait which was appreciated because they're a little pricey but definitely worth it.  I requested a table outside because I've heard about how beautiful the courtyard is. But of course is was stormy, cold and windy that night. So, it was nice that the hostess seated us inside. Our server, Sam, was very charming and extremely knowledgeable on the menu and wine. We decided to get a bottle of 2016 Malbec from Argentina. It was great but way to much for just us two. But hey, special occasions call for bottles right?  The four courses were divine. My boyfriend and I ordered opposite so we could have a try of everything. When it came to the entree, I ordered the seafood risotto because Sam promised he'd tell me how to make it. He never did so next time he owes me. Haha. My love ordered the surf and turf which he really enjoyed. Food like this is worth every penny. Everything was cooking to perfection and the flavors were sophisticated and blended well. It was a tastebud party all night long.  There was another server named Andrew who was extraordinary and attentive. My boyfriend was pouring us more wine and he came up and asked if he could do it saying \"you're here tonight to relax and let us serve you!\" We felt so special and cared for the entire night. Best service I've had in a long time.  We ended the night with a surprise desert and sparkler that Andrew brought out for my boyfriend. It was a lovely touch. My only regret from the night was not being able to drink the delicious wine that Sam had specially picked out for my risotto. It was spectacular and complimented my meal perfectly. But I was already at my limit and unfortunately couldn't finish it. So, that's a personal apology to Sam and the wine...  Thank you Cafe Monarch for an unforgettable evening. We will definitely be returning again soon and recommending this to all our family and friends.",

    "text": "In a world full of overpriced, ultra hip, high-attitude and low-quality Scottsdale restaurants, it was refreshing to find this amazing gem, Cafe Monarch.  A place where time slows down, and where great service is not an endangered species.  This place is truly amazing, from the ambiance of dinning room, to the romantic patio heated by the gentle glow of central fireplace.    Our waiter, Chris, restored my faith in good service.  Over the years, I have given up on even expecting good service from a waiter at a restaurant.  The plethora of chain restaurants staffed by mechanical robots who repeat pre-prepared lines that someone in corporate marketing written down for them has lowered my expectation for service everywhere.  Chris, however, was a breath of fresh air.  A waiter who actually \"CARED\" about our dining experience, and made sensible recommendations on food and wine to ensure that we got the most out of evening.  Furthermore, he went out of his way to accommodate any request we had even though the place was packed on a Saturday night.  Most important, he had passion for what he was doing, and it showed.    The menu was fantastic, even though it is a set menu that includes four courses, it has enough flexibility and choice to accommodate almost any taste.   The wine list was extensive and extremely well-balanced in terms of selection and price.    Well Done Cafe Monarch!  You have brought all the right elements together to create a new standard in Scottsdale.    Dining Experience Perfection!",

Our waiter was amazing and was supported by the entire team so we never had to wait or wonder where our next course or drink was.  Building, inside and out, is beautiful too.  Easy to understand why they get so many awards.  If you want an outstanding experience, this is the place!",

The descriptions on the menu sounded amazing but what was served was the embodiment of culinary perfection. The service from the valet to the server and manager was impeccable. Andrew was our server and he thoughtfully provided mocktails for me since I was pregnant during our meal. His knowledge of the menu was impressive and his attention to detail was unparalleled. If I could give more than five stars on this review I would! It is a shame we came from out of town and will not be back in for a while.",

We weren't sure of which wine for each course so they allowed us to taste 5 different wines! The dessert was FIRE!   Special shout out to Noah and Michael - these two gents are class acts.

There were no fewer than five people sharing duties to entertain us with our meal last night. Everyone was superb and their spirits were high. The cocktails were perfect. The food was superb. The ambience was fabulous.  For me, this is a special occasion restaurant. You can't be faint of wallet when going here.  The prices are high, but here you get what you pay for.  They are also extremely accommodating. My wife and I split meals, with me getting about 2/3 of it. That was fine with them and we enjoyed the four course dinner between the two of us.  Since the menu changes constantly, I won't get into the details of every course. Except to say that each course was magnificent! The flavors were just outstanding!  If you haven't been, go! If you haven't been since they moved, go back!",

First, service is outstanding, however from our car in the rain you would have thought they would have greeted us with umbrella as I saw across the street. Greeted at the door and waiter was the best of our experience, from explaining the food and ingredients, details about the wines, he made our night, otherwise it would just had been a wasted night. Food was good, however since outside it was so cold, once we started eating it really wasn't very warm anymore. The experience was the waiter and wait staff, fantastic training. The food, well, good but not much different as other top rated restaurants in the area, especially for the price.",

From the moment we walked in, every employee we came into contact with wished us a happy anniversary. Per my wife's request, they sat us in a corner out on the patio, which is a very beautiful and romantic setting.   Our server was great. We ordered a bottle of wine and he asked if we'd like to just sit and enjoy it before we ordered our food. As we were going through the ordering process, the wife was having a hard time deciding between two dishes (standard issue :-)). Anyway, she chose one and when the entrees were delivered, they had taken it upon themselves to serve us an extra entree so the wife could have some of both.   At the end of the meal, they served a special dessert and actually gave my wife a small, yet nice present (not something you just chuck in the trash).  The food was excellent. The service was superb. The atmosphere couldn't have been much better. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that my wine choice didn't hold a candle to the food, but that's my own fault.  Cannot recommend this place highly enough.",

It is a set seasonal menu, every dish is crafted with care and balance. Make sure to reserve a table in advance. The outdoor seating is in a magical little backyard tucked in the back of the restaurant more quiet and romantic if you are trying to woo someone.  Taking off one star because the quality of the service has not been consistent which for a restaurant of this standing (and price) is not acceptable. The service is really the only thing that sometimes make me think twice about going back, I just don't enjoy being snubbed. The cocktails are also quite exquisite, the work of a \"mixologist\".

This restaurant is Magnificent in every way!   The presentation of the food is exquisite.  Beautiful Gastronomic Art on a plate!   Flavors are delicious and complex.    Our server Bradley was extremely good & beyond accommodating.  He proudly described the food & made great recommendations.  Bradley told us about the owner... This he explained is the owner's first restaurant.  He told us how Gus & his family had thought about and planned out every detail.   The venue itself is in a way almost a throwback to another time... It is exquisite in every detail.  Very romantic, private and filled with a beautiful energy... So intimate and magical... it feels like a warm embrace!  What a delight to enjoy this special, charming jewel of a restaurant.   They offer a very reasonably priced 4 course prix fixe with a vegetarian option. We found a lovely wine for $58. Cain & Fable 373. For the price this wine is a great choice.   Our first course was a lovely soup. Cauliflower. It does have a crumbled bacon topping if you are you are vegetarian.  The soup was smooth & had several different flavors, which left us both wanting more. It was served very hot which my husband loves.  I like it a little cooler, so it was perfect for both of us as I allowed it to cool on the spoon.    Second course we selected the prawn. Tempura with a beautiful presentation. Laying on a bed of something vegetable, again exquisite pairing of ingredients... Delicious!   Third course was THE SALAD.  Colorful, Beautifully placed on the plate... A taste blast of  two colors of roasted & then chilled beets, pomegranate, jicama, crisp lettuces.  Salad Perfection!    Fourth course Filet Mignon.  Cooked and seasoned to Absolute perfection. It is a nice large portion with a square of an au gratin potato. This PRIME PRIME PRIME filet melts in your mouth.    The Add On... Foie Gras.  Hudson Valley. Sweet, crispy, PERFECT.  The Best we have ever tasted.  Seriously Spectacular.   Somewhere along the line our server Bradley brought out a scallop side dish for us to taste.  Perfectly cooked, crisp, flavorful. Gordon Ramsey would give it a 100 score.    As it was my husband's birthday.  The chef sent out a complimentary sparkler topped dessert.  Amazing Chocolate Flowerless Cake with Vanilla Bean Gelato.  We both loved it.   To make the night even more delightful Gus, the Chef & Owner, came out & wished my wonder-guy happy birthday.  He was warm, charming, unpretentious, everything his restaurant is. He is a delightful person and an out of this world talented chef.   Call for a reservation... Hope you can get in!  I predict Cafe Monarch will be a Michelin 3 Star ... Top Award Winner very soon!!!   Yelp needs to add an extra star!  It is not even fair to expect great restaurants to compete with Cafe Monarch.  It is Once In A Lifetime Fabulous!",

The atmosphere is super romantic and chill.  Candles lit everywhere and a sweet courtyard.    Back to the amazing food.  It is a chef pre fixe 4 course menu.  And you get to pick the 4th.  The menu changes weekly so you probably won't get what I had.  When I went the first course was a butternut squash soup that was delicious.  It had a great flavor and toasted pumpkin seeds.  2nd course: Lobster cake.  I could have eaten 3 more of them.  Fresh, with a slightly spicy aioli.  Loved it.  3rd course: Caesar salad.  Basically a big piece of romaine lettuce with sauce, a crunchy slice of fried parmeasan cheese, and a piece of candied bacon.  YUM!!  4th course: Citrus Crusted Chilean Sea Bass.  Unbelievable flavor.  Fresh, moist, bright flavors.    I also had some of my wife's filet mignon.  It was covered in a brown sauce and mushrooms and cooked to perfection.  The steak melted in your mouth.  For dessert we had a butter rum cake that was divine and a cappuccino.  The service was also on point.  I doubled the tip it was so excellent.  I have no idea why it is listed as $$$.  The courses start at $65 per person and that doesn't include drinks or a tip.  This is definitely a $$$$ spot.  Whoever is listing it as 3 is trippin.   I highly recommend this place for a special occasion or any serious foodie to check out.",

    "text": "I wavered between a 4 or 5 star and finally ended up at 5. Not only was our meal delicious but the atmosphere is incredible and the whole dinner was memorable. Having come from a small town in the Midwest, I didn't grow up with places or patio's like this (especially not ones you can sit on in January or February) and every time I stumble across one in Phoenix, I act like a kid in a candy store and take 20 pictures of everything and just get HAPPY. The ambiance of the patio was something out of a dream to me. Lots of greenery and vines, pieces of neat decor, and LOTs of candles.   My fiance and I came here with another couple for her birthday dinner and I was so happy that Cafe Monarch was where she chose to go! We had discussed Different Point of View or Elements at Sanctuary but ended up here as it was closer to our after dinner plans at Mabel's on Main. While this place might seem better suited for a romantic dinner for two, it also worked pleasantly well for a table of four. It has been bookmarked on my Yelp forever and it seemed like the type of place that warrants a special night out.   I had been a bit hesitant about the menu since its a limited offering every night but we had the perfect meal when we were told a beef tenderloin filet was offered that night. My FAVORITE! The other meal was scallops. Our waiter was attentive and kept us good on drinks the whole evening. The time between courses was slow but I think they intentionally do that to make the dinner an event rather than trying to turn over the tables quickly. Since we had plans for after dinner, we asked if they could pick up the pace and they definitely did, so the effort was really appreciated.   The filet had a coffee rub on it and a nice sauce over the steak that I enjoyed a lot. So many times you go to Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris and the like and get a big steak but not a lot of other flavors or seasonings on it. While some may say that's the way a steak should be served, sometimes it's nice to switch it up. The filet was 8oz and was very tender and cooked perfectly and I thought the sauce complimented it very well. The salad and dessert were both good too and I would jump at the chance to come back here again. It may even be at the top of my list when my parents visit in April. Definitely has the WOW experience for me!",

I began with the best gazpacho I've ever had, a yellow heirloom tomato and cucumber concoction, followed by watermelon and arugula salad, soft shell crap with spicy papaya and a main course of beet gnocchi and seared scallops. My husband had salmon carpaccio for his first course and filet minion for his 4th. We were both very impressed by the intense and dynamic flavors of each dish and the perfection of the proteins. And because it was our anniversary they even surprised us with a gift and delicious chocolate cake dessert. My husband got the four course wine pairing and our somlier was very friendly and impressive with each serving. If great food and service isn't enough the ambience and atmosphere is very unique and gives you a feeling of a very special occasion.",

    "text": "What a wonderful experience for me.  I had planned all winter to visit this resto.  My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar/Apr this year.  With it being the high season here in AZ, we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night.  So, we booked our date.  A week out, my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it.  Well, I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell wasn't going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go.    Ok, so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner.  NO WAY.  This place has the most romantic, quiet and beautiful patio dining room.  With it being April, the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks ... ME.. solo.  Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone.. Nope... table for 1.  I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself.  Every person that came to my table called me by name, Ms D, can I get you some more Tea?  Ms D, how was the this and Ms D, can we get you a that?  Oh man, all that fuss over me made me feel like a True princess.  Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway.  I was too.  My meal was very good.  A week or so before the dinner, Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we didn't like and what we liked.  I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish.  I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES.  How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me!    So its the dinner night....   On my drive to dinner, I remember thinking to myself, how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds.  I thought, what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish?  I shrugged it off and thought, \"naaaah\".  Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa!) with, you guessed it, blanched fennel and etc.  My heart sank because I don't really eat beef, which was the other option.  so, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish.    To my surprise, the fish comes out and, you guessed it, I LOVED it.  Fennel and all.  I was shocked.  I ate EVERY bite of that fish.  Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right.  It was actually extremely pleasant.    Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars.  They get a bonus star for the stellar service.  I think I will return for a b'day dinner... alone in the next couple of weeks.  I'm due for some food pampering.    Bravo Chef Chris and staff!",

When we got their the first thing they told us was happy anniversary and told us they saved us the most romantic table in the restaurant.  We were lead back to a quiet table in the back corner of the patio tucked away from everyone. There was a personal heater right next to me, candles surrounding us and quiet music. I can honestly say it was the most romantic place we have ever eaten. The food was great- although the ambiance of the restaurant outdid the food! My husband LOVED the filet minion and left me wishing I got that instead of my chicken breast. My husband and I tried scallops for the first time and took one small bite each and knew they just weren't for us. The server took notice and took them off our bill completely!  They also brought us a small gift for our anniversary and a complementary AMAZING dessert.  For our anniversary, they truly blew our socks off- I will recommend this place to EVERYONE. This did not disappoint!!",

    "text": "\"A Most Romantic Dinner in Old Scottsdale\"  Cafe Monarch should drop the \"Cafe\" because it takes away from the sheer elegance, and romantic setting of this fantastic restaurant. The magical atmosphere was reminiscent of Le Vallauris in Palm Springs.  We went with our good friends from Chicago, and asked to be seated in their Courtyard, which is definitely the place to be. With tiny lights, it transforms the Monarch like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.   The drinks are creative. They have a four course prix fixe menu. The roasted cauliflower soup was superb with nice touches of smoked pine nuts, garlic confit, beet chips and white truffle oil creme fraiche. The spring salad was loaded with surprises including smoked goat cheese, roasted brussel sprouts and beets, pickled yellow beets, cashews, and a chile garlic vinaigrette. This was followed by an ahi tuna poke or a vegetarian pasta offering.   There were four main courses to choose from including a macadamia crusted halibut, filet mignon, crispy skin chicken breast or polenta lasagna. We had the halibut and filet which were nicely prepared.  They gave my wife a beautiful complimentary dessert with a nice keepsake. Our server Sam was attentive and knowledgable.  We all agreed Monarch was our favorite restaurant on our trip to Scottsdale.",

For the price of the food with respect to the quality, it is also a great value. The staff is also very, very friendly and very attentive to ensuring you are having a great experience.",

Gorgeous outdoor seating surrounded by vegetation and candlelight. A beautiful romantic oasis. Definitely worth the money and visit. Wonderfully professional, attentive, and welcoming staff.

The best part of lunch was the tomato soup with mini grilled cheese bite.  Based off the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the surf & turf tacos. These tacos were something a preschooler could throw together. Save yourself from disappointment and order the roasted beef tips...SOOO good! I had major food envy, but it is my own fault for listening to someone else's recommendation. Seriously, I don't understand why those tacos are even on the menu. Maybe our waiter forgot to put in our order and they had to throw it together in 3 seconds? I don't know but for such great reviews I left hungry and mad.

The food was phenomenal, of course, but so were all the cocktails and dessert. One of the best things about the family-owned restaurant though is it's able to evoke a sense of timelessness that allows you to come in, sit down and just take your time with everything--the person you're with, the dishes you're about to enjoy, and really be present in the moment. It's a little desert oasis that's been curated to perfection.",

    "text": "My Husband and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner at Cafe Monarch recently to celebrate my Birthday.  This gem is tucked away on a street in Old Town Scottsdale and is so cute and inviting from the moment you pull up to the parking lot.  Upon our arrival we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Given it was over 100 degrees outside we were taken aback, but reassured that the outside patio was very cool (thanks to misters) and quite nice.  I'm so glad we did because it is so cute, romantic, and peaceful out on the patio, just the right setting for this lovely dinner.  As many of said, the menu is pre-fixed and includes 4 courses.  When we went, I was so happy the everything on the menu looked good and met my taste.  We had some kind of bruchetta for appetizer, which was awesome.  It was a touch salty, but that did bring out the flavors of everything else.  The salad course was good as well... could have done without the frisee lettuce (personal preference), but LOVED the beets.  For our entree we both opted for the filet.  The sauce was to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Again, the salt was very aggressive, but everything else was so tasty, we were able to overlook that.  For dessert we had a chocolate cake concoction that was quite good.  Cafe Monarch is a unique restaurant and a must for any foodie.  The time and attention given at this restaurant is match by few others.  They even gave me a beautiful candle for my Birthday!  Can't wait to give Cafe Monarch another try for a special occasion in the future.",

    "text": "The hype is well deserved.  This really was as close to a perfect dining experience as I've had in awhile.  Sure its pricey, but I knew that going in and the experience was completely worth it.  I actually took my Mom here for dinner on a brutally hot summer evening.  She originally wanted to go somewhere else fancy but after reading up on this place on Yelp and seeing the Check Please AZ segment, I steered her in this direction.  Boy am I glad that I did.  This place is set in an otherwise nondescript part of Downtown Scottsdale near the southwest corner of Goldwater and Indian School.  When you drive up to the premises, you see a long but narrow building and the hostess waiting right at the front door.  I got a little confused about where to go as they no longer have the dining room in the kitchen area, but rather on the north side of the building.  The setup of the interior is just as other Yelpers have described.  Beautiful, quaint, intimate.  There's a beautiful courtyard in back with dining tables as well but it was far too hot to dine outside tonight.  No worries though, we had a great view of the outside from our table.  The biggest surprise to me was actually how casual the dress was.  The men I saw were all in polos and khakis while the women were in casual summer dresses.  Not nearly as dressy as I expected.    The menu here changes weekly and there are very few choices you get to make.  Its a four course menu with an amuse bouche (basically a light snack) to start, then an appetizer, then you choose between one of three entrees, and then a dessert.  The amuse bouche tonight was a grilled zucchini soup with goat cheese and a crostini.  Fantastic start to the meal as the soup was cold, light, and the crostini was incredibly flavorful despite its relatively small size.  Dipping it in the soup was the best part.  The appetizer was a romaine salad with a smoked tomato dressing and various shaved veggies including carrots, radish and beets, topped off with some feta.  You definitely pick up the smoky flavor of the dressing, but the feta smooths it out and the salad portion was actually very generous.  Then came the main course.  I chose the ribeye with beef jus, corn puree, and baby spinach.  My Mom went with the crab cakes with eggplant and tomato.  Not to brag, but my dish was the best.  The ribeye meat was so tender I could've cut it with a spoon.  The puree and jus were a perfect topping to a steak that literally tasted like butter in my mouth.  I had some of my Mom's crab cake too and it was very good, though even she agreed my ribeye dish was superior.  In addition to the main course, there was an add-on we chose to share.  It was a Vietnamese-style shrimp with green papaya.  We each had two pieces.  The spicyness of it caught us both by surprise, but not so spicy that it took away from the flavor or the enjoyment.  Finally for dessert we each got a Coconut Tres Leches cake with blackberries and a lime chocolate sauce.  Super moist cake and the sauce was excellent.  The coconut might've been a little watery, but otherwise a great way to cap off an epic meal.  For drinks we did the wine pairing with the dinner.  We got a white wine for our first two courses, and a red for the last two.  I especially loved the Pinot Noir that we got with the main entree.  Smooth, rich, and paired perfectly with the ribeye.  In addition, I checked in on Yelp and that allowed my Mom to get a free glass of house wine to help her cap things off.   Alright, the price.  Like I said, not cheap.  We're talking special occasion only.  Total for two four course meals (plus wine pairings), plus the shrimp add-on, tax, and tip was about $250.  My Mom was nice enough to split the bill with me on this go-round.  And in all fairness, we went all out.  If you come here and just get the four course dinner, water, and no add-ons, you'll probably pay closer to $70/person.  That said, the add-on dish and wine pairings were totally worth it in my opinion.  Made the experience that much better.  The staff is extremely friendly, accommodating, and professional and were very knowledgable about every product we were served right down to the vintage of the wines.  Here's another fun fact about this place.  They have the nicest restroom I've ever seen.  Seriously.  Ever.  Its immaculate and exquisitely decorated.  Nicer than any restroom at anyone's house I've been to.  My Mom even said as much.  It would be hard to compare this place to Binkley's because its apples vs oranges.  But the quality of the food, first class service, and quasi-casual feel of Cafe Monarch is certainly comparable with Binkley's.  It's mainly just a difference in style and presentation.  But as I write this, Cafe Monarch is by far the best restaurant experience I've had in Scottsdale to date.",

    "text": "It has been several weeks since our trip to Phoenix and I thought it was finally time to write a review of Cafe Monarch. Chef Chris, sorry it took so long but I have been slammed at work which is typically where I do my best Yelping :)  Cafe Monarch is one of the most unique, and delicious, dining experiences we have ever partaken. We lived in Phoenix for many years and Cafe Monarch was on the top of our list to try before moving to Dallas. Sadly, we discovered that the restaurant is closed in the summer time and we missed our window of opportunity before leaving for the Big D. As we planned our trip back to the Valley of the Sun for this past March, we knew which restaurant topped our list of \"Must Haves\" while on vacation.  Upon our arrival to the restaurant, Chef Chris greeted us from behind the cooking station. He notified us that our table was out on the patio and that he had the special menu requests of the other two members of our party. The staff that night notified us of that night's menu, for both the carnivores and pescatarians of the group, and was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We made our menu selections for the evening which included an appetizer of prosciutto and pesto on a toasted baguette with a salad of fennel and green apples, a main course of roasted pork loin and black rice topped with a sweet chili sauce, and a homemade angel food cake with fresh fruit. Everything was superb. The fennel and apple salad was very unique and the pork was cooked perfectly (I hate dried out pork).  What was most interesting about this experience is that Chef Chris takes the time to speak with his guests. Dining at Cafe Monarch is more like eating a meal at someones home rather than going to a restaurant. Chef Chris is an artist and a remarkable host. He wants each guest to leave feeling satisfied with not only the meal but the overall experience. We talked about everything from food, to running a small business, to Yelp. Chris cares about the opinion people have of Cafe Monarch and goes to great lengths to be sure people have a great experience. He even showed us the new dining room which should be opening soon.  The price of the meal was what you would expect form a fine dining experience. Actually, it is pretty reasonable for 5 stars especially since it is BYOB.  Cafe Monarch was worth the wait. I wish we had something similar in Dallas but we will just have to make Cafe Monarch a special treat whenever we are back in Phoenix.  Thank you for a fantastic evening!",

    "text": "An interesting, almost unique experience, dinner at Cafe Monarch is much like that in a small Spanish or Mediterranean cafe.  There are 17 seats, one chef, one waiter, and a fixed menu (you get your choice of three entrees however).  If you have special dietary requirements, tell the chef when you make your absolutely necessary reservations a month in advance.  The experience earns the four stars, but the food is not good enough to propel Cafe Monarch beyond that.  Not that it's bad -- but there are too many rough edges and not quites, such as the superfluous undercooked potatoes in the London Broil salad.  Service is slow -- three courses in two hours -- but you won't mind since you can watch the chef cooking from most tables and it is an exceptionally comfortable place to eat.  Definitely bring your own wine, expect to experience new tastes, ignore the minor eccentricities, and you will be glad you came.",

We were taken to the kitchen to meet the chef before we were seated outside in the courtyard.  It was lovely.  We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed the appetizer: fresh mushrooms, asparagus, roasted bell peppers, proscuitto and pesto with lavash crackers.  It was a generous portion and both my mother and I felt like we could have walked away after the appetizer satisfied!  The two entrees were absolutely fantastic.  Pork with cheddar polenta and some sort of (delicious) new mexico chile sauce.  Scallops fried in panko with arugula and heirloom tomatoes.  We tried both and were very satisfied.  Again, the portion was quite healthy and we felt totally satisfied.  Dessert was good.  Fresh berried, mango with vanilla ice cream and fried wontons with chocolate sauce and berry sauce.    Service was terrific.  We had a great time and wish we could go back tonight!  If we lived in AZ, we would come back on a weekly basis!",

Chef Chris is to be congratulated for this, as I have found at other restaurants  commenting on the food was  meet with open hostility.  Chef Christopher kindly offered me a \"refund\" which was not the intent of my review, but it is greatly appreciated in the spirit of exceptional customer service, for which he is known.

If however, you enjoy unique dining experiences and spending time talking with your dining companions then this is the place for you.  Yes, it's BYOB and cash only.  The fact that it's cash only, who cares.  Really?  Why people find an issue in that is ridiculous.  You know in advance so why can't you plan for it?  And me personally, I love the fact that I can bring a really great bottle of wine versus ordering the same bottle at a restaurant marked up 200+%.  A $10 corkage fee is very minimal.  Now let me get to the food.  $45 for a pre-fixed 3 course meal is PEANUTS for the amount and quality of food you receive.  Chef Chris takes great pride in his unique creations and I love showing up and being surprised.  While his creatiions are unique, they are not crazy adventurous where most people couldn't be satisfied at the entree selections.  He does create highly complex dishes with interesting flavor profiles that will leave you guessing how he imagined such unique combinations.  And yes, as some previous posts noted, there is a time delay in receiving your courses.  Again, this is an experience, not a meal at the Olive Garden. Chef Chris preps and creates every bit of your meal as a one-man show with fresh ingredients that change daily with the season.  Why rush it, enjoy it, it's worth it!  And really, some are upset if he doesn't make it to their table?  He's cooking all the food for everyone by himself.  On nights where he can pop out and mingle with his guests, he does.  Other nights it may not be as feasible.  Give him a break.  Ignore the negative posts and go give Chris a chance for yourself.  It's these small restaurants with amazing food that I choose to give my money to and support.  You should too.  If you have the right attitude and love great food, you will not be disappointed.",

For a business owner who cares about every customer's opinion, there's no batter business man he can be!",
