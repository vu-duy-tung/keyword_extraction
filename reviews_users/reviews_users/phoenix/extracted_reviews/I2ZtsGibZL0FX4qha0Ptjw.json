    "text": "Wouldn't normally give a fast food burger place 5 stars.  Here is why I gave Smashburger the honor:  1.  When we arrived all the tables were full.  A couple exited a table right as we finished getting our drinks.  We swooped on it.  Even though we began cleaning the table ourselves, a staff member STILL came, wiped it off with a rag, and gave us a smile.  2.  The food was DELICIOUS!  My chicken sandwich was hot, fresh, and had great toppings.  The bun was even good!  DH loved his 1/3 lb Smashburger and devoured it in less than 5 minutes.  3.  When we were leaving, even though we attempted to bus our own table, yet ANOTHER friendly staffperson came by and grabbed our stuff for us.  An inexpensive meal with a positive and friendly staff... and food that was worth eating again and again.    Way to go Smashburger!!!!",

    "text": "I had Smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. My burger was way too greasy. The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.  They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish.",

I dislike the fact that they are super greasy, and sometimes seem to fall apart, but that's hit or miss.. More often then not, lately they've seemed undercooked and falling apart... The ones that aren't falling apart are good, and a lot less messy.. The grease is always there.. The fries are nothing to write home about, smash fries or otherwise... I go here occasionally when I had a hankering for a particular burger off what I call the \"old secret menu\" which is called a sin city smash burger (the used to serve it there a long time ago, and still do in vegas, I gather every state has there own special smash burger)... Sin city smash is the best bang for your buck in my opinion.. I never went for a shake there because the heartache is already steep ebough from laying 8-9$ for a burger.. Def not a bad place, just way too expensive, too crowded, and sometimes inconsistent.. I think other compsrable places like five guys is way more consistant, and gracious with the amount of fries you give and choices for free toppings. idk, just my opinion tho.",

I've eaten at several around the valley and they have all been consistent with each other in food quality and kind service. The food is always fresh, the fries always done to perfections (sweet potato & regular). I'm definitely hook.  I take my teen boys wherever they want to go for their birthday dinner and this is usually their choice. I don't complain because it's so inexpensive compared to the places they use to request before Smashburger opened.",

    "text": "Burgers in my mind are supposed to be grilled over a flame, thick and medium rare. Served with a toasted bun, american cheese with let/tom/pic/mayo and mustard. (It's my review)  SB does most of it perfectly.   The Bun is a yellow egg bun, toasted and topped with all the required toppings.   The toppings were all fresh and very good, including the cheese.   The burger, while it is a 1/2 l/b about 1/3 was lapping over the bun. It is a thin, flat fried burger, sort of crispy on one side too. While not my preferred, it was still a good tasting burger. Just not great.   IMHO Five guys is better if fried burgers are your thing.   The staff was great. The management was great, the place was pretty clean the price was high for what I recieved. $6 burger $1.80 drink.   (it was plenty of food though)  3.86 stars",

Finally at the 5 minute mark she finally helped us and I asked her if we were invisible. To which she said \"sorry if i.don't get baskets back there they have nothing to put food on. \" I told her either way it was rude. She took our order and I asked for the manager. Other customers behind us were saying she was rude too. Talked to the manager to which he replied its her first week. I said no excuse its rude. He agreed and gave us half off however theres no room for bad customer service. Would have been 5 stars but I hate bad customer service.",

I have to say the guac isn't the best but it does it's job with so much going on. The hubs is all over the create his own which almost always has a fried egg on it (if you haven't tried it this way you should). The kiddo loves the BBQ Bacon & Cheddar & at 13 with a real metabolism I say go kid go!Then the sides.... oh the sides! Deep fried pickle slices are my personal fave. A close second is the Smash Fries which are seasoned with rosemary, olive oil & garlic. Mmm mmm good! Then last but not least are the sweet potato smash fries also seasoned with rosemary, olive oil & garlic too. Enjoy by all means enjoy God & my skinny jeans know I do.",

So I went with a chipotle bun, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, jalapenos 1/3 burger!! It was devine, juicy, spicy and lovely :) Although I wasn't fond of the haystack onion rings...a bit soggy :( My dad got the Arizona Smashburger which made him sweat from the spicy habanero cheese and jalapeno combination.  Sweat is always a good sign with my dad!! As for the dining ambiance, we got it to go but while I waited in the restaurant I was impressed with how clean the dining area was and the staff was friendly.   Overall, I was impressed with Smashburger and would recommend their burger any day :)",

I was eager to try it out when we found one.   We both ordered the Classic SmashBurger (the bigger size -  1/2 lb patty, $5.99) which came with American cheese (I'd go with cheddar next time - I didn't notice it came with American when I ordered it), lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion (we got grilled instead of raw), pickles and smash sauce. We also each got a side of SmashFries which were thin-cut fries, covered in garlic, olive oil and rosemary. The burgers were greasy (I like that) and very good! They tasted beefy and fresh, exactly how a good burger should be. The fries were a nice change from normal fries and tasted great. If we were in the area, or close to another location, we'd definitely stop by again. I'd like to try to Arizona SmashBurger next time - it sounded amazing!   The service was fast, attentive and friendly.   The only star-docking drawback was the price. I think that the burger price should include fries.",

My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.  we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.  first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing.   on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but i'll give it another try one day.",

We went there before Blu Sol Massage and Spa since it was nearby, but my husband assured me that it was incredible (he goes to one near his work in Tempe sometimes.)   We ordered, the employees were nice, the food came out pretty quickly, and they have sweet potato fries! I usually hate hamburgers, but I actually enjoyed the Smashburger I had. I can't even remember what I ordered though, other than the delicious sweet potato fries :P  Oh, they also have bottled root beer there too. I'm not sure if that's common knowledge, but I thought it was pretty cool :)  Overall, great service, great food, and it was a pretty stress-free lunch.

    "text": "I am not sure who writes all these good reviews for this place.  All I can say is \"Yuck.\"  $23 dollars for a BBQ Bacon burger, an Avocado burger, an order of fries, and an onion haystack, and 2 small drinks.    Whoever thought the idea of taking a small piece of what could have started out as a nice piece of meat and smashing all the juice out of it then cooking it until it was almost unrecognizable as beef would be a good idea?  We dined in at about 1:00 PM today, a Tuesday.  There were 2 dirty tables available when we arrived.  When I started cleaning one so we could sit, the girl came up to me and said, \"I will do that for you\" then took the towel out of my hand and walked away to deliver some food to another table.  She came back fairly quickly and did a marginal job cleaning the table by wiping most of the crumbs into her hand and onto the seat.    My burger was charred on the outside and actually almost as dark brown on the inside as it was on the outside.  If there was bbq sauce on it, there was so little that it was quickly absorbed by the cardboard burger and had very little flavor.  The onion haystack was a small pile of greasy cold onion flavored breading.  The entire $2.29 order of onions was piled in a mound just larger than the total volume of the beef in the burger.  Because the beef was soooooo overcooked, it was not a large piece of meat.  The fries were not much better.  Again, cold and greasy and a very small order, although not as small as the haystack.  My Girlfriend, who likes her beef cooked more well done than I do, also complained that the food was extremely low quality for the price and that we would have been better off ordering from the dollar menu of one of our local burger joints.  Knowing how much we hate those places, that was quite a condemnation on the quality of the food.  I ate about 1/3 of my burger before deciding I couldn't stomach any more of it and she ate just over half of hers.  Then we decided to go across the street to Costco and get a hot dog.",

    "text": "While I generally love this place, my visit today was less than stellar. When I arrived, the restaurant was steady, but not packed. In line there was one person ahead of me, no one behind me. Waiting for to-go orders were 2 small groups (one couple, getting 2 burgers and fries and mom and 3 kids, just getting shakes). The reason I bring this up is that it took a small eternity to get my order.  My first sign of trouble was the mother and her children getting their shakes. The comment I should have queued on was, \"Now kids, are your shakes worth the long wait?\" I brushed that off...they're shakes, they take a while to make 3. My next sign of trouble was a guy holding onto his burger and walking to the counter. Apparently he had ordered a Swiss and mushroom burger, and unfortunately for him, they forgot the mushrooms?? I saw the counter girl speak to the cook and they both seemed to get a laugh out of it. When my order was finally ready, I didn't check it. The only thing I changed was asking for no cheese on the BBQ, bacon, and cheddar burger. When I got home (about 10-15) minutes later, I was disappointed to see that literally the only thing on the Burger was BBQ sauce and bacon. The menu isn't complicated, it's not cheap, and I go there for quality. On top of the burger flop, the fries were about 1/3 full....I can live with that, but really? I tried to call the store, but the phone just rang and rang....so disappointed.",

[A representative of the Smashburgers in this area had reached out to me, and sent vouchers, asking me to revisit last month.]  We ordered (and used our vouchers) paid for our reminder (large order, and the milkshakes were irresistible. Hey it's a hot day) and sat down. We had our food within 15 minutes bagged and ready to go. They look to have handled just as many orders today with less personal than last time. The manager was the one ringing everyone up and running the front counter today too.  We just finished eating at home:  Smelled and tasted delicious. We're contemplating going back for another 3 burgers! My friends who are local here swear by Smashburger. I'm hoping the last time was just an isolated event.   Will probably returning in a few weeks through that area and will be definitely considering grabbing a burger to go.",

The past 3 times out order was made wrong, and it took 3 times as long to fix it as it did to bring it out in the first place. Walls are dirty, holes or teared wallpaper on some. Staff ranges from frazzled to aloof to couldn't care less. Today our burgers were brought out (wrong) and was told our fries would be right up. 8 minutes later our fries showed up, still missing out shake. Caramel shake came out with crusty chocolate on the glass. Place had flies and Mosquitos coming in every time the door opened. Burgers had no flavor, only half my bun had sauce. I don't mean like only the top or bottom had sauce, no I mean literally only HALF of the top bun had sauce on it. So I cut my burger in half and only one half was moderately tasty (didn't know they didn't know how to use a spatula until I ate the ok side). Smash fries were pure oil & burnt herbs.  Seriously SmashBurger, you aren't the only quick place in the lot any more, step up or step out. You sell burgers & fries, how can you mess up so much, so often!??!",

The burger is among the best I've had. Big, juicy, full flavored patty resembling a home-made burger. I had it with the sweet onion fries, which were good, but the sweet flavor does not go well with the burger. Go for regular fries instead. Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Was in the area of 99th Ave and McDowell and decided to go to Smash Burger.  I ordered a small classic smash burger add mayo easy onion, a smash burger with no onion, and a single order of fries.  It took them 3 tries to get the sandwiches correct, the result being that I had to put the onion on the burger myself.  The french fries were cold, and the the meal was not something I enjoyed.  As I worked my way through the burger, the patty was smashed thin which made it easy to be overcooked, and it was, and dried out.    I frequent the Smash Burger at I-17 and Happy Valley.  Their Burgers are why I even like Smash Burger to begin with.  I love the burgers there.  I've always gotten nice juicy burgers that make me want to eat the whole thing.  I asked why the difference, and they said they must have different equipment.  As I sat here writing this review, I grew more and more suspicious.  It's BOGO, and the total is feeling like it was too high.  I get a copy of the receipt and sure enough, the BOGO isn't on there.  A certified trainer went and asked the person who took our order about it, and came back to us and said she didn't hear us.  I feel compelled to call this what it was... a lie!  When we placed the order, I told her I had the BOGO offer to which she replied, she knew the code so not to worry.  Why can't they just admit the mistake and apologize for it.  Would have made the experience a little more forgiving.  As it stands, it's a horrible place to eat, the staff can't be trusted, they'll probably make your food wrong, and no matter the offer, GET A RECEIPT! Verify that you were charged correctly.  More and more places are making the issuing of a receipt optional, and they default to no receipt. It's turning out to be a practice best reserved to places you frequently visit, and trust.  All others give me proof.   Not a place it would recommend to friends or strangers. Now the one off I-17 and Happy Valley, they're awesome.  Never a problem in about 13-15 orders. Every one was just as good as the first.",

I had the Arizona burger it had habanero cheese, jalapenos and a spicy sauce.  The burger wasn't as hot as it sounds but pretty tasty.  The meat was mouth watering and the freshness did show.  We shares some smash fries they were ok kind if greasy but not too bad.    Overall I would recommend this as the burger spot on the west side.  If your out and about over here give it a shot.

Perhaps Smash Burger would be as delightful as playing Smash Brothers.  Well after about 4 years I finally resolved to verify the validity of my thesis. I've concluded that although a direct correlation cannot be established, Smash Burger is indeed delightful!  I ordered a \"make your own\" hamburger with chipotle bread. Instead of fries, I ordered veggie frites: asparagus and carrot sauteed in some sort of oil, then lightly sweetened with salt (sea?). The veggie frites did it for me. It was so delicious I made sure to buy extra on my next visit.  Good food. Customer service was excellent. The restaurant was clean. Smash Burger has a new fan.",

I was wrong..  =  /  Maybe I was expecting little too much or perhaps person who was cooking that day was mad at the world and decided to take out his anger on the burger by smashing it!!

Do I must experience that all over again?  I am sure I was one of the hundreds who got the bad burger of the day.. If they had a section of the wall saying, \"Hall of shame burger\" and I would be on it.. Oh boy was it terrible!  But during my second visit.  Burger wasn't too bad, but still didn't satisfied my taste bud.   All I tasted was.. average burger at average burger shop with average price for average service..  Maybe I am not your average guy?

Menu has changed some over the years, but I was super stoked when they moved into Avondale's Foodie Corner at 99th and McDowell.  Service is relatively quick and the people are only par for the course the times I've been into the restaurant. But the food... Oh, my carnivorous happy hoots...   Burgers are super tasty. Not huge, but the flavor, soft bun, and moistness are superb. The salads (yup, they have salads!) are also great to eat, though you can tell they aren't health food by the salt and oil in the flavor mix. Probably the best two things on the menu though are the Smashfries and the shakes. The fries are frite-style, crispy, and have the most wonderful blend of salt, olive oil, garlic and rosemary flavors. The shakes come in many options-- all have the taste of heavy butterfat, and are perfectly thick.   Definitely worth a visit, or eight. :o)",

I like that they made the effort for that.  I felt comfortable.  I ordered the AZ Smashburger.  It comes with habanero chile cheese, chipotle mayo, and jalapenos along with all the standard fixings.  I ordered the Smash fries.  They are drenched in olive oil and are seasoned with rosemary.  To drink, I had a Cherry Coke.  That was a nice surprise at the soda fountain.  My burger was good, not great.  You can choose from a third or half pound burger.  I went with the third.  My fries were wet.  They tasted okay.  I compare rosemary fries with Fez's rosemary fries.  Smashburger's are lacking.  The oil is a bit much and for some reason they were not salty enough.  They were bland wet fries.  I will go back to Smashburger.  I will choose it over Mac Donald's or Burger King.  They are hip and with the times.  They sell beer too.  The staff was young and fresh faced.  They were very upbeat.  They were playing cool music too.  I will be back.  Three stars because after all it is a burger joint.",

This should have been a sign for us. We went in and there were two people in line, one at each register. We proceeded to watch as several different people messed around with the cash registers. After 6 minutes and not a word of explanation from anyone about why we were waiting this long, one of the customers at the register finally had enough and walked out. We decided to follow suit and went to the place a few doors down. When we were leaving with our food, we saw that some of our fellow \"line waiters\" from Smashburger had joined us at the competition. I'll never be back. My distaste for this place may be clouded by the exceptional service that I normally receive at other fast-casual places. This place just seems to be poorly managed. We should have never been left to stand in line without any explanation for 6 minutes. So many companies come from California with a \"you're lucky to be eating here\" attitude. This place falls into that category. They could take a lesson from In and Out.",

The burgers are greasy but they are SO flavorful that the heart attack later on down the road will be worth it. They grill it up just the way you want it with all the toppings you want.

The meal was $19.00 for two burgers, fries and sodas, way too expensive for what you get. The burgers were sooo greasy my wife would not eat hers, the fries are fake potatoes, and the soda machine was broke so we had warm can soday to add to the ice which diluted it very quickly. For half the price we can go to In and Out and get a really good meal without the grease and the noise. We won't be back that is for sure.",

Got our fry order wrong,  did not think I would like the rosemary/olive oil fries,  but got them by mistake tried them an loved them.  If you like your burger hot with all the trimmings you will love this.  1/3 lb. or 1/2 lb. size meat and both are generous.  Tried it for the first time Friday and we will be back,  they are building more so looking for one a little closer eventually in the meantime I will travel. Not a huge eating area but it was constantly busy, some tables outside or takeout of course.  The people were friendly and very helpful stopped by table to see if we were satisfied and when we asked questions about other locations he was happy to advise. Oh did I tell you they were juicy, they were, and very tasty.",

Instead of helping the customer, in one of the many ways they could have and/or opening their second register, every employee on the floor congregated, inconveniencing every customer in the restaurant.  On top of that, they messed her order up anyhow.  No concessions were given for the inconvenience when I asked the cashier. I didn't stomp and pout because there was a long line behind me, and I didn't want to inconvenience them. They want to eat and go their way too.  I've eaten here many times in the past, but never brought my child. The child burger consisted of: bun, no sauces, burger and cheese. - no lettuce, no tomato, no onion, nothing. It's my fault for assuming a $5.59 kids combo would have more. Ketchup and mustard we're available at the table. Ketchup=vegetable I guess. I didn't come to a burger joint to eat healthy, right?  Oh hey.. I finished eating, typed this review...and the lady mentioned above just got her order fixed. I like the food here, but I won't be waiting for my food again with a few really good restaurants next door.",

They then handed me a bag that had been sitting under the heat lamp since I arrived and said sorry. Foul on me, I didn't look through the bag to make sure everything was there - I just trusted the employee who was staring in the bag holding a greasy ticket she had plucked from inside the bag with my order listed on it. I rushed home to feed my starving toddlers only to discover that only half my order was in there but I did get a bonus burger from someone else's order.

We had to wait forever for our food and they got two of the three orders wrong. On mine, there was no fried egg. Okay, easy fix.  But the other one...my friend ordered Smash Tots and got Smash Fries. The staff dropped the basket so fast we had to flag somebody else down to tell them. She had my friend move her burger to a napkin, then took the basket of Smash Fries back to the kitchen. When the Smash Tots come out, we ask what happens to the wrong orders. The staff member baldly says \"Oh, they go out on the next order.\"  So, food has been left at a table. It's then taken back to the kitchen and re-used, colder than fresh made and with who knows what germs are on it after some other customer's sneeze or whatever was on their fingers after they stole a few fries. Can you say health hazard?  Never again, SmashBurger. That's disgusting.",

My salad was tiny...a side salad at best...for $8.90...a scrawny fashion model might call that a meal but no normal human would. Our \"bottled\" drinks for $2.52 were actually fountain drinks.  That would have been reasonable if it was delicious food, but alas, it was barely mediocre. In-N-Out is five times better for half the price.  After spending  $40 for delivery for two people, I'm looking for something else to eat. Smashburgee gets a double thumbs down!!",

    "text": "A Better Burger   Smashburger is a good choice if your looking to  have a casual lunch that is  reasonably priced.   Smashburger offers a variety of burgers from which to choose, including build-your-own options. Smashburger has a variety of unique  side dishes, to compliment your burger.  In addition to the traditional fries offered at most burger places, Smashburger offers sweet potato fries, smashfries tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, haystack onions, deep fried pickles, and veggie frites which are flash-fried carrot sticks, green beans and asparagus.  The service is pleasant, the ingredients are fresh and the food is cooked to order; if you're familiar with either In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys Burgers, the food here is arguably of similar caliber.",

I had the Smashburger fries and they were ok but could have been better.  The are seasoned and have olive oil on them which is ok but there was a bit much for my liking.  The burgers were good and we sat out side which was pretty nice.  We will be returning.    The bill:   Two 1/3 pound burgers, one order of fries and onion rings and two sodas.  $19.00.  They also have a decent selection of bottled beers.  Almost forgot to mention that!",

The place was packed and we almost didn't get a seat before our food was ready. We were instantly hooked on their food. My husband orders their BBQ Burger and I love the Classic Smashburger. The produce used is high quality and actually ripe. No yellow tomatoes here! The pictures you see of the burgers are a very good representation, not just some prop. Their Smash Fries, regular fries and Veggie Frites are yummy.   The cashiers have been a little off each time we've been there, but probably because they are crazy busy. The servers have been super great, always accommodating and friendly. They also keep the place very clean.  As I stated before, the place needs more seating! Last night, we invited about 25 friends with us. (Not kidding!) The place was crowded inside, so we were trying to figure out seating arrangements on the patio. The manager came out to check on us & seemed a little frustrated by our large group, rather than grateful for the business.   My husband tried to order a frosty mug root beer float, but they had run out of their IBC Root Beer. They also told him they ran out of meat earlier in the week because they have been super busy.   I think once they get all the small kinks worked out, it will be even better.",

I placed an online order, immediately after placing the order, received my confirmation that my order would be ready in over 15 minutes. I drove there, and and about 20 minutes after placing my order, my order had not yet been started. I was a bit annoyed after a long day, the point of ordering take-out was for the convenience factor. As I stood there, it took forever to even be acknowledged by the man behind the counter. Once I was acknowledged by someone else, the manager came to me with a very unprofessional demeanor with, \"Hey what's up man?\". As a manager trying to resolve an issue, I would never speak to a customer like that. When I questioned him on my order, never once did he take ownership or offer the very simple apology I was looking for. All he could say was \"there's nothing I can do.\" A simple apology would have been sufficient. As a customer, I took my business elsewhere and will never be going back.",

However I waited 10 mins. just to place my order because the employees were too preoccupied talking and looking at what was going on in the back. (And I was the FIRST person in line.) I finally get my order taken and I wait and wait and wait. About 30 minutes pass and my food still isn't ready. Come to find out they skipped my order when I WAS the FIRST person in line. During my time waiting for my food I heard yelling and staff members yelling inappropriate noises and things coming from the back. When I get my food I order a chicken sandwich; I received a burger. When I ordered I got smash fries; I got regular, hard, stale fries. I waited too long to deal w anything else and left. I was too grossed out to even eat my food. I will no longer go to this location and possibly any other location. They ruined what I think about smash burger. Don't waste your time going here. I would give 0 stars if it was an option.",

We had 1 salted Carmel shake, 1 vanilla shake, 1 garlic smashed tots, a smash single, and a bbq bacon and cheddar burger. First off they didn't add garlic to my tots, the shakes were like a warm glass of milk, and the burgers tasted as if they were reheated in a microwave. Disgusting. Not inedible. Just gross. We were starving so we ate it... but even when your starving things usually taste good and this still did not. It was pricey for what you get even if it did taste good. We won't go back. I'm sorry to say cold Burger King would've been better.",

They also forgot my 2nd order of fries, which I had to remind them about. The fries are GREASY and GROSS and DRENCHED in oil. This is a symptom of frying in oil that is not hot enough. Although easily remedied, this is a chronic problem at this location. Squeeze the fries sometime when you get home and see what comes out.  The portions are TINY! I was shocked at the size of the bun on my chicken sandwich. It was smaller than a McDonald's hamburger!  I have given them many chances, yesterday's visit was the last. I can tolerate having my order screwed up only so many times and complaining each time to management. It doesn't appear that the company cares about the performance of its locations. There is a wonderful new hamburger place just down the street (rhymes with rabbit) that I'll be taking my business to.  Goodbye Smashburger!",

This restaurant puts a modern day look and feel to an old classic style burger stop shop. The seating environment was decent considering the amount of service during the dinner hours consisting of booths and tables, and the customers even had the choice of sitting outside as well. The place did have a welcoming aroma somewhat like a backyard grill smell. At first glance the restaurant looked pretty clean, but taking a closer look at the tables that had a greasy type texture that remained from previous customers made it seem otherwise. The menu had a vast amount of options to choose from, whether you wanted a beef burger, chicken burger, veggie burger, or even a simple salad was not out of reach. This restaurant is a little on the expensive side of things when it comes to the portion size as well as the quality of food. The fries themselves were overly greasy and doused with seasoning, and the burger itself was juicy and contained fresh ingredients but the patty seemed small. All the food here is made to order and is hand delivered to each table in an expedient manner with excellent customer service. I would say overall from my experience even though the service was inviting the price, environment, and quality of food make this restaurant a not a number one choice. The food itself is not worth the price as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant make it a very unattractive location for friends or family.",

So, I ordered the 1/2 pound BBQ, Bacon & Cheese burger and was quite impressed. It was topped with shoestring onion rings and I also got the Smashfries (prepared w/ rosemary, garlic and olive oil...and YUM YUM!!!) Combined with a soft drink, my whole meal came to about $11. Cheap...not so much. Worth it...I think so. I definitely think they are a lot better than burgers at Rumbi a couple doors down.   I also love an establishment that has CHERRY COKE on hand.

I was in beef heaven initially because, although the burgers were a tad pricey in comparison to the other big fast food joints, the kids meals were very affordable & pretty good sized to boot & the taste of the fresh food combined with the energetic ambience had me \"hook, line & belly\"!   After my 3rd or 4th visit, the kids meals shrank in size (both the burger & amount of fries).  It was disappointing because, I went there with my kids as a treat to them.

My mouth was immediately watering and I went from being slightly hungry to starving in like 3 seconds flat. I had the half pound (which is BIG) BBQ, bacon burger with no substitutions and smashfries. The burger was really good. Like REALLY good. The crisp onion straws were very flavorful and the bun was delicious. I just wish the BBQ sauce had a bit of a kick to it.  The fries were good, however I think I would have enjoyed the regular french fries more.  Can't wait to come back!!!",

(This was really nice of her!) I ordered the chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The only problem is when you take it to go, the fries don't survive! They get wilted and I like 'em crunchy. The sandwich was pretty good - I liked the flavors but the chicken was greasy. I wouldn't order it again, unless the chicken was less greasy. My co-worker enjoyed her food, but I don't always trust her judgment. (I mean, she was okay with limp fries.) If in the area, I might go back. Who knows?",

    "text": "In the West valley? Craving a burger? Smashburger is your only option!  I had never heard of the place, but after driving past it a dozen times, I went with my gut feeling and checked it out.  The small, simple menu contains no bad options. There are a few specialty burgers, which you can get as a 1/2 pound, a 1/3 pound, or a chicken sandwich. You can also choose your own fries, bun, cheese, and other toppings (fried egg, anyone?).  Like anyone else who lets their stomach do the thinking, I ordered a half pound Arizona burger with Smash fries. After a few minutes waiting in a cozy building with friendly staff, my meal had arrived.   The next 30 minutes are a blur.  Habanero pepper jack...chipotle bun...amazing guacamole and onions on a perfectly cooked and seasoned burger? Amazing! On paper, having rosemary garlic fries (and a touch of olive oil) with this does not compute, but you'll forget about that when you're shoving it down your face. This was one mesmerizing meal.  If you choke from eating too fast (I don't blame you, you won't be able to focus on anything but your burger), then order one of the beers they have...a limited selection from nearby breweries like Four Peaks and Sierra Nevada.  Someone is bound to argue with me giving this place five stars, but unless they can find me a better burger around here (NOT the Red Robin or Island across the street. Amateurs!), I refuse to go any lower.",

Also with kids meals now if you want milk or juice they charge you extra.   Their soda machine did not seem to be working properly either or was not cleaned properly.  We tried the coke, diet coke and coke zero and each one of them had a musty taste to it.  The soda was not drinkable.  We informed the girl who took our order ( she was wearing a badge that said certified trainer)  and said she would tell a manager.

A drawback of the location is that the parking lot is very small and there are 4-5 restaurants in this small place so parking is always a problem.  My wife had the 'classic' and she loved it and my spinach, cucumber, goat cheese was very good as well.  Interestingly, they gave you a plastic glass for the fountain drinks rather than a paper one so not sure if that was to save money from people doing a refill before leaving or being a little 'classier' by having an actual glass (even though plastic).  I was very disappointed with the haystack onion rings as they were so frail that when you tried to dip in the sauce that accompanied the dish, they simply fell apart so wasnt sure if they were just breaking or were there actual onion pieces in the coating.  And I felt they were skimpy with the amount given as well.  So, the two stars off was for the parking and the scant amount of onions in the haystack but the burgers were very good.  I also did like the three different teas offered for drinks.",

Tasty food, all good. I love the smash fries and fried pickles are on the \"secret\" menu I think. The burgers are good without being too heavy, and it is easy to customize what you want.

I think if their whole concept and even store name revolves around the word \"Smash\", they should design their store to reflect that.  SHOW US THE SMASHING!!!  Five Guys & In-N-Out, who I would place together in the same category as Smashburger, both have exposed kitchens showing us how clean and freshly prepared their food is.    Next, their burgers are really really greasy.  I think the best beef to fat ratio for a patty is 80/20.  I don't know what their ratios are, but just because they use 100% Angus beef, it shouldn't equate to more grease.  It should equate to more flavor.   And their 'highest-quality-cheeses\" wasn't anything special.   And I really really tasted.  I really did.  Their rosemary/olive oil fries adds another couple of bucks to your meal, which is north of 10$ dollars for a meal.  They're not as good as they sound.  Next time, I'll stick with the regular fries.    I will go back to try again, but so far, Smashburger is just 2 1/2 stars in my book.  The rounding-up because I'm just nice. :D",

    "text": "i had an avocado burger with jalapenos and onions ! it was pretty delicious although I don't recommend the whole grain buns here they're not that good . my boyfriend had a big bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg. it  was really good! We both had smash fries which were not too bad.  Don't get if you don't like rosemary because if had a strong taste of it. Overall it was not too pricey but service and staff was amazing ! Definitely a MUST try !",

My dog with me outside?...check Awesome bacon cheese burger?...check Nutter butter shake?....\"we're out of shakes...didn't have enough time to prep.....don't even have a clean glass\"  Not even a ,\"it might take a minute\", just a straight up \"nope, all out\". Thank you AM 2 CASHIER.  When I broke the news to my wife outside, the awesome Claire over hears and asks me why somebody would say they were out of shakes. And  shortly delivers me a shake after ensuring me it was a mistake.  Thank you Claire for being awesome and extremely professional and completing my perfect lunch.",

    "text": "GREAT burgers!  I would rate this burger place as one of top 5 in the valley - it is that good.  I have been to this store at least 2 dozen times and consistently get a great burger.  NEVER had a bad experience.  Note:  There are several Smashburgers in the valley and I have been to two other stores and not all Smashburgers are the same.  The Avondale store is the best of the three that I've been to.  Nicer staff, better food, cleaner store and better service.  I know, they should all be the same but they're not, trust me.  (The Lake Pleasant & Happy Valley store is the worse).",

The burger needed a little more bbq sauce, it was barely noticeable. The fries were extremely greasy. The box that holds the fries had about 2tbs of oil at the bottom. My husband added blue cheese to his burger and it was never added even though we paid for it.",

The manager or assistant manager shouting across the restaurant to the young cashier to clean up the bathroom and not the dishes or the dining room. I stared at her and she seemed to whisper instead. Friday night and the dining room was a mess. Dirty floors and dirty tables, had to ask to get one cleaned. They forgot a topping and was half wash done with my burger before they brought it out with no customers in line. With many other locations, I will probably skip this one.",

    "text": "I used to go to Smashburger often.  Hadn't been there in a while.  Stopped to grab a burger and when I ordered, I was very specific that I wanted the mayo on the side.  I ordered it to go so I sat and waited patiently.  I noticed she kept saying to the guys in the back that she needed a side of mayo for my order.  I very politely told her that I did not want the mayo on the burger, but on the side.  She didn't say a word or even acknowledge me.  When I got my burger home, it had the mayo all over it...actually spilling out of it and it was a MESS! SmashFries were pretty much the kind of fries that have been sitting there for a while. Not fresh at all.  I did call and speak to the manager about the situation and he was really nice about it and informed me that I would have my next burger free when (IF) I decide to go back.    I hate giving such a negative review about this place because typically we have a very positive experience there.  Just feel like these types of things shouldn't happen.    Again, the manager was super nice and helpful.  So that is why I didn't knock down the stars any more than I already did.    This is why I should NOT have cheated on my diet...damn you STRESS! DAMN YOU!",

    "text": "Went back again, same great service as before, very busy lunch hour and yet service was fast, place was clean, and they had plenty of people working .    Food was great, my ONLY complaint was that I ordered bacon on Burger for an extra $1.50 and got ONE PIECE broken into 4 small strips.  I asked a manager if that was really $1.50 worth of bacon and he said yes, then brought me another \"serving\" which I thought was very good service, but I'll know next time not to waste the $$$.  We had build it yourself large burger, SMASHFRIES that are excellent!, and soda and wife had Arizona burger and fried pickles and soda.  Bil was $23.50 (much more expensive than regular fast food but worth it occasionally.  Burgers are greasier than most places, which I think makes them better.  It was the first meal after a 36 hour fast for a medical test and it was awesome:) BYOB: \"Bring Your Own Bacon\" :)",
