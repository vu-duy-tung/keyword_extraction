I also highly recommend the Ahi & Avocado Poke (appetizer) - the texture is made more interesting with the taro chips & the ahi is super fresh. Also had the Hamachi wheel - YES YES YES!  Definitely get the hoke poke roll, and the Loch Ness roll CANNOT be missed. Lots of other great rolls as well. Have never been disappointed in a visit to PURE! And a central Phoenix location too. A+++",

Everything was fine until I checked my bank account and notice I was being charged more than what I had paid for my total was 178 and I left cash tip so I wasn't expecting to see 208 dollars charge on my card. Clearly the server decided that it was ok to STEAL from his customers and add an extra tip to himself. When I called the manager was not helpful she said she was going to look into it and call back but she never bother to call back. So I had to call them again and finally they reimburse my money. The manager tried to make excuses for his dishonest employee. So be careful when going here.",

A miso soup with yummy mushrooms was also included with this order. It was a quick lunch for me, and I must say I like it here. I'm definitely coming back to try more of their delicious food when I have more time. Bon Appetit everyone!!",

We're from CA and there seems to be better sushi there all around.     My Wife had the yakisoba and it was awesome!   Highly suggest that.     I've been 20 times or so and always get rolls and nigiri.   It's better than most around here, but again, it's not the best we've ever had.    Definitely worth trying.   Ambiance is really good.   Staff is attentive.   Management seems involved on a consistent basis.",

I wish they would...it can effect the evening if you have to talk loudly over a table to hear the conversation. The meals were all delicious and everyone was happy with the presentation! The service was friendly and made some great suggestions off the menu. It's nice when servers are pleasant and helpful! We had a wonderful evening and will return again! Thanks",

    "text": "Yesterday I ate lunch here at the sushi bar in back. It was a very good experience. It's kind of a strip mall place, but there is outdoor seating with a pass through bar to the inside, and the vibe inside is trendy and feels like a great happy hour and casual dinner kind of place. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably come here a lot.  I started with the seaweed salad and a bowl of miso soup. The seaweed came out of a very cold refrigerator! I had to turn out the bowl onto a plate and let it rest a bit before eating it. However, the portion size was generous and it tasted good.  The miso soup took me back to the first time I ever had miso--about 30 years ago in NYC. I've got to say, in that time period since there's been a lot of miso soup in my life--a lot of it buttery, cloudy, you know the drill--but the miso soup at Pure Sushi had that throwback taste I hardly ever get to experience anymore. It was smokier, fishier, and I liked that.  I like rolls, but I prefer pieces of fish. That can get tricky if you don't know what your getting is going to be fresh. I rolled the dice and won.  Started with tuna. Five pieces, rich and fresh.   Asked for halibut, but there was not any available (which didn't deter me because that is common at sushi restaurants). So I asked the chef what he likes and he recommended the walu. It was AHH. MAAAZING!!! Walu, also called white tuna, is light, white and buttery. It was served (two pieces) over lovely seasoned rice and had a tiny dab of relish on each piece which was to die for. Such perfect bites.  Because it was lunch it was quiet and only a few tables were occupied. The chef talked to me, since I was dining alone, and that was very nice. He was friendly, made good recommendations, and is a good conversationalist.  I'd totally go here again for lunch. But it looks like they have some pretty good happy hour goodies, too, and if you go for dinner, you can count on it being fresh and to your liking.",

I've had sushi in Japan and i boast of many other alcolades in regard to my sushi history which adds to my rich credibility to this specific epicurean experience which the world has come to appreciate....  This Lock Ness Roll (primarily the side in the red sauce) is a perfect bite and i think will please anyone who prefers subtleties of sashimi, although this is not traditional.    The rice-free LOCK NESS ROLL, is an experience in texture and flavour.  Although the sauce offers a bold explosion on the taste buds, the sauce subsides almost immediately allowing one to sense the subtle combination of salmon avocados and asparagus, which is revealed to the olfactory in layers in that order.    This roll is most likely not going to be appreciated by the typical western sushi afficcionado who drowns every bite in soy sauce.  This is a concoction for  those who have a refined pallet.  There is no need to add soy sauce or Ponzu, for the (red, not green) sauce truly makes this roll powerfully bold without overwhelming the subtleties reminiscent of sashimi, but with a more gregarious sabor.   I consider this a perfect Fusion of East meets west.  Thank you for this creation.  The Lock Ness Roll is a True event in culinary arts, I hope you enjoy it too.",

I didn't taste it, but he said it was good.  I dunno.   I was not really impressed with the place.   Judging by how empty it is, I am thinking others are not flocking to the place.

Most of the items are $3-4 - Rolls are $3-8 and there are items like potstickers/goyza ($3) and pork sliders ($4) for your non-sushi-eating friends.   With the discount, drinks drop to about $4 too!  Pro tip: Don't let the crowded parking in front intimidate you. There's a HUGE parking lot in the back. :)",

The miso soup tasted like straight ocean and not in a good way. The nigiri I ordered were all very fishy and some slices were even dry. There was even a slice that was not only very fishy, but had sinew and was extremely difficult to eat. The fish in my roll had the same fishy taste.   I really hope this was just a one time deal, but if they're not watching their quality of products then I don't believe I'd come back.  I was even talking this place up the night before returning and now I feel dumb :(",

Slow early evening on a Saturday... only 2 other couples at the bar, nobody at the sushi bar, and 3 parties in the dining area. While the staff at the bar was friendly, they were more social with their fellow staff than with the customers. While its fine to talk with co workers, this should not come at the price of inattentive service... especially when its slow! They failed to serve our fist course (edamame), brought out the third course (desert of chocolate mouse) within 5 minutes of bringing out the entree', and when a to go box was requested for items, it was merely dropped in our dining space rather than graciously boxing the food for us. I'm not usually one to require a server to do this as I was a server and bartender for years and can easily accomplish the task, but for the prices and pretentiousness this place exudes, the service was definitely not above the bar. Again... they didn't fail (well, except with the edamame) and the items were tasty, but there is a disconnect in the service that again feels more superficial than what locals usually experience in Central Phoenix...",

I like sushi for the fresh ingredients. I feel like all the sauce was hiding something from me. For the price I would try somewhere else nearby like Hanna (missoiri and 7th ave) or Yama (central south of camelback). You get much better fish for a lower price.",

    "text": "Went for lunch today with a friend. I read all of the other reviews and all I can figure out is that everyone comes here for the happy hour deals and must have a few before reviewing this place. The atmosphere is trendy/chic. No complaint there. We were greeted promptly, but it was weird. We walked in and from the back the manager shouts \"How do I look?\" My friend replies \"great \". He walks towards us and repeats his question. My friend told him she already said he looked great,but that she must not have heard her. He said well \"You look amazing. How are you? How have you been?\" The whole exchange was kind of awkward since neither of us had ever met him before. It got more strange when the manager told my friend to pick a spot we could sit anywhere and as she moved toward a booth he said \"but not in a booth\". She took it as kidding, but honestly he didnt say anything to us . Anyway, we tried the calamari, it was rubbery and tasteless, the pesto sauce that accompanied it was thin, oily and did nothing to add flavor. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Next we ordered a caterpillar roll, a fiery dragon roll and a California roll. I must admit the caterpillar roll wasn't too bad, but there was nothing exceptional about it. I wouldn't order a California roll again it was dull and bland. The fiery dragon was one of the specialty rolls and it was a disappointment.  The fish wasn't fresh, it would have no flavor whatsoever if not for the jalapeno and cilantro. But there was no fusion of flavor instead the first taste was bland,  the less than fresh fish didn't help, and then your mouth just burned from the jalapeno. Finally, we were never offered refills of our water, we waited for over 15 minutes after we had finished for our check despite the manager and our server walking past us frequently. Maybe we just hit on an off day.",

Ambience was ok -- noise level was pretty loud, but it was packed, and there was a table of four women behind us who were cackling at such an improbable volume that we realized the True noise level of the restaurant once they finally left.   Prices are a little on the high side, but you get what you pay for.   The service was just fair. The staff was not particularly friendly. As the plates of appetizers & finished sushi piled up, no one who worked there (including our server) felt it was a good idea to clear the table. It got kind of embarrassing for a while before our server finally decided she would lower herself to that of a busgirl. Not a deal-breaker, but no question the staff would benefit from more training and an attitude adjustment.  Do get the Asian BBQ ribs. Best we've ever had!",

When you stop in make sure you say \"Hi\" to the manager Phil and ask him for his recommendations.  His suggestions were perfect each time.  Second, the ambience is modern and sleek with a cool tree motive. The tables have phone charges built right in to the wall and if that wasn't enough, It even has a basket in the bathroom large enough to hide in. No kidding. Check it out yourself.  Ask Phil about it, he will fill you in on the cool interior design.  And last, and most importantly, the food and beverage choices.  I have eaten a lot of Sushi, some even fresh, right off the hook while on the boat, and this blows them all away.  The traditional dishes, sashimi, miso soup, sushi, etc are what you would expect, but better and fresher.  Make sure you ask for the fresh wasabi to go with these.  The rolls and fusion style dishes are fun and inventive.  The Shrimp Dynamite was...well dynamite.  They also have the largest Saki selection that I have ever seen.  Phil selected a light Saki for us that was crisp and slightly sweet and went perfect with the food.  So in summary: the restaurant is cool, the food is fantastic and Phil is awesome.",

When she was waiting on her other tables she had a smile on her face, but any time she came over to our table she looked annoyed to be talking to us. I had ordered chicken Katsu and when the food arrived it looked great. Unfortunately, I took a couple of bites of it and it was like a rubbery texture so I had my co-workers try a piece each and they agreed. It made me lose my appetite and I let the waitress know that it has a super weird texture. She then said \"well it looks like you've eaten some of it so.....?\" Not once did she apologize. I get that people have their off days but she was blatantly rude to us and for absolutely no reason. This was the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.",

She knows her sushi for sure, and recommended the most amazing rolls for us to try.    I would definitely keep coming back to Pure Sushi and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great night out.

Struts over in his suit and asks how everything is... and then walks away when my friends mother was complimenting the food.  He goes \"oh yeah that.. uh... beef thing is good\".  Dude if you don't give a sh!t, don't go around pretending to.  People can see thru your BS especially when you turn your back to them after asking a question!

They are large portioned and the price is very reasonable. I ordered the sea bass bento ($15). It came with ~5oz (?) moist sea bass, salad, tempura with shrimp, and rice. I also ordered a side a salmon sashimi ($10). Honestly, the bento alone was good enough, I just couldn't keep myself from ordering some sushi too. The sashimi pieces were fresh and pretty thick. I love that they didn't give me small, thin pieces. But $2 a piece is pretty steep for me. Service was fast and helpful. I will have to come back for their happy hour menu next time.  Note:  - If you return within 7 days with you receipt you get a discount on your next visit :)  - also theres a wall/usb charger at every booth and sushi bar seat !!

So the fact that they have it on the weekend is awesome, and it wasn't even very crowded. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive, taking our orders soon after we sat down.  For our meal, we ordered the Shrimp Tempura, the Ika Tempura (Calamari), and the Korean BBQ Grilled Pork Ribs. The portions weren't huge, but it filled us up and everything was delicious! I also ordered a beer and my boyfriend got a large sake - the bill was still only $30! Definitely a great spot when you're looking to not spend a ton :)",

The spicy tuna lettuce wraps were cool, crisp, and refreshing. The sliders were pretty basic, pulled pork with bbq sauce. The poke was an interesting presentation in that it was served on taro chips, kind of like an Asian tostada. I liked the marinade in the poke and the fish was fresh. The rolls were a great deal for happy hour at $3 each.  Service was friendly and warm.   I'll definitely be back for more sushi!",

As someone who comes here a lot I was super upset on how I was treated and will definitely not be back. I supposed good service closes before the restaurant does.",

Parking is not an issue even though it looks limited at the front; here is parking at the side and in the back of the Colony complex.",

She ordered the yellowtail sushimi lunch.  The Nabeyaki Udon tasted like soy sauce mixed with water microwave heated.  The soup was inedible.  Not sure how anyone could eat that.  I ended up trying to find the few pieces of shrimp and scallops in the soup.  That tasted like it was quickly like it was quickly thawed from something that was stored in the freezer for way too long.  Maybe they should hire someone who knows what they are doing.  Never order Udon from this place.  I can make 10 times better Udon broth at home.  The WTF Roll was good.  I actually liked it.  I would give the WTF Roll 4 stars by itself.  My friend said the yellowtail sushimi wasn't up to their usually standard but decent.  Edamame was good but its hard to get that one wrong. :)  Waitress wasn't very bright.  She kept on getting the order wrong for both of us.",

    "text": "Placed a take out order tonight including both sushi as well as hot dishes.  Arrived at precisely the time they told me my order would be ready.  I checked in with the hostess, who verifies my order.  There are several to go orders on the floor, next to the hostess stand, which is right next to their front door.  Not refrigerated.  When she hands me my order, I ask if the hot foods were packaged together with the sushi.  She gives me a clueless look and the other girl, looking somewhat alarmed/concerned, said yes, everything has been put in the same bag.  I then ask how long the food has been sitting out there.  They clearly had no idea, but gave me a sheepish guesstimate of \"maybe 5-10\" minutes.  5-10 minutes of chirashi and sashimi sitting next to a door letting in 110 degree heat doesn't bode well. The two girls at the hostess station were very polite, so this is not a knock on them.  But someone should probably figure out a safer way to store takeout sushi orders that minimizes their exposure to hot, cooked dishes, as well as the hot Arizona summers.  The 2 stars is for my experience today only.  This was my 2nd visit.  My first visit was completely fine.  Hopefully someone in management reads this and makes adjustments before someone gets sick.",

After a few minutes standing up front, noticing the manager on his cell phone and employees standing around talking, someone finally came by to say we could sit anywhere grabbing menus, you would think to follow us. My husband and I choice to sit outside. No menus were handed to us or came behind us. After sitting for a bit, I just went in and got some menus. We had enough time to figure out what we wanted for dinner before our server brought out some water. We placed an order of edamame and 5 rolls, which he repeated back. Not long after one of the employees brought out 3 of the 5 rolls and no edamame. My husband and I not waiting to wait for the rest ate all three rolls as we were hungry. Our server came back a while after we finished and asked if we needed anything else and I replied \"maybe the rest of our dinner\" and my husband added \"and some water\" as he was out. He said he was going to go check on it. He left and came right back to having no idea what we ordered so I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and said so I hear you asked to speak to me, I said YES, let me start with when we first walked in and explaining everything above. He explained everyone dropped the ball, and our meal was on us. I don't think the ball was ever pick up and I asked for the owner or GMs information to them know about our magical experience. He left to go get the GMs card and well we were waiting no water was brought or the rest of our order. We then hear inside our server said to another employee \"I don't care I didn't do anything wrong.\" The manager still not wanting to correct the situation by refilling water or the rest of our dinner brought out his card, the GMs card and a gift card to ask us back. Well since I now had to go home and make dinner since we did not get to eat, I can't see myself returning. Small details as the whole experience was horrible but I had to go inside and get my saucer for soy sauce and soy sauce as ours was empty at our table.",

    "text": "Came into Pure for te first time yesterday for happy hour. Got there around 4:30 and was surprised to see the place pretty empty. We walked in and saw three hostesses all waiting to help us, or so we thought. We walked in, were briefly greeted, and then upon asking us how many, the hostesses proceeded to look among each other almost to see who really wanted to help us first. Not the most welcoming experience at first. We were seated and within seconds, waters were filled which was nice. Our server came up almost immediately and asked if we wanted anything besides water. We weren't sure just yet since we literally just sat down, but soon found some drinks we wanted: white cosmos.   Ordered some sushi, all of which was delicious. Rainbow roll, spicy tuna rolls, and an avocado roll. Very tasty.   Now here's the issue. Drinks didn't come out to us until after our sushi was delivered. When we finally received them, they were wrong. When we asked our server about them, she proceeded to tell us that what we ordered was what we received. Obviously not. These drinks are supposed to have raspberry vodka but instead tasted like peach or pear and had a cherry at the bottom. Our server proceeded to tell us that we were tasting the peach schnapps. Our server didn't seem to believe is still, and pulled out the menu to look. Our drinks were supposed to have three ingredients, none of which are peach schnapps or cherries. She took our drinks back and we were eventually given new ones. The bartender brought them out, apologized, and said that's how she was trained to make them but had to look up the recipe. By this time our sushi was gone so we just had to sit and sip the drinks.   Overall, not the greatest service experience, but did was good, which is what gives this review 3 stars. Will consider coming back since the sushi is good and it's close to home, but not right away.",

    "text": "We just left Pure Sushi a few minutes ago after a bad experience.  In our opinion, the sushi and other bites were awful.  The sushi rice was horribly overcooked, the rolls were tasteless (if you can even imagine that!) and the asian style pork ribs were sugary, rubbery messes.  We tasted each item, which was all brought to our table all at the same time, with no thought as to coursing it out, and each bite left us disappointed.  While we had an entire table of food, the manager saw me holding out my credit card.  He came over and took the card.  He did not ask about the full table of food that we obviously had not and were not eating.  Our waitress came over after our card was run, and we paid the bill in full ($139) plus a nice tip ($28).  The waitress was very nice and the fact that the food was terrible was not her fault.  We sat for some period of time while we finished our Saki, thinking the manager at some point would at least come over to discuss our thoughts and comments.  But he never did.  When we left, we saw him standing sheepishly back by the kitchen.  Whomever owns this place should be very concerned about a manager who failed to evaluate the situation and try to at least listen.  This left us with no choice but to post this online.  At the end of the day, we really felt that the food was bad.  We will tell everyone we know to avoid Pure Sushi based on our experience.  On a final note, we are experienced diners, having traveled extensively and eaten at many of the world's 3 Michelin starred restaurants.  We admittedly have high standards.  Unfortunately, Pure Sushi is pure nonsense.",

    "text": "It must have been an off day. Called for pick-up for a late lunch and every question I had, I had to be placed on hold. When I arrived, there was only 1 customer but it took a few minutes for someone to come to the hostess table. I ordered a sushi and sashimi combo. Let's start with the best part. In Japan, you take years of training on how to use the knife and cut the perfect part of the fish at the perfect angle. Let's come back to that. You also spend some time perfecting the rice. It's easy to cook rice but it's hard to cook it with the right consistency similar to al dente pasta. You can over cook, under cook, have it be too firm or have it be too mushy. Well folks, this is what was done right! Excellent job, rice cooker! The salmon was good but the other two sashimi items were a bit fishy (good quality sushi isn't that fishy) and the angle cut for one of them made the fish sort of sinewy as if eating a cheap cut of steak. Since it's a relatively new restaurant, I'm willing to give it another try once they work on the kinks. Some tips, package salad dressing on the side as the salad gets wilted when tossed with dressing. Do not use leaves with black/brown edges; it's just back for presentation. The dogs says thanks for some sashimi treats this afternoon.",

Hapoy hour sent out the door went for the menu to many good things. Though out of uni they still managed to give me amazing quality sushi. Very fresh great variety an amazing menu. Far above many sushi places  in town. I knew the food and service would bring me uptown again for there food. Though not ready to give up my search for uni. Ringing daily the kitchen manager Art put up with  calls. Pleasantly a week to the day I first went in they had it.  My second time in was as good as the first if not better. Ben did not disappoint! They have somthing for everyone.(fyi they are a glutin free resteraunt) they also do  No carbs the lollipop roll is an example of that. Dont like fish they have duck  and other non aquatic meals. Though I'm not drinking at the moment( part of the new years resolution) the drinks looked amazing as well. Not to discount there happy hour which is great!",

Are these not made fresh? The Vegas Roll was pretty standard but I did like that when you get it to go, they put the sauces on the side so the roll doesn't get mushy. I did like being able to control how much sauce was on my roll too. My one roll was $13 plus tax so a little pricey but overall I think this would be a good happy hour sushi spot. Staff was very friendly and service was quick (if it wasn't, since I was the only one there, that would have been very disturbing).",

The last time I had their food, I ordered yakisoba to go, not sushi. It was awful. This time I ordered sushi: the lochness sushi and the hoke poke roll based on other reviews. We also ordered the miso spicy butter edamame to start.   First off, the decor and ambiance was fancy. I really liked it. They even offered a nice looking highchair for my daughter. The only con is that they do not have a changing diaper table in the restroom. Our waitress was the only waitress in the restaurant and she worked the room well.   Skip the spicy miso butter edamame. I did not enjoy it, but the sushi was amazing. Each roll though had only eight small pieces for $15-$16 a roll. Kinda pricy to me. I took advantaged of the check in offer of 15% off your bill so that helped a bit. Overall, good sushi and good ambiance.",

A friendly sushi chef and the manager both talked about some of their selections and offered some suggestions.  Fantastic sashimi and rolls.  We came in a second time for lunch and also sat at the sushi bar.  We split a teriyaki chicken bento box, the sushi/sashimi lunch plate and also got a couple of rolls.  That was more than enough food.  The bento box was tasty.  The sashimi plate was impressive for the price and quality was superb.  Nice big cuts of fresh fish.  So tasty!  And they have fresh wasabi.  Make sure to ask for it with your sushi.  So nice to have this in the neighborhood.  We will return again and again.",

This may have been the best sushi i've had in phoenix. Even the edamame was outstanding. The fish (tuna, scallop and unagi) was near perfect and the hokey poke roll was on point. I dont mind paying a little more for quality and i will def be dining here again.1",

I have an extremely open mind when it comes to trying new foods. But I tasted good quality sushi before and at this place the sushi tastes HORRIBLE. The costumer service overall is all bad. I waited a good half hour for some shitty food. I came back a few times even after the bad experience, but I still got the same bad outcome for this sushi restaurant. Not sorry.

Drinks - one star  Both time I went i had sake, it was good and warm  And I know they sell lucky Buddha which you can't really find anywhere - Thai beer on a sushi bar is weird but we love it  Culture - zero star  it's white wash. Front entering and leaving I didn't not felt a bit like stepping into little Japan. When I want sushi I want to get away and going here I felt like I was stepping into a club/sport bar - breaks my hard   Service - no starts  slow! Not very busy night took very long time to get a miso which I know is already made and the sashimi just 4 pieces just way to long   Conclusion - one star The nigiri and sashimi was not bad  I would get rip of the roll many and really re look into what make sense. Rolls like the lobster roll didn't make one sense  I my head I saw something different that did make sense.  The touch with the lucky Buddha  The sake was very good   3 stars is a good rate You should be proud",

Whenever I'm back in the AZ area, I remark on its growth, and the Colony seemed to have popped up out of nowhere, so we decided to pop into Pure Sushi. Apparently, we should have done this earlier; they offered Happy Hour from 11-6 on Sundays, and the fish was rather pricey.  I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was so happy I went with hers; the Loch Ness roll had no rice, rather wrapped in salmon with some asparagus and a little dollop of spice. It was as though Phoenix had newly discovered an ocean per the freshness. I will be back, but not sure I can justify spending $16 on this luxury if I can't pull my it's-my-birthday card.",

I didn't know since it was happy hour if the rolls were full roll or half, so I did order a few, hindsight I guess I could have asked, but it really didn't matter.  I ordered California rolls, spicy tuna roll, and Philadelphia roll along with lettuce wraps.   The rolls were full order and just what I was craving but the winner for me was the lettuce wraps, it was 4 lettuce wraps with spicy tuna spicy, yakiniku sauce, fried wontons, wasabi mayo, wasabi tobiko all for $5, They had great flavor and just was so fresh. Just so good!   The is a great place to go to if looking for good happy hour deals! I know I will be back soon!",

    "text": "This is a review for take out only The good: The salmon tasted great, cut nicely, rice was seasoned properly. The confit duck steam buns: generous serving of meat, well seasoned, the pickled veggies added a nice acidity and crunch. The yakisoba with chicken was well seasoned and the noodles were cooked nicely and tasty. The not so good: the pieces of yellowtail was disappointing as it was poorly cut with bones found in the filet. And while the duck meat in the steamed buns was good, the bun itself was pretty tough which made it inedible.  They do have a extensive menu and I would be willing to try more items on their menu like specialty rolls etc",

Usually, I find the best sushi is in a small shady corner and this place proved me wrong. the atmosphere was very chic and looked very modern. The staff was uber friendly, kind, and patient. My friend wanted to have some sweet tea and they understood her love for some good 'ol southern sweet tea and made her homemade simple syrup. What a great gesture all for the sake of pleasing the customer. I thought that was amazing.   We have the lobster spring rolls... amazing, and pretty hefty Also the coconut shrimp... don't forget to take advantage of the mango jam they serve with it (omg delicious). I ordered the Harikari veggie fried rice and it was super duper fresh and you can tell because the veggies are still bright and look alive. My friend also ordered the loch ness roll??? something with Irish/Scottish salmon  Overall, I am going to visit there prettttttty often now that I know I have a sushi spot so close to me",

    "text": "I love coming here for the sushi and the squid salad, although there are many other options such as teriyaki chicken or noodles just to name a few. This evening I ordered the squid salad, miso soup and the spicy tuna roll since I wasn't so hungry lol. My husband ordered a miso soup and Pure's Teriyaki with chicken. We both really enjoyed our food choices and ate every single bit of it. We've been here once before for happy hour and it was fantastic. They have so many options on their happy hour menu and we nearly ordered almost all of it last time.  The only reason that I didnt give the restaurant 5 stars is due to the service. Don't get me wrong, the service was not horrible but we did not get the feeling of being welcomed. When we walked in we were not greeted, the hostess just looked at us and asked \"two\" we said yes and were walked to a table. It took the server a little longer than it should have to greet us, the restaurant was not very busy. After taking our drink and food order she did do a much better job at checking in on us to make sure we were ok. I work in customer service so I tend to notice customer service right away. Upon leaving, we were also ignored by the two hostesses. They were very involved in their conversation with one another that they couldn't take a few seconds to acknowledge us or even thank us for dining at the restaurant.  Customer service in this situation is the only con for not receiving 5 stars. The food is worth it though.",

My partner and I hadn't ate anything today and thought this would be a good place for a late lunch/early dinner. Sadly we were both wrong. When we entered we were the only customers at the start of happy hour. We sat at the sushi bar. The servers were mediocre and carried on talking about their personal lives in front of us and other customers that continued to walk in. We waited patiently for our food and drinks, but eventually had to remind the server for them. I noticed one of the sushi cooks take off his prep gloves at one point, take out his cell phone to reply to a text, rest his hand on the garbage can, then proceed to help his peer make a roll (which happened to be our last role, of course!).   Now that I am at home the stomach gurgles continue and I only hope that no one else suffers in the same way. Save your money and go down the street to an authentic sushi place- the sushi station!",

You can get a huge bento box or a sushi and sashimi lunch. The best time to go is happy hour. There are rolls for only $3. Oh and they even have happy hour on weekends, from 3-6.",

The last time I was there on a Friday night with no reservation the manager HIGHLY recommend reservations. So tonight I googled Pure Sushi Colony and reservation tab directed me to YELP. So really my point here, is to YELP, Yelp. We arrived and there was no reservation. ALSO between the time I made the reso and arrived I had received TWO text messages that I have plans at 7 and it's almost time for my reservation.  So I am sure that Yelp took my reservation. They just didn't secure it Great service. I'm sticking with Open Table restaurants.",

The tempura shrimp  was good   the teriyaki  chicken was a chicken  breast that was way overcooked  and a light amount of sauce. There was too much Bell peppers winter the vegetables.

Additionally, their happy hour prices are exceedingly cheap. Unfortunately, the food and drinks are not also exceedingly good. I had the basil lemonade drink... it was almost undrinkable. This thing was so strong (but not in a good way) and lacked any real flavor of lemon or basil.... it was hard to finish. I tried a few different rolls, which all were huge in girth making them difficult to eat and just ok in flavor. We also tried the gyoza (from frozen)... not good, the calamari (probably also from frozen)... not good, and the pork sliders (actually fairly tasty). Despite the good price, I don't see a reason to return.",

My overall experience was disappointing due to the hostesses. There were three and they were in need of basic training. When I walked into the restaurant they stared at me rather than greet me. I took the initiative to tell them I was picking up an order and one of the hostesses handed me a bill (still without saying anything). I paid and finally one spoke, thanking me, and said she'd get my order. Two of the hostesses walked away. The hostess who remained began talking to a friend. She told her friend all about how much staff turnover the restaurant was experiencing, how she was training the woman who had just walked away, how another staff member had been fired because she lied about her age and other restaurant gossip.   Given the prices on the menu, I would hope staff would be taught to create a positive experience and environment. I might go back, but I'll likely go somewhere else if I'm craving sushi again.",

Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were very disappointed. It was a mediocre sushi place; the rolls weren't great and the appetizers weren't anything special (calamari, gyoza, seaweed salad). I came back a few weeks later to give it another shot and was just disappointed once again. The service is definitely excellent and the prices are decent.",

Then, like 10 minutes later she returns to the table to ask \"Did you want that item?\"  I said, yes, I had ordered it with you and you wrote it down.  She never came back to check on us.  The other wait staff filled drinks and such.  She didn't know if a bowl of rice came with entrees or orders.  Menu:  3 stars  The $25 sashimi plate does NOT even come with a 25 cent bowl of rice. This is unheard of in Japanese restaurants. They want to nickel and dime you.  Rice should come included with the sashimi plate. The sashimi was okay. The yellow tail tuna smelled fishy, but I didn't get food poisoning.   I got the hamachi kama (yellowtail). It was okay. It also did not come with a simple, low cost bowl of rice. Nickel and dimed again.  It tasted okay.    Atmosphere:  2 stars  Extremely loud inside. Horrible acoustics design, sound just bounces off of everything.  They had no booths available which was odd.    Overall:  2.5 stars.  Likely won't return here.  Bill for my 2 items ended up being $52 with tax and tip.  Much higher priced than most Japanese restaurants. Paying for the attempted trendiness of the place, the interior decorating, etc.",

Ordered the coconut tiger shrimp as a starter, which is 4 deep fried shrimps drizzled with some dark salty sauce and 2 dips (sweet chili and some mango flavored one). It was tasty but  kind of salty, heavily breaded, not very coconut-y, and kind of pricey. My mom ordered the nabeyaki udon, which was good and came in a cool bowl but the broth was too salty. I ordered the salmon and avocado rice bowl, which is kind of like a poke bowl. It was fine but the rice to toppings ratio was a bit high and there wasn't enough sauce so it was pretty dry and not that flavorful.

We enjoyed the Pure Asian Pear Martini and ice cold Sapporo. Fire dragon and the White Monster rolls were tasty and fresh. Ask for fresh Wasabi on the side, great alternative to the usual green stuff.   Clinton and Phil were very friendly and helpful. Thanks for creating such an amazing interior design too. We're looking forward to more original art work.",

    "text": "Holy moly, this place is amazing!!   My boyfriend and i decided to go on a lil sunday date night and do sushi, we are so pleased we will defenitly be returning customers!   Started off with our awesomely funky server samantha! Ask for her, she is happy and full of smiles, i love that when i eat out. What goes best with sushi? SAKE! she suggested a chrysanthamum water and it was delicious!   The whole meal was spot on!!   Things to definitely try:  Ahi & avocado poke- its kind of like a sushi take on open face nachos but instead of torrilla chips the poke is on taro chips. Yumm yumm! The small details of parmesan cheese and truffle oil pull it together.  Loch ness roll- this thing. Wow!! Its a roll.. but not like you have ever experienced!! There is no rice or seaweed, the outside is literally wrapped in salmon! Very colorful and visually has a yin yang vibe. It has a nice flavor, kinda spicy with a dab of sriracha on top and fresh with cilantro avocado and asparagus. Can i have this everyday please?!  Hamachi spoons- yellowtail wrapped around avocado with some fresh zesty sauce served in soup spoons. Super fun presentation and will cool you down on any hot summer day.  Our dinner was absolutely delightful, also make sure to order some FRESH wasabi this stuff will make you never want that green mushie stuff again.",

They cut the rolls and serve the pieces side by side flat to make it appear you are getting a huge roll.  The rice was watery and the tuna sashimi looked grey on the edge. We ordered several items to try and not one was something I would eat again.  The scallop roll had no visible scallops. Heading back to Wild Tuna, Moto, or Sushi Station next time.  Update- driving home sick to my stomach.  Ugghhh",

They have a \"gluten sensitive\" menu but I actually was able to modify items not on that menu to fit my dietary needs. I was SO excited to see that they have gluten free tempura. I have never seen that and it was amazing that I could modify the roll that I wanted to be gluten free, even though it contained tempura shrimp. They also have gluten free soy sauce, as expected.  The service was great. Our server was very patient with me questions and was at our table often to check on us.   The sushi is very reasonably priced - we got two rolls (speciality rolls), one order sashimi, one order of nigiri and an entree for around $55. Not bad at all! And it was all very yummy! Also was so happy to find surf clam (it's very hard to find in Phoenix)!!",

    "text": "We walked into this place on a Sunday afternoon, and I was impressed by the set up, looked fancy, yet chic.  We were quickly greeted by a chef, and taken to our table; they have tables, booths, high bar tables, it's nice.  We were given a Happy Hour menu (yay), a dinner menu, and a sheet to mark our selections.  After that, our waitress came to meet us w/ a pitcher of water in her hand ready to fill up our cups, NICE! She was really nice, and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.  The menu has a great selection, and the prices will NOT break your wallet, they had simple rolls for $3, $4, dollars and some specialty rolls for $7-7-9 dollars in their Happy Hour Menu. Their sake bombers are $8, and they come with a large beer and a large sake.   We took a few minutes to look at the menu, we we decided to stick to the Happy Hour selection; we order their fried calamari and the ahi avocado poke for appetizers, and for sushi rolls, we chose a spicy tuna, rainbow roll, baked lobster and the fire dragon. We also order 2 sake bombers.  The appetizers came out first, both were really good, I loved the ahi poke, the calamari was \"ok\", but the sauce they served it with was NASTY, I just ate the calamari w/ some lime and soy sauce instead.  When the rolls came, I was impressed by the size, they were actually big, filled w/ meat, and they all tasted delicious.  Our waitress kept check on on us to make sure we were taken care of, she was great.  At the end, our bill came out to less than $60.00, and we had some sushi left over!   If you go during Happy Hour, definitley take advantage of it. I am looking forward to go back!",
