    "text": "Firebirds has a somewhat limited menu.  As many people know, this can be a good thing if the food the restaurant specializes in is amazing.  Based on that mentality, Firebirds bills itself as specializing in steak, since those are the main items on the menu.  Unfortunately, the steak isn't fantastic.  It's not bad by any means, but it just isn't that great.  I had the prime rib but was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  Something is just missing, and the au jus doesn't salvage much.  We also had the filet mignon (also bland?!).  The one thing I can say is that the pre-dinner bread is really good - so that gets them a star (sad if the bread is their saving grace, isn't it?).    The service was friendly and the decor is nice.   This overall made for a nice evening out.  It's also conveniently near the Chandler Fashion mall.  The price is on the steep side, but that's not surprising since their primary entree is steak.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  Some of the cheaper steak chain restaurants have better food.",

    "text": "I always forget to review this place! I've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year...definitely good enough to return (we went last Friday night) but I think the reasons I don't return more often are: a) a bit pricey ($5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy) b) menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique c) there are so many other restaurants--especially in that Chandler Mall area--that something else always wins out  That being said, I've never had a bad experience. Steaks/Prime Rib have always been cooked exactly as I ordered and the Salmon is wonderful too. Wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but, alas...  Service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty. Like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well.  Yes, I would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above.",

The best thing I have eaten there was the Delmonico steak and the grilled flounder (not on the menu, but it should be).

I'm not going to say how bad the food was, but instead I'm going to try it again - just to see if its me, or the food!  Well the fried spinach tasted like sheets of greased toilet paper (if you can imagine that) and the mash potatoes had a stronger metalic after taste.  Everything about the potatoes said \"don't eat me!\".  The fish wasn't too bad, however.   The waitress stood right behind me and was bascially shouting in my ear, so much so that I moved my seat. But its a real cute place, and the wine was excellent!",

All that said, the reason I love this place is their customer service. Megan was our server and she was exceptional. She recommended cocktails (which we had) and consistently checked on us.

I had to add salt and pepper to my steak because it lacked flavor. Also this piece of prime rib was mostly fat. I cook steaks at home and know all about marbeling and how it gives flavor but there needs to be an even balance between the fat and meat otherwise you just feel ripped off. I still feel going to Outback Steakhouse will give you better tasting steaks with lower prices. The location on Chandler Blvd had never disappointed. Sorry Firebirds you're just not for us.",

I felt a little neglected and lacked the full Firebirds experience. In regards to the hostess Melissa. She ignored my son and I when we walked in and helped another gentleman and family as we patiently waited our turn even though we were there first. How sad, this place lacks first and lasting impression! We will be back but hopefully Pedro and Melissa will not be working and neglecting customers!",

We were so glad we did!  We got right in and seated, we had Leah as our server.  She was very good and had a great personality.  Hubby wanted crab cakes for an appetizer but was worried about  getting filled up before dinner.  When Leah came to see if we wanted an appetizer, I looked at hubby and Leah started teasing him about what he wanted.  He went for the crab cakes, which we would split.  They were awesome, the sauce drizzled over them and the garnish slaw was incredible!  We almost licked the plate!  Oh, and the bread - butt bread as she called it (it DOES look like a butt!) was AWESOME!!!  For my entree, I had to select the Bleu Cheese Filet, so many had reviewed them on Yelp and I wanted to find out for myself how good it was.  As my side, I got the parmesan potatoes.  Hubby got the prime rib with southwest au gratin potatoes.  My steak was cooked to perfection - I like it medium rare, more to the rare side.  FABULOUS!!  It melted in my mouth and the blue cheese melted on top, was to die for.  Hubby's prime rib was also cooked perfect, also medium rare.  Not a lot of fat, tender and juicy - YUMMY!!  My potatoes were OK, nothing special.  His were much better, cheesy with some kick!  He out ordered me in the side dishes.    For desert, which we took home, I selected the Key Lime Pie.  OMG....it was delicious!!!  Hubby chose the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  Another winner!!!  Every item we selected Leah told us were their best sellers.  I told her I had read several Yelp reviews and I had made my choices based on the rave reviews.  We were both very impressed and will definately go here again on our next special occasion.  It is expensive, but it was well worth it.  Nice atmosphere, GREAT food, pleasant staff, you can't really ask for more when you want a special dinner out.",

I called and even spoke to a manager to make a reservation for a large party of about 20 . made the reservation a while before the event . when I made it nothing else was asked of me other then my name and amount and time I had asked about their prime rib since I had read it was good and this was my whole reason for chosing this place they raved about it and mentioned nothing else. The day of the event I was approached by a different manager as we waited for our seat . he asked some small talk type of questions but then asked something that had me a bit confused, he asked if we had done or requested a particular menu. This had me worried and I knew something was gonna be up since no onenhad mentioned that to me. We got sat down and most of it was lovely the bread was good . they had two waitresses that took care of us that did a good job . but no one mentioned anything about menu items. Our reservation was a bit later but still several hours before they close. When it came time to order meals I ordered the prime rib I had been waiting for . only to find out they had ran out . at least 5 others in my party were also trying to order the prime rib and this was very upsetting that even when I was making a reservation and specifically asking about the prime rib did no one mention to me it was limited per day and would be out long before we arrived . or that there was an option to request a specific menu so maybe they could hold some for us ? Not sure how that would have worked cud no one explained it to me . but this experience which other wise should have been fine was ruined by this. The steak I did have was alright . not amazing but not what I had been craving for a month. The service its self was good for the large party we had the wait staff took care of us well. You do wait a little longer for things but its to be expected for a place like this. Just kinda put a bad taste I'm my mouth and could have been handled much better.",

    "text": "I was very impressed with Firebirds - not only with the food but with the service.   Service: Lauren A is an amazing waitress! Brought be a new lemonade before I had to ask and was on my last sip. Brought us ketchup before we could ask! Kept checking up on us from afar to see if we needed anything without needing to come over and interrupt the convo. Just perfect service - we were very impressed.   Food: we got the Durango burger and Market Salad. The tots that came with the Durango were the BEST!!! The burger was a cooked to well (ordered medium) but was still very delicious. The market salad did not come up short either. The chicken was moist which i've not found common when the chicken is in strips for salads. And I swapped the dressing for cilantro lime - I will be coming back for that. Light and not too vinegary.   We will be back soon to try dinner.",

    "text": "My personal favorites:  The fresh and crusty bread, served with real butter The house martini! $10.00 The ginger/mango mojito! $10.50 The aged rib-eye, comes in three sizes (I got the 14 ounce)--have it cooked rare to medium rare. Any more done than this I think is overcooking a perfectly fine steak. The 14-ounce ribeye was $26+  So, for the food I think it deserves a 4+ And for the atmosphere, a 5 easily. It's very nice and inviting inside, and none of that snooty ambiance and attitude that I have come to associate with some high-end steak restaurants that I've been to. Besides, there's A Nordstrom in the same area, as well as an Ethan Allen across from the restaurant.  I am not sure if the Firebirds is a chain and if it is, that would be my only quibble since I would very much prefer to go to smaller and local places.   All in all, my hubby and I had a very pleasurable dinner here, and we would go back for the ribeyes, of course!",

    "text": "Firebirds is a solid place to have lunch with coworkers or friends, albeit a tad on the pricey side.  My service has never been poor, and often been exceptional.  And there are several menu items I rotate through, so they're far from a one trick pony.  Their Delmonico Steak Sandwich was delightful from the first bite.  Juicy with char grilled flavors that cascaded over my tongue, I found this to be a very satisfying lunch option, especially when paired with the sweet potato fries... and for $12, not a bad price.  When my Grilled Tenderloin Salad arrived at the table, it was visually underwhelming, lacking the creativity I've grown accustomed to with other restaurants.  Essentially lettuce and tomato with some bleu cheese crumbles, with a steak on top.  Thankfully I had the foresight to add egg, which didn't really jazz it up all that much.  However, once I took a bite of that steak, I was completely impressed... with the taste.  At $15.95, it is pricey, but the meat is worth it.  The Bleu Cheese Burger is a must try for anyone who can appreciate mushrooms and roquefort.  A delight for the senses, my friend.  For my side, I went all-out Napoleon Dynamite and had the tots.  They were perfectly crisp... almost too crisp.  This was a completely enjoyable entree regardless.  And if none of these options appeals to you, check out their menu, which is modestly diverse.",

I told her it's hard to find a \"Cajun type chicken here in the USA\" for a Caesar.  I don't like the cold wet pink stuff.  (Yes, try and hold your laughter!).  She suggested their \"Rub\", and I was so amazed and loved it!  And they make their own creamy, garlicky dressing ...... and wait for it, their croutons are seasoned well!  Needless to say it was lovely.  For you spicy chicken ceasar lovers I suggest it.  (Note $8 Without chicken, add $7 with chicken).  Worth it.  My young mad had the kids wings (hot).  A little hot for him and he loves spice but overall with two side options a deal!  Enjoy.",

There's a lot of difference in the setting whether you sit inside or sit outside.  We made a huge mistake sitting on the patio.  It was well after the lunch hour but long before dinner hour too.  There are speakers on the patio playing music.  I'm thinking more for a happy hour effect.  However, it wasn't happy hour and all the guests on the patio were trying to talk over the music that was playing.  It was very loud and we even had to scoot ourselves in to hear the two of us at the same table.   Besides that we were fighting flies and received several bites -- mosquitos or some type of biting bug.  We definitely would never sit on the patio again.  Food sizes are huge and very good.   Cole slaw sauce is amazing.  Service was very good except for when we asked for our bill.  It took a while to get it and that's when we realized we had to get out of there before we got more bites.  Menu prices were a little spendy for salads, sandwiches and burgers but then, maybe we didn't get a lunch menu.",

Servers are professional and friendly. We told our server that it was our anniversary and she made it special by putting two candles on our dessert. I thought it was very sweet and thoughtful.   I love the interior too. Wood and beams with an inviting feel. The bar is awesome and makes you just want to hang out there for hours. I love all the glistening bottles on the wall.   On to the food: My husband's meal was OMG delicious! It was pasta with braised beef, spinach, cheese sauce with a hit of spicy. Comfort food at its finest. I had the filet kabob with roasted veggies and mashed potatoes. It was very good, but I should have been more adventurous in my selection. Like I said, my husbands dish was to die for.   Dessert was just as yummy as the meal. Try the crime brulee cheesecake!  So danged good.   As we were getting ready to leave, the manager stopped by to say hello. Nice touch! We will likely go back in a few months when family is in town. This is a special occasion place for us and we love it that way.",

We ordered burger sliders, plan, meat and grilled onions only.  After waiting a long time, they finally brought them but didn't omit the pickle or mustard.  Husband wouldn't touch them.  I ordered Clam Chowder and when it finally arrived, it had SOOOOOO much pepper and salt in it I couldn't taste the Chowder at all.  We like ordering, when the menu list it, steak and lobster, my husband gives me his lobster and I give him my steak.  It's a great way to indulge in our favorite food.  I ordered mashed potatoes and hubs a loaded baked potato.  Lobster was grilled and cooked to death not to mention the SALT.  Big disappointment.  Mashed potatoes were brown and chunky.  Like they had set from the morning.  Yuk! Steaks over seasoned as well but my husband was starving so need I say more?  We did order the Alex's Lemonade and that was the best thing we paid for.  Sorry Firebirds.....but paying 153.00 for a food I fed to my dogs doesn't bode well with us.",

But the pepper rubbed sirloin I had was really really good and my boyfriend got the delmonico because they ran out of the prime rib he lives for but this was a great replacement for him. That was probably the only downfall of our first time visiting since we chose this place for him to have the prime rib but it was a great experience our server Drake was great and I believe it was the manager that came to our table and told us about the prime rib that they usually keep a few pieces in case someone really wants the prime rib but he didn't get it bc of the temperature so he went for the delmonico since he loves rare steak. So for steak eaters it's a must try place (pricey so come for occasions) and there were some great seafood options for me but I figured I would try a steak and I was very satisfied.

Loved the quesadilla and coconut shrimp appetizers.  My baby back rib entree was ok- I've definitely had better, for example at Chop nearby.  My buddy had the ribeye, which was similarly just ok.  I've had the salmon in the past, and the burgers which were both pretty good.  Minus 1 star for just \"good\" food.  There used to be a majestic 340-class bull elk overlooking the main dining area- loved to see him when I visited.  Was told by the server that someone wrote a letter to corporate that they were offended by him, so they took him away.  Why do we let a small group of professional whiners diminish our lives like this?   Bring the elk out of storage- stand up for something.  When our table heard this we were all upset.  Not sure I'll be back until the elk returns.  The Elephant Bar is a good alternative.   Minus 1 star for letting the crybullies win.",

I knew my last less than stellar visit was a fluke and I was right.  This time, Firebird's lived up to my expectations and exceeded them.  We took my grandmother for her 86th birthday as she is also a fan.  We had a table for 8 people.  I am mad at myself for not remembering our servers name as I would love to give her kudos.  She got all 8 orders right and they were to perfection.  She had a great attitude and was super friendly.  Our food was  really good and the restaurant was clean.  All the things that were not right last time, we right on this time.  I am so happy that things are the way they should be!",

    "text": "Looking at the reviews, I should have been excited to go here. We went for a family birthday dinner, and it started out looking promising. I had been told that it was on the level of the Keg, which I love. But then I got a laminated menu like I was at a diner, and my opinion started to change. Their menu was quite limited - for example: I think there were only 2 \"side\" items that weren't potato. But despite the small variety of choices, I chose a rib-eye steak, which I love, even at lower priced venues such as Texas Roadhouse. I also got a salad to start. My husband ordered the steak Delmonico and a salad to start. My father in law and brother in law ordered the same dish, a medium Filet.   Three of us ordered salads, and even though they had good flavor, they were completely overdressed. My salad which was just a mixed green salad was chopped in such a way that it was very very difficult to eat. It wasn't large enough to stab with my fork, or scoop up either.   There were seven of us at the table, and when our food did come out, they had a lot of difficulty figuring out who got what dish. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but it did kind of kill the mood as far as \"here's your food, let's eat!\" The other confusion came from the fact that my husband and I had the exact same cut of meat - both medium well rib-eyes. Despite the fact that I had ordered Medium rare, and he had ordered a medium rare Delmonico. (and yes, I know that there is differences in thought about what that is, but it should have not been the same cut as mine) My father in law had a nicely medium filet, but my brother in law's was medium rare. So out of 4 steaks, they only cooked one correctly. At a steak house, I would NOT expect 75% of the steak to be the incorrect temp!  Not everyone was disappointed. My mother-in-law liked her salmon (after she was told that they didn't have her first fish of choice), and my sister in law enjoyed her trout.  And of course my father in law enjoyed his correctly cooked steak.   None of us sent our food back, as it was edible, but I know that after this experience, I will not be back. This place was too high priced to be this disappointing. There are many other restaurants within walking distance that are much much better, and personally, I would much rather have a cheap steak at Texas Roadhouse where I can have a large variety of choices for sides, as I know that it will be the correct temp. If I'm looking for something high priced and delicious, it will be the Keg or Flemings - definitely not here.",

First, my party and I went to this restaurant for Happy Hour and was told that there was not enough room for us to indulge in the Happy Hour festivities as only those sitting in the bar and patio area were privy and both aforementioned areas were full. We then managed to talk to the manager and sit at a regular booth and enjoy Happy Hour drinks and food. The first drink given to our table was supposed to be a Jack's Honey Peach Tea, but upon receiving the drink, it should have been called Pink Sludge. The drink was full of clumps of an unknown sticky substance. The waiter's two explanations was that it could have been either fruit pulp or egg whites in the cocktail. The drink's description did not mentioned fruit pulp or egg whites. So, with that being said, there has to be a problem with cleanliness. The food was mediocre at best. I will say the waiter was very charismatic and took care of my party and I. As a result of this experience I ended up with food poisoning and multiple trips to the toilet to throw up. I would not recommend Firebirds after this experience, unfortunately.",

That and a loaded baked potato. One of the others in our party ordered the filet, medium well. The steaks arrived, and I was really looking forward to it, after the terrific salad...cut into it...hmm...kind of overdone...tried the other side...medium well... My friend's filet was beautifully rare. Neither of us were very happy about it.   I feel guilty sending overcooked steaks back (hey, the cow gave it's all for the steak - don't throw it away) - good thing I got the chile rub - that made it acceptable.  Really disappointed - had the steak been cooked the way I ordered it, this would've gotten 5 stars.  :-(",

I think other server beside our assigned server was more helpful than her. She would often forget things, my glass of coke stayed empty for a while, just seemed overwhelmed and tend to not care about us on the patio. Other servers were nice.  Food.... I had blue cheese filet with loaded baked potato. Since they coated potato with so much salt, every time potato shifts on my plate, excess salt will get on steak, making my food overly salty. filet mignon was okay, had better cut. Blue cheese was nice, unfortunately it just got too salty from baked potato, I just couldn't eat anymore. Complimentary bread was actually very tasty.   Nice ambiance, located near the Chandler mall, perhaps I visited during their off day, but based on my first visit, this place will not be my first choice of restaurant to eat again as there are so many options nearby.",

I went twice in the past two weeks and True to form. Unbeknownst to there wait staff we requested sweet potato fries ( taken off the menu) and we received. So after a less pleasant review the first time ,they listened ! It was overboard listening to there customers that make this place \"AGAIN\" our favorite steak house!!!    We left several hundred bucks there Friday night so I guess it is wise to listen :)  If there was anything negative, it was my chocolate martini x 2 when I picked them up at the bar, I looked at the man who made them and smiled and raised my eyebrow as the pineapple tinies were full, opposed to the chocolate martini which was nearly 3/4 from the top ( the widest part ) and it looked obviously odd.   He understood me without me having muttered a word he said thats a five oz martini glass and said if you think I am going to fill it, your wrong. Several guest sitting at the bar said dang!!    Not the best response!   But all in all everything else was great :)  The food and service was great !! We got the sweet potato fries the next day after church with our burgers !  YUM !!",

The table was cleared quickly after each dish. Food was prompt and never had to wait around.  I had the rib eye, which was cooked well and great flavor. The grilled shrimp with chile was delicious. Salad and bread were good too.  An overall nice dining experience. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

She says that it was god, but it would be nicer if it came with sides so it's just not a steak. Also the kid menu was also very good too. My sisters say that it's really yummy! The only thing was that the Mac and cheese side was much larger than her Mahi meal. Overall this warm restaurant was delicious,just had a few problems!",

I called a florist to deliver flowers to Firebirds they were more than happy to take them and keep them in a cooler nice and fresh for our dinner table. One of the things that impressed me the most was I called in a half hour before our reservation and asked if they were serving prime rib I spoke to a woman named Molly and she told me yes they did. When we arrived at 7 o'clock sharp and asked about our reservations we were swiftly seated to a VIP table with our flowers beautifully sitting on it. We were attended to immediately and after viewing the menu I decided on some prime rib and lobster with a loaded baked potato and mixed vegetables while my wife ordered the filet mignon and Parmesan mashed potatoes with port mushrooms. Now here's where it gets good they informed me they were out of prime rib bummer that is why I came, then they came back and told me Molly had saved a piece of prime rib for me thinking that I may order it,does anybody do that nowadays what a thoughtful young lady I was so impressed. Anyhow the prime rib was giant and delicious,loaded baked potato quality good ,lobster tail was just what you would expect very good. My wife's fillet mignon melted in her mouth and the Parmesan baked potatoes were also very good, port mushrooms and mixed vegetables were delicious and our whole dining experience was brought together with a beautiful piece of big daddy lemon cake on a plate that said happy anniversary spelled out in different flavors which me and my wife enjoyed immensely thank you so much Firebirds for making my 35th anniversary one I will never forget we will be back for our 36th. Thanks again everyone that served us and made sure everything that was all right I believe our server was Cory she was very nice and attended to us often .David the manager also came over to make sure everything was all right.thanks again Firebirds for All that you did for us",

    "text": "I've dined at Firebirds twice, both on a Saturday afternoon (before 6pm).  My first time was exceptional.  It was a double date night.  We've heard so much about their smoked wings and the steak so that's exactly what we had out hearts on trying.  We all started with wedge salads and the Firebirds signature salads.  They were crazy good!  We moved on to the smoked chicken wings for an appetizer.  They were as good as everyone made them out to be.  Smoked to perfection!    The cuts of steaks were pretty big so my date and I shared an entree.  A filet mignon, loaded baked potato and asparagus (I think ... I'm almost for sure).  Everything was out of this world good!  No issues, no complaints! This was about a year ago.  Fast forward to about 3 months ago I dined at Firebirds again ... this time with a large party (10, including kids).  The dining experience wasn't nearly as nice as it was when I went on a date night.  When I dined with the large party 3 months ago we were neglected.  Our meals all came out at different times and took forever.  This time I ordered salmon, my friend ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Pass on it!  Pass on the meatloaf!  It was salty, kinda dry, the green beans were hard.  They could have been steamed a little longer.    Because I had such a good dining experience the first go 'round, I'm definitely going to try it again solo or on a date night.  Definitely not as a group!",

Deviled eggs were good and the wedge salad was really nice, other than that this place is pretty meh.   The bread may have been the high point.  My medium burger was ridiculously over well done, the manager and my waiter were quick to discount it which was nice, but it's $14 and better at 5 guys.  The $50 surf and turf was average, the tuna salad was nice, but the lobster dip was Applebee's quality.  The key lime is really really lovely, but the brownie and ice cream was terrible.  The service from our waiter was memorable in a good way.  To me, I'd say there are places in this price range with much higher standards for the quality of food they put out, so we will likely not return.",

The fish was quite amazing, but I couldn't remember what I'd had so I opted for the Aspen Sirloin & baked potato. My mom got the strawberry & shrimp salad to share at our table of 8. I honestly could've just eaten the salad itself (and a potato). My steak was amazing, but I just wasn't feeling it, I just wanted more salad!  We had reservations to sit outside but by the time that rolled around, the wind picked up and we knew it would be unbearable to sit outside... so our hostess got another inside table immediately for us. I felt bad for our intended server but she completely understood.",

Given proximity to my office, people choose it fairly often for work events, but I can't really say I have had anything that is really memorable and I like.   The lobster spinach dip is ok - in my opinion kind of bland. It's runny, and not super cheesy, looks like it was scooped out of a crock pot. There is very little lobster in it.  The crab cakes as well - just bland. Nothing to be excited about. There are 2 crab cakes and mountains of this ridiculous slaw.  The chicken quesadillas are, well, where's the cheese?   The tenderloin salad, well, the meat was burnt tasting.   I did have the tortilla soup once, and that was pretty good. The spinach salad that I also ordered was - just boring. I guess what I would say is this really is like an over-priced Applebees.   The Smokehouse Chicken sandwich was super dry the time I got it, and well, I guess I expect something with \"smokehouse\" in the name to be smoked - suffice to say it is not.  I can't say that it is \"bad\", because it's not. It's just average. The service is pretty good..oh wait, and if you get the bread - that is pretty dang amazing. I highly recommend that. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Overall, I won't be going here by my own choice.",

My salad was brought out after my sandwich so I didn't want to bother with it and let my food get cold. I asked the waitress to box it to go. She said she would box a new salad and put the dressing on the side so it wouldn't wilt the lettuce. The sandwich was terrible. There was seemingly no seasoning at all on the meat. It was really chewy and unpleasant in texture. The au jus was totally flavorless. Massive fail. After leaving I noticed that there was no dressing packed for my salad. Talk about a disappointing lunch outing. We wasted almost 2 hours at this place and it was not worth the time or money.",

The carrot cake was some of the best I have ever had in my life and our table also ordered the cheesecake, which was above average. If I must be constructive, the steak fries were average to below average for the price point and overall, I felt certain areas of the restaurant, like the bathroom, could use a bit of updating, but don't let those two areas keep you away. The pros easily out way the cons. Regarding our service, it was amazing!",

    "text": "Here with my two daughters for Valentine's Day. The restaurant is about 60% full. Not very bustling for the \"most romantic night of the year\". First time here and I like the interior. It's like a nice upscale cabin. Very classy lumberjack.  My daughters ordered off the kids' menu (chicken strips and hamburger). Their meals look excellent for being kids' meals. They both got two sides (fresh veggies and fresh fruit, but could've chosen fries, green beans, Mac & cheese, or parmesean mashed potatoes). The burger looks good quality and chicken strips came with honey mustard and were delicious. Yes, I tried them. It was came with a small two cookie pack of Oreos.  I ordered a medium rare aged 14oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato. The loaded potato looked exactly like the one at Texas Roadhouse. I'm not opposed to that, but for $6 less, I could've gotten a bigger ribeye and the same potato. The ribeye was overcooked, on the latter end of the medium well side. Almost well done. Very little pink. Decent seasoning, but dry and chewy.  The service was very lacking. Our waitress was so hard to get ahold of that the burger went ketchup-less and my iced tea went sugar-free for about half of our meal. BUT, she was nice and apologetic and at least seemed genuine about it. Not sure why we were ignored though. 2.76489 stars but I'll round up to 3",

    "text": "First time visit. It was a toss up between here and the Elephant Bar next door and at least on the Internet the menu looked way more appetizing from the Firebird.   Monday at 5pm so no wait. Menu is pretty simple but classy. You can still get anything from a salad or burger to a nice slab of prime rib or lobster tail. The decor was warm and inviting with high ceilings brown tones of a hillside hunting lodge; down to the 6x6 bull elk mounted on the wall.   Jen ordered a salad and I added the quesadilla and onion rings for appetizers. I am a huge fan of battered apps not breaded. The onion rings here are battered but very lightly then coated with some panko breading. New to me as I am set in my beer battered ways, but very very good. The quesadilla was decent but since I am not a fan of mushy black beans which in this case were an ingredient, I wasn't in awe but figured it want horrible. Another positive is they have the really good creamy ranch not the knock off crap.   Next up was the prime rib. I was really torn from what I wanted going back and forth amongst the lobster and bacon wrapped filet, the prime rib, or a plain ribeye. They have literally, an actual wood fire grill which I love and almost mandates you order at least something from the grill.   Both mine and Jen's prime rib was cooked perfectly and oh so tender. She was mostly full already so barely touched her green beans but agreed the prime was delish! My side was seasoned steak fries which were as awesome as we all hope they will be when we order them.   The highlight was our server Pedro. Perfect timing, very polite, non-intrusive, and silent service when applicable. I preached silent service for twenty years to my staff advising you don't need to interrupt the guests constantly. Its priceless and oblivious to most servers and guests. Loved this place.",

There were no descriptions...  2) So I got some of their fire shrimp, it was DISGUSTING! I figured they would put the sauce on the side, nope, they tossed those shrimp in sauce like wings. This MIGHT have been okay, but the sauce was a cheap mayo/sriracha sauce - every shrimp I ate felt like I was eating a spoonful of mayo - absolutely low-class stuff.  3) The Philly Egg rolls - once again, terrible. Don't know how you can mess up a philly cheesesteak but they did. AND AGAIN with the sauce, they covered the egg rolls with some disgusting sauce. How tacky - put the sauce on the side or let someone know if you're going to toss their egg rolls in a sauce.  4) The steak medallions were cooked good, but they were served with some strange and odd-tasting quesadillas.   I sound like I am a picky eater writing this post, but I'm not I promise. The food just seemed so tacky - like something I would get at a hole-in-the-wall bar. So disappointing that out of several different dishes the only thing I could find even somewhat not weird-and-gross is a tiny little steak medallion....",

The atmosphere was swanky with dimmed lighting. The aroma of the wood burning fire really set the stage for what I was about to eat. There was a pretty good size bar inside the entrance with a large dining room with tables and large spacious booths about. Large windows allow for gazing out towards the palm trees and mall parking lot offering a wide array of shopping options before or after dining. The service was as expected. Timely and attentive. Granted it wasn't busy so I couldn't assess a True service level when it was slow. The menu offered a variety of steak and seafood options. Along with salads, sandwiches, and burgers. Great flavors and quality food albeit I believe to be a chain. Overall, nice place to go that's not fine dining and a place that you can remain casual with a relaxing atmosphere.",

The young man in the pink shirt brought us to a very small pedestal like table with a black tablecloth on it  there were two other vacant 4 tops empty and available at that time  we asked him why he was sitting us at this little tiny table ?  he shrugged his shoulders so we sat down  we ate our dinner at this little tiny table for 1.  we could not fit all our food on this table  By the time we had the salad and appetizer there was no room for the  bread board.  We were having to put things up on top of the brick pillar post.  There is/was NO reason for seating us at this poor excuse for a table when other couples right next to us were all sitting at 4 tops   Pretty much ruined Valentine's Day dinner and by the time you, the manager came by, it was too late to do anything  we were already done eating  Don't you ever do that to anyone at your restaurant again!  the fact that this happened on Valentine's Day with tables available (which by the way no one ever said at the entire time we were there)   I used to love coming to Firebirds but why were we singled out and treated this way ?  it was clear it was a ridiculous table and he should've automatically known to put us at a four top rather than shrugged his shoulders as if to say oh well  Unacceptable and we were literally the only ones in your restaurant that were treated this way.  I trust you'll do something for us so as not to lose us but also anyone we might have sent your way. Once again no reason this should have happened to us on our 30th  Valentine's Day anniversary.  The server was aware it was not only Valentine's Day but our 30th anniversary we were not even offered a lousy dessert  we had to buy it We're extremely disappointed and look forward to hearing back from you  James & Laura Plourde",

I made reservations online for this past Friday evening at 5:30 p.m.  We arrived on time and checked in with the seating hostess.  We waited less than 3 minutes to be seated!  Our waitress greeted us and asked how we were doing.  She did not rush the conversation and seemed genuinely interested in us.  She thoroughly explained the specials for the evening, gave us our menus and allowed us time to make our selections.  During this time the Manager stopped by our table to chat and we watched him introduce himself to every table in our area!  The waitress soon returned to take our orders.  We waited about 15 minutes for the fresh bread to arrive and our meals arrived promptly thereafter.    I must say that the food was divine!  We ate with another couple and all ordered the prime rib with different sides, while I ordered the Filet Mignon.  The food was cooked to perfection, each plate as ordered.  Before our dinner was over, the manager visited our table again (as well as others) and asked how we enjoyed our dinner and if we had any suggestions for him.    This experience was very different than our last dining experience in May.  So glad to see the Management on top of things!  We will definitely be back and recommend to our friends!",

So cold that the butter wouldn't even melt over the top of the side dish.  It's always something at this restaurant.  I found my prime rib very tough and flavorless even with the au jus. On the positive side, the horseradish sauce was quite good and the service was excellent.    This used to be one of our favorite restaurants but sadly no more.  My experience last night mirrors that of April P's December 7 review.  Something is going on here --- it's problems at the kitchen level, not the service level.",

We ordered the aged rib eye and the salmon.  The ribeye was ordered medium rare with a char.  Although edible, the steak was tough and chewy as if it wasn't a good cut.  Honestly a place like Applebee's would be similar.  Not the place to order a steak.  The salmon- the same.  Edible but little fishy and not the clean flaky flavorful taste you would expect from a wood plank cooked salmon.  I will day that the side of mushrooms was really good!  Save this place for a happy hour.  For a good steak or salmon meal- skip this spot and go to a place that will impress you.  I won't be going back here that's for sure.",

    "text": "We usually go to The Keg for our steaks, but I kept hearing great things about this place so we decided to try it for my birthday:   Pros: Nice restaurant and decor. Our waitress, Ashley, was very good. The bread, lobster queso, and loaded baked potato were very good. The dessert they brought me for my birthday was beautiful and delicious.   Cons: Our reservation was for 5:15 pm, but they did not have our table ready and did not seat us until 5:30 pm. When I make reservations at The Keg, we never wait, we go right in. Where they seated us was dark and my elderly parents could not see the menu, etc. very well, and they could not lighten the area for us. The restaurant was a little loud with music playing overhead so it was hard for us to hold a conversation. In the lobby area they have wood stacked on both sides and we felt they could use that area for seating while people wait for their table instead of having to stand; my elderly parents had nowhere to sit while we waited for our table to be ready. We had been told the steaks here were better than The Keg so we, my husband and I, ordered the 14 oz ribeye steaks. We always order the ribeye at The Keg. I ordered mine Medium Well, which is supposed to be pink, but not bloody. The steaks were small and thin, like a breakfast steak, and mine was very over done, no pink and tough to cut and chew. Needless to say, we were disappointed in the steaks.   For a steak, I will stick with The Keg, but I would return here for a burger or something like that.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I begged & bribed his family to come here instead of the normal steakhouse they go to for birthdays. We love the Arrowhead location, and expected this location to be up to standard.      Service was good. Other than the table not being completely prebussed/crumbed, no major complaints. Our drinks were always full and food came in a timely manner.     All 5 of our filet mignon were underdone. The medium rare steaks came out rare, and my medium steak came out medium rare. We aren't sending back 5 steaks. Ive been in the industry for 9 years, I'd rather eat an underdone steak than send it back.     I start to get into my steak, and I realize that it is unbelievably charred, which I normally don't mind. Im pretty used to eating burned food, considering my cooking skills. The char is so bad that I can't taste the steak at all. I am pretty sure there was no salt put on the steak before it was cooked.    The steak had me puzzled. About 5 bites in I realize that it isn't filet mignon. My suspicion is validated when I steal a bite of my boyfriends steak. Everyone else's filet is wrapped in bacon, mine is not.     I had to be at work later that day, and was already short on time. I did not have the option to wait for another steak to be cooked. Also did not want to cause a scene in front of my boyfriends parents. As someone who will do whatever possible to avoid sending anything back, I would have sent back this steak if I had the time to.     Also, several of the Au Gratin potatoes in the mix were still raw. Super unpleasant to be picking raw potatoes out of a mouth full of chewed food. Also super unpleasant to eat said raw potatoes.    I don't eat fish, so I can't tell you how the ahi was.  (Ahi? Mahi? Not even sure if I'm saying it right) However, I overheard my boyfriends dad saying he liked the salad better than the fish. No ahi went uneaten though!    The creme brulee cheesecake is great as always. Having worked at several bars/restaurants, I did find it odd that they did not have one of the desserts comp'ed for a birthday.     When presented the bill, I noticed that I was charged for the 9oz filet that I ordered but instead got something of lower quality and price. My boyfriend was super pissed, and told me to tell our server to charge me for what I was given (probably a sirloin, no salt/pepper, extra char lol). I could tell it caught our server off guard since everything seemed fine. She ended up comping the entire steak. Which was cool of her, because even though I do like sirloin nornally, this steak was SO bad.     Overall, service was great, food was terrible. I would not go back here. It was kind of embarrassing since we talked up the place so much. The whole time I was wishing they came to our side of town and had dinner at \"our\" firebirds (Arrowhead)",

    "text": "Today, October 03, 2012 my wife and I had lunch here again. In AZ, there are not many Firebirds Restaurants. Therefore we enjoy dining here when in the area. It's unlike many other Restaurants. The food and service is always very good. I consider a cooked to order meal for two costing $27.46+ tip as low cost/cheap! When you add up all the extras at a fast food stand (I will not refer to those as restaurants) the final cost will hit this mark. So why settle for kept warm fast food?  Today, my wife ordered a med cooked Blue Cheese Burger with Sweet Potato fries. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich as it's the best one around. The burger arrived as ordered. My sandwich also arrived as ordered and was filling.   Leah was our waitress and did a great job! I ordered diet coke and she served refills without hunting her down-great! The Restaurant Manager on duty visited our table to check on our meal. That's a sign of great customer service. We high recommend Firebirds and will dine here again!",

Our food which was basically 2 sets of three sliders, fish tacos and pretzels took 35 minutes to arrive and this was just appetizer food.  The food was ok. Nothing great. I wouldn't expect much from app food to be honest so I can't knock them for that.  It seemed everyone's food was slow and that everyone had complaints.",

    "text": "For a while after I discontinued being a vegetarian due to anemia, it took me a while to become accustomed to eating any type of meat again, but this was especially so for red meat. I would crave a steak though (once in a long while) and where would I venture to? Firebirds, of course! I've been here countless times and the service I receive is always top-notch. Servers are always knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance is a bit more on the intimate side: lighting is definitely low. We usually order bottles of wine when we come here. My dad usually takes care of that though, but always ask your server! They are quite knowledgeable about their wines, as well.  So okay I had one mishap here once. We had a man serving us and I can't recall his name (this was post-veg) but I remember him being so sarcastic and rude about me ordering my steak not medium or even less cooked. Sorry, I'm eating it. I'm also paying for it. So if you have a problem with that, you obviously have way too much time on your hands and need to invest it into something else besides trying to facilitate what I am consuming.   Anyways, besides that, generally everything goes well here and I never saw that server again so maybe he isn't around anymore. :)   Oh. Order the brownie. I know you'll be stuffed after your phenomenal steak with potatoes, but this brownie is truly to die for.",

We went here for my birthday and I had the filet medallions with a wine portobello sauce with a green Chiles mac and cheese...OMG freaking DELISH and worth every damn dime. My boyfriend got the prime rib and swore it was the best he ever had.   When the manager stopped over we ranted and raved about our server, Michael and how awesome our meal was and she offered us a free dessert.  When my boyfriend told the manger it was my birthday...my dessert came with a candle and the server created a card with highlighter markers and had all the staff sign the card....This place is one of my favorites but tonight showed me they ROCK!

The hotel staff dropped me off and picked me up, which was nice because I did not rent a car as I was travelling with a co-worker.

One draft beer, one diamond cocktail  (pineapple based) and one margarita later we were ready to order a second round and some appetizers. JR ordered the beef sliders with parmesan garlic fries, Ron got chicken tenders buffalo style with the parm/garlic fries and l got the shrimp appetizer.  The boys liked their food. JR thought the beef sliders were over-done, thus dry. Ron enjoyed his chicken tenders.  Chicken tenders are made ready to please most guests as it wasn't spicy  (Rom prefers spicier flavors). My shrimp was not my fav because it was smothered in warm thousand island mayo.  By 5:300ish, the house was packed, patio filled up, it is definitely a popular joint!  I give very high marks to the waitresses who attended to our table, they are outstanding, personable and we couldn't have asked for better service!  Food is in my view very average 2.5 to 3.0.  Beverages were very tasty.  Atmosphere is very inviting, comfortable, a very nice hang out at the end of the day, say... Friday, TGIF!  I can't review their dinner menu at this point but l hope it is better than their happy hour menu.",

The fried spinach is like kale chips- a bit oily, but delicious. I've had better mashed potatoes though- they weren't as creamy as I like them to be. Service is kind and attentive. It can be a bit loud during typical dinner hours (busy!). I want to come back and try one of their steaks next time!",

Great customer service but they could calm down a bit with interrupting conversation. Makes me wonder if they're not trying to rush you off. I still give it 5 stars. One of my favorites for special occasions.",

The burgers are tasty; I've had those a few times. All the appetizers I've ever tried were good. And, the BLT Salad is phenomenal--a must try. They even give you fresh-baked bread while you wait for your meal. The staff is friendly and professional. The decor is nice, with a rich, dark interior. The patio is even better--especially during our mild months. Overall, I'm a fan. I'd recommend Firebirds to anyone.",

The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is that they forgot to bring us our crab cakes for our appetizer until we mentioned it when they brought the meal out. They gave us the crab cakes on the house and apologized. Then when we asked for our leftovers in a box they threw my wife's leftovers away by mistake and only gave me my leftovers. It was especially bad because wife had a large pasta dish that she ate maybe 25% of, but she enjoyed it so it was annoying when it all got thrown away.

    "text": "My quick summary: Fabulous dining for any reason.  My fiance and I usually go here in the evenings for date nights.  But yesterday my 10 coworkers and I went her for a work lunch.  I was amazed at how smoothly the service went for 11 people.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food was amazing, as always.  Since I've dined here before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, I'll just go ahead and tell you about all the food, versus just what I ate yesterday.  They start you out with loaves of fresh baked bread and butter.  The crust is crispy, perfect, divine & I have no idea how they accomplish that.  I wish my baking experiments came out that well.  They were more than willing to bring out many, many loaves for the carb addicted hordes at our table.  The appetizers the table shared as a group were the lobster spinach dip, smoked chicken wings, and onion rings.  I, myself, have only tried the lobster spinach dip.  It is hands down the best I have ever had.  It has just the right about of lobster so that you actually can get a bit in every bite.  I did not get to try the onion rings or wings, but they looked amazing.  There was no excess oil or anything to make either appetizer looks slightly soggy.  Everyone raved about how wonderful & perfectly cooked everything was.  I got to sit in watch in extreme envy.  Woo boy.  For my entree I had the Aspen sirloin and loaded baked potato.  I ordered my steak medium rare, and shockingly, it was a True medium rare.  Most places overcook it and bring out a medium.  Not Firebird's.  And it was so juicy and delicious.  The baked potato was also amazing.  My only complaint was that they outside was pretty salty.  But, unlike most people, I am not a huge salt person.  I like spicier and/or other flavors, not so much salty ones.  So I chalk this up to my own personal taste.  It had bacon, chives, sour cream, cheese, all the goodies.  I also have to rave about their pecan crusted trout with peach salsa that I've has before.  I'm not usually a fish person, but I am a salsa person so it caught my eye.  And I ate every bite.  That fish & salsa is addictingly good.  The group ordered an array of dessert combos and there was no complaints from anyone.  They even brought one friend a small bowl of vanilla ice cream because she wasn't hungry enough to eat a real dessert, the wimp.  Best of all, the service was continuously prompt.  Our waitress checked on us every couple of minutes for drinks, etc.  And they delivered all our dishes within moment of each others, so no one was watching other people eat, etc.  Can't wait to go back again!",

This has turned into one of our favorate places to go.  The food is consistently good.  By signing up to receive emails, we've gotten coupons for appetizers, desserts, and discounts.   Someone else mentioned s/he wasn't a fan of open kitchens.  However, we do like that arrangement.  It's far enough away to not be intrusive.  The bar has a fireplace that's nice to sit by on chilly days.    The fresh-baked sourdough bread is among the best served by any restaurant. The coconut shrimp appetizer was big enough for a meal, and the grilled tenderloin salad enough for a male friend of ours.  For dessert, I'm not usually a fan of brownies, but the salted caramel sauce added just the right touch.",

    "text": "This is one of my most favorite restaurants. Each time I have gone, the food and service has been great. Their bread is probably one of the best bread loaves I have ever had and I can make a meal out of that and that alone. Freshly baked and slightly doughy still, its magnificent. When I first started going to Firebirds, I would order the pork tenderloin with a sweet and sour glaze and the southwest au gratin potatoes. Sooooo good. Now its no longer on the menu   :(   Anyways, I have found a replacement in the grilled salmon with veggies and Parmesan mashed potatoes.I always ask for peach salsa on the side too to put on the fish. It is honestly one of the best salmon meals I have ever had at any restaurant and surprisingly, one of the healthiest items at Firebirds. I love that they list their nutrition facts on their website. Anyways, my husband loves the prime rib and loaded baked potato. He says that the prime rib is consistently good and flavored really well. Also, Firebirds has some awesome wings for appetizers and their tortilla slaw with coconut shrimp appetizer is to die for. The slaw is so different but very tasty. Oh and for dessert, their key lime pie and brownie sundae are pretty legit. There are only a couple of things that I have tried that I was not overly impressed with: Tortilla soup (creamier than I like and not much flavor), pecan crusted trout was kinda dry.  The service at Firebirds has always been great. There was one time when my salmon was raw in the middle. The waitress took it away and continuously apologized. A manager came over and offered to give me any appetizer and as much bread as I wanted at no charge while I waited for my meal to be recooked. They also gave me dessert on the house. The managers as well as their staff genuinely care about the customers it seems which is something I haven't seen in a long time at other restaurants. Their prices are also decent. I personally thought the prices, service, and quality of food at Firebirds far surpassed The Keg. My husband and I will definitely continue to come to this restaurant over places like the Keg and more upscale steakhouses!",

    "text": "Firebirds, how I love thee? You deliver the perfect piece of meat everytime - whether prime rib, sirloin or ribeye. Because of this, I don't even know what other proteins you serve, nor do I care. You always have room for me to sit near the grill where the smell is devine. Your wait staff is well-informed and happy to be at their job. But surprisingly, my favorite thing about you is your loaded baked potato! I'm not sure how the skin is so crisp and salty, and the toppings more fresh and mouth-watering than your steak. Yes, you are expensive and I do not care for your fat-ridden del Monaco. But we should love our favorites unconditionally.",

The bar was filthy dirty and she did not clean up after customers and we waited a long time only to get cold food.  The place was not busy as it was only 4pm - absolutely no excuse.  If she is a \"corp trainer\" then they are in trouble !!!",

I got the durango, which I was expecting to have a kick, with the chilies and pepper jack cheese... but they forgot the chilies and you couldn't really taste the cheese at all. The portion of fries was truly delicious, just wish there were more then 8 fries. Coleslaw was very dry... Skip it. The bread they bring is amazing, we definitely asked for seconds. My boyfriend had the French dip and ate every last bite. My aunt had the spinach salad and it was huge and delicious. The wait staff was excellent, the hostess was adorable and very sweet. Our waitress was talkative and helpful without being over bearing or pushy, and the chocolate brownie is a for sure thing... Especially when dipped in the sea salt caramel. The staff and the dessert almost pushed me to 4 stars... But the portions and the prices were a little too gourmet for this American grill.",

    "text": "We visited Firebirds for the first time yesterday, and had a wonderful experience. We dined midday between the lunch and dinner crowds and enjoyed a quiet meal in a fairly empty venue. It smells delicious inside! I wonder if they pipe in that smoky smell or if it's truly wafting from that kitchen? The interior is well appointed, clean, and shows pride in this franchise. I ordered the Surf & Turf (which I was CRAVING) with the BLT salad, and stole more than my fair share of crisp, mouthwatering tater tots from my husband's plate. The filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and melted in my mouth. It's bacon-wrapped with light seasoning that doesn't distract from the natural flavor of the cut. The lobster tail is substantial in size - more than expected - tender, not overly seasoned, and had a slightly smoked flavor. Our young server Lulu was attentive, offered helpful suggestions, and was quite patient & accommodating as we made a multitude of substitutions when we ordered due to dietary considerations. Our glasses were never empty and every request was met with gracious politeness. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu which offers a variety of selections without becoming overwhelming. The GM stopped by our table to chat - which is always a nice touch. We will definitely come back next time I crave Surf & Turf. It was well priced at around $40 and worth every penny.",

    "text": "We chose Firebirds to celebrate my birthday and were comfortably seated within the nice cool interiors plushly cushioned booth seating during happy hour.  The waiter informed us to take advantage of happy hour drinks and menu we would have to move to outside patio seating (this obviously to show passing vehicle traffic that the place had diners so this was a Firebirds profit decision at diner's expense).  The bare metal chairs soon became uncomfortable and with no overhead fans, misters or a breeze we were sweating and had to talk over the sounds of passing vehicle traffic.  The Coors Light tap having been on the fritz for 2 days I ordered champagne & consumed the small glass while awaiting dinner and ordered a 2nd glass prior to the meal arriving.  The food came and our waiter failed to reappear (I assume he was distracted serving his more important inside non-happy hour customers) until we'd finished eating so the entire meal with no drink.  Soon the flies found us and were swarming all over everything then an unsmiling businesslike manager came with a much too lengthy explanation about the beer problem and blamed the outside seating requirement in the computer.  The waiter was inattentive, drinks not available and uncomfortable seating policy.  To their credit not only was the bill forgiven but we received a $50.00 gift certificate to get us back but I doubt anything will change internally!",

    "text": "So my wife daughter and son went to Firebirds with moderate expectations. It was about 2pm when we arrived. The hostess was on the phone and with a smile puts one finger in the air and puts her head back down. A manager comes behind her (she makes sure not to make eye contact with any of us) then turns around. Three other serves (who had nothing in their hands) walked right passed us. I said to myself \"Hmmm... I hope the food isn't as bad as the hospitality.\" After standing and staring at the hostess for about six more minutes...we were seated. Our server...forget her name...was genuine in her service. That's about all I can say. She forgot our Caesar salad (which is pretty bland) but the croutons are ok. I ordered the Aspen Sirloin mid-rare. Texture reminded me of those stretchy hands n feet you used to get out of those little quarter machines back in the day and it tasted nothing like beef...straight salt. So I reordered the Filet Mignon. Now...I understand that it was on the fly...but there's no reason the center of the filet should be under 75degrees. NONE. The center was cold...I mean COLD.  By this point I'm starved and just ask for two minutes on each side. So the manager (yes the same from earlier) drops off my plate and it's clearly obvious she hates her job and shouldn't be there...especially in a management capacity. So after getting my medium steak back...it was wrapped with a nasty, slimy attempt at bacon. I'd give the steak itself (everything else aside) a 4.5. I ask for a glass of malbec and the waitress looks at me with this perplexed look and goes...\"Ummm...what's that?\". LMFAO!!! I'm sorry you're in steakhouse and the waiter doesn't know a red wine when she hears it????  So after its all said and done my bill is presented. No GC, no taking care of my daughters plate, glass of wine...nothing. I'm NOT a moocher! By Any means. But being in the industry...I KNOW I WOULD NEVER EVER place an untouched bill in front of my guests who had the experience I had. Even if offered, I would have probably turned it down...but it's the principle. Show that you value your guests...they don't. Pitiful management going on there. Nothing special about the place.  If you love commercial food, and don't really care about wasting your dollar...then this place is perfect for you. OH..in there defense the Salmon my wife ordered was pretty darn good and the sauce was well made. Hence the 2nd star. Had it not been for that, and like I said our genuine server (whom I left $20 on an $84 lunch)...I would take away a couple stars. NEVER going back.",

Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She didnt hover but kept to a timely check in. Okay, so... I don't even know where to begin to even start explaining the immense deliciousness that was their seasonal goat cheese fondue. It didn't sound appetizing to me in the slightest but I decided, \"What the h*ll, I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time,\" and with that we ordered (highly recommend pairing with a red wine). It arrived to the table nice and bubbling hot. There were sprouts and tomatoes on top, which you wouldn't think would go together but they totally belong together like in a unrealistic Disney Happily Ever After kind of way. I was so happy we ordered it and sadder to see it go... BUT only for a second, because after a split moment of mourning, our steaks arrived. I ordered the aged ribeye, which I don't really remember eating, I'm pretty sure I blacked and went to food heaven. I, being a foodie, got both the mashed potatoes and French fries with the steak, neither stood any type of chance of leftover survival. My husband got the prime rib, which be said was perfectly cooked, wonderfully crusted, tender and I'm pretty sure he just drooled off into a food coma. Then, as if we weren't all ready to explode, we opted to get their chocolate cheesecake. Which if this cheesecake was a person, it would be a billionaire (hahaha, get it, get it? Because it was super rich, haha). It was creamy and tasty and everything you'd ever want in a dessert. I can't wait to return for another great dining experience.",

Oh..the table bread was 5 star (although they were stingy with the butter.)  Was ready to leave so we did not try the carrot cake.    Our server, Tabitha, was good.  Just the right amount of interaction.  Pretty much left us alone, yet was there when we needed something.  Note to Management:  You should allow happy hour prices in the dining room.  Especially on Saturdays.  Lost revenue.  People that drink, drink more and more than likely eat more.   We were disappointed when told that the drink prices were only good at the bar.  On the other hand if I was so smart, I would be the owner.  Will return at a busier time so we do not feel like we are participating in a shift change.",

    "text": "Not the worst experience but definitely not good, we love firebirds and even pick up food to go regularly 3-4 times a month. This time around we decided to dine in since it seemed pretty open. We were told there would be about a 15 minute wait unless we sat at the bar area which is first come first serve. We weren't in a rush but were definitely hungry. Our waitress came by and took our drink orders, our drinks arrived after 10 minutes of just sitting at the bar end. We knew what we wanted when we came in, we frequent this place. I ordered the strawberry jicama salad which is a staple in their menu. My husband ordered the Cesar salad with grilled chicken, as she left with our order she got another table right next to us. She promptly got their drink order and drinks were brought out within a couple minutes. We asked for bread while we waited and the table that got sat after us got there's first, and their meals. Ours were just two salads and we waited a few more minutes after the table next to us got their entrees. At that point we wondered if she put our order in. When we got our food my husbands wasn't to his liking. He has had the Cesar salad before but the salad had little to no dressing, and romaine lettuce wasn't crunchy, you could tell it had been sitting out for awhile, she came back to check on us after I was almost done with my meal. She didn't even ask how our food was. My husband then had to ask her if he could switch out the item... she looked at the salad and asked why, he then explained to her that it wasn't good. She then took his order once more and we didn't get his Cobb salad till I got my dessert. Not a good dining experience. Will have to try out the Gilbert location instead.",

Man, how did I forget about this place while continually settling on The Keg or Flemming's for great steak in the Chandler area? Consider that streak broken.  Went with my mom prior to a concert this week and Son, I was not disappoint. Service from waitstaff was prompt, professional and never \"hovering\". Mom had the peppercorn sirloin with the au poive sauce and raved about it. I had the center-cut sirloin, medium rare and it was outstanding. I almost did a double take on the thickness; it was approaching filet thickness and grilled to perfection. Spiced pecan green beans ($6) as an added side was worth every penny.  I'll definitely be back. If mom is a party to where to eat in the future, I think she will persuade others that Firebirds is a legitimate candidate for steak.",

I had a soup which wasn't memorable. Our meal came out and it was cold as was the potato. They put it back on the grill but then it just tasted like beef jerky. So they made a new one but it wasn't great.   When you spend 30 dollars on a steak it should be perfect. The manager was nice and comped some of our meal. I don't think it was really fair to charge us anything but I'm not going to argue.   This place is generally really very good.  It happens and there are off nights. I expected it because the server took about fifteen minutes to take our order. We got drinks fairly quick but then he disappeared. I remember looking around and counting the tables. It wasn't busy.   One thing I always consider a bad sign is when the coke taste off. If a restaurant can't get soda right what else are they having trouble getting right?   I hope this place isn't going down hill because generally it's always been good which is why I am giving it four stars. Our experience was not good this past week.",

The food was impeccable, service outstanding, and comfortable just doesn't seem to fit properly to describe the venue.  I had the beef kabobs, medium, which came perfectly grilled and removed from the skewer.  The grilled vegetables had just the right amount of scar on them.  Outstandingly sweet tomato chunks and other fresh vegetables on the second skewer.  The green chile mac and cheese was perfect, just the right amount of heat in an oh so creamy cheese sauce.  My side spinach salad was wonderful, perfect amount of dressing and the right mixture of ingredients.  It will be my main course the next time we are there.  There were six in my party last night and every food item was prepared as good as it gets.  The crab cakes were packed with 80% crab and 20 percent crumb at a minimum. I'm glad to know my second choice of entree would have been divine too.  Finally, Kelly was our server and boy did she shine.  All of us at the table love to banter and get to know our servers.  She held up admirably and made our night that much better. Her kindness and desire to make sure we did not want a thing was exactly what I would want in all of my restaurant visits.  Thank you Kelly for being the outstanding person you are and stay in school to help assure that bright future ahead of you.  Folks, this is a great place to kick back, get a glass of wine, some appetizers and then the full meal deal.  It's cozy, warm, and inviting.  P.S.    It was my birthday and they helped me celebrate by having everyone sign a birthday card and bringing me a candle to make a wish on.  It almost felt like home, really.  Go Now!",

My steak was supposed to be medium well and it was really red.  Bread is so good, salad is yummy, and baked loaded potato was delicious, but my center cut sirloin was undercooked. My friends was fine and my boyfriends was a ribeye that was cooked good.  The biggest problem was service. We did a call ahead and were told 35 min when we got there it was only like a total of 15 min wait so that was awesome, since there was no one waiting anyways. It was an early 530 dinner on a Saturday. Once our food order was placed it took 45 min just to get us our food; so we stuffed up on bread while we waited.

We got the tenderloin salad ($15) and the 14 oz NY strip (30$)- this came with a side and we added another side (mashed potatoes and mushrooms).

The mahi tacos were good but nothing we would crave. Service was good.   Bread and salad would be 4-5 stars. Mahi tacos 3-4. The steak really is what dropped it he overall score.",

I wouldn't put it into the best dinner I have ever had but I have to say the Filet I had was up there one of the best and for the price it was a good value compared to the usual high priced chain steak houses like Morton's or Ruth's Chris. We had a party of 12 with pretty short notice and they got us going and the service we excellent.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "What a great meal!!! This place has a great atmosphere and superb food all around. I tried the crab-cakes on the recommendation of another on yelp and have to admit they were very good. The only downside to this dish, was that there were only two crab-cakes on the plate and when they were gone, I was left with a feeling that I wanted more. The sauce for the crab-cakes was delicious and blended well with the crab and was delicately adorned with cabbage and veggies (very nice presentation).  I ordered the Grilled Mahi for the main course that which comes with a pineapple salsa and a side of your choice (my choice was the vegetables). This dish has small chunks of pineapple, served over a perfectly grilled filet that was moist and very flavorful.  The vegetables were tasty and not under or overcooked (perfection). The service was great too, and our waiter Isaac, was fantastic, prompt and friendly. The manager also paid a visit to our table to ensure our meal and service was perfect (quality control).  My wife had the Ribeye steak and she said it was one of the best she's had. Our two friends also had the Ribeye steak and they also said it was fantastic. This was a great dinner experience with great friends at a great restaurant (3 Gs). I will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu and will put this place on the rotation. Easy to rate this place with a perfect \"5\" Stars.",

    "text": "Not sure if service is always terrible or if we were discriminated against due to our race... We went for my sisters birthday and we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. When we arrive 15 minutes before our reservation time we checked in but was not seated until 20 minutes after our original reservation time with no explanation... Others were sat first and I was confused as I'm sure they didn't have a reservation at the same time as us. To blow off some stress and kill time while we waited I decided I would go to the bar while we waited. The bartender told the only 3 empty seats were taken for some regulars who will be on there way shobeing reserved for some one coming shortly... I thought that was odd but I said forget it and  just got my scotch and went to our table because it was finally \"Ready\". When we sat no one acknowledged us for 15 minutes and I tried to get everyone's attention but no one even looked our direction. When a waiter finally did come we asked to speak with the manager who immediately made it seem like we were being impatient but said I'll switch your server anyway. I was heated at this point so I walked out and have no intention of going back.  The only reason I think it has to do with our race is because my sisters and I were the only black People there, and it just didn't feel right. No one else was sat 20 minutes after their reserved time, no one else was told you're not allowed to sit at the bar, and no one else when we tried to address the issues get ignored and spoken to like your opinion is not validated",

    "text": "Being from Texas we like our steaks.  This place had a great cut of beef, I had the 9oz FILET MIGNON.  HArd to go wrong with this tender cut, and there was nothing wrong with the steak but I ordered medium rare, well when the steak is 4\" tall it is rather hard to get it cooked, and it was completely raw and cold in the center with being very rare all the way through but the outer 1/8\".  If it wasn't such a great grade of beef I would have sent it back but it was still good, just under cooked.  My suggestion, cut the fillet a little thinner to cook or butterfly it if the kitchen can't get the center the right temp.  There is always using a thermometer and lowering the cooking temp too.  Other than that, no complaint.",

A great start to a belated Mother's Day dinner with my escort--my 7 year old grandson.  I had the chili-rubbed Delmonico steak (perfectly grilled) and southwest au gratin potatoes ($22). My grandson had the kids ribs (they say half rack, but sure looked like a full rack to me), steak fries, fresh fruit, lemonade and an oreo cookie ($8.95). We both enjoyed the hot sourdough bread and butter. The food and service were terrific. We both had to take about half of our food home since the portion size was so large.  Parking is ample and close to the door. The background music was some of my favorites from the 70s and 80s. Would definitely return for a special meal. Might try the trout, salmon, or pasta on the next trip.",

They have a fairly diverse menu, but the most popular are steaks and seafood.  I usually get the sesame salmon, which is excellent. It comes with fried spinach (OMG!) and mashed potatoes. I love this dish! The steaks are pretty damn good too, but you can find better in the area. They have a nice selection of beer, wine, and cocktails and look out for the specials (1/2 off wine when we were there on a Monday night!). Prices are reasonable for the quality of food, atmosphere, and service.  Not bad at all.",

My entire meal, which sat there while husband's fish was cooked, was luke warm and he had to wait while it was refired.  The only reason I gave you a second star was because you comped my meal.  The food is OK, but not good enough to wait 30 minutes for.  The kitchen is much too small to serve the large dining room.  And the whine when their alarm goes off is intolerable.  Go somewhere else unless you sit outside and only order drinks.  Oh, and the service was not as good as Village Inn.",

    "text": "Since we live near Chandler Mall, this happens to be one place we frequent about once a week....sometimes more (ok, we eat out a LOT!).  I have never had a bad meal here.  The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside, which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere.  They have an open kitchen so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min.  During the winter, the bar inside is great, as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails.  The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot.    So what should you order there?  Here are my favorites, depending on your mood:  The filet wrapped in bacon is a delicious staple at Firebirds.  The meat is tender and always cooked perfectly (I like mine medium rare +).  Wood grilled salmon - some of the best salmon I have had!  LOVE the flavor of the wood.  Ahi tuna appetizer - if you're going light and like ahi, I highly recommend this from the starter menu.  The mustard sauce they serve with it has a mighty big kick and is one of my favorites.  I've tried to recreate it at home, without success.   Green beans as a side option - ohhhh I know what you are thinking!!  Green beans? Yuck.  I'll get something else.  Well, everything is good but the green beans are the BEST!  They are sauteed with pecans and a little butter and they are soooo delicious.  You won't know it's a veggie!!   As far as a chain restaurant goes, this is a top pick for me.  Check it out!!  You can't go wrong.",

I go for the Durango burger since they took their amazing Pablano burger off the menu (complain about that if you go!  bring it back Firebird's).  The potato skins go great as an appetizer.  My other go to is a BLT salad with grilled chicken (get the raspberry chipotle dressing with this and win at life).  Only once did my food come out sub par.  I ordered a rib-eye and it ended up being very tough and unsatisfying.  A manager took care of me with a new steak and a fresh baked potato.  Problem solved!",

    "text": "I visited Firebirds with my wife during the recent Arizona Restaurant Week. I didn't realize it was a chain until after I'd made reservations. This would usually be a nonstarter for locavores like us, but the prix-fixe menu looked appealing and it was close to home for a weeknight dinner, so we stuck with the plan.  The place is BIG. Claim Jumper big, but not obscene like Cheesecake Factory. This was a bit of a put-off, but the dim lighting and well-spaced seating made it feel a bit more intimate. The smell of wood smoke in the entryway was delightful and did a good job communicating what Firebirds is all about. Both the hostess and waiter were polite and knowledgeable. Service was attentive but not rushed on what appeared to be a slow weeknight; we spent an hour or so enjoying our dinner rather than feeling like a \"turn.\"  The Restaurant Week menu was a great bargain at 30 bucks a head for an app, entree and dessert. Learning that wine by the bottle was half price that night was just a cherry on top. They started us out with a nice bit of crusty fresh baked bread.  For apps, the boss had a crab cake and I ordered Firebirds' signature BLT salad. The crab cake was well seasoned, if a bit mushy in the center. The accompanying coleslaw was a split decision--I liked it, but she didn't enjoy the tortilla strips that were meant to add crunch. Honestly, the crisp purple cabbage provided plenty of texture. I'm not usually a salad guy, but the BLT was fantastic. The finely-diced tomatoes and abundant large bits of crisp thick-cut bacon appeared in every bite and it was tossed with just the right amount of creamy garlic dressing.  Our entrees were nicely prepared, which is a tall order when one of them is a pork tenderloin--a cut that's not naturally flavorful and very easy to dry out. Mine was done to a perfect medium (as promised by our waiter) with a moist, barely pink center despite a great char from the grill. Another half teaspoon of the glaze and it would've been perfect. The wife's sea bass was cooked and seasoned well, but the thickness of the fillet was inconsistent, resulting in slightly overcooked edges. The potato sides (chile cheddar mash for me and a potato pancake for her) were both excellent but overabundant. We sure would've loved some fresh veg instead of all those carbs (and plenty of butter, no doubt).  Our desserts were nothing to write home about. The flute of mixed fresh berries and cream was light and refreshing, but nothing more than you'd expect. The chocolate brownie a la mode was a bit dense and lacked the chocolate punch and fudgy texture I look for in a good brownie; it certainly didn't give the impression that it was baked in house.  With the exception of the potato sides mentioned above, portion sizes were appropriate--satisfying but not excessive. The prices listed on the regular menu for the items we ordered were pushing the limits of what I'd consider fair; they certainly wouldn't be what I'd consider a bargain.  Overall, we were impressed. This three-star review is in part a reflection of my personal preference for small, locally-owned restaurants with executive chefs you know by name. Compared head-to-head against its True peers (upper-echelon national chains), it's deserving of four stars and will be one of our go-to places when we need a safe choice for a nice dinner with a mixed group of friends or family.",

There are moose heads on the walls and ridiculously high ceilings, so it's got that \"Classy Elks Club Hunting Lodge\" type feel to it...It's really open, yet cozy.  I like the wood grilled options on the menu (go figure), and their grilled chicken is especially delicious.  The ranch rings are um...stupid good. They are my favorite onion rings ever, and they're accompanied by the best ranch ever. So, it's pretty safe to assume that I recommend you try them if you like rings (and who doesn't like rings???). I also really like their salads, which you'll need to start eating more of if you order the ranch rings. Their ribs are also very good, and they make a pretty good burger as well.  The only downside here is that it's retiree central in this place. I don't know what it is about Firebirds, but old people flock to this place like it's Pensacola, Florida in November. If you dine here, get ready to wait for a little while and plan to stub your toe on a walker or two...  In all seriousness, respect the your elders...Also, Firebirds is a great place to get lunch or dinner. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I had out-of-state coworkers in town who were looking for a great steak place, so I suggested Firebirds.    I didn't partake in the wine list, but those that did said the wine list had a lot of great selections, and everyone was very happy with the wine they selected.  The bread that comes out before the meal is heavenly.  It was light, but crusty on the outside and super tasty.    For entrees, I chose the prime rib.  It was delish!  I asked for the end cut (which they had!) and it was perfect.  It comes with a small side of au jus and creamy horseradish (I asked for regular horseradish which they also provided). I opted for the sweet potato waffle fries, which were crispy and sweet.   The hit of the night was the Blue Cheese Fillet.  I few people ordered that, and I almost thought they were going to lick their plate at the end. It was covered in blue cheese and mushrooms, which apparently were to die for!   Other dishes we had were Salmon, a Chicken Pasta and another steak. Everyone raved about their meals.      Everyone gave a resounding thumbs up on the recommendation.",

    "text": "Update 4/27/13 We visited Firebird's again this evening.  We had a wonderful dinner. My husband and I sat at a table in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server. She was extremely helpful, polite and did not mind answering all our questions. We ordered some beer + a double shot of whiskey for my husband and champagne for myself for drinks with the lobster queso for the appetizer, which by the way was amazing. For dinner I had the sesame salmon and my husband had the 14oz NY strip. The salmon was some of the best salmon I have ever had, I was very pleased with my meal. Perfectly cooked with great flavor. My husband's steak was very flavorful, however, there was quite a bit of gristle which was inedible..... But the parts we ate were delicious. We were very happy with our visit this time, our server was excellent and the food was great. I'm glad that Firebird's were able to make things right and bring us back as guests.  Update 4/16/13 I was contacted by a representative from Firebird's, and was offered a gift card to make things right. Hopefully they come through and we have a much better experience on our next visit. Will update again after our next visit.  Original review 3/31/13 My husband and I came here for our anniversary. Food was good, I did not expect less for the price... So I'm glad the food was good. Service was lacking. Our server was slooooooowww, and nowhere to be found most of the time. She was so slow, our appetizer came out before our drinks. No sorry, not even any excuses. All the stars are for the food..... I used to love this place, but the poor service will keep me from returning.",

The server was extremely friendly and when she was not sure about a drink request, she asked the bartender and provided several options for the one person. One associate requested the steak well done (against our recommendations), but did not like it; she casually mentioned it to our server and the meal was taken off her bill - great customer service.",

    "text": "We happened upon this place since we were in Chandler for other business.  Nice, relaxing atmosphere, wonderful decor.  Our server was Naomi and she provided great personable/fun service.  One thing I always watch is how the crew works.  The entire crew worked as team, including the management.  Very customer friendly restaurant.  I also really like, and prefer, going to restaurants with the open kitchens out in front of the customers.  I do not eat red meat, but there are menu items that I could chose from.  Since I am a big salad eater, there were some nice ones to chose from.  The menu did seem a little limited overall though.  This place is a definite must for the meat and potatoes eaters.  My son had the wood fired salmon special ($14), which was probably the best he has had here in the valley (I took a small taste and found it mouth watering good).  The mixed vegetable medley that came with the dinner, was cooked to the point of  just being soggy veggies.  Absolutely no nutritional value in them and not very good.  We left them on the plate.  Still enough food with the salmon piece and the mashed potatoes, that he was full, which is rare for him.  I had the spinach/mushroom salad ($11).  Interesting that the spinach was sliced up rather than served in it's leaflets.  Nice simple salad and very good delicious vinaigrette dressing.  Quite a bit, so I had lunch for the next day.  We will definitely be returning next time we have the opportunity to be in the southeast valley.  I look forward to trying something different on the menu.  When they get one up here in the North Scottsdale area, we will be regulars.",

Could not taste and Parmesan in the potatoes and really just tasted like MP with butter. The steak was so charred on the outside it overpowered any flavor the steak had.

It definitely has the wood fired feel, with brick/wood interior and a nice patio to the side. The servers are above average. They were a little slow when I visited, but nothing too terrible.  They start with cornmeal bread and soft butter. The butter melts onto the bread, and is so soft. I could eat four to five of these loaves and be one happy man.  Appetizer - lobster queso with homemade tortilla chips. Even though I'm not usually a fan of combining cheese and seafood, this was quite good. It also had a nice kick to it. The lobster was fairly fresh and cooked well.  Salad - wedge salad with bacon. Definitely a solid salad in my book. Nothing mind blowing, but solid quality.  Steak - 9 ounce bacon wrapped filet with a salted baked potato. For a more moderate steakhouse, it was really good. Sure, it's no Durant's, Ruth Chris, etc, but it was quite good for the price point. The steak was very tender and salted appropriately.  For a casual meal, this place is a reliable option.",

We ordered 3 cocktails, one of them was a berry Moscow Mule, it was excellent! So we ordered another one and weirdly it didn't taste the same, so we asked our waitress if it was the same bartender that made it, she came back and told us that actually they ran out of Ginger Beer so they put Ginger Ale instead. Seriously? That's horrible customer service and we felt like they were robbing us, it's like ordering a gin tonic and they only give you the tonic. We were very mad after this. The waitress apologized and of course we didn't drink it.  The waitress asked us if we wanted to take a look at the wine list instead, we did, and we ordered the Meomi Pinot Noir, she asked if we wanted a glass or the bottle, we said just a glass. Came the bill, the glass of wine was $16?! On the menu, there were 3 prices, $12, $16 (1/2 bottle) and $36 or $32 (bottle, doesn't remember).  They took off $4 at the end because we told them it wasn't normal, poor customer service again. Oh and I won't even mention the $1 surcharge to get my shrimp spicy (wth...)  Anyway, not a great experience overall, I don't think we will be back. It's sad, because the food was excellent!",

    "text": "First time trying this place and it was overall pretty decent.  It is a mid-level steakhouse with typical American fare.  The bar area was very bright (to many bright lights in my opinion) and busy.    The BLT salad was terrible.  It was like that Costco mixed green salad that the cafeteria served in elementary school.  The salad showed up before the server even sat down my silverware and was completely drenched in salad dressing.  Tip: Ask for all dressing and sauces on the side.  The only thing worse that the salad was the service... One bartender was slinging drinks like a champ, the guy working with her completely left her hanging! Nevertheless, the meal continued :/   The worst thing in the world that could ever happen happened ... (Dramatic Pause) I actually had to send food back to the kitchen (glug, knife through my heart) I absolutely pride myself on not sending good back to anyone's kitchen but my medium rare steak came out with hoofs on still breathing, so rare.  The server didn't even attempt to argue, and rushed the plate back to the kitchen.  The refired steak was slightly better than the first but still not really delicious. I want to like this place ... I feel like it has potential.... So one star for the lady bartender and one for hope.",

I ordered the 7 oz filet and the server suggested I butterfly the steak so it only takes 20 mins instead of 30.  I've eaten plenty of filets in my time and no one has ever asked me to butterfly my filet.  I agreed and asked for med well.  That was a complete mistake!  My steak was like a piece of over done thin piece of cardboard with an overdose of salt on top.   Someone else In my party ordered the salmon that required a knife to cut it because it was still raw inside... gross!   The only thing that was enjoyable crab queso as our appetizer and the fudge brownie at the end.  Unfortunately I probably won't be back for a full on dinner, but would suggest just sticking to the bar food and drinks.",

We were seated after about a 10-15 minute wait. Our waiter was a very knowledgable young man who was not only familiar with each item on the menu but the bar stock as well. He recommended a good gin for my martini which was perfect. I ordered a large cut prime rib medium rare and requested that it be braised over the wood fire. It came out absolutely perfect. My wife had the Mahi fish which she enjoyed and shared with me and I agreed, it was great. Good appetizers and salads as well. We will definitely be back next time we are in the Chandler area.",

Tonight my family dined there and was greeted with the most amazing service I've had in a long time by a gentleman named Abdul. Cheerful, thoughtful, knowledgeable about the menu, anticipated every need, went above and beyond. It's funny when you feel like you get good service and then you get great service and you realize that your standards for every day experience has been lowered, what is acceptable is just barely acceptable. Abdul was beyond excellent, and every part of the meal was very good. Tried the fried spinach for the first time, my ribeye was perfectly cooked medium rare. The woodfired salmon and the sesame crusted salmon were both juicy and very tasty. And Abdul, his joy and gratitude, almost selfless attitude towards service. He pulled out all the stops for us.  We truly felt like we were his only table in the restaurant. 10 stars for Abdul!!!!",

    "text": "It's been a long time since I updated my review here.  Firebird's is really an upscale steak house.  And a very good one.  Over the years the food consistently has been good, and the service friendly and attentive.  The steak au poivre is not to be missed!  If you haven't tried it, you should.  They also have a fresh-squeeze lemonade that is excellent (which is helpful if you have to go back to work, or just don't want alcohol).    And their table bread is very good.  I have learned that they actually import it from Italy.  Having been to Europe I can say that European bread is dramatically better than American bread.  I've been told it's because the Europeans have a different variety of wheat than we do.  So their breads are different, and I think much better.  Try Firebird's bread without butter, even just a bite or two, to experience the difference.  On this particular occasion I tried the Delmonico.  Though as it was lunch time I opted for the Delmonico sandwich instead of the full entree plate.  This actually is more difficult to do well since one usually bites a sandwich instead of using a steak knife on it.  So it needs to be very tender to work.  And it was.  The seasoning was subtle but good, and it was tender enough that I didn't need to pull and tear with my teeth to get a bite.  Once again, Firebird's did it right.  My side was the steak fries.  Cut large, skin-on.  They were very basic (no seasoning except a little salt), but cooked perfectly.  Light crunch on the outside, tender inside.  My wife had the spinach salad and a bowl of chili (their \"soup of the day\" this day).  She really liked both.  I sampled the chili and agree it was very good.  Chandler Firebird's continues to perform very well.",

    "text": "Please bear with me, as this review is fairly long and convoluted. I am came very close to walking out at one point, which would have made this review a one. However, we did not, it became one of the most pleasant, and enjoyable experiences we have ever had at Firebirds. My wife and I used to live in Arizona for seventeen years. Over the years, we probably have visited Firebirds over fifty times, seriously. When our son announced he was getting married, we decided we would take them and her parents out to dinner. After a lot of discussion, we landed on Firebirds. My wife called about one month ahead to ensure we had a good reservation and adequate space. She also enquired as to bringing champagne.  The reason is we had a special bottle we had been saving just for this event. When she asked about bringing it, Firebirds said they were fine with it nor did they have an uncorking fee. When she later told me this, I was quite skeptical. Several days later, she called back to ask again. A separate person now stated the same thing. She said they are fine with it and people do it all the time. Well, this made us happy so we made our plans to bring the champagne with us from out of state. Fast forward several weeks. The big day has finally come. I will skip the stresses and misfires from earlier on the wedding day and focus on Firebirds experience. We ran by the bakery to pick up the wedding cake she had ordered. We had already arranged with Firebird's staff to be able to stop by and drop off our stuff so it could all be set up. My wife even called again that morning to ensure all was still on track.  The host re-confirmed all was good and we were a go for the champagne.  We walked in and the host greeted my wife by name mainly due to seeing our arms full of wedding stuff, as he had never met here before. As my wife pulled out the champagne, the manager walked by and questioned if it was alcoholic to which we said yes. He then stated they did not allow external alcohol on premises. I told him we had asked on three separate occasions and were told yes. He said, \"Well, they were wrong.\" The host then told him that we had called that morning, he asked someone else, and they said it was fine as it happens all of the time. The manager, brown hair, beard, mustache (never introduced himself) told the host \"well, maybe next time you should ask me, THE MANAGER!\" The manager then told us that we were welcomed to put the bottles on the table but just would not be allowed to open. To which I replied, \"That would be stupid!\" The manager spun around and walked off. I have been in some version of customer service for pushing forty years. There is never, NEVER, a circumstance in which you turn your back on a customer. He completely missed a great opportunity. For one, he never introduced himself us, the customers. He never apologized for his staff misspeaking. He publicly chastised a team member. IN ADDITION, he turned his back on the customer and walked off. The host was mortified and apologized immensely. It was not his fault and we understood. We put away our bottles and left the cake and other items with the host.  We had to push our reservation back an hour due to wedding event planning issues. However, we did arrive about twenty minutes past our original reservation so we asked if we could go ahead and be seated. They stated that they had sat someone where we were going and we would have to wait until seven.  his was fair as we had pushed it back and they had a full house. However, over an hour later, we were still in the lobby area. The host approached us and said that the table they had intended for us had a group camped out. No worries as that happens. She came over when it was ready and asked if we wanted to check it out. It was two table pushed together crammed against a rail with the other side blocking most of the walkway. We passed. I was about to walk out at this point and go down the street.  That is when Matt, the other manager walked up. His first comments to us were an apology about how long we had to wait and how honored he was that we chose to celebrate at Firebirds. He then acknowledged the seating situation and asked if we could wait five more minutes for him to set up another area. He seated us apologizing for the situation.  He extended an offer for three appetizers on him to help improve our night. We were not seated for thirty seconds when Sierra walked up and introduced herself, apologized for our wait, and informed us she would be our server. She rocked it. The food was amazing. After dinner, Sierra brought out a platter that had \"Just Married\" written in chocolate with a Creme Brulee for the couple. The night went from what looked to be an abysmal failure to a rock star experience thanks to Matt and Sierra.  Take good care of these two team members.  It does take a village and the kitchen staff nailed it as well. Major Kudos! We are looking forward to our next evening at Firebirds with Matt and Sierra.",

I find when ordering here best  to order nothing over medium well here or it will be well done as you asked which takes all the juice and tenderness away.  Good prime rib but I think I favor the steaks  to the point that I would recommend steak over prime here.  Fantastic libation area full of space to get comfortable and enjoy the wood grain that is throughout.",

Naturally shot for the lowest calorie salad, which happened to be the Seared Tuna Superfoods Salad- seared ahi tuna over spinach, organic quinoa, cucumbers, avocado, grilled corn, edamame and tossed with green goddess dressing for 520 cals and $16.90. It was a large enough portion for 2, but it was so darn good that I ate the whole thing! My manager has the chicken tortilla soup and the Colorado Chicken Salad- chicken, mixed greens, bleu cheese, dried cranberries, green apples and a raspberry chipotle vinaigrette. The salad looked absolutely to die for- 910 cals and $14.25. She highly recommended coming back at night to try out their steaks! Very much wish there was a location closer to me in North Scottsdale/Phoenix!",

However, the meat which they should be known for, is very very below par. I asked for a medium plus filet mignon with no bacon and got the opposite, so burnt/charred black with bacon. The shrimp was cold. My husbands burger was charred burnt. Only saving grace, is that they have the best mixed greens salad and french bread. Unfortunately after many years of coming here I think we may be done.",

The bartender was pleasant and had some great suggestions with us being first timers.   I had the durango burger and my lady had a salad. The burger was nice with flavor.

Over the last two years all of these amenities have gone down hill to the point that we no longer even mention them when discussing dinner plans.  In July there were two flies on the wall 12\" away from my husbands shoulder, the wall was covered with filthy food splatters.  The restaurant overall is dirty.  The food has become only marginally acceptable with tough meat, small portions, unseasoned, and unpredictable recipes (lobster dip appetizer). The mixed drinks are way overpriced.   So sad to see this location go downhill as it has and we will not be returning.",

Service was fast, attentive, and not overwhelming.  Steaks were fabulous.  Our server was absolutely superb at subtly upselling us - I could see it happening, but he was so charming about it that we bought into it (literally and figuratively), increasing our enjoyment of the experience.  Wine selection was great.  The meat-eaters had a very nice pinot noir and the seafood eaters had a very very nice pinot grigio.  I asked for an end-cut prime rib that was no more than medium, and got precisely what I asked for.  My wife got a small ribeye, rare, and also got exactly what she wanted.  Both portions were generous; I took half of mine home.  We all split two desserts.  Again, delicious, and very generous portions.",

If you're into that kind of thing, I didn't like biting into 90% spice ande 10% meat. But it gets better as you work into it..  The second time we went left me saying, \"What happened?..\" When we first came in, they said the wait was going to be 5-10 min., we waited 20 min. I just figured the food was so good that people had to be forced to leave. Wrong. When we sat, the waiter got us waters and took our orders (Lobster bisque dip for appetizer, Medium Well Prime rib 16 oz. with baked potato and salmon salad-with no tomatos for entrees),  but didn't give us any bread at all (which we saw on every single table).   I swear we sat there for 25 min. sipping water before we got anything. I was getting more and more annoyed as we watched everybody around us receive food. Apparently, some other waiter had stolen our waiter's Lobster appetizer. Why didn't our waiter just tell us that instead of the runner girl? The runner apologized, and I was like okay...but then she left and we only had one appetizer plate to share this thing. Urg. Lobster dip did not have enough lobster bits in in, more queso than anything.  As the entrees arrived, they looked great. As I chewed off some meat, it was getting more rare and I dug deeper, more bloody and the taste just overwhelmed me. I couldn't continue. I don't like being the ass that asks for a 'redo', but there was no way I was going to eat this obviously Medium-Medium Rare steak. Hubs got tons of tomato in his salad which he requested not to have. I sent my steak back and the hubs complained about the tomatos and salmon that was a bit rare.   The manager was nice enough to give us $20 in gift cards to apologize for the mishaps we've had throughout the night, I just wish the waiter would have done more to make sure we were happy.",

The bread is pretty amazing but I've gone to cheaper places that have had just as good bread.  Once our plates arrived the food was good but we didnt have very much food on our plates. I was very disappointed by the $$$ to amount of food we were getting. In addition to the food, it was VERY loud and I think a lot of it comes from the kitchen being right off of the dining room.

I had tried the quesadillas, buffalo meatloaf, sirloin steak, and a pasta dish. The pasta was nothing to write home about.  My 1 1/2 yr old loved the mac & cheese, a definitely more upscale version than Kraft, made with penne and a white cheese sauce. I recently had the shrimp, strawberry and goat cheese salad and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp were a tad too salty, but over all it was very good. I loved the jicama and spicy pecans, it added a nice sweet crunch.   I must say that during one of our visits I was going to order the peppercorn crusted steak and the server was honest enough to tell me: Unless you reaaaaaally like pepper, you should order something else. I appreciated his honesty, because I was not interested in having steak with my peppercorns:) and I like (actually expect) my waiter to steer me in the right direction if I'm going to order something less than appetizing.",

I give it four stars instead of five because when waiting for your order at the bar, the drinks are poured without a sense of urgency, which we all need after a long week.",

The burger was fantastic- smoky flavor from the wood fire grill, crisp lettuce, onions, and tomato. Beer was very cold -and delicious... Bartenders were friendly, and the mood very relaxed in the cozy bar setting.  Firebirds is great, and I will try to make this a part of my fine dining rotation of favorites.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I went to this restaurant last night for the first time. It seemed appealing so my mom and I decided to try it. The service was ok. Our first waitress was awesome. Then we got a new waiter for some reason and he was alright. My mom ordered the prime rib with a baked potato and I ordered the sirloin with mashed potatoes and we both got a green salad. Her prime rib was cooked medium well and my sirloin was cooked medium. My steak was burnt on the outside and really pink on the inside. It didn't taste too bad but it was hard to chew as it wasn't very tender. For the price of the food I at least expected it to come with 2 sides but you only get one and you can add more for a not so good price. After we were done spending our $69 plus tip on mediocre food and drinks we went home and we both started to feel sick. So we went to bed. The next day aka today we both had upset stomachs, the chills, and nausea. I have been throwing up and have been in and out of the bathroom all day. I have a headache and I am weak. I think it's safe to say we got food poisoning. Next time I will get a decent steak/meal at a good price at Texas Roadhouse. I'm mad that I spent $80 just to get sick off of this food. Never again!",

The reason there is only 4 starts, is because we got here we decided to sit on patio because the weather was perfect. We wanted to enjoy the nice temps before it's too hot, and about 20 minutes after sitting down another couple came out to sit and the women decided she was cold and had the heaters put on. The heaters were beyond hot and made the experience awful. The manager agreed to turn it off and on but it never felt like it was off much. My 10 month old was bright red on his face and arms from the heat, but that didn't seem to matter. Johanna was great through the whole experience. The food was fabulous, but was hard to enjoy when you are sweating and worrying about your baby overheating. We couldn't move tables outside because the ones available were all high top and there was an hour wait inside. We did appreciate the manager taking care of some of the items on our bill for the inconvenience, but it was still uncomfortable all night. We will definitely come back for the food and for Johanna's service. Maybe sit inside, because it's not enjoyable with heat blowing on you outside.",

I did, last time I visited, try their onion ranch rings, which were tasty. Their brownie for dessert wasn't bad either.   The decor is just a typical smokehouse/tavern feel. It's kind of dark in there except for in a few areas. The bar is large and it looks nice. They have a huge variety of liquor.  Overall, I'm not opposed to going to Firebird's but I probably won't go out of my way to choose it over some other places.",

    "text": "This was our first time visiting Firebirds. The interior was clean and dark, reminding me of The Keg or a similar steakhouse atmosphere. The staff was very kind, and the customer service excellent. They had some good tunes pumped in as well. We jammed out some Boz Scaggs while dining.  As an appetizer, we had the coconut shrimp. They were cooked well, and were in a bed of unique citrus slaw, which was a hit at the table. The warm bread was also well received. The outside was crusty and the inside soft and buttery. My husband and I had the portabella sandwich; he with fresh fruit and me with tater tots (don't judge me) and a vegetarian black bean soup. The tots were hot and crisp. The fruit was, in fact, fresh, but was your normal fruit cup medley. The sandwich was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of balsamic - not too much to overpower. The rosemary focaccia was great, and absorbed the vinegar for a robust flavor. The vegetarian black bean soup was a bit too spicy for me, but packed tons of flavor. The first time around, I had to send it back because there was a giant unannounced ball of sour cream in the soup. I'm perplexed why one would list it as vegetarian, then drop a glob of animal product in there, which you find by surprise at the bottom of your bowl. I was disappointed in the ignorance of that menu move.  Our companions had the wood-grilled salmon with green beans and the pineapple chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Both enjoyed their meals. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the beans fresh and al dente.   Shared dessert was a warm carrot cake with warm caramel syrup. The piece of cake was huge... Definitely to be shared. The cream cheese frosting was utterly sinful. I had a cup of hot tropical green tea. They had a cute little box of Evolution tea. I enjoyed it greatly.  Lastly, I give huge props to our great server Aristotle. He was attentive and accommodating. He didn't split the bill like we asked, but that's not a big deal. My drink was always full, and an empty plate never stayed in the table for long. A replacement soup came fast and with apology, and leftovers promptly boxed and bagged.  For a party of 4, with meals, drinks, appetizers and dessert, the bill was around $150.  We felt thoroughly satisfied by our meal at Firebirds, and will certainly return in the future.",

You can tell the staff truly enjoys their job and everyone helps each other out like family. I would recommend this place to anyone.   I have to say one last thing. I celebrated my birthday/engagement party there the staff made a design of a ring on my plate and said congrats, and several of the staff came by and congratulated me. How thoughtful!

First off, the atmosphere is everything you would expect, very friendly staff, the food is out of this world, the decor is everything you would want, and the food is amazing!!! (I know I already stated that). I ordered a cocktail red sangria and it was very smooth and I loved the bite size fruits I enjoyed after my drink.   I was contemplating between the New York strip or the delmonico and I ended up ordering the delmonico medium well and it was so buttery and tender and juicy and I'm getting hungry again writing this post.   The complimentary bread and butter is something so simple and what 95% of restaurants serve but they have a special kind of fresh warm sour dough complimentary bread. Absolutely amazing!   Overall, YOU SHOULD TRY THIS PLACE! Promise, You won't regret it.",

She requested the pomegranate sunrise martini for my friend and explained in detail what the ingredients were so we can make it at home...even wrote it down for us...She was amazing, very social and knowledgeable.  When we were seated, our waitress Gabriell, was very accommodating, very nice, and always checking on us. I had the center cut steak with the loaded baked potato, it was delicious, and I had the caramel brule' cheesecake was phenomenal!

As much as we have eaten out, we have never dined here - ever!  Whenever I see the word \"grill\" at an establishment, I always associate it with a Bar and Grill. Hence, my expectations are often automatically lowered.  That was definitely an incorrect assumption when it comes to Firebirds. This place is well appointed, expansive, inviting and classy. It is definitely unlike any preconceived notion that I had had about establishments such as these.  They were cordial in their greeting, prompt in their seating; in spite of our large party. And the service never missed a beat.  The food was excellent. Most of us ordered one of their steak offerings, although one went for the steak and shrimp, and another had the pork chops. The waiter was kind enough to offer my beloved an amazingly delicious flan cheesecake that she shared with all of us.   The only quibble was a too sweet dressing on her salad, but other than that it was a perfect evening, only made more perfect by the company we kept.",

    "text": "We come here pretty often for lunch time and last night was our first visit for dinner. Called during lunch time to set up a dinner reservation for three at 6:30 PM.   We couldn't have asked for a more perfect evening- our server Jordan took such good care of us. Really made for an awesome night out with her attentiveness but not annoying. A line that can easily get crossed fast, lol.   This place reminds me of Houston's in Scottsdale. A little more of a dressier place but not stuffy. Great menu options to suit everyone and even has a kids menu. They bring you a nice small loaf of bread with room temperature butter- if you know me, you know that I greatly appreciate this! Nothing worse than trying to spread cold butter on hot bread.  Started with the smoked wings. Nice smoke flavor and right amount of sauce. Some may say it's not spicy enough- I happen to like mild wings so this was perfect for me.  For my entree- I ordered the meatloaf. Comes with two thick slices of meatloaf perfectly seasoned and tender. Airy mashed potatoes and green beans with candied pecan pieces. The meatloaf comes with a nice mushroom gravy sauce. You can certainly make two meals out of this entree as it very rich. Ended up packing a slice of meatloaf, potatoes and green beans to take for leftovers. Will definitely order this dish again.  For dessert we had the lemon cake. Was told it's a new summertime dessert offering. You get a decent slice of cake that's nice and cold! Comes with a little thing of blackberry sauce that is also served cold. That cake was so delicious! It's definitely been a while since we have had cold cake and appreciated that detail.",

I also ordered the fried shrimp tossed in siracha and mayo. I ordered the pineapple chicken skewers and cheesy potatoes. The food was delicious and juicy with very minimal complaints.

The portions are generous, I am pretty sure my 10oz prime rib was larger than advertised.  A pet peeve of mine when it comes to prime rib is when the restaurant roasts the rib to rare, or medium rare then sticks my plate under the broiler to get my \"medium\" order which is really easy to spot and basically ruins the order. That is never the case at Firebirds. Perfectly roasted properly and served with au jus and creamy horseradish. Not fatty or chewy either.  The fresh sourdough loaves are also endless and soft as pillows. I love their loaded baked potatoes because they are soft and fresh. Pet peeve number 2 is the reheated baked potato, which is the norm at most restaurants these days. A fresh baked potato is fluffy in the inside, not dense.  The dessert menu could use some attention. I also recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because this location is very busy.",

    "text": "Prologue: An online search for a nice place to have Valentine's Day dinner yielded this result along with several good reviews.   The Plot: We began by sharing the Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer (served with mixed greens, San Saba Farms spiced pecans, and spicy mustard sauce).  That was followed by two entrees, including the Cilantro-Grilled Chicken Breast (served with crisp ranch rings and smoked tomato jack cheese sauce) and the Seasonal Grilled Salmon Bowl ( wood-grilled salmon over a warm salad of organic ancient grains, toasted pecans, asparagus, roasted red peppers, craisins and goat cheese, drizzled with citrus vinaigrette).   The Scene: We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our 7:00pm reservation time on Valentine's Day and it was immediately apparent that the restaurant was as very busy as usual. However, they had set up some additional tables and we were seated right on time. Despite being busy, the place still had a cozy feel to it and it was nicely decorated for the holiday.   The service was prompt and friendly and our server visited our table just often enough to fully meet our needs, but not too often to be intrusive. She was also very accommodating when fulfilling my fiancee's special requests.   The Ahi tuna was tender, properly prepared, and had a nice, meaty flavor. My fiancee loved the spicy mustard sauce and asked for some extra on the side for dipping.   The grilled chicken breast was cooked as well as could be expected to achieve the proper balance between flavor, texture, and safety. The two pieces of chicken breast were served in the shape of a heart, which was a nice touch. The smoked tomato jack cheese sauce was very yummy and luxurious. I ordered a side of Port Mushrooms, which were the star of the meal for me. The portion size was very generous and I would highly recommend ordering this along with any chicken or beef entree.   My fiancee was also very pleased overall with her salmon entree and was particularly impressed with how perfectly the fished was cooked and seasoned.   The Rest of the Story: The prices were reasonable considering the popularity of the holiday and the great service made it well worth it.   The only minor disappointment was that the seasoning on the seared tuna was a bit too strong, however we still enjoyed it.   Prologue: This Valentine's Day dining experience turned out to be one of the best in recent memory.  Photo Design By: Billie Z.",

When we arrived on a Wednesday night at 7pm the restaurant was full of people which is a good sign. We were told we would wait 30-40 minutes. We decided to wait on the bar. The bartender was nice to serve is some drinks while we waited. After close to an hour we got called.  After we sat on our table they took our drink orders. We ordered Aged Rib Eye steak( medium rare) cause we were told it's good. The food to about 25 minutes to come which is average but it seemed longer since our waiter forgot to bring us some complementary bread he was supposed to bring to us. When we got our steak we we like Wow that's a great steak. Tender,  juicy and delicious like a good steak should be. Service overall was great as far as refilling our drink orders.  We actually enjoyed the steak so much that we had to come back the next night. On our second night (Thursday) we made a reservation  so we didn't need to wait about an hour.  Once we got there we got seated within 5 minutes. I ordered this time prime rib medium rare as well. Then we received our complementary bread which was crusty and fresh baked. We had to order another one. 10 minutes later the manager approached us and told us the didn't have any medium rare prime rib but as if we where in with medium well. We decided to change our orders to aged NY Steak. Wow the NY steak was also delicious it was so good!! The waiter said the manager didn't have our Caesar salads charged because of not having what we ordered. That's great service I can say. Our waiter (Tatyana) was awesome in taking care of us. That's why I'm giving them 5 stars!!  Restaurant is very nice and clean!! It makes you feel warm place to be and fine place to dine with families and friends. Restroom was very clean the 2 times I visited this restaurant.  Is located next to Chandler Fashion Center so you'll need to drive around to find parking. It took us only 5 minutes to find parking.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone whom wants a great steak without breaking the bank. When I come back to Chandler AZ I will come back to do updated review for sure.",

    "text": "(The food is good but I said medium rare on my new york steak not medium well.. but was too hungry to complain so I just ate my food..)  I made reservations for 10 people because today is my dad's birthday. On the phone the lady asked me if there was a celebration going on and I said 'yes its my dad's birthday'.. We got there just in time but we didn't get seated till 15 mins after. I don't understand what's the point of a reservation..  When we got our meal, they mixed my uncle's food and one of my sister's food because one was supposed to be medium and the other was medium rare and both with loaded baked potato. My uncle just complained but both were halfway finished with their meal. But it was too late to and in my order- I ordered new york strip steak and I specifically told the waitress before she even asked that it should be medium rare.. almost done with my food now knowing that my new york strip steak came out medium well not medium rare. I wasn't satisfied but I just ate coz I was hungry.. didn't finish my food though and I love new york strip steak but come on.. medium rare is so much better!!  Our waitress handed us the bill which was given to us already without cake to celebrate for my dad.. and one of  my sister's said \"Its ok I bought cake. We'll celebrate at home.\"  Just overall, thank you to the manager though who could accomodate last minute with my family coming over for dinner!",

    "text": "I think the food is 4 stars. The steaks are huge and come with delicious sides. The problem that I had was the wait time for the food, the service, and cheap wine. We had a huge group of 10 and most of us ordered prime ribs. The prime rib was super thick and tender. I will say, I normally prefer mine medium rare but because of how soft it was, it was fine medium. If you're ordering prime rib here, I'd order it a notch below what you normally do. We had the lobster queso and strawberry shrimp salad as an appetizer. Both were very tasty. It was a small shrimp portion for a 16$ salad. I only remember seeing 4. The Caesar salad that comes with the entree had a weird flavor. Like a modified Caesar, wasn't a fan. The kids meals I got were steak and chicken tenders. I like that the kids' meals come with honest juice and 2 sides. The macaroni and cheese was described as a noodle but was penne, I had hoped for more of a spaghetti type based on description. There wasn't much flavor to the penne. The kid steak was a very substantial portion 4-5oz. My 2 kids were able to split it and still have some left over. My sisters both love eating here over the Keg but I love the Keg for the amazing food & service( we were just there yesterday). Even though we had two servers, I feel like it was very blotchy and inconsistent. I had to ask for A1 twice, I didn't get a water and I swear she said they are washing cups right now...excuse me what? What restaurant runs out of cups? I asked for my kids meals to come out first since it was late and it still took 30 mins. My daughter was waiting for the A1 but since it took so long, her steak got cold. First world problems obviously but these are the things that stick out in my head when deciding on if I should re-visit. The two people next to our large table seemed upset about speed of food too. Lastly, I'd like to complain about wine. How does an expensive restaurant like this choose wines that are 7-9$ a bottle? Mine tasted like rubbing alcohol. I couldn't finish it. We had the brownie dessert and that was like crack. The brownie was like a soft cakey brownie with ice cream and liquid caramel on the side. That was absolutely to die for. I see why my sisters love the food here but I'm not sure about the service. The service can make or break your experience anywhere.",

That might be a problem for some people who are looking for above average tasting food, but for someone who's just looking for a nice sit-down meal in a calm atmosphere after a long day, it's perfect.  Both times my steak was cooked just right, the fries were just crispy enough, the drinks (arnold palmer) were made with just the right amount of tea and lemonade.  J's salmon was flaky and his meatloaf was actually quite moist and delicious with the gravy.    Again, it is quite average, there are no over-the top flavours here, but it is safe and comfortable and the staff is more than accomodating (sometimes to the point where you will have 3 people helping each other with their tables) in every aspect.",

Three dinner entrees arrived 25 minutes later when we had ordered dinners for four. The fourth entree was delivered to our table about another 20 minutes later after everyone else had already finished their meals. The waitress failed to apologize and the manager gave a subpar apology. The food quality was not worth the wait or the horrible service.

I you ever need a place to take a really big group of people, this place can accomodate but you probably need to make reservations in advance as it is a popular place. Service has always been very decent. Can't speak to the prices since it's usually some big boss footing the bill. I've come here enough to have tried most of the Firebirds Specialties - Wood Grilled Salmon, Steak Au Poivre, Pecan Crusted Trout, and American Kobe Meatloaf. All were pretty good though I think I've had the meatloaf more times than any of the others. They have salads and burgers as well - something for everyone. I think we once hung out at the bar area where they had these huge jars of pineapple slices as well - so this place accomodates pretty well if your party wants to still hang out after the meal is done and plates are cleared off the table. Parking - pretty big mall so you'll find a spot without a problem even if it isn't right next to the restaurant. I know I'll be back. :)",

After my father-in-law told our waitress, the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered a free soup or salad.  He ordered the soup which the manager brought out instantly.  About 5 minutes or so later, the manager brought the new steak, apologizing for the delay and told us that the steak would now also be free because of the short delay.

Our order came out....the fries were wrong...I ordered sweet potatoe...got steak fries.....The coconut shrimp  were delicious...wings were ok...sliders were cold....when we got our correct order of fries they were cold.....overall Not impressed!! So glad I didn't come for an expensive steak dinner....and wondering why I have all this time to write this review yep...waiting for my server to bring the check as my credit card is sitting on the table for the past 7 minutes ..at least the bus staff has cleared the table!

    "text": "I walked into Firebirds and realized that I had been to a Firebirds before at Arrowhead a few years ago. I immediately began to be nervous because I couldn't remember my last visit, which probably meant that I stuffed it down deep into my subconscious never to be discussed again. Possibly.  Our reservation was for 5:45pm, but I arrived early to have some drinks with friends. I was greeted by the hostess who was friendly enough. I informed her that I had arrived early to have some drinks at the bar before being seated for dinner. She found my reservation, noted that I was here and welcomed us.   We sat down at the bar and were immediately offered a drink. My friend and I were struck by the beautiful display of pineapple slices sitting in vodka. Very pretty and inspiring. We ordered their pineapple martinis. YUM! A little on the sweet side, but still very delicious and intoxicating. We sat and chatted for a while at the pretty bar. Our bartender was very friendly and unobtrusive. One thing that I did notice is that the hostesses were a little unprofessional. They were horsing around, giggling, and chatting loudly. A bit annoying, but they were young girls. After two of those yummy martinis, it was time for dinner.  Our party of 5 was seated at a round table in the center of the dining room. We were greeted by our server Brittany who took our drink orders and delivered water and lemons with speed. We informed her that we were there for the Phoenix Restaurant Week menu. She took the time to make recommendations off of the Restaurant Week menu and suggested wines to go with each of them.  Ahh my dinner...  I ordered the Espresso Rubbed Sirloin rare. The steak came with Potatoes Au Gratin. I was a little nervous ordering a sirloin steak because they tend to be a little tough due to the \"cheapness\" of the meat. I figured I was in a place that prides themselves on steaks and decided to give their \"cheap\" steak a shot. It's a good way to test a steakhouse. They should be able to make a shoe taste delicious.  When the meal was served, my rare (still moo'in) steak got served to someone else. So I sent my steak back for a rare one. I am SO glad that I sent it back for the steak I wanted. The steak was absolutely gorgeous and delicious. It was not tough at all! The rub that was on it was a little peppery for my taste but it's a personal preference for me. The Potatoes Au Gratin weren't good. They were a little too Velveeta for my taste. It would have been nice if they used some sharp cheddar or something like that instead. I ended up eating my friend's poblano mashed potatoes with my steak. Fantastic! The mashed potatoes were very spicy and went great with my savory steak! I hope they are a regular side. They're phenomenal! The dessert I chose was the Peaches and Cream Bread Pudding Cupcake with Bourbon White Chocolate Sauce. It seemed I chose the right dessert for the night because my other friends did not like the other choices for dessert at all. By the time I got my dessert, I was full, but the bites that I did take were delicious! It was a subtle peach flavor with a great sauce I wanted to eat the whole thing but my stomach just wouldn't do it. Brittany gladly wrapped everyones leftovers and put them in a to go bag. She was so quick and effiecient. Very impressive!  I am so glad I didn't dredge up any repressed memories of a horrible dining experience at Firebirds. In fact, the \"mmm's and oooh's\" that were being uttered were very familiar. It was nice getting reacquainted with such a great restaurant! I don't know why I didn't keep in touch, but I plan on going for regular visits from now on!",

    "text": "I chose Firebirds as my birthday dinner. It's a bit spendy, but not the most expensive steakhouse in the area. I promptly signed up for the email club and even though I got the birthday coupon for $10 off the night before my birthday, it still read, \"happy belated birthday.\" I gave it to the waitress and told her it's actually my birthday today, but she still kept saying \"belated birthday\" lol. So as for the experience and the food... We went without a reservation and got a table as a party of two in less than 5 minutes. It's dimly lit and looks to be more of a casual dress place. The panella bread with butter was delicious! Sure, it's not the soft rolls with honey butter from another steakhouse (my husband likes those better), but I think it's just as tasty! My prime rib was soooo good and the au jus was salted perfectly. I opted for a baked potato and sauteed spinach as my sides.  The prime rib comes with a potato already, but it's $6 for any additional side. I probably had enough to eat, but really wanted a vegetable (even if it was coated in oil and topped with cheese). The food and service were great and I even learned of a food I've never tried. Jicama. We thought they were onions and picked them out of the salad lol.",

I had the chili-rubbed steak and the side of southwestern scalloped potatoes. The steak was excellent, prepared as requested. Loads of flavor. Just the right amount of marbling. Oh, and it was huge. As in... huge. Did not leave hungry. And I don't think I had but a single slice of the bread beforehand.  My wife had the seared ahi appetizer and a baked potato. Yes, an odd combo to be sure. But she enjoyed it completely. Didn't even give me a bite.  The service was excellent, going so far as allowing my wife to sample a wine. It wasn't to her liking -- was mine, but I wasn't in the mood -- and our server didn't even bat an eye when she opted for a glass of iced tea.   A solid rating. I saw many other tasty items on the menu and look forward to my return!",

    "text": "This used to be a place where we would dine regularly. Last evening we decided, on short notice, that we had not been here in a couple of months and  really wanted to go. Upon arrival we noticed that there were a few people waiting for a table, not unusual. We put our name in, told 45 min wait, and proceeded to bar. Discussing this it seemed a might bit long of a wait time considering this is a Tuesday night and really just a normal busy so they must of given us the \" worst case\" and would impress with faster seating.  Needless to say this must have been best scenario as 1 hour later we were still waiting for a table. I went up to ask and was told \" 15 to 17\" minutes more. The hostess table and employees there were very unprofessional and incompetent as well. By the time we were seated my appetite was tepid as waiting that long will do that to you. Our table was sticky and needed to be wiped down or \" sanitized for a second time\". I ordered  the ribeye as a medium rare, it showed charcoal crisp on the sides, not a little due to cooking at high temp but seriously over done.  This review would be lower than the 2 stars except for the fact of a great bar staff that evening that showed both concern for our plight and professionalism. If i am going out again to drink I would consider this place. If I am looking for good service and food, I will go to The Keg!",

You know, the ones that melt away all of the tensions and make you realize how lucky you are to live where you do, and be with the one you are with, doing whatever it is that brought you there.  These are the best moments in life.  Tonight was one of those moments.  It lasted forever.  From the moment we walked in the door, immediately greeted by two of the most welcoming smiles, to the casual stroll back to the car...holding the hand of that special person that has shared more than half of my life with me.  Service: Prompt, friendly, attentive and unobtrusive Fare: Perfection to the last detail, from preparation to presentation Price: What did it matter?  We both had filet mignon.  Hers with shrimp, mine with blue cheese sauce.  They blended nicely with the soft feel, but robust taste of the Zin.  They brought us an extra bread, hot enough to melt the butter instantly, but soft and subtle enough to taste and feel more like an entree than a free appetizer.    I've been here three times, and this is the second time that I felt in the moment.  Our last visit was memorable only in it's mediocrity.  Two out of three is pretty good.  I know we'll try for three out of four.",

I've been a few times for a glass of wine, but the best time was on a cold rainy night.  Wine, a fireplace...who could ask for more.    Well, one could ask for better food.  The food was okay...they have these yummy fries with blue cheese on them.  That was probably the best thing I had.  The three stars are mainly for the ambiance and wine...and the wine list isn't that great.  It's nothing more unique than you would find anywhere else.  And there are better places to go for steak, which is what my dining companion had.    If you are down at the mall and just want food, and want something a little better than Chili's head on over.  If you are looking for a good meal that you will remember, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I first learned of Firebirds a couple years ago by \"Lets try something new.\"  That new place because a favorite of mine in Chandler.  I would go as to say this is probably the best steak Ive had in town.    When you first pull int the parking lot, you can smell the grill from a mile away.  Just an incredible smell.  Thinking about it right now makes me want to jump into my car and head over there.  The staff is very nice there and of course like all fine dining places, everyone there looks like they stepped off of GQ and Vogue Magazines. The place has a nice steakhouse feel to it.  Wood all over, deer head mounted on all, and you can see the cooks making your food right in the back.  Always nice to see what's going on with the food.    The things I love most about this place is their bread.  Fresh sour dough loaves that come out piping hot with butter.  I call it \"Butt Bread;\" for those who have been here, you know why.  Best bread Ive had at a restaurant.  Another great addition is their BLT salad.  They have this great garlic ranch dressing that I have not seen anywhere else.  That with bacon bits, lettuce and tomato... delicious.  My personal favorite is their rib-eye and their dipped in, loaded baked potato.  I get the same thing every time now.  Yes I have tried other things and they were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  My parents went with my girlfriend and I once and my dad ate 3 loaves of the bread himself.  Yeah... good stuff.",

My son enjoyed his Chicken tenders, they even come with a little package of two oreos!  The potatoes are delicious!!!

    "text": "I've eaten at Firebirds many times because it's one of the better eateries located around Chandler Mall.  They are very consistent - the food is well prepared, cooked to your specifications, and seasoned properly.    This weekend, we took a friend out for some Birthday steaks.  The meal started with bread, which was tasty and warm out of the oven.  We didn't get any appetizers this time, but have gotten both the Ranch Rings and the Potato Skins in the past - both are fantastic.    Three of us ordered the same thing - the sirloin steak, which is a lot of meat for less than $20.  One of us got it well, another medium, and I got it medium rare.  They were all cooked properly and given to the right person - no trading!  The steak was flavorful and tender, and served with an excellent baked potato.  This is a throwaway side at many restaurants, but not here - the outside is salted, it's not microwaved, and it's loaded with quality cheese and bacon.  Delicious!    The other people in our party ordered the Chicken BLT salad and the Strawberry Goat Cheese salad and enjoyed them.  Firebirds does not skimp with the toppings - they're fresh and plentiful.  The goat cheese is especially good.  We sat outside, because they have a nice patio with misters.  The only complaint about that would be the singer that was performing on the patio - she was pretty bad and too loud, but I can't blame the restaurant for that.  I only have one gripe that kept this from being a 5 star review - they took my favorite burger off the menu!  It had green chile and goat cheese... amazing.  Though the other burgers are good, nothing quite compares.",

    "text": "Late afternoon lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Must say my focus was more on the company than the food but here's what I can tell you:  Friends ordered the Lobster Spinach Queso for an appetizer.  I had a little and it was tasty but not spectacular.  Nice big chunks of lobster which was a nice surprise.    I had the Pecan Crusted Trout.  The fish itself was so-so, not much seasoning and the portion was small.  It comes with a peach/cilantro salsa on top that I didn't care for and scraped off.  The star on the plate was the side of tortilla slaw.  Red cabbage, carrots, tortilla strips in a vinegary dressing.  I ate all of that and could have eaten more.  Their bread...to die for.  I could have been happy sitting there eating just that with butter and they could have charged as much as my entree and still I'd be happy.   The birthday girl had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was just okay.  My other friend ordered the French Dip Sandwich but she was so into her side dishes that she filled up too fast and didn't even try it.  I'll let you know if she says it was good as leftovers.  The side that she said was great was the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes.    The birthday girl loved her free dessert, the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake.  I love a low-key birthday dessert presentation and Firebirds did it well, just a candle and a happy birthday wish, no songs.  The portion of gooey chocolate cake was huge, with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce on the side.  Very yum.  Service was great, drinks were refilled frequently.  The staff was patient with us, not asking us to clear out as we sat chatting even though the dinner crowd was descending.    One note about the parking...it was fine when we got there around 3:45 but it was a death match as we were leaving.  People trolling around, cutting each other off, zooming into spaces.  Craziness!",

    "text": "Very enjoyable place to eat!   We decided to stop at about 730pm on a Friday night and while it was very busy were weren't waiting long for a table. We sat at the bar and ordered some Blue Moon drafts while we waited. Very tasty.   We were seated about 15 minutes later at a very comfy booth. I ordered the 22 oz prime rib. My guest had the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad.   We were brought fresh bread, still hot from the oven, to enjoy while we waited for our entrees. There's really nothing better than fresh bread, in my opinion.   The entrees were a little slow to come out but my guest was very pleased with her very beautiful and tasty salad. My herb roasted prime rib was delicious as well and came out cooked exactly as I had requested. The mashed potatoes I had as a side were very tasty as well.   If we disregard the time it took to get our entrees, I would say the service was fantastic. She was very attentive and seemed to be conscious of not interrupting the conversation.   The price was reasonable for a steak house type dinner and I most certainly consider this place as superior alternative to Outback Steakhouse or Black Angus type of restaurant.   I would highly recommend!",

    "text": "This place was absolutely AMAZING! We had delicious steak, outstanding service and an overall wonderful experience at this place. We were very impressed and would definitely eat here again. We took the kid with us and she ordered off the kids menu and was very happy with her dinner. Husband ordered a rib-eye and I ordered prime rib. The prime rib was to die for and is their specialty. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a good steak and good service and feel free to bring the kids along... It's not that kind of stuffy steakhouse where kids are looked down on. Another cool thing that they do is they have a call ahead service to get on their wait list. We were not aware of this since it was our first visit so we waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday night, but many folks walked right in and were seated as they had called ahead. It's in a busy area with many choices of restaurants, but this one definitely will be one that we go to again.",

They are smoked which gives them a great underpinning of flavor, then seasoned with traditional spicy or BBQ sauce. You get about 10-12 bones for $5 during happy hour and then drinks are half-priced too. These wings are so good they keep us coming back week after week.

    "text": "Yesterday I was on the hunt to find a restaurant in Phoenix that served lobster bisque.  Unfortunately, I never found it.   What I did find was Firebirds.  The only thing I had yesterday was a fruit smoothie.  I was so bogged down with work that I missed lunch and by the time dinner rolled around I was famished.  All day I was craving lobster bisque, I went all over town looking for it.  My hunger got the best of me so I stopped in at Firebirds.    I've never been but I saw the Shrimp and Strawberry Salad on the list, and I know I had to have that.  In obervation of Lent, I was not eating meat.  So this was the perfect choice.  I ate the bar and had a drink (my usual 3 Olive Cherry and Diet Coke), watch Apolo Ohno get DQed from the short track (that was BS call in my opinion), and I scarfed down my salad.  It was sooooo yummy and surprisingly very filling.   I think the thing I like most about the restaurant was my meal.  The bartender was very nice.  I think her name was Callie.  She was attentive and quick to bring me my drink (definite plus).  I would like to try other meals.  My only minus is that I felt the prices were a little high for a chain restaurant should be.  All in all, I had a good experience and I'll be back for that salad. YUM!",

    "text": "I have been remiss in not giving a review to a place that my coworkers, friends and of course myself spend so much time at.  This review is for the Chandler location only.    The list: - Service - always great!  Greeted promptly, always checked on and it seems there are 2 waitstaff per table.  (I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.)  - Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your \"non-carb\" moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) I've had a couple steaks and the prime rib, the fish and even dessert.  I swear I've never had bad food here.  Always \"meets or exceeds\" expectations.  - Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few \"odd balls\" that you don't normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar. - Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(   - Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When it's chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!    So...don't let the fact that it's a chain deter you.  Give them a try.  I think you'll be pleased.  Cheers!",

The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no dress code, so you had people from very casual to business casual. I noticed a few well-mannered young kids around as well. I liked the medium-lit atmosphere and tables were spread out so as not to feel crowded. Even with all tables full and people waiting, the noise level was great. We did not have appetizers, but several were tempting. The mixed green salad was one of the BEST I've ever had. We both got the 9oz bacon-wrapped filet mignon, medium rare, and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The loaded baked potatoes were just the right size and a side of port mushrooms went well with the meal. I can say that the wait-staff and kitchen are VERY efficient, each course coming out immediately after the other. So, if you want a slow casual dining experience, let your wait-staff know to slow things down. For me, our meal was the perfect speed (a little over 1 hour). It was about $90 for our meal + tip, which I felt was a fair value.",

We were desperate to find a place to eat in Chandler on a Monday night being that most of the small biz restaurants are closed Sundays and Mondays...so after driving around for 30 minutes we decided to give this place a try. We walked in greeted by a friendly hostess. Seated and greeted under a minute literally; and we were even more pleased to find that on Monday nights they offer half off all wines (except the reserve list). Our server Dan was THE BEST Server!!!  Very friendly, informative, and knowledgeable.  You can sense that he cares to be at work.  Management seemed to be just as caring. They noticed we needed a box for our food so instead of telling Dan or the busser to get it for us they handed it themselves.  (I can't stand it when I see managers in restaurants pointing fingers here and there) The food was delicious too.  My husband had the prime rib and I had the cheeseburger (i know, cliche, but i was craving one) and we shared a bottle of Stags Leap Petite Syrah for half price!! Couldn't make it for dessert but maybe next time. I will definitely return and hope to be seated in Dan's section!",

    "text": "Came here after seeing the ratings, prices, and happy hour menu. Should've read some of the reviews to save us the headache. For the breakdown:  Misters in the patio keep you cool during the Arizona summer. The 360 misters in the middle should be re-thought out as they create puddles of water in the center of the patio and the puddles attract mosquitos.  I called in 20 mins ahead to see if they allowed dogs in their outdoor patio and if they had room available. The host answered promptly and accurately and seated us as soon as we came in. The waiter was attentive and made sure to correct any issues we had. Manager was also a pleasure to deal with. (More on that later)  I ordered a Tennessee Summer, which came out watered down. My boyfriend had the signature Double Black Diamond Martini, which I ended up drinking since it was too sweet for him but palatable in comparison to my drink.The bread and salad get 5 stars. Boy, do they try to get you with that complimentary bread! You know...sometimes we base a place off their apps and Firebird's bread will surely have you fooled. Definitely thought that the rest of my meal would be amazing after trying their bread. NOT   We ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and beef sliders off of their happy hour menu, as well as a wood grilled sirloin steak with a loaded bake potato. I had half a grilled shrimp taco and my boyfriend ate the rest of them, we agreed they were subpar. Although they were overcooked, I liked the concept of the sliders served only with mustard. They reminded me of my favorite homemade grilled cheese that uses the same key ingredients: cheese, onions, and mustard.   Out comes the sirloin with the extra salted loaded baked potato. Had to scoop the butter out of the potato and brush off some of the salt and after that it was quite tasty. Made the mistake of ordering my sirloin Medium knowing very well that the steak continues to cook as it sits on the plate and sure enough it came out close to well done. I took the blame on that one, but wasn't accepting any excuse for the disgusting taste of that steak. You could immediately tell that the steak had been cooked on a surface that just had salmon on it, almost as if it was cooked in the fish's oil itself. Needless to say, I thought about feeding the rest of it to my dog but I wouldn't even give him what tasted like tainted meat. I brought this to the attention of the waiter who sent his manager over and they kindly said took care of it and asked if I would like another plate.   Kitchen needs to put a more Love into their food.",

    "text": "Ill start off by saying I do not want to leave this review because I have happily dined at Firebirds near a dozen times before, which is a lot for my income/age range.  I took my new girlfriend there for the first time last night 4/20/17 while saying that it is a great place. I love the fresh lemonade in a sugar rimmed glass and the Pepper encrusted steak.  We had a 10 minute wait to be seated, which wasn't normal for the time on a Thursday but neither of us minded at all. Once seated we were greeted by our server who was training another server (she was awesome for being in training). I ordered the lemonade and my date was not given much time to look over the menu before being asked if we just wanted waters to start. I had not even had a moment to look at the drink menu which had been with our server. I was looking for the Double Black Diamond Martini which I didn't see on the table cards or food menus which we were already given. I thought it was strange we didn't see a drink menu until after we had ordered our waters/lemonade. Also, we never received straws for our drinks throughout our stay.  I ordered a Double Black Diamond Martini and asked for Bread. I had finished the lemonade and moved the glass to the far end of the table, expecting to sometime soon get a refill offer or the Martini I ordered or the bread I asked for!?!. I do not know exactly how much time had passed but I was irritated, looking around and trying to make contact with our server. My date asked if I just wanted to leave but I did not want to accept poor service and leave to find another place to eat. Finally I got up and asked the trainee if I could get the drink and bread I ordered. While I was up I went to the restroom if nothing more to give the server additional time. When I came back my lemonade was not refilled nor did my date say that it was offered but I did have my Martini waiting.  Bread came shortly before the meal arrived and I was offered a refill on my lemonade and if I would like another Martini (I had finished it already) which I declined. Once the meal arrived my date asked for her own strawberry lemonade, both of them came back about the same time.   I was only able to eat about half of my steak before I asked to have it boxed up due to having a headache and not feeling well. I would have written something last night but I only wanted to get to bed and sleep off how I was feeling.  Overall I think I was very disappointed with this visit and it has left a bad vibe for me and my date who was there for the first time.",

    "text": "This place obviously draws a big lunch time crowd and was packed when we arrived at noon on a Tuesday. To be fair, the wait to be seated was only about 10 minutes. Service started out VERY slow, as it took us almost 20 minutes to even place our order. Once we did, our lobster queso dip appetizer arrived fairly quickly, and to be honest was the highlight of the meal. Cheesy goodness with large chunks of lobster and spinach. I would recommend starting with it. Lunch itself was fairly uneventful. My turkey club was fine, but rather lackluster. The fact that it came on jalapeno bread was one of the reasons I ordered it, but the reality was it lacked in flavor and was a little dull. The co workers I ate with enjoyed their Durango burgers. I could go back if I was with someone who wanted to go, but this wouldn't necessarily be a pick for return visit from me. It seems popular, perhaps dinner is a better experience.",

    "text": "Never heard of Firebirds until last night. We had a company team dinner here and I'm always game for a free meal. So what the heck.   Walked in and there's a small hostess stand with the bar just in sight which makes it very inviting. The dining room reminds me of lodge with a big deer head hanging on the wall staring at you. The place was packed on a Tuesday night and loud. People just talking and having a good time. Didn't see lots of kids so I would say it one of those adult type restaurants.   Anyways, I had the prime rib. They only serve 12 or 16 oz. Thick piece a meat that was cooked really good. Let's say perfectly cooked with very little fat. Just how I like it. So tender and juicy. Really good prime rib. It came with a fully load baked potato. It had butter, cheese, bacon, green onions and I had mine without sour cream. Baked potato was really good except I'm one of those guys that eat the whole potato including the skin. They put a ton of salt on the skin so if you don't brush off some of that salt then it can be a little too much. This was a really good dinner with a big portion.   We had 11 people in our dinner party and they were pretty good in welcoming us, getting us our drinks and refilling our drinks. Took awhile for them to take our order, bring us our food, and bringing the check. Little slow but I think that was okay because Firebirds is a place to relax and have a good conversation at your table.   Now I know about Firebirds and they have a nice menu beside steak which includes fish, pasta, sandwiches, and salads. Good variety. I'll probably be back to bring my family. Enjoy and Cheers.",

Last time I was here was to celebrate my brother's and my birthday-the staff even signed a little happy birthday note card for each of us.  When I asked if the wings were breaded, the waitress said she'd check and also bring me a gluten free menu which was astute of her. I do wish that they'd consider a separate fryer for non-breaded items so they could put more items on their gluten free menu, but overall it was fine. I ended up with a tenderloin and a baked potato.   I tried my nieces shrimp entree and it was pretty tasty too!",

    "text": "I toyed with the idea of 3 stars here, because the service was attentive, the cocktails were good, and the food was at least passable.  But not much more than that.  What got me a bit perturbed was that the whole attitude here reeks of some giant corporate machine (and how are we doing today, sir?  and how are we enjoying our meal sir?)  Everything was very expensive, too, and that knocks them down another notch.  A group of 6 of us arrived during happy hour, and had a wait of 20 minutes.  Not bad, and they were True to their word.  We bellied up to the bar and were informed that drinks were $5 (or was it $7) but only well drinks were that price.  Four martinis cost over $40.  Now I'm prepared to pay that in a big city, but this is suburban Chandler.  And it was happy hour!  Who drinks a vodka martini in a supposedly nice restaurant with well vodka?  Arrghhh, I am ranting now.  I had a salad and a steak.  The steak was a little overdone but tasty.  But then again, you can't screw up a ribeye too badly.  Nor a salad.  I can't even remember my side, I think it was mashed potatoes, and they tasted like, well, plain mashed potatoes.  Great decor, but I won't be back to see it again.",

Also, when I ordered my steak I asked for medium well. They gave me a steak that was more than well done.. It was burnt, very dry, and hard to cut into! I complained to my waiter Daniel saying it was burnt and he apologized. He told his manager and his manager gave me the steak I wanted which was medium well. I was still a little disappointed because I waited half an hour for it to be cooked. My family was already done eating so I just told them that I'd take it to go. I was expecting a little comp for their mistake. Usually a good restaurant will do that when they make a mistake obviously this one didn't care.. I don't think I'll ever be back here and I didn't even enjoy my dinner with my family. If you dont wanna wait long for your food please dont go to this restaurant well at least this location.",

    "text": "I'm working in Phoenix this week with another company guy, so we both looked on Yelp! and settled on Firebirds - a well rated restaurant in the Chandler Fashion District, close to the office we are working at.  On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.  The restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.  My dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.  Since so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.  Our ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.  I ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.  My dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.  Overall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back.",

    "text": "Been to Firebirds a couple of times, but after my last experience I had to write a review.   Firebirds is a great option for steak dinner. It's on par with other Chandler steak houses (The Keg, Chop) in terms of quality, but at a better price. I brought my family (a group of 7 adults total) this past weekend and had a great time. My father and sister are not big steak eaters and both got fish based dishes and both were very happy.   Because we had a larger group, I made sure to call ahead and make a reservation. They have a nice feature that send you a text with your reservation time. It also offers  the ability to cancel the reservation by text back. Once you get to the restaurant, they use the text based system as an alternative to a paging device. Nice touch.   Food: Don't come here expecting a Maestros or Morton's type experience. This isn't that level of steakhouse. It is, however, a great option in the lower price range. Pretty sure every steak dinner was under $30. Quality is greater than Outback for not much more.   Service: From the hostess to management, I was really impressed. Our table wasn't quite ready at 7:30 (our reserved time), but they did a nice job communicating that with us and our group didn't feel ignored. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress certainly seemed to be new, but she was still able to get my answers and make the necessary adjustments. My wife ordered her filet medium-rare and received a steak that was medium-well. She's not one to complain, but I knew she wouldn't enjoy this so we asked if they could make her another one correctly. The manager working that night, Pedro I believe, not only came over to apologize but grabbed her plate and made sure himself that the steak was properly prepared this time. It was a very busy Friday night, so it's nice to see he cared that much. He also removed her meal from the bill, which was totally unnecessary, but still appreciated. When her second steak arrived medium-rare, my wife very much enjoyed it.   I don't expect a restaurant to be perfect in order to get a 5 star review. I do, however, expect them to make things right if they make a mistake. Firebirds did that and more. We will be back soon.",

The salad we ordered did not arrive until just before our burgers even though we had requested it be served first (right away) since it took so long to order.

They are really generous about specific requests you have with your order.  - meats are cooked just right. you know when you ask medium rare for something but they cook it medium or medium well?? yeah, none of that! - They congratulate birthdays/anniversaries with a free desert/candle. it's sooo cute and sooo good. We got a huge slice of cheesecake. By this time our stomachs were literally about to explode.  Why it's not a 5? - They have an open kitchen and although it's not that big of a deal (since you get to see what foods they serve for future reference), im just not a big fan of it - Lighting is too dim for me. Yeah, it sets the mood but it doesn't have to be thaaat dark",

Another poster says that Firebirds is her favorite chain restaurant. I have to agree, largely because it never felt like a chain restaurant. The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is always good, and the ambience is pleasant - quiet enough to have a conversation without feeling like you are eating in a library.  For lunch, the Seared Ahi Tuna is melt-in-your-mouth good. The Firebirds BLT Salad is way too sinful to be called \"salad,\" but I will call it \"delicious.\" And the Durango Burger is to die for. It is piled too high for the average person to eat without a knife and fork, but I unhinged my jaw and took it down. Yum!  At dinnertime, I definitely enjoyed the Double Black Diamond Martini. Possibly a little too sweet, but really good just the same. You can't go wrong with the Sesame Encrusted Salmon. It was tender and juicy.  *Sigh* Now I am hungry. Time to plan an AZ visit and a stop at Firebirds!",

An online banker buddy from San Diego was in town for training, so I decided to meet her for dinner. This restaurant was across the street from her hotel and sounded really interesting. Turns out, I was right.  Since neither of us are big eaters, we decided to split and entree and add a side. We were both eying the blue cheese filet medium rare (great minds think alike!) Sara mentioned that sprinkling some of the blue cheese over sweet potato waffle fries is terrific; I thought the addition of green beans would help balance the meal. They actually brought out our meal on two plates (perhaps this is common now, but I remember having to portion split meals myself). The filet was perfect. Perfect!! The blue cheese slightly melted into the meat, crispy bacon tucked around it all. Adding a bit of the cheese to the fries were phenomenal (seriously, you have to give this a try). The green beans with candied pecan pieces added a nice fresh crunch to the dinner.  As much as I *hate* to drive long distances, I really would consider returning here just to have what I'm certain would be another terrific meal. Thanks, Western Union, for picking up the majority of the bill.",

    "text": "Born and raise in Maryland and now a resident of Arizona for the past 6 years, I am constantly searching for good crab cakes. I am a huge seafood lover / self-designated crab cake connoisseur and it has been TOUGH to find any remotely decent here in the middle of the desert. My husband has even (jokingly) banned me from ordering them because I am always disappointed. Well folks, the end of my 6 year search has come to an end. Firebird's crab cake are the bee's knees, the cat's pajama's, the stuff that dreams are made of! It probably helps that they are a national chain and not an Arizona desert location only, but they are here and they are GOOOOOOD.  In addition to said crab cakes we also might have had other food, I vaguely remember some bread, my husband had the Delmonico steak and my main course a Cesar salad. I opted to add shrimp (did I mention that I love seafood) and oh-my-god-I-could-not-even finish them, they were wayyyy too overly seasoned and insanely salty. I guess you can't win 'em all. Another small bummer was that they do not have my fav wine by the glass (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc). Only by the bottle. I don't like Sauvignon Blancs from California grapes (tastes like dirt), so I had the Reisling instead. Still good, just not my first choice.  There does always seem to be a significant wait for a table when we come in. So perhaps consider making a reservation? We were quoted 25 minutes at around 8 on a Friday evening, but were lucky enough to score a table in the bar which is open seating. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Overall, 4 stars - enjoyable ambiance, good food, good wine, and fantastic crab cakes!",

This is not really my go-to restaurant since I usually prefer more ethnic or unique food.  But their all-American menu with a wide variety of well-prepared dishes makes them the perfect place to bring out of town guests.  Steaks, chops, salads... and for lunch a variety of burgers that are all fantastic with those wonderfully tasty sweet potato waffle fries!  I also am very addicted to their bread and the lobster cheese dip appetizer.  The service is always good.  Competent and friendly but still formal enough that you don't feel like you are at TGIFridays.  Even the decor is sort of a chain but not a chain.  A few stuff on the walls to make it clear that they have a theme but not overly kitchy.  Over the last few years we have taken a lot of people here and everyone always leaves happy.  Well done, Firebirds!",

Tried the old fashioned and thought it was disgusting.  Tried the cactus martini and didn't care for it either.  Had a long island iced tea and that was the best of the three.  Had the filet with blue cheese and mushrooms.  It was cooked perfectly and was so delicious!!  I wish there were more mushrooms but it was still yummy.   Had the baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese and green onions.  It was so dry.  I took a few bites and didn't bother.  I payed for 3 drinks, pitched in for a bottle of wine for the table and my dinner.  No salad, no apps, no dessert.  It cost my $75 after tax and tip.  Not sure I will be back but a decent experience and delicious steak.",

I have had a hamburger here twice (top notch).  This time i had the parmesan crusted mahi and it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly and a nice portion.  The butter sauce was the perfect complement.  I had the veggies as a side which were fine, but dull.",

I've also tried the fish taco's and I was worried about them being too spicy. Our server was more than happy to make sure the sauce was on the side for me. This is one of my new favorite places.",

Our food came fast, refills were quick, and the manager stopped by our table to check out our experience.   We ordered a shrimp appetizer and several cocktails. We both had salmon entrees. I ordered the crispy fried spinach leaves, and it was the best thing I've ever eaten. I was thoroughly impressed with everything. It was a little pricey but I feel it was well worth the bill!

The Lobster Queso is our all time favorite appetizer from any restaurant. So flavorful, with chunks of lobster and jicama. It's delicious with the fresh tortilla chips they serve it with, and even better with their house bread. My menu favorites are coconut shrimp, firebirds pasta, and the Colorado chicken salad. My husband loves the Delmonico steak and the green Chile burger. The meatloaf is also amazing. We almost always receive top notch service when we come. Make a reservation if you're going on the weekend and don't want to wait. It gets busy for good reason!",

All the above drinks were flavorful, sweet and had the right amount of liquor..where you couldn't really taste it but know it's there. (Food $5- $7) Crispy Shrimp Tacos, Pretzels and cheese, Jalapeno Deviled Eggs.  The only thing I didn't care for was the beef sliders. I felt that it was lacking flavor. Our server was Samantha. She was great! Everything she recommended was good when we were unsure (I should've asked her about the sliders). I would definitely come back. Even for the regular dinner menu.

For our entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium. When they first brought it out and I tried it, it didn't taste medium at all. It was actually more well. Our waiter took my plate back so they can re do my order. A few minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the inconvenience. When they brought out my new order again, the manager was there to make sure it was exactly what I wanted.   Even for a medium, I felt like the Filet was a bit dry. However, they have spectacular customer service. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I was rather unimpressed over all with our experience start to finish. Let me start by saying I was excited to try this place based on reviews I had read. We had reservations for my boyfriends birthday and when we arrived we were not even greeted. When they looked up I let them  know we had reservations. There was no okay thank you, but simply \"the name?\" and then \"it will be be awhile\" before we have a table. No, you are welcome to get a drink at the bar, no we will call you when ready.... no buzzer..... So I asked do you call us or text or how will we know our table is ready? I was told \"we have your phone number, so you'll get a text\". When it was our turn to be seated we were taken to the far corner of an completely empty section with zero ambiance and a side view of the kitchen, there were plenty of open tables in the main dining area.. but oh well. Our server greeted us by letting us know he would be taking our drink order but was unsure who would be actually our server moving forward, when he came back, apparently he was to be our server. No body there looked like they enjoy working there. Nobody smiled. Nobody asked if we had been there before or if it was a special occasion. My food (citrus chicken) was unremarkable, pineapple salsa tasted like it came from Costco. Everything either had the too much butter or too much salt kind of seasoning. Just 'meh'. For the money spent (alot), I have had better similar food at other chains for less than half the price. It tasted like chain/processed food if that makes sense, certainly not fresh to table, the spiced pecan green beans were under cooked and lacked any flavor besides greasy butter. My boyfriend got the salmon and he loved it, but  the rest of his food was nothing exciting. The wine was good. The service was good enough, i.e. our water was refilled and we were asked how everything was..but nothing about the dinner was great. A runner brought our drinks and another our food. We saw our server once between ordering and the bill. They were not that busy and over all it was somewhere I doubt I would ever return to. There really is no atmosphere/ambiance. It felt like a dimly lit hotel restaurant and while all the pieces are there to make you think you are at a really nice restaurant, really it was like an overpriced over -hyped chain with a great wine list. Stick to local owned non chains if you want a truly good meal.",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night.  Our server was Abdullah, very pleasant. Started with the Arnold Palmers to drink. It was so sweet we had to ask for water to dilute it. Our waiter was very accommodating with that. Appetizer wings were just average. The dipping sauce tasted like a ranch/ blue cheese mix & was extremely salty!  My daughter ordered the Durango Burger, beautiful presentation & over all a good burger. It was a fair size that she couldn't finish. However, pretty pricey at $13.50 I had the Peppercorn Steak. $ $23.95. I was somewhat surprised that it came \"pre sliced\" in strips not as a whole steak?! The Peppercorn Sauce was ok needed a bit more salt & more of the sauce on the plate. I had to ask for a side of steak sauce. You'll have the option of a side excluding soup or salad, that is an addition cost. My first thought; was to go with the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes but asked the server about the Au Gratin & which he preferred. So, Au Gratin it was! Disappointed they were overcooked. It's offered up in a small ceramic dish separate from the steak. All the cheese had melted off & just the over broiled bubble residue coated the sides. It was oily & lacked in flavor. I will say the customer server was good. We were visited by the manger who came over & greeted us and was engaging. Our server was professional, but the overall experience wasn't impressive for the experience & price.",

    "text": "I like this place. It has the feeling of a fancy/stuffy place but doesn't feel that way when you go in. Attire is pretty casual. My wife and I go here as a treat and have been there 4 times. We like going for lunch. The menu prices are less than dinner, but I feel you get a good amount of food and don't feel like quality suffers. Service is usually good, but we have had 2 times where we sat a while before we were acknowledged and drink orders taken. Once they come the first time things usually go well from there.  The reason I am not giving them 5 stars is the chicken. My wife has many many food allergies. Soy, wheat, gluten, dairy and the list goes on. They are very good at listing her allergies and they take it serious. Her reactions are not life threatening but can lead to a whole day in bed with stomach issues. She is always good with meat and a vegetable. When she eats out we know hers will be more expensive because she often has to make costly substitutions or order a la carte. That is fine and one of the reasons we don't eat out often. I am just happy when she can find good food that isn't a bland, unseasoned chicken breast.  The last time we were there she ordered a chicken meal. The manager came over and explained that she would need to change her order. I give them props for catching the issue and for being honest. But I am annoyed at why. He said ALL CHICKEN is first marinated in a milk based seasoning. My question is WHY??? Isn't it possible to keep SOME unseasoned? You are taking a huge piece of your menu off the table for her and anyone who is allergic to dairy. I wonder how many people never mention their allergies and just now will be learning this fact.  Anyway, despite the one complaint, I like the place and will continue to go there for a special treat.",

I will say been here about a dozen times everytime my fiance gets a sirloin medium rare, only complaint is the kitchen always undercooks or overcooks it at least half the dozen times we have to send it back. Normally i would give 4 stars because of the hassle but being its steak it can happen and the manager always gets involved and makes sure we are taken care of. No hassle at all and redeems the evening for us. I never get his name but he has orangish red hair very pleasant guy.  Even the servers are kind and on point.  Overall my favorite dish is the durango burger there drinks from the bars are also good. I would suggest to skip dessert though i am yet to have a real impressive dessert here but none the less i dont come for the dessert.",

The bread had a very pungent odor.  Their prices are very high and pretentious.  But the steak was a thick sirloin that was unevenly cooked.  I asked for medium and the steak came out half rare and blue in the middle.  Hardly any seasoning to speak of.  The lobster was mediocre.  Tough, not all that flavorful.  Huge waste of 50 something bucks.  Could've done better at Applebees.  Staff was very friendly though, in fact when I asked for a straw, she served my straw on a plate...  Update:  Their management reached out to me and asked if I would give it another whirl.  Since they obviously care about their customers, I will give them a second try when I return to the area.

I had the salmon which was delicious and perfectly cooked.   I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because we had ordered a steak medium and it came back well done. I'm not sure if they thought we wouldn't notice it because it had been smothered in blue cheese sauce and mushrooms but it was clearly over done for medium.

Our waitress barely stopped by unless dropping something off. My meal came and and was missing my baked potato and when I asked for it we were charged extra for it. It was supposed to come with the meal. Needless to say if we are going for a steak dinner soon it will not be Firebirds.  The steak was delicious but not going to pay extra for what my meal should include nor wait 15 minutes for our drinks.",

    "text": "My family and I went here for my birthday.   I had been reading all the reviews and was hankering for a nice steak.  Nice looking place and the staff were all nice and they accommodated my fish food allergy.   But, the main course took a very long time to come out and when it did it was cold and the steaks were over cooked.  They said they had been sitting out and were not warmed like they are supposed to be before serving.  It took several inquires to get an answer out of them.   As much as they are charging for their steaks they should come out when they are supposed to and IF they are held up you should re-fire them.  Not warm them.  Not serve cold fries, cold mashed potatoes and over cooked meat.  We spoke up about the cold sides before we had cut into the meat and they did replace them.  When we ordered our meals we asked for medium and medium well, we got medium well and well.  And neither were juicy.  It's still not clear what happened.    The server was very apologetic and the manager was as well. They did give us $50 off our meal but that didn't even cover the two steaks.  I don't plan to go back.  I can go to outback and get a much better steak for less than half what these guys are getting.  If they had offered to comp the meal I would give them another try but I'm not going to risk my very hard earned money here.",

    "text": "I hate to give this restaurant this rating, however, my experience was rather disappointing.   On 3-16-17, I had reserved seating for a party of 25. To my surprise, I was told by Mary Wentzel that I can tell her if my party grows a little, a day or two before and she would accommodate. I sent her an email that she responded to regarding my party size increasing from 25-28 people. I told them it was for my engagement dinner which was a surprise to my now fiance. I was told we as a group had to order strictly from the group menu I had to pick out, and Mary and I established that checks would be separate, not on one bill. When we arrived they got us in pretty quickly, but when we sat down, there were only 24 chairs. I then spoke with a hostess whose name I do not have. I said to her \"Hi, I told Mary the party size was 28.\" She responded with \"No, you said 25.\" I then said \"Mary told me to email her if it grows, which I did.\" The hostess stoped listening to me near the end and said she would be right back. A man arrived and it was unclear if he was a manager. At this time I had pulled up my email to prove to them I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on them. I showed the email to the manager who responds with \"Your getting the table anyway.\" In a way that was not cordial in any manner. I was pretty upset with his tone considering this was already prearranged, and I was bringing them 28 guests at $37 a mouth!!! I was respectful the whole time, and I truly felt treated like a liar. But it became more irritating as the night went on. I had, a week prior, asked if my party can order off of the menu. I was expressly told after exhausting all options, that we must stick to the group menu, understandably.   Later in the evening, the waiter comes up to me to say \"Party guests want to order off the menu, do you want me to charge them separately?\" I asked \"I thought we are not allowed to order off the menu?\" He said \"You can, do you want that on your bill or no?\" I then continued with \" I told Mary that it will be separate checks. We should all be charged separately.\"   It was a night I proposed to my girlfriend, and all the planning and emailing with Firebirds was totally pointless. This caused me a lot of stress mainly due to the rude tone of the hostess and who I think was the manager. I would have also personally ordered from the menu because the group menu didn't offer what I wanted, but I already ordered when I found out I could have ordered from the menu.   All in all, I was truly appalled by the way I was talked to. So much so, I made this yelp account over it. All I wanted was cordial respect and good food, and all I got was good food.   EDIT* 4/15/17   The manager called me at a convenient time and was apologetic. Once they verified my complaint was legitimate, they made up for my poor experience. They truly did make things right. Thank you Firebirds! And again, their food was amazing!",

Our service was sub-par. Either the server was untrained or didn't care.  When we brought it up to the manager, he handled the feedback poorly.  He didn't apologize or express any concern. There was an adjustment to the bill - but any verbal response from the manager other than \"really?\" would have gone further.   Lastly, ordered a different side than what was part of the dish. When I asked if I could substitute, I was told yes. A $3 upcharge was not mentioned.  I don't mind paying more but it's courtesy to inform of changes to the price.   It's hard to believe that teenagers at in-n-out understand customer service better than this place.  I can see the problem is leadership.   I give it two stars because the food was good.  Kudos to the chefs.",

I would like to say that the management at chandler does a fantastic job providing customer service and it shows by the attitudes of the servers and bartenders. I was very disappointed when the cucumber martini was taken off the menu last year (back now I understand) and the Blue cheese mushroom burger. I was told at Arrowhead (in a very unfriendly way) that I could not get the burger or martini anymore. However when I was at the Chandler location the bartender who was extremely customer oriented and provided high quality service, told me they can always make the cucumber martini and Blue cheese mushroom burger if requested. I already ordered my wine so I asked for the burger and it was make for me last week. Kudos to the staff at Chandler Firebirds. Maybe the management there can go up to Arrowhead and provide some customer service training.",

We sat outside and it was warm, the low top seats however were pretty uncomfortable. There were no high top tables available so we made due and I really didn't even mind it too much.  Our server was Nadine and she was so sweet, always making sure we had everything we needed. We started with the Lobster Queso dip and Oh. My. Gosh. It will literally change your entire life, because it did mine! The chips were a little salty, so ask for no salt if you're not into it, but I still ate every single one.   My mom and I both ordered the steak salad and my dad ordered the pork Mac and cheese (??) I can't remember exactly what it's called but it was pork in Mac n cheese. You'd think it wouldn't be very good but it was actually delicious! Our steak salads were so good, perfect amount of dressing and fixings.   We were stuffed but decided to get cheesecake Togo. We got the creme brulee cheesecake and woah, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself but was forced to share with my parents (aw man).   All in all it was great food, great atmosphere, great service! If they had one in Washington I'd be a regular, but I'll always definitely choose Firebirds when in Arizona!",

    "text": "It's a shame what has happened to this restaurant. We have had some good experiences here, but the service has become unbearable. The last four of five times we have dined in at the restaurant we have had huge problems with service and always left really irritated. Ironically this was a restaurant that we used to have really good experiences at when we dined in, but the takeout was nothing but problems. Recently we have done much better with takeout, but now we really don't ever want to dine in at the restaurant anymore. I certainly don't expect any restaurant to be consistently perfect, but after four or five times in a row of being virtually ignored, and other problems, while dining at the restaurant, I think it's safe to say it's more than just an occasional problem, or just bad luck.  On this visit we went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, hoping to avoid a crowd, and hopefully get better service. Clearly crowds are not the problem. There must have been more employees milling about than there were customers. It started just like other visits, where it seemed like we were invisible. Adding insult to injury, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where there were only a total of three tables occupied, and two waitresses waiting on them. Yet, still no one would come to our table and wait on us. Just as I was about to get up and ask someone why we were not being waited on, a waitress finally showed up. However, it was not one of the two waitresses working the tables around us. It turned out it was a waitress who was working tables all of the way on the other side of the restaurant, and working more tables than the two waitresses combined on our side. We were the only table she was waiting on that wasn't all the way on the other side of the restaurant. Why would they do this? The restaurant was less than a quarter full, if that.  Sure enough, she took our order, and we began a long wait before getting our food. When we finally got our food, my son's salad was covered in Caesar dressing instead of the ranch he requested. He does not like Caesar dressing. This wouldn't be so bad, but once again we could not get someone to come to the table so that he could get it fixed. We waited what seemed like forever. My son staring at his food, me eating mine, and both of us with nothing to drink.  Eventually I lost patience and asked one of the many employees just milling about the restaurant if I could see the manager. The woman that I asked was walking up and down the aisle the whole time we were in the restaurant doing nothing but entering information in a tablet. Other employees milling about occasionally stopped and chatted in groups, but no waitress for us. Eventually my son got his new salad and we got our drinks, but we were there a LONG time. I was long done eating but had to watch as my son eat as he was just getting his food.  This restaurant is managed very poorly. I think most of the patrons could step in and do a better job without any experience. At the very least they could figure out that it's a bad idea to have a waitress come from the other side of the restaurant to help two waitresses who have less tables combined than the one who served us from afar.",

The chef brought the food for my other co-worker, one who has a number of food allergies and explained that he had made sure that they had taken all of those into consideration when preparing her dinner.  We didn't have to wait either - wine was really nice as well and they had some local Arizona brews on tap there.  Always loved the one in Durham, NC when I was back in Chapel Hill.

    "text": "The wait times are awful during busy times. I've served for years but have never seen anything this bad. Every time, too! We've given up at this point. The last time we were there, our server was so busy and impatient with us... when we asked to add shrimp to our order (upsell!) she scoffed as she said she'd add them. We were baffled why she would be mad for upping the bill. Then, to top it all off, the GM is an arrogant ass who obviously hates his life. Justin, Jason, something like that. He proceeded to talk in bad taste about his staff to our entire table, essentially saying they were all worthless and if he were doing everything, there would be no excruciating wait times, undercooked/raw shrimp being served... shall I go on? We mentioned one of the burgers was extremely overcooked and he said, \"well, we're not exactly known for our burgers\" and walked away. We paid the outrageous $200+ bill and left as soon as we could.   Save yourself a lot of time, money, and go elsewhere unless you enjoy the joys described above. And enjoy the guaranteed mandatory table touch time with the best GM in town!",

    "text": "The first thing that I noticed as I walked in, was the smell.  It was a gloriously wonderful smell, similar to liquid smoke.  The atmosphere was dim and rustic, yet elegant.  I could tell that I was in for a treat. How right I was!  The free bread was amazing.  It's bread! Who would get excited about that?  I am shocked that bread could be this good.  It really makes me wonder what it was I have been eating with my PB and Js all these years. For the entree, I had the 9oz filet and the Parmesan mashed potatoes.  From the moment the filet hit my tongue, the flavor explosion that hit my mouth was intense.  Hands down, the best steak I have ever eaten - even better than those in the Midwest.  It was cooked perfectly, had an amazing crust, and simply melted in my mouth.  I had the brownie with the salted caramel sauce.  While this was good, I feel the salted caramel could have been a little more flavorful.  I am surprised that I haven't gone there sooner.  This is definitely my new \"go-to\" restaurant for all special occasions.",

    "text": "Finally, a place to get an exceptional steak without going to one of the 'Prime' restaurants.  We've been looking since moving here a few years back for a descent steak & I've had some good ones but none as good as here.  While it won't rival the prime cut steaks, it is quite close and at only $21 for a 12oz ribeye and a loaded potato, what a deal. My wife had the spiced chicken pasta bowl and I'd give it 4 stars too, though I thought a little more chicken and less pasta would of been the perfect touch.  The onion ring appetizer is very nice as is the ambiance & service.  While its a 25 minute drive for me, I'd make the trip again and again.",

If you go there, you're sure to enjoy there mouthwatering Filet Mignon with fresh steamed green beans, and the au gratin taters are to die for ( I'm a huge potato fan what can I say?). You can wash it all down with a nice red wine such as a Shiraz or a nice Cabernet. The staff is always one step ahead and smiling. Now, you know you're in a good place when the employees are always smiling. Words don't really describe this place, the ambience, or the food for that matter, but I'd never refuse friends or family a treat to this place.  Regards,  Mike W. A.K.A Magic Mike Hotel Concierge",
