It's not right in old town which eliminates insane wait times but is equally as delicious if not better. They have a great happy hour and a HUGE menu. From speciality rolls to noodle dishes and fried rice, you aren't limited to eating sushi if you are craving some other type of Asian dish. We love the Las Vegas Roll, Nebraska roll and the Spicy Chicken Noodle Dish.  The staff is typically super great, quick and happy to have you as a customer. I agree with the other reviews, the actual restaurant isn't fancy and it's located in a plaza on Scottsdale Rd. but you absolutely wont' regret visiting!",

    "text": "I am very happy that we have a decent and reasonably priced sushi joint in Scottsdale as an alternative to some of the more expensive yet mediocre options in Old Town. Bei is in a very unimpressive strip mall, yet delivers some good eats in a humble setting (read: not much ambiance). I've had enough good and bad sushi to know that \"atmosphere\" rarely speaks to the quality of fish or talent of the sushi chef. And I like that this is much more laid back and casual than its neighbors to the north.  Happy Hour is definitely a bargain with a fairly large window from 4-7pm every day and 9pm to close. The sushi choices on discount are plentiful, though the beverage choices could stand a few more options. I like a good Kirin from time to time, but I really wish they had just one or two craft beer choices or perhaps a decent wine option. I do wish I could rave about the food as many 1-time visitors have, but I'm not quite there yet.   The basic rolls and appetizers are done really well. The spicy tuna/salmon are delicious and we loved the calamari appetizer (though please come up with a better sauce than mayo). Basics are awesome, but I'm always looking for some creative specialty rolls that are decently priced and play on great flavors. The specialty roll selection here is a bit unimpressive. A significant portion of them include \"crab mix,\" \"spicy crab,\" or a California roll toped with \"xyz\" - which we all know is menu-speak for imitation fish + more mayo - and it tastes like it even with quality fish added into/on top of the rolls. The actual fish they serve is wonderful, but why serve so much of it with mock-fish? It's overpowering and distracts from what coule be some very delicious sushi.  The service was attentive and friendly from both the bar and table perspectives. I will definitely return to Bei and stick with the basic rolls and sashimi for as much Happy Hour love as I can, but I'm hopeful they'll peel away from a the overabundance of crab mix in favor of the lovely fish they serve.",

The food can be a hit or miss when I come in. But for the most part it's \"eh.\" They only have Simple traditional/stereotypical \"Safe\" or \"Basic\" sushi dishes. Nothing Special to set them apart from other fast chain sushi restaurants.  I wish they didn't put imitation crab in ALL of their sushi dishes. They don't have real crab in their sushi and a majority of their sushi's have the same ingredients! They just arrange the ingredients in different order and they all have imitation crab in them. Food prices are cheap, but all of their sushi's taste the same and have all the same exact ingredients. The water taste soo NASTY. It tasted like sewer and was dirty and grey. It made me sick. Will never be going there again.",

There were 5 or 6 other parties dining in addition to my 2 person party (it was not a busy night by any means). It took almost 15 minutes for our waiter to even greet us. I mean it was to the point of getting really awkward and I almost walked back up the hostess to ask if we could please just get some water. Finally ordered some water and two mixed drinks. After nearly 10 more minutes, ONE of the mixed drinks arrived. Another 5 or 7 minutes go by and I ask our waiter if my drink is coming and he said 'oh yes it's on it's way'. I get my drink a few more minutes later (it only had 2 ingredients according to the menu) so I assume he forgot about it somehow. Then I ask if we can please get the waters also (at this point we had been there for more than 30 min).   We ordered our food and it arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The sushi was good and the green tea tempura ice cream was good too. It's just such a shame that the service was so awful. We had at least 3 different waiters including, I think, a bus boy at one point who clearly didn't have experience waiting tables. What gave that away was when he stopped by our table and pointed at my drink and said \"is that thing any good?\"    Just a really strange dining experience and the wait staff seem really lost and confused.",

It has a very odd layout. When you walk in you see a bar with a few TVs, and I don't mean a sushi bar. You then have to walk around the corner to get to the sushi bar, so it felt like the sushi wasn't the focus. I can get past a weird layout and disjointed vibe if the sushi and service is good though. Our service wasn't great even though there was almost no one else there. Our server mumbled and wasn't very friendly. The miso was too salty. We decided the best word to describe the sushi was \"underwhelming\". It wasn't the worst sushi I have ever had by any means, but it sure was far from the best. Our sushi craving was not satisfied for $60 so we definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS OVERRATED! Okay, I'm a simple girl. I really just love GOOD basic sushi. A good California roll here, maybe some speciality rolls, nothing too much to ask but this place has not impressed me and I feel the the reviews just led me on. First, the California rolls weren't good. I want to know how one can possibly make a bad tasting cali roll? I spit it out immediately. The rice was so sticky!! They really were shy on the imitation crab as well because it just dropped out of the roll when I picked it up. Next, the egg rolls. What If I told you that the vegetable egg rolls at Panda Express were more tasty than these? Not bashing, just saying. They weren't even full egg rolls, they were cut into little slice things. Anyways, the house salad was good, it doesn't have that thicker ginger dressing that most sushi restaurants usually have but it's cool. I don't know if I'll be back but this place seems to have plenty of fans and I hope the business continues to be successful!",

The waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. Who knee they made their own Terriyaki sauce? The lunch menu is also a steal! You van bring a friend and share a rice AND noodle bowl for cheap! Only thing that was a little disappointing was their rice for the rice bowl its not a sticky rice or Japanese rice...it was soggy. Would definitely come here again!",

Obviously I had my doubts that this was clearly a manufactured coincidence so I had to do some investigating of my own.   To my surprise though BEI justified it's reviews. I ordered yellow tail sashimi, very large and fresh pieces were presented elegantly within minutes of placing my order. Next the three rolls I ordered came out in a timely fashion. One at a time and almost as soon as I finished the previous roll.  I've recently experienced a different situation at another local sushi restaurant where my food was brought out with absolutely no order. Dinner first then, last appetizers and when I ordered another roll it took about 30 minutes to arrive.   The three rolls I ordered were the ASU, Tuna Lover and my new favorite roll The Checkerboard roll. The wasabi aioli sauce on top of the Checkerboard roll was to die for. I highly recommend  it.  Also as many other people have commented about and I feel must be address is the quality of service. Everyone was extremely nice, polite, and knowledgable. It's clear their employes love working there and when I asked how long they have been in business, accompanied with a large smile, I received a very confident and prideful response of 13 weeks today.   I rarely frequent restaurants but this one is sure be see the likes of me in the near future   Advice to you, Give this place a shot and what ever you do, try anything with their aioli sauce.",

    "text": "Honestly, my experience here was so quick & I didn't try anything except for a few basic rolls, but I like what I saw & ate, and based on that I'd definitely come back.   Bei is probably the closest sushi place to my house & sushi is one of those things I don't eat often, but when I crave it, I CRAVE it. I wish this place had a website because I got takeout. I decided to just to stop in, order, and wait. The place itself was spacious & seemed nice enough to dine in at.   Since I was trying this place for the first time I ordered three basic rolls as a \"test.\" I got a CA roll, Philly roll & honestly I don't remember exactly what the third roll was except that it was a pretty basic shrimp tempura roll. The fish tasted fresh in all three.  I was just testing this place for future reference, and it passed. I'd especially come back for Happy Hour. I believe it runs everyday (maybe not Sun?), and goes from 4:30-7:30. There are several rolls for under 3 bucks.   There aren't a lot (any, really) sushi options in this area, which makes Bei even more appealing.",

Now on to what I love and might help a few like me.  Most great sushi places I have gone are really lacking on the non-sushi dishes like teriyaki chicken and Katsu chicken. I love those dishes and am often let down by the attention to sushi being the only focus. Bei doesn't mess around like that. The Teriyaki chicken is excellent, tasty on the rice alone and never like the brown water sauces I have seen other places push. If you are not a sushi fan but want to take someone who loves the stuff, you will enjoy the other options from what I have experienced.   If you love teriyaki chicken, go here. If you love sushi, go here.  If you read all the way to this sentence, go here.",

But it was really really good, and it was a ton of food and I was super impressed. It came with the chicken, rice, California roll (4 pc), gyoza (2 pc), vegetable tempura (sweet potato, zucchini, mushroom, onion), and a house salad with really good Asian dressing. All for $7.50!   The chicken teriyaki was mixed with different vegetables and was good. The veggie tempura was probably my favorite. Even though I got it to go and it was at least 15 min to get back to the office and start eating, the tempura was still crispy and warm and was really good. I couldn't even finish everything.   When I picked it up I was greeted right away and my food was ready in very quickly. The service was nice and I have no complaints. I will definitely be back!",

In addition, the staff allowed us a few samples of other things including a dessert rice pudding that is to die for.    It's still early in the day, and what a great time to come in, no one is here so u get special attention!  Can't say enough good things about this little joint and if I'm back in Phoenix, it will be a stop.

    "text": "We were in Scottsdale this weekend and stopped here as this place had great reviews. Not sure how this restaurant has over four star review. I am thoroughly disappointed. Then saw that they give you free mochi for reviews. Explains how a place like this gets over 4stars.   We absolutely love Japanese food and sushi. The sushi here just didn't come even close to 2 star. The rice was over cooked and some of the rolls just had too much rice. We started with hot sake and dirty martini which were ok. Then we had the tempuras. These were crunchy but the veggies were cut too thick and the batter was too thick too. If you love tempura you have to go to Hanna's Japanese eatery. They know how to make perfect tempuras that are light and crunchy.   Finally I was going for two star until I for the rolls ... we had the spicy yellowtail and their Rolls Royce roll that came with recommendation from the server. I am not particularly a fan of fried rolls but though I could give it a shot and this one had so much rice. The spicy yellow tail had only rice with barely any cucumber and fish. Total disappointment.",

    "text": "Who would've guessed that the name of this restaurant, Bei (), can be translated as \"America\" or \"rice\"? As it turns out, this is quite fitting since they serve very Americanized sushi rolls.  If you're looking for gourmet specialty sushi rolls with high-end ingredients, Bei is not for you. However, if you want really awesome happy hour prices and don't mind imitation crab and you're a big fan of California rolls, then Bei has you covered!   We tried the Alaska Roll ($6.50) made with fresh salmon, crab mix, and avocado; the Volcano Roll ($9.95) which is a California Roll topped with a baked fish, crab mix, spicy alioli, eel sauce, and scallions; and the Philly Roll ($6.5) made with fresh salmon, cream cheese, and avocado.   The rolls that we sampled were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, the California roll is over-represented on the menu as a base for the majority of the rolls. This is a shame because the the True freshness and deliciousness of the tuna and salmon were overpowered by the imitation crab mix. Next time, I will stick to the sashimi and specialty sashimi entrees because I think that is where Bei really shines when it comes to their sushi offerings.   I look forward to returning to try the Korean BBQ, Ramen Noodles, and Noodle combos. Also, I appreciate that Bei offers some more interesting sushi options for vegetarians as well. I've never seen a sweet potato roll on a sushi menu before, but it sounds delicious!",

I made sure I checked in to get the free miso soup...score!  This place is surprisingly much bigger on the inside than I was expecting. They have somewhat of a segregated bar area, booths, and sushi bar seating.   We ordered the Alaskan roll, the Nebraska roll, Philadelphia roll and spicy salmon roll. The only one I wasn't really pleased with was the Nebraska roll because I felt it was somewhat over seasoned and soggy.  I really liked the fresh rolls though! The Philadelphia had big chunks of meat in each piece (unlike some restaurants I've experienced out in AZ). The salmon was very fresh and we got a lot of it.  I read about some of the 12-15 dollar rolls, they sound delicious! But I just can't bring myself to pay that. I am cheap. Hahahaa   We did get to watch some drama unfold between a server and one of the new sushi chefs. So free entertainment while we ate.   I'm definitely coming back though!",

    "text": "While visiting the greater Phoenix area for a work trip, we decided to see what all the hype was about at the Bei sushi bar in Scottsdale. Chalk one up for the away team for a great choice!   First of all, the atmosphere was super cool. You know how a lot of sushi places are like super quiet (almost library quiet)? Well, think cool sports bar, meets hip sushi restaurant, meets fun weeknight hangout with friends, and that would sum it up. There were lots of tv's to watch sports, nice bar area and a comfortable dining area. Service was very friendly and quick, and the sushi cooks were as fast as ninjas!  Now, let's get to the best part: the sushi. We had the Vegas roll, Crazy Alaska roll, Tuna Lover and one other which I can't remember the name. All the fish was very fresh and bursting with flavor. Usually when I go for sushi, I get a bit tired of at least one of the rolls that I order. Tonight was an exception to that. The last bite was just as delicious as the first, and we even considered ordering a few rolls to-go. Overall, this was a solid experience and I would definitely return. Thanks Bei!",

I'm just a white guy married to a Japanese beauty so I can't speak of the mother land, but this seems pretty legit to me.  Service is wonderful. Pleasant, well informed.  Interior is odd as others have said. Maybe they should remodel the entry?  Minor changes would make a good upgrade.",

We had their Bei special, which is a take on crab rolls (fake crab stuff), topped with scallops, creamy spicy mayo and baked - very filling and anti-health if you are watching calories, but very very tasty.  LOVED their raw salmon tartare and their butterfish.  Delicate dishes packing lots of flavor.  They have great bento boxes (HUGE) and lunch specials.    I was turned off by the \"old\"/worn feeling of the place, but nicely tended to by a great server.  Not the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, but not the worst.",

I sat  down and the menu had many selections ranging from udon noodles to specialty rolls. I saw and ordered one of my favorite appetizers (hamachi kama) and the sashimi special which is the 12 piece chef's selection.   The food came fairly fast especially the hamachi kama (the colar of a yellowtail fish), which usually comes after the dinner if prepared correctly. First glance, it looked very good but once I stuck my fork into it it was a bit overcooked, the meat was not flaky but a bit spongy and there were a few scales on the skin - Terrible!  Next came the sashimi and it looked good and was decent, thin slices of meat, the tuna was on the light side but decent.   Overall I would not come back again.",

So my friend was planning to meet up with her cousin who lives in Tempe.. so I asked her to if I could tag along and they were cool with it. They (cousin and the fiance) picked us up from our hotel and headed out to Bei.  Atmosphere/Ambiance:  I like the atmosphere here because it was not your regular quiet sushi place.. it was more like a sushi restaurant + sports bar with bunch of TV's + live bands on certain days type of combination. There wasn't any live bands when we went but they were playing good music.  Food:  - Love Hurts Roll (Crab Mix, Avocado, Topped with Baked White Fish with Spicy Aioli, and Eel Sauce, Scallions, Sriracha): really good spiciness from the Spicy Aoili & Sriracha, the White Fish portion was decent and the sushi didn't fall apart after a bite. - Chicken Teriyaki entree (Chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, vegetable tempura, miso soup, house salad): it was more like a Chicken Teriyaki sizzling plate! I wished they wrote that it's a sizzling plate entree than a regular entree.. but regardless it was good portion... I enjoyed my vegetable tempura the most.  Service:  Our server was pretty attentive to us since even though it was getting a bit busy by the time we ordered our food.  In the end, it was a great place that my friends cousin had picked and I can see myself coming back here in the future. It seemed like a great place for Happy hour shenanigans too.",

Usually it's an overall \"you get what you pay for\" situation, low cost and mediocre food and service.   But today was absolutely awful.   I went for lunch and had a lunch special, I have a food allergy and asked for the allergens to be left out of my meal. I was charged an extra dollar for the chef to LEAVE THE SAUCE OUT OF MY FOOD. Yes, a dollar to take an ingredient out of a roll with no substitutions.   My partner got another item on the lunch special and asked for no onions, the meal came WITH onions and when he told the server she said \"Maybe you can pick them out.\"  This place is going downhill and it's breaking my heart.  PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME TAKE MY BUSINESS TO RA. Get it together Bei.",

I highly recommend to start with the pork dumplings, especially with the sauce! I had my usual beef teriyaki rice bowl (since I'm not the biggest fan of fish) and it was so good and filling. My husband had gotten the spicy tuna roll, Alaskan roll, and nigiri. He really enjoyed the Alaskan and nigiri. We did end up going during happy hour so we were happy about the prices. We were also happy with the sizes of the rolls. (We were expecting smaller portions.) I would totally bring my family and friends back here just to see what they would get and hopefully they would let me try it as well!",

    "text": "Bottom Line Up Front:  Bei is a delightful surprise!  Great quality, fresh fish, awesome happy hour!  FOOD:  4/5 I kept it original and ordered Sushi Nigiri for Salmon, Yellowtail, and Uni.  I also asked for fresh wasabi.  To share with the group, I also ordered the Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl.  The fish was very great quality especially the salmon.  The only downside was the Uni.  I would give it a 3/5 based on freshness but all the other fish and dishes made up for it.  The prices are very fair and again the quantity provided was amazing.  The Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl is not a True poke bowl in the sense that the fish were all shopped up.  It begs the question is they are using quality parts of the fish or if they are including scraps and chopping it up to hide this.  I hope the former.  In any case, it was very good with a healthy ratio of fish to rice.  It was nibbled on by three people and it was enough.  Be sure to check-in as we had two specials -- free miso soup and free edamame!  SERVICE: 5/5 I can't remember her name!  Monami? Monoma?  She was extremely attentive and constantly coming by to check on our water, orders, and just overall satisfaction -- all with a smile.  She definitely sets the model standard for service and I hope all the others are at least as good as her.  The food came out as ordered and with a reasonable amount of time.  AMBIANCE/DECOR:  3/5 It definitely is better than what you'd expect from its location and its view from the outside.  I felt a little more like I was in an art gallery with the super white LED lighting and spaciousness.  However, I am big on the quality and service categories and not so much on the ambiance/decor so this doesn't really play a huge factor.  For me it was ok.  PRICE:  5/5 We came during happy hour so many of the rolls came out to be a dollar less.  Overall, I paid for spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, spicy ahi tuna poke bowl, uni nigiri, salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and two orders of fresh wasabi.  With Yelp's check-in, I was able to get free Miso Soups and free edamame.  My total bill came out to be around $55 less tip and tax.  Not bad at all!",

I've talked to him on my last two visits.  There are about 10 TVs here so there are plenty to go around.  The food here is good too.  They know how to make good iced tea (i.e. not bitter), which by the way goes well with pickled ginger, and the sushi I've had here has been as good as any I've had here in the valley.

We got an order of the spring rolls, I got the citrus ahi tuna sashimi, and my boyfriend got their chicken katsu bowl.  The spring rolls and the bowl came out right away. The spring rolls were delicious. I'm usually not a fan of them, but these were crispy and had just the right amount of vegetables. It wasn't greasy or heavy. I tried the chicken katsu and it was really good too. Unfortunately, my ahi took some time to come out. However, it was definitely worth the wait. The tuna was super fresh and I loved the citrus ginger sauce on it and the avocados. I will definitely be back just for that!  The prices are very reasonable and they also have lunch specials and happy hour. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'm sure there's something for everyone, even if you're not a fan of sushi.",

A fellow Yelper and I exchanged messages about this before I went because that Yelper's review states that Bei does not have a restroom for customers.  It does.   The sign out front is for non-customers.  I snapped a pic of the restroom sign as evidence for others reading reviews and considering this establishment----- because I almost bypassed this restaurant because of that Yelper's information. I hope this helps.  Lately,  I have been into Ramen and brothy soups in general.   Miso, shrimp and pork ramen to be specific.   Take a look at the picture of my Ramen <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#xSczojjTQAVoXmEqcY19yw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-...</a> and view the pic of the Ramen posted by Yelper Britt C.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#Gx2-zZuvY5ynZbUD27BlpA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-...</a>  They look quite different.   Mine had a few tiny pieces of meat, a limited amount of veggies and lacked adequate broth.   I hated it!  I can honestly say the 25 cent pack of ramen I made in college was better!  The veggies tasted canned. I expected a nice piece of pork in the Ramen like the aforementioned picture by Britt C, but there were only a few flavorless tiny pieces. A well known improvisational restaurant, that has monthly ramen nights, down the street has ruined my palate to tolerate ramen any place else.   I can not say how much I hated that dish!     I ordered a spicy sushi roll that I split with a fellow Yelper.  Decent roll.  I would like to try the Bei roll one day.   I went here with the international lunch group that I organize.   Everyone else ordered a bento lunch box.  They were all happy with their lunch and had a consensus 3 star meal.  There were 6 of us,  we were automatically charged a 20% gratuity.   I don't know if this is normal for everyone or if that is the case for groups.   It was not printed on the menu.   It aggravated me,  but alas wasn't a big deal.   They should print that on their menu.  2 stars - I hated my dish.  Because the location is cool for me for easy access to sushi in SoScott, but considering the proximity of other sushi restos that I like better: Return Factor: 15%,   .",

It was too sweet and every part of it had the sweetest teriyaki sauce I have ever put in my mouth! It was like eating a desert!!    I asked for the bill and told the waiter I couldn't eat it because it was so sweet and that they should put that in their menu.  He just said sorry and then the sushi chefs kept saying sorry, but hey it wasn't there fault!!   When the waiter came back with the check and i told him I would have never ordered that knowing it was the sweet and I hate wasting food he stated \"that he could have the manger come. \"I waited forFew minutes looking around on my phone but manager never came.  I tipped the sushi chefs and the waiter but I will truly never eat There again!!! Worst thing I have ever put in my mouth and that says a lot!!!   So sweet it should be a desert!",

We got the stuffed mushrooms which we're actually amazing! The rolls we're pretty good and were especially worth it for Happy Hour. We got the Spicy Tuna Roll ($5.50), Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($5.50), and Jalepeno Hamachi Roll (10.95). The first two rolls were tasty and a good deal. The Jalepeno definitely had a kick which was nice, but could have used a little more depth of flavor overall as a \"fancier\" roll. We also got the bottle of Shoes Chili Bai unfiltered Sake which was really refreshing and base decent deal at $7.95. I'm really glad to have made this stop part of our trip to Phoenix!",

We started off with miso soup- good not too over salty, house salad the ginger dressing was weak, Jalapeno Hamachi- decent. Our favorite was the Tuna Lover- yummy! Good flavor didn't even need a dip in the soy sauce. Also had the Michigan roll since it is made with cucumber (no rice) great option. The highlight was the butterfish sashimi - oh my melts in your mouth and was fresh! I would recommend this local sushi spot, it's off the beaten path in a old shopping plaza. They have plenty of TVs to watch your sports team, the only thing that was disturbing was their speakers, they were playing top 40 music but it was horribly muffled and sounded like a speaker in water. It would be nice to have a clean sound system going while enjoying your meal. The bowls look good too, maybe next we will try.",

June, the owner, attended to us an we felt very welcome. Unlike lots of sushi places, BEi doesn't offer just undersized rolls but gives you the regular fare and the prices are great! We'll go back tonight!",

Bei is easily as good as Kabuki, with super fresh sushi served at the exact right temperature. Very attentive and timely service. I judge a sushi restaurant by the hamachi and sake, and bei passed with flying colors. I'm also thankful they don't overdo the whole Americanized fried rolls with heavy mayo sauces. Always nice to see Mochi ice cream on the menu:)",

I think it wanted to be, but the shopping center location and cheap feeling ambiance sort of detracted from that possibility.   The food however, is good! I would definitely suggest, if you want a low-key nite, to come here. Everyone liked what they had and the prices were good. The ambiance is nothing special (and the music which attempts to make this place feel hipper than it is, is kind of silly). It's more of a 3.5, but I really liked the food and the price so we'll give it a 4! Nothing too exciting, nice staff, good food...if you are looking for hip, fun vibe, it's not the place...",

Sometimes the service can border on the bizarre though.  I've never had them try to rush us out but sometimes the waiter can just be.... awkward.  Also, the interior is just ugly.  The booths and the bathroom scream diner, which is just not the type of interior I'm looking for when I'm eating sushi.",

The staff is very friendly and on top of things. We were greeted several times walking in the door and were waited on / bussed by a few different people, but knew who are True server was.  Our drinks were always full and we felt very welcomed.  I have had several of the Sushi rolls, the yakisoba, spring rolls, tofu steak, edemame, and stuffed mushrooms. Everything has been great and all of it is recommended, especially the mushrooms.  The presentation of food is nicely done and looks more expensive then it is. It is almost a great date place but it's almost too comfortable and well lit, it lacks romantic atmosphere, but would make a great casual date.",

This is not high end sushi by any means but it's priced right and the venue is casual. We enjoyed our nigori sake with a chefs choice sashimi plate. All of the fish tasted fresh and was tender.

The place looks nice, on a strip mall, the ambiance is kind of cold, seamed to me like of a old breakfast place. I sat at the bar that is oddly positioned at the entrance and at first smelled a bit like floor cleaner  The warmth of the place is on the service, fast friendly and with a smile.  My beer was cold, off to a good start.  Menu offers some different spins on the traditional and great variety of dishes without being overwhelming.  I ordered some salon sashimi and a couple of different sushi.  I was a bit disappointed even though the quality and fat of the fish seemed good it had a slight \"fridge\" taste. May be the way the store it is not the beast? I don't know nevertheless killed my will to come again  Safe yelping",

We thought they probably went fishing in the fish tank and can't get the fish out. Then we waited 15 mins for the salmon skin hand roll. Then we noticed that only few people left eating, so we decided to order another 2 spicy tuna hand roll and the 2 nigiri, we thought maybe this time it will come out faster but it took another 25 mins for the spicy tuna hand roll and another 15 mins for the nigiri. Seriously!? Our order was not that complicated and you don't have boil it or cook it for that long. Over all the service was so bad but the food taste good.",

Best of all, the food was excellent. My husband's sushi was fresh and delicious, while my son's yakitori and tempura were also wonderful.

    "text": "This is my review/what I wrote to the management (and they never responded)  Hello Bei representative,  Myself and my wife recently visited your restaurant and I am shocked and horrified to inform you of our experience.  We were kindly and quickly greeted and seated and it was down hill immediately once our server took over.  Our server, Cody, took approximately 10 minutes to arrive, greet us and take our drink order.  His poor and careless attitude were immediately made clear to us.  He took our drink order and vanished for an overly extended period of time.  Eventually, another waiter noticed something was not right and came over to check on us and brought us our drinks.  The waiter then went and found Cody, who then came over and took our food order with his poor attitude and rude demeanor.  We were a little confused about the menu pricing so Cody informed us that \"the management does not know what they are doing and won't change the menu to be clear to customers\".  That was a very disrespectful comment about his superiors (regardless of the situation) and quite shocking to us.  Here is where things become horrific.  From where we were seated, we could see inside the kitchen (behind the black curtain) and witnessed Cody sitting on the counter-tops and sneakily eating edamame where customer's food comes out.  As we continued to watch, we learned that Cody was actually eating food off customer's plates before he would bring the dish to the customer's table.  This is absolutely horrendous, disgusting and unacceptable so I decided to both photograph and film these acts.  I was praying that he would have been filled with food by the time our food was prepared so he would not eat off of our plates.  Cody did in fact eat off of our appetizer plate (edamame) and I was so upset that I decided not to confront anybody during our visit.  We did not touch our appetizer and the entire experience was horrific.  I am writing to tell you this now and I request that action be taken on this matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter.",

Hope they start expanding to more exotic types of seafood.     I've tried some of their other dishes like the noodles .  It's okay, but you would be better off going to a noodle shop.

I had ordered a Bento Box as I always do for lunch. They always substitute additional tempura instead of the California roll. When the food showed up, it had the wrong substitution. Apparently the owner or manager delivered the food to the table because when I tried to explain what was wrong, he told me substitutions cost extra. He then went into the kitchen and started yelling at the employees about it in a way that everyone could here.  I got up and called him out so I could tell him that it was really unprofessional to be yelling at the employees while there were people all around.  In doing so I used a swear word while explaining. (My bad!)  He proceeded to berate me for swearing and couldn't care less about his yelling at the employees.  We decided to leave at that point. I left a tip for the waitress and on the way out tried to thank her and explain it wasn't her fault.  The owner came up to me again and started getting involved again following me outside as I left. It did not end well. Will never go back! Really unprofessional!",

It was a Friday night so it was great that they still had happy hour going.I got ready and called my uber. I was a little surprised that it was a little out of the way from where all the fun night life was, but oh well, a  girl needed to eat. When I walked in, It was kind of dead, so it wasn't really what I was expecting being out , but the food and drinks were good. I sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails and wine along with my food. The server was very nice and attentive which was great. I didn't like that one of my drinks went up from the happy hour price simply because I asked for redbull with it. I think it went up like 3 dollars. Don't know if I would go again, but happy hour is good. :)",

The ice cream also did not taste like green tea. I would not suggest getting the mochi ice cream if you are actually going to spend $4.95 on it.",

The chef was not fun and interactive which was a debbie downer but the sushi made up for it.  My hubby had 2 diff deep friend rolls and they were excellent as well.  One if them was thr Las Vegas Roll.  Deeeelishious.    Our son had a spicy roll that had salmon in top with a light lemony sauce.  Holy cow it was good",

The service was quick and friendly. The miso was rich and flavorful and the house salad was more than your basic \"romaine, teeny bit of shredded carrots, and dressing\" - it had a variety of lettuces, cabbages, etc... I shared an order of the checkerboard rolls, the cucumber pop sushi roll things, and some salmon(sake). Everything was SO fresh. The flavors were spot on - and they were rolled right. Nice and tight, with nothing falling out when you picked them up. I cannot wait to go back!",

I'm so glad I did because now they are somewhere that I go to quite often.    They are usually pretty busy for dinner but the food is always good.  I'm a sushi lover, so I have tried a lot of the rolls, but one of my favorites is the Alaska Roll. It's salmon, avocado, and crab.   The best deal though is for lunch during the week. They have some great specials and when you check in you get a miso soup. I always get the two sushi rolls and you can pick from any of the basic rolls.  There are so many other options though if you don't like sushi or even fish.   The reason for me taking off 1 star is sometimes the service can be slow and during the work week when you're in a time crunch, that is an issue. The other issue I have, and I don't what it is with the spicy tuna roll but there is something about it that I don't like. I love spicy tuna usually so this was a disappointment to me.",

    "text": "(My Mobile Tip) Wow. These guys are seriously friendly! I have like 4 different menus to take back to work.    I ordered the lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki Box - $7.25.  You get a lot of food for the price you pay!    The chicken teri was not overly sweet or breaded.  The dumplings (goyza) or some may refer to this as potstickers, were steamed/pan fried.  J would have loved them.  I'm not really a big fan of potstickers.  The sauce was not the traditional scallion dipping sauce, but a soy citrus sauce.  Standard fare with the california roll and veg tempura.  I will say that the tempura was not greasy, which was a good thing.  And the house salad came with an awesome ginger dressing.    When I got back to work and started eating at my desk, I had quite a few colleagues ask where I went and that it smelled fantastic.  I'll have to admit, I did \"stink\" up the area.  It smelled awesome!    OH - I noticed that they have high chairs in their restaurant, so that tells me that the place is toddler friendly.  Which for a mom, that is very important.  Not always can you find a babysitter.    I'm sure J, Little C, and I will stop by one evening for an early supper.  :)",

Our waitress made it very clear by her rudeness and hey body language that she did not want to be there so we didn't bother her too much. The other servers were awesome and the food was OK.  The waitress (black haired girl named Carlee) never checked in on us and after we flagged her down to pay the bill she finally dragged herself over. We asked if we could get the bill split, and if not that's OK we could figure it out... She rolled her eyes and said \"I'm not sure, I'll see what I can do\". Then she came back with the split bill.  This is no exaggeration, this is verbatim what she said: \"Just to let you people know; it's standard protocol to ask the server to split your bill BEFORE you order!\"  We were speechless. One of our guys went to get the owner's number and while he was at the bar, Carlee came back and said unsolicitedly: \"I don't have time for this and it's at the server's discretion.\" Once again, the place was empty.  After a few other rude remarks from her, we left her 0 tip and felt badthat she ruined it for the other servers who were great.  SO- if you go here, go to the BAR! AVOID CARLEE!",

But I didn't know that he owns this place until I came in and devoured every sushi roll. haha.   We came after Happy Hours so our bill was on the pricey side. But looks like happy hour menu is not bad, drinks are pretty good. I love the yogurt martini, Korean signature. :)  Sushi was awesome. portion was very generous.High quality rice and fish, veggies were fresh.   The ambience is great. it's a huge restaurant! you have separated sushi bar area, dinning area and sport area, at least that's how I felt anyways.  I guess the only one thing I think Bei can improve is the hostess. The guy clearly didn't know what he was doing, I am sorry. He seems sort of frustrated even though the restaurant wasn't that packed when we got there. The bartender girl was nice, but obviously was irritated by the hostess, and that showed.   Good restaurant, good food. Perfect for a Friday night get-together. :)",

    "text": "We've been here twice and both times were extremely happy with the experience.   Our first visit was actually on Christmas day. We don't really celebrate and wanted something non-traditional that wasn't going to be ridiculously expensive. When we saw on Facebook that this place was going to be open, we made sure to head on over.   We got calamari and garlic, chili edamame to start. The edamame was amazing! By far the best I've had at a sushi joint. The calamari was ok. I liked that they used steaks instead of rings, but I really wasn't a fan of the batter. I would have preferred a tempura style, rather than the harsher, breadcrumb coating. I think it took away from the good piece of squid hiding underneath. But it was still good, and if you like calamari you'll like this.  For rolls we got the Blazing Alaska Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Golden Philly Roll. All three were so incredibly good! The sashimi used was fresh and flavourful, and the wasabi aioli wasn't overpowering, which was my fear. I'd highly recommend any of the rolls we got.  The second time we were there we went for lunch and got the roll combo (each of us). Two rolls and miso for $8.95 is a great deal! I know I got the spicy yellowtail with avocado instead of cucumber and eel and avocado. I don't remember what my partner got, but it was gone pretty quick, so it must have been good! Mine were great. I'm a huge fan of spicy yellow tail, especially if it's fresh.   I'd definitely recommend going during happy hour or lunch, but their prices aren't ridiculous so you won't break the bank during dinner. We'll definitely be back! There are a bunch more rolls that we want to try. We're hoping that they're open on Christmas again next year. (hint hint!)",

And every single time, it's got the best and freshest sushi on par with the quality you receive at ShinBay (without the wallet-breaking prices).   On top of that, the happy hour specials are awesome, the bar is awesome, and the servers and personnel are awesome (especially Chase and Jun).

My only gripe: I called in a take-out order last night and was told that orders were taking longer than usual and it would be a half hour. \"No problem!\" I said. I showed up almost exactly 30 minutes later, and I waited for at least another 20-30 minutes in the restaurant. I totally understand that it's a Friday night and things are busier than usual, but if that's the case week after week, plan for it! Hire a few more sushi chefs on the weekends to not keep so many people waiting. There were 4 other customers waiting for their to-go orders along with me. It was a bummer!  Despite the long wait, I will go back (but dine in).",

However, I was underwhelmed by the food here. I felt like there was too much cucumber in the spicy tuna, and the rolls with crab in them were too creamy. I think they had too much mayo in them. I'm sure a dismayed chef might say, \"they didn't even have mayo in them!\" But that's just my guess. Something was off about them. They weren't terrible, but not great either. The food had a really good presentation; it was just not very flavorful. They also forgot to bring out one of the items I ordered, which would have been far more forgivable if the food was good. I'll continue my search for an excellent sushi restaurant in the East Valley.   In sum, I give this restaurant a rating of \"meh.\"",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW - July 2017 (one star):  If I could give it no stars, I would.  After years of patronizing Bei, and having great service, we stopped in yesterday.  We had not been in for several months, and missed it.  Well, never again.  Our waitress was nice, a little on the sad side (she looked like she'd been crying), came to take our order, and my husband, who loves the bento boxes and always orders them, but doesn't like sushi, asked for his usual chicken teriyaki bento box, but asked for them not to give him the sushi roll, and just some extra tempura instead - this is something they have always done for him, no problem.  I really wouldn't even count it as a substitution, as they are just throwing in a couple of extra vegetable tempuras! He assured our waitress that it has never been an issue about this slight alteration, and she said that was fine.  When she brought our food, she had mistakenly omitted the gyoza (which he wanted), and left the sushi, which he didn't).  He brought it up to her, and that's when the manager came by.  He started berating us about no substitutions, and did not want to correct the order.  He was very rude about it, even as my husband politely explained that no one has ever declined his request before.  Finally, after a somewhat unpleasant exchange, the manager finally, very unkindly, said he would make the change this one time. Dude, it's a couple of vegetable tempura vs. one california roll, for a customer that's been coming in since you opened.   It gets worse. So after finally making this concession, the manager goes to the waitress, who is in the kitchen, but right inside the doorway.  He starts yelling and shouting at her, so loudly that whole restaurant can hear. I cannot remember the last time I felt this uncomfortable in a restaurant.  He went on and on and on, very loudly, and very derisively.  It was seriously one of the most abusive displays I have ever witnessed between a manager and staff in a dining establishment.  My husband got up and asked him to stop yelling at the waitress.  The manager was extremely rude to my husband, and at this point, he was fed up and just told the manager to stop effing being so rude and hateful to the waitress.  The manager refused to back down, and instead attacked my husband for his language. The irony of it all.  At that point there was no way we were going to eat there, so we left.  My husband tried to tell the waitress on our way out that the events were not her fault, and the manager once again stepped in and started yelling at my husband, following us out and continuing to harass us. I seriously have never seen this manager before, I don't know if he's new, but he seriously has no idea what good customer service and staff management looks like. I feel for the staff at Bei.  I cannot imagine that working with this man every day isn't some kind of hell.  Past review (2013)  My husband and I were running errands in the area on a Saturday (1/4/13) and tried to stop at DeFalco's for a quick bite...couldn't get in the door.  So drove down to Bei, someplace we'd been meaning to try.  Couldn't have been happier.  The food was excellent (I had the oyako don, and my husband had one of their bento box lunches with teriyaki chicken).  Our server was awesome.  The place was nicely decorated, with a great little bar area.  We will definitely be back, need to give the sushi bar a go this next time!",

    "text": "We have been to Bei twice now, and I have to say I hope this little sushi place stays around. The food has been really good on both visits, and I love that they offer a reverse happy hour, as my work schedule doesn't usually allow me to go to normal happy hour. The tuna lovers roll is amazing. Probably my favorite roll I have ever had anywhere! The sashimi prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay at a sushi restaurant. That's my only issue with Bei. The food is great, but the location and decorating/ ambiance of the restaurant aren't the best. The bar area is really dark- yet the dining room is extremely bright. I wish they could dim the lights a little more to give it a better vibe. I don't mind paying higher prices for quality sushi, but not when it's in a run down strip mall with tacky decorating. But we will return! And I probably just sounded super bitchy! Go here! Just don't expect a romantic setting of any sort!   Oh and they have a good selection of appetizers! Yum!",

    "text": "I was in the mood for sushi during lunch one day, but most of the sushi places in downtown Scottsdale are too loud/hip/fancy/expensive. I decided to try Bei, since it's in a modest strip mall and takes to-go orders.   I called in and ordered the Golden Alaska and Vegetable rolls with a side of edamame to go, and was told it would only be 10-15 minutes, even though it was around noon during lunch rush hour. I got to the restaurant and everyone seemed very friendly. The waiter said he was including miso soup in my order as well, and by some miracle the total only came out to $12 -- I looked at the receipt and saw they gave me some sort of sushi combination lunch special price, even though I didn't order anything from that menu.  The sushi was awesome, and it was the best free miso soup I've had. Usually the soup at other restaurants is just salty broth, but this had a lot of tofu and seaweed and was something I would actually pay for with my order. I will definitely be going back for lunch.",

    "text": "Excellent Addition to SoDo!  My boyfriend and I ate at Bei for the first time last night, and we were pleasantly surprised. We have been long time patrons on Sushi 101, but I believe Bei is equally as satisfying, if not better. The happy hour sushi menu is incredible. Their specialty rolls are the most reasonably priced sushi you will find at any happy hour. We ordered the Las Vegas roll, for just under $7, and it was phenomenal in appearance, size, and flavor! All of the rolls we ordered, including the basic spicy tuna roll, were very generously portioned, and I am not just talking about extra rice to make them appear larger. The fish was supplied in large quantities/cuts, and was fresh and flavorful.   When we first entered the establishment, we were immediately greeted and ushered in by the owners/managers with warm smiles and great attitudes. Our waitress Brittany was equally enthusiastic and good-natured, providing suggestions and attention to our needs. I also ordered the house sake, which came in a smaller sized bottle, but still amounted to three shots, and for $2.50, I have no complaints! The sake was the perfect temperature and went down smoothly. They also offer sake bombs for $6.95 during all business hours, instead of limiting the special to happy hour. There was live music when happy hour ended at 7, but the ambiance was relaxing and the tunes weren't overbearing.   I will definitely return to this establishment in the future, and recommend it to anyone looking for some great sushi in SoDo (SoSco? Or whatever they end up labeling Scottsdale south of Indian School...)!   P.S. Our waitress pronounced it as 'Bay'",

    "text": "Bei blew me away with a spicy tuna bowl that is both fantastically good but a True deal as well. The bowl is huge and not full of just rice there is a substantial quantity of spicy tuna along with avacado and some radish. I love to get it for a togo meal especially at the $12 price. It's pretty filling all by itself and most of the time I can get away with just that.  I have branched out and tried a few other things as well including the squid salad (solid) and the spicy salmon salad (fish was good but didn't mesh well with the dressing). I have also had a few of the rolls here and they were good but I can't remember which they were.  I have been impressed with the quality of the fish here and the prices. A nice plus is the free miso soup when you check in on yelp.",

    "text": "They're inching on \"meh\" territory now...  Took a friend and shared my praise for Bei.  We had overly bland service (I'm sorry, were we keeping you from something honey) which turned into bizarre service.  As we were down to merely nibbling on food, my dining mate ordered another cocktail.  Apparently we were expected to chug the drinks, pay, and then get the f outta there in 3 minutes.  Because as we continued to talk, every little item on our table was meticulously rearranged, talked about, and eventually removed.  Hours before they were to close, and with plenty of other folks in the restaurant (it was maybe 8:45), we both had to move around the waiters coming to take the condiments off the table, as if they were cleaning up and we had clearly overstayed our welcome.  If we hadn't just ordered drinks (cost money and can't be taken as to-go drinks of course), or it was late and near closing time, or if the place was packed, we'd have absolutely left.  But then, we also wouldn't have ordered more drinks. Altogether, I was embarrassed to have recommended this place for so long, when it left a majorly bitter taste in our mouths.  Ra may be corporate but at least they aren't dicks.",

However it was missing the traditional Japanese toppings such as the pickled vegetables. Other than that, it was really tasty and satisfying. Their combo meals really is enough for 2 people.   Their traditional bento boxes were also very satisfying. The chicken katsu was fresh and hot and not greasy at all.   Their hamachi Kama here was very affordable here at $8.95. It was moist and large enough to be eaten as a meal.  Their calamari appetizer which was prepared more like cutlets were also tasty. No tentacles here.    Service was excellent and fast.

    "text": "I was on the fence between 2-3 stars after my first visit, but the second definitely confirmed the 2star. Service was good, ambiance is casual, but food is very mediocre. There is plenty of parking in the lot outside, and there is happy hour daily.   Nigiri and sashimi: Uni nigiri was good, amaebi disappointing, sake nigiri mediocre, and sake sashimi good. Rice on the nigiris were a bit too densely packed, and the fish on top was sliced thinly and then pressed too forcefully into the rice.  Happy hour rolls: Very, very mediocre. I guess the happy hour price might seem like it's worth it, but I probably wouldn't order from the happy hour menu again. I had a Baked Alaska roll, which was room temperature and comprised of some tasteless fish with tempura powder sprinkled on top. The Golden Alaska was similar except the entire roll was fried on the outside.. and I could taste the staleness of the oil. The batter was deathly thick, and when I bit into a piece, I could feel my mouth coated with oil. My friends also ordered some rolls from the happy hour menu, which were equally unimpressive.  Teriyaki chicken: There was a lot of food in this entree, but it came out on a hot plate looking like a soppy mess. There were a ton of sliced vegetables, some sliced meat, and a pool of (questionable teriyaki) sauce. It also came with tempura, which was good.  Non-happy hour rolls: The first time I was here, I tried the Dragon and Caterpillar Rolls. Dragon was unmemorable with sparse unagi on top, and the Caterpillar was decently good but with mushy avocado on top. I liked the Scottsdale Roll, which had fresh fish and a good kick on the inside.  As a random tidbit, the miso soup here is surprisingly good. Unfortunately it's not good enough to redeem the other disappointing dishes.",

I'm a sucker for believing them. And the magazine-like photos of artful, flawless Japanese cuisine I expected? Not even close!  Everything we saw online was so far from our real life experience that we literally thought we had gone to the wrong restaurant. So bad.  First off, the interior of the restaurant looks like it hasn't been updated since before I was born. Not kept up, rough around the edges and basically sad and rundown. We sat at the sushi bar which was EMPTY (that should've been a sign).  And the older sushi chef who was \"helping us\" seemed like he hated life.  And us. He clearly was not happy to be there and anything was ordered was met with a loathing look.    We started with something easy-- shrimp tempura and Korean style chicken wings. Wings weren't bad but the tempura batter was overly thick, clunky and lacked flavor. Then the first round of sushi arrived. Bad. All bad. Even down to the chipped plates which were most likely harboring all kinds of other grossness. The fish looked like it was frozen then brought back up. Tough, rubbery, almost fake texture and look. It was the most unappealing fish is ever seen.  That was enough to cut our losses and find another sushi place right after. Never going back, never trusting Bei.",

And especially with Japanese food, it's all about the presentation.  Met my son here for lunch.   We both decided on the sushi combo with the spicy tuna roll.    The fish seemed fresh.   And the sushi was good, but it was the presentation.  (see photo)  I think it needs a little more color and garnish versus the lonely lemon wedge.   What do you think?  Plus, it didn't help that the workpeople were remodeling the bathrooms while we were there.   There was teeth chattering drilling going on.   Somehow, it didn't make for a peaceful lunch.   More like nerve wracking if you ask me.   I would think it would be a good idea to at least do it in the morning or afternoon when it is not so busy/empty versus during prime time dining.  I dunno.  Just my thought.     The server was pleasant and professional.   I dunno.   Might need to look for a different place to meet my son for lunch.",

I have also been on a HUGE sushi kick lately and was excited to find a sushi place I could add to my route.   When I first walked in I was immediately impressed by the overall vibe of the restaurant. I feel like every sushi place I have gone to the vibe has always been not very up to date and not well kept. I was very impressed by the cleanness and modern feel. We checked in on Yelp and received a free miso soup (thanks Yelp!) which was prepared very fresh and hot!  I really appreciated the variety that Bei had to offer when it comes to their rolls. I ordered a fried philly roll which I loved and felt it was so unique as well. Philly rolls are one of my favorites and the fried aspect made the cream cheese melted and super YUMMY.   The last thing I really loved about this place was the pricing. Often times sushi can be very expensive, however, we came on happy hour and it was so affordable! I did check the pricing and even if we didn't come for happy hour I still it was priced fairly.   I will definitely be back soon and am really glad I tried it!",

I just had the chicken yakisoba bowl (to go) and it was so bland that we had to add our own sauce. So stick to the sushi menu!  There is not much to see on the outside or inside of this place. Drink fountain could be updated as well-- the water they serve always has a weird taste. Decor could use some serious updating. BUT again decently priced and delicious sushi on happy hour!",

For example, my parents were in town and my mom cant eat sesame seeds and they remade her sushi right away with no fuss.   The rice bowls are very good and a great option if you are not quite in the mood for sushi.  The service has always been good! I have never had any issue with service here after going here around a dozen times. They are always attentive and consistent. The food always comes out fast.  Just a solid sushi fusion joint!",

Baked Alaska roll: the sauces are insane! Really good! Was well cooked and prepared. You would feel the hot spicy sauces from it with the fish. (10/10)  Spicy shrimp roll: It is a good roll. Not really spicy but shrimp taste good. Would recommend to eat it with spicy mayo (5/10)  Spicy yellowtail roll: Okay, not okay roll. Didn't match my expectations. Nothing special in this roll. (3/10)  Lad Vegas roll: comparing to other restaurants, this one is less favorable. Not really hot or spicy. But it was well prepared and taste fine. You'll feel everything in this roll. (7/10)   Miso soup was cold so we asked for another one and it was good. Overall the restaurant was very good in the signature rolls, but not too good in the regular rolls.  Friendly staff. Prices are affordable. Easy to locate the restaurant and parking lot is available for the most time.  One more thing we had is mango mochi and it was something new to me. But I liked it, and I recommend it.",

Wide open seating, separate bar areas, clean & bright.  Today I ordered lunch special(2 basic rolls with miso soup) ; Golden Alaskan roll & Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll, added Albacore nigiri. Quickly made, terrific presentation & plenty (full size, not half for lunch special)  The Alaska roll was really tastey & filling. The spicy Tuna was good but I've had better, but not bad for sure.  I will be here when I'm in the area, come meet me!",

Happy hour was decent as well.   Too much molasses in their eel sauce, could've just been an off batch- but throwing that note out there!  4/5 stars just simply because the sushi, although it looks phenomenal, seemed just par to other regular spots.",

Came on a Friday right when they opened at 4:30pm. Not to fanciest of places but the fish is solid and I am a purest when it comes to sushi so I stick with nigiri mostly.  Although I did not see Toro fatty tuna belly on the menu, I overheard someone at the sushi bar ordering it. I got a couple of happy hour specials: salmon and a spicy yellowtail hand roll. For my nigiri selections: amaebi fresh shrimp (came with the deep fried heads, legit), uni sea urchin, ikura salmon roe, mackerel, and spicy scallops. After my first bite I decided it was worth splurging on the fresh wasabi which is an extra charge but worth it.  My companion enjoyed her Chirashi and I gave her my complimentary miso soup for the Yelp check on. She also ordered the monster Rolls Royce roll which was deep fried and delicious.   I couldn't resist the veggie tempura either which I would definitely order again. All dishes were very, very good and affordable enough to eat on a weekly basis.",

Miso soup  Stuffed Mushrooms  Eggrolls  (3) amazing full size rolls that were delicious  All this the $34.  SERIOUSLY!!! We were told that they're happy hour prices are even better.   If you're looking for the most top notch sushi, this isn't the place.  But if you're like me and sometimes just need that sushi craving satisfied on a budget, look no further!

We got seated and placed our order right away, ordering a couple rolls of sushi. From the time we ordered our food to the time we received it, it was a 50 minute wait. This would be understandable if they were insanely busy, or got hit with multiple people right away. However, it seemed like a manageable amount of people, and most of them had already had food on the table by the time we sat down. During the wait, our waitress did make it a point to come to the table a few times and apologize for the wait. She was friendly, and her outreach was appreciated.  When we finally got our food, it was put in front of us, and then almost immediately taken back because the chef had forgotten to put \"crunchies\" on top of one of the rolls. Overall, the sushi was good, but not worth the amount of time we had to wait.",

Anyway, My dad, stepmom, husband, and I arrived here at around 12:45 and it was fairly empty. My dad and I split the noodle and rice bowl combo (this thing is huge... like 2 full entrees) with the spicy chicken noodles and the spicy pork bowl and . The husband had the beef teriyaki bowl and my stepmom got the tempura bento box. The gyoza was pretty standard... like the frozen type, not awesome. The salad had a fairly good ginger dressing on it, but too much of it... like a pool at the bottom. I thought the spicy chicken noodles were very tasty, just the right balance of sweet and spicy on thick noodles with vegetables and chicken. The spicy pork was even better, it was spicy and had the right amount of sauce to rice ratio... I liked both very much. The rest of the food was fairly mediocre. Anyway, I would consider going back for the items I ordered, but probably wouldn't get the other items.",

Overall the experience was great and I will be back, the sushi was good, and although we missed it the happy hour looked great.  The service was good we were greeted when we got there and sat at a nice table.  Miso soup gets a thumbs up, the salad (with that ginger dressing) gets a thumbs.  The sushi overall was good for what i expected from a strip mall sushi restaurant, and overall they beat my expectations prior to walking in.  The one item that caused the 4 vs 5 star review as the quality vs price of the sushi.  The prices were consistent with larger sushi restaurants but the quality was not equal.  Like I said we enjoyed it and will return but only during happy hour.  I don't mean to imply that the sushi was not good, I only mean it was not great.  They did get 4 vs 3 stars due to there very extensive happy hour menu much more then most sushi places.  Thanks again and we will see you soon.",

Bei isn't horrible just average leveling up there with stingray and Ra although less expensive. The sushi is Americanized but I appreciated their miso soup and gyoza.

Much better than the previous Thai restaurant that was here before. I ordered the Calamari appetizer. I believe the best Calamari appetizer I have ever tasted. Loved the crisp panko coating. I also had the Tootsie Roll. Very good and filling. My friend ordered the lunch special Mixed Tempura Box. Boy, did it look yummy! It must have been because he ate every bite. The Bento Box had so much food for only $7.95. The only thing I was disappointed in was the Seafood Dynamite. It did not taste fresh.  It had a strong \"imitation\" flavor to it. Besides that, it was very difficult to eat with chopsticks. I thought I was going to get something similar to RA's Scallop Dynamite. Very different. I do not recommend this appetizer at all. The experience was nice. Staff eager to please. Food delicious. Restaurant clean. I will come back.",

I know that's weird to gush about how they wrap it but it makes the difference when chopsticks can actually be useful. The staff are always so pleasant and make it a point to ensure you have everything you need. The monthly change to the happy hour food menu is nice because it forces you to try something new especially when on a budget.

I extremely was surprised by their stuffed mushroom. It was to die for!!! I loved it so much I had to order it twice.    The service was very pleasant.  Our waiter was very nice and had a great sense of humor.  They made sure my drink never hit the bottom and was very honest with their recommendation on items.  Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star is because I didn't try any nigiri.  It's very important to have fresh fish. Next time i go back I will try it but for now 4 star it is!",

For our sushi roll, we selected the Desert Sunset Roll- (Shrimp Tempura, Crab Mix, and Cucumber, topped with Yellowtail, Avocado, and Ponzu Aioli). Incredible. The highlight of the meal had to be the  Spicy Crispy Chicken. Phenomenal. If you're looking for a laid-back, casual spot with fantastic food, Bei will not disappoint!",

The food was INCREDIBLE at Bei and now I find myself craving it all the time!  I must say that it doesn't look like much from the outside.  It is in an old strip mall in the \"seedy\" side of Scottsdale but the food, service and atmosphere was top notch!  I highly recommend it!  They have a very inviting Sushi Bar and I like the fact that they always have some of sports on the bar flat screen TV.  Great place for a first date!  The pricing was perfect and I am always full and satisfied when I leave there!",

    "text": "UPDATE: I absolutely LOVE this place and have to admit I feel a little down writing about the last 2 experiences I've had, considering how I've become a die-hard regular. In hopes that you will not go through the same experience, I am writing this more as a warning. My boyfriend and I walked in there on a Saturday evening, we were greeted right away, as usual, by the kind Asian man, who we believe is the owner. We sat at  our usual high-top table, and waited...waited... waited for about 7 minutes (very unusual) for our server to greet us and bring us menus. When we came over, we immediately realized it was the same waiter we had the last time we had a negative experience. With no enthusiasm he brought us menus and left. Didn't offer us a drink until the second time he came around. After he brought us our drinks he went about his runs, and forgot about us. Finally, he came back to our table and ASSUMED we wanted the sashimi combo and was about to run to put it in when we quickly told him we were trying new things. We put in an appetizer (Salmon Kama), and 4 other rolls. Everyone else brought us our food instead of our waiter. What ENRAGED me is that I saw him SMOKING OUT OF AN E-CIGARETTE PEN BY THE BAR!!!! Also, we NEVER got our appetizer. Apparently, the waiter never put it in seeing that the Asian man had to ask us what we ordered. When the Salmon Kama came out, it was DISGUSTING. My boyfriend said it tasted as if they microwaved leftover fish and put it on a plate with cabbage. I have to agree. Only the times we've gotten this server (whom I don't even know his name, Hispanic looking man, with lots of arm tattoos and spiky hair) have been the times we have had bad service, his tip showed how unsatisfied we were, I even wrote him a little comment. Hopefully this will make him fix his style of waitoring to prevent driving customers away.  Aside those incidents, the place is still AMAZING.  what separates BEI from the surrounding sushi restaurants is their fish. I am always searching for good-tasting sushi spots where you can actually distinguish the fish by taste not just by sight. their fish is excellent, and tastes super fresh. comparable to several upscale sushi restaurants in Miami.   simply because of taste, I would choose this place over any of the chains in the Scottsdale area. their customer service is also impressive. everyone, including the owner, are extremely attentive and welcome you enthusiastically. they make sure to ask how your food tasted, and are open for suggestions. you can tell they're in the business because they love Japanese food and the art of sushi, not just to make money and turn it into a chain.   the only thing \"fishy\" (no pun intended) is the area. its located in a shopping strip in south Scottsdale that looks a bit shady during the day, a reason why it took me a little longer to try the place out. I was a bit skeptical.  inside is a different story. its very clean, well-maintained and you can tell they put in some work to remodel the place.  their specials are amazing as well! they have a few of their specialty rolls as part of their specials and their portions are never skimped. you need to try the BLAZING ALASKA ROLL its definitely my favorite roll on their happy hour menu.  if you're a sushi enthusiast, you MUST try this place. I guarantee it becomes one of your favorites",

Usually restaurants give you little fried rings and stuff but BEI gives you big long 3-4 inch pieces that are really, really good The sauce that comes with the calamari is great as well Both of the sushi rolls were very yummy and very fresh The rice on both rolls were sticky and the ingredients were good The shrimp tempura was really good too  Our server was very attentive and knowledgable of the menu  This isn't much of a bad opinion/con but the inside of Bei is kind of drab and could use some better interior decorations This didn't bug me at all since I know that it is a new place and I am sure once they get a bigger clientele and revenue that they will add some nice touches  Just a hint that don't let the interior fool you, the food is great and the service is great  I will be back BEI",

It's definitely comparable to some of the best places that I've been to in NYC.   I'm going to give it 5 stars because the food and drinks we're amazing. However, the managers we're too much. They asked me how my food was and I hadn't even had to time take a bite. I can tell they are concerned being a new restaurant but come guys... it makes you look desperate and it seems like people in Scottsdale simply aren't into that. By the time I had my 2nd piece of sushi 3 people had asked me if \"everything was alright\".  What's up with the yelling at everyone when they come in? Please stop.   Not sure if I'll return again next time I visit just because I felt a tad uncomfortable but I'll definitely consider it. The sojo drinks we're amazing too. I had two different versions of their Soju cocktails. Aloe and Yogurt. I saw other drinks on their menu and I must say, as a new yorker even, they know what they are doing at the bar. The bartender was also really funny and recommended some fun things to do in the area.",

Spicey Salmon salad looked and tasted funny to both of us.  Our last sushi dish came 35 minutes after our first. That is way too long guys.      We had been finished for 15 minutes and, had asked for the check when it finally appeared. We took it to go but, they didn't include any soy in the box so, we dumped it.  Sake was lukewarm.   Service was nice and friendly (thanks Katrina) and the squid salad was good.   If this was my only choice, I might try them again but, several high quality spots just 2 miles away.",

Its basically a large ball of crab with a little mushroom on it (think crab ball with hat) covered in panko and fried.  Sounds weird, but its actually pretty dang good.  Its a little tricky to eat but I'd definitely recommend trying it if you like crab.  We also had the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and one that I don't remember the name of..  They were decent, slightly too much rice and slightly off in the slicing but priced very right even without a special.

    "text": "The food at Bei is AMAZING - I am a huge sushi fan and I would venture to say that the sushi at Bei is the best I've had in Arizona. I came here with a date on Thursday for the first time and the place was lovely. They had live music and a very cool atmosphere; the decor is very pretty. We were impressed! We ordered several rolls, some basic, like the tootsie and the spicy tuna, as well as the dragon and ASU roll. All of them tasted amazing. The ingredients at Bei are INCREDIBLY fresh; the fish is the best quality I've had in AZ and there's a delicious balance and texture to all of it. The rolls themselves were also extremely well-made; very tight and neat. ALSO the green tea ice cream is to die for.   We will definitely be returning to Bei. The food came out quickly and, like I've been raving, it is of EXTREMELY high quality. The only blemish on the night was that while the service was relatively speedy, our particular waitress was distant and a little stand-offish; she almost never came to check on our table and when she did, she was cold and walked away almost immediately, before we could even tell her if we needed anything. Other servers who were around, whoever, were very kind and very pleasant, so I won't let that deter me from going back. Viva la Bei!",

Had the yellow tail roll which was bland and tasteless, the mi so soup was on the salty side but otherwise, ok. The seaweed salad was below average.

My friend and I got to the restaurant during happy hour around 8:50-9PM (keep in mind they're open until 11PM! So we were not the assholes that come in right before you close.). The manager sat us, and our server Carly came over after like 6-7 minutes of nothingness later.  When she approached our table, it was clear she had no interest in serving us (I can't fathom why not, considering we were the ONLY table). It took her like 10 minutes to bring us our drinks. Luckily our food came out shortly after in a timely manner. I ordered the sweet potato roll, and it was the last thing to come out. I don't know if you've ever had sweet potato before, but in general they're orange, so seeing that they were clear/translucent was too weird for me. I would have sent it back, but Carly decided talking to her coworkers and ignoring us, even after we were clearly finished, was a better idea! So when she finally came over, I told her she could take it back & that something about it wasn't right. She stood there questioning me like I was on trial about why it wasn't right/what I thought was wrong. If a customer complains, it doesn't matter what the problem was, just take care of it!! So she takes the roll back, while asking the chef behind the counter if he wants to try it to see what he thinks (which he did try it!). UHM WHAT, YOURE GOING TO EAT FOOD OFF OF A CUSTOMER'S PLATE?! I'm sorry, but that's a MAJOR health code violation!!!! She ended up sending the manager over after that, who then further questioned me, but comped it anyway. When we finally looked at the check, some of the dishes weren't correctly priced as they were on the happy hour menu. So my friend approached the counter where she waited.. And waited for Carly to come over so she could show her the receipt's error. When she decided to come help, she tried to argue with my friend over the happy hour menu, saying that \"well it changes every month.\" Well, excuse me, but it was on the menu, and my friend even showed her. She finally fixed it, and by the time she did, we had been waiting close to 10 additional minutes since the manager had been to our table.   We spent about an hour and half at this restaurant. Unfortunately, I won't get that time or money back. Do NOT waste yours. Let this be a warning!",

It's located outside of Old Town Scottsdale in an older strip mall with other businesses but the restaurant inside is quaint with high-top or booth type tables and a touch of fancy using cloth napkins and nice traditional Japanese tableware. There are other Japanese restaurants but Bei is one of the better choices worth venturing to an older strip mall just outside of Old Town Scottsdale!

    "text": "First time here, great experience. Service was fast and attentive even during happy hour. Atmosphere is very mellow, great after work spot to unwind. Happy hour is good especially on the alcohol side.  To be safe as first timers we started with our usuals and ordered the miso soup, cucumber salad, garlic edename, albacore nigiri and California roll. We wanted to get the full Bei experience so we ordered two specialty rolls as well, the Nebraska roll and the Lollipop roll.  I recommend it all but don't waste space in your appetite with a California roll although quite good, go for the specialty rolls, they won't dissapoint.  I'm not a roll fan so finding a roll that was not all rice was a delightful find. The lollipop roll has salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado and crab mix wrapped in cucumber and it is awesome.  My husband enjoyed the Nebraska roll which he enjoyed but I couldn't tell you what was in it. I kow it had spicy tuna, lol. Guess you'll have to go in and try it for yourself.",

The sashimi isn't slices of fish rather it is sushi - fish with rice. Price was reasonable but found much of the rolls were very much fusion in that it was very much dressed in sauces. Good for newbies to sushi but if you are wanting an authentic experience, this may not totally satisfy.",

Plus, orders at any sushi place normally come out pretty quick. Not today.  I arrived slightly before 5:00pm. Made my order of three vegetarian sushi rolls. Order came out at 5:27pm. All in all, about a 40min wait time. Seeing as how I didn't order anything crazy (just straight off the menu), nothing tempura, and no meat that needed cooked... why would it take 40 minutes to get me three rolls with vegetables on them?  The place wasn't busy - maybe 3 small groups of people in the restaurant. So I can't make myself say that they were just slammed and my order was down the list due the sheer volume of food they were putting out. No, they were just ungodly slow.  As I sat there I was wondering if I was dining in if they would have had me wait that long.  In any case, I guess I'm off to look for another sushi place in my area.",

I have been eating at this place for the past 2 weeks almost 3 times a week. It is seriously that good. I tried miso soup for the first time and it was delicious. Plus they gave me extra seaweed but they can hold the tofu. I like the fact that they have a rotating happy hour menu so you get a chance to try a lot of rolls. I definitely recommend trying the Vegas roll and the volcano roll.",

I came here on a Friday night and the place was popping.  We had to wait couple of minutes for my seat with some of my mates which is fine.  The place itself is decked out pretty hip and fun.    We ordered some food off the happy hour to start; edamame, Spicy Tuna, Volcano, and California.  Needless to say it wasn't anything special to start with.  Then again it was just starters, but in the end we didn't think it was something we couldn't get anywhere else.  We moved on with some entrees.  My mate ordered the Sashimi platter while I shot for the Goshujang Pork; a spicy marinated pork dish with white rice as a side.  It did come along with some tempura vegetables and a miso soup.  In the end, it was a lot of bang for your bucks I tell ya!  The entree definitely needed some texture since it was a mesh of tender pork, onions, and some scallions on a sizzling hot plate as a came straight out of the kitchen!  Overall, the food here is pretty good, but again nothing too special.  The place seems pretty cool for a quick happy hour bite and drink.  The service was pretty slow in my opinion since we had to wait for our edamame twice! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Since we used Yelp to find this restaurant, thought it only fair to provide a review. We arrived in Phoenix today and looked on Yelp for nearby sushi (our go to meal when traveling). We are staying near the university in Tempe so hoped to get away a bit. We saw the reviews and location in Scottsdale for Bei so headed there for dinner. We had a 7 PM reservation (made this afternoon) and were taken directly to our table and greeted almost immediately by our waiter.  While the restaurant seemed full and there were some people waiting, they seemed well staffed. Our waiter brought our water and drinks fairly quickly and then took our dinner order.  We ordered edamame as well as a sashimi sampler and a couple of rolls and were off to a good start. We got rice and some kind of sauce fairly quickly that we were told was for the sashimi and then didn't see our first order of food (the sashimi) until we were there for at least another 20 minutes.  We were surprised the edamame wasn't served sooner but assume our waiter forgot. It did eventually arrive and was hot and flavorful. The sashimi platter was served by a different waitress who dropped it off at the table without saying a word, almost walking away as she brought it before we could even ask her to maybe explain the dish a bit.  She also happened to bring out the two rolls we ordered and same story.  We weren't sure if she was just having a bad night or was always like that so we mentioned her affect to our waiter who then sent the manager.  When it comes to sushi and the work the chefs do to prepare, it would seem the presentation of the dish is at least a part of the experience and she clearly hadn't gotten the message.  He was extremely apologetic and said he would speak to the waitress. He came by several times again to apologize and actually took 10% off the total for the late food and sporadic service. We did notice the waitress was more interactive with other tables later so assume she took her managers advice.  The food was better than average when it arrived so that combined with the managers efforts to recover from poor service rate Bei 4 stars. FYI, did comment the restaurant was loud, mainly due to a woman at the table next to us who had an abnormally loud laugh.",

This of course is not True as neither my coworker or I would do this..... We asked for the receipt in the computer system because we were very confused and she was appalled we would ask for that. We apologized for the misunderstanding and even offered to square the bill away by putting $5.00 on the table. She stormed off banging dishes around and gave us nasty looks. A few minutes later we called her over and pointed at the $5.00 on the table just to hear her say, \"It's up to my manager\" and stormed off into the office with the $5.00 bill.....I don't appreciate being accused of dipping on a portion ($3.00) of the bill and won't be returning.",

The waitress was really nice and patience.  I will be coming back often , I wish I would have known this was here before now. I love this place, someone needs to do their marketing and get their name out there. So thankful I found them on Yelp. We are even making plans on coming back today with 12 people! :) Thanks Yelp for helping me find my new favorite sushi place",

The sushi was good the seating was good and it was fast. Literally we were in and out with no hassle. Just a great job. I don't get why their is bad reviews for family owned places. Show this place some support and go in and try their sushi! Wish I could give them more than just 5 stars lol.",

It wasn't until one guy came in and she walked up to him right away, laid down his silverware, menus, grabbed his drink order, gave him his drink, and still never came to us! We were sitting right next to him too! She just picked up our menus and walked away! It was at that moment that we decided to leave.

We have been searching for a place to fill Yen's shoes ever since we moved back.  We have found our new go-to sushi place.  Thank you Bei!    The cucumber salad was vinegar-y and delicious and the free check-in miso soup was nicely salty sprinkled with the crunch of scallions.   We ordered the Bei roll which was such a pleasant surprise.  Every piece of roll was a new adventure because they all have different fish toppings.  They have a lot of selections for happy hour rolls as well as drinks .  One suggestion: add Sapporo to the happy hour beer selections.  Why Kirin and not Sapporo?",

The place wasn't busy (maybe 5 tables of people sitting) and once we sat we looked at the lunch specials. My girlfriend had the 1 Noodle and 1 Rice bowl special. I had the Mixed Tempura Box.  Ok we were SHOCKED at how much food came out for that price!!!! Mine came with a salad, CA roll (4 pc), mixed tempura w/veggies and shrimp, and rice and it was huge! I didn't even touch the rice, CA roll or finish all the veggies and I am stuffed.   Her's came out and the Udon noodles bowl was HUGE (dinner size portion) with veggie tempura AND a rice pork bowl (dinner size portion). We were so full by the time we left.  Here's was $12.95 and mine was $7.95. You cannont beat that. Someone could easily split one dish for two people.  Service was also great like always.",

    "text": "As someone who eats a fair amount of sushi and goes through a number of cravings for good fish, I probably should have known better than to make my first visit to Bei on a Sunday night with a hankering in my belly. But so I did, and my results were less than spectacular.  First and foremost, the whole vibe of the place is a bit disjointed. You walk into a bar area with a couple of TVs playing, one of those cheesy neon chalkboards proclaiming the drink specials, and two types of music coming at you, one of which seemed to be fairly mellow, the other an overly bass-heavy offering of hip-hop and EDM.  Maybe I didn't do enough looking when I went in, but I didn't even realize this place had a sushi bar to sit at; as a party of one my attention was drawn to the bar which is prominent upon entering. There are some booths and then a wall that obstructs the view of most of the restaurant and the aforementioned sushi bar, which is where I generally prefer to sit.  My first concern was that I was presented with a rocks glass to drink my beer out of something I don't generally see. The service was decent if distracted at times, but I had no issues getting my order in with relative ease.   As for the food, everything just felt a bit off. Some of the rolls were overly wet, the bowl of rice was much too dry, and the fish--while decent--lacked that upper level taste and presentation. My sashimi was served on some sort of leaves laid over a plastic bowl of ice.  By the end of my meal, I was left trying to figure out exactly what Bei is trying to be, something that the restaurant itself seems confused by. Is it a RA-like hangout/clubby feel, is it a traditional Japanese restaurant, or is it a neighborhood place to come to, have a few beers and watch TV?  Instead of trying to be everything, I would rather Bei pick one, stick to it and do it well. The music and conflicting sounds were enough to have me not wanting to return; the food didn't do much to overcome that, though it wasn't the worst I've ever had and seems to show the most promise. The menu is a bit roll heavy, but that seems to be the norm here so I can sort of overlook that, but I would really love to see the sashimi and sushi given the majority of attention. I'd also be interested in exploring the rest of the menu to see how it stacks up.  A return to Bei is a definite maybe, though I fear it may only confirm my feelings that this restaurant is trying to be too many things and succeeding at none of them.",

Pricing is a bit higher than needed for what I got. Had I received thicker slices I would of said it was fine however that wasn't the case. I would come back here again but I would definitely order something else.",

    "text": "Mediocre Sushi/Japanese Restaurant  Meh.  We ordered dirty martinis to start, which came with old mushy olives. The martini itself was okay! Although, once the first thing you order doesn't taste fresh, your skepticism is turned on HIGH. For apps, we ordered the miso (free with Yelp check in) - which was simply put, good. But to be honest... I've never ever had BAD miso. The gyoza was plain and pretty flavorless and the sauce didn't help at all. I tried soaking it in wasabi soy sauce, which was just another fail.   The citrus tataki didn't taste as fresh as it looked, but was alright. I wasn't a huge fan of the thin slices or the fact it didn't somehow to taste citrusy at all. The Las Vegas roll was okay, no complaints.   The one thing I do commend was our server! In dark times, she was a star! She was attentive and quick. She quickly brought out our orders and noticed once the other server didn't bring our dishes out together and fixed the issue. She also gave us free a free Mochi for spending over $60! (I did enjoy the mochi and whipped cream) Thanks Mellisa for being our favorite part of this whole place ... shine bright, shine far, you're a star!!! (the one star)",

The small salad they give you with your bento box was ok. Way too much dressing for my liking-there was a small lake of dressing at the bottom of my salad bowl when I was done eating the lettuce. The miso soup was really good and hot! Not lukewarm like some miso soup you get at other spots.  The sushi and bento box was great! The bento box was big and had plenty of food in it!

The sushi burrito is great, the sushi is great, the miso soup is amazing, the ramen is great. I've loved everything I've gotten here, especially the spicy tuna stuffed jalapenos and the Bei special roll! Highly recommend",

We meant to order the baked Alaska, and when the Alaska came we asked our waitress about it. Obviously everyone feels awkward when a miscommunication has happened, so we tried to be friendly and kind. Unfortunately she took a very accusatory stance and said \"I checked with you twice\". We accepted that we had incorrectly marked which roll we wanted, but this was our first time here. Additionally, she gave us a roll we did not order, on a plate with a roll we did order. We also asked about this, to which she responded \"it's fine; it's already here.\" We began to eat the roll we did order off the shared plate. Moments later, she came back, took the plate, Removed the roll we did not order, and brought the same plate back. She then gave the accidental roll to the table next to us (after we had already eaten off that plate... health code?!?). Our waitress left a bad taste in our mouths. Edit: we cannot 100% confirm that she gave another table our reject roll, but the evident definitely to points to it",

We walk in and it was not what I expected - picture a bar type atmosphere, dark, and not very classy - but it's cool, I wasn't looking for a five star restaurant anyway. There were two big groups of people seated at the bar loud as hell - maybe they were drunk or maybe they were just happy since it was a Saturday night, but I didn't mind much.  The restaurant had a late night happy hour. We ordered the shrimp dynamite roll and Nebraska roll. Both were good, but the rolls tasted pretty similar to each other. The check came to $25. The service was quick, easy and painless.",

    "text": "I come here pretty often (mainly because my friend loves it), but also because the happy hour prices are very fair. It really has been hit or miss for me. The garlic edamame is delicious. The gyoza lacks flavor unless doused in the sauce it comes with. I LOVE the crunchy calamari roll, which I always add cream cheese to. It is always tasty and well cooked. Last time I was there I ordered both the spicy salmon and the spicy tuna rolls for HH. The spicy tuna didn't taste very fresh, but was well flavored otherwise. The spicy salmon was basically flavorless. It tasted like I was eating cold rice and mush. I wouldn't recommend that roll, but maybe it was a bad day for the salmon. Service is also a hit or miss. There are times I have come in and been served everything in a timely manner, but other times, I am waiting 15+ minutes for the check when all of the food on the table is gone. All in all, it is good for the price and I would recommend coming here for happy hour. Otherwise, pay a little more somewhere else for fresher sushi.",

My boyfriend and I ordered the Spicy Alaska Roll and Scottsdale Roll, Beef Teriyaki entree, and the chicken rice bowl. We didn't finish either roll or any of our main dishes. I'm not a huge fan when dishes are soaked in sauce, drenching the rice. I thought rice was supposed to be white?   You know when you usually eat sushi and every bite you should get that \"oh-my-God-this-is-f'ing-amazing\" as you're chewing? Ya... that failed to happen. I just picked it apart. Overall just very disappointed in spending $60 on this meal. It was all just so damn bland.   As my boyfriend so eloquently stated, the hotdogs at the game were better than this place. Well said my friend, well said.",

Again, I am no ramen expert but I am usually slurping away to glory until the last drop. I also like their ramen portion. It's just right. I always feel guilty leaving behind so much ramen at other places. Of course, I wouldn't box up ramen. Sacrilege!  Ask for their secret \"red spice powder\".

Ordered the Alaskan role as the server had recommended it, needless to say it was not good. The spicy tuna tasted fishy and the roll was just not good to the taste. Upon sending it back the restaurant owner JT came over to ask me about why I didn't like it. I politely responded with what I thought and left it at that. He then proceeded to ask me if I had ever been to his restaurant and explained that all spicy tuna recipes are different. I told him that was fine and said I didn't like it. A few moments later he returned to our table to continue on about spicy tuna recipes and how many people order that role and never complain. I couldn't believe this fellow was arguing with me about a roll.   When the bill arrived I asked the server about the charge - I didn't care about the cost, but the principal. JT came over and explained that his restaurant policy is that if you order it you pay for it. This roll was recommended by the server, and I explained that when something doesn't taste good most restaurant owners would encourage guests to say something. He argued with me so much so that I had to tell him that he was being quite rude and I asked that he please run my card five times. He made a huge scene and would not stop talking about his policy. I would never recommend someone come here - Heaven forbid the food is terrible, management doesn't care because you ordered it and it isn't their fault.   Buyer beware. Avoid this place.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to Bei for quite some time, but decided to stop by the other day to satisfy my craving for sushi. I got there just in time to order from the lunch menu before the kitchen closed until dinner. (The restaurant closes each day at 2:30, and reopens at 4:30)   It was just a few minutes past 2:00, but my server was helpful enough to let me know that it was last call for lunch orders, and when the kitchen closed, that was it, and she wanted to be sure I got in under the wire.   I made a quick decision to have the Sushi Combo, which was miso soup, tuna, salmon, yellowtail and shrimp nigiri, and a California roll or Spicy Tuna roll - which looked like a good deal at $9.50. For my roll, I wanted to have a spicy tuna hand roll instead of the standard roll. The server said that was no problem. I also asked it she could be sure it was spicy, and she indicated again, no problem.  My miso soup arrived within moments. It was pretty basic, but met my needs. My sushi also arrived quickly. The fish tasted fresh, and even the shrimp, which I am not generally a big fan of, was good. My spicy tuna hand roll started off ok, although I could see, and taste with my first bite that siracha had been used to supply the heat.   I don't have an objection to siracha, but in most spicy tuna I have historically had, the heat has been supplied by chili oil, which adds heat without the tuna flavor being drowned out as it was with the siracha in this case.   By the time I got 1/2 way into my hand roll, all I could taste was siracha. I had to drizzle a bit of soy sauce with wasabi into the roll to offset the overwhelming siracha taste with a different and less sweet element.  I know the next time to request that siracha be kept to a minimum, and that chili oil be used for heat. I believe Bei will be able to accommodate that request.  On this visit, everything happened so fast that I was finished with my lunch in about 15 minutes. My server assured me that I could take my time, and that only the food order was time sensitive, but since I was finished, I requested my check anyway. It was a pretty quick lunch - in and out in 20 minutes!   Still, I will be going back again soon. The service was great, and Bei is accommodating. I'll bet they can prepare me exactly the spicy tuna roll that I want!  Also, my prior meal with them was excellent.  For the money, my lunch was a great deal! Next time, the Sashimi Combo!",

K & I ordered a lot of food as K had been camping for the last five days & was quite hungry. All of the appetizers we had were very yummy. Because of our hunger & it happening to be happy hour we ordered 9 different types of sushi! There was only one of the 9 that was not to our likening.  We were very pleasantly greeted & seated, but am sad to say our waitress & overall service was less than enthusiastic. It is really unfortunate because we are a family of sushi lovers, & I will now hesitate to return, even just for take-out.",

The owners, JT and June, are extremely welcoming and always smiling. The sushi is very fresh and of high quality. Bei has happy hour twice a day and the happy hour menu changes monthly which is something to look forward to each month. Try the Pure Roll - you won't be disappointed!",

I chose the cucumber salad, which was delicious and well-balanced (not too acidic) and the Big Time Roll, which was delicious. I was also thrilled that they did not put the extra sauce on the roll, as I usually like less sauce than others. Overall, this was absolutely the right choice and I would order from them again!",

Entrees have often come out at varied times (many minutes).  Little things like refills on tea.  They take glass but then don't bring a pitcher or a new glass and clear the old glassware.  Can't say enough  though about food; exceptional entrees and sushi.",

Price was good - $8-9 for this per order.  have yet to check it out for happy hour but will be back.  hope they pick up more business - it's right next to Frashers but kind of obscure in a no-named little strip mall.  our server was very nice and attentive and the food came out in a timely manner but no one else was there.  bar area seems large and they have TV's for sports!  asparagus veggie roll was delish!!!",

I am not what you would call a foodie but I appreciate good food and think I have good taste. I purchased a couple of things to go and was very, very impressed even though most food does not translate as well when ordered to go. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken entree and shrimp tempura and they were excellent. I am chomping at the bit to go eat in the dining room because if it was this good to go I can imagine it will be even better to eat in. I live very close to this restaurant and do not want to see it go away so please take my review with a grain of salt but give it a try and I will bet you will be impressed.",

The food was fantastic, the happy hour prices were great and the staff was friendly. I sincerely appreciate the work ethic and grace the Asian culture presents with food. Constantly checking up on you, having your plate removed as soon as you finish your food. It made us feel welcome and taken care of.  My only complaint is the Nigiri is a little on the high side price, but its worth it :)",
