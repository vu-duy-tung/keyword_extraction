    "text": "Apparently Haji Baba isn't open on Sundays, so we decided to hit up Tasty Kabob instead of calling it off and heading home. The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld.   But there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.  Halfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too.   Although the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.  So I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish.   I didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.  I'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine. And the food isn't squeaking out any more stars from me.",

Had the Chelo Kebab Koobideh plate and paid the upcharge to have Baghala Polo (a delicious rice pilaf with dill and lima beans) with it instead of plain white rice and wished I hadn't.  The dill rice tasted mediocre and the whole time I ate, I was hardcore eyeing the platters that went by with white rice and salad.  Would definitely order differently next time.  We also had the hummus, which was perfectly tasty, but nothing to write home about.  My lunch companions who ordered sandwiches received a side dish of bagged potato chips, which seemed both superfluous and budget.  The Frank Sinatra and Rat Pack-esque music playing in the background was also a little odd.  Although I did like my meal for the most part, I'd probably visit one of my other favorite Persian spots in the valley for dinner service instead of here.",

What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me.

The kabobs have been a little tough here and there but not so tough you can't eat them. I love the Barg and the Gourmet Sobzy. Persian basmati rice is one of the wonders of the world and Tasty Kabob makes it so well that even my husband the non rice eater cleans his plate here. Topping things of with persian ice cream always ends the night with a smile. You can also take a bag of tea home with you to brew your own which is awesome. Ask the owner what the chef mixes in it to make it taste so good. She told me but I can't remember beyond.. I love it. There is rarely a wait here and always clean. The more we go, the more I want to return. This is a must try for those who like to try new types of food but great also if you bring a stick in the mud that likes meat and potatoes.  You will get rice instead but I gaurantee even a cowboy will love the Barg.",

But, the three stars is more about the food than the service, if it was including the service it would be more like 2 stars.   Started out with hummus and was disappointed by the very small portion.  Not even enough for 4 people to share more than one dip.  Which seemed strange  when the rest of their portions were too large.   But the meals were pretty tasty. The rice portions are huge, and so were the sandwiches. My eggplant plate tasted better the next day as leftovers.   The cheesecake slice was also large enough to share with everyone, mango was a nice flavor, but it was frozen at some parts which didn't appeal to me.",

Pulled out the trusty iPhone and found this place as an alternative. It's a shame that now I'll probably never have Haji Baba with this place being right up the street.   My girlfriend and I each had the vegetarian platter with hummus, eggplant borany and tabbouleh. The hummus was average, the tabbouleh was above average, and the borany was OH MY GOD amazing! I don't know exactly what it is and I don't need to know - all that matters is that it's delicious. It's the perfect creamy texture with a garlicky eggplant flavor. It also came with a dollop of yogurt and figs (I think...it was some kind of creamy mayonnaise looking sauce and shreds of something tasty.)   Service was attentive and polite - not a single eye roll or sigh when I repeatedly asked for cups of ice. One dining out pet peeve of mine - they have soda cans (seriously...my work cafeteria has a soda fountain - it can't be that difficult/expensive to maintain) and I couldn't quite get my drink cold enough.   Portions were big enough to share (we know for next time) so we took our leftovers home and had a pita picnic for dinner that night.   Worth the drive from downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "The first thing I'll remark upon is that Tasty Kabob has the most fabulous saffron ice cream ever!  I have tried several types of different ice creams like green tea and nattou (fermented soy bean) and have gotten close to lobster ice cream (in Bar Harbor), but have never tried the delicious freshness of this nutty, flavorful treat.  I am not really fond of the name of this restaurant but it is what it is-- a tasty kabob.  And so, that's we ate.  At the start of our meal, we had some wonderful caffeine-free tea (chamomile, I believe), which was brought out in a steaming pot and was perfect.  Lovely for two girlfriends who hadn't seen each in three years and needed a good chat.  We shared a stuffed grape leaf appetizer and I must say that I have never been disappointed by them.  The tzatiki type sauce was yummy, too.  For dinner, my friend had the lamb kabob and I enjoyed the cornish hen kabob.  I was a little saddened that her lamb was a bit tough and that mine came as hen on the bone, but the dinners were cooked farely well.  They also came with generous portions of rice and salad.  As I was eating my hens, I incessantly dipped the meat into the tzatiki; they needed something more.  The waitress was very attentive and the decor was attractive.  Again, I think the name and the huge sign out front were a little corny, but good Middle Eastern food is hard to find and I think Tasty Kabob does a fine attempt at it.",

    "text": "Let me clarify, the 3 star rating is only because of the lack of too many vegetarian options. I say this bcs with the kind of food they serve they can easily pull off other good veggie options like their competitors. I was forced to order an appetizer for dinner when I was so hungry, for the lack of options and a side of saffron rice, which wasn't as good as say med fresh grill or Phoenician cafe!   My friends absolutely loved their meat dishes, but love to c some better veggie options. Like the name suggests, I m sure u guys can make tasty veggie kabobs if u can :) the pistachio ice cream was good. Check the photos section for some pics I posted.   But the service was good and the owners were very nice to us too, maybe bcs we were in a big group and seems like they felt we were from some review team, hence the extra love(maybe? :p). They were also keen on splitting the check without much fuss, even though they screwed up a few checks, maybe bcs we were in a big group.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when servers come to take away your bowl of food before you are done eating, agreed there were only some tiny scraps in there, but that is always uncalled for. Happened here but no biggie. As I said the rating is solely for lack of too many veggie options",

My wife had the fescnjun which is roasted walnuts and pomegranate spread, she loved it.  The tazaki sauce was great just not much there.  We also had the humus appetizer which was very good and came with lots of sliced pita bread.  I should mention that my Gyro plate did not come with pita.

    "text": "Rude owner has alienated us as customers. I have frequented this establishment many times for lamb kabob or lamb shank, both of which are delicious. I have enjoyed this restaurant as a regular patron over the years. However, I will never visit again after my most recent experience. My husband and I, along with another couple, stopped in for a scoop of their delicious pistachio rose water ice cream. The owner was angry and dismissive once he realized we were not ordering a full meal, telling us that he is \"not an ice cream shop.\" We offered to leave, but he said he would \"allow us to order the ice cream,\" but told us that cost of the ice cream meant he was losing money on serving us. Let me be clear that a scoop of ice cream costs $7.00, which we were not complaining about. My friend (who was with us) is a chef and understands ingredient costs, but agreed that discussing this with customers is unheard of. We should be able to walk into a restaurant and order an item a la carte.  Also, the restaurant was empty except for one other party of four people. It was not as if we were taking a table from someone who was waiting to eat. After reluctantly serving the dessert, he continued to explain in a rude manner why he did not like serving dessert without an entree and how he was making an exception. It made  the entire experience extremely uncomfortable and unenjoyable for my husband, my friends, and me. He then gave us the check  ($30 for four scoops of ice cream, so not a small bill) and sarcastically thanked us for understanding and told us he would not make an exception next time. This will not be an issue since none of us plan on returning. We tipped the waiter, who looked extremely embarrassed. It was not his fault that the owner was so rude.  Other reviewers have written that the owner pays to remove negative reviews, so it will be interesting to see if this review is even published.",

Something must be wrong with THIS place.  But, because I organize a monthly \"World Tour Lunch\" group, I wanted to go to this particular restaurant because it is an Iranian restaurant...    Not a surprise,  it seems like each one of us ordered some form of a kabob/combination plate.  I also ordered the veggie soup, Aash, and the Baklava.  I was so surprised to find that the food in this restaurant tasted so good.  I enjoyed every bite of the tender and succulent chicken and the lamb.  And of course, the objective of most of us who are doing the tour is to also try each other's food, and I enjoyed the samplings of other folks food too.  So, I've come to this conclusion, this place has to be the best kept secret in Tempe!  I can't see how people will walk pass Tasty Kabob and go to the neighboring establishment  when this food is awesomely fantastic and prepared by a talented kitchen.  In addition to the the food, I was so very happy with the service!  Any place that willingly accommodates my strange requests for lettuce in place of rice/pasta in their dishes is generally okay with me.",

    "text": "As a frequent visitor to the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is can't miss spot for me.  I have been eating here for about 10 years with no complaints.  I can't find something on the menu I haven't tried and loved.   I wish I liked closer to make this my go-to spot.    This is a local family owned business, unlike most restaurants nowadays.  The couple works the kitchen and the dining room everyday they are open to bring traditional home cooked meals.  As I spend half my life in airports, it is a refreshing change.  I have spent many hours speaking to them as a solo diner and can't wait to see them next time I am in town.    Make sure to leave plenty of room as the portions are large and you will want to devour all of it.  The \"barg\" is actually beef filet that is cut to small pieces, so it is super tender and flavorful.  So while the price might look high, its for top quality meat.  Leave room for Persian ice cream, as it is not like any flavor you have ever tried.    I routinely bring customers here for dinner because of the inviting atmosphere, great food and excellent service.  I even have many of my customers returning without me and thanking me for introducing them to this restaurant and Persian food.  The only place I know to get better Persian food is in my mom's kitchen... but that is on the other side of the country.      Stop by and say hello to the owners for me.  If you start a conversation with them, they will treat you like family!",

We tried the lamb kabobs, with veggies and rice, and hummus; We were not impressed.  The atmosphere/decor is nice and it's quiet, so it's a good place to take a date or friends and family if comfort, pretty setting, and the ability to hear each other are important.    One delicious treat that should not be missed is the homemade pistachio and rosewater ice cream!!  My mother, a very picky eater and hard to please, speaks of this not-too-sweet sweet treat often.  I'm actually feeling guilty that I haven't brought her back here.  We'll give the food another go- if it's another miss, we can always have our entrees at nearby Pita Jungle or the wonderful Haji-Baba, and then head over here for the delicious ice cream (it comes with these cute and tasty sugar cookies that add a nice crunch to the treat)!",

Not sure which one of these establishments was here first but these two places RIGHT next door to each other are for sure rivals. Tasty kabob is a family owned restaurant though, and the quality and taste of the food completely represents that. Everything was freaking delicious. Let me break it down for ya right quick folks::  ATMOSPHERE: place is decorated really nice inside, perfect place for an intimate dinner. They had Persian music playing as well which i loved. The decorations, music and food all flowed together wonderfully. SERVICE: top notch. The owners are their walking around (i assume it's them..you know they give off that owner-y- vibe) and our waitress was just a little basket of knowledge and sunshine! FOOD: hummus was one of the best i have had. Menu is fairly large and honestly everything looked good. We had the chicken kabob and steak kabob and the meat was REALLY tender and flavorful. Order came with a MASSIVE amt of yummy rice. (also have the option doing 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad if you desire). They also did a special order for me which was not on the menu. wanted a special vegetable Kabob and they whipped it up just to my liking.. gotta love that! didn't have room for the ice-cream but hear its delish! DRINK: wine and beer- nice selection PRICE: reasonable. Two people, $52. pretty good for apps, two drinks and two entrees.   give this underrated place some of your time one day if you happen to be in the area, i highly doubt that you will be disappointed.",

(This was around dec 09). I don't think the person serving me was a member of the serving staff; she was likely the owner or the manager, and treated me like some beggar who came asking for scraps from the street.  - I was seated and pretty much ignored for atleast 15 minutes, no water, no nothing.  - When my order was taken, it was with such contempt, I thought I was being served by the queen of Iran . I ordered my entree, but before I could add a drink, she decided that she could only write so much on her piece of paper, so she walked off.  - She was really nice to the 8 person table next to me, filled with well dressed old people. I presume she gauged my youth, my lack of a tuxedo, and solitary presence as a sign that I was not going to be a major contributor to her profit that evening. Of course, I decided to fulfil her expectations and did not tip her.   That was a fearful dining experience, and God help those who work with her, especially the servers/kitchen staff.  One of piece of advice for the management of Tasty Kabob: if you are going to behave like Persian royalty, don't go into the 'service' sector, where you have to serve customers. Now I understand why the Shah of Iran was overthrown in '79. It was probably because he had siblings like you whose obnoxious behaviour drove the humble Iranian people into the arms of raving extremists in the Islamic Revolution.   Friends, I would recommend Persian Room in North Scottsdale instead. Their clientele is also well to do, but they welcome every one, even folks like me, with kindness, good service and good food, and I happily pay the higher prices.",

(more humorous than anything)  Otherwise the food was good, a little pricey, but big portions to match.  The Grape leaves were amazing, the meat seasoned and cooked well over that amazing rice.  The gyro, very filling and fresh.  I have grown to appreciate things that tend to not be greasy and leave you feeling great after the meal, and this restaurant definitely will have you leaving feeling great.",

First off, the quality of customer care and service here is wonderful.  It is very family like business and the owners are very sweet people.    The food here has always been delicious and still is.  Last night, we started with hummus and grape leaves as appetizers. I love love love the grape leaves here . I could eat the appetizer by myself! The hummus is amazing too, don't get me wrong.    For drinks:  I got the traditional hot tea they brew and it is so warm and delightful. It was perfect for a cold winter night in the Az.     For entrees : In general, the portion sizes are quite large, so be prepared to eat a good amount or ask for a to go box. The quality of the food served is superb. I have gone to higher paying restaurants and have not gotten the same quality  My father has always ordered the Lamb shank and devours it! He says it is amazing. I like getting the chicken and lamb kabobs.  Recommendation: Ask for half rice and half salad , unless you want rice for days which is cool too . To finish I recommend there ice cream it is light and flavorful! So thank you Tasty Kabob for treating us to another wonderful meal.!",

    "text": "FIRST VISIT July 2016. My husband and I were very hungry after a long day out. I've never had Persian food before, and was very pleasantly surprised. He had a shish kabob chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed a lot, and I had the lamb shank. The lamb was delicately spiced but quite flavorful, reminiscent of Indian food but not overpowered by the heat of hot pepper that's so characteristic of Indian cooking. It's really hard to describe this meal because there's nothing like it. I loved the sauce that the lamb was cooked in, and the lamb was incredibly tasty.   We also shared a salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint. The vegetables were cut up very fine, which liberated the flavor. Everything was fresh, not just the mint. The rice that came with the lamb was loaded with dill and flavorful as well. There was a lot of it.  The owner and his son were very attentive. They gave us extra iced tea and let us linger at our patio table far into the afternoon (we were the only customers in the place). There was so much food, we took some home in a doggy bag.  Ordinarily, I'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars, only because I ate there only once and don't have a lot of experience with it. We plan to return and try other things on the menu. The owner is kind and capable, so I hope he gets lots more business.  SECOND VISIT May 11, 2017:  I downgraded my review to 3 stars after my second visit. The food was mediocre. The shish kabob was cooked too much, very tough and almost inedible. A young man (the son?), rather than the owner (the father, I believe), waited on us, and the difference in service heavily declined. The food was unremarkable. The salad, which I'd assumed would be a Persian staple of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint, cut up small, consisted of a few leaves of iceberg lettuce and tomato slices. I don't need to spend big bucks eating out for what I can easily throw together at home.   Also, this is an aside, but my dining companion, who ordered a sandwich, got a package of potato chips on the side (as he did the first time). This is cheap, reminiscent of vending machine fare. Surely a place that calls itself an authentic Persian restaurant can do better.",

As soon as we entered inside the owner started barking at us \"that's it's going to be a wait!\" when half the restaurant was empty. We said it was alright and sat down. We waited for about 10 minutes and gave a gesture to the waitress for some water and the owner yelled \"I told you it's going to be a wait!\" I was honestly shocked by how she said this. We told her we just wanted water. She was silent and the waiter then brought us water...But honestly it totally ruined the vibe of the dinner. Have some respect for people who are supporting your business. She then proceeded to attend to all of the tables in the restaurant except ours, which she visited when we were leaving. She then told us she acted the way she did because she \"perceived\" our mom was giving her a \"mad look\" and began to justify her behavior. She ultimately compensated 1 appetizer because she knew she acted erratically. We ran out of there and will never be back. Thanks!",

On a mission to review every Persian restaurant in California and around it's borders, I discovered Tasty Kabob. I've eaten here many years ago but have forgotten about it untill I went back with a friend of mine who lives in Phoenix. Tasty Kabob Is not a fancy restaurant, the owners spend their time and energy creating good quality, authentic food. The yogurt is thick & Maast-o-Moosir Is made fresh, daily. The quality of meat is always exceptional & the Barg Kabob always comes perfectly cooked. Juicy, tender, yet slightly crunchy on the upper 'crust'. It's just absolutely fantastic! I had lunch here many times over the years and never been disappointed.",

There was 2 waiters (college kids) and the owner (she was running the cash register) and came to talk to the other couple about how her place might be closing down.  I am from out of town so I guess irrelevant but anyway, even though the food was okay - the service and atmosphere was horrendous.   The British couple sitting in there were mid meal and the man with the heavy accent was clearly plastered. He was on some crazy rant about how \"STYUOOPID\" Americans were because they didn't support this business or Persian food in general. He kept telling the owner that Americans only like carbs, fat, and sugar and were very stupid people. He kept going on his rant and the owner, agreeing with him kept saying that she will probably go out of business  and it wouldn't be because of the food.   Well let me tell you sweetheart, it might be a combo of both customer service and food. The chicken kebab was dry and obviously reheated. The rice was flavorless, and the onions were also old. The only good thing was the fire roasted tomato and the beef kebab. ($22)  Now, the reason you might lose business is because of drunk, annoying pricks like that man who came into rant about how much he hates American's and America and you agreeing with him. Funny how he claimed to have money and then drove off in his red 1998 Ford Fiesta. Maybe with all his money, he can invest in your business.",

This combo allowed us to sample a little bit of 3 different types of meat: beef sirloin, chicken kabobs and Koobedieh (kind of like hamburger meat, but on a skewer).  This place was kind of dead on a Sunday night with just 2-3 other tables being occupied...kind of sad considering the excellent food. The atmosphere went along with the drab classical music soundtrack playing throughout the restaurant.  The only part of the experience that kind of killed the mood, the owner (who was also our waitress and cashier) was giving direction to a seemingly new bus boy and we could overhear her reprimanding him for doing something wrong. However, we could also hear her praise him when he did something right. Either way, this conversation should be out of earshot of the customers.  At the end of the day, the food is why we came here and would definitely go back again.",

We just ignored that. Later, after we asked for check, she came by and dropped the check on our table without any eye contact and saying anything. I find her behavior very odd and would not come back here.  Beside this experience the food was good and the waiter was very friendly.",

Homa and Hossein are wonderful and take great pride in what they do.  Over the past few years, I have invited several friends and co-workers to go with me and they all enjoy it as much as I do.   As far as the food is concerned, I love the chicken kabob.  You will not find better chicken anywhere.  It is cooked to perfection, tender, and incredibly flavorful.  The lamb and filet are also phenomenal, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  Their sandwiches are an amazing value and the hummus is amazing.  I have specific \"go to\" items usually involving chicken and rice (and I always get an extra rice to take home because it is that good).  After 20 years, and probably eating there at least once a week, I still crave Tasty Kabob.    The restaurant is incredibly clean, well decorated, comfortable, but also classy.  The ambiance is perfect for a date.  They have a very nice patio, which you don't expect if you look at the front of the restaurant.  The staff is attentive and polite.  If you are looking for a unique restaurant, with a great atmosphere, impeccable food, and a good value, look no further.  Tasty Kabob is the place to go!",

Service was all over the place ranging from ultra attentive to absolutely clueless.   Ordering was comical, our waiter had no idea what she was doing, and knew nothing about the menu.  They were out of multiple items including appetizer's and desserts.  The same goes for the food.  The chicken and beef were ok, yet the lamb was literally inedible.  The rice was delicious, but the pita bread was store bought and the grape leaves were from a can.  Prices are definitely on the higher end and not justified.  There are far too many better and less expensive Middle East places on  Apache Blvd as well as the Persian Room in Scottsdale for me to come back here.",

The hummus was good full of nutty, lemony goodness but was overshadowed by the garlicky goodness of the eggplant dip. I called it baba-ghanouj but the owners insisted on eggplant dip. I sat at the bar and the service was prompt and polite except that the conversation was steered political by the owner, a direct violation of bar stool rules and a slight affront to myself ,a former barman. Who isn't talking politics these days? Any way, they did gouge me on a couple rum and cokes for my friend at $8 a pop. The beers were OK. This was strictly an AA meeting- alcohol and appetizers.  Next, we tried the grape leaves, a straight-forward staple at places like this. We finished up with some tabbouleh and the special pickles which were really good dipped in the hummus.  I will say we went on a Friday and it was dead, Pita Jungle was way busier in the same shopping center so the price range might be a little high for students. However the meeting went as planned and I left happy.  Check it out then head over to the hookah bar across the parking lot.",

The owner lady was very professional and gave me warm welcome. However the male server acted like a faceless bouncer somehow as if being forced to work there. I also agree with other reviews. The lentil soup I ordered was lukewarm to say the least. The taste itself was not bad. The Lamb kabob amount was very skimpy but the taste was not bad. The meat was sleeping on a bed of loose long grain rice. All the side was a tiny cherry tomato. It made the plate super boring to say the least. Being a Texan, I can probably say I'm kinda disappointed. However I appreciate their frankness about the sweetness of the desert so I chose to avoid it.  The next table there was 10+ old people bashing about the president loudly. Behave people. This is a restaurant anyways. I don't mind much but I'm sure a lot of people would.",

Tasty Kabob is located in a complex (with a parking lot) with a bunch of other random, casual shops/restaurants.   As for the food, it was good but definitely not my favorite Persian restaurant. The portion size was fairly small. I ordered a lamb & beef combo. The plate was 2/3 rice with 3 small pieces of each meat. The tea I ordered after dinner was the best part.   The service was a fail. There were only two groups in the restaurant--me and my one friend and then a small family who was there for a birthday celebration. Just to get menus and water took a lot of effort on our part. And then to place an order required us to try and get the waiter's attention for about 10-15 minutes. He didn't seem to notice us despite our waving him and then when he finally came over, he said that someone else would come by to take our order. It was like this for the rest of the night.   Overall, nice atmosphere with pretty subpar service (given it wasn't even busy that day). Lastly, the food was okay.",

I am always amazed that Mediterranean Restaurants want to charge for \"Extra Pets.\" I believe they would be better served by including that in the price of the dish. Nonetheless have had several items on the menu and all were four or five stars. Service is impeccable.  Sent friends looking for something unusual here and they loved it as well. My guess is you will not be disappointed, I have never been.",

However the chicken kabob was dry without any discernible seasoning. The lamb kabob was slightly better.   We were never asked how our food was, never got a refill on our drinks, and we had to roust the the waiter from the kitchen to het our bill.   Certainly not worth the $40+ we spent for lunch. Will not be back.",

Left us standing with our mouths open, really. Then she veered off other customers who walked behind us, and offered them patio seating. And.. again told us she had nothing available. I immediately wanted to leave. But my friend has more patience than I so... we asked if we could seat ourselves outside. It was obvious she was stressed, And they needed another waitress. Maybe a replacement even.  Her words lacked tact, much less a friendly tone about anything. Simply rudeness with about 4 encounters before we seated ourselves. The food was fabulous. Suppose my complaint is mostly service. Painful. Nice casual ambiance (patio), good food, good company.  If I do return, trust that it will be takeout only. Such a shame bc the patio has a great vibe.",

Nice casual restaurant. Staff and owner were friendly. We got the Cornish hen, chicken and lamb kebob platter and a chicken shish sandwich. The platters were excellent. The rice seemed fresh and not like it was made two days ago and reheated. The meat was extremely moist and tender. The sandwich however wasn't that great so I would recommend staying with the platters. We also got the yogurt salad which was delicious.  Would definitely go back to this place.",

I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.",

And then I found Tasty Kabob. The tahdig is absolutely legit and I regularly get take out (worth a 15 minute drive from another city, holla).

The grape leaves were stuffed very plump and proved to be just as delicious as they looked.  There were 8 total and I definitely rank them a great \"bang for the buck\" as an appetizer.  The hummus was good, just good.  A little bland and a little thinner than my liking and I wasn't too overwhelmed with the portion size.  My lunch entree was the Gyro Platter, which was literally phenomenal.  The oversized plate seemed almost too small to contain the generous portion sizes provided.  The platter came loaded with a generous portion of fresh, dressed salad greens (more of a spring mix), a huge portion of long grain rice topped with some saffron infused rice.  The gyro meat was a mix of lamb and beef, shaved thinly and folded alongside some seasoned onions and tomatoes.  What impressed me the most is that, for once, the meat was NOT dried out, as I have found in most Middle Eastern restaurants.  All this for less than $25 (two appetizers and an entree).  The seating was good, the music was very good and the service was great (perfect timing and very accommodating).   Overall, this is an easy recommend if your looking for good food & good service at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "If only Tasty Kabob would relocate to the bay area and help fill the Persian food void! This is my type of place:  First and foremost, Tasty Kabob has good, well-executed food. We had shirazi salad, musto khiar, ghormeh sabzi, joojeh, koobideh, zereshk polo and the rose water laced Persian ice cream: The shirazi had a slightly different spice combination that what I'm used to, and came with lime wedges so we could apply the citrus ourselves. I liked this fresh, slightly different version of the salad quite a bit.  The musto khiar was generously portioned, well mixed and delightful (thrilling me to no end, as musto khiar is one of my absolute most favorite foodstuffs).  My Ghormeh Sabzi was delightful-- tangy and flavorful with spices that were mixed in with a deft hand; ghormeh sabzi can, at times, be victim of overwhelming spices, but this version did not suffer.  The kabobs were both well cooked and nicely seasoned, although I felt the koobideh could have used a little more spices. Regardless, both versions were moist and very appealing. The zereshk polo we ordered with the kabobs was also well cooked, and laced with a generous amount of barberries. Finally, the rosewater ice cream, with pieces of pistachio, showcased the fragrant, delicate taste of rosewater exceedingly well. We were stuffed by the time the ice cream hit the table and downed the bowl all the same.  Second, the owners couldn't have been more charming. The party at the table next to us was at TK for an anniversary celebration, and TK's owners went out of their way to help the celebration along. TK's owner later told me that the couple being honored-- as well as their children-- had been coming to the restaurant for years. The owner was clearly very fond of her customers, and they reciprocated the feeling.  Finally, TK is located in a strip mall that includes Planned Parenthood, a vegan-friendly pizza place, gelato, and 24 hour drive-through Mexican. Perhaps you're the type that only likes fine dining. I personally have found that some of the best food around comes in unassuming strip malls with eclectic neighbors.  In all, I'm glad my impulse to seek out Persian food as soon as I leave the bay area guided me to Tasty Kabob. While I'm only in Phoenix once a year I'm sure I'll be back to this tasty eatery as many times as possible.",

    "text": "Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.  An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.  For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.  For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.  For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.  So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.",

The service was friendly and never disappeared for long stretches despite dining on a busy night.  The food tasted good and was in healthy portions, but some of the dishes - especially my Beef Koobideh - was dry and had weak flavor, and the lemonade tasted like powdered, instant, overly sweet muck so watch what drinks you order. I'd say in general it was good, but I've been to better places.",

The food isn't pricey, but it isn't super cheap either.  Depending on what you order, you'll probably spend $30-50 for two people.",

The joojeh kabob (cornish hen) and the bargs (chicken and filet) are always very well marinated, tender, and never dry or tough. Each dish comes with a great helping of hot rice which I also love. The cucmber yogurt dip is a must. Love this place, worth the extra dollar if you want a great Persian treat for yourself.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place for the first time sometime last week. I ordered a plate that said Gryros with a description saying \"beef and lamb\". I had asked the lady who seemed like the owner a few questions about other items on the menu like the filet mignon. She answered me like I was stupid. So I just decided on the Gyro plate that had beef and lamb on it. When my food came I was a little surprised to see that it was not a combination of beef and lamb . The gentlemen serving us were really nice while serving us our drinks and when I brought up the fact that I wanted something with lamb and beef separated. The woman (who seemed like the owner) came or shouting form the back \"what's he problem?\" While others were enjoying their meals nearby. I simply told the woman I thought the dish was something else. She automatically said I was paying for the dish while is disagreed. She got really upset saying that I only asked her about the filet mignon as if that was relevant or as if I was saying she mislead me into getting that dish. I responded I thought the dish had a side of beef and lamb and she responded like I was dumb and said that the dish said gyros and how could I mistaken that. I responded telling her I didn't know and she kept on saying that I never asked her about that dish. She didn't seem to retain anything I was saying. Anyways, I asked her to box the other dish we got and we'll be leaving. She kept on asking if I wanted another dosh and I just told her no and we'd be leaving right away due to the scene she made and and how RUDE this lady was. I seriously could not believe how she though it was proper etiquette to shout and argue with a customer. I don't believe the customer is always right, but the fact that I never yelled at her should be enough not yell at me. I will never ever go here nor recommend this. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.",

I don't know if Tempe knows how good you have it, or maybe you do, but from the tadig and khoresh to the aash, Tasty Kabob is truly authentic Persian food.  If you're looking for good inexpensive thing to try, have the tadig and khoresh with ghormeh sabzi for only $6.50. It can be your meal. Plus the fun of tadig is that you can use it like chips to pick up your savory khoresh.  Why isn't this place in DC???  Aargh! Ah, well at least I found it and enjoyed it. Just like home cooking.",

There's not an item on the menu that isn't worth trying. And when you try something you;ll be sure to want to return soon, for more.  Especially the dessert....If you have a keen palate w/ a sweet tooth, then the homemade Persian ice cream or the homemade cheese cake awaits your inevitable order.   Do yourself a favor and try it. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu either, the staff is very knowledgeable and the owners are very warm, friendly people as well!  P.S.

I went in after they sold the restaurant and after inquiring, found out that the owners were Lebanese but that it was still Persian food on the menu. The food was good but not great and the prices were higher. I went in again (for the last time) a couple of years ago and I was very unhappy with my visit. I ordered the food in Farci, the True names of the dishes but the very young waiter did not understand. He went back and a woman appeared and ask that we order the food as it appears on the menu. I had not even looked at the menu knowing what I wanted right down to the appetizers. I was embarrassed as I looked at the almost unrecognizable menu. I would have left but my adult kids were excited to eat here again. I brought them here all of the time when they were kids and it was more for memories sake that we stayed. The food was still only okay. The prices were ridiculously expensive. I'll stick with The Persian Room if I'm going to pay those kind of prices.",

The yogurt salad (yogurt with cucumbers and mint) is stand-alone delicious, but I prefer to have it on my food.  And for dessert try the Persian ice cream.

Try the special rice (polo) dishes, especially the one with barberries.  My favorite was the lamb kabobs.  If you get a plate with rice and salad (you can get all rice but it would be a lot of rice) ask for the salad on a separate plate.  It is a very good salad with excellent quality greens and an Italian type of dressing. The Persian ice cream was great.  Baklava is different from other versions but really good.  The eggplant appetizer was also very good. This is clearly a family run place and this is a very welcoming and gracious family.  Service was wonderful.  We had a great experience.",

The woman who greated me and took my order was very friendly and not at all concerned that I came in close to closing hours.  I ordered the beef kabob dinner plate with half salad and half rice. I also treated myself to an order of the Persian ice cream. When they prepared my order, the cook seperated my ice cream from the dinner plate (since the dinner plate was hot) and even put it on ice for me in a ziplock bag. They definitely went above my wildest expectations with their level of service.  When I got home the dinner plate was still steaming hot and obviously prepared fresh. I'm a huge steak fan and don't generally enjoy sirloin, but the preperation of the meat was perfect. It was tender, juicy, and extremely flavorful. The spices were great without overpowering the flavor of the cut of meat. It also had just the right amount of charbroiled flavor like it was cooked over a coal fire. Yum!  The rice was possibly the best long grain rice I've ever had. So good.  The salad wad tasty too.  Also? The Persian ice cream? It was like ambrosia. I'm not even exaggerating.   The dinner portion was huge, which left me plenty for dinner tonight, though I must admit that it was difficult not to devour the whole plate on first taste. It was a struggle not to over eat, considering how amazingly yummy it was.  Yeah. I'll be back again, this time with friends!",

    "text": "The food here is really good here. The staff is friendly and the place has a nice ambiance. The Chicken Sish Kabob is recommended. You can have your food with saffron rice or salad or half and half (both). The salad is absolutely delicious!  A little warning about the Persian ice cream though. It is vanilla with pistachio bits, saffron and rose wash so it will taste like you're eating perfume. If you are not into unusual tasting food, then don't order this.   If you have an adventurous side and want to try this, I can say that after 3-4 bites of this ice cream, the perfume taste gradually becomes less noticeable.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Authentic Persian cuisine at very reasonable prices. After you have their saffron scented basmati rice, you'll realize how lousy the rice is at most middle Eastern restaurants. I love the tadig with a choice of three stews. My ex boyfriend's grandmother translated tadig as \"rice in the shape of a pot\". Basmati rice is partially cooked, taken out of the pot, then the pot is oiled and cooked at low heat so that the bottom layer of rice gets chewy, crisp and delicious. Pair this with a fragrant pomegranate walnut stew with chicken, or a beef stew with greens cooked with dried limes for just the right amount of tart. Finish it off with their rose water ice cream and tea with hard sugar cubes. Yum.",

Everything was perfect. Great service, meal came out within 10-15 minutes and I asked for the salad to not touch the rice or meat and they put it in a little bowl for me. Prices are very reasonable and the vegetables I ordered on the side were fantastic. The only recommendation is to make the salad taste more like greek salad. It was just plain. Other than that, nothing but compliments. I will definitely be back as soon as I can.",

    "text": "Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fiance ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow.   And whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it.",

I am so picky with kabob places and this is definitely one of the better ones I've ate at! You can just taste the quality of their spices. The meat was tender and juicy and the veggies not too burnt or undercooked. The only other server there besides the owner was so attentive that the minute I finished eating he bussed my table. I just had the most perfect experience here and will be returning often to give them business! The owner is a great guy too and very hospitable!",

    "text": "HORRIBLE TREATMENT OF MYSELF AND MY 70-YEAR-OLD MOTHER! DO NOT VISIT THIS BUSINESS!  As a businessman, I hate writing bad reviews for businesses and this is the second one I have ever written in my whole life!   But I tell you with no hesitation that I would have given them not even one star if I could and I'll tell you why!  A friend recommended this place for having good food so I wanted to take my 70 year old mother there. I called on a Sunday at 1:00 P.M. An older man answered and said they were having a private party and if we went we had to sit in the balcony. I asked if it would be hot and he said that it was shaded. I asked whether I had to have a reservation. He asked when I wanted to go and I said 4:30 P.M. He said it is OK and that the later you come the better. His exact sentence was: \"I don't want to promise something I can keep.\" Thinking this man was so honorable and nice, I drove from North Scottsdale to Tempe, about 25 Miles one way. When we got there about 5:30 to have complied with his statement: \"The later the better\", an extremely arrogant woman who was in charge and seemed as if she was part owner assured me that they couldn't help us and we had to leave! I told her I specifically talked to someone but she kept saying: \"Who did you talk too? No one had promised anything to you.\" I told her I was not crazy but she kept saying sorry, no one promised anything to you. Suddenly, the man with whom I had spoken appeared. I asked him about it and after saying hello and asking me how I was doing, I asked him what the heck was up and he just stared at me!!!   Now, I am not expecting anything except some measure of humility and kindness to be apologetic about a mistake they made and to make me drive over 50 miles for nothing, but no! The arrogance was unbelievable!!!   I understand that mistakes happen and all I wanted was some sincere apology which of course did not happen. Anyone else would have at least tried to make things better for their own ratings sake. Maybe just be nice and offer me a glass of water for all that driving but no!  Fair warning to smart readers of Yelp. I am a busy man. If I sit and take 10 minutes of my time to write this, you know how angry I am at their behavior today.   DO NOT FREQUENT THIER ESTABLISHMENT!!   MAYBE THEY LEARN SOMETHING!",

Service was not as warm and friendly and the food was not the same. We stopped eating here and chose to drive quite a bit farther because we really like Persian food. A while back my wife insisted we try it again to avoid the long drive. The service was just barely OK at best. They had a very young wait staff that lacked training on how to treat guests. The food lacked flavor and the chicken was dry. Halfway through the meal my wife agreed with me that it had not gotten any better and we would continue to drive to The Persian Room or Pars in Scottsdale as we know the food and service is always consistently good and the entrees are almost the same price as Tasty Kabob. It's too bad this place changed things. When we first started coming here there was always a wait for a table because it really was great food.",
