    "text": "Ate from this restaurant 2 mornings in a row.. first time we sat in the restaurant. It was really warm (too warm) in there and got a real rushed type feeling. Hubby got corned beef which was small in general. I got pancakes.. both were ok. Just ok.  Second morning I called and tried to order take out but the woman said that you have to come in personally and order it from the bar.. I've NEVER heard or seen any restaurant do that. Get a credit card over the phone or whatever to ensure order. The whole point is to run in and pick up your food. If I wanted to wait I'd eat there?! Unfortunately when we got there it was a 30min wait and we had a flight to catch so we ordered to go.  We both got omelettes, which I have to admit, they were the fluffiest I've ever had. Flavor could've been better with better quality fillings. The tomatoes in mine were really under ripe. I wanted to try the Dutch baby but was short on time since I needed to stand there while the food was being cooked. If I could've ordered in advance I totally would've tried it! The servers, hostess and cashier were all kind of a hot mess. No smiles anywhere. It did seem really busy I admit but still.. pull it together people.. it's a breakfast place. Start the morning with a smile!",

    "text": "I agree with many of the other reviews.  The NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is a bit ridiculous in this day.  It was WAY overpriced.  The menu selections were really limited, I mean it IS a Pancake House, but there was nothing spectacular about it.  I had the spinach and mushroom crepe.  The crepe part was OK, but the filling tasted like previously frozen cooked-spinach mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  They  gave me a little extra bowl of ICE COLD mushroom soup (which they called sauce) on the plate along side of 3 crepes.  Bland, Bland, Bland...... The waitress was OK, but the hostess was pretty \"in your face\" about the CASH only policy and rudely pointed me to the ATM behind me.   I was able to pull together the cash, without using the ATM, so really no big deal. Would I visit again? No.  Sad, because I thought it would be fun for my kids.",

    "text": "You probably don't want to dine here unless you're a regular and at least 65 years or older. We stopped by a little before noon (they close at 1pm) the hostess didn't even direct us to our table, she simply pointed in a general direction and said \"the second to last table.\" The waitress came by to take our order and I asked if it was possible to pay an up charge to substitute regular pancakes for specialty ones. She already seemed irritated but apparently my question put her over the edge. She didn't even fully explain herself so I just said ok can I order a junior apple pancake, she raised her voice and spoke in a very demeaning manner and said that I couldn't. I told her I wasn't trying to make a substitution, I just wanted to order a junior pancake for my daughter. She just walked away without saying a word, leaving us dumbfounded. I heard her yelling over the kitchen counter, she came back and said that they were all out of junior pancakes because they were about to close. Alrighty then. Our food was brought to the table moments later (along with our bill) and that was the last we saw of our waitress. No checking in to see if we needed anything (which we did) and no refills on our drinks. Shortly after, two parties were sat near us. One of them were apparently regulars and the waitress' mood completely shifted, she was super friendly and attentive. On the other hand, a table with two gentlemen were sat right next to us and she was incredibly rude! They asked for coffee and she walked away from them before they could even finish their sentence. As she walked away she loudly exclaimed to herself that she didn't understand why the hell people were coming in so late and that she had been up since 4am. Maybe you should stop being a waitress after you hit a certain age where you feel that it's ok to be rude to people and make them feel like they're inconveniencing you at your job.",

I should have left then. At a table close to me was a family playing with an ipad making all kinds of noise (which i am ok with) and she said that wasn't a cell phone. I said so my conversation is louder than anyone else talking to each other in here? I had been almost whispering. She said its policy and turned her head. Breakfast was OK. Omelet is really big and fluffy..little too many eggs for me but OK. Home fries were average. Pancakes were awesome! When leaving i told the cashier how it ruined my breakfast and she got mean and said its policy and turned her head. I asked her about the family  on the ipad and she also said not a cell phone. I told her i was here for 8 days and would have come here every day but i would NEVER come there again. I also let everyone waiting in line ( Saturday ) to know to turn off their cell phones.... its policy!",

The IRS must love you because you don't pay taxes on what you actually make. (Cash only means you only report what you want to, not what you actually rake in. How clever)  The bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great. The negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table. This place is over priced, doesn't take plastic, and the wait staff need a huge improvement.   I'll take IHOP any day of the week over this silly place. You do remember you're in Scottsdale, right?",

    "text": "The wife and I visited this establishment this past Sunday to compare it to the one we used to go to in Forest Park Illinois. I had read here on yelp about the long lines and indeed we ran into that when we arrived about noon on Sunday. There was a 20 minute wait and i was shocked to see this place so busy do to the fact that it is right next to a Motel 6. I say that because with the obvious patrons from the Motel i would think people would not come because they would have to \"battle\" with the Motel crowd.  When we were seated we got a very nice waitress, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered. I had the smoked turkey sausage with 2 eggs, 3 buttermilk pancakes, and hasbrowns. My wife had Pancakes with 2 eggs with chorizo sausage and hashbrowns. The FOOD is definitely the reason for the long lines people...trust me we were not disappointed at all with that. The service was outstanding as well and while it is a little more expensive than in Illinois the FOOD more than made up for it.  A personal note here: i was a huge fan of The skillets this establishment  made back in Illinois which consisted of potatoes,  3 eggs, your choice of 4 kinds of meat , cheese  and,  veggies. This was definitely the best deal in the house for the money, but this pancake house did not have it on their menu. You can order all of these things however,  a la carte but it will cost you, but trust me all mixed together it is quite delicious.  Now i don't know if i will go again on a weekend day, due to the lines but i will have to visit during the week to see how it looks then. Also bring CASH because unlike the location in Illinois they don't take plastic here. So i will keep you posted my friends as i plan to visit them this coming Monday, until then Eat, Drink and  Be Merry!!!!!",

Staff were friendly and food was delicious. We had an opposite experience here in Scottsdale. First, when we walked in, the hostess looked straight at me, acknowledging me but not smiling, then turned away and kept doing whatever she was doing. About a minute later she finally came over to seat my mom and I. She brought us to our booth and literally threw the menus onto the table and just walked away. The waitress was a little friendlier, but not much. Not only was the service horrible, but the food was not good either. Hash browns tasted frozen. The only thing saving this place is that they do have good pancakes, but I really don't think it's worth it at this location. I could hear two other tables around us also complaining about the service, don't really see a reason to come back.",

They have changed their policy and are now accepting credit cards which is a plus. The downside is they increased their prices significantly. I ordered 2 eggs (scrambled), 3 sausage links which came with 3 pancakes. It was almost 9 dollars. I had a side of hash browns and coffee. The bill was just over $13.50. The price is way too expensive for what I got. The food is good but it's much like the decor, plain. There are many good breakfast places in Scottsdale which offer a much more for that kind of money. This place used to be my go to place for breakfast but not anymore. If the prices were more in line with what you get I would continue to eat here. I would also change their rating to 5 stars.",

Secondly, our server barely spoke English and we had difficulty understand her and she us.  This is in Scottsdale mind you, right next door to the high end mall.  Thirdly, the decor is early 1980's with cheesy yellow tables and putty/white combo wooden chairs.   You're either going to be transported to Boogie Nights or think the place is skanky, as my Aunt thinks.  Be warned that the menu you see on the internet is NOT indicative of the actual menu.  I came here specifically for the sourdough pancakes advertised on the web and they were nowhere to be found.  I had the 49'er pancakes instead.  They were OK.  I believe they are the same as the wrappers they use for their crepes however, just be aware... under a different, gimmicky/cutesy name.  If you're a big pancake fan like I am you should know that they do indeed have real maple, but you'll need to pay for it.  About $2-3 extra and it comes in a little bottle.  Otherwise, you'll get the normal high-fructose corn syrup, caramel colored goop chains like this call maple syrup.  Would I come back?  Probably not.  It was kitschy fun the first time but since I'm a real pancake afficionado and there's 2 breakfast joints in town that have been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that make their own pancakes from scratch and have real maple sitting on the table, I'll probably leave the pancakes at the OPH to those staying at the Motel 6 next door -- where most of their clientele seems to come from.  p.s.  CASH ONLY, unless you're an AZ resident with your checkbook handy",

The food was outstanding (as it is at most OPHs).  The crepe my one son ordered was HUGE - he was very glad he didn't order the three.  My other son had biscuits and gravy and said it was very good.  I had regular old bacon and eggs - and it was outstanding. The bacon was perfectly cooked - not too crispy, not too chewy.  The portions were generous but not overwhelming.  The service was a wee bit slow, but the restaurant was very busy that morning. Note that they only seat complete parties, so don't bother sending someone ahead to get a table.",

I ordered buttermilk pancakes but I ended up sharing the blueberry pancakes with my companion. I couldn't stop eating them! Light, fluffy, and flavorful. You can request a blueberry compost with them as well but I tell you, they can surely stand alone. If I return to this restaurant, I'll try a different flavor. I also, ordered egg whites, chicken sausage and hashbrowns. The waitress would not allow me to substitute the hashbrowns for breakfast potatoes. She was firm on that! The egg whites cost $1.50 to substitute in place of eggs and the $4.50 OJ was not worth that steep price tag. The chicken sausage was over cooked so I was disappointed there too. Our bill was $40.60! For a basic breakfast. Parking is limited in the lot but there is street parking nearby. The service was fine but in a small, quaint little breakfast place, I would have expected more personable service. I'm realizing that people don't value customer service like they used to. If you decide to try them out, order the blueberry pancakes. You won't be disappointed.",

The place reminds me of the joints that my parents would take me to for breakfast when we were on vacation somewhere.  I'd order breakfast, it wouldn't be all that good, and I'd have a slightly upset stomach for the next hour while we were driving to our next destination.  The food here is mediocre at best.  I always order my eggs over hard when I'm eating out.  The ones here came with a brown crust and were obviously overcooked.  I tried my wife's and they were soaked in butter--not good--I could feel the old upset stomach coming on again. . .  The potatoes here are a horror that need  to be experienced in order to believe them.  One bite yields up a mouth bitter with onion, garlic, and grease--no potato to discern.  Pancakes, being that they are part of the name of this place, are the specialty of the House.  My wife ordered the Dutch Baby.  She thought it was decent.  It wasn't my taste--reminded me of solidified custard.  The regular pancakes overall were good, but I could have made something like them myself with a pan and a box of Bisquick.  There just wasn't anything here that I could say was distinctive about this place at all--no real reason to put it on my breakfast rotation.  It's got blah food and nice service.  No, I'll pass on this one.",

Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner. C.)

Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?! D.) All of the above.  Ding! Time's up. Pencils down.   Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.  I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.  A strict \"No Cellphones\" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.  That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.  And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.  Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!  Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?  It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.",

The omelets are half the size, the rules restrict any creative freedom you like to take with your food, and the service was cold and lacking. It was still a good breakfast, but the one in Michigan is the type of breakfast you dream about.",

    "text": "So soon since swerving sinisterly southwestardly to seek stimulus in this sullen economic situation, I found the syrupy soaked security of a seemingly \"regulars\" secret scene to engage in mutual swelling!   My eyes were bigger than my stomach as each word on the menu left me wondering if they could truly deliver something more than the average diner when it comes to omelettes and pancakes.  Then I began to see what would become my breakfast dining goal for the next few years...\" an apple pancake\" more beautiful than any other.  But I did not allow that evil ice cream laden morsel to sway me.  Yes, I owe it to all my Yelp fans to remain objective and focused and what?!!  Did I just eat that Dutch Pancake \"soufle\"?  Did I really get lemons and confection sugar like the old country?  Was it the biggest rumour ever that I finished that ( and a side of canadian bacon) all by myself in less than 20 minutes?    Disclaimer:  I might have passed this place up on the road but, thank goodness my friend Henri knew where to stop and was able to look beyond the Motel 6 that is attached to the premises.  This attempt to remain incognito did not stop the line from peeling out of the door.  Nor did the fact that there is no way to pay with a credit card or debit card!  Thank goodness there is an ATM in there.    But if you decide to look past that, and focus on the awesome family like hospitality of the staff and the scrumptousness of the wafflisciousness of  whatever dish you decide to savour, you will become a hush hush admirerer who is not trying to make it harder to get in for food on Sunday!",

Their western omelet was very good, they bake it so the egg rises.  It was very fluffy with just the right amount of ham and cheese, and was not greasy at all.  Plus you get pancakes with it, although I opted for an english muffin.  I would put the food here on par with US Egg, but with a better atmosphere.",

This is the best breakfast place you will ever eat at. The food is amazing and very consistent. I get the 49er flap jack everytime. The apple pancake and \"dutch baby\" are RIDICULOUSLY huge and delicous. We ordered a half one and split it amongst the table as a \"breakfast desert\"....it was amazing.

Every time I have been here I have enjoyed the food.   I have become fond of the Banana Pancakes. They are served with chunks of bananas in the batter. I believe they come with coconut flakes on top, but I hold those since I am not a fan. They are oh so good. There regular breakfast is good too. I am usually pretty bland when it comes to breakfast. Just give me some bacon, eggs, and hash browns and I'm good. Most selections come with pancakes and for a small fee you can substitute speciality pancakes. The waffles are good too, they are big just like everything else here.   It would have been 5 stars if not for the whole, \"we don't accept plastic\" deal. Just plan ahead or use the ATM machine they now have. I should have gotten in that business and sold them one. Damn it!",

    "text": "Ok, Yes there are lot's of rules, but some of the rules are totally fine in my book.. The no cell phone policy is spot on.. The cash thing sucks.. The wait time is completely out of their hands.. The service is always prompt, and yes if you order anything that is not on your plate(ie:blueberry syrup or peanut butter) you will be charged extra for it. But there is one reason to put up with all of their rules.. And that is in the formation of the 49er flapjacks.. I have mine with syrup and Peanut Butter, and it is the single best breakfast item I have ever put in my mouth, I go to OPH during the week, I never wait, and I bring cash, and life is good... IMO stick to the pancakes.. This isn't Original Omelet House..",

    "text": "Wow. Avoid this place like the plague.   We were very excited to eat here, so despite us having plans afterwards, we figured we would just show up late. They said 15 - 20 mins wait for a table, not a big deal. 20 mins later we get the worst table in the whole restaurant, not a big deal. We order right away considering we didn't have much time to waste.   20 mins after ordering we noticed a few tables that showed up after us had already recieved their food. 20 mins later we noticed those tables already left and the people who got there after them had already ordered and received their food.   10 mins later I noticed a lady who had showed up about 10 mins ago had already recieved her food which was the same order as ours. At this point we recieved part of one of our orders... The rest of the food is no where in sight.  An hour after we order, we decided that we have to leave because of prior obligations. We complain to the cashier who then starts to rudely tell us food takes time to cook, but then or waitress who sees us leaving comes over and tells the cashier how we had been waiting for an hour for our food and it still hasn't come.   Thank you incompetent cooks, rude cashier, and worthless manager for ruining my day. Our server was alright... She was probably the best part of that catastrophy of a restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this restaurant for the past 24 years. I am originally from Chicago,where there are many original pancake houses.The past 24 years I have never had a complaint until today. I went there with my daughter and nephew, My daughter ordered spinach crepes, They were not to her liking. We immediately called the waitress to let her know. she took them away. the check comes and the item is still on the bill. I asked her about it she said they won't take it off because it wasn't something that they've done. I asked for the manager/owner, here is the part that got me. my daughter said she didn't like it. he said that this is a first that he has been making it for 30years. I say all taste buds are different. He starts to pretty much argue with me. he says maybe she is allergic to spinach( she ordered a spinach crepe by the way) he starts to tell me basically to shut up,that I wasn't the one who ordered it. really rude and unprofessional. My daughter isn't as outspoken as me, I wasn't paying for something substandard in our eyes; especially since she only took one bite. First of all it wasn't a real crepe, too thick. This is from the very daughter who ordered it. By the way she is a Classically trained CHEF!!!!! It breaks my heart to be treated this way in a restaurant that I have loved for so many years . I will never return nor will I ever recommend. I have sent many people there. I love it so much that I travel from Buckeye AZ. to Scottsdale AZ just to eat there. Never again, will not spend my money for disrespect!!! Such a disappointment, Not to mention the mushroom sherry sauce for my mushroom omelet was different and tasted off, even the color of it was different. food was substandard!!!! When this person started talking to me that way I happened to be still eating. I was so upset I got up and walked out!! I left my family to pay the bill,",

It was so good that I wanted more, but I was SO full! Husband had biscuits and gravy, hash browns and sausage. The gravy was delicious and the hash browns tasted amazing!  It's a haul from our house, but well worth the drive. Can't wait to come back and try the Dutch baby! We saw several come out of the kitchen and it looks fantastic!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I love The Original Pancake House and have been going since I was a kid. I moved to Arizona from Wisconsin almost two years ago and was ecstatic when I found out they had a location here. I live near South Mountain so I usually make a special trip to drive 25 minutes to get breakfast here. I looked at it's location on the map and saw it was in Scottsdale near Fashion Square so I had high expectations. This is where it gets funny...  The first time I drove there, I went past it atleast two or three times until I found it. There it was...in a dumpy parking lot attached to a Motel 6!! Yes, you read that right. I love the food so I gave it a shot. When I walked in, I immediately noticed how tiny it was, the old people/egg yolk smell, and the tacky signs everywhere that said to turn off your cell phones. If people can't sit on their phones, then people shouldn't be able to read the newspaper. Scottsdale has a lot of business oriented people that need their phones and it's extremely tacky to have that posted with neon papers everywhere.   I order my usual Dutch Baby with a side of whip cream, bacon and hash browns. The Dutch Baby takes 20 minutes to make but it is totally worth it. The whip cream makes the Dutch Baby even better and it's my favorite whip cream I've had since I've lived hear. I realize that sounds funny, but most breakfast places use the can stuff or even worse, the frosting stuff. Hash browns were definitely fresh but tasted like nothing. Bacon was perfectly crispy with no soggy spots just like I like it. I noticed a little hair on it which I thought was my dogs so I continued to eat it. I kept eating the bacon until I noticed that there was a lot of little fuzzies and realized that they actually patted down the bacon with crappy paper towels. Thanks for getting rid of the grease but how gross!  In other reviews, I see people talk about the rude waitstaff. I've had pretty good luck but I know who they're referring to. The first time I ate there we were sat 45 minutes before close and when it was maybe 5 minutes after close while other tables were still there, this old lady who worked their kept walking by saying they were closed conveniently \"talking to herself\" which made our group very uncomfortable. I tried to order grapefruit juice which they had at their other location but they didn't offer that. No sparkling water, so I stuck with my water and lemon. My guest orders soda every time and they bring it out IN A CAN... So my third time, I brought my own sparkling water in a can and we got sat at a table. Turns out we got the rude lady this time. She didn't greet us at all and walked right up to our table, picked up my can and said I can't bring that in there and it's \"illegal\" in a really rude tone again making my table feel uncomfortable. I understand not bringing other food in, but if it's a unopened canned drink when they serve only canned drinks?!?!   After my experience with the rude waitress that makes me uncomfortable even when I'm not at her table, and the horrible smell and location, I called to order take out. To my surprise, they don't do orders over the phone and you have to come in and order at the bar. The Dutch Baby states on the menu it takes atleast 20 minutes and the Apple Pancake takes 40. So I should show up and wait forever for take out? What's the point of even offering that service?  Depending on the business of the location, the hostess can be rude but the last time I was there it was very pleasant. I ended up buying a shirt from there just because I liked the shirt. The bussers are very quick and extremely attentive. Request Betty the waitress if she's there because she's easily the best waitress there! Find more people like her!!! Please consider refacing/remodeling or changing the location. I know you're relatively busy, but you could be busier and/or have more tables. If I happen to find another place in the valley that makes good Dutch Baby's, it's safe to say I will not come back. 5 stars on food -1 for the fuzzy bacon I get every time, -1 for scary old waitress, and -1 for horrifying crackhead location.",

Camelback is no exception when it comes to quality.  If I had to change one thing, it would be within the parking lot. When you make the left turn off of E. Camelback (coming from Phoenix), you can almost miss this place due to its close proximity to the Motel 6. In fact, I'm certain that Motel 6 sold the OPH property it once owned. The table that I sat at faced the Motel 6's pool. Not a bad thing, yet this property can be easily missed from the road.   If I were OPH, I would place signage that clearly distinguishes this from the Motel 6. Altogether, a pretty good place to stop by to get some good eating!",

    "text": "Finally made it to the Original Pancake House, never been, but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes. I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me  1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa  2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place  3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game   4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.  5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young haha  Also, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it?   After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me.   Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, I'm not sure I'll be back.",

I was so happy to find one in Arizona. My favorite thing is the Dutch Baby and it was amazing as always! On the way to the restaurant my father was so excited that he would get his fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and cheese blintzes, only to find out that they didn't have either. This is his breakfast of choice when we visit the Florida locations. I've never actually seen my father as crushed in spirit as he was. They also didn't have club soda or sparkling water which I thought was also super weird. He wound up with an omelette which he enjoyed. We learned from our waitress Jessica that each franchise has a different menu and that the blintzes have been requested by other customers as well. She even said she would speak to the owner to see if it could be added due to the amount of requests! Jessica was a great waitress and even sympathized with my father. Hopefully when we come to visit next time they will update the options!",

We were immediately seated by a friendly waitress who gave us the low-down on the menu. I ordered the the buckwheat pancakes with Canadian bacon and scrambled eggs with an iced coffee. My husband ordered the Hawaiian pancakes. My coffee was served to me from a pot, most likely brewed at 6 AM, therefore tasted stale, and then poured over ice in a glass cup, served without a straw, which is absolutely the worst kind of way to drink it. My pancakes were tasty, but the eggs were lukewarm and tasteless and the Canadian bacon was as cold and dry as a honey baked ham left out all night and served the day after Thanksgiving. My husband enjoyed the first few bites of his pancakes, but couldn't finish them due to their extreme richness, and then later came down with a serious case of Montezuma's Revenge later that night. I'm not saying it was related, but it was related. We both agreed we will never be back.",

But for a place called \"Original Pancake House\", the pancakes simply aren't that good.  Imagine my surprise :/    Now, I am not saying the food is bad... I am just saying... not that great.  And the flagship item, pancakes, were the main culprit.  Maybe it was an off day, but my pancakes were not the light, fluffy, buttery goodness, that I would've expected.  Instead, they smelled and tasted of straight up yeast.  I've never had that experience before.  Yeast in my bread?  Yaaaas! Yeasty pancakes?  Not so much.  Plus there was a curious lack of selection in the syrup/honey department.  I mean, it's a pancake house--shouldn't' there be some pouring options?!  Maybe i'll give them another try someday, but for today I remain disappointed.",

There is always a long wait and they have a tiny waiting area so you end up waiting outside in the heat. 2. They only take cash. I'm a debit card kinda girl. 3. The staff is not very friendly and they do not accommodate special orders - they may have blueberry pancakes and banana pancakes on the menu but if you want blueberry-banana pancakes you're outta luck. 4. It never seems very clean. 5. It's overpriced.  So why do I keep going back? 1. The food. They have really good pancakes.  Damn it.",

It might be a bit more like service on the East Coast, efficient and no nonsense, but for how busy they always are that's expected. The food is amazing. Always.   I love the French Crepes. Perfect Crepes with fresh sliced strawberries inside and on top, yummy strawberry syrup and fresh whipping cream!!! With a side of crispy bacon. Amazing meal.  My husband loves the breakfast burrito. It's HUGE. Filled with tons of  goodies- egg, ect and has a green tomatillo sauce on top and melted cheese. It's his favorite breakfast.   Enjoy!!",

We visited this location this past Monday, and sat at the bar since there wasn't a wait for that area. The decor, waitress and food were meh at best.  What we saw take place behind the bar has made us non-repeat customers of this location. A younger waitress with light brown hair in a ponytail used bar cloths to wipe up spills of beverages on the floor two different times, and then put the cloths on the counter to use again a short while later...which was to wipe the inside of a refrigerated wall unit holding milk and juice. About 15 minutes after that, she was pouring tea into a glass and put her thumb inside to wipe off something, and then proceeded to fill the glass and take it to a customer.  Needless to say, absolutely disgusting and likely health violations as well. We will never return nor recommend to others.",

For whatever reason, this Oregon based franchise does not seem to apply its standards rules to the Scottsdale location which may be best described as stuck in the 60's with its horrible attitude toward customers, refusal to take any kind of plastic card, and even its refusal to serve Splenda (which costs more than other sugar substitutes).  Saving pennies at every corner may seem like a good idea for a business, but when it ends up disrespecting your customer base, not such a good idea.

I don't, as a rule, wait but I really wanted those flapjacks!  We were taken to our table by a hostess who almost didn't seat us because my brother was in the restroom.  I had to tell her where he was...kinda ridiculous.    We were famished and ordered coffee, pancakes, corned beef hash, eggs, and a few other goodies.  Our water and coffee were never less than half-full, our waitress was reall nice, and we walked out with leftovers.  So I struggle with rating this place.  The service was good once we were seated.  The flapjacks are really good.  The coffee was too.  They take credit cards now, which is a plus.   The hash was dry and grainy and we took it home JUST because it was 5.95.  The eggs and hash browns weren't wonderful either .  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience but I have an aversion to traveling, waiting, and explaining where one of our party is just to have food that is average.

Furthermore this establishment as been there for 25-30 years under one manager and this model works!!!!!! Talk about great customer service!  I requested the cheese grits with turkey bacon instead of pork bacon and was denied...not because they didn't have turkey bacon but because they don't do substitutions. I instead order a side of chicken sausages, which had the texture of salmon patties.   Of all the places to eat breakfast I am disappointed with this selection.

Wasn't ready for that. Luckily, they have an ATM onsite.  Secondly, they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting.  Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.

There is a manager there,  an older lady, she works as a hostess as well  when she is not aimlessly walking the restaurant, ignoring customers who are waiting to be seated,  never mind there are empty tables everywhere.  Last Sunday. April 28th, we stopped there to celebrate a birthday,  it was around 10 am. As always,  the parking is bad. I was surprised to find as many empty tables as there were. We were seated in the side room of the restaurant,  and it was absolutely freezing in there! Not cold, but freezing! Here comes the hostess, acting all important. She is again aimless wandering around.  We requested that the ceiling fan be turned down, as I stated, it was very cold. She gives me additude about it, stating she was hot that was the reason the fans were on so high. Maybe,  but at these prices, I am not paying for cold food because she is in menopause! The hostess did turn off the fan, as soon as the food arrived,  the fan was instantly turned back on.  It cost me 35.00 dollars for cold food! Cold baby Dutch pancake,  cold waffles,  and bacon to me looked like it was taken out of the pack, and put on the plate.  I personally want to thank this old lady hostess, for ruining  our meal, and for her lovely additude!  I could have gotten warmer food from McDonald's,  and not have the additude from some who has serious delusions about herself and her mediocre job.",

    "text": "This place is located within the property of the Motel 6 Camelback. the only complaint I've ever heard is about the prices but let me tell you these people know how they cook a breakfast. I'm a biscuits and gravy with eggs kind of guy, I don't really do a lot of pancake eating but this place makes it worth it. I recommend the short stack and like I said biscuits and gravy with the scrambled eggs and I mean cup of joe they make. Thank God they cared enough not to stuff another Denny's on the side of the motel that's what makes this place more of a hotel way to go Pancake House.before I sign off don't let me forget the girl Kristen in the front of the restaurant is the absolute best she knows how to take care of handicapped, regular people, and can even be sweet to  hard to deal with customers, her smile makes everyone happy and give them nothing to complain about.",

We order coffee and cream but she forgot about the cream, I had to ask again, then we ordered, she didn't get right. By the time our breakfast arrived, our cups were empty but she never offered us more coffee! We talked to the manager but he didn't care! He told me it was his fault because he doesn't like to waste coffee so we have to ask for it! Can you believe it? I'll never go back to that place again. Don't waste your money. There's better restaurants around where you can be treated like you deserve.",

    "text": "Me and my wife where running late on a wed getting to the place at 1pm. We where the last people seated before they lock the doors to incoming customers for the day. I personally haven't had a German pancake AKA a Dutch Baby since I was a boy. Over 20 years ago . Needlees to say that's all I really came for. So 15 min later after ordering the freaking awesomely delicious strawberry lemonade and my wife hemming and hawing over the menu she ordered a 2.50 can of Pepsi. (Yes per can) they have no soda fountain. My wife ordered tandy I attempted to order a Dutch baby but was told no. That it was to late. The waitress put in the wife's order n honestly I was done. We decided if the only reason I came there was for something I could not have we might as well go to a lunch place and get something else besides a breakfast at 1:30pm.  Well as fate would have it as me n the wife got up it seemed as if all the staff took notice . The very caring hostess at the register asked why we where leaving without eating. I politely told her that I'd been up since 5am craving a German pancake from my childhood but for various reasons I was withheld all morning and decided to just get lunch. She instantly looked at the clock quizzically and got the attention of a man named Ron and explained that we had been here for 15 minutes and no one said anything about not having a Dutch baby available. She asked him politely if he'd be willing to make me one. Ron didnt hesitate for a second. Saying \"yeah of course just let me finish here\" hesaid a few words to the women he was talking to and went off to the kitchen. Well @ that point there was no way I I could leave. Not only for the fact I was getting what I wanted but just for the fact that I haven't been treated that well in any establishment in years. I mean honestly I didnt complain at all . I  felt let down n frustrated but they weren't the reason I arrived so late. I didnt ask to speak to a manager or anything and these people just instinctively had the best service. I have complained at other places for real issues. I have no problem doing so when there's a real problem. More often than not most places still handle issue poorly if at all. I just want to say thank you to Ron the GM n cook apparently. Also the hostess who's name I sadly did not get. You guys made me and my wife feel valued. Thank you so very much.  That makes the cost of a $2.50 12oz can of Pepsi almost tolerable. LoL",

This seems to be a simple problem to overcome if the cook would taste his food. No time to return them due to busy day that day. The rest of the food was good, not great. Short stack of Hawaiian pancakes - loaded with pineapple, topped with coconut and came with it's own sweet syrup. These were good, a new twist. The bacon omelette was fine, nothing superb and the coffee situation was great. My coffee cup was always full. This place falls just outside my Big 4 Scottsdale breakfast eateries.",

It's a good morning kind of place!  It's stuck in time and they make it work. When I first starting going here they didn't take credit cards or debit cards, cash only.  I thought that was a little strange but they have since changed that policy.   The dutch baby... OMG.  I love this delicious buttery, sweet pancake bowl that takes some time but worth the wait, it's superb!!  A couple dabs of butter, powder sugar, lemon and maple syrup and you will have breakfast dessert party in your mouth!!  I also love it with orange  Suzette sauce!  Which brings me to their crepes... french crepes!!  Have to try them... they are hard to pass up!  Dessert for breakfast.    The savory side of me has had their Eggs Michael which reminded me of biscuits and gravy but a much more sophisticated version.  Mushrooms in a sherry sauce over eggs served on an english muffin. Need I say more.  The also serve up some mean potato pancakes... it's a heavy breakfast, so good.  Servers are usually fast and so is the food.  The dutch baby is the only dish that takes additional time.  Deciding on what to order,  savory vs. sweet is always my biggest issue.  Both are great here!!",

    "text": "Admittedly, I've been to several OPH's around the country, and while each franchise seems to have a lot of leeway in altering their menu or decorating as they see fit, across the board I think this is the type of restaurant you can't truly appreciate until you've become a regular at one of them.  Many are family owned and have become neighborhood institutions.  This particular branch derives a certain amount of \"charm\" from its attachment to a Motel 8, walls that have been collecting grime and signatures from celebrities for years, and newer solid surfacing table and countertops that are rainbow flecked, perhaps to coordinate with the teal paint details?  The angry \"turn your cell phones off\" signs have an air of authority that demand that the customers respect the wait staff.  The menu here mirrors most in the franchise (enormous apple pancake, oven baked dutch baby, a variety of breakfast crepes, traditional - ie, non-Belgian - waffle, fat oven baked omelets and a wide variety of pancakes), and additionally offers a few egg scramblers and daily specials.  I'll point out that I LOVE 49ers, and was disappointed that they came slightly crispy fried here, similar to a potato pancake.  I'm sure they'd be fine if I had nothing to compare them to.  I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip here, but if you live in the area and can dedicate yourself to becoming a weekend fixture and working your way through the menu, do it.  Oh!  They have take-out here too!",

I had the corned beef hash breakfast. Must have been the scrapings from bottom of the pan. Dried out. Another had the pecan waffles. Looked and tasted like Eggo  frozen, 5 pecans sprinkled on top. Spouse had crepes which came with side of what looked and tasted like Campbell cream of mushroom soup, yuck. Everyone commented what is that? Others had omelette plates but were not impressed. Cost of meal without tip $85. So you're looking at around 100 for this junk. Place is attached to Motel 6, why people are waiting to get in I'll never know. Never again. Better go to the Good Egg, Butterfields on Shea blvd., Cracker Barrel, Denny's, or IHOP. You actually get what you pay for there. Huge ripoff.  P.S. Better have your cellphone turned off or mute lest you be admonished by staff for disobeying their rules. This isn't the Phoenician or Ruth's Chris, give me a break.",

Anyway, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star joint in my book is the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of here for less than $20.  Maybe I'm crazy, but for a traditional American breakfast, I think that's expensive.  That doesn't seem to keep people - including myself - from frequenting the place, but on general principle I need to dock a star.",

Although this is a chain, the individual restaurants must have plenty of autonomy, because there were none of these crazy rules in Vegas. This is the only location in Arizona.   The food is just as wonderful. Yes, the cash thing is completely ridiculous (but they will accept checks with a local address and a local driver's license). But the food is so, so good. I can personally recommend the blueberry pancakes (my old standby), the chorizo (oddly but greatly served with a short stack of plain pancakes), and the cheddar/bacon grits (amazing).   Oh, and don't listen to people who compare this to IHOP. Totally different leagues (this one being far superior).",

As others have pointed out, on the weekends, the wait is super long -- which should tell you something, but if you are just a party of 2, you can skip the line and hit the small counter bar -- it's first come first serve.  As for the food, with a name like \"original pancake house\", the pancakes are about what you'd expect -- nothing short of perfect.  But don't underestimate other menu choices -- my mother, a chef, said they made the best omelette of her life.  Seriously.  At *this* place.  And the coup de grace? Order the bacon cheddar grits on the side to share.  The best grits you'll ever eat.  My only gripe, sometimes, is the wait staff is a little shaky.  I recognize they are super busy, and this is a hole in the wall, but sometimes, I don't feel the love ...  sometimes.",

We were surprised that the waitress offered no concessions on substitutes and never came back to offer to refill water or coffee. The waitress never asked those basic questions, \"do you need anything? Is everything ok?\" The egg was served slightly burned on top and was extremely hard. The general presentation of the food on the plate was very average and far below the impressive presentations from their Atlanta branch. We did get great assistance from the bust boy who got us extra water and offered to refill our coffee. He seemed genuinely attentive but he was obviously assisting outside of his normal capacity while cleaning tables. If you're looking for a special breakfast experience in Scottsdale I would look elsewhere. If you just need to eat, it will do.",

Have tried the apple pancake, salami and eggs, dutch baby, and sourdough pancakes, all which were amazing. Be prepared for a wait though, this place is packed on the weekends - and if you decide to try the apple pancake or Dutch baby they take about 45 min but are well worth the wait. They are both a little piece of heaven in your mouth. The salami and eggs (and most of their other egg dishes) are also a real treat as they are baked which makes them fluffy and delicious!!! Be sure to give this place a try if you're in the area!!!",

In that one, all done with bright colors and modern touches - we liked the food, but we weren't too hip for some of their policies.  So we stopped going - and it appears that was the case with everyone else in North Phoenix too as that funky and cool looking location closed down about 3 years ago or so.    I've only been to this original location once, but found that they seemed a bit less tense on some issues they were more intense on others.  I went during a strong no-cell phone period apparently.  And when work called, which means I had to answer, several folks gave dirty looks.  While I totally get that folks shouldn't have obnoxious rings and talk loud into their ear pieces while walking through the restaurant, that policy seemed to encourage the dirty looks for answering a vibrating phone.  So... I haven't been back.    Based on Selby's review, I may have to go back one of these days because their food really was great - thus the 4 stars.   But I'll try to make sure it's a day when I don't expect to get any calls.",

The Las Vegas location is phenomenal, and after experiencing it, the Scottsdale location doesn't live up to our expectations. The pancakes taste the same (excellent), and some of their daily specials are obviously targeted to local tastes (and prices to local income levels), but it's a total dive. Attached to a Motel 6, it is easy to miss and isn't ritzy like the nearby restaurants at the Fashion Square.   There are \"NO Cell Phone\" signs posted everywhere, and we hear they are strictly enforced, though we haven't had any problems on our visits. The policy seems a bit dated and draconian. Additionally, your soda choices clearly reflect the personal taste of the owner - Pepsi or Diet Coke, only in cans. No fountains, no refills. Coffee is good (and bottomless), but getting extra half-and-half feels like pulling teeth if you like your coffee light.   We've been several times because my wife is addicted, but I could skip it and the 46 mile round trip from Gilbert. The first time we went, we were surprised at the surcharge for items included on the Las Vegas menu (such as whipped cream for chocolate chip pancakes), and the a la carte nature of the Scottsdale menu. Another time the waitress got our order wrong and argued with us instead of fixing it right away.   CASH ONLY. Keep that in mind before going. If you've never been to an OPH you will be blown away by the \"awesome pancakes\" (says my wife), but if you have been to any other location, you will probably be disappointed with the service and prices.",

My favorite is the apple pancake which is baked with caramel and sliced granny smith apples. When it comes to your table pipping hot, it has risen from baking and as you watch it deflate and cool the mouthwatering makes you check your pant leg to ensure you still have a napkin. Make sure you can wait the 40 or so minutes it takes for this one.   While the Jr version of this pancake is still a bountiful portion, I love adding a side of home style fries. They cut the potatoes to about a half inch or so and add onions and bell peppers, so tasty.   As a creature of habit I can at times manage to sway myself to order something else on the menu. The banana pancakes actually have mashed  bananas worked into the pancake batter and it's really spectacular. The Lingonberry crepes sometimes come in handy when I can't scrape up enough cash to go to Holland. The omelets are also baked and worth the time it takes to get to you.

What you'll notice when you first arrive is (usually) a long wait and a bunch of rules.  Cash only.  We'll only seat full parties (or even put their names in line).  Substitutions at a la carte prices.  Sharing requires an additional fee.  Only short stacks of 49er flapjacks on the weekends.  Etc.  Etc.  So the first time you go there, you'll probably think, \"this place may be good, but it won't be *that* good.\"  Well you'd be wrong.  I was.  The food here is bar none the best basic breakfast food you'll ever eat.  It's just perfect.  The strawberry pancakes come with this amazing strawberry syrup that is good enough to eat by itself with dabs of the homemade whipped cream (I know from experience).  The patty sausage is a pure euphony of spices.  My heart skips two beats every time I eat there.  Recommendations: the French crepes.  If you like strawberries and/or anything delicious, have the crepes.  The only, and I mean only problem with them is that they don't come with anything salty so if you want a variety then have a bite of someone else's shit because you absolutely must have these things.  49er flapjacks--thin, chewy, mindbendingly good.  Pecan pancakes.  They also offer many different types of crepes, oven baked omelettes, chocolate chip pancakes, coconut pancakes, blueberry, bacon pancakes, and on and on.  And, if it looks good to you, their specialty is this gigantic apple pancake--but imho it isn't the best thing on the menu.  Same with the Dutch baby.  Look: I know food.  Really.  If you don't like this place, then you are just a hater.  Sometimes you have to look past the rude hostess, the long wait times, and the excessive rules and just enjoy the best breakfast that the city has to offer.  And at least now they have a goddamn ATM in the store.",

    "text": "I recently went with my two favorite guys to the Original Pancake House on a Sunday morning.   We showed up at around 11am and were able to park without a problem. The parking lot is very small, but on our trip only 3 other cars were there.  We immediately noticed the \"cash only\" sign on the door. What kind of place still takes cash only? Especially in Scottsdale, next to the Fashion center, and it's a place that charges $10 for pancakes????  Fortunately there is a cash machine across the street. Once we got our cash we were able to get a table without waiting. I guess that should have been our clue to what type of food/service we were going to receive.  After looking for over 7 years in Arizona for a breakfast place that serves potato pancakes and dutch pancakes I was pretty excited about trying this place out. The ambiance in this place leaves much to be desired, but I wasn't going to complain if the food was good.  Well, the food and service definitely weren't good..... Our server came to take our order, and it was clear she didn't speak any English. Luckily, one of my guys speaks Spanish and was able to relay our order.   We ordered the Dutch Baby, an order of Potato pancakes, a Cheese omelet, and 3 diet cokes.  I nearly laughed when they brought us 3 cans of soda and a glass of ice cubes. What kind of place doesn't have a soda machine? And secondly, you get no refills. Bad news for someone who drinks 15+ glasses of diet coke while eating out like my friend does! (He makes sure to get his moneys worth!).  We waited nearly an hour for our food. When it finally came it was clear that they had timed our order wrong and put all our food in at the same time. The omelet was ice cold, the pancakes were soggy, the dutch baby was pipping hot. Hmmm..... Our waitress?? No where to be found.  We decided to just eat our food. The omelet was probably the best of what was offered, even though it was ice cold. There was a good amount of cheese, and it was a large portion. It also came with a side of pancakes, which were ok, but really just average pancakes. Not too much different from Denny's. Certainly not what you would expect from a restaurant named \"Original Pancake House\".  The potato pancakes were dismal. Soggy, sad, little things that made me nearly cry for my old Minnesota breakfast hangouts. The applesauce was muscleman's brand, which seemed to cheapen the pancakes even more.  The dutch baby, which I had been so excited about was an eggy mess. Dutch pancakes are usually served while still puffy, this one had fell flat 5 minutes ago. It said on the menu it would come with a lemon butter side. I was served butter in a dish and a slice of lemon. Very disappointing.  Over all, the breakfast wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just ok. I realize my expectations were very high. I wouldn't go again, and I wouldn't recommend it. I guess if you are staying at the attached Motel 6 it would probably be a good choice for a quick, filling meal.  If you are looking for a better quality breakfast I would recommend Butterfield's. More ambiance, much better food, the take credit cards, and the prices are much more reasonable.",

    "text": "I have heard lots of rants and raves about the great pancakes at OHOP, which is located in the parking lot of the Motel 6 right by Neiman Marcus (I know...it is an odd block of Camelback Road). Parking is adequate...there were people waiting outside, yet my dining companion and I were able to get parking in the lot, and there is street parking if needed.  We were told that we would have a 20-25 minute wait and were given a ticket with a number. Our number was called about 10 minutes later and we were seated. We were accosted by what seemed like dozens of signs warning us that they don't accept credit cards for payment as we walked to our seats, so I made a mental note to go to the ATM located in the restaurant after placing our orders ($2.50 fee, and more ranting on this later).  The decor is indeed classic outdated breakfast chic. It looks like Mel's diner, but with tables much closer together. We ordered coffee and orange juice and sat down to look over the menu. They have a large variety of pancakes that vary in both batter type (buckwheat, potato, buttermilk, chocolate chip) and topping (banana, coconut, lignonberries). In addition they have a large selection of crepes and omlettes (the oms come with a short stack of buttermilk pancakes).  We received our coffee, which was of the standard generic diner variety, and placed our order. I ordered a short stack of the 49er flap jacks, described as plate-size, chewy, and tender, and added a a side order of potatoes. My friend ordered the \"lacy\" swedish pancakes, which come with lignonberries. He also ordered an english muffin on the side.  Our food arrived and the pancakes were great. My 49ers were chewy, almost creamy, and delicious. The texture and consistency was perfect, and they absorbed the butter and syrup perfectly. They were almost crepe-thin, but were not delicate. My companion spoke very highly of the swedish cakes as well. The potatoes were a nightmare though. In most breakfast situations, one expects a side order of potatoes to be cooked to order, served fresh off the griddle. That was not the case with these potatoes. They had the temperature and texture that indicates they had spent the better part of the morning drying out in a steam table. They were seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of onion and pepper tossed in, and I am sure they were delicious when they were cooked, but by the time they reached my table, they tasted like yesterday's leftovers reheated in a microwave.  The check arrived and the damage was $32. Keep in mind that this is not the place to go for a \"bargain\" breakfast. Our bill included the two pancake orders (mine was a short stack), a side of potatoes, an english muffin, 2 coffees, one juice, and an extra side of berries ($1.50). The pancakes are definitely worth the $7-9.25 that they charge, but there is no reason to go for the side dishes. In all honesty, I prefer the food and atmosphere at a place like Palette if I want a $32 breakfast. The pancakes here are something that I expect I will have a craving for again, though.  Service was friendly and prompt. Our drinks never went below half-full and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  On to the Credit Card issue. I totally understand that businesses don't want to deal with the fees and hassle associated with accepting credit cards, but for a restaurant in a major tourist area where a meal for 2 costs more than $30, it seems silly and stubborn to refuse to accept credit cards. I can almost picture some crotchety, grumpy guy in the back boring his grandchildren with yet another diatribe about how the credit card companies are out to get him. My point is, If you are going to charge an upscale price, you need to accept credit card payment. period.  So overall, 3 stars. It would have been 4 stars had it not been for the steam-table potatoes and the annoyance of paying 2.50 to pay.",

    "text": "Pretty big disappointment for me after all these great reviews praising pancakes of the Gods. Everything here seems pretty average to me, only slightly ahead the likes of Cracker Barrel. I compare it to Cracker Barrel not because it has a ton of crap all over the place and a tacky gift shop, but because the food is pretty flavorless except when they decide to heap on the sugar.  Had the famous apple pancake. Which does have a delicious apple cinnamon topping, but on top of a thick, spongy, bizarre apple pancake. I'm definitely not a fan of the pancake base and the whole thing made me OD on apples and sugar. I think it would be better just to have the spiced apples on the side of a dish.  The omelets are amazingly fluffy and flavorless. I had cheddar in my omelet, right?  For good measure, we ordered some coconut pancakes on the side with the omelet. Pretty average pancakes with a little bit of coconut mixed in and some intensely pineapple syrup. Again I ODed on pineapple without any good pancake substance.  I'm guessing the people who love this place are more into sugary toppings on their pancakes, while I am in it for the cake experience.  Coffee also tasted like it came from Denny's.  To aggravate the situation, this location has all the atmosphere of a Village Inn on sugar roids. Elderly patrons trying to clank there way through all the crowded tables with their walkers, angry Scottsdale douche bags yelling about how stupid it is for a restaurant to not take credit cards, church-goers sequestering large sections for a apple God chasers, and morbidly obese patrons with fashion statements like Tinkerbell sweat pants with a hot pink shirt and crocs and a rainbow Coach purse. It all just made me wish I went to the Good Egg at Park Central Mall instead. Would've cost less too.",

We called ahead to check for closing time because we knew that they only servied breakfast. we were told 2pm. We thought because it was just 11:30 we would try it.   We arrived at a little after 12, we found some of the restaurant had already Ben closed off for the day they did not want to seat us where we wanted to be seated or Service a certain food because it would take too long to cook. The table we were placed at was a very small table and we request a booth, We were actually told by the hostest that they did want to have to clean a table that was already cleaned. I thought that may be the table she was placing us at was not clean and they were not going to clean until after we were finished.  the waitress never came over to Service we had to ask for her to come over.  they were so busy getting ready to go home they neglected (us)the customer. They were ready to close and they let us know it.  We did eat, and when we finished paid our bill which also was over priced and then left with leaving no tip.  The food was a 3, the service was -0. If you are to patronize this place help them out, although they are open until 2 don't go after 12nn  and if you go after 12nn set at the counter then they recognize that you there to help them close on time!!!!",

So what did I end up ordering?...The fluffy spinach omelet...lol  and on the side I got three buttermilk pancakes (comes with the order).   I passed the place two times because the sign is covered with some hedge bushes and it doesn't look very prominent overall (something that actually impressed me!).  They don't have to flaunt their business name, they just let their cooking and service do the advertising!  Luv it! The omelet was perfect, the pancakes were pancakes for buttermilk....The service on point!   Next time, I need to come here with a buddy so that we can share more of the menu...One person is NOT enough!

Pancakes are what one would expect but the small cup of berries only cover one pancake.  So either go dry or add a so, so syrup to the other two.  Syrup was not a good idea.  If you go solo don't expect a booth when it is crowded.  Tight quarters in the center tables and close to your \"new\" neighbors.  Average restaurant coffee (lots of it).  Service OK.  Cash only.

    "text": "The Original Pancake House is tucked away in the corner of Goldwater and Camelback. It's a part of the Motel 6 which kind of makes it hard to find parking during their peak hours.   I arrived there at 10:30 and there was no line to get in. But there were a lot of people already seated. My friend and I were sat immediately, but didn't get any drink orders for 10 minutes and didn't get our food order for another 20 minutes. While waiting for our server to take our order, i noticed that they didn't take credit or debit cards, which happened to be the only thing i had. Luckily for me, they had an ATM machine that had a $2.50 service charge.  When our server finally took our order. I ordered the Biscuits and gravy and my friend ordered the Apple pancakes. The biscuits and gravy plate was only 5 bucks and was enough to fill me up, but i don't think it would be able to fill up someone who would be REALLY hungry. The apple pancake was HUGE! It's just one really large pancake enough for two people to eat.  If you're looking for a cheap breakfast place to eat, this is a good place to go. But as far as service, you'd have to have a little bit a patience. And don't forget to bring your cash because they don't take cards, they're so old fashioned that they accept personal checks!",

Still, the answer was no so I asked to speak with the Manager as sometimes they can do what the waitress cannot. Long story short I got the same response from the Manager even though I also told her I'd be willing to pay an upcharge after she said if they make changes it comes out of their pockets. Pancakes... french toast...I submit the difference in price would be merely pocket change. Again I point out that I was willing to pay an upcharge which would have covered any additional cost to the restaurant. The food was fair and the Waitress was nice but with so many other Breakfast Joints surrounding The Original Pancake House that are willing to work with their guests (I have breakfast out every morning) I will not return to the Original Pancake House ever again for the inflexibility they have shown me. Not so smart are they.",

The food has been excellent and satisfying during every visit, especially  the sweet apple pancake.   But by far my favorite item, which isn't found on the normal menu, is the southern eggs benedict. I've been on a hunt for a wonderful classic eggs bene since I moved to Arizona a couple years ago, but this dish makes a great substitute - a split biscuit topped with bacon, poached eggs, sausage gravy, and served with a hearty portion of hash browns... THIS is southern breakfast at its absolute best, incredibly filling and satisfying.  The service is always fantastic as well - once we were planning to stop by for breakfast but were running late and arrived about 30 minutes before closing. I know this is usually frustrating to restaurant staff but they still seated us anyway and were happy to serve us, and they didn't even want us to apologize for keeping them a bit late after closing. We've been here on many occasions and it's a great experience each time!",

I don't mind modest surroundings for breakfast and the kids won't mind sharing.   This location has been here for awhile, years, and the restaurant has a 1980's ma and pa feel as a result. Perfect for pancakes in my opinion. There's a wall next to the restrooms that has autographs of some minor and some even more minor celebrities. A window looks out onto the Motel 6 pool.   There can be a wait at peak times, and some of the menu items are baked, requiring a more time as well. Budget a little extra time just in case. Pancakes are fluffy. Portions are large. A variety of egg dishes will well satisfy breakfast protein lovers and pancake selections will fulfill any carb craving.  Conveniently located in the shadows of Fashion Square Mall.",

I'm not sure exactly how they did it, but they achieved a steamy hot temperature in perfect unity throughout. It was delicious.     There were options for everyone as well: my wife - hardly hungry as usual - enjoyed a small bowl of fresh fruit while my son practically inhaled his chocolate chip pancakes in addition to my side (more pancakes) after I had only a small bite to taste them.     That bite I was able to snag away from my son was groundbreaking. I used to think that my homemade pancakes (recipe from my dad), were on the top of the world. Clearly, my self proclaimed position does not belong to me, because these pancakes were WOW good!",

When you ask for stronger coffee, they're quick to offer the expensive shot of espresso- clearly a scam that is still paying off for them.    Food was good.  It is too bad.  Raise the prices a nickel and start putting enough coffee grounds in the filter.  Please.",

When he paid there was another lady at the register. When we left someone else was there and I had to show her my husbands bank account to see the pending charge because she wanted to argue with us and refused to believe we paid the other lady. Once I showed her the pending charge from them, she still did not understand and looked extremely confused and said \"How???\"",

    "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant.  So let's start with the positive. There is no better place to get a Dutch Baby pancake.  They are light, lemony and luscious!  They also make a wonderful classic Apple pancake. Both are special orders and take longer to cook, which is well noted on the menu - and worth the wait.   The service is great and attentive. The wait staff and bussers really hustle.  They are always busy and turn over fast without feeling rushed.   Here's my challenge - they are a franchise of the Original Pancake House. So they have the menu, but not the ambiance.  The building is attached to a Motel 6 where my mom worked in the 60's and not much has changed.  It's cramped and a bit dated.   What gets me are the \"rules\" - they are posted everywhere. Minimum 2 people to a booth. No parties will be seated until the entire party is present. Substitutions are priced at ala carte prices - no exceptions.  The hostess is like that grandma that scares the bejesus out of you if you misbehave.  So if you are okay with a lot of rules then this is your place.  Don't ask for any special treatment.    Yet I keep coming back. Love those Dutch Babies!",

Recommend the Fantastic Dutch Baby, strawberry waffles, Potato Pancakes, blueberry pancakes, crepes and great oven-finished veggie omelettes. .. and the list goes on!  A 1950's retro diner that is part of the Original Pancake House chain although Ron the owner has always taken pride in providing exceptional quality food and unique original consistent recipes for over 25 years as one of the original locations. Highly recommend. Can be busy on weekends although always worth the wait.    Diners, Drive-Ins and dives should visit this place soon!",

The pancakes melt in your mouth and are best drenched in full-calorie maple syrup. They have some sort of Apple Pie Pancake that looks incredible- I plan on getting it the next time I go. I also have had the bacon and cheese omelet- which was huge! the omelet was super fluffy and full of thick cut bacon and cheddar cheese. I wish I could eat it everyday.  The only suggestion I would make to O.P.H. would be to let people pay with debit/credit cards. This is a cash-only business and they pretty much make customers use an ATM inside that charges 3 dollars per transaction if those customers didn't bring cash with them. It is a bit ridiculous since most everywhere takes card now. Regardless,I will be going back but stopping by Chase beforehand!",

I have eaten here twice and both times something was wrong with the order, cleanliness, and/or service was very lacking. Very slow, very crowded, and the food is just not that great to keep me coming back. They are also a cash only establishment which is highly inconvenient for me. I have to admit their menu is extensive and the Dutch Baby, awesomeness of that German Pancake was to die for. The other stuff is just regular Breakfast food, and nothing special at that. The first time I went I did not like their pancakes. They was dry and not that great. I am glad I got the Dutch Baby this time around. That thing was darn good!!!!!

Joking, only because I didn't think of it first.   The place is on the smaller size but huge on menu side.  The are plenty pancakes choices,  but crepes won the day.  There were several choices here too.  I went for Cherry crepes. These wonderfully light creeps have a tart cherry filling with sweet syrup.  Three was a good serving size.  Plenty of flavor and a dash of powdered sugar.    It can be a wait to sit but the food was on the table within 10 minutes of my order.  Service was quick and friendly.  Next time I hike, i'll be back",

They had a large selection of pancake options (along with crepe and waffles). He got the Dutch Baby Junior because it was one of their specialities (that didn't take 45 mins to cook).   They DIDN'T have GLUTEN-FREE pancakes, but they DID offer gluten-free TOAST! I love that they were able to have that as a substitute. I ordered eggs and bacon with hash browns. The service was QUICK and our waitress was very kind. It was pretty busy for a Friday morning!   The Dutch baby was crispy on the outside but very gooey on the inside. It lacked flavor, so it relied heavily on the toppings they brought with it (butter, powdered sugar, and lemon). The eggs and bacon were STANDARD and also lacked flavored. Overall, everything was SUBPAR and PLAIN. I would LOVE if they added more seasonings and flavors to their dishes, to create better tastes!",

Instead of putting country potatoes in my burrito, just put hash browns.... super easy. I could of walked in the kitchen myself and given them a lesson if they needed it. And the food was bland and uninspiring. The potato pancakes were tasteless. The omelette was plain and boring. The coffee tasted old and watered down. So disappointed. Oh and don't go here with a group and try to split ur check. They can only split by dollar amount and not by the items ordered. They will tell you to just add up ur own stuff and pay what you owe.

I opted for eggs, sausage and the seasonal pumpkin pancakes and was not disappointed. The pancakes were fluffy and had just the right amount of spices. My hubby had eggs, sausage and potato pancakes which were served with applesauce and sour cream. Also very good. Excellent service as well. No gluten free options, however, which is unfortunate. Maybe that's why they were not crowded on a Sunday at 11 am. I think they need to get with everyone's new diet choices and add a GF pancake, waffle, etc. I bet it would bring in more business.",

We walked in to a wall of autographs of celebrities and locals alike.  Along with scribbles on the wall was their chalkboard of daily specials.  As a \"basic\" girl, I was drawn to the Pumpkin Pancakes.  We were sat promptly, and waited for a few moments to meet our server.  We received our coffee quickly (much needed!). I took my time dressing it, which another server grabbed my creamer and asked \"did you need the cream?\" Yes.  Yes I do, but if I have to share...that's just awkward.  She left my creamer and continued to tend to her tables.  Moments later, breakfast is served.  I was shocked at how tiny my Pumpkin Pancakes were for the price I paid for my meal.  $12 for 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, and 3 4\" in diameter pancakes.  They were nothing to write home to mom about.  They tasted similar to IHOP's.   I believe James Beard let me down on this one.

We were craving pancakes and were excited to find out that there's an OHOP in Scottsdale near Fashion Square, not too far from my apartment in Old Town Scottsdale!  I finally tried the dutch pancake and ordered the Junior Dutch Baby. This pancake was so big and it's the smaller version of the larger original Dutch Pancake! I ordered this and a side of biscuits and gravy.   Service:  My friend and I were seated immediately even though the restaurant seemed pretty busy. It looks like they have more open tables for smaller groups because larger groups of families come here on Sundays for brunch. The waiters were friendly and frequented our table asking to refill our water glasses throughout our brunch.   Food:  *Junior Dutch Baby* the smaller version of the original dutch pancake was still huge! Don't let the name of this fool you. I was only able to eat half of it. I took the other half home. I would say that the dutch pancake tasted like a regular pancake except more eggy.   *Biscuits and Gravy* Two soft and flaky biscuits smothered in sausage gravy. My favorite! I ate half of this and took the other biscuit to-go.  I would highly recommend this place if you don't want to go to IHOP, but are still craving similar breakfast-y type foods. There are a lot of options to choose from the menu. There's something for everyone whether you like a healthy omelet, are craving pancakes and want to stick to the basics, or want to try something new like a dutch pancake.",

    "text": "The Original House of Pancakes isn't a fancy place.  It shares a parking lot with a Motel 6.  It's very simple and clean.  This restaurant offers good service and some of  the very best breakfast food in the Phoenix area.  Today I ordered the Swedish pancakes--thin crepe like pancakes served with lingonberries--and bacon--thick sliced, much higher quality than is typical in such an inexpensive restaurant.  The Swedish pancakes were delicious, and so were the Dutch babies and the potato pancakes ordered by the others at my table.  This place offers pretty nearly every kind of pancake there is.  Everything I've tasted here has been excellent.  This restaurant represents a great value and is a strong 5 star recommendation",

It was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical (cheaper) breakfast joint. We were seated right away but there seemed to be a pretty consistent wait in the small dining room. Our table was in a pretty cramped area which I normally don't mind but few people would ever want to sit that close to my typical frazzled Sunday morning self.   Our food was average. I had a pecan waffle and OJ, the hubby had a short stack of yeast pancakes, home-style potatoes and OJ. It was all OK, our service was good and the check with tip totaled $26 (cash ONLY.) A good alternative to typical breakfast chains but overall nothing that made me swoon over my plate.",

    "text": "I learned this morning that \"Original Pancake House\" and \"IHOP\" are two very different restaurants... and in my mind, \"IHOP\" is much better.  We ended up at this OHOP for breakfast around 11am (on a Sunday).  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and a table within just a few minutes.  Once seated, I noticed how tacky the interior is decorated, but that is no big deal.  The big deal is that the tables are so close together there is not much room to move... and that the place doesn't take credit cards, and if you order a couple of things ala carte like we did, it really adds up...   My short stack for buckwheat pancakes, scrambled egg whites, and OJ plus Jared's eggs over easy with hashbrowns, toast, and coffee cost us $32 before tip.  For breakfast?  Really?  And our waitress could've told us, but no...  At least they made it easy by putting an ATM inside the restaurant now - too bad there is that additional $2.50 fee to use it.    Another difference I noticed is that OHOP offers only one single kind of syrup where IHOP offers many... and the pancakes are better at the latter as well.  The one thing that OHOP has going for them is their Dutch Baby - at least from the looks of it as I saw people around me ordering it.    I'll choose IHOP or one of the many locally owned breakfast places in the future before returning to OHOP.  It was $40 out the door for a simple breakfast for two today... Screw that!",

    "text": "Having been to an Original Pancake House when I lived in Minnesota, I was excited to see a location in Arizona.  I didn't visit this restaurant until my previously favorite breakfast joint stopped serving the Baked Apple Pancake.  I've been here a couple of times for a \"cheat\" meal, specifically for the Baked Apple Pancake. They offer two sizes, a full size and a \"baby\" size. I think most people could split the baby size, but if you are very hungry and want to indulge, a baby size will suit one person just fine. The full size on the other hand is perfect to split if both people want to order something else.  The first time we tried eating here I also ordered a crepe which had some alcohol soaked fruit inside with pecans, served cold, sprinkled with chopped pecans and a side of tropical syrup. If this was refrigerator cold it might have been okay, but it was closer to room temperature, there seemed to be an overwhelming amount of nuts, and it just wasn't that flavorful. I suppose anything compared to their Baked Apple Pancake is sub-par.  The baked pancake though, wow. It is huge and puffy when it arrives, but it does settle a bit. I recommend waiting 2 or 3 minutes before digging in, or else you will burn your mouth and spoil the rest of your meal (don't ask, ha). A good way to do this is to ask for a side of whipped cream (which they will charge you for) as soon as they serve you the apple pancake. By the time the server comes back with the whipped cream, the pancake should be ready for your enjoyment!  Even after settling, the pancake is thick, doughy, filling, and the apples are amazing. If you are lucky, the cooks will have put a little extra brown sugar on top so there will be some crunch, and your experience will be complete. You definitely will feel the need to brush your teeth after eating one of these (not to mention hit the gym), and you probably won't eat for the rest of the day. I don't condone eating these all the time, but once in a while for a special occasion won't make a dent in your daily diet.  A couple things to be aware of; these types of joints make their money on sides, so if ordering sausage, bacon, or another side, the portion size is tiny. If ordering a soda/pop/cola, they serve it by the can (no refills). From the outside the restaurant may not look like much, but it is a great divey breakfast place. It is breakfast place after all, not a 4-star dinner restaurant.  Yay for breakfast.  And most importantly, bring cash; no credit cards are accepted here.",

That said, breakfast in the restaurant world usually comes in the form of 2 genres: The over priced, pretentious, yet marginal quality hotel breakfast... ( Yes, the 15$ egg is alive and well in the USA ) or the greasy spoon so cheesy that even the most hard core of truckers would take a pass.  Happily, the \"Original Pancake House\" in Scottsdale AZ ( about as original as Rays Pizza in NYC ) delivers an extremely diverse and satisfying array of breakfast treats without the feeling you need a Penicillin shot after dining... all at a very reasonable price.   To be truthful, they have things on this menu that I have never seen in chain breakfast joints or snooty hotels...   I had the \"Ron's Special\" - egg scramble with carmelized onions, tomatoes, shrooms & cheese with potato pancakes... a truly satisfying meal!  Last trip here I ate twice... having the French Toast... then the berry crepes.  You couldn't get  a bad breakfast here if you tried!  Only negative, I found the coffee to be a little weak... but hey, food over coffee!  * Point of interest: You can write on the walls here... and yes, I have left my mark!",

I guess some of the magic that it had when I was younger went away when I realized it was a chain and also probably since everywhere started serving 'specialty' pancakes. The BF and I went this morning and everything was fine. We waited about ten minutes, got a booth (almost unheard of on a Sunday with a party of 2!), and sat down. We both got coffee, which was fine, but the BF seems to think that they used to serve real cream with coffee... now it's the standard half and half, but I do not share that memory. I got a short stack of banana pancakes and some home fries and he got the bacon pancakes. His pancakes were good. Mine were alright... the coconut they put on top was a little hard so it gave it a weird texture, but the cakes were good. The 'tropical' syrup that comes with it is pretty gross and I'm glad I tasted it on a small piece before putting it all over the cakes... it tasted like orange rinds.... not my thing. The home fries were tasty, but overpriced at 3$ in my opinion. Overall this place is good, just not great... still way better than Denny's.   PS the rules really aren't that big a deal... maybe people can actually talk to each other over a meal *shock!*",

I have been to two others of these in southern California and they are both 5*s in my book (and everyone I go there with every time I go down to visit). So, maybe I had high expectations. But no, I think they truly earned a 2. They may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me. First impressions are SO important.   We went on Friday morning pretty much during peak breakfast time for most that do not get up at the crack of dawn. It was about 930am. We fully expected a wait for breakfast and as we suspected we had one. The young man functioning as host had a rather unique method. He did not write anyones names down, he just tried to remember who was who and in what order, even as people filed in. I guess it seemed to work ok as we did not hear any fights and got seated in a timely fashion. (Thank goodness for being a party of two and being able to sit at a little table.)  I knew ahead of time what I wanted to order, though I was concerned that it would be too huge for me, would take a long time to cook, and my leftovers would have to sit in the car all day. I ALWAYS order the apple pancakes. They are my favorite. I just love them. Even if they take 30-45 minutes to bake and are humungous. Imagine sauteed apples with a pancake/cake batter poured on it with lots of cinnamon, baked in the oven. Yes, its sooo good. Usually. I was quite happy to see that they had a option of a Junior apple pancake, smaller version of the same goodness I usually like. They should all do this.  SG ordered a regular egg dish, which also comes with some pancakes.   After about 45 minutes, my pancake arrives. BURNT! So, if I had gotten it about 5 minutes earlier, it would have been perfect? Ironic. I thought it would be ok, but I could not eat the charred edges, they just were too burnt. Steve's meal took another  5 minute to come. My meal is the one that takes forever and then its like they forget the other order. I noticed this at the neighboring table and blew it off until it happened to us. They need to time things better. My food would have been cold if I was polite enough to wait.  Our service was also pitiful. I had to get up and get the syrup from the bus station myself. Coffee refills were few and far between too. But, we were headed to a ball game, so we probably did not want to have too much coffee on board. I did notice the service at the neighboring tables with a different waitress appeared to be much better than ours, but I can only rate our experience.   We will likely not be back here. There are lots of breakfast options elsewhere and I can save my Apple pancake as a treat for Socal.",

It arrived piping hot, and it was HUGE. It was very fluffy and loaded with lots of fresh spinach just as I was hoping. It was served with a side of their delicious pancakes, although I hardly had room to do eat more than a few bites of them.  The second time I'd had buttermilk pancakes on my mind, and Original Pancake House definitely has the best, so I decided to go there again. They had bacon pancakes and blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I compromised and ordered a short stack of blueberry bacon pancakes to satisfy both my savory and sweet cravings.

    "text": "Walked in 45 minutes before they closed. Never felt rushed at all. Everyone was friendly to the point that I felt like a regular at the corner diner. I couldn't decide what to have and was told that it was no problem to customize my order. I got the corned beef hash with eggs. For a little more I got the bacon pancakes instead of plain ones. Lordy, I was a happy woman!  The hash was made in house, and some of the best I've ever had. A little salty, but in a good way. My eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! Basted medium. Whites cooked, yolk making a nice runny sauce for the hash. Ketchup and hot sauce were available, but not needed.  Those bacon studded pancakes were CRAZY good. If you like the balance between sweet and salty, fluffy and crunchy, you will love these.  Hubby ordered some crepes with strawberries. He loved them and offered me a bite. I couldn't break away from my plate to try them. I am sorry/not sorry.",

We're going to split these two entrees so it is going to be more than enough. Coffee is good.  Limited soda selection so my dining guest ordered the strawberry lemonade which gets one free refill.  They do NOT take credit card, it's cash only and for your convenience (?) they have an ATM available.  Seriously, why pay credit card processing fees when you can collect money by making an ATM machine available.  :-p  The omelette WAS yummy, the pancake was pretty good but I actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity I had remembered.  Must be aging brain cells.  Service picked up once our waitress finally took our order.   It seems there are plenty of regulars that visit this place.  Heads up on the parking.  It seems as if the parking space is kind of lacking.  It looked as if customers have to park in the street it the small lot is full.  Will we be going here again anytime soon?  Nah, it's not likely unless I have an out of town guest or a hankerin' for another apple pancake.",

If you're coming here for some gluten free pancakes based on the reviews on gluten free websites, the companies website, etc. like I did, be prepared for disappointment. While this chain of restaurants does offer a wide variety of gluten free pancake options, this particular location has a different menu than other locations, which includes no gluten free choices. I'm not just talking about cross contamination, either. I was told all pancakes have wheat flour in them. Even their buckwheat pancakes have wheat flour. The staff was polite enough but I can't comment on any other food, the only reason I came was for pancakes. Based off of the small time I spent here, it seems VERY similar to a Waffle House though.",

We know for a fact he didn't order what was served (he doesn't like chocolate chip pancakes). He didn't bring enough money to pay for 3 meals and therefore he had to settle for something he didn't order.  Shocking!!!

We arrived on Sunday morning about 9:45 and waited just a few minutes to be seated. Our server (Dianne) promptly came over and we got our waters and coffee. We looked at the menu and I was getting more and more hungry reading all the yummy options. As you walk in the front door they had their daily specials. We decided to both get a daily special. I had the Ham Steak, 2 Eggs, Hashbrowns and a Short Stack (Yes I was hungry - LOL) and my boyfriend got the Bread Pudding French Toast. Both were AMAZING! The service was great!!! I will be back to get the Dutch Pancake (takes 20 minutes and it's HUGE).   I also have to say that our server Dianne was AWESOME!!! Hope to have her wait on us in the future!",

A lady who may be the manager said she would turn off the fans but wouldn't let us move. \"The air will blow on you anywhere\" she said. Was the booth reserved? Was the queen coming in for breakfast? No one ever sat in that booth. I also want to mention that we asked for a booth when we first came in. The food took forever to come out. It took about 25-30 minutes. Mind you I ordered one scramble egg and turkey bacon. Everyone else ordered regular pancakes. If their Dutch baby takes 20 minutes why would our very simple orders take so long?

The manager was less than understanding and insisted on the foods freshness (which I never questioned). I only said that it made me sick. He kept going on about how nobody else got sick and I said that was fine, but it made ME sick. He got indignant with me calling me a liar and I had to tell him that I wasn't gonna pay for my food.  Been going to the original pancake house for 20yrs in various states and this is the 1st time I have ever thrown up and the 1st time I have been treated badly.  You can go here if u want, but I will never return.",

This must be a regular occurrence there as the staff seemed not to notice the full table of 'food'. Begrudgingly paid the tab and tipped, as it wasn't the severs fault the chefs are from Craigslist. I can only imagine that this is what soup kitchens during WWII were like when food was rationed and meals were cooked on the same grill and instead of butter they used axle grease or lard from dead prisoners.

The only downside in my opinion is that they sell no Coke. They give a choice of Diet Coke or Pepsi. The orange juice is delicious. I recommend the apple baby or 49er flapjacks the bacon, eggs and other sides are also delicious. This is a very convenient location when traveling to the mall.",

It's not the type of fancy or trendy breakfast place you'd expect to see in these parts of Scottsdale. But it is a classic breakfast place with lots of options - feels like an old-timey mom and pop place. The wait staff were kind and quick, the food was good, overall an enjoyable experience if your just wanting a solid breakfast and not expecting to be wow'd. It's a the perfect place to take your folks or grandparents. And everyone would have a good time.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  Nothing special about this place, located in the front parking lot of Motel 6.  We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the CASH ONLY sign and the NO CELL PHONES ALLOWED sign.  I maybe get the cash only thing since it's in close proximity to a Motel 6, but does a casual breakfast diner type establishment have to tell you not to use your cell phone?  The prices do not equal the quality and definitely not the quantity of their food.  I ordered the bacon waffle ($8.50), but it looked more like a pancake waffle (flat) with, I swear, one strip of bacon crumbled on top.  I did not taste any \"bits of bacon\" inside the waffle.  Bleh.  My friend had the strawberry waffle, also flat, which turned out to be the best tasting thing at the table,  The guys both ordered sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes.  Pancakes weren't bad, but like I said earlier, nothing special.  One of the hashbrowns was forgotten.  Coffee was good.  Service was friendly but average.  Our bill came out to $40, but honestly it wasn't worth it.  The next morning, we drove a little further and found a Cracker Barrel.  And there you have it.",

    "text": "I love the Original Pancake House. This one is super weird, but less weird than it was once upon a time.   My first visit was probably 5-7 years ago. They had a multitude of signs plastered on the door and in the entry \"NO CELL PHONES\" \"CASH ONLY\" \"WE DON'T LIKE YOU\" (I made that last one up, the first two are for reals) They didn't have half of the things I was used to ordering at Original Pancake Houses elsewhere and they had *gasp* bad bacon (cardinal sin for any breakfast place) Additionally, the beverage situation was bizarre... like, I ordered a Diet Coke, hubs ordered a regular Coke, and they came in aluminum cans - one Diet Coke, one regular ... Pepsi? Service was gruff. The orangey/bluey/turqoisey tackiness of the decor made my eyes hurt.   Fast forward to my experience 2 weekends ago... still lots of signs on the door, but I had called ahead to verify and although there is a sign that it is cash only and an ATM just inside, they actually DO take credit cards now, thank goodness. I think there may have been a no cell phones sign, but it doesn't seem as strictly policed (I was able to check in on Yelp and take my obligatory food photos) They even sat our incomplete party --- craziness! It was great. The birthday girl was running a little behind, so we were able to grab a table so that we were ready for her. We were visiting on a Saturday, so I expected a wait and bustling busyness, but while there were other patrons around, it was not jam packed and there was no wait for a table or service. Our server was pretty nice - not bubbly but not grumpy.   The menu seems to have improved - they had plenty of strawberry treats (my go-to choices) and I ordered plain crepes with delicious strawberry syrup. On my last visit, the only syrup option for my crepes was \"tropical\", so I was very pleased with the current situation. Delicious bacon, plus some yummy pancakes, Strawberry Crepes, and Eggs Michael rounded out our orders. Great reviews all around. The beverage service has progressed to normal fountain drinks, which was much nicer than my past experience.  The oddly shaped table was a bit strange (we were on a banquette in a corner and 2 out of the 5 people in our group sat a little awkwardly on corners of the table) and the super tacky decor still hurt my eyes, but overall the place is clean, bright, and generally welcoming.   I will definitely visit again (sooner than 5-7 years from now, I hope) and look forward to more of the breakfast-y wonderfulness I've come to expect from my favorite Original Pancake House locations.",

I don't know why. I've had a plate of bacon literally thrown down on the table at me with a nasty look. I've waited forever even after being seated. Things have been forgotten. But the food has always been good. It is pricey, but if they make it True to what they are supposed to do, there is a reason for it. I was an assistant manager at the one in IL. We made literally everything from scratch. We even melted a 25 lb chunk of butter to make our clarified butter to cook the pancakes on the griddle with. We ground our own corned beef and peeled the potatoes for the hash. The sour dough batter was made from a fermenting potato. The syrups were all homemade. I seriously mean every single thing was homemade. So all this does take time and quality ingredients to make which costs. With that being said, I learned how to make my own apple pancakes at home and we now have them every Sunday with thick sliced bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice for a fraction of what it would cost us to go to OPH.",

Tey must have ordered the wrong thing or been there on a bad day.  I have been going to this place for years since I moved to Phoenix and it is amazing!  I always get the same thing...the 49er flapjacks with strawberry syrup and whip cream!! YUM YUM YUM!!!!  That is not the only thing I have had though...the famous apple pancake that is more like a dessert then breakfast is still infamous there.  If someone orders one you can smell it from the otherside of the restaurant it is amazing!  I would recommend ordering one and taking it home then warming it up later and putting it with ice cream!!! OMG OMG OMG!! The French crepse are amazing and fabulous as well!  Ron's eggs with the potatoes is fantastic if you do not want a sweet breakfast!  Also, the bisciuts and gravy is out of this world!!  I would say this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix!!!  It is very casual you can go there in your workout gear!  I would always plan to wait especially if you go during busy mornings on the weekends!  Crazy crazy crazy!!  I would give up something to be able to eat the 49er flap jacks and apple pancakes everyday!  ITS AMAZING!!! love it!",

Then I asked for one of their signature pancakes and was told they were out. No apology or anything. Then was told they could make a small one. I should have went with my instinct and got up and went somewhere who valued their customers.  I ended up staying and waiting for the food.  It finally came and was disgusting.  My wifes eggs were over cooked and had no flavor.  My signature pancake was like eating a sugar coated sponge.  I couldnt even finish it nor did I want to.

Not surprisingly, the place was packed.  There seems to be a shortage of breakfast joints in the valley.  It took about 30 minutes to get a table, but the turnover rate was acceptable considering how many people were ahead of us.  The server came immediately to get our drink orders as we settled in.  I finally decided on the apple pancake and I am glad I did.  Light and fluffy and not too sweet.  I got the junior size and I couldn't even finish that.  Luckily, my dining-mates helped me finish it off.  The regular size would be good for sharing.  Something else I noticed is that the portion size for the other meals did not seem that big.  I was afraid to get the eggs, meat, and pancake combo, but I think even a petite girl like me can handle it.  Some last talking points:  The decor is very retro homey.  The service is good even with the crowd.  Parking is adequate for Scottsdale.  And remember to bring cash.",
