Too bad the restaurant never rang the bell for our anniversary. So disappointed and definitely will think twice before coming here again. I was so upset that she ignored us that I didn't enjoy my dinner with the love of my life. Truly disappointed. Too bad. Have to find a new location for our special occasions.

The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is quick (though you may have to wait for a table).  While normally I gravitate to New England style seafood, Angry Crab sure hits the spot when I want a big bag of buttery and spicy mussels. Just be careful with the spice level! Start out low and work your way up. Even most spicy food lovers I know don't usually go above level 3.  If you get JK as your server, be prepared for a man who is larger than life! He's a great guy, with a passion for food, and he'll make sure that you're well taken care of.  Also... don't say no to the hush puppies. I may come for the delicious seafood boils, but the hush puppies are my weakness. One of these days I'm gonna get like 10 orders to go.   Be prepared to get messy, but don't worry... they give you a bib. You'll need it.",

    "text": "Heard so much about this place (Mesa Location) and that they had opened up a location in Phoenix...so it was a must try.  We went in about 4 PM which was a perfect time, no a lot of folks yet.  In fact, maybe 3 tables...  We were greeted by Shelby, our server for the evening.  She was kind enough to share the process, since this was our first time.  Just know up front, the whole shell fish (Lobster & Dungeness crabs are on average 1.5 lbs and up)  Well, we ended up ordering a lot of different things, so we could try, everything we ordered for the steamed/boil had the Trifecta Sauce (Kajun, Lemon Pepper & Garlic) with Spice level 2 (Medium-sizzlin).  We ended up with Dungeness Crab, Lobster, Shrimp (Jumbo size) & Crawfish (jumbo size) and added sausage, potatoes and corn on the cob.  We also added, the Catfish Dinner and Hush puppies; needless to say, we took a lot of food home.  The season blend/combo we selected was so tasty and flavorful.  Everything penetrated the shell fish well and the season on top of the shells was so good you couldn't help but suck/lick (sounds dirty, but not meaning to) the shells.  The additional (sausage, potatoes & corn on the cob) that were steamed in carried the flavor well too.  The catfish was corn meal coated and fried to perfection.  It was light, fish was flaky...I would be happy just having the fried catfish dinner alone.  It came with some kajun seasoned fries and those were good too and I'm not a fan usually of seasoned fries.  The hush puppies were ok, they had a nice balance of heat/flavor, but a little too dough or dense for me.  Again, our server was Shelby, a very friendly person and very good about sharing information...which is great if you have never been here.  She was very attentive, I don't think our iced teas were ever low.  The restaurant is very clean and orderly and all tables have the basics, napkins and heavy butcher type paper as table cloths (trust me, it's a good thing and needed if you order from fresh market).  They even have a wash sink in the dining area for you to clean yourself up afterwards, so cool....As we wrapped up our meal, it was starting to fill up and folks waiting; so timing is everything.",

The environment is loud because that's their thing and that's okay! If you order their seafood, they steam it fresh in a bag with your choice of marinade/sauce and then bring it out to your table...in that same bag! You have to reach in and get your hands dirty but don't worry, they give you bibs. Your table is also set on a piece of butcher paper so the mess is easy to clean up, just go for it! My boyfriend and his father ordered the snow crab and mussels and they enjoyed it all thoroughly.   I decided to take the road a little less traveled and went for the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was really yummy topped with coleslaw (my fav way to have pulled pork) and the side of fries were well seasoned.   When someone orders the King Crab they ring a loud bell and chant. The first time it happens it's a bit startling but you get used to it as your meal goes on. I can't wait to head back and try some crab myself!",

I'm not really certain.  I would get it again though.  The cornbread was the best I've had; I scored some extra to take home.    I was disappointed in the size of the pieces of cod that came with the cod basket.  Maybe my expectations were ill focused but I was looking for something more the lines of a breaded fish fillet and these were more like slightly oversized fish sticks.  The cajun fries were good but the seasoning overpowered everything around it, both in terms of aroma and flavor.",

We went to Angry Crab Shack for our first dinner in Phoenix. We promised to each other that when we came back from Grand Canyon we would go there twice, and we did! I am a guy who get used to spicy food, but I could hardly afford the hot level here. Medium level is okay for both of us, and we think the level allows you to taste the real flavor of the seafood.  We ordered seafood only. I think it is enough to experience this restaurant. I am still looking for a restaurant like Angry Crab Shack even when I come back to Chicago!",

    "text": "Okay here's the thing.   I love this place.   The first time I came here it was pure bliss. My man and I polished off four pounds of seafood and every last bite was unbelievable. We even had room for dessert, which was also delicious! Service by Ashley (I think?) was awesome! She was sweet, informative and prompt.   On our second time here we came for my man's birthday and it was not as pleasant of an experience, unfortunately. Our servers (Brandon and his trainee, didn't catch her name) were great. Fast and friendly! Food? Still unreal. This time we had five pounds of seafood, multiple shots and cocktails. This is where things went sour for us. Problem number one: we asked for two Irish car bombs and they came out as two full beers and they were short on shot glasses so one shot was in a plastic cup (no big deal) but how am I supposed to chug a bomber short with a full beer?!!! Weird, but nothing to be upset about really. Next I ordered two of the same type of drink, the Dixie Peach, but since I CANNOT drink tequila I asked for mine with vodka. When they came out the girl who dropped them off was not our waitress, so I asked which was vodka and which was tequila, to which she had no clue. So I smelled and tasted both, as well as my boyfriend and they we're definitely both tequila, so we sent one back with no more than two sips depleted. The bartender, Miranda, proceeded to come over and pretty much argue with us that one was vodka. Look, I don't want anything comped, I'm not looking for q handout. I just want the drink I ordered!! I was offended that I was being argued with over something so easily fixable. I work at a bar and I give impeccable customer service, and I've never even considered arguing with a customer, even if I thought they were wrong!   Overall this place is unbelievable! Brandon and his trainee are fabulous and deserve to be rewarded for their candor. I wish I could give it five stars but service is a priority to the fullest to me. And sadly today I have to dock a star for the bartender's attitude toward the situation.   The manager, Derek, was super kind when we brought it up to him. We didn't expect anything in return and he was polite, listened and even gave us a $25 gift card for our next visit, which we did not expect!  Thanks to him for being the man!   We will be back",

    "text": "Last week, I was trying to come up with a great new place to try for dinner with friends... The Southerner in me could not have been more thrilled to find the Angry Crab Shack off of Camelback!!  The place looks unassuming and chain'ish from the outside, tucked away in a strip mall... but after reading the reviews here, we were ready to give it a try. There is plenty of parking, and we were there around 6PM on a Thursday, which meant no waiting for a table. The family-friendly atmosphere was apparent, as we watched kids and adults alike drawing on the walls and their tables.  As soon as I saw the menu, I knew that alligator nuggets were happening! I've had them a few times before, and these were great! The flavor is a lot like chicken, while the consistency is slightly chewier (like shrimp). This is a great place to try it if you've never had gator before!  One thing I've really missed from home is having a good, cajun seafood boil, and WOW did this place deliver!!! We ordered the veggies, mussels, snow crab and shrimp, with the trifecta flavoring and a spice level of \"2\" on a 0-5 scale. I'm a spice-lover, and this was just right for me! The crab legs were a hands-down stand out, and the mussels weren't far behind! We loved the shrimp and veggies too, but agreed that next time, we'd probably forego them for more of our favorites! The consumption process is (as with all good boils!) a little messy, so we just poured it out on the table and went to town! (Maybe don't dump all of the sauce, but the rest is fine on the butcher paper.) We stuffed ourselves, enjoying every bite!! It was well-complimented by my Abita purple haze, which I was happy to find on draft. The butcher paper and sink on the side of the room made for an easy post-meal clean up, so that in no time, we were sitting at a nice, tidy table again.  We'll definitely be back soon, and next time, I'll add some red potatoes to the bag! Yum!!",

My waitress was prompt and friendly and chatted me up once I told her it was my birthday and I was in town for work.   I ordered a gumption hard cider which was only $4 and two pounds of snow crabs. I added two corn and two potatoes.   The crabs were well seasoned on the outside but lacked the flavor inside that I was craving. Luckily, there was enough juice flowing that I dunked my crab in that and was satisfied. FYI, I like a lot of heat, but the medium trifecta was spicy! Definitely keep that in mind when ordering so you don't find yourself gagging and unable to enjoy your food.   The corn and potatoes were good, although I felt I got super mini potatoes and for .50 ea, I needed two more to actually feel like I got a deal.   I truly appreciated that my waitress hooked me up with free cheesecake and didn't embarrass me by outing to the whole restaurant that it was my birthday.  I'd definitely recommend this place to others. Good eats and fairly priced!",

For people who lived in Los Angeles, this is similar to the boiling crab except with some bbq as well.  The thing that was not cool: that siren/loud blasting thingy that goes off for...birthdays that would be my guess? First time was okay but after the 3rd time it definitely ruined my dining experience.  Next time: take out only!",

Despite being a group of 12 of us, they accommodated us with a smile. My first time I ordered the Head Off Shrimp EZ Peel Shrimp, with the trifecta sauce in hot. I added corn, red potatoes, and sausage. Along with a order of corn bread. The food was so flavorful and delicious. The corn bread is hands down the best I've had. This time around, I ordered the same as my first time, but decided to try the sauce in Angry Ghost. The sauce was very spicy, but flavorful at the same time. As much as it burned my mouth, I couldn't stop eating it. Aside from the food, the service during both of my visits was nothing short of amazing. Special shout out to Miranda for being so attentive and energetic. It was was contagious. Definitely will be returning and possibly turning it into a Friday tradition.",

Of course they removed the paper foil and put his food in a bowl per our request. They also gave him a discount. I had a wonderful time here, but my advise to this place would be for them to stop putting paper foil underneath customer's food. Overall, I liked coming here.",

    "text": "Okay, where to start? We love this place, at this location alone I would bet we have spent at least $1,000. I want to say 4 to 5 stars for ALMOST all of our experiences.  The weakest point is they cannot seem to bring all of the table orders out at the same time, nine out of ten fails.  Have you ever gone to dinner and watch everyone eat practically all of their food and yours doesn't arrive?  Me neither...until today! We went for an early dinner (3:45 PM ish) and my wife ordered a shrimp boil bag and I ordered a blue crab po' boy with an onion ring upgrade.  Wife gets her food about 13-15 mins. in. No po' boy. Our server was Destiny, very kind and friendly, comes by about 8 mins. later and says I'm checking on your food, a another 10 mins. or so...she comes by says it should be ready, I said just cancel the order.  2 mins. later she drops off my food and says she spoke with the manager and she was going to comp the meal! That was a nice gesture...but, my sandwich was inedible due to how burnt it was. I ate two onion rings for dinner. Destiny returned and asked if the manager came by, she/he had not. She let us know her shift was over, but the manager was going to take care of the bill for us.  This is where my biggest complaint comes in...the manager ghosted us! Did not come by, bill delivered by our busboy(??) and they did remove my meal.  We would have appreciated a visit...maybe an apology...maybe a plea to not let this experience dissuade us from EVER coming back? Poor choice by the manager on duty, who could apparently use some training on customer service/retention. Hopefully, just one horrible experience. Hopefully, they can sort out bringing the entire tables food more timely. We will go back...we will keep eating at the Ahwatukee location as well, we enjoy the food when we get it!",

Why would anybody want to pay $17 to work to eat a lunch and create a mess all over yourself?? Or maybe the waiter should explain that to you before you order.

I couldn't help myself to keep comparing this place to the hot n juicy on mill.  I haven't tried their bbq, I had the lb of shrimp with red potatoes and sausage and the food presentation is practically the same as hot n juicy (served by the lb in plastic bags) the only thing we didn't get that was redily available at hot n juicy was gloves. Didn't really think too much about asking for them because we were starving!!   The specialty drink I ordered was called the ruby red, they used deep eddy vodka which I've never heard of but it tasted fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. Kid friendly, and our server Ashley was extremely kind, observant and efficient.",

    "text": "This is in my neighborhood so I figured I had seen a bunch of friends posting pictures of crab legs and what not on instagram. So I thought me and the gf would check it out.   So lets just say it was not what I expected. It was extremely busy about a 15 minute wait, this was around 9pm on a Friday night, I would almost suggest going later to miss the end of the happy hour crowd. They take your number and text you when your table was ready, but I never got the text, they just came out and called for me when our table was ready. I would highly suggest if your going to go on a weekend night to call and reserve so you don't have to wait. And this place is loud, you can barely hear the person across the table from you, I would not say it is a good place to bring kids, or for intimate conversations. Most of the crowd was couples and groups of young people eating dinner, very few families, and allot of the area hipsters hanging out at the bar.   So my gf got the pulled pork Sammich and I got the alligator basket we both got gumbo. The gumbo was good, I know they use bay leaves in the cooking process but I wish that they would strain them out before serving it. I just don't like them. Nothing like biting into a big old bay leaf. But otherwise the gumbo was pretty good, served hot, but I would have preferred whole pieces of sausage and shrimp, it seems like the sausage was chopped up to small pieces and the shrimp was in pieces too, I never quite got a whole one. All in all it was very good and served piping hot, It comes in like a plastic Tupperware type serving dish so you can put a cap on it and take it to go if you want.   My alligator was seasoned quite well, but it was a bit fried too long, which dried it out and it was a bit disappointing, when you fry alligator, they need to be more flash fried when cooking it, alligator is a white meat, and it doesn't hold moisture well so if you over fry it, it dries out quite a bit, that's what happened to mine anyhow. This place would of got 5 stars if it was not for that. Overall the the food was good, the Cajun fries were heavily seasoned, was not to big of fan of the potato salad, should maybe try the coleslaw next visit.   The service was good, our server Cassie was very informative, and was sure to keep checking on us and made sure our beverages were kept full. I wish she would have offered to give us a marker I would have like to put some graffiti on the walls like most other people appeared to do. I am a fan will definitely come back soon for the crab or lobster. I suggest giving it a try.",

I ordered the king crab (1 lb) with medium trifecta sauce with potatoes and corn. It was delicious and the flavors were on point. The potato is small, so if you want, order a few. They also give you a rock and scissors to help get the meat out of the shell.  I highly suggest the trifecta sauce. I think the medium spice level wasn't too hot but still super flavorful. The mild wasn't as flavorful in my opinion. But regardless, I would eat anything with that sauce.   Overall, it's a place for good company and great food. I will be back for more.

I ordered the shrimp and sausage at level 3, and she told me about their level 6, so I ordered it on the side. The 3 was great but if you like a little more heat get the 6, I mixed the whole thing in my bag and it was awesome. Definitely recommend this place. Also a great place to watch games, tons of TVs.

The server was good, but the kitchen was not so much.  (Different servers brought out the meals at different times - I REALLY dislike that!) So with the mixing of staff we had - Missing coleslaw, (my Brisket came with a piece of Texas toast) my cornbread showed up AN HOUR after I got my meal....??  Wife loved her bag of seafood, mom liked her clams and dad was OK with his catfish.

FYI - shrimps may come with the head for those who are afraid of shrimp with head-on.  Raw oyster - Angry crab usually doesn't offer multiple selections of oysters.  I wouldn't recommend the grilled oysters here, they just don't do it right, but their raw oyster is ALWAYS fresh, and they haven't failed even once!  I am impressed because not every seafood restaurant can keep up the freshness standard on raw oyster.  Clams - Hit and miss.  I will be nice and post a \"fresh clams\" photo here but once a while you will get those \"out-of-date\" clams in the bag.  I got the bad ones from Angry Treasure Special but I am not sure if that's the reason.  Snow crabs - Fresher than the ones from buffet that's for sure.  This place also have great selections of beers and the service is always superb.",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews I decided while I was in Phoenix that I would definitely check out Angry Crab. OMG-it was so good, in fact it was so good that I made another trip there before I left Phoenix. The first night I went there I had Justin as my waiter. He was an excellent waiter and he had the best personality. He gave us excellent customer service. I ordered the level 3 which is suppose to be hot, it wasn't (but it was still good). We ordered, lobster, shrimp and two types of crab. Out of everything the snow crab was my favorite. The second time I went I had a waiter that wasn't very good (cannot remember his name). This time I ordered the level 4 of the snow crab. The waiter kept trying to talk me out of getting it and kept telling me that I wouldn't be able to eat it. Also I wanted kajun (their spelling), traditional boil and garlic sauce. The waiter kept telling me I should get the trifecta (which I didn't want) and then he tells me that he has never placed an order like that (WTH?!). He then proceeded to tell another table what I ordered and they all looked at me crazy (which I found very rude and unprofesional). The order came and OMG level 4 was what I wanted and needed! Eating my snow crab and drinking my Stella I was in heaven. The waiter was shocked that I could eat and finish the crab at that level (whatever-I like hot and spicy food). Seriously why should you care what I order as long as I pay for it?! If I ever travel back to Phoenix this will be the first place that I go too but I would try and find Justin's section.   Some advice: wear something you do not care about and wash your clothes immediately. I wore something I didn't care about but the smell stayed in my clothes for awhile. I had to have the hotel clean them because I couldn't take the smell anymore. Also if you go during the week early you will not have to wait. Go on a Friday night at 7:30 and you are going to wait 45-60 minutes to be seated.",

No waiting in line around 5pm. (Just FYI the line was forming around 7pm) They do have a happy hour for appetizers and drinks in the bar area, and drinks only in the main dining ($1.00 off all drinks). We had Ashley and she was great. She was always refilling our drinks and she was very personable. She made the whole experience enjoyable. The seafood was out of this world. It was excellent. Our party shared a 1.5 lb lobster, 1 lb mussels, 1lb snow crab and 1lb shrimp. You order by the pound, add your seasonings (highly recommend the TRIFECTA) and the amount of heat (level 2 was perfect). The food was hot, tasty, and cooked to perfection. I will be back!",

    "text": "It was my friend's graduation from college, and she, having lived in Louisiana, wanted something authentic. We picked Angry Crab on 28th street.  The atmosphere is awesome and authentic, and we had a good time. Unfortunately, the food was good, but less than amazing. She told me that the breading on her shrimp was so thick, that there was no shrimp taste. Her mother had the catfish, which she liked, and her dad had the BBQ which was good but not memorable. So, in summary, I think GOOD, SOLID, AUTHENTIC are the words that best describe the food and experience. However, for what we spent, I would have hoped for a more tasty experience, meaning that the flavors should be less heavy and should be more refined and distinct. And finally, for me, I will probably seek a new place rather than visit again.",

The bartender was extremely nice and took my order and set up my placemat. Brought out my hush puppies while I waited for the remainder of the food and to my surprise I look over and a baby roach walks right across my placemat and to the straws and etc on the bar.   I call one of the guys over and he says he is going to get a manager but in the meantime I get a better view of the roach and call the bartender over so a team member can actually see it with their eyes. She lifted the straws and surprise... there goes the roach. It scatters and we don't know where it ran to so she goes to get the manager as well.   The manager comes back after hearing from 2 team members and walks up and acts like he has no idea what is going on. I tell him that a baby roach just made its presence at the bar and he ask what I would like to do. He tries to explain the roach away by saying they just sprayed and that's when they like to come out. Also that it rained last night and they keep everything clean (please go sit at the bar and just start looking around) I told him I have lost my appetite and am not interested in continuing a meal. He says he will take it off and leaves to the register.   I stood there awkwardly and was not really approached again. The bartender looked apologetic but I never heard or received and apologies for the experience from the manager or acknowledgment that I have now wasted my time to not only stop by but also did not leave accomplished with a full belly of crab.   Was very disappointed in the establishment and looking back feel like I should have made a bigger stink and possible scene so that the other ppl in the establishment would be aware of the little critters around them.",

He was pleasant and very helpful in explaining what was in the sauces and how the food is served. If you have ever eaten at a 'Boiling crab or Claw' this experience is very similar. Order by the pound and it comes in a bag.  Their selection of items seems pretty good. Head on Shrimp, snow crab, king crab, blue crab and a bunch of other stuff that I can't quite remember. Then you select a seasoning, and then a sauce. I went for the combo sauce and I went with a sauce that was 'scorpion pepper' based (#5 out of 6). Now I eat a lot of hot stuff but this is one of the rare times that it was actually hot. The best thing is that it also tasted good. What a great combo of heat and flavor.  If you want to some good seafood in a casual environment, go here. I highly recommend this place.",

Must have the trifecta sauce if you are doing the seafood feast with the corn and potatoes. I have had the shrimp with trifecta and it was delicious.

Oh my stars this sauce is everything. You can rank the spice of your sauce 1-5. We got the 3 (I can't feel my lips). It was very accurate. The beers we got on draft helped us with the spice. If you like spice I would say this is a good option. If you can't handle any spice I would probably recommend the 1, or even the 0.  We ended up getting two pounds of snow crab, added sausage and corn, and real butter. I think we got fries? I don't remember, the crab was the star, we ended up ordering another 2 pounds of crab.   We left so pleased with our experience. The waitress was really nice and helped up find some spots to go to for the rest of our stay in Phoenix.

We had a pound of king crab, the pulled pork sammy, sides were sweet potato frys, mac n cheese (so bomb), bbq beans, cat fish with cajon frys, and to top it all off this amazing red velvet cheese cake. Everything was mouth watering good.. by the end of our meal we had order an extra pound of king crab and the mac also to go... telling you all, it's so good!!! Crab seasoning is on point and the mac so cheesey!!  Our server was Jeff-- thank you so much for your great customer service and suggestions on places to check out and routes to make the most while traveling to Sedona/Grand Canyon. He really took care of us! Thank you Jeff!     ....can't type Any more as I drive back to AZ just for this meal!! Seriously, it's that good!",

I started off with calamari sticks for appetizer ($9 for about 7 sticks) which were great but really wished they gave more.  Then I order a pound of snow crab legs and a pound of shrimp both with the special trifecta sauce and level one on spice and level three on spice.  I am warning you, the spices here are not a joke so if you're not good with spices like me, stick with a 1 at least and 2 if you want more of a kick. You will eventually start sweating but hey, it's worth it cause the food is so fresh and delicious!   Highly recommend everyone to check this place out! You will not be disappointed",

I will add, the spice level matters more if you order the veggies. They soak it up more than the crustaceans, so I'd go one down on your veggies. Great flavors. They were out of crawfish, so I had the shrimp with trifecta sauce. They don't do half pounds or mix and match, so come hungry! Service was great too.",

Yes, I'm a sauce whore, but I like to try my meats w/o first - then compliment them with appropriate sauces.  But when you claim to be both a crab shack and bbq joint - and you only have one sauce that's almost cloyingly sweet, you make it impossible to give you that 5th star.  Oh - and the siren that gets fired up every time someone does some thing that I don't care to know?  Yeah it gave me a headache.  And I'm not the guy that complains about loud noises, but this was every few minutes and in an already louder than average environment.  That said - the boils are delicious and you should totally try them - just don't bother with the bbq.",

I know businesses are trying to make money but this place is ridiculous.  Don't order the cornbread it cost a dollar in the damn thing was a little bit bigger then my thumb. I thought it was a joke at first but they were serious. It seems the more a place charges the more customers they get. I dont understand it. The food really wasn't good enough to justify the prices they charge. But at the same time I encourage everybody to at least try something once just because I feel this way about this place don't mean you will. But at the end of the day it's going to boil down to whether you want to make that house payment car payment or have a plate of food from this place lol",

We put our name on the list and sat down at the bar, about 20 minutes later we were seated. So, not too bad of a wait. I was immediately surprised at how loud it was, and the music was I guess fitting for the environment but definitely not my cup of tea. Our sever Coral was sweet, we ordered a 1/2 lb of brisket with hush puppies and coleslaw, and a 1 lb bag of crab legs with three potatoes and a bag of veggies. The amount of brisket was amazing, and pretty tasty. The hush puppies were the table favorite. Then out came our bag of seafood! I got the trifecta, and a 1 level of spice. The crab legs were delicious, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked. I think the spice level was a little low for me, it still had delicious flavor but I will go to a 2 next time.   I think what annoyed me most was the music was super loud, where I was screaming at my date and then I think every time someone does a level 5 or whatever they set off alarms which are also ridiculously loud.   The food was good, service was pretty good (though the timing wasn't great and I got a pen that leaked ink all over me in the end) the ambiance wasn't my favorite though. I think also the benches need to be wiped down too because we were seated at a really greasy booth with hand prints all over.  I will be back because it's the central location to me, but probably during the day or something to see how it is!",

So I ended up with wings & a basket of cod. This is what I would say: No to the cod, unless you apply 2 full lemons and a bottle of hot sauce. No to the wings. It seems as if they make them with the same coating as the fish. No to the beans... Too sweet. Yes to the fries. They're golden goodness. In the meantime they have a board with things they don't have... I have never seen that before. And there was like an event where people were screeming and using loud machacas. My ears hurt. They tried to sit me on a table next to the bathroom, which I did not appreciate. And my server was like a shooting star... A rare sighting. This was not a good experience, so I don't care for coming back.",

    "text": "Seafood was ok. Experience wasn't great.  After speaking with the manager about the unsatisfactory timing of food service we were told their protocol is to serve what is ordered by the pound as it finishes cooking. All-in-all, that makes sense. However, if wait staff aren't trained to take the time to \"time/pace out\" the order (as is procedure in more upscale dining) then they need to inform patrons of this in advance. Simply \"food is served as it finishes cooking and some items take longer than others\".  Let me paint a picture...man orders catfish and his date orders shrimp and crab by the pound. Man's catfish arrives within 5 minutes of ordering, meanwhile her shrimp arrives 20 minutes later and the crab another 5 minutes later. To be considerate, man waits to eat his meal until her's arrives. Well, that means his food is room temp at best. Or, the other option - man could simply be rude and eat his meal in front of her. That's a really, really poor approach to foodservice. Simply timing the catfish properly could have avoided it. And, certainly, it doesn't make for a great date/first impression. Just warning you in advance.  Regarding the food - the catfish was tasty, the shrimp were about 1 minute overcooked (too firm/rubbery) and the crab was good. The concept of choosing your custom sauce is fun, but the heavier flavors can take away from the delicate seafood flavor that many of us look for. What's more, everything starts to taste the same. Garlic/butter may be your best bet.",

Could have used more dressing, a little dry for my taste, but I guess some people like it like that. The seafood was interesting with lots of choices of sauces to go with it. Service was very good an attentive even though it was busy.",

So 3 of us ordered about 5 pounds of seafood for my birthday...mind you.  The feast included shrimp, snow crab legs and lobster and it was awesome! And yes, we ate it all. You would think we would've been stuffed, however, we had to try the charred oysters too.  Oh and there was cheesecake too and the \"out of tune' birthday song from my friends.  This location does get packed quickly but they do not take reservations for groups under 15 so expect to wait.  All in all, it was a great birthday dinner.",

The cajun fries are pretty awesome, though. My friend had the mussels in the #2 sauce with corn and sausage and he was pretty damn satisfied with his meal. He also did have an oyster shooter, two beers, and a shot on a Sunday morning so overall, he was in a good mood.  Our waitress, Shelby, was awesome. Super helpful and funny.  Good selection of beer gives this place a star.  If you've had Boiling Crab before, then this place is comparable and with better beer selection. It's definitely worth a try.",

When we were seated our waitress gave us our menus and we ordered some drinks which all came at separate times. Then when we were ready to order we waited and waited. Finally got our order in and needed refills by that time. Waitress walked past us many times with my husband having an empty cup. We asked for a refill and another waitress came over to bring it (my husband said thank you very much) while she rolled her eyes and walked away. I never knew asking for a refill was such a bother. We were with our friends and we all received our meals 15 minutes apart. So by the time one of us was more than halfway through our meal, the next person got there's which I've NEVER been to a restaurant that has this sort of system and I'm sure they don't normally operate like that but it was pathetic. I'm sorry but I can honestly say I won't be back unless they get rid of the miserable, unhappy, staff they have serving people.",

They have all the sports games playing on TV's all around the restaurant. We once asked them to change it to a game we wanted to watch and they did. I always order the shrimp with medium spice and it's perfect. Warning though! If you like to eat spicy food but it not be too hot to where you can't eat it comfortably, then medium spice is good enough. They serve you the food in a bag which was surprising the 1st time you go but after you enjoy the food and return, you wont think about it at all. I like going to this location even though it's a bit far for us because they mix the spices the best out of the 3 different locations I have been to so far. If it's your first time trying Angry Crab,  I definitely recommend you try this location first. It's also great for a group date since they serve BBQ as well. In the event someone doesn't do sea food, your friends will always have the option to eat anything on the BBQ menu side, which I heard is also good but I have yet to try. This is truly on of my favorite places to eat. I definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try it.",

The food was mediocre, I've been a fan of crawfish and love hot and juicy as well as boiling crab. This is not even in the same category .

Catfish was very moist and tender and the pepper-forward breading was good but a bit greasy.   I have no experience with the \"fresh\" seafood here so cannot comment.  They were also out of ribs the day I was there. Not sure how a BBQ place runs out of ribs??",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place - and in fairness, the service was fabulous (great waiter) and beer was nice and cold.  But I went for the \"famous\" crab legs.  Maybe it's a Phoenix thing .... but I've never had a messier bunch of crab legs.   We had a group of about 8 ... and started with appetizers.  The wings were barely average-served very wet.  The fried clams were excellent!  I haven't had fried clams in ages and as a New Englander, I've really missed them.  Angry Crab steams their food in bags and then the bags are served at the table.  We had two orders of veggies - Pacific Rim and Lemon Pepper. Everyone but me loved the Pacific Rim.  I couldn't eat the Lemon Pepper as they were swimming in so much butter I found them just a soggy drippy mess.  We also ordered two bags of shrimp and two bags of crab legs.  The shrimp were mealy and the crab clusters were exceptionally small.  And again, served soaking wet - over seasoned - and frankly completely overpowered what should be the natural sweetness of crab legs.  If I ever went back, I'd skip on their trifecta and see if just one seasoning would be less intrusive.  I know a lot of people love this restaurant.  But for me, heavy handed spicing and sloppy sauces doesn't make for great seafood.  Did I mention the beer was nice and cold?",

I'd suggest trying the kettle chips w brisket topping. The chips never get soggy because they're gone before you know it!   Overall awesome spot for Cajun / Seafood Bag Boils.",

    "text": "I don't normally write reviews, but I felt my experience at Angry Crab warrants one. My family and I went there this past Saturday night upon hearing great things. At first, I was not impressed. It was a typical Saturday night with a wait time of 30 mins for a party of 4. Well somehow the hostess over looked us, so we ended up waiting almost 45 mins (while watching other people get sat, who had gotten there after us). By the time we sat down, we were a little irritated.   If it had not been for the GREAT service from our waitress (Nicole), I would give this place 3 stars. Our waitress was on point. She was energetic, funny, and addressed our concerns immediately. She explained the menu to the point where we understood how to order, and she gave us recommendations as well. This was great after being \"greeted\" by another server, and that server never came back. When Nicole saw us just sitting there, she immediately dropped what she was doing to come and take care of us (and believe me, she was busy!). We saw several other servers walk by without acknowledging us...it left us feeling awkward. Up until our waitress took our order, we felt overlooked.Although she was busy, she took her time to explain things and answer our questions.  We decided to start off with an order of the Gumbo, and then ordered the King Crab with the traditional boil sauce, and added all of the fixin's to the bag (Sausage, corn, and red potato). It was amazing, but the boil bag was a little short on the traditional boil sauce. Either way, it was still worth the 45 minute wait. The best part of our experience here, is that once we ordered our food we never had to ask for anything else. Our waitress brought everything out we would need ahead of time, and we never even had to ask for refills. She brought gloves, crab crackers, and bibs. The excellent service here will definitely bring us back. Not only is the food amazing, the atmosphere is fun (yes, it's very loud...especially if it's your birthday) and our server was one of the best servers we've ever had. Cheers to Angry Crab BBQ Shack!",

But don't worry they have a washing station nearby so you can clean up quick like.  It was my 1st experience with a crab boil ever, so I leaned on friend's advice on which way to go, I knew I wanted Snow Crab and with great help I went with the trifecta level 2, now this had some great flavor man it was delish, but next time I think I will kick it up a bit and try the heat level 3.  It was one pound of Snow Crab at market price, which at that time was 15 bucks, honestly that's not bad at all if you think about how much a good meal would cost you elsewhere.  The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!  I also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.  The Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!",

    "text": "I think I may actually like Angry Crab better than Hot N Juicy ...  For only being open for 3 days, AC has seem to have it down. A crowded restaurant, but didn't have to wait too long for seating. They have the Cajun style seafood with the addition of fried sides and even BBQ.  Of course I had to try their Trifecta sauce and shrimp and decided to go for the frozen crawfish and Tamarind sauce just to try- both with Medium heat. The latter you should pass on. Also decided to try their fried soft shell crab with cajun fries and some soda.  Their shrimp seems so much bigger here, fresh and their Trifecta sauce was well balanced. Their sauce isn't too liquidy or dry, overly salty but good cajun flavor.   Pass on the Tamarind sauce as it was overly salty, way spicier than Medium and had a strong fishy taste to it. Nothing close to what Tamarind really tastes like, the frozen crawfish is to be expected. Dense and not fresh tasting- but I knew that ordering it for $8 a pound.  Great service! Checked back on often, refilled drinks and I love that they provide lemons or limes and all kinds of hot sauces.  Can't wait to come back to try some of their BBQ! It does get pretty rowdy in here, if you're looking for that kind of environment as well.",

We dropped my grandmother, who is 85, off at the door with my uncle while my mom and I parked. By the time we got inside my grandmother had already put her name on the list. She was quoted a 30-40 minute wait, so she found a seat right by the hostess stand. 15 mins later I realize everyone around us who came in after us had already been seated. When we approached the hostess stand to ask what the deal was, the young girl says \"we've been looking for you, your table has been ready for a while\". Oh really? You looked for us? We were sitting literally 3 feet from you the whole time. Not a great experience off the bat. Word to the management: your host staff needs some training. Not all of your guests will have a cell phone and it would be helpful if the first person your customers come in contact with has some amount of common sense.   Once we were seated things got better. Our waitress Kayla was attentive and super helpful in explaining the menu. This place is very similar to Boiling Crab, which I've been to, but the rest of my party was unfamiliar. We ordered a lb of shrimp, lb of mussels and a lb of the snow crab with the trifecta spicy level 1. We also got hush puppies, sweet potato fries and a fried cod basket. All of the fried stuff was delicious. The hush puppies were spicy, the inside moist and outside crunchy. Sweet potato fries were crispy. The boiled seafood was okay but not great. The shrimp were overdone and really hard to peel. Out of the 25 or so mussels we got, 7 of them didn't open (30%!!!). Really the only thing that was really good out of the seafood we got was the crab.   Overall this was better than Red Lobster, but it wasn't great and I have no real desire to go back.",

It takes me a long time to crack crab open, but I cracked it all before eating any of it. It was worth the work. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.  My 2nd time here I did a pound of snow crab with trifecta and a pound of shrimp with the Pacific Rim (coconut curry). AMAZING. I WILL be back!",

    "text": "This place always has delicious food, the pulled pork sandwich is always a favorite of the hubby and mine. We always default to getting the shrimp because it's the biggest bang for your buck with some potatoes in corn. There is something about dipping your cornbread in that delicious spicy and greasy sauce from the boil bags. Trifecta medium is awesome, hubby always gets the 5 or 6 which if you love hot food go for it. However if you're like me and get upset because you're just burning all over probably good to stay away..  I really must say the service is almost always lacking, I think 1 of the 5 times we have gone to angry crab and all different locations, they didn't make several mistakes. But hey they are nice and usually they comp what they mess up on. I must say it is a bit exhausting, not sure if it is because the servers get overloaded with tables or that's just their style.   Biggest con of this place, they want to be loud and fun I get it where people can write on the walls and shout and have a good time. But what the heck is up with the damn alarm for birthdays angry crab? You trying to make babies cry and blow out ear drums? Seriously can't stand that dan alarm on top of the noise, but we put up with it for good Cajun grub.... I guess for now.  PRO TIP: please get sausage it's almost my favorite part of the meal and I almost never like pork but man those guys are sooo yummy.",

When I asked, wondered, and ultimately complained, I was told \"Don't worry, you won't be charged for it and you can take it home and eat it.\" That was their way of fixing the situation?!? So awkward and a horrible way to celebrate a 70th birthday. The check arrived, I was starving, and the only thing from our $100 tab comped was my food that I never got. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Well this was fun !! Our party of eleven had a blast.  I loved the concept- you get your choice of seafood (and be prepared to choose) because there's a lot to choose from. How about shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, salmon, lobster, and if you're feeling crabby there are four crab variations -snow, Dungeness, King, and Blue.  But you aren't done choosing yet, because you have two big ones next.  How about your sauce (bet you didn't see that one coming). Choose among Kajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic, Trifecta (those three combined), Traditional Boil, Pacific Rim (coconut curry), and Sweet 'N Tangy.  Last choice is your spice level on a 0-5 level, with 0 being \"Me No Likey Spice\" and 5 being \"Scorching Scorpion -Order at Your Own Risk\".  I ordered Snow Crab with Pacific Rim spice and a Medium Spice Level 2 (Sizzlin').  I added on 4 sausage pieces for $2 and an ear of corn for a buck.   They toss all of your ingredients in a bag and boil it, then deliver a heaping bag of goodness to your table. By the way, there are no dishes on the table- just use the table long butcher paper for your plates.  I really loved my dinner! The snow crab, corn and sausage slices were delicious, the coconut curry sauce was great, and the 2 spice level was plenty for me.  You do get pretty messy eating this way, so you'll get a lobster bib to look silly in, and there's a big communal sink in the dining room for cleaning up your sloppy self.  Nothing fancy at the Angry Crab -it's a big open dining room and very casual. Lots of TVs showing sports, lots of friendly servers, and a big bar in the middle of the room. If it's your birthday, they blare a really loud siren and yell out Happy Birthday.    If seafood ain't your bag, they sell burgers, and dinner plates, and BBQ choices.  We had a terrific night at the Angry Crab.",

    "text": "The Angry Crab is a cool place to dine with friends and family or have a drink at the bar. The selection of food choices is pretty good. There are a few barbeque choices to choose from as well as the seafood boils. The boils are priced with a la carte items. You can purchase a pound of crab, shrimp, or a few other seafood choices. In order to complete the boil, you'd have to then purchase corn, potatoes and sausage a la carte adding them to your seafood.  I ordered 1 lb of shrimp to go, while I sat at the bar. The bartenders were fun. I had a most delicious peach martini served in a jelly jar. I almost hollered at the presentation, but the drink was really good. The bartender tasted it and was quite pleased with himself. Haha.  I ordered my shrimp in mild garlic sauce, as I don't care much for spicy food. The shrimp tasted bland, however, so I should have opted for a little spice to liven things up. There are several sauce options. I didn't much care for having to dehead and shell the shrimp as the legs and eyes are still attached. I found that unappetizing, so I didn't eat many of them. The sausage, potatoes and corn were all good in the sauce.  The restaurant seats lots of people. There is a huge parking lot, however, its shared with several other businesses, so parking can be tricky.  I'd like to go again and dine in. No shrimp on the next trip.",

    "text": "Ever been to a Louisiana  seafood boil?   The locals get together,  take whatever seafood they got, throw in some veggies, some cajun style sausage with spices and it gets boiled all together in a pot.  The seafood gets  dumped out on the table, you pick out what you want:   Eat, conversate and enjoy some Louisiana Comfort food,   It's a helluva good thing.    We loved the food --- I got the Crawfish and had them turn up the heat on the spice, and the wife got the snow crab legs.    We put on the bibs, got a little messy, had a couple of drinks and enjoyed ourselves.   I got the Crawfish boil:  Cajun style with corn and sausage, heat level 4.    It was plenty hot and delicious.   The wife got the blue crab boil, level 0.    They were both pretty good.  The place is clean and the service was pretty good. I'd come back here again.   If I could make one suggestion to management;   You took the concept this far, why not go all the way?  Eating it out of a bag sorta sucks:  find a way to do it right :)  4 easy stars!",

There's no other place like this around and I hope the location is open forever in the future! Although I would LOVE more locations but I'll take what I can get.   I usually split one Lb of trifecta shrimp with my Bf(it is plenty) and add sausage, corn and potatoes. SOMETIMES we even venture and get the sinful Mac & cheese (its soooo good) but not always. I love that this location has the bbq piece so the food is really kicked up an extra notch.   The beers are always cold and the fast pace loud environment is always fun and upbeat.   Don't come here if you don't like loud places.   Keep up the great work Angry Crab & BBQ!",

I started with the charred oysters, which were off the hook, and jumped into a plate of brisket with baked beans.  It was super tasty and tender and didn't even need any sauce although I managed to put a huge dent in my sauce cup. I think it was the best brisket I have ever had and I have had brisket all over the USA.  Vann, was an excellent server and was very accomodating and friendly.  I felt welcome and will return mostly because of his excellent service to me. Thank you!",

Too hot and I like hot) They forgot to bring one order of crab and took the veggies off the order because I couldn't eat them.

Jeff was out waiter and he was super attentive. Service was fantastic.  Food was amazing.   We all drove to 28th / Indian School from North and Central Phoenix, opted against Pappadeaux as we wanted something a little more casual.  Angry Crab was perfect.   We had the happy hour Shrimp Cocktail (a must have with the atomic horseradish), calamari, pulled pork on Poore Bros potato chips, fried clams, alligator, oysters, crawfish, crab, grilled mahi...and OMG it was all amazing.      Thank YOU JEFF for making the birthday dinner a super special one.   Angry Crab ROCKS!!!",

We order snow crab and after quite a wait, it came to us COLD as if they pulled it from the fridge & put it in a bag. We told the server who agreed it was very cold. He put the food back in a bag & said he would go have them fix it. We waited again a long time after which our bag came back (missing some of the crab) and it was STILL COLD! We told the server who was too busy to be bothered by it. We were told we could have another one, but we had already been at the restaurant for 2 hours and did not feel like it was worth it that point. The shrimp was okay, nothing special.  We then we're charged gratuity for a party of 6, however our sixth person was my 3 year old daughter who did not order anything except a scoop of ice cream. Consequently, the server forgot the ice cream and after the THIRD time of me asking for it, she got it about 15 minutes before we left & by then she was tired, didn't eat it and it melted and went to waste.  I honest would not recommend this place to anyone & will never eat here again. HORRIBLE experience. I can't believe I was forced to tip gratuity on a COLD meal & horrid experience!",

Did a taste test between their frozen $8/lb & live crawfish $13/lb - definitely different as night & day. I've had decent frozen ones multiple times at their competitor's restaurant so I thought that maybe theirs would be the same. WRONG! Don't ever order the frozen ones here. As you're chewing it, it has that really old smell & taste like it was frozen in the 1920s, it's dry & the texture is like you're eating a damp paper mache. You know what I mean? Maybe this chain has a different (read: subpar) supplier of frozen crawfish -- seems the crawfish were already borderline stale before they were frozen, & not while they were still fresh. Unpleasant. Not even the trifecta sauce could mask the \"unfreshness\" & salvage the taste.   The live crawfish however are wow! Very tasty, delicious & tastes like how fresh crawfish should! Cooked just right so the meat retains its juiciness & decent crunch to it. And they are ginormous - like baby lobsters! (I wonder if they fed these crawfish cat... Just kidding!) Big fresh crawfish makes sucking those heads very enjoyable. Mmm. These were so huge I had a couple of heads that won't fit in my mouth! Ha!   Ordered my crawfish with the trifecta sauce, which I'm not sure if I really like it. It is their answer to their competitor's signature sauce -- which I really love (of course I am quite partial to garlic). But I couldn't quite figure out the taste profile of this sauce - none of the Cajun, lemon, pepper and garlic flavors stood out nor held the flavors in a tastegasmic way, & together it doesn't seem like they work quite well... Maybe it needs more lemon & garlic?",

Really like the flavor of the dipping sauce and my boy said that he like the flavor of the breading and the meat and that they were not overcooked on the inside.   We really liked the Snow Crab  in trifecta sauce with level 3 heat with a side of #4. They yelled something to my suprise when they set the #4 down, so I picked it up and took a drink.. I guess it was a tradition they do there when someone orders the #4 or #5. It wasn't too hot for me, but then again I like it HOT!! We had corn, sausage and potatoes added to the bag. The corn was great, but  we would pass on ordering the sausage and potatoes as they didn't absorb all the flavor as the corn did. Order the potatoe salad instead. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese. To me it was really good for \"Mac and Cheese\". It had a little spice to it. Maybe from some jalapenos? they add.   We also ordered the triple meat platter with ribs, brisket and chicken and Jr. ordered the pulled pork sandwich. RUDY'S has them beat on the smoked meat, but we will be back for the steam bags of seafood. We would also recommend the charred oysters.   From the looks of their old menu, they got rid of the Angry Orchard!!! Why? I was planning on ordering the \"Angry Balls\" from the old menu. I've tried other cider beers and they are just not my thing. Decided to stick to water today.  Great place to eat. We will be back!!!",

I ordered a shrimp basket and side of corn. The waitress had a nasty unprofessional attitude and brought the ear of corn out first. I asked her could she please bring it with my meal and she replied \"well, I can leave it here, or take it with me.\" Not wanting to get completely ignorant I told her to indeed take it with her. I was nibbling from everyone else order- WAY OVER COOKED SHRIMP and the \"basket might as well have been a \"Happy Meal.\" I see people are raving about this place but our first choice was Hot N Juicy but we decided to give this place a try. THERE IS NOTHING AUTHENTICALLY CAJUN about this place. Back to Hot N Juicy I go. They treat you well there, the seafood is excellent, not over cooked and the wait staff AWESOME. See ya! (PS: if a \"NO  STAR\" option was available here, thats what they would have received!)",

    "text": "Loved it! So happy to finally have a place like this in Arizona thats close by. We are Southern California natives and are spoiled with places like Kickin' Crab and Boiling Crab out there. Glad to say this place met our expectations!  Got the pound of shrimp with corn and potatoes in trifecta sauce, dozen oysters, and cajun fries. The shrimp was great and a level 2 trifecta was definitely spicy considering we both grew up eating spicy food! The potatoes and corn were big portions to our surprise, we could have ordered less. The cajun fries were just alright, but we ordered two baskets of it to cool down our tongues from the spicy shrimp. And last but not least, the oysters were fresh and huge! Hubby loves oysters so if he approves then so do I. Seriously though, these oysters were so meaty we were a little worried they were on steroids or something haha. One complaint is that they don't do half pounds or offer combos with mixed seafood unless you get it by the pound. Good customer service, and no wait at 3:30pm on a Friday. Food comes out fast too!  So recap: 1 lb. shrimp, 4 potatoes, 3 corn (half pieces), 2 baskets of fries, a dozen oysters. Came to $41 excluding tip. Great deal. No left overs but a huge food coma after.   Needless to say, we will return! We tried the surf, maybe we'll try some of the turf next time!",

    "text": "Compared to the Angry Crab Shack in Mesa, this location has ample seating, and also offers bbq! What a great combination. We ventured in and were promptly seated. After poring through the menu, we decided on a combination of 1 lb. trifecta hot shrimp and 1 lb. of pulled pork with hot bbq sauce. The shrimp were just as good as the Mesa location, with quite a bit of heat to them at the \"hot\" level (Level 3 of 5 heat levels I believe). The pulled pork had a nice smoked flavor and the bbq sauce complimented it well. Although the shrimp and the pork were both ordered at the same spiciness level, the shrimp did taste spicier, and I ended up eating so much spicy food that my palate turned numb!  Service was prompt and the waitress was superb in quickly refilling our drinks, a very important service to provide when your mouth feel like its on fire from the spiciness of the food!  After you've made a total mess of yourself from eating tasty seafood and bbq, there is a very convenient washing \"trough\" where you can wash up and towel off after your meal.   The bathroom is where I had to dock a few points. It was pretty dirty, and there were suspicious yellow stains lining the upper part of the stall walls. Hmm.... I got in and out of there as soon as possible!  Overall though, this is definitely a spot I'll be coming back to!",

I'm not a seafood aficionado by any means, but I love a good time, and this place always delivers.   Some seafoodies might say that it's lacking in freshness and quality, at which point I might direct them to a map and a calendar. If it's out of season and delivered to a desert, it might not be at its very best, but that doesn't mean it's not some kind of wonderful.  Furthermore, if you're like me and like little more than shrimp, they've got a plethora of other options. Sweet potato fries, spicy sausage, and edamame just to name a few.   It's great for groups and great for fun, but *word to the wise* if you've gotta paper cut, you better not come.",

The blue crab was over cooked, it was the consistency of mashed potatoes. Our only other experience with them was when we first tried them in Maryland so we figured maybe they just cooked them differently here or they were out of season.  My wife let the manager, Derek, know and he was SO SO kind. He took them off of our check and was so good humored about the whole thing. The food is always great, and everything else was, so we'd highly recommend the place despite our slightly subpar experience tonight, but especially because they took such good care of us! Derek was great, so was the rest of the staff, and of course the food is wonderful!",

Sure enough same great service and food with optional BBQ (brisket sandwich looked yummy but could use some toast on the bread).  The clam strips were a bit too spicy but the waiter got us a fresh, plain order and they were much better. I enjoyed another bag o shrimp, trifecta (lemon pepper + garlic + cajun seasonings all in one) and some big juicy blue crabs with an angry orchard to wash it all down. I especially love the app \"the list\" because although we were told it'd be a 40 min wait for a table we were able to leave, and get back just in time for our booth. Jolly good show!",

I usually order a Poboy or get a boil with just sausage veggies and potatoes. If you are uncertain as to which spices you should add in your boil just get the trifecta it's amazing! Make sure when you order the level of spiciness you consider trying a 1 first. I'm a big spicy food fan but the level 2 is pretty spicy.   If you are in the area and like pulling heads off of shrimps and cracking crab legs, I defiantly recommend you give this place a try.   Shout out to the waiters for always being so kind and attentive!",

    "text": "I'm a Floridian, so I'm a seafood lover at heart. The Angry Crab was somewhat of a let-down for this particular menu item.  I had the fried shrimp basket with a side of sausage and fries, and Trifecta sauce for dipping. The Trifecta sauce is a mixture of Cajun, lemon-pepper, and garlic sauce.   The best thing on the plate was the fries, which were well seasoned, and plentiful. The Trifecta sauce had a really good flavor as well, I could see how it would be a nice accompaniment to snow crab legs, I'll have to try that next time - I will be back, just not for this horrid shrimp basket.  The shrimp was an utter disappointment. I expected a joint like this to serve real, whole shrimp, dusted in Cajun spices, with an authentic flavor. Instead I got breaded, butterflied shrimp with zero flavor, it really tasted like they used the frozen Gordon's brand of shrimp from the freezer food section of the grocery store.  The sausage was plain, and just okay... I don't know how a restaurant can claim to be Cajun or Creola and not serve authentic andouille sausage, but somehow the Angry Crab thinks this is okay.  Needless to say, I was disappointed by my meal this time around, I have been here years ago and tasted the fried soft-shell crab sandwich, and it was actually pretty good. However, this shrimp basket of theirs is a dud though, don't do it.  Also, Baby Kay's is a better representation of Cajun/Creole style food here in the metro Phoenix area.",

My only gripe (okay two gripes)  1. You can't get half orders. You can only order by the pound and sometimes I want variety so that's kind of a bummer. If you have a husband, make him order the other option you want. Problem solved.   2. Dam it I can't remember my second issue so I guess it really wasn't that bad.

However my ratings is not at a 4 or 5 because I feel that the shrimp is always usually slightly over cooked. I usually choose The trifecta seasoning and it  is pretty tasty but it taste mainly like the Cajun rather than a mix three flavors.  If you're not one for spicy food I recommend opting for the first two levels because it can get really spicy. The portions for the sides can be extremely inconsistent. Some days I'd have a good size of the side I ordered and other days there is barely anything.  Service is pretty good. Waiters are consistent constantly checking on you and refilling water. Overall this place is pretty good for its price.",

Ever again. 6 HURTS your tongue, your nose, your stomach lining.  I nearly puked as I desperately searched for some Tums. Props to the Angry Crab for creating a spice that is True to its name, the Grim Reaper. You have been warned.  FYI despite the pain and suffering, I did manage to finish over 2 lbs. of crawfish. Buttttt I am NEVER doing this ever again. I'll stick with levels 3-5 from here on out...  Update: 9 antacid tablets later and I still hate myself and am full of regret.

My family and I go here at least once a month and food and service is good, but today it all went down the drain. We got seated around 7:10 pm and from the start the waiter started forgetting stuff. We are a family of 4 and ordered our drinks...everyone got their drinks except my husband who ordered water, I had to ask a second time for the water when placing our water. Parts of our order started to show up staggered and still no water. I asked for a 3rd time and finally the water arrived. My son's corn dogs arrived, but not his fries. Then our seafood started coming in intervals of 10 min and mine came by probably 15-20 minutes after everyone had their stuff. Still no fries, no rice, no refills, no limes  and I asked again and we were told it was the kitchens fault. 35 min later we got our rice and my son's fries...by them my shrimp were cold and I ended not up not eating much of it. I asked to speak to manager and I did complain about the super unorganized service, staggered arrival of food and how we are there to eat as a family and not stages and how we had to wait and ask multiple times for food that didn't arrive. The manager did offer a dessert or 20% off our tab, either case that doesn't help with the bad experience we had. I enjoy angry crab, please just work on your service and making sure orders are taken correctly and arrive in decent time so we can all eat together.",

    "text": "Angry Crab Shack is place with no shortage of quirks.  Aside from offering a fairly unique menu of southern seafood and barbecue, the restaurant itself is something of a carnival ride gone off the rails.  Built to mimic the feel of a gloriously unsophisticated shack, Angry Crab knows how to stand out in a neighborhood that conforms to a different look and feel.  Their hot sauces range from a mild jalapeno to the Carolina Reaper (the second hottest pepper on the planet, no joke).  And they even have a siren up at the bar that blasts with a deafening volume for birthdays and for those brave enough to tackle the Reaper.  And you're not only allowed but encouraged to draw on the walls.  Yeah, Angry Crab is different.  And I'll happily embrace different if the food knocks my socks off.  Arriving here on a Monday around dinner time, I ventured into the shack for the first time.  Located on the northeast corner of 28th Street & Indian School, Angry Crab's Phoenix location is easily visible from the street thanks to the giant balloon crab statue guarding the front entrance.  The restaurant can seat well over 100 at fully capacity and at times feels like a sports bar thanks to the copious number of televisions on the walls.  The bar was full when I arrived so I grabbed one of the booths on the side.  The menu here gives you a lot of options for meal customization.  The main part of the menu involves the seafood market, in which you choose your seafood, choose your sauces, choose your spice level, and they bring the mixture out to your table in a clear plastic bag.  Though I love crab, lobster, clams, and all the other seafood offered via the market, I wasn't feeling up to the laborious task of breaking and digging for the good stuff.  Thankfully, there's other options including their meat market full of barbecue items, their seafood baskets, as well as their Po'Boy sandwiches.  For starters, I decided to take a chance on their signature in house drink.  The Oyster Shooter.  Local AZ vodka (didn't catch which brand), lime, cajun seasoning, and a raw oyster at the bottom.  For my meal, I was feeling like a Po'Boy.  As this is Angry \"Crab\" I went with the soft shell crab Po'Boy.  Also grabbed some hush puppies and sweet potato fries.  For dessert, I asked the waitress to give me a recommendation between their bourbon pecan and red velvet cheesecake slices.  She chose the cheesecake so that was that.  Total cost for all the food plus tax and tip came to $40.  First the Oyster Shooter.  Honestly, it wasn't my thing.  This was more of a double shot moreso than a full drink.  The vodka and oyster were both fine, but honestly I think the cajun seasoning was a little bit of overkill here.  I'm okay with spicing up a drink a little bit but there was so much that it kind of killed the enjoyment of the alcohol for me.  Let's move onto the Po'Boy.  I got my soft shell crab sandwich dressed with creole mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayo.  I was pretty happy with this sandwich as the fried crab was well cooked and the mixture of veggies and mustard gave it just enough brine and spice.  The hush puppies on the other hand, were a bit of a disappointment.  These had a little bit too much of a liquid texture instead of the soft but bread-like texture I prefer.  The sweet potato fries were good, nothing special, but fine.  As soon as my dinner was done, out came the cheesecake slice (on a foam plate?).  Unfortunately this too fell a little bit flat.  The cake honestly tasted like it had been made days earlier and had a tough texture.  Most unfortunate was that the red velvet flavoring was barely perceptible.  All things considered, a pretty disappointing outing my first go around here.  The Po'Boy and fast friendly service from my waitress was just enough to get their Yelp score to a 3 for me, but only barely.  Next time perhaps I'll stick to their trademark seafood and meat market menus and take my chances there.  I very much want owner Ron Lou's locally owned operation to succeed, but first impressions were very much in the \"meh\" category for me.  Quirky can be a good thing, but make sure the food is equal to the task.",

Now if you're one of those people who don't mind a very laid back environment while eating you mind this place at all. BUT I've came here with some family who aren't such fans and didn't quite enjoy this place like I do. They weren't a fan of the waitresses sitting at your table with you while they take your order, the obnoxious screaming/announcement when someone orders something with the hottest spice level, or the overall noise level of this place. Noise level is probably similar to that of a sports bar. HOWEVER If you're only looking for a great food place and don't mind the laid back environment like me then this place is awesome! Great seafood AND bbq selection and the food comes out fairly quick. Only reason I docked a star is because every time I've came around dinner time, they get busy to the point where they forget to check up on you and I've waited a while every time for beer or water refills.   4/14 UPDATE: I've been here countless times, still love it because I love their shrimp, BUT today was the 3rd time that my boyfriend wanted a 3 meat platter and had to choose something else because they ran out of 2 of the 4 meat choices. Unfortunately we didn't find this out until after we ordered. I understand that it's THAT good and we came at 8 o'clock but if you're supposed to be open until 11, there may be some other people who come in late wanting your yummy BBQ. Just saying ",

It is an odd combination to see BBQ and Cajun food at the same restaurant, but heck, the review was great, so we gotta try.  We ordered a lb of shrimp and clam.  The spicy level at this restaurant is pretty strong.  We had medium and it has some kick already.  The shrimp is nice and big, but may not be completely fresh.  The clam has a little bit of sand inside.  The frog leg was a nice surprised, but the frog leg was huge and a bit chewy.  the meat has a bit waxy taste.  Perhaps frog taste is just not for me.  Beside the Cajun food, I ordered the Pit Plate which contains brisket, rib and pulled pork.  I had the mustard sauce and it was tasty.  Meat fall off the bones and are very tender.  I strongly recommend this over the cajun food.",

I love their sauce, and I think it's my favorite part of their food. I cannot handle spicy so I only ordered their mild trifecta. I'll m1. Snow crab legs: they were good, but due to the nature of the crab, the sauce are completely on the shell and the meat is lacking of the flavor. I have to dip the meat in the sauce. Also, the sauce were not a lot, so I ended up having them to add some more sauce for me. my suggestion would be maybe crack the shell a little bit so they sauce can get into the meat. 2. Dungeness crab: They are huge, I got one that was 1.8 lbs. I think it is decent. However, it was very fishy without sauce, almost like it's bad(It's not bad, the crab meat was still very tasty). I understand sea crabs can be more fishy than lake/river crabs, but I think it was also because the sauce was not absorbed into the crab.  3.Hardrock crab legs: Honestly, that might be my favorite. The crab meat were firm and they were not fishy. The meat even carried a little bit sweetness. I loved it. 4. Char'd oyster. They were really good. The garlic/butter sauce with it was on point and they were tasty. 5. Shrimp: Shrimp tasted good, and the sauce was actually get into the shell, so it was tasty. Their staff was very nice too. However, on my second visit, the computer messed up my bill so I was charged $10 extra. I figured out right away and corrected it. If people were going there, make sure their computer calculated your bill correctly.",

Turns out, we shouldn't have been. I can ignore the one-time disappointing service--the server may have been having a bad day. I can't ignore the fishy smell and rubbery seafood. Clearly my oysters and crab weren't fresh. And, the crab was overcooked. We may go back someday, but I'll remain guarded until they live up to their East Side counterpart.",

    "text": "I think I would've given this place three stars if it were not literally across the street from my home. My threshold for four star review is whether or not I will return.  Came here with my wife to test it out since we were waiting for quite some time for it to open. After some confusion about the opening date and a review removed by yelp for commenting on my negative initial experience with the angry crap (yelp stating that they're open my going there and being disappointed in a night without barbecue), I was able to give the anchor crab a real chance.  My wife and I shared the barbecue meat platter. Which was incredibly tasty albeit for the small portions. It came with two sides, but you can only choose from two of the three picnic sides- coleslaw baked beans and potato salad. The more scrumptious sides were unavailable. Again the portions were very small and despite it being almost $20, both of us left hungry. We also ordered a side of french fries (3$). This was a great size portion and the fries were actually really good too.  I ordered a drink as well. It was a spiked lemonade with ice tea (an upgraded Arnold Palmer). It costed $10 and was served in a tiny little mason jar. I can't tell if it had no alcohol in it or if it was loaded with sugar but it didn't taste like it were a virgin.  A couple things the place can improve upon would also include the menu. It was really confusing had to be explained because it's a bunch of arrows pointing in different directions. Now that I've been there once, it won't be a problem. But when you combine it with the loud acoustics I had an angry crab of a headache.",

We got the shrimp and snow crab with the trifecta seasoning in medium heat. Came out with the wrong spice level (mild). So they brought us out a side of the correct one (and charged us for it). The shrimp and snowcrab did not taste sweet at all. Flavorless. It's like the boiled it in water first and then just threw it in the bag with the (wrong) seasoning. The fried cod was crisp on the outside but the fish was dry and the inside of the batter tasted gooey/mushy. The calamari strips and fried oysters were pretty tasty. The kids loved the Cajun fries. The waiter was friendly. Won't be coming back to this one. A disappointing visit for sure.",

    "text": "I'm giving the angry crab shack three stars due to the lack of customer service. The food was great!  Our waitress was nice, but very forgetful. It took over 15 minutes to get water. Other people in our party of 5 ordered other beverages and those also took a very long time to receive. When they wanted refills, it took another 15 minutes! We had to remind her to get our drinks. She forgot one of them and it took a while to get it. I only received one refill of water during the 2 hours I was there.It wasn't packed and it appeared as though there was plenty of staff. I don't know the dynamics of the restaurant, but waters and refills of beverages are pretty easy. The table behind us ended up leaving due to the long wait for beverages.  On too the food! For appetizers we had the frog legs, raw oysters, and calamari. I didn't trying the frog legs, but I was told they were bland. Everything else was delicious!  For our main course we had dungeonous crab, lobster, clams, king crab legs and two orders of hush puppies. Everything tasted delicious! It was very messy, but worth the mess. I would highly recommend the number 1 sauce with the clams. Dipping the hush puppies in the sauce was amazing!! I would like to go back to the customer service portion of this review. When we received our meal we weren't given bibs or tools to use. These are a MUST. So we had to wait to track down our waitress. At this point she could probably tell we were very irritated with her. I understand she didn't bring the food out, but there needed to be some type of communication or she should have given them to us prior to our food coming. We spent over two hours there when really it should have been one.   Overall the food was very good. Bring a water flask and clothes you don't mind getting messy in.",

After searching the menu and Yelp reviews I found something I could eat. I'm vegetarian although I eat fish and I'm gluten intolerant. We went at lunch time and the place wasn't crowded. I ordered the grilled mahi mahi with white rice. I declined the sides that came with (potato salad, cole slaw or baked beans). My husband ordered the fried catfish with seasoned fries and cole slaw. He enjoyed the fish, he said it was seasoned well. While waiting for my meal to arrive our server Greg informs me that the rice cooker is broken and I can select another side dish. Not long after my husband's meal arrives and I'm assured by Greg that mine is right behind his. More time goes by and Greg tells me that someone burned my mahi mahi, but another piece is being prepared. For the inconvenience my portion of the meal was comped. Greg also threw in complimentary corn bread.   The atomsphere while fun for some was a bit much for me. Aside from the grilled mahi mahi and salmon there isn't much on the menu for a health conscious eater such as myself. That being said, I will not return. I would like to give a shoot out to Greg!!",

For the main entrees we ordered the seasoned and corn-meal breaded catfish basket with fries and coleslaw.  The fish was nice and hot, lightly coated in corn-meal and had a fresh and moist texture while still feeling light and airy.  Couldn't have been done better. The chipotle mayo sauce on the side complemented nicely.  Fries were well seasoned and also hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crisp outside to fluffy inside. Coleslaw was simply dressed and extremely fresh; tasted like it was make within the hour.  My partner ordered the soft-shelled crab baguette with fries and coleslaw.  He found the crab, seasoning and layers of lettuce, pickles and mayo very tasty but found the bread to be untoasted and cold.  We talked to the waiter and instead of transferring the crab to a toasted baguette, the replaced the entire sandwich and it was exceptional.  Our server was prompt, very helpful when ordering, checked on us often, and had a really warm and pleasant personality which really added to our dining experience.  My only negative is that the interior feels a little dark and cold and not nearly as welcoming as the food and service.  However, go for the latter as you won't be disappointed.",

Hopefully I'll be hungry enough next time to get a whole crab or lobster, but for about $25 per person, including a custom coctail and a local beer you won't find a better place to hand over your well earned greenbacks. Will be going back at least once every week or so.",

It's then brought out boiled/steamed in a plastic bag...Had the Cajun seasoning and was VERY HOT! I like hot but this was a bit much. Overwhelming hot. Really good bloody Mary's. Atmosphere was a big NO for my liking as far as a business traveler. Probably best for families with kids and gatherings. Worth a try!",

The venue is rustic, its intended that way, you will get your hands messy, and you will enjoy it! Have been to two locations and this one is my fav. You sit at a table with a paper cloth and markers, feel free to practice your art or graffiti, whatever. Basically you select your seafood protein, select the sauce for it to be steamed in, then select the heat level.(medium is hot). Add veggies bread hushpuppies etc. Enjoy a cold Fresh Squeezed IPA and suddenly your waiter appears with a \"Boil in Bag\" full of crustacean, or fish  goodness. You eat with your hands here but they pre open the mussels( which are amazing) shrimp are large and tasty. Great bread and the hushpuppies have a bit of pepper in them for a South Western kick.  TIP: If you don't want to get messy ask for gloves when they bring your bib!!  Relax and enjoy, it is a wonderful place!",

We were told mussels were out and yet, a bag of it was brought to our table after they said they didn't have it w/o the corn, potatoes, and sausage we asked for. The shrimp was soooo good. They were huge and juicy. Mostly the only thing salvaging this review. We got the Trifecta level 3, mild. The rest of the food was alright. Not great. My gumbo tasted like Progresso brand beef and vegetable soup. My dad and boyfriend's dishes came with the tiniest sliver of cornbread and for how much their meat dishes were, the portion wasn't great. The calamari was delectible. Other than that, I will never come on a Monday again. They were out of everything.",

They brought out cheap plastic forks when I asked, as opposed to the tiny forks made for eating crab and lobster.

I brought my stepfather as my +1, and have a feeling that got me more brownie points than I ever could have hoped for! I've been to the Mesa location several times, but was looking forward to the BBQ. Stepdad was having a new experience from the start. We shared an order of hush puppies, a bag of shrimp (with corn, potato, and sausage) and 1/4 lb samples of the brisket and pulled pork with sides of traditional BBQ and Creole mustard sauces. We also were served Hurricanes to drink. (Or could have opted for a couple of Grand Canyon brews.) It was all terrific! Since Stepdad had never experienced Angry Crab, I got to see it through his eyes as a new place. He was floored! The hushpuppies are more dense than any I've seen before, but the flavor is just incredible. The shrimp was delicious (maybe boiled about 30 seconds too long - but this was a soft opening - I was expecting hiccups.) The brisket and pulled pork were both tender, moist and incredibly flavorful even without the sauce. We both enjoyed both sauces. The traditional was solid, and the Creole mustard was a tangy change of pace.  Yes - we got messy and went through a stack of napkins - but there are handwash stations in the dining room - and mess is half the fun of a crab shack. I'm really looking forward to the official opening, and already have a UYE planned for next Saturday - I can't wait to see the full menu! I'm not alone - Stepdad is coming to join me there for Sunday Night Football next week - and is already planning what he'll be ordering! It's more than a little dangerous this place is so close to home. I had joked with the owner over the summer that I will have my mail forwarded there and my paycheck direct deposited into his account. Now I'm not so sure it was a joke, after all...",

The place is spacious and bright, thanks to the big windows in front of the restaurant. It was noisy in a fun way with a very lively vibe, thanks in part to the enthusiasm of the staff who seemed to me to really enjoy their work here. I ordered a pound of shrimp with trifecta sauce, heat level 2 (the levels go up to 5, but the highest 2 levels are strictly for the very brave), with corn on the cob, sausage, and red potato. What a dynamite combination: big, sweet shrimp, some of the best I've ever had. The other items were perfect complements, all bathed in that glorious trifecta sauce. Upon Arana's suggestion, I ordered Abita Pecan Harvest to wash it all down ... excellent recommendation.  I'm so glad this place opened in Arcadia. I love Angry Crab in Mesa, but now I don't have to drive as far to enjoy a great seafood experience.",

We dined here on their 2nd night open to the public and couldn't even tell!! We are both in the industry (food and beverage) and were very impressed with how smoothly things seemed to be running. The food came out fast and hot. Our server, Emily, was so sweet, kind and knowledgeable. She gave us a nice tour of the menu even though she knew we had dined at the other location. The teamwork was great. We were greeted immediately by another gentleman in an awesome kilt simply because he wanted to make sure we were not waiting too long. Through out the meal other staff members as well as Emily were very attentive.   There are lots of TVS for sports lovers and a relaxed vibe which is what you want from this kind of place.  Writing on the walls is so fun and suggested!   We ordered the crab, shrimp, corn and sausage and a side of Cajun fries. I highly recommend the trifecta flavor blend and if you can handle it add the spice in there. We got the 3rd level and it was perfect (again a perfect recommendation from Emily based on what we told her we like in spice)   If they keep going like this it will be the next casual hot restaurant in Arcadia! Happy to have them in our neighborhood",

    "text": "We have been huge fans of ACS in Mesa since it opened (see my review). We have been driving all the way across town to eat there every few weeks.   Needless to say, we were absolutely psyched to have one open a few minutes from our house.   It looks like they retained a lot of what made the first restaurant so successful. The atmosphere is casual and the writing on the walls and paper table cloths makes it perfect for kids.   In addition, there is a huge patio which will be great in the nice weather, a way bigger bar and beer selection and, importantly, BBQ!  Like the other location, service was impeccable and genuinely cheerful. It seems like people are actually happy working there.   We had the snow crab legs- per usual with trifecta. It was perfect. We then tried the brisket. Flavors were great. I prefer my brisket a little more tender, but given it was the very first day, I'm sure they will nail it. We also had some sausage that was really good.  We met up with old friends and just had a great meal and a great time.   We will be back often.",

Their menu was simple enough. My advice for the uninitiated in this type of establishment is to start the least spicy the step up on subsequent visits. It's better to be able to be able to eat your food than completely waste it because it was burning your tongue to ashes. We also had tasted their Gator nuggets, it was our first time to ever devour a reptile, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The oysters were good as well. But our personal highlight was the soft-shelled crab. It was fried perfectly and was delicious. Highly recommended.",

Definitely get the ribs with the mustard sauce; they worked perfectly together. The pulled pork was quite moist and a sizable portion - my meat loving friends will be so satisfied. My heart lies with seafood and am pleased to have so many high quality options at affordable costs. The snow crab was delectable with the Trifecta. The shrimps were massively plump and when combined with the Pacific Rim sauce...this yellow curry was too good and I cannot wait to try it out with the crab. And my favorite, mussels with the lemon pepper sauce. Tender and full of flavor. The best aspect though is how happy and attentive the staff are. It is obvious they love to be working in such a quality and fun environment.   I will be a regular here most definitely!",

We walked in around 10 tonight and Miranda didn't flinch and didn't rush us. She totally put my mind at ease with the menu and helped me make the perfect choices.  The food. I LOVE crab legs and these suckers did not disappoint. I was soooo incredibly happy with my meal I had to immediately write a yelp review.   The only downside was they were out of brisket for the night and my boyfriend had wanted to order that. But honestly it was our fault we were coming in really late and it's totally understandable that it was all gone for the day. We will try it for sure next time.  And yes there will be a next time and hopefully several million times after that. I will be telling everyone I know to eat here... And I know a lot of people so plan on always seeing a wait at this place. It's going to be the our new favorite spot to take friends in Biltmore.",

I gave up and did try a hurricane.. Wish I had not! No flavor what so ever. We had the  barbecue and the shrimp boil. The barbecue was ok the cole slaw and beans not so great but the pulled pork and brisket were good. The shrimp were cooked perfectly!  We might try one more time to see how the beer situation goes. We do like our beer and everyone has bad day so that's a maybe.",

I would say it is perfect for a first date as if you date does not like to eat with their hands while wearing a plastic bib, well then, best you know that right up front.    While we did not try the BBQ, the seafood was outstanding. I will probably not go with the fried seafood next time but if that is your thing, then go for it.  The real star here is the fresh seafood.  We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab.  It was perfectly cooked and served quickly.   Thank you to our server Matthew for his outstanding service.",

He gave us great recommendations and was pleasant with a restaurant full of patrons. I really loved adding the vegetable bag. I ordered 2 bags with the Trifecta seasoning 1 Shrimp and 1 Snow Crab. We also, ordered a kids basket that's not on the menu but is available. The Cajun Fries are so yummy! Great Draft Beer selection! I don't drink but Grandma ordered a Blue Moon w/ Orange Slice She was content. Management came by to check on service and food and we shared the goodness that Brandon brought to us. Can't wait to be back with family!! Brandon thank you for holding up the Angry Crab promise You are doing a great job and the food you serve is awesome!!

    "text": "First of all, I really wish I could rate this place higher; our neighborhood really could use some good bbq and seafood. Here's our experience: My wife & I were quickly seated, and our waitress quickly got to our table and explained how things work at the Angry Crab. At this point we're thinking we are in for a good meal. Drinks were served right away and we looked forward to the arrival of the food. This is where things went downhill.   My meal arrived first. I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.  After I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good.   She ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!).   I brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.  The drinks were great and Rachel provided great service. I really want this place to work, so I am going to give it another try. I will order the crab and shrimp boil next time I go in. I hope it is good. I can tell they are trying, so the place has a chance since the owners and staff seem to be putting out effort. Sometimes all it takes is a little honest feedback and positive response for a restaurant to really make a splash.",

Have them add some sausage to your boil.  It makes it even better.  Service is very good.  But get there early.  Even though it's a big place, it does full up.  (",

Not going to lie, I like my spicy but level 3 was hot and like they said, there were times I could not feel my lips...but it still did not stop me for finishing my pound of snow crab legs . Nothing could stop me, I ate those legs up.   I usually go by myself but I can see the perks to going with a group. Umm, more things to add to your bag and try.   The service is pretty decent so not much complaints from me. I don't ask for much, serve me my crab legs, give me my drink. Let me eat in peace  and refill my drinks when I'm low.   All in all, if you love seafood, it's a must try. Load your bag up with all the extra goodies to really appreciate the sauce. My favorites are the red potatoes, corn and sausage.",

    "text": "The Obituary of Angry Crab, Indian School...  What was once one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona and I craved regularly has officially DIED. I am extremely disappointed that what was once lively, a fun place to visit with its energetic, wonderful staff, great food and atmosphere has now killed itself off.  It is with great regret to write such a poor review, yet this is my last time visiting this particular location. The service was non existent from the initial walk in and it felt dead and gloomy. We awaited on a greeting that took its time to come while it was not busy. We were seated and again waited an extended period of time to be greeted and what once was a normal friendly greeting appeared forced and the employees are not happy and seems as though this is a place of \"it's just a job\" and not what I enjoy doing...  Overall the wait time was ridiculous. We chose this place 2 hours prior to getting to a concert and although they were NOT busy whatsoever, we waited extensively especially to be served beverages and our meals.  One of us ordered the 2 meat BBQ special, it arrived and the pulled pork meatless with nothing but fat and the brisket DRY beyond belief and the meat was very dark as if it may have been in a dry lamp warmer for hours on end, no pull or juices from the meat and beyond well done.  Prior to my commitment of my favorite \"live\" crawfish, I always inquire of the size and if it's big, I'll commit. No puny mudbugs for me. I was assured they were big and the server indicated, \"as a matter of fact myself and the staff were just talking about how they are a good size finally\". So, that seemed like a reassured winner to me...I'll take it! However, when they FINALLY arrived to the table, they were just about non existent in size, I could not believe how small these things were as if they ought to throw em' back in to the swamp! This was shown to our server who he too expressed disappointment since on the ticket order he specifically requested large crawfish. I didn't bother eating them and was immediately removed from my order. I was then asked if I'd like to reorder or to order something else. I was reluctant since it took over a half hour to get this disappointing order.   I declined on a reorder of the crawfish and instead ordered the ala carte fried catfish, although it was tasty-it was saturated in oil, which made it difficult to eat. I also ordered the favored trifecta sauce with light butter for my shrimp. Again, another disappointment, I am certain at this point the ingredients that were once used when A.C. opened at this location has since then changed along with newer ownership and has now gone corporate. The butter, is not butter and the sauce is of nuclear orange and the flavors not at all the famous trifecta sauce.   The portion size, quality of the food, customer service and atmosphere is POOR.  I truly hope that my favorite location at 75th and Cactus hasn't changed like this, however I have noticed some things that have disappointed there as well.   Please REDEEM YOURSELF Angry Crab. You had some LOYALTY customers here. Return of the original owners and employees! Make it fun, desirable and yummy again! Otherwise, PEACE OUT.",

The shrimp in the poboy was fried, and overall pretty delicious and the slaw cooled my mouth from the trifecta sauce. The bread was a bit hard though..  The fried clams were ok. Large pieces but seemed overly fried.  I liked the convenience of the auto sink, soap, and paper towel dispenser near the kitchen.   Staff was friendly. Food came out fast.

A spacious place where you can sit at the table, booth, or the bar. They have TVs around the restaurant. Service is fast and friendly. The waiters/waitresses will spend the time to go over the menu if this is your first time, and make recommendations on their favorites.   My boyfriend and I usually order seafood here. Between the two of us, we ordered 1 pound of crawfish, shrimps, and clams with medium spicing. I would recommend asking if they have frozen or fresh crawfish. Sometimes the crawfish are frozen depending on the season. Luckily, they had fresh crawfish today! We usually get the trifecta sauce, which includes kajun, lemon pepper, & garlic.  The cajun fries are just right - crunchy on the outside & inside. If you're not into seafood, they also have a meat selection of pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken.   Plastic bibs are provided. I usually tie my hair up in preparation to dig in. Plenty of napkins at the table. A bucket to dispose trash. There's also a sink outside the restroom to wash our hands.     I've been to similar places like this in CA, such as Boiling Crab & Kickin Crab. Angry Crab gets 3 stars for decent seafood in AZ - nice location and good service.",

    "text": "Oh. My. Goodness!    I was invited to this place on a first date.  I didn't know what to expect.  When my date began to explain the menu to me, my first thought was, this is going to be messy.     The meat options that interested me were, snow crab, shrimp, fish and king crab.   My date and waitress recommended that I try the trifecta sauce since I was a first timer.  I went with the snow crab (in trifecta sauce) since it was much less expensive than the king crab.  King crab was $30 a lbs!!!  I had the option of adding red potatoes and corn on the cob to the snow crab which I did.  When our food came out, I was surprised that our respective food orders were in tightly sealed plastic bags.  When I opened my bag, the delicious aroma flowed out. Wow!  I opened my bag by foldeding over the sides of the bag.  I looked around the table for my silverware wondering how I was going to eat this delicious smelling food using table etiquette Emily Post would be proud of.  As I was thinking my date said, \"Just put your hand in the bag.\"  Relieved, I put my hand in and grabbed a red potatoe, bit in and unknownly let out a mmmmm. Yes, it was perfect. I then moved on to the corn on the cob.  Equally delicious.   As I was reaching for my snow crab, wondering how I would crack the shell with couth, my date said, \"You have trifecta sauce all over your face.\" Embarrassing!!! He sensed my embarassment and said, \"It's okay. You're really cute making all those noises when you eat.\" Hahaa.  At that point I figured I was safe to really dig in to this crab.  As I dug in, cracking the shell of my crab, sauce and shell pieces flew all over us.  We laughed and enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere of this location.  It was messy despite using the plastic green bibs provided to us.  The food was amazing and filling.  Being an old school gentleman, my date paid for our meal and drinks so I cannot comment on the total pricing of our dinner.  I can say, I will definitely be visiting Angry Crab again!    For those of you wondering, yes, there is a second date scheduled!  Score!!",

And we go here because the food is fantastic, but we will no longer be going to this location due to a lack of customer service. Though some employees do their exceptionally well, others do not carry out the same energy. Rude, short and sometimes unhelpful is not what we're accustomed to. What set it off mostly was that in July 1st, we tried calling the store a number of times, 5-7 to be more exact, and we have only one answer. This one and only time they answered the phone, no one even said anything, they just simply hung up. This caused us to drive to a location, all the way out in Mesa. Which is a huge inconvenience since we live in the Scottsdale area.  I would not recommend my family to go to that location, but to go to another with more friendly service and one that would actually like to answer the phone.",

    "text": "FIRST TIME HERE! Once my husband, my 4 year old daughter and I walked into the doors. There was 5 people standing there just staring at us for a good 4 minutes and I said \"uhm this is our first time here, we don't know what to do. Do we seat ourselves or.?\" And one of the many hostess who could've at least said welcome or hello or something took us to our table and said \"your server will be right with you\". Same thing I told the server \"it's our first time, do you offer a sampler? I would hate to buy a full meal of something I don't like, we usually eat at Joe's Crab Shack but we thought we try the angry crab shack\". He said \"no, but I promise we are way better them Joe's Crab Shack\". So I told him \"okay, give us a moment to look over your menu but I'll have a dr.pepper, water with lemon\". We were told \"they don't have lemon\". So that was the first disappointment. So we ordered the snow crab , corn, and red potatoes. For my daughter WHICH I TOLD OUR SERVER \"I'll get the mussels for my daughter , she loves mussels, nothing spicy, just plain\" so we waited for our order as soon as it came I tried the mussels only because it was in a red seasonings. It was a bit to spicy. SECOND disappointment. So I refused to give it to my daughter. Snow crab legs , corn, red potatoes were all a bit to spicy for myself. So when my server checked on us I asked \"could I order the chicken tenders with fries for my daughter the mussels are to spicy also could I get some butter for my crab legs\". He said \"okay, we do charge 1.50 for butter\". I said \"that's fine\". So we were waiting waiting waiting waiting. I decided to take apart my crab legs while I wait for my butter. But my husband said he liked the food. He got to eat his crab legs nice and hot. My server came back and asked if everything is okay. I asked \"could I get my butter\". So he left came back and grabbed my butter. By that time my crab legs were cold. So that was the THIRD disappointment. Then my daughter started saying \"mom , I'm so hungry\". So we waited waited waited until we just decided to leave. FOURTH disappointment my daughter didn't get to eat any food. FIFTH disappointment my server never offered me a re-fill when I paid $3.00 for a drink. So overall I say JOES CRAB SHACK IS THE BEST for my family and I. We love crab legs, shrimp and mussels. We love our free butter nice and hot with our crab legs. Joe's Crab Shack always refills our drink. Joe's Crab Shack takes care of my family and I. I've never had one single disappointment with Joe's Crab Shack. So I will never return or recommend.",

    "text": "I use to really like this location but we have had two really bad experiences.  The first time we went in during the week no one was at the front so we waited and the guy at the bar seated us. We sat there for about 20 minutes waiting. As we sat we talked so I didn't really notice exactly how much time has passed until I looked at my phone. I tried to get someone's attention but it seemed like they were avoiding us. Even the other customers notice and made eye contact with me trying to look at their server. Eventually we just walked out, I was too upset to even think to ask for a manager.   The second time I was with my parents and yes, I went in a few times after the first incident giving them another try. My issue was with the service or their lack of. We sat down and no one came for a while then the lady who seated us got us our drinks. Eventually our waitress came and took our order, then that was the last we saw of her until the end telling us she was leaving. We would have to ask other worker for drinks, gloves and bibs taking them away from their customers. I get that they are busy and/or short staffed but I have been to this location so many times and it has been getting worse each visit. Yes, the other workers did help and bring us what we asked for but it still took them a while and one guy just left us the pitcher of water so we didn't have to ask anymore. I was just upset on how everything happened.   We live about 30-45 minutes from there, the closest location to us is on Litchfield so this place was worth the drive to us. But I have been disappointed too many times by this location, and we have been there more than you can count on your fingers and toes. So, it is sad that we will not be returning to this location, hopefully time will past and they will have better service.",

    "text": "Tried to come here once and there was an hour and a half wait.  So we came back a couple weeks later at 10:00pm and was nice not to wait.  Sat at a booth with butcher paper on it. Was suprised by all the televisions all throughout the restaurant and the garage door.  We ordered the Deep Fried Catfish Basket with Cajun Fries, Salmon Basket over Rice and a pound of shrimp with corn on the cob and Sausage Links.  The Catfish was very good along with the Cajun Fries. The sauce that came with the Catfish was very good but the Catfish was good with or without it.  The Salmon was grilled very nice and placed on top a bed of plain white rice. The thing that stood out was how the salmon stayed nice and warm throughout the entire time we ate it.   Both fish meals were tasty and prepared well. No frills served in a basket but so good and inexpensive.  As for the shrimp they were large size shrimp or prawns mixed in a plastic bag with the sausage and corn on the cob in the trifecta sauce.  Enjoyed the meal very much. The sauce had good flavor without being to spicy.  And you can not beat the prices - Salmon $12, Catfish  $9 and Shrimp  $12/lb.  Can't wait to come back and try the BBQ along with other seafood dishes",

But yes, it's so worth it.  I tried to snap a couple pictures but when everyone's too busy wolfing down the food and your hands, maybe forearms, are covered in trifecta sauce, things get a little difficult.  For the three of us, we got: 2lbs of shrimp, 1lb of mussels, 1lb of clams, 1lb of blue crab, and vegetables, all in trifecta sauce at a hot (level 3).  I loved the sauce - it definitely had a good kick to it but I might give level 5 a shot next time cause I mean who doesn't love a little challenge?  The veggies were okay, but next time I'll probably give it a skip and stick to the corn and potatoes instead.  Similarly for the mussels and clams, I mean there was a lot of shell.  I know, I didn't think this through, but probably half the bag was shell and I would've much rathered more meat.  Shrimp was a solid first choice for me, with crab coming in at a close second.  If you couldn't tell, I've got my next visit all planned out.  The boyfriend's mom doesn't care for seafood in general so she ordered 1/2lb of pulled pork.  We had a bite of some of her leftovers after devouring the seafood and it was pretty decent but I'm still a huge fan of seafood so...  To top it off, the boyfriend's dad was still raving about this place a week later, so I think we have a winner here.",

King crab legs had prob the best taste and consistency.  The shrimp were mush - obviously frozen and then overcooked.  Veggies were good.  Oysters were a bit hacked on the half shell and def had a Rocky Point flavor vs Pacific or East Coast brininess.  Took forever to order but waitress was friendly.  Bartender surly but good pour.  Great heat in the #4 spice but get it in the side unless you like it hottttt.",

    "text": "My kind of food here - seafood steamed/boiled in spicy seasonings with an option for barbecue. This is one of those places where the bigger the group of people the better the value. You order by the pound, you share, and everyone gets messy together.  I brought a friend from back East and we both grew up on seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. We were looking forward to blue crabs but they were out. From the remaining seafood choices - and we decided to stick with seafood instead of barbecue - we chose shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs. Trifecta sauce, mild heat because our server, Dion, said that things run on the spicy side.  So, it's entirely possible that ordering Alaskan King crab legs at the angry crabshack and barbecue is a bit of a reach. I didn't care because I have to try them, right?  I wasn't disappointed in them, however, roasted and then split and served with drawn butter is just the best way to eat Alaskan King crab legs and now I know. Everything was delicious just the same and cooked just right. Nothin worse than rubbery overcooked skrimps and there was none of that here.   I couldn't pass up the sausage four-piece and I'm glad that I tried it because it is excellent. For me it was the most memorable part of the entire meal and I will be going back soon for more. I've got to try the barbecue as well. Whoever runs the smoker seems to know what they're doing with wood and low heat.",

I got the Dungeness crab with the trifecta sauce (mild) and he got the king crab legs with trifecta (medium). We also got some of the oysters and Cajun fries. I am stuffed...  It's a very casual atmosphere and located in a strip mall with Sprouts. The service was great and while our server did not talk much, we ended up meeting another server (I believe his name was Matt) who was super friendly and is an Eagles fan. My boyfriend is from Philly and a die hard fan. The next time we are here, we are probably going to ask to sit in his section. As we left, he yelled out E-A-G-L-E-S! And of course my boyfriend followed with EAGLES!   Anyway, try out this place! Be prepared to get some very messy hands, plastic silverware and some really good seafood boil!",

My co-worker who had also ordered a side of mac n cheese was told they ran out but she could substitute. So she got the corn bread which they charged her extra for!  Then she gets to the car and there is no cornbread,  that they just charged her for,  and she had to go back in again. And the mac n cheese that we had such an ordeal with was the nastiest mac n cheese I've ever had.

Unfortunately our server Amber was no where to be found. We ordered a pound of crab and a pound of crawfish with a few appetizers and sides. Our crab and crawfish came out within 10 minutes of ordering which was great. Our server asked us if we would like butter, lemon or limes to go with and we said yes. About 20 minutes go by and not even any acknowledgement from our server as we tried to catch her many times. She was tending to the table behind us and all the tables around us. She finally came by 30 minutes later and asked how the food was. We let her know we never received our butter or any of our other dishes and asked if they would be on the way. She clearly forgot to put in the other food. By then our crab was already gone and our drinks had been empty and we told her to just forget the butter. We received our other dishes within 5 minutes and the gumbo and cornbread were incredible. About another 20 minutes go by and our server has not even come by to check on us at all. The hostess actually came by to let us know she would be bringing our check and not even seconds later a buser brought us our check and picked it up. I was just absolutely shocked that our server didn't even come by or make an effort to increase the service she was providing us. It was really upsetting to see every table around us be catered to and we sat there unnoticed for an hour...... The only reason I would go back here is for the food.",

I don't remember our servers name but he was really cool. they warn you that they're hot is REALLY hot but it wasn't at all...BUT  I love spicy food and it didn't phase me. Everything was ok but extremely greasy for steamed seafood. I had all the seasonings mixed together, hot.. I forget what they called it. I've tried a few other restaurants w the same concept and they're the only ones I found the food to be really greasy. I'm talking like if the sauce  (juice) gets cold it turns into like a chunky gel. that's probably the only reason we wouldn't return. other people seemed to really like it, ill stick to the other places I'm use to. try it for yourself its worth the try if you don't mind al lil grease in your steamed seafood.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place out because of all the great reviews but I have to say it was not what i was expecting at all. I have to point out that I spent a big chunk of my life living in the Mediterranean so I really love simple, off the grill, seafood or mixed with pasta and risotto, typical croatian and italian style meals. So if you are more into that then this is not the place for you. All the seafood was prepared in really heavy sauces that varied in spice and were pretty heavy on the garlic. Normally, I use garlic when cooking all the time but I dont like leaving a restaurant with my clothes smelling like im going off to chase vampires. The mussels were mixed in with really strong-flavored sausages, which kind of takes away from the beauty of eating seafood. The raw oysters were really \"meat-y\", it felt like I could almost choke on it and i sort of had to chew it pretty hard to be able to swallow it; all in all a very different experience.   This is definitely a \"get down and dirty\" kind of place; they even give you gloves! Don't expect utensils or anything metal or glass for that matter, even the cups are plastic. Overall the environment is okay (if you disregard the screaming servers every 10 minutes or so). I give them three stars because, overall, the seafood seemed pretty good on rare occasions when I was able to taste it from all the sauce.",

    "text": "On a date night with my girlfriend, we decided to try this place out as we'd heard great things about it and after giving them a call and hearing that there wasn't a wait yet, we hustled down there.  We were seated right away and didn't think much of getting seated less than ten feet from the kitchen.  This should have been a tip off that the night would be headed downhill.  We told the server (Jared) that it was our first time and he welcomed and explained the menu (not too difficult to understand).  We asked for a few minutes and after about 5 minutes, we were ready and 5 minutes after that he passed by and said that he would be right back.  He then proceeded to assist and serve the table behind us for another 10 minutes or so.  When we did get to order my girlfriend ordered the Blue Crab and he informed her that they were out of it.  Now, they either were out of it when we showed up and he didn't tell us or... they ran out in the 20 minutes it took us to get our order taken.  Strike one.  We both ordered a pound of shrimp with the trifecta sauce and a few potatoes and a piece of corn (they list the corn as corn on the cob but its more like half a cob).  We also ordered a piece of corn bread (pretty small but we were at least told this before ordering) and an order of mac and cheese.  The portion of the sides were pretty lack luster given the cost. Strike two.  They brought out my order and we waited for her order to come... and we waited... and waited.  It was between 15 to 20 minutes until they brought it out! During that time when we inquired about it we were told, \"It comes out when its done\", \"they're backed up\", and when the order finally did get there, the girl apologized because \"it was put in wrong\".  Awesome.  Strike three (wish we had gotten out of there).  We only saw our server once more before he brought the check and we were lucky enough to snag a refill.  All in all this was not an experience we will be taking part in again.  The food was decent, lot of work and a bit of a mess, but we did know that going in.    We wished we had a different server (like the one that offered to top off the beverage when we asked for a top to go) like one that seemed to care that we were paying customers.  We really wanted to like this place but not with this service.",

My wife and I visited with our 2 kids, and were promptly seated. I was feeling adventuresome so I ordered a pound of craw-fish and my wife ordered a pound of shrimp.  We got them cooked in the trifecta sauce with a heat level of 2.   The waitress asked if I knew how to eat craw-fish, and if I didn't she could show me. It had been a long time since I have eaten craw-fish, so I asked her for a demonstration. It turns out she really didn't know how, but it cost me 3 of my craw-fish before she pretty much gave up. The sauce was bland, and easily forgotten.   But perhaps the worst thing of the night came when the waitress asked if I wanted a refill, she picked the cup up from the top with her hand in the cup. Clearly this is not how your supposed to pick up a cup. Needless to say, this did not make me happy.  Maybe at the end of the day, this place just isn't for me, but from my perspective at least this visit warranted the low score.",

The bartenders were friendly and sociable.  I'd happily come back here to catch a game on their TV screens.   Once the fam arrived we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was informative and had good recommendations. Our group ordered a combination of shrimp, crawfish, king crab legs and oysters, all soaked in their recommend sauce (I think it was called the Trifecta?). Everything, especially the oysters and crawfish, was delicious. Expect to get messy, as you will be using your hands a lot. Luckily, they have a sink along one of the walls where you can wash your hands.   Didn't get a chance to try their crab, but will have to go back earlier in the week cuz apparently they tend to sell out by Sunday (which is probably a good sign!). Everything else was great. Would go back again.",

This means you are not stuck with little alcohol wipes to clean your hands.   On Mondays, they have 'surprise bags.' It changes every Monday and for $20 it's a pretty good deal. The first time I tried it the bag contained catfish. I had some apprehension at first but it went away fairly quickly.   If you love seafood and do not mind getting your hands dirty, this is the place to go. Also, don't forget to get their cajun fries. Delicious!",

Everything is dusted with a cajun seasoning that is really good and has the right amount of spice. The first time I was there I ordered the crawfish with trifecta seasoning and it was really good, basically peel your own crawfish in a garlicky spicy sauce. It is served in a plastic bag and the bag had a chemically odor, probably from the heat of the crawfish which was kind of off putting to me. Another time we ordered the catfish, which was awesome! I can't say a single thing bad about the food although the service seems disorganized. There area a couple of wait staff that are super helpful. Then others that will avoid making eye contact so not to help you... yeah talking to you lady with the butterflies in your hair!  The food makes the meh service tolerable.",

Bar has a decent selection of beers to go along with the full bar menu.  Typical open stile floor plan.  Not a place for a quiet romantic dinner...   The bad: The menu is confusing and disjointed at best.  Not to mention poorly done.  The spicing of the sauces is irregular and the staff says that the heat levels are off.  Best plan would be to order no spice and have the sauces on the side.  I like spicy food, but the \"mild\" completely over powered the smoke flavor.    Easily this place could be a 4 or a 5, or drop down to a two when and if they can work those kinks out.",

I brought my fiance here for his birthday back in October, and had my heart set on coming back this past Friday for mine as well!!! :) I totally love this place! The best cooked Crab Legs, Lobster, gator nuggets and Fried Oysters!!!! Love the LVL 4 seasonings!! Even the level 5, was amazing!! You guys have the best service, and are very friendly!!!  I am happy and proud to say that I have now found my \"Go to\" Place for Seafood!  This place puts all places to shame!! It is safe to say that Joes Crab Shack has lost a long time customer!! The cooks in charge, are to die for!!!! Way to go guys!  The Quantity and Quality are properly priced. My kids were over satisfied with their chicken tender baskets and were brave enough to try the appetizers & they loved it! They are requesting to come back for Christmas dinner!! So I hope you guys are going to be up for service!!! Red Velvet Cake was delicious! Overall money well spent!  Next time, I'll try the coctails. ;)   *In my Profession, I come across a lot of people, and will always STRONGLY recommend THE ANGRY CRAB SHACK!!!!* We'll be seeing you again Very Soon! :)",

I would recommend the shrimp which are huge and super tasty. We also tried the BBQ side of things, which is pretty good, but I prefer the seafood. They also have a pretty good beer list and and TVs to watch sports. The only downside is that it's super messy and a lot of work so you tend to be focused on workin for your food instead of talking to your friends. But if you are up for it, it's great!

There was a decent lunch crowd and really cool, diverse mix of people. friendly host and servers. we had calamari strips. very tasty, I believe they used panko breading which was different. for entree, we both got the soft-shell crab basket. I really like soft-shell crab so finding this place on Yelp was great because now I now whenever I am craving where to go. Easily one of best fried soft-shell crab I have had. Their batter and seasoning were amaze-balls. You get two nice size fried soft-shell crabs in basket full of cajun fries and a side ... there were 3 options, I think cole slaw, bbq beans or potato salad. I had bbq beans. I mean for me it was all about the crab anyway. The fries were really good too. It was like $40 before tip for 2 soft drinks, appetizer and the 2 orders of soft-shell crab basket. I think that's not bad. We definitely are going to get back and try dinner because they had great list of seafood that I want to try that basically requires peeling, cracking, etc at the table. If you are craving seafood in the desert, you've found your place. Oh, and they have BBQ too!",

Based on the recommendation from the waiter I opted for the shrimp with the trifecta sauce and mild heat.  It didn't disappoint.   My wife had Dungeness crab and my son opted for the ribs w/Mac N Cheese.  The crab and shrimp were boiled to perfection.  The ribs had an excellent smokey flavor and the Mac n Cheese was a special recipe on an old favorite.  With the exception of my son we opted for water and got a bill for $79.  Not bad for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert.  This is CASUAL dining experience.  Expect to have a splattering of sauce, best case.  The wash basin nearby came in handy for clean-up.  Received excellent service from all staff.  Angry Crab Shack is not some place I would go on a regular basis but it is nice change of pace.",

    "text": "This is one of our favorite go to restaurants for really good seafood. We absolutely love this place. For a Friday night at 8:00, our wait was only 15 minutes. Not bad at all. For the first time, the menu is a little confusing but once the server explained it, it was on. We started with the charred oysters. They were cooked nicely,  great texture & full of flavor. We will definitely have them again. For the entree, we ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of mussels, a pound of snow crab legs with corn, potatoes and sausage. I didn't like that the corn, sausage & potatoes cost extra but you must do it. The sauce we chose was the trifecta medium. Before you judge, the medium is no joke. Medium my ass! It starts out mild, but because you eat so much, the burn quickly intensifies. The food was cooked to perfection and was more than enough for the two of us. It was so much, we had left overs for the next day. I rinsed off the sausage, cut it up smaller & scrambled it in eggs for breakfast. For drinks, appetizers & entrees, we got out of there for around $77 including tip. Not too bad.  I recommend the angry crab for just you & your mate but its really good for large gatherings. Its a fun atmosphere, with awesome seafood food & plenty of laughs. We're going again tomorrow night!",

I've given it a number of chances, chalking it up to a bad day. But three times in a row the food had been disappointing and the service has been awful. Last visit our order came out wrong. Another server fixed it. Not tools were given for the crabs/shrimp. Another server got them for us. Needed a box. Went and got it myself. Tried to get the check. Asked a different server. Then the hostess. Finally someone brought it over and cashed us out. Never saw the server. Get it together.",

    "text": "I am from New Orleans, so when I asked the waiter if the boiled shrimp and crawfish were boiled True N'awlins style, he said Absolutely.  Bottom line either he lied or was misinformed. In N'awlins we add all of our seasonings into the water BEFORE adding the seafood... That way the shrimp/crawfish can absorb the seasonings as they are going through the boiling process... The end result is spicy flavor all the way through.  This is NOT what they served me.  What they did was boil the shrimp and crawfish in regular water (without seasons added)... After removing the seafood from the unseasoned water they placed it in a bag, added their mix of seasonings to the bag, and basically shook it up... The end result is that the SHELL of the shrimp or crawfish had alot of seasoning on it... But WHO EATS THE SHELLS???  The meat inside was still flavorless (unless I happened to have a little seasoning stuck on my fingers from peeling off the shells).  This place is call the ANGRY CRAB, but all it did was make me SAD.  :-(",

I am not a seafood fan, so I had the buffalo chicken po' boy with cajun fries. It had coleslaw and tomatoes in it and it was AMAZING, the fries were spectacular! I also had the kajun bloodymary cocktail, which was delicious! My boyfriend had the king crab, spice level 2 and corn on the cob - i had a taste of his and it was a little spicy, but very good. Everyone else had a little bit of everything; blue crab, shrimp, briscuit (which I had a taste of and it was good!), ribs, etc. Everyone was happy with the food and the experience. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there were a couple of items on the menu that we wanted to try, the mac & cheese and a cocktail, but neither were being served or had been discontinued - take it off of the menu if it's not available. Other than that, the service was great. It was busy as expected, but our reserved table for 10 was ready at exactly 530 like we requested. The fried foods take a little longer, so if it's busy be prepared to wait. Promise it's worth it!",

I called last night and booked the reservation for today, when I called they asked me if anyone had Dietary needs.  I mentioned that one of the kids had seafood allergy and we just wanted to make sure it was still safe for her to eat there without cross contamination.  After 10 minutes of booking the res and the hostess made note of our little niece the manager Jarred called me.  He reconfirmed the reservation and reassured me that our niece would be perfectly fine because his team would be really careful. He even gave me a list of what she would be able to eat.  Upon arrival we were greeted right away and they were finishing up prepping our table.  The Manager Jarred saw us holding the birthday cupcakes and he immediately said hello and asked if he could refrigerate for us.  Diane our server was very attentive.  When she sat us she asked what we were celebrating.  When I told her three birthdays, she took the names of our three individuals.  The food came out promptly and it was delicious.  After Dinner, Diane brought our cupcakes out on a tray with three of them with lit candles.  The staff acknowledged the birthdays through their fun PA system.  Great place for a fun and interactive dinner! Couldn't have asked for a sweeter most attentive and detailed server! Thanks guys!",

As first timers he took the time to explain the menu to us and made sure we felt welcomed.  We ordered the cajun fries and hush puppies.  OMG!!! They were delicious! We ordered beer which came out very cold. He was attentive to our table checking back often but not too often. I ordered the trifecta mussels mild with red potatoes.  There was soooo much flavor in this bag (a good thing). To me the mild was a little on the spicy side, so next time I will have no spice. My husband ordered the trifecta lobster with corn and sausage, hot. He was very pleased with his meal. This is not an intimate restaurant, it is not meant to be an intimate restaurant. You are to come here, have fun and laugh. I really enjoyed the writing on the walls. It is messy on purpose as they give you a bib and there is an industrial sized sink to was your hands. It can be be noisy, but again I was not expecting a quiet, dimly lit establishment.  In my opinion this would be a prefect place to have a celebration!",

The oysters were some of the best we have had in the valley. Very fresh! My only complaint about my meal was that the crab was not cleaned. I guess it is the nature of this type of dining experience, but having to clean the crab at the table is gross and a bit unappetizing. I got over it and enjoyed the meal, but think that this could be an issue for others, especially if one is not familiar with the  crab cleaning process and what to do. Luckily, I have been eating (and cleaning) Dungeness crabs since I was a child so it was kind of a non issue for us but defiantly worth mentioning.  The service was great! Our server, Jacob was awesome. He was attentive, funny, and he took time to explain the menu as it was our first time. Give this man a raise! :) A welcome addition to the neighborhood!!

Our table started off with fresh raw oysters that came in a platter over ice and tasted as if they were scooped out of the ocean. I ordered King Crab with the Trifecta sauce at a spice level 2. Now I like things super spicy hot, and a level 2 spice definitely kick back. My wife had crab in a lemon pepper sauce with a level 0 spice and that was very good too. All the people in our party were pretty silent, just heads down, enjoying the deliciousness of our Cajun boiled seafood. I've been to lots of fine dinning restaurants, but I must say the service was outstanding. Dion kept all the beverages full, replenished napkins, and removed finished items without us even asking. The restaurant was packed too, so extra skills points. If you look around all the staff seemed to enjoy being there and it showed. I SO,,,can't wait to come here again.

Pork ribs were my favorite.  Smoked to perfection and oh so tender.  Fell off the bone and right into my mouth.  Yum.   The dungeness crabs were a good 2+ lb. and enough share.   The king snow crab legs did not disappoint.   Cajun  fries cooked to perfection.     Service was slightly better at the original location but am sure ACS will work it out.   Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "My husband and I went last night for the first time and we were shocked! As a bartender in the neighborhood, I couldn't believe I had never heard of this place! Everything was FAR from perfect, but being in the industry I know things happen.... Candice, our server, and the male manager did what I wish every place did under the circumstances to make us happy! Thanks guys!    We arrived at 7:30 on Sunday and it was PACKED! There wasn't even space to grab a drink at the bar while we waited the 30 we were quoted (they text when your table is ready- how refreshing for us youngsters!) so we walked across the parking lot to another restaurant for a quick drink. We were texted at 7:40, so we rushed back over. I know that would bother a lot of people, but the restaurant cannot help when tables decide to leave, and I was super excited to try this place! We were seated in a booth with a view of the entire dining room- perfect for people watching! Candice said hi and that she'd be with us shortly immediately after we sat. This is huge to me as a bartender- I am constantly amazed at how rarely we get this tiny gesture at bars and restaurants!    Candice was BUSY but she handled it like a champ and gave us the lowdown and answered our questions. I ordered king crab and my husband ordered the bbq combo... this is where things could have taken a turn... Candice came back and informed us they ran out of brisket. No biggie, there's a few other meats to make up for it. A couple minutes later the nice male manager came and told me they ran out of KING CRAB! Oh nooo! This was the only crab joint of it's kind, and it's all I wanted for my birthday (they didn't know this because I avoid embarrassment at all costs)! The manager and our server were professional, apologetic, upbeat and had every intention of making us happy. They did.     I had the snow crab instead, which was perfect and messy and what I wanted all along, I just didn't know it, and the bbq was beyond our expectations. The mac and cheese was delish, so were the sausage, potatoes and fries. We are pretty easy going, but I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed and not want to come back... Nope.    I have never been treated better by a restaurant and we eat out many times a week. We usually get stereotyped as young, tatooed and probably cheap/poor, etc and not treated great. But here, with an eclectic looking staff, we were always a priority and were checked on often and chatted up by staff. What an AWESOME place!   The icing on the red velvet cheesecake was that when we got our bill it had been adjusted properly and a couple things were comped for us. Most places do not do this anymore and that's unfortunate. We will absolutely be back again and again. My new favorite spot!!!",

I ordered a basket of fries after I had already received my shrimp and it took longer than expected to get my fries but Cassie came over and sincerely apologized and said the fries were on the house! Right after this Derek (the GM) came to our table to make sure everything was okay and he also apologized and gave me his card and told me to let him know the next time I was going to eat there. I was amazed at how well I was treated and how great the food was. I'll definitely be coming here more often.",

I had the soft shell crab basket - the crab was delicious, nice coating. The French fries were good as well.  Could have done without the cole slaw though which had absolutely no flavor to the point where I thought maybe we got some before anyone dressed it??  My husband had the crab with the trifecta spice and loved it.  As others have said, the food is spicy -- both my husband and I love spicy and he ordered mild and it was plenty of spice.  The service was attentive and we were never left with empty glasses.  The manager or owner perhaps that evening was very friendly and explained the menu and came back to check to be sure everything was to our liking.  We will definitely go back!",

Cause if you have kids they can draw.  The clams are also delicious. Haven't tried a whole lot from here.   Service is really good when I have been here.   They're usually out of a lot of things.  Every time I have been here they have been out of atleast one menu item.  One time I called right when they were opening and they were literally out of all crawfish and clams. Which is crazy. She had no idea when the next shipment would be in.   So anyways we will probably be back.  But for the price and the chance they will be out of stuff I may as well cook at home.",

We ordered the gumbo- came out lukewarm- server graciously reheated it but it had 2 shrimp and 2 slices of sausage. It was all soup and rice. We love gumbo and this was disappointing. Then we ordered the soft shell crab. It was so over breaded that you could not taste any crab. By far, the worst we have ever had anywhere. We then decided to try the fried shrimp, again, over breaded and not good.   We paid $40 for the lunch with tip and left very dissatisfied. The food was unappetizing and we had stomach aches all afternoon and evening. We will never go back.  We will go back to Hot and Juicy for sure however. It seems as if this management is distracted away from fish with BBQ.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for this place. I really wanted to love it. I am such a fan of seafood, and Cajun food in particular. I went to college in New Orleans, pre-Katrina and my family is also from the Gulf states. Anywho, my first visit to the Angry Crab was interesting and slightly disappointing.   The wait was 45 minutes on a Friday night for a party of 5. Once we were seated the waitress took our drink orders. They ask if you've ever been there so that you know how to order. Basically everything is a la cart and by the pound on the menu. We ordered 1lb each of crawfish, snow crab legs, and 2lbs shrimp. Corn, potatoes, and andouille sausage were all extra also. We ordered the trifecta seasoning, mild, which was the best seasoning option according to the waitress. The food came out in steam bags and was placed on our table for \"low country boil\" shared type eating.   The seafood was fresh and hot, and they bring your 1bs of seafood as it's cooked by the kitchen, not all at once. Each type is in its own bag, not all in the same bag for the flavors to mix and melt into each other, which I would have preferred. Additionally, the seasoning/sauce flavor you choose is put into the bag likely AFTER the seafood is steamed, which means it just sits on top of the shells and never absorbs into the seafood, which takes away from the flavor profile.   I frequent Hot & Juicy, and in comparison I prefer Hot and Juicy. The pricing is about the same, but H&J's flavor profile kills Angry Crab's.   Also, I didn't like that long after we left the seafood smell of the place was stuck to my infant son's car seat, our clothes, even our shoes. That never happens at H &J, which I frequent at least every other week.   I give Angry Crab a 2.5 out of 5, but since there wasn't a half star, I'll give them a 3 for effort. I would return again with a group if it was their choice but not on my own. It was just ok.... but for that price I'd prefer Hot & Juicy.",

The crab really won me over.  Soft, juicy, spiced just right, each bite convinced me we should have ordered more!   We had ordered butter as a dipping sauce but it wasnt necessary.   The fried cod was not spectacular.  It wasnt bad but it was not anything special.  However the fries could happen again!  They were crispy and tasty, and made me feel much better about their fried food.  I will go back again, though I will stick with the crab boil.",

The service was great, our waiter checked up on us a lot, which was great, but I'm sure every time he came, he saw me smash the crab legs that I ordered!  I don't play around at this place.  The service was awesome.  We ordered some hush puppies and cajun fries.  Also 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 lbs of mussels and 1 lb of shrimp!  This time I ordered the trifecta but only level 2 spice!  Once again another solid meal.  I give it 5 stars!  The place is loud, its messy, but its good ole eating.  My type of style.

From the moment we walked in we were greeted by two friendly hostesses, taken to a great table and our server, Alicia, was there immediately! Everyone is ridiculously friendly, helpful and accommodating! And the food is simply off the charts! Try everything!!! We had crab legs, brisket, ribs and catfish! You'd think either the fish or the meat would be superior, but not the case -- everything is AWESOME!! I couldn't even talk (one of my favorite things in the world) as our meal was too intoxicating! You'd be doing yourself and your stomach a disservice if you don't try this joint your first possible opportunity! A good looking staff, great food, exceptional energy and you get to wear a bib as an adult! Enjoy!",

The six of us were seated and soon greeted by Alexia. She took excellent care of us all night. We ordered: 4 pounds of shrimp, two pound of mussels, two pounds of snow crab, a full rack of rib and a pound of catfish. We also got Gator bites and Cajun Fries plus a couple of red potatoes. After two rounds of drinks it came to $220 or about $37 per person plus tip. We had a lot of leftovers.   I had the Gator and Snow Crab. Since I ordered my crab with '#3 hot' sauce, Alexa recommended I get my gator in buffalo sauce. It was better that way. The crab was boiled in a bag (like all other non-BBQ dishes) and the seasoning was added in. Great flavor. The shrimps came unpeeled as well.   Messy but good. It was very loud in the ACS and there were a lot of celebrations going on, so we just shouted thru our meal.   Good, fun place to go but not on date-night: too messy and too loud.",

If I had known that Angry Crab is like that I would have refused to go. But I'm so glad I went!  This place is very unapologetic. They are loud. There is writing all over the walls. They make an embarassig hullabaloo when it's your birthday. But it's all in the carefree fun of the place.  The prices are incredibly fair and the staff always walks you through the entire process. You can choose what kind of seafood you want, what dressing for it to be boiled in, and spice level. Spice level tends to be on the hotter side. I like to think I can tolerate a high level of spice but a #3 was good for me.  Don't get scared to get a bit messy. It happens to the best of us. The bibs and rolls stacks of napkins are there for a reason. They also have a huge sink in the restaurant to wash your hands which I think is a nice touch.  Since going my first time I have gone several more and think about it way more than I care to admit. I'm hooked! But in all fairness I am a HUGE seafood fan so I may (or may not be ) biased.",

The flavor was just right. Only thing we didn't like was, the crab came whole and uncleaned. Caught us off guard, because most places crack and clean it for you. We cracked it open ourselves, cleaned and rinsed the crabs ourselves, came back to table and dipped them back in the yummy bag of sauce. i'm so not a diva, but i was too far away from home to be the ONE to get sick :/...Any who, I guess Destiny noticed, and told her manager Nate (who was awesome, and understanding), he came over and we explained the situation, and he assured us that it was okay to eat, and even laughed with us a bit.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Came to this location for the first time to specifically try the BBQ.  My wife and I typically go to the Mesa location and just order bags of seafood.  As a BBQ snob, had to give it a try.  Started out with an order of the gumbo and I think I've mentioned this before, the gumbo is great here.  Okra thickened, not too much rice, plenty of sausage, and enough seafood to make it worth it.  It has a good kick without adding any additional hot sauce and it is filling - as it should be.    Got a 1/2 lb order of the brisket along with potato salad and the beans.  Barely perceptible smoke ring around the edge of the brisket and not much bark on it - so I was a little dubious.  Tried a bit without the sauce.  It is tender, quite tender.  So that started to save it.  But the brisket on its own without anything with it lacked a little flavor.  It definitely needed a sauce.  the choices were their original BBQ and a mustard-based sauce.  I asked for both on the side.  Both were decent, with the slight edge going to the mustard sauce.  Good mustard kick to it.  As with any good Texas BBQ, came with a slice of plain white bread.  The beans were pretty darn good.  3 or 4 different kinds of beans, bits of meat for flavor, thickened enough in the pot to be not too watery and plenty filling.  I would venture to say that these are some of the best side of beans in the Valley.  The potato salad on the other hand, was not good.  Server told us it was Cajun-spiced potato salad, but I failed to notice any Cajun spice at all, nor any other spice for that matter.  It was totally bland and not worth your time or stomach real estate.  Don't come expecting Texas-style BBQ.  And don't come expecting amazing BBQ.  Based on the brisket alone, this was pretty good BBQ, worth at least a try.  Is there better BBQ in the Valley?  Yes, much more.  Can you get great seafood and gumbo along with it?  Probably not.  The rating here reflects the idea that the sum of the parts here are greater than the whole, saved by sides and seafood.  And since I'm here to rate restaurants, not just dishes,I'm comfortable with this 4-star rating.",

    "text": "I bumped this review up to 5 stars because AC is your best bet for the Southern flavored seafood boils.   Plus,  their menu has tasty options beyond the boils that don't seem like after-thoughts ie - \"Oh yeah,  let's put something else on the menu besides seafood boils\".   Nice because boils can be a little messy.   It is no secret,  I love the little dirt Devils known to most as crawfish,  some know them as crayfish and others crawdads.   For the past 2 years,  I have had the pleasure of going between AC and HnJC for my crawfish.   Crawfish are in season from early in the year until about MID-SUMMER.  They are best,  to me, between April and late June.  The window is small considering the fact that I can eat snow crab all year long.   OK,  with that in mind,  it is mid-June and I have been to both places 3 times each since April.   I have come to the conclusion that Angry Crab is the best and most consistently good establishment in Phoenix for Southern flavored seafood boils.   Every time I have gone over the past 2 years,  I have received a consistently flavorful and fresh batch of crawfish.   I order the Trifecta-hot.   There is always an adequate amount of seasoning and the seasoning has consistently tasted good and the same.  I normally add half an order of sausage and corn to go in my boil.  I Took a visiting family member their this week and she said her crab boil was the best flavored she has had in quite some time.   The nice part about AC is the \"extra\"  stuff on the menu is equally as good.   Po' boy sandwiches,  char-grilled oysters (oooh lala,  delicous)  and the oyster shooter is to die for!   They also have the yummiest seasoned fries.   If you like oysters or if you like escargot, I highly recommend that you order the char-grilled oysters.  They are delicious!  You won't regret it.  Send me a compliment if you read my review and order them!  I'll just reply back, \"I told you so!\"    BTW: They do have BBQ.  If you read through my reviews, I only do BBQ at one establishment in PHoenix.  Their oysters are good on the barbie.  I have no clue about the other meats.  Kid Factor 7/10 My Return Factor: 100%.",

I had family visiting from out of town and we love seafood so we decided to have a large family dinner here. It was a fun experience to get seafood in a bag that you eat from, so no plate. You get to pick your spice level which is great for a variety of palettes. When we went, it was Friday night during dinner time. It was very packed and thank goodness we had a reservation because I heard the hostess telling people 45 minutes to an hour wait.    It should also be noted that it is VERY  loud in this bar/restaurant. Whenever there is a birthday at a table, they ring a cowbell and everyone starts howling. I felt like I was an extra in the movie \"Coyote Ugly\" every time this happened which was probably 10 times during the course of our dinner and every time it startled my four-year-old daughter. Refills and additional items needed with the meal were a rarity being that it was so busy in the restaurant.",

We got the headless shrimp for the twins and they loved it.  It is messy eating. Be ready to use your hands and basically your table acts like the plate.

Food is real good - I had a small (about 1.9lb) lobster and my husband had crawfish (1lb) and 2 plain rices. The sauce is a mixture of garlic, lemon and cajun, I forgot what's the term for it. The lobster has a lot of meat, and you can taste that it's fresh (not frozen). First time I had a craw fish, it is like shrimp in a lobster shell, it was ok, nothing special. 3. So we paid $45 for the lobster, $14 for the crawfish, and $4 for the 2 servings of rice. The lobster is a bit pricey, but it is worth the price. I felt like the whole lobster would have been enough for myself and my husband.  Overall, very good service, kind of reasonable for the price (similar food chains have that price range too anyway).",

Lol  J suggested we come here for dinner on our anniversary the other day. I, after the shock wore off, said YES!! J does not care for seafood. But they have BBQ so everyone's happy!  Unfortunately they were out of brisket, so J just got a burger. We ordered a shrimp cocktail and C and I split it. Seriously the freshest shrimp you can get mainland. We also tried the hush puppies which were pretty good. And also got the 2 piece slider order. We all enjoyed them and the Cajun fries that came with.  I ended up getting a shrimp boil with the works ( vegetables, corn, potato, and sausage ). I was kind of surprised only 1 red potato was in the bag with an order. But now that I reread the menu online, it's priced at .50 a potato.   I got the traditional boil at a level 1 at the suggestion of our server. The traditional boil is already spicy. Lord, he was right. A higher level and I would have been in pain the days following. Lol  I had A LOT of my boil left over. Wanted to take my leftovers to work and was worried about the smell. Our server suggested I reheat them in a bowl of hot water in plastic bag. I did that next day and no one at the office was the wiser I was eating shrimp. You could only smell the awesome boil liquid! Lol  Can't wait to go back and get another boil!!",

I don't mind because I can go sit at the bar and order my favorite beer, purple haze. It is so delicious and has a hint of raspberries to add to the flavor. This time we got to sit in the same spot as the last time, which made the experience even better. I ordered some king crab, a pound of shrimp, a corn and two potatoes, with the trifecta at a medium level. My friend ordered a pound of shrimp with the trifecta and at a medium level , as well as, seasoned fries. I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, but we weren't going to let that get in the way of us devouring all this goodness. It took us an hour and two purple hazes later to get through everything, but well worth it. This place never disappoints.",

    "text": "If you have never experienced the Angry Crab, then you should, at least once! It is quite the experience.   When ordering, there are a few decisions to make if you choose from the seafood market: 1. The type (I chose the Dungeness crab), 2. The sauce (I went for the trifecta--which is Kajun, lemon pepper and garlic), 3. The spicy level (wimpy, level 1 out of 5, which was just right), 4. Decide whether you are adding anything to your bag like corn (I did and am glad I did as the corn in the sauce was delicious), although whatever you add will cost additional money. I had a taste of the sausage from one of my dinner mates, and next time, I'd also add sausage and red potatoes.  The cost of the seafood is all by the pound, and I was told that the Dungeness were 2 or 3 pounders, so I asked for a 2 pounder, which would be retrieved from the tank (I never did see the tank but meant to on the way out). After a few minutes, our waiter was back to tell me that although there had been five crab in the tank, someone else had just ordered all five! I really had my heart on Dungeness crab as it is actually in season right now, although if they are live in a tank, then they are always in season! After some time previewing the menu again, I chose the snow crab.  Everyone's bags were delivered to the table except mine, and after several minutes, I told everyone to start to eat, which resulted in my sampling several bags until mine arrived. The spice level ramps up quickly, so be careful. I'm not a total wimp when it comes to spice but am glad that I chose the wimpy here! When I did receive my bag, the snow crab was good, but more veggies in that yummy sauce would be better.  The fun part of this experience is eating with your hands, wearing the BIB (really, you have to wear it), and washing up in the trough sink.   Leave your jewels in the safe, wear clothes that can be easily washed, and come for the experience.",

    "text": "I was invited out to this place a few weeks ago with my friends who raved about this place. After a super enjoyable evening and bomb seafood, I was convinced that this place would be the seafood contender for AZ, compared to San Diego!! Our server was on point, the food came out as desired and I was so excited about the next time I could visit!!  Until today.. My fiance and I randomly went around 2pm today and there was hardly anyone there!! Got seated quickly by the host, and was asked about drinks and if we knew the run down of the menu. We said yes and the server left. After a few, I was asking about the 'fresh squeezed ipa', she didnt seem to have much knowledge about it and never offered a sample. So I just ordered it anyways. We ordered our food ( Brisket sandwich w fries and #1 of King crab legs with a potato, trifeta #1) and was given water and a set of tools to crack the legs. The server was surprised that I brought my own as the last time, they didnt have enough for the whole restaraunt the last time..(??) So my fiance gets his sandwich like super quick and the runner runs off and its not his order. He tries to stop her and he ends up going to the bar to explain to her that this is the wrong order and why are we getting it before my boil? Next thing that shows up is my crab legs and THEN!! I get my IPA... I respectfully wait for my fiance's food to arrive and its cold... Super fatty (I like fat), coleslaw on the sammich when he asked for it on the side and there's no utensils to eat coleslaw... By this time, I have been trying to get our server's attention for 'melted butter' as I battle my crab legs. By the time I get it, we have not been asked how our food was, if we needed anything or to refill our waters. This was not butter.. it resembled the kind you put on popcorn. My $28.50 crab legs are swimming in oil and they have no taste. I pull off my bib and wait for her to come around.. 10 minutes go by and her 2 tables left, still no inquirey about our food. As she's cleaning the 2 tables around us, I stand up and ask her for a manager. The manager never introduces himself and almost walks by us. We tell him whats wrong, like our food coming out at seperate times, no utnesils to eat coleslaw, potato etc. and he seemed surprised but decides to comp our meal. My fiance and I have worked as servers in various places and realize that not everyone will have the training or knowledge but this was ridiculous!!  Every aspect of this place (during the day) was pretty damb sad for the price and servers who were standing around talking with each other and ignoring their tables!! Also after we talked to the no name manager, the booth next to us had a huge spill and there was no one around even caring about it.   It really sucks because I was so impressed the first time that I didnt mind laying down some serious cash for this place. Lesson learned.. This place needs some serious training if they want repeat customers..",

Whoever runs the kitchen now has no idea what they're doing.. ordered king crab with trifecta 2 sauce, some corn on the cob and potatoes. Took forever for our food to hit the table and when it did the crab was cold. Like.. refrigerator cold. This never happened under previous management. Even our waiter who was actually pretty great could feel how cold the crab was through it's shell. He took it back and when he returned the crab was hot but had no sauce in the bag... so again we had to flag down a server and ask them if we could please get hot crab with the trifecta 2 sauce like we ordered. Food was taken back again and finally returned the way we ordered it.  No compensation what so ever was offered for our patience or our long wait to fill our hungry stomachs due to their double mistake.  Very disappointing visit.",

    "text": "Firstly let's get one thing clear: New Orleans is my jam. I freaking love that city. I love that nothing ever closes. I love that people speak French. I love that you can take drinks TO-GO from restaurants. I love that it is simultaneously home to some of the finest white-glove restaurants in America as well as some of the seediest, most degenerate bars that have ever been built. And most importantly, I LOVE the food.  So when I saw that Angry Crab, a Mesa restaurant that I've been meaning to get my Cajun fix from for months, was opening a new location down the street from my house, I was beyond thrilled.  Angry Crab doesn't necessarily bill itself as a \"New Orleans\" restaurant, but the elements are there. Cajun seafood boils, po-boys, oysters (even char-grilled!), and alligator are all on the menu and when we ventured over, a whopping 4 days after they open (I'm surprised I could even wait that long) I knew exactly what I wanted: A dozen raw oysters and a pound of crawfish.  Unfortunately, after we were greeted by our cheerful waitress, we were informed \"We're out of crawfish and we're out of raw oysters\". Whomp whomp. So I guess they need to work out some kinks in inventory, understandable since they've been open for such a short period of time, but I honestly might not have even gone had I known that in advance.  Instead we split a dozen wings (kinda like oysters right? Except...not at all), I got a pound of snow crab (trifecta sauce, spice level 2) and Lance got the Alligator Basket.  The wings were delicious. Instead of traditional wing sauce we just got the same trifecta sauce they use for the boils and it was fantastic, no ranch or any additional dipping sauce was needed.  My crab legs were also awesome, and a HUGE portion. I wasn't exactly sure how much a \"pound\" would be, considering the shell-meat weight ratio, but it was more than enough for me and would probably be enough for two people to share with a couple apps and sides.  At $15/lb that day for the snow crab (less or more for other items), I thought it was a pretty decent value.  I was too busy working for my food to try any of the Alligator basket but it was devoured so I'm sure it was good too.  All-in-all, I'm looking forward to Angry Crab reversing the curse of that particular location so I can keep getting my NOLA fix without buying a $300 plane ticket (and nursing a 3-day hangover because, come on, it's New Orleans). I'll update when I can go back to get my oysters and crawfish, which I'm sure I'll find a way to do VERY soon (though I'll call ahead this time).",

    "text": "Had the king crab with hot cajun and garlic butter sauce. Amount wasn't as much as I am used to getting, and would have gave this review 4 stars but I am giving it 5 stars because of the GREAT customer service from JEFF! I got the spice level of Hot but it was too hot. I can't believe there were 2 more levels above mine! I love spicy... i love kimchi, siracha, tabasco, all spicy things but I am going to get mild next time! Thanks again Jeff! Your company should thank you as well because you are the reason why I gave it 5 stars!",

    "text": "So we finally checked it out! The place is huge too like the mesa location but there's no patio sits. The front staff were nice and pleasant. Our server was helpful and nice. Our food came out hot and fresh. I ordered trifecta shrimp which is my favorite from the mesa location and it tasted the same! What I like about this location is they serve BBQ! It was my first time to try their brisket and it was soft and tender and delish. But it doesn't go along with the shrimp. So just order it with cajun fries and beer, it's better. If you are feelin the crustaceans, order the shrimps/crabs or the mussells/clams with rice and lots of lemon juice!!!",

I ordered a martini, and got a 1oz shot of room temp vodka, then resorted to walking over to the bar and asking for some ice to chill my \"martini\".  Service was slow and lackluster, and what I ordered (boiled shrimp) they had run out of, so instead they brought me battered (fried) shrimp, which I could not eat because I have celiac disease. Then I waited another 25 minutes for my food while everyone else was finishing up.  Oh, and even with a reservation we still waited 45 minutes for a table on a week night.  The spicy veggie bags were pretty good though.",

    "text": "Ohhhhhhh mah god. This place is that good.   Let me start by saying I was mad at this place.... I tried their food at Scottsdale Spice and thought I was going to die. Their 'hot' sauce turned out to be one of the hottest sauces you can get... it was so hot, I couldn't taste for about 30 minutes... it hurt.... so I was not so thrilled.   Anyway, in hind sight, I decided that they were True to the festival and brought the heat and in the nature of being a good sport, I decided to come out to a UYE here tonight with a small group of Yelpers. I am so glad I did. This food was phenomenal. I had the hush puppies (3$ for about a thousand of them), which had jalapeno inside and were little fried balls of joy. I tried a grilled oyster... never had this before... it was so fantastic. Garlicky and wonderful. There aren't many places where I would actually order oysters, but this is now added to my list. For my meal, I had the fried cod po' boy (7$.... yes you read right... and this thing was big enough for 3 meals) with a side of the 'trifecta' sauce at a level 3 spiciness. This was damn good... spicy, without being too spicy. The fish was flavorful without being fishy. The bread was soft and delicious. The fries it came with were crunchy and spiced perfectly. This place has some serious 5 star potential pending a second visit (which should happen in the near future). Definitely recommend!!!  PS they have Abita beer here, which was good, and the service was fantastic... these guys really took care of us. Thanks guys!",

    "text": "Drove from Chandler to try Angry Crab and BBQ because it just opened recently.  I was the first customer when they opened at 11 am.  I ordered the shrimp , same one I always ordered at their branch in Alma.  I ordered the rice on the side. Rice was hard and not fresh ( at  11 AM?).  I told the waitress who is very friendly,  she took it back and called the manager.  I told them both that: the rice that they served was what looked like their left over from the nite before. I said your chef decided to sprinkle the old rice with water to make it softer and then warmed it up and served it to customers until it is gone.  They did not deny it and apologized. The chef could not find their lid to the rice cooket that morning and was not able to cook rice.  They made me wait 20 minutes so that they can cook fresh rice. I did wait.  If they are serving left over rice from the nite before (rice is cheap ) to customers,  what other left over food in the menu are they serving during the first couple of hours that the restaurant open the following day?    Really , if you ordered anything in the menu that is loaded with SAUCE,  can you  tell if it is fresh once they pour the sauce over?   It makes me believe that they will  try to serve left over  sea food to customers especially the COST of shrimp is way over the cost of rice.   Because of this experience , it just made me think further,  are they also cheating the customers on the WEIGHT of the seafood that they serve? Remember CUSTOMER pays by the weight of crabs, shrimps, crab legs etc.  HmMmm????  Do they charge us by the weight of the sea food before it is cook or after its been cook?  Either way ...... Do they mask their left over food by pouring SAUCE over the dish and no one will know !  Veronica",

We love the loud atmosphere, as do our kids.  Tonight we went for dinner again, our server was Alexa (pretty sure that's her name) she was awesome! She made sure to explain everything to us, and double checked everything was good constantly. She has exceptional customer service skills, she kept making sure my daughters were satisfied with everything. When she took our drink orders she added that if we needed anything like warm water (to warm milk in bottles) or a warm rag to clean them up, just to let her know what we needed to accommodate them. I should add that my daughters were also very fond of her. My kids love eating here! It is such a fun and loud environment, and they sure do love being loud and having fun! Going to dinner is usually such a hassle with two little divas under 3, but this place makes dining with children so easy. And to top it off great prices! So to wrap this up in my opinion the service and food both were 5 stars. We will definately continue coming here for a delicious and fun family dinner!",

My BF and I came in after a quick yelp search of nearby restaurants an once again were not disappointed!  We were surprised to be seated immediately because the parking lot was pretty packed.   Our friendly waitress explained everything and brought out bibs and things to crack crab.  The table is covered in paper which is good cause it's definitely a messy meal!  We ordered the hush puppies as an app and they were tasty.  He ordered the king crab and I ordered the shrimp.  We paid $2 more to have their heads removed.  Well worth it as I don't like my food looking at me before I devour it.  We got a bag of veggies to share. The veggies were good but we weren't too sure about the pumpkin that was in it.  It was a ton of food.  We both ordered the trifecta sauce #1 heat and that was spicy enough for us wimps.  It had a delicious flavor.  I couldn't eat all my shrimp but my BF was able to finish it after he ate his crab.   We had a fun and tasty experience and will definitely be back. My only recommendation for the restaurant would be to give out wet naps at the end for those of us who choose to dig in and not wear gloves!",

I was disappointed to find that about 20% of the crawfish in the bag was missing its tail.  No bueno for crawfish!  That would be like riding a bike that doesn't have tires!  Of the remaining mudbugs, I found them to be dirty in flavor.  You have to purge these things and I just think they missed that step.

Bf and I had a pound of snow crab legs that came in a bag of sauce, I had the trifecta, which the waiter said it was their most popular, and he had the pacific rim. They supplied us with tools to quickly and efficiently get meat out of the shell (we were given scissors as well which helped a ton!) But it still took us a while to really finish it, and not let any go to waste since it was 15 bucks that night. I also wouldn't say this place is autism friendly (I'm on the spectrum and I have really sensitive hearing) because they have a loud blaring siren that goes off annoyingly whenever someone orders a level 4-5 sauce (ghost pepper and scorpion!!) And birthdays.. unfortunately like mine. But the cheesecake I had was delish. I wanted cake but I was only offered a rootbeer float or cheesecake (which I presumed was free but I saw another birthday table get a chocolate cake slice and I think they paid for theirs..) but still that was really good cheesecake. If I got more used to that loud siren I'd go here more often but I'd rather go somewhere that's more quiet for crab like Joe's.",

Having read reviews, I knew this would be plenty spicy (and I like spicy food). My friends that are bigger wusses wished they ordered a 0. The seasoning is very flavorful, unfortunately my plastic bag (how the food is brought out to you) had a leak, so be careful about the red sauce getting on your lap. A plastic bib only covers so much. I was fortunate because these crawfish were alive right before I ordered them and came out looking/tasting great. I also added some sausage to my bag (it's one kielbasa-style sausage cut into 4 pieces) which was also flavorful and made it just the right amount of food for me. Sides ordered included the sweet potato fries-ok; cajun fries-ok; and bread for my friends needing some spicy food killer. We were fortunate to not have a big wait and the food came out relatively quick. My biggest complaint would be that we needed paper towels vs the napkins provided on the table. There are a couple of wash basins to fight for when it is time to get cleaned up. Also, the table clothes are paper. Before we were all done, a bus boy came to roll up/take away half of the stuff still there on the table. Normally when I'm done eating I really don't want to look at the carcasses of what I devoured; however, on this occasion some stuff was cleared that we were not done with. Overall a good experience and I expect to return to try something different.",

    "text": "This place was grrrreat! I had a terrible experience at a different restaurant in the valley that serves similar type food (Hot N Juicy in Glendale) a few days before my visit here so I was really looking to get my 'fix' of crawfish.  Angry Crab did not disappoint!  The wait to be seated was about 45 minutes - which was not bad at all considering it was a Friday night.  They use 'The List' app for waiting so there was no question or confusion about wait time which I loved.  Once seated we had an excellent waiter who was super attentive and knowledgeable on the menu.  I was expecting a long wait for our food because it was so busy...but I was delightfully mistaken and we got our food super fast. Less than a 10 minute wait from when we ordered to when the food started showing up.  We had the frog legs for apps - my first time to try those and the breading on them was delicious! And then my husband and I shared a variety of the steamed seafood critters.  Two lbs of crawfish in the trifecta sauce, 1 lb shrimp in the kajun sauce and 1 lb snow crab in the traditional sauce.  The traditional sauce was our favorite - super flavorful! Overall, we had a great experience and I will gladly return!  We have a similar restaurant (Hot N Juicy) only 15 minutes away from our home but we will gladly pass right by it on our way to Angry Crab instead (which sadly is a 45 minute drive).  It's that much better, period!",

They were great. Full of meat with a buttery garlic sauce. Corn and a potato. My friends had oysters they enjoyed. One had chicken the other Shrimp that were succulent with the trifecta sauce. The wait staff that we encountered were wonderful! The front manager showed us to our table. Her name is Vanessa and she was fabulous. She came back around and spoke to us later. Then Sampson took our order. He was so patient explaining everything, how it worked, very solicitous. Then he had to leave and Christine took over. Also very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. As I said Vanessa came and talked to us. The people working at this location made the already great food extra special. I would highly recommend this restaurant and this location to anyone looking for seafood in the valley. It was a fun place lots of vitality to go with the food!",

I went here for my 26th birthday and unexpectedly had a huge party of 25 guests! The manager and staff were so accommodating even though I did not have a reservation we were seated in 15 minutes. The customer service here is just as excellent as their food! My guests and I had an amazing experience and they helped make my 26th birthday amazing for my family and friends! It was the first time most of them had been there and they were extremely impressed. Travis our waiter was so charismatic, patient and accommodating! Thank you Travis! Also! I arrived with a huge heavy cake and right away the manager offered to put it in a freezer for me! Overall-- the food, the cocktails, the service, and the atmosphere were simply perfect. Thank you!!!

We are a regular at their angry crab Mesa location and expect the same taste with the tri-fecta sauce, but it was disappointing to say the least, there wasn't enough garlic or any butter in the sauce, it tasted like water. It basically tasted like watered sauce steam shrimp. We asked the server how come it taste nothing like the taste we had at their Mesa location, they said maybe the cook kinda messed up the sauce recipe. I understand this location just opened and there are many things to work out but surely their trifecta (most popular) sauce need some serious work at this location.

I was running late so she ordered for us....1lb shrim and 1 lb mussels (they didn't have crawfish :( ..sad day) and she ordered it in trifecta spice..  It was pretty delicious...it was pretty spicy but unlike HotnJuicy on my first time it was less spicy...so more tolerable..Their fries were very good. The rice looked super dry but it ended up pretty soft...  Def ask for salt pepper with lime to dip and break down the buttery spice of the shrimp and mussels...  The atmosphere is very casual, their walls are covered in writing, for a cool vibe...It gets a little bit loud but fun! There was 3 times that a loud bell type thing rang for birthdays (it was really loud). Their dining room is pretty big. Ooh and they have a sink at the back of the restaurant so you don't have to go to the rest room to wash your hand when you are done!  Pricewise..it's pretty close to HotnJuicy.  hmmm idk which one I like better...have to go to both more times :)",

Neener-neener.  Atmosphere is very casual yet completely comfortable, service is always friendly and timely, and the food is consistently good. And look around, you'll see so many people smiling. Now that's success.   And reflecting on that now, I think this is what makes me want to give 5 stars and keep coming back to a restaurant: It is consistently good.

    "text": "Definitely fun ambiance and our server was awesome. That's the three stars. Lost the two stars for the food being ... surprisingly disappointing. Not sure what all the hoopla was about based on the reviews here...well We ordered Fried Calamari, Fried Gator nuggets and Gumbo.  Fried Calamari was undercooked, dipped into sauce and the breading got stuck in the sauce and meat tasted fishy..as in not fully cooked... I'm a sushi lover so I pushed thru it. Gator nuggets were old and probably got frost bite, and well...since it tastes like chicken and the breading was burnt and hard, we all know what that tastes like. Gumbo was very thick, salty and definitely not fresh, assuming pre made frozen bag of soup... no distinct flavor of anything... barely taste the different flavors. The two small pieces of sausage and the 4 pieces of tiny rock shrimp is what somewhat saved the dish with a mild flavor boost. We pre ordered some food to go for a friend. Our waiter was raving about their bbq sauce and ribs...so we took a chance. Well let's just say it's not even worth writing about. Maybe since they are known for doing table broils we might give that a try....one day, maybe.  To each their own and this was mine.",

I had crawfish in the pacific rim sauce, which was a spicy coconut curry butter sauce. A little different but so good!

Our server was not joking when he said everything runs a little on the hot side. I ordered the medium and I can usually handle my spice but this was HOT (but in a good way)   2. The service and ambiance is really fun, it was a little loud for grandma, but definitely a place I'll come back with a group of friends and start crackin at some seafood.   Also our server Jeff was awesome. Very attentive and seemed to be juggling a lot of tables... he even got some chuckles out of my non English speaking grandma... not an easy task my friend.",

There were a number of salads that could be tailored to your needs as well as a a veggie and tofu boil. My husband was excited to order the crawfish boil and I got the tofu and veggies. The menu for the boils is super flexible as you order your protein, sauce, and spice level. They warned us that their spice level is way higher than typical. So when ordering, mild is more like medium and medium like hot. If you order one of the seafood or tofu boils, prepare to get messy! They serve it in a bag full of the items and sauce and you use your hands to eat! Overall, we were happy with our experience and will likely be back!!",

I'm from the south so I will say that I was expecting my crab legs and shrimps to be 'from the south' my friend and I ordered a pound of crab legs and a pound of shrimp with potatoes and sausage. We got the triple seasoning which was good. First let me say that I don't like the idea of not being able to order a half pound of anything. If I want crabs AND shrimps then I'm obligated to purchased a pound each. If the prices are by the pound, why can I not get a half pound of multiple items. Secondly, my shrimp were so overly cooked that they were gummy. I was so confused. And I'm not sure why they would've been overcooked because they weren't very hot when they came out  The crab legs were fine. Overall I can say that I was NOT impressed. Our waiter was fine. He took our order and got our food out to us. I can't say I'd ever go back.",

( raw showed up frozen... which leads me to believe that they shuck then and put them on the platters with ice and they refrigerate them. ) that I didn't appreciate. They made it right and brought out some fresh.  Ordered the breaded scallops and king crab and shrimp and sausage and corn.  Everything very good.  They provide all the tools and gloves and bibs.  I wouldn't get the king crab again.. as it was so hard to open /crack the shells.  Too much work. The shrimp( no heads) were great!! Easy to peel and very tasty.  Did the top 3 spices.  Corn wasn't great..sausage was good.  I'll be back.",

Everything was perfect! They even gave us a delicious anniversary dessert    We prefer ACS over Hot & Juicy (a similar place in town) for a few reasons. It's more open/ spacious, the mixed blend taste better and we don't have to deal with Mill ave and campus traffic.",

She was very thorough with explaining menu options, pricing and kept checking on us (in a very non annoying way) to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying our experience.  The food was great! I ordered the a seafood boil with Trifecta Sauce/mild and a side of Cajun sauce for easy peel shrimp, red potatoes and corn. It was FLAME. So delish. My husband ordered King crab, red potatoes and corn and didn't say a word the entire meal. He was too busy eating :) !   Give it a shot!",

I had the happy hour fried clam/calamari, the gumbo on the soup menu and the full rack of ribs.  The fried clams/calamari were, well, fried.  Nothing in particular stood out.   The gumbo was not bad.   I thought a bit on the starchy side as far as the thickness.   Then, again, I don't have anything to really compare gumbo with.   I mean, I've had it, but it's been a while.  The ribs I took home but had some today.   It comes with two sides, which I had potato salad and cornbread.   The potato salad tasted commercial.   Nothing special about it.   The cornbread, nothing stood out about that either.     I must say the ribs are quite meaty, which I like.   Not that fat and bone BS going on.   The sauce that accompanied it, well, I have better that I had at home; therefore, I just used that.  As mentioned, Ben was our server.   He was very efficient and professional in bringing out the food.   We all had separate checks; therefore, no one got the wrong check or wrong food on the checks, which I've seen happen prior at other places.   What makes it more efficient is the fact he numbered us and wrote it on the paper \"tablecloth\" used.  And the food brought out also had the accompanying numbers of each guest.  I would not go back for the food, but it's not a bad concept.   Maybe a place to bring out-of-town guests?   I have been here prior and had the seafood, veggies, etc. in the bag, which is quite messy.   I wasn't in the mood for seafood last night, but I did taste one of the shrimp of one of my tablemates.   Different levels of hotness of the spice is given.",

While I am far from a Bloody Mary aficionado, this Bloody Mary was excellent. It had the right amount of Cajun spice, and alcohol. It even came with a small appetizer as seen in the picture.  As for the meal I ordered an appetizer of calimari. It was lightly breaded strips with an awesome cocktail sauce that had a good flavor of horse radish.   As for my meal I ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs, beans, potato salad. It came with all that and a slice of lightly toasted bread. I regularly cook ribs on my custom smoker, and I must say these ribs were authentic BBQ. They were not some oven roasted ribs with sauce on them. They had a slight smoke ring that authenticated the cook method. They were served single bone, and what I call dry. I didn't  need the sauce to add flavor. They were very flavorful. If I were to sing them on anything, I would say they were slightly under cooked. They none didn't bite clean and there was little to no pull back in the rib. But none the less, they are worth trying.  They brought the Mrs. one of the best slices of cheese cake I ever had. It looked to be fresh baked with a slight hint of coconut. And I do love coconut!  Give em a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

This was both of our 1st time at Angry Crab and I cannot believe the quality the service and the overall experience. Destiny our server was very kind, informative and helpful. I will be coming back this week. It was so good I asked to repeat my order so I can take it to go for my family to try it. That was money well spent. It's the next day and I want to go back so bad! That Trifecta Sauce ahhhhhh was so damn good they could have given me a bucket of sauce with a straw and I would still write the same review. When you find good food spots like Angry Crab you show appreciation by writing reviews and shouting out the server. Wonderful time with my sister laughing and eating crab and shrimp. Thank you Angry Crab!",

My fiance order the catfish po boy, while I ordered gumbo (which I had to take home because I was so full) and the alaskan cod basket with potato salad. Their food is always delicious. I haven't tried their big ol' buckets before, and I really should give it a try since that's what I see everyone else having when we walk in, so I may post about that when I do.

    "text": "I have been hearing about how amazing this place was for a while now at work and decided to check it out for myself. I am a big fan of crawfish broils, seafood, and bbq. They do have a big variety on their menu, and I am a huge fan of the fact they buy locally, and use their food waste for composting. When I got their I knew I wanted to try their crawfish. Unfortunately they were out. Then I knew I wanted their ribs, but unfortunately once again they were out. So I got a pound of their shrimp with their cajun seasoning, withe the lemon pepper and garlic seasoning as well. I scaled back on the spice or heat level. Then the waiter talked me into getting the snow crab with the same seasoning. Before my meal came out I ordered the gator bites (huge fan of gator). The gator bites were okay, so was the dipping sauce. There was some huge pieces, then there was some really small pieces, nothing really consistent. That caused some of the piece's to cook differently. So some of the pieces cooked really well, while some were dry, gator is really tricky to cook. The cajun seasoning was to my liking. Once my shrimp and crab  came out I was excited, but I had one problem. Something in the seasoning reall brought out that fishy smell. I'm pretty sure it was the garlic. But the smell was really over powering. As much as I love seafood that really overpowering fish smell can kill my appetite. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and it was okay. What really blew my mind was the crab. The crab was amazing, the seasoning went perfect. I will definitely come back, hopefully when they have crawfish, and mix it up. Also the staff was really friendly, and jolly on the spot.",

We left 1# of the shrimp uneaten. The hostess brought some more spice which helped a little with the flavor but I couldn't get past the soft, mushy, pasty shrimp. I did let them know and they mildly apologize and gave me a slight discount-still expensive dinner for two with a couple of beers over $70.00.

    "text": "I'm not sure who decided to combine a southern style seafood restaurant with a BBQ joint but that man deserves some sort of humanitarian award for his efforts in making stomachs and taste buds very excited.  Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night after hearing great reviews from other yelpers. We did have about a 45 minute wait but it was well worth it and kind of fun to track using the app they use.  I got the shrimp with sausage, potatoes, corn and the trifecta sauce medium spicy. My girlfriend got the snow crab with trifecta sauce mild. Everything was fantastic and thank god we got the warning from the waiter that the spices run hot as even the medium gave me a nice little burn without impacting flavor. The flavors were fantastic and there is just something fun about getting all that juicy goodness by peeling your food by hand and dunking in the sauce. My only gripe was that my shrimp were over cooked just enough to get a bit mealy.   The corn was fantastic and just absorbed all the butter it was cooked in and the trifecta sauce making for a ton of flavor that hits your taste buds in a rush. The potatoes were good as well and what you expect. The   Now you're probably asking yourself about the BBQ I mentioned and why I haven't discussed that, the answer is I was saving the best for last. Much like we did with our meal where we pushed the BBQ to the side while the seafood took the focus. In hindsight waiting may have been a mistake. We ordered a 1/2lbs of the pulled pork along with some corn bread and man was it good. Not only was it good it was it good it was some of the best pulled pork I have had, and not just in AZ. While not quite on par with my favorites in St. Louis it also wasn't far being either. Was not dried out, had a great smokey flavor while other subtleties of the spice rub used came through. Not to mention that was the biggest 1/2lbs pile of meat I have seen. The BBQ sauce was good as well but not even needed and that says a lot from a sauce lover like me. The cornbread was also great not too mealy and just the right level of sweetness.  I will be back at Angry Crab soon for more delicious goodness especially when it felt like we dined like kings and queens for a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "I'd been to a couple of these \"seafood boil\" places before -- Boiling Crab in California, Hot and Juicy nearby in Tempe -- so the concept wasn't new to me. Regardless, I was so excited to try out this new(er) central Phoenix spot.   A few things: The service? Incredible. Emilie was our server and wow, we have been to a ton of restaurants with our kiddo over the past few years, and no server was as kind and interactive as Emilie.   The atmosphere? Very similar to others of this type of restaurant. Butcher sheet table coverings, writing all over the walls (by guests), very casual attire w/ plastic bibs provided.   The food? We ordered a pound of shrimp at $12 a pound that day, and a fried shrimp kids meal for our child (kids meals are $5 and come with a side and a drink), plus corn ($1 each) and potatoes (50 cents each).   Kids meal came out first. We had to temperature check so we got to try the fries and a small piece of shrimp. Hot but soooo good. We contemplated getting our own fries because they were that good.   Our pound of shrimp came out next, with corn and potato in the bag. With these places you need to peel & devein the food yourself. So, it's a little effort. A pound wasn't enough but we didn't feel like spending another $12 on maybe 12 pieces of shrimp.   The trifecta sauce IS amazing but it tasted like absolutely nothing but the beginning. You need to let your food sit in the bag for a while, like maybe another 5-10 minutes or so, to let the full flavor blend into the food - kind of like letting chili simmer. I wish they'd done that before serving it to us, because by the time I was on my last piece of shrimp I finally got the full flavor. Luckily, I still had some corn and potato left.   Anyway overall, I'll come back to this place when I'm willing to spend a little more, because it IS very flavorful and I'm glad a place like this has come to Phoenix!",

Everything both visits was perfectly steamed except the shrimp . Had the shrimp my 2nd visit. The shrimp was slightly over cooked and therefore very hard to shell and a little chewy, but def still edible. Mussels were right on point and the oysters were large and fresh. All in all a very good experience both times.  Would recommend to anyone that happens to find themselves in central Phx, jonesing for good seafood without the pretensions of the Biltmore area.",

I was disappointed on my first visit to this location in Phoenix after having been to their chandler location once and being insanely impressed by the delicious quality and the service.   Granted the Phoenix location had just opened up so hey we're probably working out some kinks. I ordered a beer which I didn't get until I asked where it was when the food came out. The server returned with a beer that was not the right beer and he said the beer I ordered was out so they gave me this one instead. NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE STYLE I ORDERED(IPA) I received some weird fruity witbier. I did not like it and they didn't have anything else I felt like drinking so I stuck with water. Also part of my order never came out nor was it ever acknowledged that it would not be coming. At this point I was over it and was ready to go. I'll try it again sometime but I just hope for better service when I return.",

Great casual concept with food thats a total treat. as messy as it gets!  even tho there is a wait, it goes quickly and fun to people watch.. as it happens we decided to sit at the bar and eat there, and what a great decision that was, especially since we were lucky to have Ralph take care of us, and that he did..   He embodies what great service should always be, around and full of suggestions and information.  and his suggestions were right on...  he suggested the fireball cider drink.. and wow...  even gave me a sample of the fireball which clinched the deal and it made it through the night for me.. try it.  his suggestions regarding the choices of sea food, the flavors, everything was right on, throughout the meal constantly checking in with us and smiling and making everyone at the bar feel they were guests in his home!  it made the evening so much fun and the food so tasty.  we will def go back.. and hope to find Ralph at his station at the bar !  Thanks man...  ps it was Valentines day and i was with my sister who had never been there.. and just a wonderful fun evening,",

My husband ordered the ribs with beans and potatoes. Also very good. The BBQ sauce has just the right smokey and sweet flavor and the beans and potatoes were great too. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and beans. I loved all of it but the fries were incredible! Crispy and seasoned just right!   The atmosphere is fun with writing all over the walls. There is table seating a bar. It is loud but great for large groups and kiddos. The service is great as well. It was a very busy Friday night and for our party of 3 it only took about 10 minutes to get a table. Bonus points for the text you get when your table is ready!   Special thanks to the staff for the great service throughout and our amazing server Jeff.",

It was one pound of Snow Crab at market price, which at that time was 15 bucks, honestly that's not bad at all if you think about how much a good meal would cost you elsewhere.  The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!  I also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.  The Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!",

I usually go with Snow Crab, they are cheap and already cleaned for you unlike the Dungeness that come whole and need to be cleaned.  I also love their shrimp which are a steal per lb and HUGE!  I am talking prawn size, cooked whole head on with all the delicious juices.    I am a wuss when it comes to spice and I usually ask for a 0 but still feel some heat on my lips.  I also order some bread for soppin to get all those extra juices that are left on the table.  I am not a big shellfish person but my friend loved their raw bar oysters and the mussels.  Mondays are the best days to go for \"Mixed Bag Mondays\".  MBM is house choice of seafood plus mixed veggies for $20.  Get there for happy hour (3-7 PM) for cheap eats and cheaper booze.  This is my go to place when I have friends in town visiting or just a day to treat myself.",

My first experience here was on a typical Friday night I was expecting it to be busy but I didn't expect to get seat in 10mins & to wait another hour in half for my food after ordering . Everything came out slowly & at different times . I was really craving crawfish & once I got my order & dug in, I was very disappointed . I order 2lbs of Live Crawfish Trifecta Medium & every single crawfish was uncooked . I didn't know they were so literal when they asked if I wanted it live or frozen .   My second experience was today, I decided to give this place another shot & beside the waiting from my first experience the crawfish was still uncooked . I'm starting to think that they're serious about the crawfish being live & expecting me to eat it that way . I also ordered clams & there was hardly anything in my bag.. just a lot of seasoning inside the clam shells . So be careful when ordering clams or you'll jst be eating a mouth full of seasonings .  My overall experience was ehh.. okay . I just wish they would learn how to cook the crawfish better . I don't think I'll be giving this location anymore chances but it was worth a try .",

The traditional boil was well spiced at the level we desired.  The trifecta was EXCELLENT!  Super buttery, full flavored garlic without the large chunks or being overbearing.  It was nice to eat this Cajun seafood and not smell of it all day long, unlike many other restaurants similar.  The quality of the king crab was great... The shells crack and break, not bend.  The meat on the ends are white. The pound seems to be True to weight.  They provide a bucket for your shells.  The paper for the table is waxy so it doesn't not easily tear through when wet.  Great overall.",

We went back for the second time to see if it was a fluke the first time (shrimp, potatoes, sausage boil) Tonight, we tried the king crab boil  and the catfish. Both dishes came out fast and were better than expected.  Catfish was a good size with plenty of fries seasoned in a cajun spice. Crab was fresh and seasoned just the right amount.  We have to give a huge round of applause to our server, Chris. He was happy to be there, checked on us the right amount of times, and made sure we had everything we needed. Great job!  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but don't let the strip center facade fool you. Best place for seafood and bbq we have found.",

We had Candice as our server and she was amazing! Very thorough at explaining everything, giving recommendations, refilling drinks promptly, and checking in a few times to see how we were doing.  We started off with the hush puppies. Delicious! Definitely order those. We ordered the snow crab legs and shrimp with a few red potatoes in the trifecta sauce. I can handle spicy, but my mom can not. We ordered the trifecta sauce in a 1 and there was a kick to it! Our server did say they run spicier than normal so order a number down, and she definitely was right! So beware that a level 1 is more like a medium-hot. The trifecta sauce is delicious and flavorful. I highly recommend this place!  FYI: you can ask for plastic gloves to wear when you're eating so that you're not smelling like a fisherman for the rest of the day.",

However, my boyfriend (who is from the south) could not suppress his excitement for the food we were about to eat. The walls are covered in sharpie graffiti, LSU decorations adorn the walls, and butcher paper and no utensils are on the table. To say I was intimidated is an understatement. Jeff (the best server I have ever experienced at any restaurant ever) calmed our fears quickly. With his outgoing personality, customer service orientation, and thoughtful explanation and recommendation, Jeff helped us to order our food. The food is beyond amazing. It is so beyond worth the price. My boyfriend loves that they have live crawfish to boil!   We continually come back to Angry Crab for date night. Our favorite nights are even when Jeff is our server! If it hadn't been for him that first night, we never would have come back for our 5+ time. I tell everyone about Angry Crab (and my experience with Jeff)! My parents even celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary here on my recommendation!   Thanks Jeff and Angry Crab for helping Daulton and I find a restaurant that reminds him of home and tastes so good!",

At this point I believe she purposely didn't because we had a group of 9 or 10 people. She knew she was adding her tips to each separate ticket she she was going to get her money regardless. Not sure of her name she was a young mixed with Maybe black and white fake lashes and bun ponytail. She didn't bring our water to us. Quoted the wrong pricing on drink specials other waitresses had to take our order. She was busy playing with her friends child. If it wasn't my Birthday I would have complained to the manager and not paid a tip at all. However I will be writing a letter to corporate as that is what I do for a living resolve corporate complaints. You never know who you have in your store and pull they have. She has no business in service at all it was horrible. She didn't say Thank you either or say a word when we were leaving. If I had her name I would put her put it out there.",

I looked at the shrimp and noticed is was covered in blacks spots and portions of it were raw. I looked at the others in the bag and they too all had black spots and were clearly spoiled as I have tasted raw shrimp before and this clearly was old and should have never been served to anyone. I just about vomited and asked for a manger that was apologetic, though the next day I was quite ill. They didn't charge us for the food but can't see how anyone could serve spoiled food especially when seafood is your main business. Avoid unless food poisoning is on your to do list.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by stating that I did NOT eat any seafood here, so my review is purely based on their BBQ. I understand this is a popular place for seafood and my friends say it's one of the best in the valley. So I can imagine a seafood review getting at least 4 stars, if not 5. But.... I am here to talk about the BBQ portion of their menu.... which is a 3 star experience at best.  The restaurant itself is very casual and spacious, and has a fun but not overbearing atmosphere. Great place for families and big groups as well as something more casually intimate for 2. I like that there is butcher paper instead of tablecloths... their meals are VERY messy! you also get bibs and gloves if you order the seafood.  The staff is very friendly.   I have been here twice now, and while I can tell my fellow diners really enjoyed their plastic bags full of seafood that you eat by hand, I can't say I was very impressed with their Louisiana style BBQ.  The beef brisket is only slightly tender, but not particularly so. Compared to Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale where the brisket just melts in your mouth, this is just a hair above average. The brisket definitely had a \"smoked\" flavour, but it was not coalescing very well with any flavour from the meat - which seemed a little more dry than it should. It was a smokey flavour that leaned more towards a burnt taste, than a savory beef taste.   There are two sauce options - one is a sugary tangy sweet bbq sauce and the other a New Orleans style mustard. Both were pretty good, though nothing sensational.  On my first visit I got the 2 meat platter - brisket and ribs. While the brisket failed to impress me, the ribs were so forgettable that I can't really think of anything to write about them. They were just very average, not memorable at all.  On my 2nd visit, I decided to try the brisket sandwich. an utter failure! While the meat itself was the same as the platter from my initial visit (at least they are consistent), as a sandwich it was a disaster... because of the bread. Un-toasted Texas toast... with the consistency of a wonder bread. I picked up the sandwich with both hands, and before even 1 bite, it had completely fallen apart. Honestly, I don't get how in the world they get away with calling this a sandwich -  its a nasty mess because of the utterly generic low quality bread. I had to peel off the soggy broken up bread and just ate the brisket with a fork after that. NOT worth $11. no way.  The menu said the sandwich was topped with cole slaw. I asked the waitress to add red onion and she asked \"on the sandwich, with the cole slaw?\" \"yes!\"... well they brought it out and both the slaw and the onion were on the side. So either the waitress was not listening to me, or the cook was not paying attention. Either way, that is how it was brought out to me and it was pretty annoying to have to try and assemble the sandwich myself now - made that much more difficult by the fact that assembly is impossible when you can't even pick it up without it disintegrating in your hands. I had also asked for both sauces on the side, and only 1 came. While they were very nice, the service left a little to be desired. Not to mention we had a table of multiple people and only my food came out first and everyone else sat there for 10 minutes while I awkwardly stared at my food because I didn't want to start eating before anyone was even served! That's just rude and inconsiderate.  Along with the sandwich, which I would NEVER order again, I got a side of cajun fries which were excellent, and a side of mac n cheese that came out ice cold and wasn't that good.   If you are looking for really good BBQ in the valley, I would recommend Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale, and not the Angry Crab and their Louisiana style smokehouse, which is average at best. For seafood? This place is probably quite recommendable, but again, this review is solely to critique the 2nd half of their menu, the BBQ, a \"meh\" experience.",

My husband had 1lb of clams and 1 lb of crawfish. He really enjoyed his as well. There was just a ton of flavor in all the dishes we got. The kids menu was a bit sad BUT the had chicken tenders and fries so my little boys were happy with what they had. The atmosphere is a great family place that I didn't have to worry about my little one getting restless.  My only complaint was the pricing. And I don't mean it was over priced but you HAVE to buy it by the Lb. I would have preferred to get a 1/2 lb each and gotten more if desired.",

I tried the gumbo which was interesting  it had a lot of ocra which made the soup a little  slimy but it was tasty and spicy. We also had the fish poor boy.  Which was large  enough  for two . We had both the two star and the four star trifecta. Plenty of food and good service.",

The manager was more then accommodating! Will be back for sure! Make sure to get the trifecta sauce on your lobster.. and bring your friends.. it's a great place to have fun. It's clean and spacious. Great place seriously.. go eat!",

The sauce I picked for my shrimp was the Trifecta with a medium spice level. The shrimp were overcooked, which you could barely taste the flavor. The catfish was also overcooked, and was overly breaded. The bbq beans were ok, nothing to write home about. I was highly disappointed based of the reviews i heard from others giving this place much praise. Our server was excellent, but that is my only positive thing I can say.",

I've been to places that had better seafood and the same concept so I feel almost spoiled by better places in San Diego, LA and Seattle.

I ordered snow crab with butter and garlic and it was flavorful and quality crab. The fried oysters were fresh and good sized. They come with cocktail sauce (which is not my preference). I asked for tartar sauce and it tasted like the ranch dressing with old bay seasoning (not my favorite). The side of beans were flavorful, a little sweet and a little tang with a thick sauce (how I like it!). The potato salad was a huge miss. It had the old bay type seasoning mixed into it. It's hard to mess up a potato salad, but they managed to do it!  Service was friendly and quick. They refilled our drinks and came by to check on us regularly.  We were there on a Friday, and the place was packed, and the noise level is pretty high.   I like having this seafood option in Phoenix. Prices are reasonable, too!",

The only big issue we had is we walked in and ordered food to go. It was not busy and the hostesses said it would only take about 10 min. The Cardinals game was on, so we were perfectly fine with that... Fast forward 25 minutes later and nothing. We walked up to the hostess to check in and she informed us that our food would be at the bar once ready. She never told us that before. We had been sitting right in front of the bar and right next to the hostess station while our food had been sitting, ready behind the bar, for who knows how long. The food was still warm, but not piping hot. The service could have definitely been better on that!",

While I was pondering...he said yeah you do and brought it to me and charged me for it. I get it that I still drank it but really? Ya you do? Let me answer for myself. Or if you're making the decision for me, you pay for it!  My friend ordered brisket and it looked like it was kind of jelly like. It seemed super fatty and he said it was not appetizing.

    "text": "I am definitely a fan of this place! This was my first time here and we were celebrating some birthdays in the family. Our server, Remy, was great and explained everything clearly. Basically, you can order seafood or BBQ and they have appetizers, sides, plates to choose from. The seafood is by the pound, and 1lb is the recommended start. We all ordered something different and it was a good idea to be able to try from each other's picks. I ordered 1lb of shrimp (which equals about a dozen) with corn and potatoes, and they cook it all together with your choice of sauce (the trifecta is a popular one: lemon pepper, kajun and garlic), the level of heat 0-5 (our server told us she likes spicy food and she orders a 2) all in a bag.   Our orders didn't take too long to come out, the longest was the lobster. Everything was delicious and the 2 is super hot, and I thought I had a decent tolerance for spicy foods. I loved the corn and the shrimp was my favorite from everything I tried. The lobster was also pretty good. The service was great, you get to eat with your hands and they provide plenty of napkins and water. We also had bibs, too. There's a washing station at the back to clean up. This is a fun place to go with family or friends and the walls are filled with signatures and messages; add your own if you find any room!",

Great place to go to but I didn't like that there was a dog allowed inside and it took a dump on the floor. So not cool! The lousy owners of the dog stepped in it and did a quick wipe so employees wouldn't see.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now, both times for special occasions.  This is not your typical \"let's celebrate\" place.  This is a place where you arrive in the clothes that you plan to throw out the next day, put away your cellphones (they'll get sauce all over them if you don't), and prepare to smash crabs with rocks and dig into sauce-filled bags of corn, sausage and crab with your bare hands.  It's primitive and it's amazing.    Trifecta sauce was delicious.  Definitely go mild or one step above mild if you're a spice whimp. The upper levels are killers.  As weird as it seems, pay the extra buck or two in order to add corn and sausage to your bag.  It's delicious.  If you're looking to take someone on a date, but you want to do something slightly non-traditional and also test how chill your potential partner is, I'd highly suggest Angry Crab Shack.  Great way to filter through those Tinder options.",

The food seems bland and served with no culinary enthusiasm. My wife won't go back so I have continued to give it second and third chances by myself.   Cajun seafood is my favorite cuisine. I love fried oysters and clams!!!  I love a cajon seafood boil. I love spreading out newspapers and eating shrimp and crawfish. That's why I hope for improvement.   The owner sent me a personal note after my harsh review. I admire and appreciate that.  I am editing the snottiness out of my critical review. I still think the food is average and could be soooo much better. But with management that is committed to listening and improvement, I wish them well and hope for the best.",

All fun features for a good eating!  This marks the 3rd location of all the Angry Crab establishments - located in the same plaza as Starbucks. (3 down and one more to go). It's the Angry Crab and BBQ. Even though the BBQ part is \"newer\" addition to the original restaurant I was only looking forward to seafood!  Walked in through a mini hallway entrance to the hostess podium and the hostess walked a couple to their table. Waited for less than a minute and another host came out running to greet us and brought us to our table. One half of the restaurant was completely empty while the bar was slim and the west side of the restaurant was 80% full. All the booths were taken so we took at seat at the regular tables. Like the other 2 restaurants there was a washing station, TVs, paper \"table cloths\"   What to get??   ......BOLD signifies my faves........ Choose It: (by the pound) - MUSSELS. SNOW CRAB LEGS. Lobster. Dungeness crab. Shrimp. Crawfish. Clams. KING CRAB LEGS. Blue crab. Catfish. Salmon. Vegetables. $5-market  Sauce It: - Cajun. Lemon pepper. Garlic. TRIFECTA (all 3 prior). Traditional Boil. Pacific Rim (like a sweet coconut curry sauce). Sweet N Tangy (haven't tried)   Spice It:  - no spice. MILD. Medium. Hot. Angry Ghost. Scorching Scorpion. ( I never went beyond medium)  This time around our top picks for the day were King crab legs, mussels, shrimp, corn on the cobs (half sizes) $1 each. red potatoes ($0.50 each) all with the mild trifecta sauce, and an Angry Basket: fried soft shell crab that comes with seasoned fries $12.   Samson was our smiley and super server who perfected his name written upside down and gave us our \"toolbox\" on out paper table cloth. Love that! A+  Fried Soft shell crab breading was a bit much for me. Everything else was yummy! Mussels were of decent size at this location.    Overall 4 out of 5. Can't be angry with the Angry Crab.",

I order came up to $120.00 with drinks. We took  some clams to go. We got home. Family started to eat my clams. They where clams with no meat just the shells. I was disappointed. Made me not to take out anymore. It was a lot of money for them. I was mad. I didnt  want to drive back over there. I said I'm going to call them in the morning. My family said don't take out anymore. That was a ripped off. It's a amazing fun place.",

And FYI a pound  of king Crab For 30.00 yielded one nice piece of claw meat Don't bother with the rubberized fried clams and the burnt horribly doughy hush puppies!

I use to work at the place that's how much I loved their food. The place has completely gone down hill since the last time I was there... The food use to be amazing I took my mom and her friend there, I had been raving about it. As such a unique place. Having worked there at one time I felt I had an edge on what was good but I was very disappointed. It wasn't just me who was disappointed my mom and her friend were also let down by their meal we ordered my old favorites: snow crab traditional boil 2 with sausage, potatoes, and corn. The crab was way over cooked and I don't think they put any spice in it maybe they have gotten too many complaints on the spice level but I was looking forward to not feeling my lips. Then there was the fried shrimp and Cajun fries. The shrimp tasted like rubber and the fries tasted like they were cooked 3 hours earlier. Then there was the mac n Cheese my once favorite.... it was luke warm and Missing the signature jalopeno. I never give bad reviews but I was really disappointed in the food quality. What happened this place use to be so amazing.",

We will definitely be back, and we recommend asking for Ashley.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place a couple of weeks to work out the kinks but I'm not sure that was even necessary. I sat with some friends at the bar last week for a good few hours and even then I didn't want to leave. The bartenders, Kristen and Ralph, were outstanding. Both had a very impressive understanding of the menu and made REAL recommendations. I hate when you ask a bartender or server menu questions and they have zero opinion or just say, \"everything is great.\" Kristen and Ralph recommended a great starter on sauce and heat so I could gauge where I wanted to go from there. But that's just the service....the food is also a star! We had the oysters, shrimp, crab and some of the add ins like sausage and potatoes. The trifecta sauce is so good I now want it on every meal every day. And the medium heat was just right although I'm ready to give hot a try.  Myself and my friends are bar people so we were very pleased that this place delivers with big TVs, happy hour specials and entertaining bar staff. Those two probably kept us around for an extra round of food and drinks because we were made to feel so welcome.  Finally someone made good use of this space and brightened it up as it felt like a dungeon before. Add this place to the very regular neighborhood rotation.",

The brisket was the best by far, very smoky and tender, thus the 3 stars I gave. The ribs were okay, but there was only 3 tiny ribs...disappointing. The pork was just ok. I've had better in Tempe and ahwatukee. Service was ok but only some servers had it together. Ambiance was typical of a BBQ place, good laid back spot to have a brew and watch a football game. Unlike other reviews I read I didn't feel like it was loud at all.",

The food arrives in a bag, cooked in a traditional  creole boil style. The seafood is very busy,  whole pieces that require work to get the meat out. The staff are very educational if you are not seafood savy. The brisket was goid, not top of the line. Nice char, lots of flavor. Tried the creole bbq sauce, slight spice with a strong hint of mustard. An overall enjoyable meal.",

My husbands crab tasted pretty good, a lot more flavor this time. I had gotten a 1lb of brisket. I'm not a big fan of their sides that come with the BBQ. I tried to order onion rings and potato salad but my server stated I can order onion rings in lew of the 2 sides that I get to pick from their small collection of sides. My husband got his food a good 10 minutes before I received mine. Half of my brisket was well over cooked and extremely dry. I didn't even have 10 onion rings, even though I'm technically paying for 2 sides and only getting 1. I don't know if the difference between my experiences are because of the week vs. weekend but I know I will never go during a weekday again.",

    "text": "I don't think there are enough words to convey how much I loved my first experience at Angry Crab Shack.  I had been wanting to try it forever, and my sister and her husband surprised me by taking me here for my birthday.  First of all, know that this restaurant is not for the faint of heart--it is loud and as far away from white linen dining as you can get.  But you have to love a place where you're encouraged to eat with your hands, right?  We ordered a pound of shrimp, an order of the catfish, and a soft-shelled crab w/fries.  Just to let you know how delicious everything was, this dinner happened almost two months ago and I'm still fantasizing about it.  It was so good, easily the best meal I've had in a long time.  I had such a great time.  Just don't forget to order a couple pieces of sausage for the seafood, it is so tasty.  The one and only negative thing I have to say about the whole experience is that their desserts are not that great.  Granted, I understand people don't eat here for the cheesecake, but it was a bit disappointing.  Despite that, the next time I come (and you can bet there will be a next time), I might be tempted to smuggle in a loaf of crusty bread to sop up that delicious broth at the bottom of the bag.  Yum yum!",

We got there at 4 in the afternoon and it was very busy. Our waiter was Dion, he is an awesome guy. Dion took his time explaining everything on the menu and brought everything before I could ask. I ordered the BBQ pitmasters platter with the #5(Maximum heat) creole Q sauce on the side with cajun fries. My platter choices were ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were meaty and seasoned just right, the brisket was moist, delicious and gone in seconds and lastly the pulled pork was smoked to perfection. The creole Q #5 is sooooo hottttt, I loved every second of it. I even took the extra sauce home for later. I was so full I had to turn down the desserts that Dion kept tempting me with. I will definitely be back to devour some BBQ and next time some of the yummy seafood (I've had it before too and it's some of the best seafood in AZ) .",

Reminds me of Florida where I lived for 14 years and going back to next week for good. The decor the set-up of the restaurant reminds me of Florida. Most of all the food reminds me of Florida. I had 2 servings of the raw oysters, the brisket/rib combination with corn and baked beans and it was soooo good! The brisket literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. I had the jalapeno (level 2) sauce and it gave it that extra kick which really set off the flavor of the meat. My GF had the salmon with rice and hush puppies. The salmon was pretty close to perfect with white rice and came with coleslaw. All was really good. Our server was Lexie (?) who was very knowledgeable and accommodating and believed in the product she was selling. For being on the job for a week she was very professional and knew her job. My only regret was that I didn't find this place sooner as I would be here two-three times a week.",

Love the wash bins for cleaning off the mess and No, you will never force me to wear a bib even though I would save the messy shirt if I would just listen...LOL. Found out I was allergic to Cayenne pepper when I ordered the hot boil and contacted their management off their website. I ran through a few possible ingredients without them actually giving away their \"secret recipe\" and determined it was Cayenne. Management made recommendations to me on what to order next time to make sure a visit to the ER wasn't needed and we rolled with it. Lemon Pepper was absolutely delicious and I appreciated that they were willing to help me return and not write off this place. This place is great for large groups and well worth the experience.

    "text": "Met up here for UYE and so happy I did. The food here is delicious. Choices include country boils of shrimp, crab, mussels, clams with additions of sausage and potatoes. There are several choices and levels of spice with the heat ranging from mild to wow. I had shrimp, clams and sausage with the trifecta sauce at spice level 3. Very tasty! I also had some plump, delicious Gulf oysters and tasted the charred oysters that someone at the table ordered. Unfortunately they were out of the crab. All of the boiled items are sold by the pound. The boils are prepared and delivered to your table in individual plastic bags, complete with the sauce. Eating your selection is messy but it sure is tasty. There is a good selection of draft beers and I believe their is also a full bar. The dessert selection is rather skimpy. Some of us headed for the dessert section of the nearby Whole Food store to satisfy our sweet tooth. It's a good thing that I don't live closer to Angry Crab, because I would be there a couple times a week. As Arnold said, \"I'll be back\". If you enjoy country boils and crustaceans you've got to try this place.",

The crabs were cooked perfect! They slid out in one complete piece, meaning they were cooked to right. Makes for a crab sit down that much better. My only suggestion would be to offer old bay by itself as an option. Could have been one and I simply missed it. I love to mix a wee bit of old bay into melted butter for my shrimp and crab. Super impressed Angry Crab! Super impressed. I grew up on the beach and in the bay, still live there, and can name several local joints that can't hold a claw to your food :)! I will definitely be back when I come to visit next year!",

I ordered the brisket with baked beans and potato salad. The brisket came out plain with the sauce on the side. I don't prefer it that way, I like it served covered in sauce. It was tasty though. The beans were good although it was a very tiny side. I gave the potato salad to my boyfriend in exchange for his Cajun fries which were very good. He ordered the charred oysters, which he seemed to like. The oysters came with bread which I wish my waiter would have let us know, cause we ordered a extra side of bread that we did not eat. Good thing it was only $1 extra. This was ok for a first time try, next time I will try out some of the good looking drinks.",

    "text": "Oh Angry Crab Shack, God bless you!!! I will be brutally honest and say that I was not a huge fan of the Mesa location for plenty of reasons (LOCATION, inconsistent taste/spice levels of the sauces, price) however we kept coming back to get our seafood boil fix because of the lack of this type of restaurant here. It slowly grew on us as the recipe kept improving. And by the time THIS location opened, it has been perfected! Yay! My family came in on day 2 of the opening and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 5 minutes. Hallelujah! I celebrated my new job here and there was no better place I would have rather been. Our server was a total sweetheart. So attentive and charismatic as are almost all the servers we get when we come in. We don't come in without several pounds of shrimp in Trifecta sauce (mild or medium). The shrimp are sizable compared to their competition. The clams are always good as well but sometimes we can skip it if we don't want to go too crazy... because of course we HAVE to get the BBQ... Oh my goodness... Their brisket is SUPERB. ACQ sauce mild is the way to go. I think now their BBQ dishes comes with 2 choices of meat and we have tried their ribs but I highly recommend sticking with double brisket. BBQ also comes with 2 sides but we ALWAYS opt to substitute for cajun fries. Oh those fries... careful because you won't be able to stop eating them. We've had to get additional orders of those fries on more than 1 occasion. We have come here on weekends and weekdays on all sorts of different hours of the day but NEVER had to wait more than 5 minutes on a table. The place is huge, much bigger than the Mesa location. I love this restaurant!!! Thank you for being in my life, Angry Crab Shack! Arizona needed this.",

One guy did come to put a ketchup bottle on our table, but even he didn't say hello or say that our server will be right with us. We felt completely invisible. It was 915pm and it was not busy at all, so there should be no excuse as to why we were treated this way. I was hungry and angry which is not a good combination so I finally decided to get up and speak to someone. The waiter directed me towards the manager. The manager Derek was extremely nice and wanted to sit down and talk about this. I am sure he would've done his best to rectify the situation, but I had already lost all desire to eat here. Also, being that I am from los angeles I have the REAL boiling crab to eat from, not some sad knock off.",

When she circled our utensils on the table , she let us know she would check to see if they were put back,  We could hear  a server at another table explaining the menu very patiently.  No interest in going back, too many other good places with great service  to go to in the area,  I couldn't say if the food was that great or not,  the lousy server ruined the meal for us.

It was \"Mixed bag Monday\" so we went with that, with trifecta sauce and level 1 spice. It was perfect for me because I am not a spicy eater at all. The trifecta sauce is AMAZING! Highly recommend. The mixed bag includes snow crab legs, king crab legs, shrimp and assorted veggies. We also threw in a few baby reds. The bag was 2# and cost $25. It was a great deal for the amount of food you get.  A couple of things to remember: -Others have said it gets super busy and I can definitely see how that is the case. Plan your time if you don't want a long wait. -The waiters are FUN! Go and have a blast.  -Be prepared to get messy. Your food is served in a bag, drenched in sauce. It comes whole...heads, eyes, etc. Be ready to peel. With your hands.   I highly recommend this place and will return as much as possible!",

The food was a lot better then, tasty and flavorful and the service WAS great too. I went this week and and my experience prompted me to never return. Both the service and food were HORRIBLE.   Right from the start our experience was bad. It took a while for the waitress to come and when she did she did not appear to be happy to serve us. .My husband mentioned it was our daughters birthday ( she loves crab and that is why we went) the waitress responded with a disinterested OK...she is 3.  We placed our order of crab legs in with trifecta with corn on the cob, potatoes, and vegetables. We waited an unusually time for our food which was odd.We went during lunch and the place was not busy at all. The waitress came back to our table to repeat our order. We were finally brought out a bag of shrimp. We told the person bringing the food who was not our waitress we did not order that. She took it back, we waited and wanted to know if our order was correct since no one bothered to come back to our table, and flagged someone down to find our waitress. She came and we asked about order and she said the crab legs were coming without further explanation.   We finally received the crab legs in the bag.. without the potatoes and corn on the cob we ordered with it. We again flagged someone down ( at LUNCH TIME in a unbusy restaurant) and asked to speak to the manager. We told him about the missing items and issues with our waitress. He apologized offered to get the missing items which we promptly declined do to the wait time, and revealed it was his 2nd day on the job. He said we would make sure we were not charged for our items we ordered but never received. Ugh...  The food was not good. The snow crab legs were scrawny and tasteless and a bag with more claws than you expect. BAD FOOD...at $18.00 a pound x2.   I did not see the waitress after we were ready to pay so went up to the bar so I could get my bill and pay and she was there, I asked for my bill and it was wrong. I was still charged for the corn on the cob and potatoes we did not receive and the manger assured us he would correct the error, and I was charged twice for both item. I Pointed out this mistake and she was surprised I did not receive the items. Then she argued with me about being charged twice.   In summary, my review of  Angry Crab, from someone who loved them at one time....BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE...stay away.",

All the other employees were also so nice from the different runners bringing you food and emptying your table to the one guy who put soap on my hand when I was having a hard time at their wash station, everyone not only works as a team here but they are friendly and make you feel like you're the only one at the restaurant.  The food was delicious! Not only are there a bunch of different options of sea food but you get a nice selection of sauces to go with it and different spicy-ness levels also. I had a meat platter of brisket and chicken and it was all so juicy and perfectly cooked. They sure did a good job of catering to our needs and this is a place we are going to be visiting often, I am planning on bringing my parents here sometime soon too.",

Turned out to be a little longer than I thought, but once the contact was made things moved a bit quickly and fairly smoothly.

Served in a bag with everything tossed in with the spices (I recommend the Cajun and lemon combos).  I had corn/sausage and potatoes.  It was great-the sausage they use was phenomenal.  My friend had the bbq-we are from Kansas City....he said it was good, but like I said we are probably bbq snobs.  I also had the chocolate cake..which was not very good.  But I'm not rating the place on the cake-if you like crab try it.  Prepare to get your hands dirty!",

I understand why, the food is so good, the boil bags are made to anyone's pallet.  The shrimp were huge and tasty.   Beans were fantastic and my cousin loved her Cole slaw and her French Fries.  She lives here locally so she plans going  again and I will be back on another Arizona trip.   The wait staff were really  helpful, especially when it's your first time, explains how it works.  It's  casual  and the prices are so reasonable, wear your bib, dig in, enjoy and they have soap and water to clean yourself.   I think it's great for kids.   Wish there was on in Southern California, I will be back and so will be my cousin.",

You walk in and it has a authentic west coast feel but, the quality of food was very poor. Ordered the gumbo and I believe it was canned and if it wasn't then I have had better canned gumbo. It was very slimy and just resembled brown muck. Not appealing! Fried oysters tasted canned with a metallic aftertaste. The shrimp PO'Boy had 4 popcorn shrimp with blankets of breading on a large roll. The coleslaw was average nothing special. The brisket sandwich was dry and over done and the bread fell apart before we could even pick it up.  I am afraid to order Lobster or crab as it would be a big waste of money. Sorry but not worth the money!",

So the shrimp were great, big and firm but the frog legs were as my toddler would say \"yucky\",I could tell they were from a lake or something muddy they tasted like I had just swallowed a mouth full of muddy water. I had my hopes up on introducing new food to my bf and he couldn't stomach it. Besides everything being fried, our fave were the shrimp and andoullie sausage.",

    "text": "Going to the same restaurant TWICE within two weeks speaks for itself!!!  First visit was recently on a Friday night. Restaurant was crowded, but that was expected when walking in the door shortly after 6pm. I put my name on the waitlist and was told the wait would be 20-25 minutes-but about five minutes later we were immediately seated in a booth! (This might be due to larger parties, or perhaps because we were only a party of 2, perhaps?). Since I had read previous reviews, I had a good idea of what to order: We chose 2# of Snow Crab in the Trifecta sauce, Heat #2. Added 4 red potatoes and the smoked sausage. Couldn't have been more perfect. Added a side of hush puppies, which were also delicious-crunchy on the outside, but hot and moist on the inside! Only downside was the 1/2 pound of bbq brisket that we ordered as an appetizer. Five slices, that although moist, was nothing to rave about. Since Kansas City is my hometown, had high expectations. But perhaps it was an off night for bbq? Pulled pork might have been a better choice, but we went on the recommendation of our server. She was very friendly and attentive. Lots of dining help that frequently stopped by to either fill our water or empty our overflowing bucket of eaten crab. I raved about this place to everyone at work(high praise since I lived in Seattle previously before moving back here). I couldn't wait to go back! And I did. Last night with my best friend. Ordered the exact same as mentioned above but nixed on the brisket. He totally LOVED the food. I also ordered some fried oysters, fried calamari and hushpuppies to go for lunch the next day...what can I say, this place ROCKS!!!  Angry Crab, keep doing what you do, and you will have a loyal following ;)",

Our crab had to be sent back twice (on the advice of the server!!!) which is never a good sign. We didn't try for a third time!  Shrimp boil was ok, but the additional spices take away from the more natural \"Old Bay\" style seafood boil flavor that we enjoy.    While the server was very apologetic and embarrassed , we would have expected the manager to come by the table to apologize at a minimum and to comp the meal at the maximum.

All kinds of fresh seafood served in shells in bags with varied levels of spiciness and multiple sauce choices. Wow the king crab was incredible! The blue crab was almost as good... the oysters alone will make me come back; possibly the biggest and juiciest i've ever had. As a transplant from the east coast, this Cajun seafood paradise is a must hit! Also worth mentioning is the servers and the hostess were on their game and I felt a sense of team oriented customer service. Great food, great service, see you soon.",

Gator? Oh yeah, LOVED the gator bites, and the dipping sauce that came with them. I had snow crab with Cajun sauce and a spice level 3- I like spicy, but I still want to be able to taste my food, and level 3 took me just to the limits of my spice comfort zone, so I'll scale back next time. The hubby had traditional boiled crab with level 0 spice... He thinks ketchup is hot. The bad news: they still put Cajun seasoning on them, and he thought they were too hot. Suggestion: put \"just steamed and unseasoned\" on the menu for Tenderfoots- at least on the secret menu!! (otherwise I won't be able to come back). I had abita's purple haze- raspberry wheat beer. Yummmm! Just a hint of berry, definitely not too sweet, great stuff :-) now for the reason for a mere 4 stars: NOISY!!! and we weren't allowed to sit outside on this absolutely gorgeous evening for lack of a server! I almost forgot to mention: I love that you order pretty much everything a la carte- the other places sell you a whole meal and charge you for everything in it, so you're stuck with sides you can't really squeeze into your belly if you plan on eating all your sea food. Here, you buy the seafood by the pound, if you think you want a veggie, you add it, if you really think you have room for potatoes, add them. But if you really just want to gorge yourself on meat, you won't be paying for stuff you didn't want. Good thinking!!!",

    "text": "Having read rave reviews about the Mesa location, I eagerly awaited coming to this one when it opened.  But now having tried it twice, I'd not go back.  My dining companion concurred.   The food is adequate, but it's the \"experience\" that is bizarre.  First, our service was pretty bad. The waitress did come to \"apologize profusely\" at the end fo the meal to ensure she was well tipped, but she was MIA during the meal. We flagged down whomever wandered by.  Second, the noise level was so over-the-top, conversation was impossible.  But if one doesn't mind not conversing, that can be overlooked too.  The troubling part of the meal is having to put your paws, along with your dining companions so hope they've not just picked their noses or don't have the flu, in a big plastic bag.  At the bottom of the bag is the sauce and your food.  We asked and tacky styrofoam plates and the cheapest of plastic cutlery was brought so we didn't have to eat our coleslaw with our fingers,,,apparently the plan....and had a place to lay down our crab.    I understand takeout in plastic bags, but really, can't they bring the food in a bowl or on a tray, which is how one usually is served this kind of food at myriad restaurants around the country.  Too unsanitary for me.  Not to mention the sauce IS IN THE bottom of the bag.  I'd rather have it on my food I'm eating or be able to dunk the seafood in it.  Despite showers and numerous hand-washing, the stench of the seafood sauce didn't disappear for days.  I don't mind eating with my hands, and in fact, did for a year living in India.  But it's the community bag of food to paw through that is just plain weird and unappealing.  The shrimp was only so-so, the crab was good, and the sides of hush puppies and coleslaw were average.  Unless they change the serving method, we'll not go back.   On my first trip b/c alone, i tried a p'oor boy sandwich, having had wonderful ones at other restaurants.  This one was dry with a bland sauce. Ordering a spicier sauce (for which I was charged extra), it improved the taste, but still not of a caliber that I'd eat it again.  I decided to return with friends where we could try the seafood by the pound cuisine.    Plastic bags for takeout is fine, but not for dining in!  At $20 per pound, it would seem they could serve the food on a tray or a serving bowl with a serving spoon.",

This time I was looking for some great fried shrimp because I just haven't found any in the Phoenix area. What I was served instead was Costco (seriously) frozen fried shrimp and luke warm, limp Cajun fries wannabes. Maybe I should go there for the BBQ???",

I got the fish and chips and it was great you could totally split it with someone! I was also a fan of the sauces! I got a level 5 Cajun to dip my fish and chips in and it was great! If you like spicy don't be scared to try the level 5 it's perfect. It is not a very good place to go on a first date because of how messy the food can be and it is also very loud! They blow this whistle or something like every 3 minutes. It get pretty annoying till your 3rd beer then you don't even notice it! I would recommend going with a group of friends!",

I selected my favorite seafood-- fried softshell crab and gumbo. Crab was perfectly crispy fried but inside was tasteless mush. Can't even guess what was wrong. Gumbo was ok but would not be tolerated in La. without a lot more cayenne.    Friend had mussels, they were real good w/trifecta sauce. Will be back on next trip to try shrimp and crawfish.",

Shrimp was cooked well and tasted great. Cost was reasonable. There was a bar and a lot of people celebrating birthdays. It is a family environment. Definitely would return for the brisket.",

They had everything from light beers to craft options. The bar was full and they didn't have any small tables nearby so I had to sit at a large high-top. The service was great with attentive waitresses that had a great attitude.   I enjoyed the style of the menu. You can choose a bag or a basket and an array of sides. I chose the simple fried fish and chips because there were not very many cheap options that weren't fried. It was a TON of food. If you are going on an empty stomach and starving, it would likely be perfect. I would have been happy to split this with a friend.   Great for family dinners and out-of-towners craving seafood! I wish they had a healthy options section on the menu, but if price is not a problem, you can certainly make it a very healthy meal!",

I came for the shrimp which I ordered trifecta mild, but this time the mild seasoning was spicier than the precious 2 times and I DONT like spicy at all, my personality is spicy enough. We order the king crab legs the same way, they were just ok, kind of dry and definitely NOT worth $28 a pound. I will definitely be back to angry crab m, but I will just stick to the shrimp.",

I am a BBQ hound and these were some of the best I've had.  I was blindsided by them as I was expecting regular restaurant ribs.    Seriously, the only thing better than a seafood feast with some cold beers is a seafood feast with some cold beers and ribs.    I love this place.

They changed from red potatoes to russet potatoes (recently? tonight? Couldn't get a straight answer) and they were mushy and inedible. Waitress shrugged and said she didn't know they had different potatoes, manager shrugged and said \"I can comp the add on charge, if you want\". I know, we're not there for the potatoes per se, but the total lack of f**ks given put a damper on the whole dinner. The service...was TERRIBLE. I don't know if Katie was having a bad day or if that's her normal pissy attitude, but after waiting close to 10 minutes just to place our initial order, we didn't see her again except for the time I stopped her to ask about those infernal potatoes. No refills on drinks, no \"can I get you anything else?\", nothing. We were there pretty early on a Sunday evening and it wasn't busy, so there was no excuse for the poor service. The manager seemed to also be boycotting customer service, and our concerns were merely shrugged off. I saw him talking to the waitress after leaving our table, but when she brought the check there was no apology or anything.  For what it costs to dine there, it was a very disappointing evening out. May be worth driving to a different location based on service alone.",

First, after ordering a beer the tap went out, only crap bud light available. Then we ordered the brisket dinner, told the last of it was just served. Ordered the wings, which easily took over 20 minutes. We also ordered muscles and they were awesome but by the time all of our food come or dinner party had long since finished. The worst of it was walking by someone eating the brisket on our way out. Disappointing for sure.",

Celest was our server and was fabulous.  She was very thorough in explaining the menu and the different options available.  She asked us questions and then gave suggestions based on our answers.  You have a lot of options, so that was very helpful.  We got a couple appetizers and multiple bags.  We had a couple different shrimps, crabs, and all of the add ons.  She was super sweet and made our experience a ton of fun.  What a sweetheart she is.  To the management of Angry Crab Shack, on Indian School Rd, we will be back and you have a keeper in Celest.  I work with the general public and know it is not always easy, but she was great.  Your establishment was clean and all of your employees were very nice.  We even had one of the servers take our family photo and asked Celest to be in it.  Our daughter is 27 and had a blast.  Thank you for helping us to have a great experience.",

    "text": "I'm so glad this place is so close to me and man am I glad I started eating seafood again! This place is always packed all day everyday but especially towards dinner; so prepare to arrive early and don't be surprised by the wait time.  It's also super loud in there but the atmosphere is cool plus they let you write your name on the wall.   Yesterday I tried calling in my order for takeout and no one picked up and when I tried calling back, they had unplugged their phone?? Luckily, I live close and decided to drive there and place my order, but that would suck for the people who don't live so close to the restaurant. So this is my reason for not giving it 5 stars as well as another reason: when I was ordering, I asked the girl if they charge extra to take off the head of the shrimp and she didn't answer me and just ran off to place my order. So i figured that was a \"no\" and I shouldn't have because when I got the bill, they tacked on $3. I wanted to say something but I just let it go (too nice? Lol) Plus they were too busy to even get ahold of.   FOOD: I ordered the pound of shrimp in trifecta sauce (lemon pepper, kajun, and garlic) and it was amazing. On past visits, I have also ordered their soft shell crab sandwiches and that was tasty as well. However, one thing I cannot recommend trying here is their fried cod and catfish. It doesn't really have much flavor and the breading isn't that great either. I think it was too thick if I remember correctly; just stick to their shellfish.   All in all, it's a busy, fun, and delicious seafood spot - probably the best one in Phoenix. So definitely try it.",

Did I say it was DELICIOUS?!! I don't think I left anything in that basket. LoL  It also has bar seating, outdoor seating, and several TV's that are perfect for sports gatherings.

I wasn't a fan of it but maybe I could have been if it was drenched in the seasoning. My boyfriend got a shrimp po boy with fries. He left most of the fries because they woo we're coated with a ton of seasoning. So it was just ok at best and I'm pretty sure our waiter was high!",

Rejeana was our waitress and was great, she walked us through how everything worked, which spices worked best with what, and what her favorite was. I got the gumbo too and it was really good!!!

    "text": "Since planning another trip to Florida, my sister has been nonstop with her \"demand\" that we return back to the Angry Crab Shake. Based on my previous reviews  I was all for it, but this time I returned with some new mouths. What a disaster!!! I know I will NOT be returning... period! It's a shame I can't remember the name our waiter the first time we visited.   1.Kate took our drink order and disappeared for a good amount time, what I observed was she was helping a coworker straighten up tables/chairs. Ok... but you still have a table to wait on. They could've wait until the orders were placed or maybe another coworker could've assisted.  2. My sister ordered 1 lbs of crab legs with FRIED SHRIMP. What was brought to the table was a bag of crabs and shrimps with the head on them. (Hey... everyone has a preference, however, under no circumstances was she eating this), hence, the reason for ordering the fried shrimp. Kate came to the table and flat out lied that she explained the orders came with heads on and a separate order of fried shrimp would have to be placed, then she snatched the bag off the table and never returned, she abandoned the table over a mistake SHE MADE, My niece actually fell asleep at the table waiting on her food, the crabs finally came out but we decided to take them home, only to discover later on that night the sauce on them was so hot that it literally burned my sister's lips. Obviously it was done purposely! Janice (thank you!) ended up taking care of our table for the duration of the time we were there. If my elder mother and young children weren't with us, we would've left! I don't believe in giving any type of business my money with attitudes such as this.  As we were getting our tips together, I overheard Kate telling another coworker, \"It's only $30\" (obviously meaning the tip she lost out on)  How ridiculous! Angry Crab Shake... don't worry... you won't have to see my face again.",

Crab was pretty good but it's a bit tricky to get all the crab when all they give you is a pair of scissors.  I do like the fact that you can order crawfish.  They have a hand washing station at the back which is a nice touch.  Unfortunately the large garbage bin full of table scraps sitting right beside it was a bit distracting and not in a good way.    Service was a bit slow considering it was a weeknight.  Graffiti on all the walls gives it that super casual feel.",

We have had better quality fish in the past but the fish here is fresh and that Trifecta sauce is so delicious and garlicky it just makes it all that much better. We ordered the french bread to sop up the sauce and even the warm soft fresh bread was buttery and garlicky. We started with sharing a pound of mussels and I moved on to the crab legs in trifecta sauce with zero heat; perfect for me and there were two large clusters of legs so more then enough to eat. My husband got the crayfish with the trifecta sauce and level 3 heat and he said next time he would try level 4 because level 3 wasn't as spicy as he thought it would be. For fish the prices aren't bad but for lunch it could be considered pricey. We paid $54.00 with tip. Our server Arron was great very personable and knowledgeable about the menu. Thank goodness for the bibs and lots of paper towels at the table because you will be a sloppy mess when you get done but it is worth it.",

Do not miss out on this awesomeness.  We got the Dungeness trifecta which is cajun, lemon pepper and garlic (level 3 I can't feel my lips HOT) with corn on the Cobb, red potatoes and some bread for sopping. They have levels of spice from 0 to 5 and many different sauces to choose from. The combination is phenomenal you will not be disappointed. Service was okay but the food blew my mind.  Seafood is priced by the pound our crab was under 2 pounds and came to $40 which is quite reasonable. For the corn, potatoes and bread they charge separately.  I'm definitely going back.  Cheers!",

    "text": "The feel of this place is like a Joe's Crab Shack. Very casual, like being on a sail boat of wood. You can also catch the game on tv.  You are seated at a table that has a long sheet of paper covering, warning you of the mess you're about to partake in.  As a note, towards the back of the restaurant, there's some water tanks that hold crabs in one, and lobster in the other. Freshest of fresh food! For starts, we got a shrimp plate - our came with fries which were super tasty, and great with the Cajun mayo. The shrimp were good too. It's fun to check out the menu. They offer different shell fish - blue crab, Dungeness Crab, snow crab, king crab legs, shrimp, and their famous crawfish. You then get to select your seasoning which there's about 7-8 you can choose from, next select your spice level, and lastly, you can add in sausage, corn, potatoes, or veggies. I opted for the snow crab, trifecta seasoning at mild and added sausage. I was afraid this was going to be really spicy, which I can't tolerate right now... and this was a perfect combination.  It had just the slightest kick and very flavorful. A pound really filled me up and I couldn't even touch the sausage.  My husband got the pick 2 meats with ribs and pulled pork. We were impressed with the amount of food that came with and it was very good.  Overall, we loved it and will definitely return. I just wish they had a combo bag that you could get crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs.",

I think I could have gone to a 4 because I didn't think the food was very spicy after the first bite.  If you order a spiciness of 5 or 6, you will be blasted with a fog horn when your food is served. That way everybody knows that there is a crazy person in the restaurant who wants to BURN.  They have a very acceptable list of beers on tap as well as a full bar.   Do they have dessert? Probably, but most people will be so full after their main course they will skip dessert.  Definitely the owners have figured out a way to make food eating fun and to make their customers extremely happy.",

    "text": "For the last few weeks I have had a hankering for seafood. But in landlocked Arizona finding quality seafood can be a challenge. Since Seattle and Boston are not in my near term travel plans, I have been doing some scouting for a good seafood joint right here in the valley.  Today I struck pay-dirt at the Angry Crab thanks to guidance from Yelp reviews.  This is a no-nonsense joint in Phoenix. Quite a hike from Scottsdale but it was worth the 30 some miles I drove to get there.  My lunch consisted of half a dozen charred oysters to get warmed up and a modest 2 pound Dungeness crab. Both items more than exceeded my expectations.  The Dungeness was exceptional. You choose the size of the crab, select the type of sauce you want, decide on the level of heat on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 denotes wimpy and 5 is ghost pepper). Finally you decide if you want to add items such as veggies (about half a dozen options). The crab is delivered to you in a bag and the fun starts.  Having had the opportunity to relish spicy crab in Singapore on a number of occasions, I can attest to the fact that this preparation was as good, if not better, than the Singaporean variety.  Staff was friendly and efficient. The ambience is a cross between a sports bar and a gastropub.  This is one for the books.",

As it currently stands, you have to order a whole order of mussels, clams, lobster, crab, etc. when all I want is a mix and match of it all. I get a little bummed trying to choose one of the options.. but ordering more than one becomes not only expensive, but way too much food.  So it would be awesome if they had a set \"mix and match\" or half and half option so that you can get a little bit of each type of seafood you like.   Also - I would advise against the snow crab - go for the king crab. I know it's more expensive - but as dirty as my hands get trying to crack the crab open - it becomes a really big effort to open the smaller legs. Trust me.  I am sure to be going back - but to save for a treat or when they have a mix and match day.",

This location has both seafood AND BBQ to satisfy everyone's cravings. They have a good selection of drinks (Mexican Coke ftw!) and serve a variety of craft beers which is always a plus in my book.  I went with the alligator plate because I've never had alligator before and thought it'd be a good time to try it. Everyone always says it tastes like chicken but I say it tastes like BETTER chicken! :P My sides included BBQ beans and Cajun fries which are far and away better than those of Five Guys. I have to say though that the winningest ingredient of the entire lunch was the sauce. I got a Trifecta #2 (slightly spicier than mild) which hit the spot. I also tried some of my coworker's Trifecta #5 (extremely spicy) and was downing water for like 5 minutes while my mouth was literally on fire haha! Definitely a challenge, and not sure I could stomach #6. Can't wait to come back for a bag of their seafood!",

You choose the type of seafood you would like along with the type of sauce and level of spiciness....you can also order vegetables in the boil bag as well.  We ordered the king crab which was meaty and juicy.  I would suggest ordering the bread to sop up all of the juice inside the bag which was really delicious and flavorful. They had a decent selection of beers that were reasonably priced. Be prepared for a shockingly loud siren to go off when someone orders the spiciest sauce or is celebrating a birthday. We initially happened to be sitting right next to the siren and almost fell off of our barstools, luckily we held onto our frosty beverages and they saved us!  Would rate this a 3.5 if I could. If Cajun seafood is your thing, you will appreciate this place so check it out.",

When placing the order, I specifically asked for live crawfish, which I was told is available for $18 per lb versus $9 for the regular flash frozen variety. When picking up my order, the waitress confirmed that these were 'live' for the charged price. No problem! Happy to pay extra for fresh quality.    What I'm not happy about is paying double for mediocre food. Crawfish were definitely frozen with a rubbery bite and bad after taste. I don't think they're even worth the regular price. Will be the last time I order crawfish from this establishment.",

This place started out as the new hot place in the neighborhood, but unfortunately has steadily gone downhill. They used to have great service but now it's meh. All the female staff decided to wear yoga pants. Someone thought it'd be a good idea. Ummmm, nope!  They used to have utensils to crack the shells. Nope. Horseradish for oysters on the half? Nope. Ask twice....nope!  I'm a sucker for the trifecta, and the food is still pretty good but it's definitely gone downhill.",

Many of the cousins ordered crab legs and lobster, I was in a hurry and leaving before everyone so I got me a fried cat fish basket with fries and coleslaw. It wasn't bad at all, typical fried fish and the slaw was ok, but the Cajun fries were amazing. The one constructive criticism k have is they need more tools to cut crabs' legs, they were short and we had to ask for them many times and the answer was they're waiting for others to finish and they'd wash and bring to us. I think they should just have plenty of tools to accommodate everyone.  Would definitely come back here.",

Check. Throw in beer, Mexican Coke and some Fanta and you have quite a party.  And we have rocks, paper and scissors. Really. We had to crack legs, claws and shells. We cut 'em. We cracked 'em. We are doing it all! To get at the meat!  I had a bag of mussels with traditional boil, some potatoes and corn on the cob, medium spice. Hot as hell and I like spicy! The mussels were great.  My wife had lobster. One and a half pound lobster we named Claws all gone. Though when she ripped open the body I didn't really need to see all the internal organs....  My oldest had a full 2.2 pounds of dungenes crab at some super spicy level. He said my mussels were spicier. He liked it. The waiter told him how to open up the shell. Interesting video we now will have forever.   He also had a frogs legs appetizer to start. It was his first and last time because \"the thighs are slimy.\" He did like the breading.  Next oldest had alligator. He liked it, as did all who tried it including our 6 year old. It's how the old saying goes \"it tastes like chicken.\"  Number three had king crab and destroyed it! The ten year old ate her weight in crab! She said it was awesome!  Number four had salmon = boring. He does get one point and $5 for trying alligator.  It was a great messy time and you should try it!",

In April of 2017, we went to the restaurant and one person's meal (salmon over rice) came 15-20 minutes after the other (shrimp bag)   After that experience, we tried the restaurant again recently and faced the same issue. In addition, this time the rice and corn on the salmon meal was ice cold along with the shrimp in the bag being way over cooked.   The redeeming quality, the salmon was fantastic when it came.   Not sure the next time we will give it a chance, but I hope by then it returns to former glory.",

I usually order 1 lb. clams, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $12/lb. and 1 lb. of shrimp, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $10/lb.    The clams are pretty good, but the shell itself is really thick and heavy so you really don't get a lot of clams for 1 lb.    The shrimps are quite large and so tasty with the trifecta sauce.  The do come out super hot, so I always burn my little fingers when I try to peel the shrimp.  Come knowing you're hands will get dirty!  This location also has BBQ.  I tried it before and it's not too bad, but the seafood is why you should come here!",

I could have used better tools besides cheap scissors to crack giant claws. And glad we got here early because the next table tried to order BBQ and they were out.

The 6 of us ordered pounds of shrimp, lobster, King Crab, sausages, corn and fries. All was very delicious and with the trifecta sauce. The only thing that was okay was our batch of oysters which didn't have as much flavor/saltiness but they were ginormous so if you like meaty oysters then you'll enjoy it a bit more. It's a fun messy meal and luckily they provided gloves and bibs. And tons of TVs around for your viewing pleasure. So it's a very loud and festive place and we enjoyed it.",

The atmosphere is fun, family oriented and welcoming. This is a great neighborhood for this type of restaurant you better get there ASAP as soon as they open!",

Upgraded the bag to include corn, potatoes and sausage.  Our server wss extremely attentive and our drinks were constantly refilled.   The one recommendation I have is providing already shelled items for a small fee $5 or so.  I'm low vision and it is a challenge to get all the meat out if the shells.  Plus I'm certain there are others who don't like to do the work themselves.",

WOWERZ! You'll love the service the atmosphere and the food! Oh and almost forgot if you like a little cocktail or beer with your meal it must try the Dixie Peach and/or Abita Beer Purple Haze!

I was torn between the seafood and the BBQ, but ended up going with the soft shell crab \"angry basket\" because Crab is listed before BBQ on the sign on the door. I'm not a HUGE seafood guy in the first place, so the crab was a little fishy for my tastes, but the killer seasoning made up for it. Also comes with a thick, spicy/spiced dip which could have used a little more kick but I know I could have asked for it. Had it with a Grand Canyon Sunset Amber and the total with tip came to just over $20. Not bad! Next time I'll go with the BBQ for comparison.",

We had been here before once and didnt care to write a review because our server 'gigi' seemed super distracted, took time to refill our water cups and  we constantly had to remind her of the things we needed. It was irritating. So we decided to come again and give it a second try. It was 5 of us. Our server Maria was on point with everything! She was friendly, nice and very helpful. You can tell when a server enjoys their job. She was very professional. On top she was very well fluent in Spanish and helped out to explain every single bit of information with my parents! They absolutely loved her. She was able to bring my parents out of their comfort zone with the eating experience.   We had a bit of everything. Started off with some Cajun Fries, ordered a pound Brisket, absolutely delicious!    We also had beers, the purple haze and the kilt lifter. Ordered some shrimp, snow crab, and mussles. All in the trifecta level 3, which is why I wont give the 5th star review, the trifecta level 3 was super spicy. We have had it before but this time was extremely hot. Good thing they have tons of lemons and limes to help out with the spicy.   We definitely had a huge meal.  We wouldn't of had a wonderful time if Maria wasn't there.  So everytime we go now, we will def be requesting for her. She was on top of everything. So thank you to our server Maria for making our parents feel extremely special and giving us all an amazing welcome.   Definitely recommend this place, I will be back.",

I highly recommend this place if you like seafood or Cajun food even a little.  I have not had such perfectly cooked crab ever. As far as spice I recommend the trifecta, but you should be warned that even a level 1 is spicy. They accidentally gave me a level one when I ordered a 2 (my own fault I kept changing things on my order), boy am I happy they made that mistake.  Level 1 was perfect. I can normally handle pretty spicy food but when it comes to seafood I learned that I like to enjoy the flavor without the spice level taking over. I ordered calamari which was really good and snow crab. The snow crab was amazing.  I will absolutely be back...probably later this week. :) Glad I found this gem.",

It came HUGE in a bag steamed perfectly with a nice amount of heat.   The corn on the cob was good and so was my Big Easy Cocktail.  The hubby had the crab and sausage and enjoyed them.

On the downside the food was not only bland, the dungeness crab we ordered was terrible. It was both watery and rubbery which is obviously not what you want in your seafood. The crawfish we ordered (we ordered the fresh version, not flash frozen) was also not good. Nothing was cooked in to flavor the food. It was like something was quickly removed from a boiler and then thrown into a plastic bag with a bunch of goop and shaken up. In addition, the two Po Boys we ordered to go (we love real Po-Boys) were flat out inedible and we got home took a few bites and ended up throwing them away.   After spending $100 and not expecting anything great, we got well below even mediocre and my wife ending up heating up a pizza when we got home. Bottom line, go to this place for the cocktails and bar food, but don't expect real fresh authentic Louisiana style seafood.",

We also added a pound of snow crab with corn, potatoes, and sausage. At their recommendation, we went with the trifecta sauce - mild. It spice level was just perfect. We will definitely be back!",

Our waitress Kina was amazing and really made us feel at home. We were laughing the whole way through. Being extremely indecisive, she ended up picking our meals for us and did an AMAZING job at it.   Food was good but the atmosphere was amazing and Derek, one of the Managers, really took great care of us. Well be back! :)",

We ended up ordering too much food and you can't really \"take cooked shrimp, raw oyster and mussels home\".  The head-on shrimp was a little raw.  I typically love sweet shrimp, but this was a little too slimy for me.  I guess I'm not into the huge portion type places.  Bloody mary was pretty tasty, however.  But I don't think I'll return here.  Not my kind of place.",

Why bring it? He did comp that, though. Why is he a waiter? We are usually huge tippers, maybe the way we look?
