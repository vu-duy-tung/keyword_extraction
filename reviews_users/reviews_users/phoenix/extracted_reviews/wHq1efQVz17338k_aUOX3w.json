    "text": "First off, the best way to get in/find parking is to turn onto 5th Ave. (off McDowell), take the first left (to head closer to 3rd Ave., where Hob Nob's is located). I park in front of any of the houses (obviously without red/yellow/fire hydrants) and have never had a problem finding adequate parking this way even on the nights where my group socials meet up at (50+ people in our group alone).   Tuesdays (at least for now), you can find a $1.95 bottle special (beer/cider) - take advantage of it if you like to partake, it's never been bad stuff and I hate most beers. 5/5 here.  I've had their alcoholic frozen margaritas - or whatever they were - those were good, and their smoothies were nice for my friend after she pierced her tongue. 5/5 here.  Yes, the art is overpriced in most cases, but it's nice to talk about it with your guest(s).  I like the live music they offer sometimes, and the environment/atmosphere. 4/5 here.  Food - I've only ever had their Greek/Mediterranean salad - the chicken was delicious and I enjoyed it. 4/5 here.  Staff: Has always been courteous, remembers my order but not in the \"YOU'RE GETTING THIS AND ONLY THIS\" way but the appreciative way where they actually take the time to get to know you. 5/5 here.",

Ordered the Pesto Pizza sans tomato and it was decent.  I really enjoyed the pesto sauce but the crust was flavorless and the size, well it was disappointing.  $9 for a pie that at most places would be considered their personal pizza size.  It was served on cheap plastic throw away plate and plastic silverware.  I loved the decor inside, beautiful stained glass windows and art from local artists.  The seating left a lot to be desired.  Most of the tables have odd stools with no backs on them and all the \"comfortable\" seating was reserved for tables coming in 2 hours later.  We sat at an aluminum table that had chairs with backs on them but they were super uncomfortable.    Overall I wanted to like this place but I feel it fell flat.  I saw they were up for some nominations for the New Times best of PHX but I guess I am one of those people who just doesn't 'get it.'  Solid 2.5 review but cool interior and the fact they are invested in the locals in the area bumped it to a 3.",

    "text": "My visit to Hob Nobs left me unmoved.  I went on a  Sunday about 1pm.  Traffic was light and Hob Nobs was not busy; less than 10 patrons.  However, it took us ~15 minutes to find  parking.  We didn't realize that Hob Nobs only has about 6 spaces in their lot.  It appears that all other potential patrons must find parking in the neighborhood.  And the big problem with that is 3rd Ave is a one way street; leading TO the restaurant.    We considered going somewhere else decided to figure out the parking.  OK then into the house.  (BTW I generally love restaurants that are located in old houses.)  The interior has some great artwork, and some bad art.  Our table featured some very average -- but overpriced -- photos for sale.   The atmosphere was overall cozy with a variety of seating.    The staff was neither rude nor overly friendly.  They were unenthusiastic.  Customer service seemed to be lacking.  Moreover, the service was slow.  There were only 3 people in front of us but it still took almost 10 minutes to give our orders.  There we only two people working the counter and one was preoccupied with making coffee drinks.  The other was taking orders, doing the register and whatever else.  After giving our order it took another 10 - 15 minutes to get our sandwiches.  In total it seemed like a long wait for deli-style food.  The food is good.  I had the Doc's Choice mesquite turkey sandwich.  It's a little on the small side with one of those overly-thick folds of meat toward the middle; tasty though.  By the time we were into our meal the line at the counter had started to grow quite long.  (Not sure why given the day and time).  One our party wanted an additional bag of chips.  She got up and stood in line for at least 10 minutes to get them.  I probably won't go back.  The food was fine.  However, they appear to be understaffed.  The parking situation was really frustrating.  And once inside the staff were not happy to see us.  They could benefit from an infusion of enthusiasm and some customer service training.",

    "text": "Ever since I moved Downtown, Hob Nobs is one of those places that has been something of a Yelp enigma for me.  Were they trying to be a neighborhood coffee house as they were when this quaint location used to be the Willow House?  Are they trying to be a pizzeria?  A sandwich spot?  A wine bar?  I tried reading several Yelp reviews about the place, but I still couldn't figure it out.  There were also (as I write this) almost no photos of the food or the restaurant itself on Yelp, despite more than 170 reviews.  Huh?  Finally I just decided to give it a shot for dinner on a Saturday evening.  On the southeast corner of 3rd Ave & McDowell, Hob Nobs sits in an old bungalow right between the Roosevelt & Willo neighborhoods.  The first and most obvious observation when you arrive here is that parking is scarce.  Hob Nobs can probably accommodate well over a hundred people at capacity, but has parking for barely a fraction of that.  Fortunately I found a spot this time.  There's a sizable outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside as well (including couches or high tables if that's your preference).  No waiter service here as you go up and order at the front counter and they bring it out to you.  As I alluded to earlier, the menu here is pretty expansive.  They have breakfast and brunch items, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, coffee, beers, wines, mixed drinks, and even baked goods.  Certainly not what you'd expect given the quaint size of the front counter and kitchen.  There were only a small handful of folks in the restaurant so finding time to read the menu and finding a seat were fairly easy this time around.  I decided to go with their four cheese chicken quesadilla for an appetizer & their Secret sandwich (don't ask me why they call it that).  Total for the two items, plus a water and tax came to about $20.  I grabbed a spot in the front dining area facing the fireplace.  So I waited, and I waited, and I waited.  It took just under a half hour from the time I ordered to get my food.  I can forgive a lengthier wait for fresh scratch made food, but if the food took this long with the restaurant not even a quarter full, how long would it take with a full house?  When I got my food at last, neither item looked as I had expected.  Let's start with the quesadilla.  Big enough to share, but no where near the amount of cheese I was expecting.  I could pick up a couple of different cheeses, but honestly the lettuce and tomato (two items I didn't know were going to be in my quesadilla) were the dominant flavors.  As a result, the quesadilla had the consistency of a bland salad moreso than a cheesy filler.  Now the Secret sandwich.  Fruit (grapes and strawberries from what I gathered), and (supposedly) four cheeses on toasted wheat berry bread.  The big secret (apparently) was the side potato salad they provided.  It was fine, but an odd accompaniment for this type of sandwich to be honest.  As for the sandwich?  I've had a number of innovative takes on the classic grilled cheese in my time, but this one also fell woefully short of expectations.  Yet again, where's the cheese?  There were generous chunks of fruit, which is fine.  But barely any cheese that I could make out.  For twenty dollars and more than 20 minutes worth of waiting, I can't say my first experience here was a favorable one.  I have no grudges against the counter staff or the guy who brought my food out to me.  They were more than adequate.  And the aesthetics of the place are pleasant enough that this spot would probably work as a neighborhood haunt to relax, talk, and have a drink.  But as a restaurant, I really feel like Hob Nobs needs to rethink their business model in a big way.  For starters, provide a little more disclosure on your menu about what exactly will be on my plate (this includes both the in house and online menus by the way).  Second, don't try to be good at everything.  Restaurants that try to be good at everything often aren't really good at anything.  My advice?  Trim the menu in half (if not more) focusing only on the greatest hits.  A smaller selection can be great as long as the options available are great ones.  Third, hire wait staff.  If you only want to be a coffee house you can get away with no waiters or waitresses.  When you're a full fledged restaurant serving a huge menu, making customers choose on the fly while standing in line can be dicey.  Having wait staff helps guide customers at their pace.  So now I sort of get why Hob Nobs was always a mystery.  Even after my first experience, much of what Hobs Nobs brings to the table makes me scratch my head.  The options seem enticing enough, but there's really no rhyme or reason to much of the execution.  I'm sure their intentions are good and the folks there seem very nice.  But with the Downtown culinary scene becoming ever more competitive and the choices better than ever, Hob Nobs will need to do some soul searching if they're to thrive in this evolving landscape.",

Pizza was pretty good, with both the sauce and crust done well.   The only sad note - and was more of a sour note, to be specific - was a small live band, where the singer butchered Steely Dan. Sorry, but singing the notes louder does not get them in tune... no reprieve on the following songs....  I'll give them direct feedback on the music and will still recommend them.",

WHen we placed our order,  the waittress/cashier had mistaken our orders and we had to repeat our orders to her,  as she was somehwat confused as to how to apply a coupon to the balance.  We proceeded to sit in the outdoor patio for at least 20 minutes before I had to get up and check on the status of our orders.  By this time we were in a hurry as we were on our 1/2 lunch - that was annoying enough.  What was even more annoying was that all of the parties around us were served before we were and they arrived after we did!  All we ordered was a turkey sandwich and a salmon sandwich,  nothing out of the ordinary.  I had to track the waitress down and literally bring our lunch to the table,  as she was apparently tending to all of the male patrons that were served before we were.  We were the only 2 females in the place, now I know why - apparently they cater to the male clientele in a more timely manner.  Due to poor service,  average food and no parking,  I will not be patronizing this establishment again.",

It was probably the best idea we've had in a while! From the time we walked in the door until we left it was such a lovely experience. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating and helped a friend and I choose something on the menu. It's a seat yourself sort of place, with lots of stools and tables inside or a shaded patio with misters. In general the aesthetic of this place is very home-y, but artistic, without being overpriced. It was the perfect place for a laid back afternoon supper.  They have lots of pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and wines. They also have a lovely dessert case ! In general, a great selection.  I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, and my friend ordered a half sandwich of the same and tortilla soup. The sandwich was delicious! It had slices of chicken instead of chunks, which was something I always appreciate. It came with cheese, pesto, artichoke hearts, red peppers, and tomatoes. It came on toasted bread and came with a little scoop of potato salad. The sandwich was tangy and savory! The potato salad was very light and had a unique blend of flavors. My friend's soup had a lot of flavor without being overwhelmingly spicy. Overall, our dinner was delightful!  We were also drawn by the dessert case. I planned on getting a cookie because they looked so soft, but we ended up with the brownie. And it was the right choice. It was absolutely one of the best brownies I have ever had! It was sticky and fudgy, and had a chewy bottom. It was almost cake like in texture. I highly recommend it!! If you're nice, you might convince them to warm it up and give you a drizzle of caramel and chocolate on top. It was awesome!!  Thanks for the excellent food, experience, and service.  Very good prices for how enjoyable it was.",

Hob Nob's is conveniently close to where we live, but we have stopped going due to consistently bad service.  I get better service at the gas stations in south central Phoenix than I do at this restaurant.  It took well over an hour to get our food (Two sandwiches?).  When I finally approached the cashier about how long our food was taking, I noticed several baskets of food waiting to be dispersed.  The cashier offered a lame excuse about how busy the restaurant was, but there were maybe 10 people inside.    tl;dr version:  The food is good, but the service is consistently terrible.",

It just doesn't feel like someplace I can completely relax.  The espresso was ok- not the best i've ever had, but definitely not the worst. The lemon cake was tasty, but I get the impression that the desserts are not made on site.   The food menu looks good, and the chef assured me that the soup was made fresh every day. Maybe i'll try it for lunch sometime, but I won't be in any hurry to do so. $7.95 for a sandwich with no side better be something special.",

But the greens tasted fresh and there was just enough dressing for my preference. I haven't tried anything else beyond a chai latte which was pretty standard. Some of their pastries look good but I wonder if the muffins are from Costco.   I give this place one star for atmosphere. Each seating area is decorated a little differently. Love the stain glass and the blown-up photos of spots around Phoenix as table decorations. This place really does feel local and one of a kind.",

It was fairly easy to find though parking is a real chore and the signs seem to indicate that only the spaces *directly* beside the coffee shop are for Hob Nobs and that the ones beside the other building are not. Still not sure about that. However, it did also indicate that somewhere on the other side of the road, additional parking existed also.  I didn't have coffee, but I did have a chicken salad with mandarin oranges and pecans that was delish and almost too much for me to eat at one time and on the recommendation of the staff a coconut and lime Italian soda, which was a brilliant and refreshing flavor. Also, thank you. I now have the lime in the coconut song in my head.  Wifi was a definite must and well appreciated and I loved the artwork and decor. The table we sat at was the perfect size for both of us to be on our laptops and eat and work. The music being played was a reminiscent flashback and just at the right level to still enjoy and have a conversation... well until the group of toddlers and tweens arrived. We were soon overcome with tables being pushed together all around us and loud noises. I wish someone would've given us a heads up or informed us a party would be happening. We sadly packed up and headed outdoors to the patio, which ended up being nice.",

However, if you prefer the $5 footlong from Subway, Hob Nobs might not be the place for you. It ain't cheap. But, for the money, you get some really yummy food.  They also have this incredibly tempting dessert case. I gave in and got a cinnamon roll one day and was really happy I did.  The restaurant has free wifi and the password is on each of the tables.

    "text": "Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one \"w\", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the \"closed\" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness.   Feeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.   Let me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call \"a decor.\" They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn?   I ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and \"the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat.\"  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.  I'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled \"Willo House\" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel.   Regardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star! Fingers crossed that they'll relax a bit and make the most of their great location!",

(Given my love of Cibo, I have a soft spot for restaurants housed in historic homes).  Anyways: 2 of my colleagues ordered albacore tuna sandwiches.  I ordered the turkey, bacon, & Gouda sandwich.  Both coworkers bit into their sandwiches and didn't think the tuna was albacore.  Upon further examination, the tuna appeared to be low quality, canned tuna.  Coworker #1 went to inquire about it and she was rudely dismissed. She was not offered an alternative sandwich, really?  My sandwich was equally unimpressive.  Given the lack of customer service and sub-par food, I have no choice but to give this restaurant a low rating.  The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because Coworker #1 really liked the coffee.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",

    "text": "I'm torn regarding Hob Nobs.  I almost wish Yelp had half star ratings (even though that would be a cop-out).  Here's the thing, I felt that Hob Nobs was pretty good, but not quite impressive enough for the full 4 stars.  The building (apparently there's some history to it that I'm unaware if) itself is nicely set up.  I was there on a Sunday to study and try the place out.  I found seating right away, which is sometimes note worthy at places like these.  The setup of the building has it divided into rooms, which is clever.  It allows those in one room to be somewhat separated from the rest of the building.  When you're studying, this can be hugely advantageous.  Eventually, I decided that the coffee just wasn't enough.  It's decent coffee, better than other places I've been.  I ordered their turkey sandwich.  About 5 minutes later, one of the very pleasant staff brought it right to my table.  Minus the silverware, but I suppose you can't have it all.  I was pleased overall.  The turkey and Gouda were sliced to the perfect sandwich thickness.  Everything was fresh but, again, it was good, just not impressively so.  Later on, I realized there was live music playing in the main room.  Since we were so far in the back, it drifted in quietly, unobtrusive.  I really liked that.  I'll probably go back to Hob Nobs eventually.  It's certainly worth at least one visit (I've already recommended it to others as such), but since it's almost 30 minutes from me, I don't know if it's somewhere I'll find myself frequenting often.",

Not all change is bad though and the elbow grease put into it has gone a really long way.  I like the tall tables with adequate laptop space. Living near Roosevelt Row, it's nice to have an alternative to Starbucks' not-free Wi-fi. The spaciousness was also welcome. A dozen people were on laptops and I felt like we all had good elbow/legroom.   My regular coffee was sufficient and the staff I ran into was pleasant.",

My husband was sooo disappointed in his pizza (the Old World \"Spicy\") and jealous of my Smokey Joe and my brother's Pesto Grilled Chicken.  Although the pizza was ok, it did not compare the the layers of flavor and freshness in the sandwiches.  Even our 4 year old loved the Smokey Joe.  She kept commenting on how \"so much good\" it was.  The boys also enjoyed the bottled beer $1.95 special, and I had a hot caramel macchiato (so delicious... there was a hint of cinnamon or hazelnut or something- overwhelming goodness!)  My brother picked up some cookies, which they admit are not made in house, and they were also delicious.  They had more of a cookie DOUGH goodness to them, rather than a baked cookie flavor/texture.  It really worked well.  I overheard one of the girls talking to another patron about the cinnamon rolls and how hard it is for them to keep them on the shelves.  I am hoping the next time we go, we will get to try one.",

I was a vegetarian for awhile and ordered the Veggie Mon.  Now, not a vegetarian and I am still ordering it.  Filling, and you don't feel weighted down going back to work.  Hob Nobs has totally reinvented that Hobbit House.  You can find a room to yourself or sit in the main room.  They have interesting artwork on the walls and under your glass covered table.  Parking is limited but I believe you can park west of the restaurant in the doctor's office parking lot.  I have seen posters for live performances at Hob Nobs but have yet to attend, but good to know.  Outside they do a good job decorating for the seasons.  Pumpkins, reindeer, etc.  Hob Nobs has or had a great front counter barista there named Mikey.  I haven't seen him in awhile but he remembered my name.  He anticipated my order.  He was the man.  He made a connection with all of the customers.  I will try the coffee one day.",

My girlfriend and I decided to give it a whirl today and I wish I could have my $23 back. Yes, $23 for lunch which was 1 salad, 1 sandwich and 2 diet cokes. RIP OFF.   We had the Hob Nob Cob salad which was GROSS. It was seriously a salad you could make better at home - spring lettuce, a tiny sliver of avocado and some turkey meat and sprinkle of bacon DRENCHED in ranch dressing. I really should have taken it back because the amount of dressing made it unedible. I could have rung-out my salad.  Then, we split the Vito sandwich (the Italian one) - again... it was falling apart and the lid on the balsamic jar must have fallen off as they were putting the dressing on our sandwich because it was SOGGY and DRIPPING. Zero presentation.   The only good thing about this place is the ambience.",

I wasn't expecting anything like Willow House, but I was still hoping there would be something worth visiting once and a while taking up their old location. I didn't get that. Instead I got a coffee shop stocked full of pastries from Costco, many staff behind the coffee bar (all with name tag/plates), only disposable utensils and cups made of Styrofoam-type material.  I'm pretty disappointed with the latte I had. They were out of anything smaller than a 16oz cup to put it in, so it ended up being mostly soy foam. It also took a very long time to prepare for such a well (too many?) staffed bar.  I did enjoy the wood floor and the stained glass that was all over.  If you're looking for a quick blah coffee on the run or an over priced pastry or sandwich practically from Costco, than this place is a pretty good bet.  Otherwise I'd pass.",

And the stench of patchouli *still* makes me nauseous. But I was under 21, and coffeehouses were the only places we could nurse a drink for hours and be allowed to hang out.  I had some good times there, made some friends and saw some good bands play our front. Back then, I couldn't help but thing - what would happen if they cleaned this place up?  If they did some basic improvements and made themselves appeal to people with, you know - JOBS? The location is great, the property is great - and the old house has so much character and charm.  It had so much potential - just get rid of the patchouli freaks, raise the bar on food and drink options and the place could be great. Flash forward.  Willo House is dead and gone. And Hob Nob assumed the location. I can't believe it's the same house!  It's - well - CLEAN!  Bathrooms (there are 2 now!) are modern and clean and functional. Walls have been sanded and repainted (no longer fear splinters from resting my hand on a door jam.) They still support local artists, and wares are for sale throughout. The baristas are knowledgeable of the products, efficient and friendly! Thank you, proprietors of Hob Nob - you have brought the vision I had so many years ago to life. Now I know what it could be if the potential were realized - and it is lovely! +100 for the beer and wine license and the great selection of bottled beers - for when I am not in the mood for coffee.",

I stopped into Hob Nobs on my way to Tucson with a colleague who needed a pick-me-up. Having already had my coffee that morning, I tagged along with the intention of leaving empty-handed. That did not happen.  Everything smelled so delicious, and the environment was warm and cozy ... I ordered a chai tea.   While the barista made our drinks, my colleague was chit-chatting with someone else who perhaps was the owner, or at least the manager. \"Waffles?\" she asked me. \"Oatmeal?\" She had a huge grin and was clearly joking with me. The staff member/owner/manager said, \"the oatmeal comes with bananas on top.\"   \"Bananas?\" I asked.   They laughed at me.  \"Well,\" I said, \"If I can take it to go and actually eat it in the car, I'll have some.\"   He made my oatmeal with butter and brown sugar, then topped it with sliced bananas and strawberries. I then added a splurge of half and half.   It was the best oatmeal I have ever had.",

Atmosphere:  Hob Nobs is a chill and comfortable hangout that kind of has that Central Perk feel. Food:  Hob Nobs has a good variety of items on their menu.  I went for lunch and enjoyed the chicken salad while my date said her turkey sandwich was delicious.  The deserts looked great, but we split a cookie so I'll have to go back to try other things and let you know. Energy:  Hob Nobs has a good vibe and super friendly staff.  I will be back, especially since Hob Nobs is light rail convenient.  Not a bad walk from the McDowell station.  Head west on McDowell, Hob Nobs is about a quarter mile on the south side of the street.",

    "text": "Really 2.5 stars:  For no particular reason, I was walking, and walking, and walking.  Hours.  At some point, I realize that I am exhausted and hungry.  Just there is Hob Nob.  Great!  Exactly what I need---just someplace to crash.  At its entirely cute.  Things were totally stacked in their favor---I really wanted to (and still do!) want to like them!  How in the world can this go wrong?    First, there seemed to be like fifty zillion employees tumbling over each other, so disorganized.  (Seriously---there were, what, two customers in the store.  Not sure what the disorganization was about.)  Second, the coffee.  The second they pulled out the cup they were going to put the coffee in, I just knew there would be a problem.  I mean, coffee really does taste better/worse in particular types of cups.  On top of that, the coffee was rather watery.  Okay, food comes.  On a plate that reminds me of big hair and shoulder pads.  But that's being picky.  And, I taste the salad---really quite awesome!!!!  So, I'm now thinking to myself, just don't think of it as a coffee shop, and its really quite likable.  Until I bite into that crouton.  Burnt.  And another one---burnt again!  ......  Seems like this can be a really great place, with some tiny twists.  They have a great base----great atmosphere and the knowledge to make food.  But, until then....  PS: Owners, please don't write to me asking me to come back, etc and rewrite my review.  I hate when owners do that after you've given a less than stellar review.",

I decided to use the option to order pick-up online, but wanted to call to make sure that they had received it. After that, I called no joke, 13 times, and no one picked up. It went straight to voicemail every time.   So, skeptical that I wouldn't have dinner, I drove there anyway. After a few minutes of standing awkwardly at the bar and ready to walk out, I was finally helped by a nice young lady who happened to have my online order ticket in her hand.   The only reason I'm rating this three stars was because that young lady was very nice, and the pizza was good. My husband wasn't impressed and stated that we'll never order such over priced pizza again, but I liked it. My only criticisms are that the red sauce was too acidic and I could not taste the garlic in the garlic ricotta.",

It has a comfort home vibe, but steered to all age groups. I am sure the older generations are use to be waited on, but that doesn't seem to be how this place functions. Definitely recommend giving it a shot before quick judgment and observe how the place works as it is more cafe style like hanging out at a coffee shop or bar.",

    "text": "When my fiance and I were driving home from the dog park, I decided to stop for breakfast at a place I used to frequent and love as a new Arizonan. I have many memories in Hob Nobs with my grad school roommate; we studied there, procrastinated there, and ate a large number of breakfast sandwiches. Since she left I stopped going there so regularly, my old routines changed to new ones. So, when I saw it  coming up on my right, with ample parking, and our two empty stomachs, nostalgia kicked in and all I wanted was the amazing breakfast sandwich I remember from a few years ago. Toasty just sliced sourdough bread, crisp bacon, garlic aioli, fluffy eggs, crisp veggies, all piled high.  Instead, what I got was barely sourdough bread, and a completely incorrect order. I ordered my old usual, and my fiance ordered sausage with cheddar, no onions or lettuce. He got limp, deli sliced turkey, about 1 scrambled egg, cooked to oblivion, barely melted cheddar, and a measly tomato all on the driest, definitely not freshly sliced, sourdough bread. I got crumbled Italian sausage, haphazardly placed sad vegetables, all on the same dry bread. It only took one bite for each of us to know we weren't going to eat these sandwiches.  We do have a very happy, very full dog, though.  This is how you lose customers. There are so many good spots in Phoenix now, I'm not sure I will risk going to Hob Nobs again.",

The artichoke dip was so spicy it gave one of our crew the hiccups.  Be warned...   When the bill came, the owner, Bob, could not figure out how to split it... no big deal.  What was odd is that he hovered over us while we figured out the split and tip.    So much odd about this place.  I had a negative experience once before, and swore I would not return.

He made a delusions white mocha and was very helpful with the menu.  Get the smokey joe!  Smoked Gouda and turkey on wheat berry bread! So fresh. So tasty. I also got a veggie mon,  it was a great veggie sand w black bean hummus that really made that sandwich stand out.  It wasn't as tasty as the turkey... I think mostly bc it needed more veggies like cucumber and an extra tomato slice or something. Olives are a potent flavor that needed a little more balance. But just a small suggestion for a great coffee/sand which shop.  Def coming back for more!!",

    "text": "My sister really liked this place, but for me, it was disappointing.   My sister had the 1/2 sandwich and soup, which was the Doc's Choice sandwich on sourdough. I should say that I teased her about the half sandwich thing. I find ordering half sandwiches rediculous when you can have a whole sandwich instead, but whatevs. Her sandwhich was decebt. Nothing special, though. I forgot what the soup she ordered was, but it tasted like chicken and rice but with lots of lemon. I actually really liked her soup. It was good and hot. On the day we went, it was raining, so it was perfect.   I, however, did not like my food. I ordered the Smokey Joe sandwich and a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar Soup. My soup was barely warm. I love soups, and it's hard to mess it up when its not made from scratch unless you burn it or serve it cold. The sandiwich had way too much Mustard. WAY too much. I couldn't really taste anything other than the mustard. It (I kid you not) dripped mustard. But, this being the first meal of my say at 4 p.m., I ate HALF of my sabdwich exept the crust because it was only mustard and bread. And I finished my cold soup. My sister did point out my hypocrisy about my whole Half-sandwich rant. It was somewhat embarrassing.   Now, I'd like y'all to know that I'm known to practically lick my plate clean. I eat a lot. Anything. And just about everything. If I can't finish my food for whatever reason, I get it to go because I will finish it as soon as I get home . I left that sandwich, though, and never want to eat, see, or smell Dijon mustard again.",

But when we did get it, it was tasty. Good flavors in both the sandwich and the soup. I just had to eat around the tomato chunks.

Being there Didn't  seem like a restaurant, more like hanging out at a friends house. It's very comfortable .  I ordered a roast beef sandwich. It was easily the best sandwich that I have had in a very long time! I was also able to enjoy a brownie. The brownie was great! Not too sweet or heavy, just right!

These two things alone will lure us into almost anywhere. Upon arrival, their menu said they had over 30 craft beers which wasn't as advertised but obviously should be plenty to choose from. We chose a Bbq pizza and traditional spicy pizza from the menu. The girl working the register seemed preoccupied and also had a broken arm so she couldn't do much along the lines of serving or bartending and was the only person working front of house. When we asked for a beer list she said, \"you just kind of look at the taps and bottles\". They had maybe 4 beers on draft. The pizza was soggy and cold. They were understaffed and didn't deliver on the food or beer. The only thing that saved this place was the jazz band playing. I also had a glass of their Pinot that I enjoyed. For music and wine, I'd go. For everything else, I'd opt out.",

By the way, their was plenty of space. I understand if it was packed and need more tables inside, but he could of at least been nicer about it all.   Not sure if they changed management but it's no good lately. Honestly the food is over priced for what it is, and the music at times is way too loud for the place.",

    "text": "This place is super cute. An historic home converted into a bar/coffee shop/cafe/live music venue.   They have a surprising large bottled beer selection including a lot of microbrews. This past Sunday they had a beer of the day for only $2, not sure if that is an every day event, but it was a great deal. When the cashier told me she was out of the beer of the day, she said I could substitute for any other beer for the same price - sweet!  Service was very friendly, so whatever problems they may have had in the past they seem to have fixed (or fired!) The seating is cosy, albeit limited. The patio is a nice touch when the weather cooperates. There is artwork for sale on the walls, but struggling artists won't be struggling for long if they sell them at those prices! The problem is, they probably won't sell because of the prices, so the artists will remain struggling.  The menu leans to the healthy side, but not to the extent of chickpea and cardboard burgers at Pita Jungle (thank god!). I think they call the sandwiches \"Artisan\" which is apt. The portions are big and the prices reasonable. I had the Smokey Joe on my last visit and a Reuben the previous time. I think the Reuben was the sandwich of the day, didn't see it on the regular menu this time. Both sandwiches were great.   The only negative is the parking. There is a little parking lot behind Hob Nobs, but because 3rd Ave is a one way street going the opposite way from McDowell, you will have to navigate around the neighbourhood a little before you find it. Then you'll find it to be full and you will curse Phoenix's one way streets and drive around the neighbourhood one more time to try and find street parking. It's worth the hassle though.",

It was very sweet and my friend was quite surprised and touched.   Today they had a kale salad as a special. It was absolutely delicious with the combination of kale, candied walnuts, grapes, avocado, and poppy seed dressing. In addition to sharing the kale salad, my friend and I also shared the albacore tuna salad sandwich on marble rye. The tuna had a lot of flavor and matched perfectly with the marble rye bread.

    "text": "It was a Sunday morning, and I looked out my hotel room and thought \"WTF?  Rain actually falls in Arizona?\"  Regardless, I showered and headed out the door, because damn it, I needed some coffee.  After getting off on the 7th street exit for the 30th time while out in Phoenix, Google Maps led me to Hob Nobs Coffee, where I decided to go based on the odd name, and the fact that it was nearby when I found out that Coffee Conspiracy or Conspire or whatever the eff it was called at the time conspired to be closed despite listing as open online.  Best thing that could have happened to a traveler who just wanted a good cup of coffee.  Conveniently located off of McDowell, I was fortunate to find a parking spot in their tiny on-site parking lot.  Upon going into the establishment, I'm at first puzzled by the odd layout, and how it feels kind of like a vestibule upon entrance, but the pretty face behind a counter leads me to where I wanted to be.    While waiting for my morning mocha to be prepared, I walk around the establishment, looking at all the local artists' contributions and works for sale on the walls and behind displays.  I can appreciate such a venue for display.  My drink is warm and tasty, and serving it to me is an attractive lass whom fancied my eye, and makes me favor places that have pretty girls working there.  But the place as a whole is relaxed and comfortable, and had the most wonderful sofa chairs in the world.  If I lived in the area, I'd say it would be a fantastic place to gather or meet up at, or to have a quaint breakfast, or as in my case a great place to get a morning cup of coffee.  With prices that are about the norm as any other coffee shop, it's up to the atmosphere and decor to draw a customer, and with that in mind, I rank Hob Nob highly amongst the many coffee shops I stopped by while out in Phoenix.",

Done with this place.",

    "text": "I am obsessed with Hob Nobs breakfast pizza and the crack potatoes they serve as a side. My husband orders the build your own omelet and always really enjoys it (even though I eat his potatoes). This most recent time he ordered the waffle with cinnamon sugar apples on top and he enjoyed it (mentioned he would skip the whip cream next time). We opt for the bottomless mimosas and depending on who serves it they are either super weak or very generous. I appreciate that I don't have to wait until 10-11 on a Saturday to eat breakfast/brunch in central Phoenix and Hob Nob has a very warm and welcoming family feel.  They offer a full bar, a great case of pastries, and a delicious menu! If you haven't checked it out put this on the top of your list.",

And occasionally I enjoy their omelet bar which is fantastic.  Today, I ordered my coffee and was told the price was $4 and change.  This is more than I've ever paid so I asked if the price had gone up.  The counter person told me it was .75 for the cream in my coffee.  What? She was very nice. And very apologetic.  The person in line behind me said that he never tips at Hob Nobs with his credit card because the servers don't see the money.  I don't know if this is True, but  I can believe that any place that charges .75 for cream In Your coffee would do that too.   I'm very disappointed and won't be back.",

When we came in the gentleman behind the counter let us know that it was counter service and then have a seat. No problem. We ordered and proceeded to sit outside. The seating was a bit odd and mismatched, somewhat uncomfortable. The noise from McDowell made it hard to have a conversation. After about 30 minutes, a man came out and asked if we had ordered the tamponade. We said no. He said, \"well you can have this, it must have been extra.\" We let him know, by description, the two sandwiches we were waiting for. 10 minutes later a woman came out and put them in front of us without apology or letting us know what she was leaving.   The food was okay, but not good enough to overlook poor service and a 40 minute wait.   I went to the restaurant website and sent an email in hopes that it was a \"one off\" day and would have appreciated some feedback. None came. As I said, I really wanted to like a local neighborhood cafe but can not recommend at this time. The search continues.",

We were the only customers there (not surprising since it was about 7 am on a Saturday) but saw that they were preparing for their omelette bar. Wish we would've gone later to try that but maybe next time.  The staff was super friendly and the gentleman at the counter made you feel right at home. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and added avocado and their garlic aioli. So glad I did! Their garlic aioli was delicious and added so much flavor to the sandwich!! I would definitely recommend trying it. Their pizzas looked delicious also but at 7 am, I was not ready for pizza. I plan on going back and enjoying their live music and pizza at a later time in the day :).",

Each time I've gone, no complaints/ food is always delicious. To me, if you blended your home with a cafe, a bakery, diner and pub, you'd have Hob Nobs. The only minus I can think of is their parking situation. It's very limited but there are places to park across the street.",

It reminds me of a cute cottage turned into a cafe/bar. We showed up at 9:04....which was 4 minutes after their kitchen closed but the lovely woman behind the bar made sure to stop the kitchen staff so we could eat. I am eternally grateful.   I ordered the shrimp po' boy. It had more than enough shrimp with a delicious sauce with a bit of a kick. It came with a slice of watermelon!! I loved that. They have beer on tap and several wines to choose from as well.   If you've read any of my reviews, you know the most important thing to me is dog friendly... so yes they get this star! They have a patio for dogs and brought out water for my dog. On my way out, they gave us some yummy treats to make sure my dog was fat and happy.  You know they say dogs are just like their owners.",

The white cheddar cheese, thinly sliced sirloin and that roasted garlic aioli on top of their focaccia bread was soooo good. The mix of Dijon mustard and garlic aioli gave this sandwich a nice kick.  I ordered the Voodoo Chicken Salad, which was made by the lady who greeted me. Very good as well and provided a slight spice. The salad is served with their Roquefort dressing so if you aren't into this, they also have ranch. To be honest though, I didn't need but only a little dressing.  Definitely, give this place a try. While I didn't drink, they do have a bar. They also serve breakfast, which I'm sure is yummy too.",

    "text": "Here's what I want. I want a coffee shop where I can do my work in a peaceful and cozy setting without sitting on top of the person next to me and I'd love to have the option of a good sandwich if I happen to stay during lunch hour. I think I found that at Hob Nobs.    After driving by Hob Nobs too many times over the years, I finally made my way inside through the adorable patio surrounding a quaint historic house. The moment I stepped inside, it felt like I had stepped into a welcoming home. The warm wooden floors complimented the historic banisters and the house had the old feeling to it without smelling old. That's a plus and sometimes hard to find in an old house.   I looked around and saw plenty of seating options including several tables and chairs on the patio and several all throughout the house, including a converted sun room in the front. But personally, my favorite area was the living room with a worn in leather couch and two leather chairs looking at the fireplace still decorated with Christmas attire.   The staff warmly greeted me and I asked the lady what she normally likes. She pointed me in the direction of the Smokey Joe -- Gouda, turkey and tomato on white bread. I opted out of the Dijon and added in honey mustard and it was definitely a tasty treat! The bread was toasted and the turkey was warm and freshly roasted. The honey mustard with sweet and creamy all in one. It came with a pickle and small cup of fruit. The meal itself wasn't on the cheap end ... more like middle of the road expensive...about $10 for a sandwich and drink. However, I think it's definitely worth it if you are looking for a place to set up shop for awhile and this is definitely a cozy spot. Awhile later, I needed a caffeine boost to get me through part two of the day, so I went the iced coffee route. They have a huge assortment of syrups and the coffee is freshly roasted and tasty. It was just $2 for a 16 oz cup of coffee which isn't bad in my book! So, while the sandwiches might be a bit on the pricier end, the coffee is spot on reasonably priced. Plus on the sandwich end, the ingredients are so fresh, I'd rather pay a bit more for the oven turkey like I had.   So whether it's warm or cool weather, Hob Nobs is an excellent option for a True coffee house experience...they even have life music some nights!",

I hadn't been here since the place was Willow House and was mostly decorated with dirty hippies. I approve of the change. Let's sample the wares, shall we?  OK so first of all, the coffee is weak. Tastes like mom's coffee. Maybe that's your thing, it's not mine. Second, when I am asked if I want \"room for cream,\" and I say \"yes,\" I am not giving you the green light to put in what you figure is an appropriate amount of cream. Seriously did this just happen? Yep, it sure did. Oh, and it was too much freaking cream - shocking, right? Why would anyone do this? People's idea of what the right amount of cream is simply *has* to vary too much for anyone to think this is a good idea. So yeah. Boo.  It's too bad the place bills itself as a \"coffee house,\" because the sandwich I had (\"Vito's\" - the Italian one) made up for the coffee disaster. WOW. This was a GREAT sandwich. The bread tasted like it came from the Willo bakery down the street if the Willo bakery had ever made bread that was anything approaching edible, which it never has so I don't know why I even said that. The bread was a ciabatta type bread, lush, moist and delicious. The sandwich was overstuffed to the breaking point with meats and cheeses and had a delicious Italian dressing to top it off. The kalamata olives were a nice touch. Voted A+++ - would eat sandwich again!  All in all, I'd gladly go back. For the food. The coffee? Not so much. Maybe if you're the \"half caf double decaf caf with whipped cream and a shot of Bolivian Espresso\" type the place is like indie Starbucks heaven, I don't know. I'm the coffee type. With a bit of cream, which I am given to understand is actually weirder these days than the half caffers. WHATEVER",

If you can't do a cappuccino right you have no business being in the coffee business. In addition, it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese(over 15min). A wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time. Am I wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house. I had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it. The bagel was fine, but its not as though they are baking them in the back. Save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter.",

There was live music playing, and the staff was super friendly-and helped us pick out some really yummy lemon cake and nut free brownie.  So delicious and my white chocolate mocha was great. The ambiance is unlike anything I've seen in AZ-it had a real, authentic, coffee house setting ( I hate comparing everything to back East, but it's all I got to compare it to people)..but it does feel like a super cool, Montclair NJ sort of joint. (shout out to NJ). Anyway..tons of local art on display and I was amazed at all the seating (inside and out). Loved it! My local place, True Brew is my fave, but this is a perfect spot for a late night treat on a weekend.",

    "text": "Okay, I've never seen this place before and I was only in the area to attend a planning meeting for the 2011 Phoenix Film Festival, and just stumbled across it. It looked like one of those cool renovated houses and I saw that this weekend they were grilling locally made dogs, of various types on the patio. Being someone who can never pass up trying a new hot dog place, I stopped in.  Well let me tell you...wow....what a beautiful place. It is all dark hardwood inside with tables throughout various rooms, and these beautiful stained glass windows in the back. It reminds me of some places I visited in Denver, Colorado but I never expected to find a place like it in Phoenix. I did notice that they sell a number of various sandwiches and some wickedly awesome looking pastries (trying to avoid sugar so I could only look, not taste), but I was there for the dogs...and I was not to be deterred in my mission. I found out that they had several different types of sausages with one being a chicken tequila and lime sausage which, being overweight and middle aged, I thought was the safest choice for my cardiovascular system. I got an iced tea along with it and then they gave me a basket with a bun in it and told me to take it outside to the grill.  There are three or four patio tables outside with some shade (it was rather sunny today...as is most days in Phoenix) and they were still setting up and prepping the hot water baths for the various dogs. As part of the process they have a flat grill that goes on top of the regular one and they were grilling up a whole mess of green peppers and onions. I had the good fortune to meet one of the owners of the establishment and learned this place used to be the Willow house before they took it over (never been there but I understand people liked it quite a bit).   Well, to get to the food, the chicken sausage, I found out, is made by the family that owns it, special family recipe and it was sooooo good. I had it with brown mustard and sauerkraut and the owner even grilled the bun, it was wonderful. It would be nice to maybe have a side of chips as well but otherwise perfect.  So, the grilled dogs are wonderful but I think this will be a great spot for my Sunday morning ritual of coffee drinking and reading the Sunday NYT. I found they open at 7 am on the weekends so I'll be there bright and early to grab my spot and enjoy the sort of coffee house atmosphere that is not all that easy to find here in Phoenix...hope to see you there! :-)",

Nothing like have a pizza and latte delivered... with minimum purchase there is no fee for delivery. Knocks the heck out of Pizza Hut/Dominos...  Staff is super-friendly and the music is hit or miss but if you can, give it a go. Short walk from Central/McDowell light rail.  But, no cupcakes. How sad is that?",

    "text": "Not sure what to give this place. Went in for breakfast with two friends this Saturday. Menu for breakfast is very limited to steel cut oatmeal, quiche and a breakfaast sandwhich. We each had the breakfast sandwhich on different breads with different cheese, meat and toppings.  I asked for my bread to be buttered but it was not so I got cold butter from the kitchen to spread on my basically cold sandwhich that had just arrived. They also season the eggs without telling you with some herbs that turned out to taste ok but looked questionable. Two of us had ice tea, which was very weak and one had coffee but I no idea what he thought of it since he didn't have any more.  One of the cooks brought out a fresh baked blueberry scone as an apology for sending out a less than perfect breakfast.  Hmmm makes me wonder if he knew our food was damn near cold?   The scone was large and delicious. Actually all the bake goods looked very good on display.   The place is very charming and it even has outside seating which is nice.  But the bill was $26 for cold breads with cold eggs and a small meat portion that if you didn't look for it one would miss.  So I give the place 2 stars. Earned by a good scone, a cute building and a kind gester of the staff.  But I wasn't impressed enough to return.  Oh yeah I found a hair on my egg but I'm hoping it was my own. But as I think about it now It probably was not mine as I read others review. Ewwwww  Also the lunch menu does not appeal to me.  And many would agree that the presentation is lacking and the price is on the high side. And while serving beer upsets another yelper because she will not study there because of it now. I don't think it has hurt the business and I'm sure their limited seating does not encourage people to dwell for hours anyhow. Oh and parking is very limited also another reason one might not linger for hours.",

Lost a star for two reasons: 1)they pour the cream for you. I didn't realize this and would have specified skim milk ahead of time, but instead watched a big glug of half-and-half go into my husband's coffee. They were very accommodating and made me a new one, but I would still like to be able to doctor my coffee myself.   2)The music is a radio station, complete with annoying, repetitive GreatClips ads (Men's haircuts just $7.99!!!). Come on, just plug in an iPod and play some constant music. No one wants to listen to radio ads while chilling at the coffee house.   Coffee was fine. The food looked good; people have complained about the prices, but why are you going to a coffee place for food? It was maybe a dollar on the pricey side, I guess.   I have no problem with the presence of beer, but what with the beer and the gigantic PIZZA banner out front, it makes me wonder if Hob Nobs is struggling with identity. Pick one and go with it, please.   Overall a pleasant experience; just a few glitches.",

Staff is mildly inept, reminiscent of a drugged out college campus coffee shop, and the patrons range from crunchy granola wannabe to self righteous thespian. The food is fine, nothing spectacular but worth the price. The beer selection is wonderful, especially for a cafe in phoenix, but the staff doesn't seem to know the difference between a beer other than color. the cashier proceeded to tell my wife, a veteran, that someone always asks vets how many people they killed, though advised to be careful so they don't freak out and blow the place up. Quaint. Offensive. Not even environmentally friendly. Also, we almost got attacked by a dog on our way in. The only reason I'd come back would be to chuckle at actresses boasting about performances and geeky kids insisting complete strangers look EXACTLY like a younger, wiser Jerry Garcia. If your a lost, self conscious liberal unsure of safe places in a big republican state, look no further. Otherwise, don't waste your time, head down the street to Sun Up brewery.",

    "text": "I am part of a group that meets once a week in the evenings.  The staff was very welcoming to us, and even stays open an hour later for us so that our fairly large group has access to food, drinks, and restrooms.  As far as customer service goes, it just doesn't get better than that.   It also helps that the staff is welcoming, friendly, cheerful, and fun to interact with.   As for the food, I've never tried anything there I didn't like, and I never hear complaints from anyone in my group about what they order.  In fact, usually, everyone's food looks so good that people who weren't planning on eating anything end up ordering something they saw someone else munching on and it just looked too yummy to resist.   I've had: the caprese salad, the shrimp & white sauce pizza, the pepperoni pizza, their sugar-free pumpkin cupcakes, their brownies (heated up with whipped cream and drizzled with caramel sauce-to die for), various cookies and pastries, their coffee... all of it is stellar.  They also, amazingly enough, have a PHENOMENAL selection of beers.  All kinds, and they even have a $1.95 bottled beer of the day special every day.  Usually this prompts me to try something I've never had before, and being a beer fan, this just tickles me pink.  The times I've been there, all but once their daily selection was something new to me, and not a typical beer.  Of course, one time, their beer of the day was Bud Lite, which I passed on.    They also have harder liquors, and several specialty beers on tap, not to mention wines by the bottle or glass.   Prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food you're getting.  I can't say enough good things about this place.",

Yesterday at the recommendation of an employee I got the Doc's sandwich - I can't remember the exact name and it's not listed online, but she was so right.  It's mesquite smoked turkey, spicy aioli, peporoncini, onions, on this outstanding pretzel bread, toasted. Just the right amount of zing to it, though it had a bit more aioli than I would have cared for. It's slightly pricey at 8.95, though it comes with a (small) side of fruit. The first time there I got the Smokey Joe (mesquite smoked turkey breast, smoked gouda, lettuce, onion, tomato & cilantro with garlic aioli - w/o bacon for me) - also very good.  Next time I go I'll have to try the coffee, and they do have a surprisingly large selection of bottled beer.  I really like what the owners did with the old Willow House, which I used to go to back in the day. When I first went to Hob Nobs I was kind of sad to see the old place change, but they did such a great job with the renovation that it's hard to complain.   As others have noted, the parking is very tight; I've gotten lucky, but I'm pretty sure there's a sign that says you can park across the street.  (By the way, for some reason Yelp has separate listings for \"Hob Nobs\" and \"Hob Nobs Coffee House. Not sure why.)",

They also have tempting looking desserts, but I've never partaken. Lovely comfy cozy rooms with ample light, a main room with overstuffed chairs & sofa, others with wooden chairs, even a picnic style, & all with delightful artwork & handmade crafts - for sale. Nouveau riche boutique, pricey but nice. They also have umbrella shaded tables outside. Live acoustic music some evenings otherwise fairly quiet as rooms are sectioned off like a home with the glass counter where you place your order at the heart. The only downside is the parking is scarce. Very. As there have been too many times I really wanted to stop in, but could find nowhere near enough to park, I haven't been as much. In fact it's been a while but good enough an experience I wanted to share my more positive memories.",

    "text": "Hob Nobs Coffee House is in this quaint little old house on McDowell not far from the downtown area.  Upon entering I wasn't clear as to if I was in a coffee house or a trendy gift shop with art for sale everywhere you looked.  I also did not experience the aroma of freshly brewed coffee as I walked in but I was greeted by a very friendly person behind their counter that offered to make me a cup of joe.  Their coffee was congenial and pleasant.  They had a limited amount of the normal coffee house accompaniments ~ a few pastries and cookies~ to coffee.  They seemed to be more of a cafe or dinner based on what they are offering their customers.  Pizza at a coffee house?  Now that's different...    They have a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches and wraps.  Salads and a few breakfast and bunch options as well.    It was very difficult to get as comfy as I do in most coffee houses, but then again I'm not sure this is really a coffee house but more of a cafe \"slash\" gift shop.  Nothing against the owners and I don't blame them for trying to maximize their revenues through additional avenues other than coffee.  But you might consider changing your name to Hob Nobs Cafe and gift shop?  This is a cool place to meet people for lunch you don't know.    Hear me out ~ Their tables and chairs are not very comfy so it makes it easier for you to end your conversation.  This can be a good thing you know : -)",

There are a variety of soft drinks and juices on the refrigerators for those that don't drink coffee but we all know everyone drinks coffee!  They offer some craft beers with a respectable selection.  Oh yeah and they have wines but for some reason they are hidden away.    There are several great sandwiches I can recommend but the Vito's Favorite is definitely my pick (minus the mustard they don't mention on the menu).  Another one you will not really care about but if you like Oatmeal try their irish blend which is my favorite with some expresso.  Lastly, Parking is tight behind the building but Parking is available across the street.",

    "text": "This place has absolutely no soul. It's that sterile museum-like type of place where you feel like you can't touch anything. Not the kind of environment for a coffee house in what used to be a pillar to the Phoenix Art and Music Scene. I don't care how dingy and mismanaged the former Willow House became. When it came down to it, it was still one of the best things Phoenix had to offer it's counter-cultural artsy citizens. The former Willow House may not have been as spruced up as a place Hob Nobs is today, but the food was better, the service was more genuine, and the events there were fantastic. Poets had their own night, Musicians had their own open mic that drew in some of the best local talent Phoenix has today, and so on...Now...it's all just a fading memory.   Simply put, Hob Nobs has inferior baristas, the art is disgustingly main-stream/mass-market looking, and the live music they have there is so bad, Starbucks wouldn't even play it. Their prices are too high for mediocre food, and don't even get me started on their baked goods. To the people who think the art is gorgeous... have you never walked into ANY of the dozens of REAL art galleries in Phoenix? Also, I'm no interior designer, but leather seats and high wooden pub tables in one room and chrome and glass w/ a flat-screen TV in another doesn't seem like the place I'd like to be in. One star for the bathroom upgrade, but I guess it doesn't matter since they shit all over the place anyway.  PS. I'm not just saying all of this as a blind Willow House loyalist-- if you look through my reviews, I frequent most of the coffee shops all around town and this one is just a huge rip-off.  OH, and they have permission to sell beer now...which is probably because their coffee sucks so bad, no reasonable sober person could possibly want any.",

He's not friendly, never smiles, and always acts as if we are troubling him, and has twice forgotten part of our order. The older woman is awesome so if you go there, do your best to avoid the guy - he has black hair and wears glasses.

However, all appeared to be well when, after a quick check behind the bar, the staff member suggested a nice pineapple cider. Sure thing! I don't know why it was on the chalkboard then but, whatever, I thought.  But then what arrives at my table after we were seated but a warm pear cider in a pint glass. Seriously, it was flat and had obviously been poured from a bottle that couldn't have gone in the refrigerator five minutes ago. It was the impression that I couldn't shake the rest of our meal (a warm pineapple cider can only improve a salad and pizza so much), though both the pizza and salad were good.   I really expected more from this place. Maybe I need to give them a shot when it's cold and just go with some coffee. It had to be an anomaly that service was that so poor that day.",

This set the bar so high that we are now afraid everything else will seem insignificant in comparison. It is a little \"mom and pop\" shop - the owners were amazing. Extremely helpful and even gave us tips for our trip in Arizona. The food was superb. They even have coffee flavored beer!

Other than the wait, this place was very yummy and I would recommend the food to anyone.",

    "text": "The food that I finally received there was okay, but we had to eat so quickly we could not enjoy it. Myself and a friend went there for lunch and got there at around 11:20 am. We were there before most people would go there and believing we would beat the crowds. We went in and found that you could sit wherever you like but had to order up at the front. So we went up to order, I asked for the voodoo chicken salad which is one of their Specialties, and was informed they don't have that. Then I looked over the menu while my friend ordered, asked if they were out of chicken and was told no, wasn't real thrilled with what I saw, but I finally thought I'll try the Plantation chicken salad. They were out of that one too. Again, we were there before any crowds had hit. Finally, I ordered the Greek salad, with chicken. Then I sat down and waited for the food. My friend also ordered a salad, the cobb salad. We waited for over 45 minutes to receive our food. I had gone up once and asked where were the food was as we were on a lunch hour and needed to be able to have time to eat. They said they had catering and other phone orders that came in, so they were really backed up. If you are getting that much business from outside, why don't you lock the doors and keep people from coming in? Why would you not tell the people it's going to be a little while for their food? We were not told this when we came in. When we finally got our food, as I said above, we had to Wolf it down. What a very unpleasant experience, I still have to call them as they didn't even put the chicken on my salad, and they charge me for it. With the way we were treated there and with the way that was run, I will not go there again nor will I recommend this to anybody.",

More sauce would've been perfect but I didn't ask for more. I would totally order the sandwich again but ask for the fish to not be as cooked as it was; a few more minutes of heat and it would've been chewy. This is a perfect spot to study, write, read, and relax over some good food and tasty beer. Check it out!",

Don't park across the street in the vacant lot, unless you want to be towed, not from Hob Nobs but his annoying neighbor! Now on to the food! I think the sandwiches are top notch here! Doc's Choice is ONE of my favorites! This sandwich is full of mouth watering bits!! Every bite you take is worth the 8.95 you pay for it! And it is served on a Preztel Roll that will knock your socks off! Another favorite is The Smokey Joe, all of their aioli's they make really make all of their sandwiches pop here! Not only are lunches great but the bakery items are amazing as well! All the cookies cakes and muffins are delish!! The staff is a very friendly family always nice and willing to help you out from odering to free refills! Give them a try! Really nice Mom and Pop place with excellent food! Very cute and comfortable! I love coming in around Halloween as the owners go all out and decorate it!!",

There is handmade art on the walls (some much better than others). It does have an odd layout with many different room/levels, which again is a part of the aforementioned charm.  The food/drinks did not blow me away, so I have not been back there since, but I would be willing to give this place another shot, especially since they just put up a new shade-providing gazebo on the patio, something they desperately needed. Once the weather cools down I start loving quirky little places like this again :)",

    "text": "Having never visited Hob Nob's previous incarnation -- The Willow House -- I cannot compare the two. However, from what I've experienced in comparison to what others have written about The Willow House, Hob Nobs is da' bomb. (Okay, I know what I just wrote is really cheesy, but I just had to -- I can't pass up an opportunity to flex my rhyming muscles!)   The place, for some reason, reminds me of the coffeehouse from Frasier. I think it is the dark wood, craftsman style bungalow feel. Very reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest, especially Seattle. I really like that warm and cozy vibe, and Hob Nobs pretty much has that covered. They kept the look and feel of the place like an actual home. There is a living room area with a more formal feel, a nice sitting area with leather couches and chairs around a fireplace, and then some nooks and crannies in the back for those wanting a more intimate and secluded setting.  As far as the coffee, I'm not much of a connoisseur of the stuff, but it was okay.  Nothing really special -- I have had better -- but it was decent. They've got other stuff too -- pastries, sandwiches and yummy chocolates from a company called Belle Fleur Chocolate.   The other nice touch is their live music offerings. A friend played there the other night, and despite the sound being a little so, so (not sure if it was his amp or theirs) it was a lovely setting for hearing some local and visiting musicians perform their stuff. I'm always on the lookout for cool places to hear up-and-coming singer/songwriters, and this is one more place I can put on my list, as well as enjoy a cool, cozy and creative atmosphere.",

I couldn't wait to bring her here as my previous experiences were stellar and atmosphere so quaint and fun. What a fiasco. On the evening of April 23rd were decided to drop in for a beverage and dessert.  Parking was horrible and included a car taking to two spots. When we finally found parking, we went inside to a somewhat busy crowd, maybe 20 people.  We were never greeted.  Not one employee even acknowledged our existence.  We stood around for a bit and then sat, waiting for someone to offer assistance.  About 10 people came in after us, all being greeted and told someone would be right with them.  Orders were taken and served and there we sat, waiting. We left.  No beverages or dessert.  Will never be back.",

    "text": "CHARMING!  This is a very cute little cottage with delicious food.  When u walk in u feel like u are entering the home of the seven dwarves, so cute.  Then one of the first things u see is a glass case with gigantic beautiful pastries.  Keep going and u will see a bar with a very detailed display of all the beers and IPAs they have to offer.  I chose to sit at the bar always assuming I will get quicker and better service with some \"in yo face\".  I was greeted by a sweet and eccentric lady who was happy to talk about all of their daily specials and what is brought in locally.  She had her coffee cup and was just chillin out, thankful that she wasn't stuck out in the cold rainy day.  I decided for the Thursday sandwich choice - Docs.  It was served on a toasty pretzel bun and had some peppers and creamy delish sauce paired with a beautiful green salad with tomatoes and cucumbers.  I could see the chefs in the kitchen preparing my order and I was impressed with the time and care they put into each little detail.   This is not the place u want to go when u are in a rush or need to get back to work in a jif.  It seems like they are on their own mellow clock but that's cool if u have the time to spare.  It was comfy and yummy.",

I particularly like the bruschetta (have ordered a few times), salmon sandwich, and the chicken pesto sandwich. Haven't tried the pizza yet, but heard it's good. The caprese skewers were a bit disappointing for $7-super small serving. I like this place for its unique and quirky atmosphere, and friendly atmosphere.",

It doesn't stop there though! The coffee is amazing!!! I'm serious!! And so is the food.   I didn't think it was fair to keep this place to myself any longer so I took my gf there for Valentine's Day and she was so delighted with it. I took her to a very similar looking restaurant for our first date, so she kept reminiscing on it. I got the pesto chicken sandwich again, AND it was even better than I remembered it! She got the pizza and loved it! Also they have a extensive list of beer, so bee enthusiasts please go!   The only complaints is the limited parking area and then paying at the counter. BUT everything else surely makes up for it!!",

I had the Docs Choice as a wrap and I can't say enough good things about it. Other co-workers ordered the Smokey Joe, avocado pizza, and the cobb salad. Everything was so delicious.

One day my subordinates, and a speech therapist and myself was driving around looking for lunch after an intensely boring training for work.....after 12 minutes of driving we stumble upon this place.  We were very sceptical about this place at first, but we are adventurers and adventurers don't back down from an opportunity and decided to give this place a shot.   The food was excellent for the price, The place was very clean and very homey, since it was probably a house way back when.  The place was well lite and decorated and was just very inviting.  The staffs were super friendly, even when they screwed up one of our orders they promptly fixed it and let us keep the wrong order for free and lived up to their mistakes.  We like it when staffs admit to their mistakes, makes them more human since it's normal for humans to make mistakes...for that, this error was not an error at all :) and we didn't hold it against them.   Overall we had an excellent experience and we will be back!  I rarely give out 5 stars  but they earned it.",

It used to be a nice place to go work and hang out and grab a cup of coffee or a small bite, no more. The coffee is weak and watery and the food is mediocre. Don't go there and expect to just order coffee or something small because the owner will bombard you with his over zealous sales pitch, \"can I get you something to eat?\" \"No thank you, coffee is fine.\" \"Are you sure? We have omlettes, we, have great xyz.\" That's just a snippet, he went on longer with the other options and had a hard time taking no for an answer, very relentless, pushy, and off putting.",

We have been to Hob Nobs on several occasions when the music was provided by \"The Refugees from the 60's\"  They have a nice selection of beers including my personal favorite Kiltlifter from the Four Peaks Brewing Co.  So why only 3 stars you ask? Good question, there is nothing really that is a problem, though I would rather there were a wait staff instead of all orders being placed at the register. There is  both inside and outside seating. For you coffee drinkers even some living room style furniture to camp out in.  Quite simply we would not trek out here except that we really enjoy this band. By the end of the evening my bottom is sore as the band sets up right in front of the comfy seats. So the pluses are that the place is interesting, and you can get a coffee or a brew with a good sandwich. Sadly there is nothing so outstanding that if it weren't for 3'rd Friday music we just wouldn't be hanging out here.",

Amber, who took our order clearly thinks customer service is beneath her.  We ordered cesar salads and a sandwich.  The salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who's uniform was clearly encrusted with a week's worth of food debris.  Gross... but where the hell is my sandwich?  After 17 minutes of waiting for the sandwich, I asked the soccer mom behind the counter, to which she replied, \"Hon, they take a few minutes.\"  After another five minutes, I got pissed.  It is a sandwich.  Nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb.  Bread, meat, cheese, garnish, and a few condiments.  Pretty basic stuff, right?    When I finally complained to the bald guy in the bad Hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place, he simply said, \"sorry\" and made the sandwich in front of me.  Amber, the emo counter girl, started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had  called off.  Bad Hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke.  I watched through the window as she commiserated with filthy cook guy, and then returned to work without bothering to wash her hands.  Gross again.  I would eat daily at the Phoenix Rescue Mission before setting foot in Hob Nobs again.  At least there the staff is nice, and want to help.",

    "text": "I liked this place the first time I went. They had a good deal on their brunch items, including a bottomless bloody mary for $10. Had like 5 of them and never felt a thing but oh well I suppose. Still tasted good. The second time though, not so great. We were overcharged for the lox bagel we ordered, and then the vanilla latte was way too sweet and only 2/3 full. Also they forgot to even make the vanilla latte when we ordered it....We had to go back and ask for it again. They were friendly but super spacey, obviously not focused on doing a high quality job. Not sure we will be returning.",

The service is consistently great and the employees are always friendly. The Albacore and Chicken Salad sandwiches are my favourite and have been of consistent/great quality each time I've ordered. Really enjoy sitting in the North section of the house as to take in the sun and enjoy the stained-glass creations hanging from the windows. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Owwwwwhhhhhhhhh, this place is sooooooo delightful! The staff here, especially the blonde dude working the counter, are totally awesome, helpful gems. I forgot about this place and have been wanting to check it out since the remodel. Being in the neighborhood I stopped by. I always felt the name of this place says it all. One of those vintage old house reinvented into a restaurant. Each room is meant to be like a different reading/relaxing nook areas. Different feel, different decorations, different furniture, with a different thematic feel to each room. I sat in the silver furniture section-ha. Love the bookshelves with reading material. If you pick the back room I guarantee you will probably forget you are in a restaurant. It even has a TV.  Also, the entire place is covered with art work hanging on the walls for sale, by I assume local artists. They also have some jewelry for sale. BUY LOCAL! GOTTA LOVE IT! This is a totally fun and cute place. Very artistic for my inner creative Drama Queen. The place was also packed.     Ok, so now onto the food. I am a chicken salad fanatic so I got the Voodoo Chicken Salad for something totally different and unique. I think I got it because the name was so clever. Cajun Chicken Salad= Voodoo ha, ha, ha! Honestly, I was not really in love with it through no fault of the restaurants. It is just very different. I think I will just stick with my traditional view of white regular chicken salad and my addiction to Casella's Deli-the best!. However, this sandwich was still tasty enough. I would like to go back and try some other Hobnob sandwiches and or salads especially since I hear their Hummus is the best in town. On the way out I got all excited because I spied a Black and White cookie out of NY. I had already ordered a slice of their Coconut Cake which BTW I am eating right now as inspiration while writing this review. ( It is good) I can't wait to try the B/W cookie later or tomorrow for an Easter treat,  Finally, since it is a coffee house I got a White Chocolate Mocha for the road. The server was so helpful when he recommended I add Cinnamon and Caramel topping and sauce flavoring to it. Add it, I did and it was divine! All in all a fattening day here in Phoenix.To end this review I do have to say parking is awful and the place is pricey but as Arnold likes to say,  \"I'll be back.\"",

    "text": "I am really disappointed to see so many so-so reviews of this place.   I have been quite a few times and the coffee drinks and food have always been terrific.  I had a white chocolate Mocha latte that kept me going all day-- I usually stay away from the fluffy, sweet coffee drinks as they just don't pack the punch of a double espresso ,but this one was great!   As well , the roast sirloin sandwich was quite tasty (although, I did ask for the aioli on the side and although it was, there was an odd spread of mustard on the bread, which was not listed on the menu).    Service has always been friendly and helpful and I do love the decor/feeling of the place.  The old willo house always had a slightly grime-y feel to it and I really wondered if they ever cleaned behind that counter.    SO, let's just remember that this is NOT a chain restaurant, this is a LOCAL place that we can walk to, and it is a SMALL business that we should support just because it is a good idea.      Really, if we would get off our high horses,  and stop poo-poo this and poo- poo that  , and realize that if we don't support local businesses, we will end up with a WALMART at Central and McDowell.     Give 'em good feed back, constructive critisism, and let's keep a Payday loan store from taking the space!",

The VooDoo chicken salad was a refreshing (and spicy) take on an old standby. Not creamy and textured almost like an olive tapenade, it was piled liberally onto whole wheat bread. The Smokey Joe turkey sandwich was solid as well, boasting thick slices of crisp bacon. The high light was definitely the Tortilla Chicken soup. A thick, savory broth with fresh veggies and chunks of white meat topped with tortilla strips and sour cream. Hob Nobs is a welcome, if somewhat pricey, choice for a mid town lunch.",

Parrking was a bit of a pain and I had to circle the block twice to finally find a street spot 1 block South but made my appointment on time at noon. I was immediatly impressed with the building, interior and exterior decor and general ambiance. I met my associate at a comfortable front room table and ordered a black tea. I found it pleasantly unusual that they had live entertainment (singer/guitarist) on a Tuesday at noon. After my business was completed and I parted with my associate I looked around the place and enjoyed what appeared to be a revolving art exhibition, browsed the food selections & menu and decided that this would be my new meeting place for casual business & social engagements.",

The wooden floors are beautiful and everything was comfortable and very clean. The coffee was decent and the food selection is limited but awesome for a small coffee shop. Don't try the verve energy drink though...you could choke a horse with that small can of canine venom.  Prices were good 6-7 bucks for a sandwich and 2-4 for a tasty beverage of your choice.",

I called in my order for pick-up, as I only have a short period of time in which to pick up and eat my lunch.  The person who took my order stated it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When I arrived there around 15-20 minutes later there were approximately 6 people ahead of me in line, so I had to wait about another 10 minutes until I could advise of my pick up order.  When I got to the register and they looked for my order, it was still in queue to be prepared!  It took them over 30 minutes to get my order completed.  I feel this is an outrageous amount of time and not one person apologized for taking so long to get my order ready.  I have had to wait in the past, but this time it was absolutely ridiculous!  The whole point of calling ahead is to save from having to wait for the order.  I understand when a place is busy, but having to wait that long for an order is not acceptable.",

They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, it's still a nice place for coffee. For those who haven't been, it's set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area. But, to stay on topic, the menu is a bit pricey but Hob Nob's has retained the Willo House's cozy, neighborly feel, though yes, over a few short years it transitioned from hippie to yuppie.",

The smoothie was decent although I wish that I knew what was in it. It does not list it and I could tell it had berries but I don't know what else.   The delivery person decided to walk right past the person at my work that sits at the door and precedes to walk towards the back of the office which is not allowed because we do have sensitive information in our office.   Overall it's the same quality of food I've always gotten from there. Some plates are to die for like the pesto chicken sandwich, others not so much like any salad I've tried.",

It looks out of place on McDowell Road in Phoenix, but I'm glad there is such a charming place here.   There are many rooms to sit in, a couple comfy couches and chairs, an outdoor patio, art by locals to look at, board games to play and books to read. They have a kitchen and serve real food as well as pastries and sweets and they also serve alcohol - beer, wine and hard alcohol.  The parking lot is behind the building and basically has about 6 spaces, so you might have to park a little ways away and (heaven forbid!) actually walk!  They have live music on some nights and depending on who is playing, it could be amazingly good or horrendously awful. The volume is such that it will affect your decision to stay or go.  The food is decent, with a few veggie options - salad, sandwiches, pizzas. Overall a good place with lots of charm and a good vibe.",

There is no rhyme or reason to entering this place and figuring out where you're supposed to go and where you're supposed to order.   I'm sure it would be fine for just a coffee or beer, but I highly discourage ordering food.    To make matters worse,  I asked the cashier how long my food would take when I ordered, she said 7-10 minutes- it took 30.  No apologies other than \"sorry we're real behind.\"    I am not outrageously picky,  but the three things we ordered were all unappealing. I like supporting local biz, but come on people.  oh,  and coffee sucked.   The end.",

We were planning on eating breakfast, but we ordered just coffees because they seemed so slow and we were in a hurry.  After ordering a mocha and a chai with almond milk we waited 10 minutes. We finally had to ask for our money back and the girl didn't even know we had ordered. She said she could make the drinks quickly. She then tried to charge us again!  She made the drinks quickly, but they were both the wrong size and the almond milk chai was made with real milk. My friend couldn't drink it because he is lactose intolerant.  Overall a terrible experience and a waste of our time. 20 minutes and we walked out with one coffee. These people need some training in customer service.",

    "text": "I have to say, I am very disappointed with this place! By far the worst experience I have ever had at a local coffee shop (usually everyone is very nice). I have been here several times and have never had a problem until this afternoon.. I come here at least once a week since I moved to the area a few months ago and have even brought a few friends here to show them this place.. After my experience today, I will never go here again..  This afternoon, I went here to do some homework (I go to school full-time as well as work full time at one of the hospitals down the road so need a good place to study). With it being hot outside (as is often the case in Arizona), I asked for a glass of water and then went to a table in the back to start working. I barely set down my backpack when the owner walks over to me and asks if I was planning on buying anything.. I let her know that I would be at some point (with it being 4pm, and having worked since 6am this morning, I would get hungry soon and need a coffee pick-me-up). Even after telling her that, she began to let me know that her tables were prime real-estate and, with it being real-estate, I needed to have something that I had bought from there on the table.. I tried to explain to her how I come here all the time and order drinks and food.. She quickly questioned what I had ordered in the past (I usually order black iced coffee and one of their pizzas in case you're wondering). She then told me how she couldn't let squatters just come here to sit (her words not mine). I eventually asked her if she was kicking me out, to which she explained (again) how I needed to buy something.. Well, I definitely got her hint and since she clearly didn't believe me, I threw away my water and walked out..   First off, I will never ever be back to this coffee shop again. I have never been so clearly disregarded as a customer and kicked out of a place for going there to do homework and go here weekly.    Second, if you at all value customer service and being treated decently, go to Copper Star Coffee. It is only 5 minutes away (8 in traffic) and is well worth the slightly extra drive. The coffee is better, the food is better, and the owner and employees are amazing and very nice!! They also offer you a free pastry on your first visit. :)   Last, to the owner, just a little advice.. even if you are having a bad day, you should still treat every person as a valuable customer and as a valuable person. Even on your worst day, there are people who have had an even more terrible day (I witness it firsthand every day at the hospital). And I know I am only one customer, but even one customer is better than none..   To all potential customers, I hope this helps you decide if you want to come here, or decide to take your business elsewhere, as I have..",

The only downfall and literally the only one is that the order process is terrible! You can walk in and have one or two people in front of you and it will seriously take 20 mins to place an order because one person is taking and filling the order before they love on to the next person. Sounds good that they help you right there but it would be much more efficient if hey took your order and let you sit down while someone else made it and the person taking the order just took the next one. Other than that this place is awesome. Super homey feel and delicious food.",

After I was able to park and not worry too much about getting towed, I got to talk to the owner.  there was a Guitars For Vets thing going on and the owners were very accomodating to Vets that day.  As a tea drinker, I was impressed with their black tea.  They have a full bar and a great selection of food, coffee, and tea.  The building has seperate rooms for parties, an outdoor patio area that covers two sides of the building, and is in the upscale arts area.  It is not snooty though.  Each room is decorated with art by local artists.  there is also live music by the fireplace, but since there are so many options for seating, you can choose whether or not to take part in the live music.  I like it.",

All breakfast options are very inexpensive. Bagel, lox and fixins is only $5.95! It's 12 bucks at Panera!   And bonus, there's relaxing, live, brunch music often.

Positive: Sandwiches (the Carver and the Smokey Joe) Excellent choices, tasty, filling and not too pricey for in house service. Hob Nob Cobb was great as well; good looking greens, didn't skimp on meats and cheese, overall portion looks and tastes good.  Negative; Delivery time was fine, but the pizza I ordered (Roman Red Pepper) tasted more like a crispy flatbread than anything else. Overall nice place, but I would skip the delivery service and dine in instead.",

    "text": "Hob Nobs is completely unrecognizable from the old Willo House... and you know what?  That's ok.  Let's be honest.  The Willo House coffee really wasn't very good, and the service was pretty lacking.  So I'm over it.  On to Hob Nob... it's a really lovely remodel, if a little slick and glossy.  I thought the coffee was very good.  I haven't been able to eat there yet, but the menu looks great, if a little pricey.  Pastry selection seemed a little small too, especially as coffee shop= guilt free decadent eating in my mind, so I want some outrageous and fatty desserts to choose from.  Local artwork on the walls, with some pieces that I really loved.  The tables each have a different SUPER cool picture of Phoenix.  Very nice service, and I believe they said they'd be offering 2 hours of free wi-fi if you are a paying customer.    I've been twice now, and I liked it ok... I just didn't LOVE it.  It took me forever to write this review, as I don't have anything bad to say about it at ALL, but for whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to rave about it.   It's not especially homey, somehow, even as nice as it looks.  I'll have no problem going back next time someone says \"hey let's go to Hob Nob's\", but it's just not my first pick.    Here's hoping that they DO find the perfect crowd that does love them though, and I really hope they succeed.",

I also love the use of local art to adorn the walls. This place just has a good feel about it.   The flip side is probably that they are a little pricey. This is bad considering some of the local shops that have better food and coffee at better prices. So, all in all, this place is a good little stop for some pretty good coffee and comfort.",

Saw it was now called Hob Nobs Coffee House and almost didn't stop but thought what the heck. Glad I did.   Doesn't have the retail that used to be at Willow House but they do still have the artwork, which is amazing to look at and different seating areas to choose from.   Have had the chicken Caesar salad both times I've been there. Yum. Good amount of chicken, shaved parm, large, homemade croutons and great dressing. Definitely will try something else next time. I'm sure the rest of the dishes are just as flavorful.   Had to get a goody from the pastry case. OMG! Got a red and white cookie (same as black and white but obviously red instead of black in honor of the AZ Cardinals) and got a brownie to take home for later. Yum, yum, yum! By far the best black and white style cookie we've ever tasted. And the brownie, nice and chocolaty.   Took a book in with me to read while eating and had a nice relaxing time. Good music in the background and didn't feel any pressure to get the heck out when I was done eating.   Friendly employees are there to serve you. Hope you enjoy!",

Its a nice and trendy place, with art for purchase along the walls. The server/sandwichmaker/barista was not only cute, but friendly. The menu here is more than adequate, with a few tantalizing items. I ordered the pizza (10in) hob nob pesto with sausage and my boy had the docs choice sandwich. The food came out in approx 10 min, and she brought it to us. The pizza was FANTASTIC. Definitely wasn't expecting it to be that good. I also ordered a black and white iced mocha, and it was served in a huge cup (Starbucks aficionados think venti+a little bit more) and it was awesome as well. Prices are reasonable (13.50) for mine. Apparently they have live music here on certaindays, and they have an expansive beer selection. I will definitely be coming back here.",

Getting to Hob Nobs is a bit complicated. It's located on a one way street (headed North). Parking can also be a bit of a pain. The parking lot next to Hob Nobs is small but there is another across the street - but it's easy to miss so you need to be vigilant.   The bistro has outside seating making it a lovely place to meet friends and hang out -especially this time of year. Inside are lovely wood floors and lots of light.   I had the Carver Sandwich for lunch which somehow didn't live up to my expectations. The roast beef seemed process and the of feta and cheddar was awkward for me. I looked longingly at my friends sandwich. She had the Smokey Joe sandwich with Turkey and Bacon -- that looked fresh and yummy and I'll try that next time.   I say - give the place a go.",

    "text": "I really liked the food here at first. I also love that they deliver, serve espresso drinks, and have a relatively friendly staff. Actually a GREAT staff, with wonderful customer service and the genuine attitude of a local business that cares about their customers. However it is hit or miss, because they seem to have a girl answering phones and taking orders who is a COMPLETE IDIOT. Not only is she an idiot, but she lacks any sense of customer service, and has a very bitchy \"what do you want\" kind of attitude with people. To call her mentally challenged would be an insult to the mentally challenged, seeing as I have dined there twice and seem to know a great deal more about the restaurant and the services they provide than this bimbo. I took two stars off JUST for her and if she is working or answering the phone when I come in, I will take my business elsewhere.  ***Edit: After I received a friendly message from the owner apologizing and offering a free meal, (which I have yet to accept and probably never will) I returned because I liked the food so much and wanted to share the fun environment with a guest. Both of the girls working treated me heinously from the instant we approached the counter. Perhaps they had seen this review and recognized me, or perhaps they just have impossibly terrible manners and attitudes. Either way, they do not seem like friendly people who understand that customers are supposedly to be treated with respect. Although the owner seems to be a wonderfully dedicated and kind person, I cannot give anything higher than 1-star after the way I have been treated. I am not a very resilient person; I am emotionally sensitive. My feelings were hurt to be treated that way especially after the several crappy experiences that I had prior. To be perfectly clear, even though I did not feel good about the way I was treated I never went out of my way to make those girls feel bad about how poorly they were behaving while they were being paid to do so, and I truly feel that their actions are entirely unjustified. Ideally, they would also be held responsible, as unlikely as this is. Also, please note that most of the negative reviews about the staff have been flagged, meaning someone who works there is fully aware of the problem and refuses to do a single thing about it. Just wow.",

    "text": "Cut me a little slack - I'm a transplant to Arizona from Sonoma County which is probably one of the most eclectic, snobbiest, liberal, expensive places on EARTH to live *but* at the same time, I was never short of quaint, cool, funky little hang-outs.    Hob Nobs reminded me of something I'd find in Sonoma County but without the feeling that anybody was looking down their nose at me or the hippy serving me hadn't washed their hair since they lived in the haight-ashbury district in the 70's.   The staff was nice, cleanly, knowledgeable of the ingredients (all the sauces & mayo are made from scratch), and were smart enough to get my order right.  That's a HUGE plus.     I had never been here when it was the Willo House so I have no reference to the extent of the remodeling but - as it is now - the interior is very nice with beautiful wood floors, fun paint colors on the walls, artwork everywhere featuring local artists, and several different rooms all with a different feel where you can hide & chill, be amoung people, or even seat 8 or 10 and hold a meeting.  I'm with Kenny B... I could sit here for hours and check out the eye-candy.  I had a spinach salad with chicken, mandarin oranges, and candied pecans.  It was a good salad - my only complaint was that the chicken on the salad was actually chicken salad.  I was expecting grilled chicken (no mayo) but it was still very yummy.  My b/f had a spicy chicken salad sandwich which - to me - was too spicy but the sweet little side of cole-slaw contrasted the fire and cooled it down a bit.  I probably wouldn't order it again... but the selection of sandwiches drew my attention enough to already have picked out my \"next time I'm gonna have...\"  So yes, for me... there will be a next time.  However, I'm giving it a 4 because I agree with most reviewers... it's a bit overpriced.  It was $22 for lunch for 2 people (a salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks).  It's fine for once-in-a-while lunches but too high to be a regular lunch resource.    I know it's odd for a soda-fountain to be found in a coffee house but let's face it... Most coffee houses serve coffee & specialty drinks (along with a semi-fresh bagel or scone or biscotti...).  Hob Nobs is not *just* a coffee house.  The food here was well planned and prepared... not just an after-thought.  It's really more of a cafe / house than a coffee house.",

FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!  *note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it.",

We have only had their coffee and baked goods, but the sandwiches look really good. One of these days, we'll try them. Apparently they also have acts come and perform which is always fun at a coffee shop.
