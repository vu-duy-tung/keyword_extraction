It was very clean, as it should be being brand new.  The brisket was excellent. Good quality meat, nice deep smoke ring, good crust. They were out of pork (how could that be?) so I had a sausage link which was nothing special. The potato salad was quite good. The beans were not up to the quality you get at Honey Bear's, but OK.  On the sign they listed Coke products for fountain drinks, but the fountain actually had Kalil products (RC Cola, for example).  I will go back, if only to find out if the pork is any good.",

Get the baked beans, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread as sides...trust me. Must warn everyone though, this is a heavy meal that's flavorful. If you're looking for a healthy option this is NOT the place. This is more of a cheat meal packed high in proteins AND bad fats...delicious nonetheless.",

I had a brisket bowl - never thought to have BBQ that way. It was really good. The brisket was very tender and juicy with a bit of crust on the edges. Lots of choices for toppings/additions. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich. He thought the pork was a little fatty for his taste, but once he got rid of some of the fat he thought it was very good. And their Cole slaw is near perfect in my book - creamy with a just right sweet/tangy flavor. Another great place to eat in our new neighborhood.",

    "text": "Someone else used the words \"salt bomb\" in their review - that sums it up perfectly!  I was in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. I wanted to get a feel for the offerings, so I decided to order the two meat and two sides platter. I requested pork and brisket (they were out of pork, so I switched to chicken) as the meats, and the potato salad and beans for the sides. The employees behind the counter were great. Friendly, able to answer questions, and in good moods. The place is kept clean, and given the \"off\" time I visited, plenty of table space to choose from. The meats are served without sauce - and there are four sauces on the table to choose from. (Mild, sweet, mustard based, and hot.) The potato salad was nice. Maybe a little heavy on the red onion - but I happen to like onion, so I didn't mind. The beans were bland, and somehow, the pork in the beans was completely dry and tough. I can't figure out how that's possible - as there's so much liquid in the beans - any meat in there should positively be tender. Then comes the salt bomb! The chicken was so salty, I could barely taste any of the sauces other than the hot, which tasted like a BBQ salt lick. Tasting it without the sauce, I could barely discern any chicken OR smoke, only salt. The brisket (also seen in another review) was almost like a beef jerky. It was so dry and tough - and when tasting without the sauce - I could taste the meat and smoke - but mostly - no surprise here - salt! In the time it took me to eat the potato salad, half the beans and half the meat, I went through three cups of iced tea, and filled my cup a fourth time on my way out - and was still thirsty). I ended up throwing away over half the meat and leaving still hungry - I just can't handle all that salt. There are several options for decent BBQ in the area - I won't be coming back here at all.",

For starters the menu is deceiving and doesn't contain enough info to explain what each thing comes with. The service line is disorganized and quite gross - mixing of utensils, dirty service, prep area, and poor temperature control - food borne illness waiting to happen. Upon ordering a brisket sandwich the employee thought it was acceptable to put pieces of nothing but fat in basket to weigh as part of order. When I called him on it, he removed fat out and proceeded to do it again with the end part/trash part of brisket.  People in line behind me were as astounded as I was. After that, I cancelled order and left.   Eat there at your own risk!",

It was all in a ball wrapped in foil and all mixed together so it all tasted the same.  It should be kept separate so one can enjoy the flavors of each individual meat.

The bbq is ok in flavor but dry. This is ok because they have sauce but you would expect a bbq joint to have very juicy meat. The worst experience was when we used UberEATS. We asked for extra sauce one of each kind because they have 4. We didn't receive any sauce at all. We called Uber who called the restaurant which said they only give 1 cup of sauce even though we didnt get any. For this reason I recommend avoiding using delivery or going elsewhere if you want juicy bbq.",

The main reason I did not give  it stars was due to the service. They were not rude nor were they friendly. We were clearly taking some trying to understand the menu as fisrt timers and they did not seem very thrilled about is doing so. The food was excellent though.",

I originally ordered the shredded pork but as the girl starting putting it on the plate I realized how much fat was on it so I swapped it to the brisket. Since that's what my boyfriend ordered and that's what looked better. The brisket appeared to LOOK less fatty. I also got the beans and corn bread as the side. As for my boyfriend he chose corn bread and sweet potato fries as his sides. The brisket was externally fatty. To the point where I had to actually spit it out mid chew. There was no actually good piece of meat on either of ours. The flavor was good though. The beans were the best thing but you can't ever go wrong with beans. Corn bread was old and dry. Or just over baked. My boyfriend didn't get his fries since non were prepared it took 10-15 minutes to get his fries which we were both done eating by that time. By the reviews I have read this place is a hit or miss.",

    "text": "My husband and fellow yelper bookmarked this hidden gem a few months ago. We were downtown today after a meeting at his office, and he suggested we try Pork on a Fork for a late lunch. I agreed and was not disappointed! I love BBQ, and have been to several BBQ joints, and POF was top notch. When I checked in I received an offer of 25% off!! Awesome!  POF is located in an outdoor mall, I felt it was hard to find, as it was our first time here and the signage was lacking letting us know where to go. After walking a bit, we finally found it. We walked in and was met with hello's and big smiles. After reviewing the menu, which is on a digital board, I decided on a pulled pork sandwich. It came with 2 sides and I chose the mac-n-cheese and waffle fries. The fries were fried fresh upon my order, and were hot, crispy and delicious. The mac-n-cheese was omg yummy. It had just a little kick to it, not overwhelming. My sandwich was okay. Here's where my personal preference comes in, although the pork was tender, I felt it was bland and dry. I put the sweet and mild sauce on, and I had to put a lot on to get it to my preference. The bun was soft and fresh. The restaurant was clean and bright. There are several big screen tv's, and colorful art. The prices were reasonable, and the customer service was good. I am glad we came to POF and I can't wait to go back, especially since my husband has their 25% off check in offer as well :) he saves his for later!",

I should have suspected something because at 12:30 pm there were only 2 other people eating. Likely never to return to this place, too many choices for a good value lunch that taste yummy. Two young employees working, we didn't complain about the temperature or the late fries. Going back to work we met several other co-workers coming back from lunch as well, they asked where did we go, once we told them, they all agreed, been there, food was below average. \"That place suc-s\"",

Theirs was perfectly smoked, great smoke ring just enough fat remaining to seal in the juices. The sausage chicken and pulled pork was just as perfect. Finally if you are a sauce person definitely try what they have to offer. Now what about the sides? Those too were made to perfection, don't miss the Mac and cheese and when they ask if you want seasoning on it say YES. If you are anywhere near one of their locations in Phoenix stop in!",

I came in at the same time as one other couple who intended to dine in. I already knew I wanted my order to go. Three employees were behind the counter and nary a one of them greeted me ( or the couple behind me). I gave my order (pork sandwich w/beans n cac salad as my sides) . i ordered a drink n asked if any desserts were available. Yep. They still had one peach and one berry cobbler left. I asked for the peach and then while dispensing my lemonade went into a coughing fit that nearly made me pass out. The cashier stood on the other side of the counter and just stared at me, even as i dropped to my knees from coughing. I was rather embarrassed so as soon as i was able i grabbed my bag and stumbled to the door. I was all the way to the car when i realized she hadnt put my cobbler in the bag. I finally found the strength to go back for my cobbler. Said cashier wa nowhere in site so i told the young man I had paid for and did not receive my cobbler. He looked up my order on the register, then hollared to verify with the cashier that i had indeed paid for cobbler and she indeed do forget to put it in the bag. This whole process took probably another 6 minutes or so",

The ladies behind the counter were welcoming and very nice. I ordered the deluxe sampler- chicken, pork, and brisket. The brisket and pork were the stars of the show, with the chicken close behind. BBQ sauces on the table were tasty as well. I liked the Zippy Mustard and Smokey Tangy the best. The baked beans were the best I've had in a long time. Coleslaw could use a flavor boost- I asked for some pickled onions on the side, and that helped the coleslaw quite a bit. They suggested the Mac and cheese to try, and I should have tried it instead of the coleslaw. Oh well, next time! I'll be back for sure.",

All of the meats were moist and juicy with a delicate smokiness. I liked that it was not overpowering.  I had the baked beans and coleslaw for my sides and both were delicious. Beans were well seasoned and slow cooked so that the flavors were developed through out. The coleslaw was crisp and well seasoned My favorite sauce was the tangy bbq. The hot was too salty for my taste but worked well if mixed together.  Service was great and would recommend for lunch or dinner.",

Chicken, brisket, sausage and pulled pork. As for sides we tried potato salad, macaroni salad, mac n cheese and cornbread. My favorite was the brisket and mac n cheese. Delicious and worth a repeat visit!",

It certainly wasn't good enough to make up for the horrible customer service. You lost me as a customer after my very first visit.",

It's not easy finding a good BBQ place in Arizona. This is the best one I've been to. All the meats were melt-in-your-mouth tender. My favorite was the brisket. Plastic fork, no knife needed for any of it. 4 sauces at the table (sweet, smoky, hot, zippy mustard) so you can have your choice of sauce. I tried them all and the sweet BBQ was my favorite.   Everything is made from scratch. The Mac and cheese was a strong co-star in the dish. I would have given 5 stars but the soda machine was broken so it was only tea, and I wanted a Coke to wash it all down with.  Very positive and recommended experience. I will be back for sure.",

When we let them know about the bone they replaced their pork shoulder and offered us another sandwich and sides. The guy was very apologetic. Not sure if we'll give it another go or not.

Pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides consisting of waffle fries & the macaroni salad 2nd plate was a Sausage sandwich w/2 sides consisting of cold slaw & BBQ beans.  1.  Pulled pork sandwich = meat was generous, tasty and flavorful.  The BBQ sauce the provided added much flavor and was sweet and smooth - very good.  The waffle fries were very tasty, not hot enough... I would have liked them warmer but they were flavorful.  The macaroni salad was your standard \"picnic macaroni salad\" but had a lot of flavor to it.  2.  Sausage sandwich = generous serving and also flavorful (crisp casing and not greasy).  The slaw was a \"no\" not good - strange flavor, spicy cabbage.  The beans were average (mushy from over cooking) but flavorful.  Storefront was clean, quiet and almost empty (not a good sign or it could have been too late for lunch crowd - but on a Sat?).  The staff was friendly, cordial and quick.  They took my order timely and had it to me at the end of the counter and ready to go (and the order was correct).  Pricing was average, after all meat is expensive no matter where you go and you are paying for a MEAL (with two sides).  Overall rating... a 4 to 4.5.  I definitely will come back here when I get the need for beef... BBQ beef (or pork) that is.",

    "text": "I will preface this review by saying that this is my first one on Yelp; although I use (and appreciate) reviews on it frequently.  My partner and I eat out several times a week and like to try new places once in a while. We went here on a Sunday night (just got home from eating there) and there was one small family there. The girl who took our order didn't greet us and seemed quite apathetic. My partner has a Groupon, but was unable to download it on his phone. He asked the cashier, who we found out was also the manager, for the WiFi password. She said that the owner has it and she doesn't know it. No apologies, nothing. So my partner made a comment about the fact that she obviously didn't care. So, we figured we'd use the Groupon a next time (see where this is going?). My partner ordered waffle fries as a side. The girl who took our order called back for waffle fries, as none were available.   My cole slaw and mac 'n cheese were pretty good. My pulled pork sandwich was pretty good too, except for the chunk of bone that I bit into. The sandwich was lukewarm at best and a bit on the dry side. But like I said, pretty good. So we were halfway through our meal and still no waffle fries. The acoustics are pretty good in the restaurant and we heard the \"manager\" and the girl who took our order talking about us. They mentioned something about calling the owner regarding the WiFi. My partner went to the counter to inquire about his fries. The girl who took his order asked \"waffle fries or sweet potato fries?\" Umm, she took our order about 15 minutes ago. So no waffles fries were put in the deep fryer. We cancelled the fries, as our meal was almost over.   So, decent food, but horrible service. Oh and there were dirty napkins on the floor and food scraps on some tables - with only a few customers in the place. We'll get a refund on that Groupon and move on...",

I'm glad they still had my brisket or that would have been a long drive for nothing. I believe they were down to chicken and ribs. I got mac & cheese and potato salad for my sides and they were tasty. Lady behind the counter was on the phone asking customers if they wanted something else or to cancel their order. I'm sure they were disappointed because the food here is really good!",

    "text": "Normally Pork on a Fork is my go to for lunch and tonight I decided to get it for take out for dinner for me and my husband. I regret this decision as this is by far one of the worst meals I have ever had.   For $30, I got a Beef Briskit meal and a Briskit BBQ bowl. They gave about half of the portions of both meat and sides then they do during Lunch hours, which is a mixed blessing as the flavor was severely lacking. My BBQ bowl was more than 50% potato salad. This normally would not be a big deal as I usually love POAF's potato salad, but tonight it was a gloopy, watery, odd tasting mess. It is pretty gross and I tried separating out as much edible food as I could. My husband took one bite of his potato salad and scraped the rest into the garbage.   The meat in my husband's meal was very fatty. He did like the flavor, and was satisfied with the cornbread muffin, paltry as it was. Most of what I brought home ended up being thrown away. If I lived closer I would have taken it back. Instead this was a very expensive lesson: avoid Pork on a Fork after 2pm.",

    "text": "If I could give no stars, I would give that rating with no hesitation.  This establishment is nearby our place of work and we happened to remember their food was quite delicious in the past.  The food was great but the to-go service has an opportunity for change.  Initially, we had ordered through Grubhub.  Busy day and we couldnt leave the office.  So through the app, we had ordered two pulled pork burritos and a deluxe sampler with brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  When the order came, the deluxe sampler was missing the sausage (which was subbed for chicken), the burritos had no rice or beans, and no bbq sauces were packed with the order.  The issue here is that the deluxe costs more so we were charged extra for something that was lower on the menu.  We called Pork on a Fork and we were notified that the person packed the order was the manager.  We were told that the manager himself had packed the order so the order must be correct.  Also we were told that the burrito did not come with rice or beans so it must be added as a side, to add them into the burrito.  After being on the phone for a few minutes, the manager stated that we would receive store credit for a future visit.  So taking his word, we ordered the next day to use this store credit.  So this time, instead of using the Grubhub app, we ended up calling in the order.  We ordered the deluxe sampler and the pulled pork burrito.  We asked to add the beans and rice.  The lady on the phone immediately told us that it automatically came with beans and rice....  So disregarding that comment, we asked to have sausage, brisket and pulled pork.  We commented that we had store credit and we heard in the background, the manager states, \"yes i know them, they have store credit.\"  Though once he heard that we ordered the deluxe, we heard, \"No they didnt order the deluxe.  They get chicken, no brisket or sausage.\"  After disputing the fact that it literally shows \"Deluxe Sampler\" on the Grubhub app, to no avail they said no.  We then cancelled the order.  The food here is decent but it really isn't worth the headache of the management.  We were here a few weeks ago prior to this snafu and couldn't figure out why it was dead at noon.  Now we know why.    There's plenty of food options around this area.  In and out, Panera, Wendy's, multiple pizza options, Whole Foods, I could go on.  Plus dropping $50 for lunch isn't exactly the cheapest.  We will not be back.",

Let me tell you I have been craving barbecue for a long time but I'm very picky about my barbecue, but Yelp suggested this place to me and I read all the reviews and decided to give it a go and I am soooooo glad I did!!! This is definitely bookmarked and my new favorite barbecue spot. :D   So let's talk about the food, I ordered the Midwest monster (which comes with not one but TWO sides) and for my side I chose the honey barbecue beans and the mac & cheese. Both sides were freaking phenomenal! The mac & cheese was just as cheesy as I like it, and the honey baked beans literally reminded me of barbecues with my family. The Midwest monster- ugh! To die for!!! It's half pork and a half brisket, The meet is nice, juicy and tender and mix with all the right flavors! For my drink I got a sweet tea (i'm addicted to sweet tea) and not everybody sweet tea is good, but there is exactly what you expect Southern Sweet tea to taste like. :)  On top of everything else the staff was extremely friendly, the establishment was clean, and the atmosphere was nice. Definitely coming back for you!",

The coleslaw was quite refreshing with great flavor, baked beans were excellent with a mild pepper taste, the chicken and pork were also excellent but the brisket was surprisingly dry. Assortment of BBQ sauces was a nice selection, decor was good. I would've given them 4 stars for food but I'm giving them 3 stars for service because there was only 1 person in front of me and the meat carver was painfully slow. There was no smile and I could barely hear what he was asking due to his mumbling. The 2nd server who compiled my sides was very nice and pleasant but I asked several times for something and even after I was seated, I realized I still didn't have it so had to get up and ask again. I'd give them another try again if in the area since I did enjoy the food.",

Problem is I just haven't found any of their meats to be that amazing and their sides, other than the mac & cheese, are all just average. The mac & cheese is yummy though so I would recommend that.  Parking at this location can be a bit of a pain during peak times but there are quite a few 10 minute parking spots directly out front if you're here to grab takeout.  This is a good place if you want some quick BBQ but not where you go to get melt in your mouth 5 star meat.",

The lady at the register was rude to us & told us we had to order before we get to the register.  Went back to the food line to order & after waiting a few minutes with 4 employees ignoring us my husband asked if this is where we were to order.  We were told yes and were continued to be ignored.  We waited a while longer and our order was finally taken.  We get to the register to pay & they give our food to the lady in front of us.  We told them it was our order and not hers and they argued with us and told us that she ordered online so she gets her order first.  We argued again that it shouldn't matter - that was our order (not even the same thing she ordered) & they bagged it up for her anyway.  The lady at the register asked if it was our order and we said yes, but that is fine, we can order it again.  Then they pulled her order out of her bag and gave it to us where we again argued that it was her order and she had our order.  The manager lady did look very busy trying to train everyone but there was only one person in front of us.  There was no way the service should have been this bad.  My husband said the brisket was not good - I had the pork sandwich and it was ok.  They were out of cornbread so we had mac & cheese - nothing special & my son wouldn't even eat his.  Not sure we will be back after the service as there are a lot of other better BBQ joints around but the price was good and they are close so we may give them one more chance once they are open for a while.  Hopefully I will be able to update with more stars.",

The mac and cheese you gotta try with their special spice. At first, I said no thanks to the spice but then the guy said that he'll just sprinkle a little on. I thought that was weird at first, but I'm so glad he did it.   First Step, pick if you want a burrito, bowl, sandwich, Etc. Second Step, pick your meat and then two sides. I got the waffles fries and the mac and cheese.  Gosh how I wish you guys had one of these in California",

    "text": "I was there with four other people, we were all a little disappointed because they only had a few sides to choose from - most were sold out, including the ones we wanted.  Four of us settled for coleslaw and mac n' cheese (which none of us wanted).  One had potato salad, which she said was made with badly under-cooked potatoes.  That lady is a very good cook herself (and owned and operated a barbecue joint with her husband for about a dozen years in NJ).  She said her pulled pork was good.  The rest of us had brisket.  It was a little dry and tough.  I was really hoping it would be very tender (not too far from falling apart).  I mixed two barbecue sauces on mine and was happy with it.  One was the smoky and tangy and the other was the sweet (and something).  I make my own sauce at home and confess to being pretty picky- but it was good, IMHO.  I found the coleslaw unsatisfying.  It was neither sweet nor tangy, but a little dry and bland, though it seemed quite fresh.  My wife enjoyed hers.  She and her Mom got theirs in a bowl and were disappointed that it was all on top of the meat (that is- the mac n' cheese  and the coleslaw were in the same bowl atop the brisket).  That's a bit strange, not in a good way.  To be fair- we got there a little on the late side (not realizing they close at 8pm on Monday).  So it's understandable they could run out of something (but we'd assume one of the meats, and not the sides which don't have to smoke for hours).  The employees were mostly nice (one young lady was trying to clean up and was a bit kurt).  Here's the strangest part of it all:  As we neared the entrance, we saw an electric smoker (and the smoke discs they use to impart the smokey flavor staked in a tube attached to the outside of the small box) outside on the sidewalk with a cord running into an adjacent part of the building.  That sort-of lowered my expectations.  Those expectations were not even met with our experience.  That said- two of our tablemates go there (the 20th street and Highland location in Phoenix) somewhat often and enjoy it, including the lady who is a good cook and a former barbecue owner/operator.  And they don't usually go 40 minutes before closing time.  So this could well have been a bad Monday night.  On the other hand 7:20 isn't so late to begin dinner.  I probably won't go back, given all the places I can count on being good.",

Pork on a fork offers five different sauces, from mild and sweet to smoky and spicy, including a mustard-based sauce, which was pretty good. On this visit find lunch Companions and I I had the pulled pork sandwich, a brisket burrito, chicken, coleslaw, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese.  All of our entrees were  tasty and I really had no complaints, other than I'm really not a fan of bbq.  The sauce selection was good, the cole slaw was not overly sweet though underseasoned, the macaroni and cheese , waffle fries, were all okay.

I can remember the brisket being fresh and juicy at the event. Unfortunately the brisket served to us was rather dry. We came in around 5pm and I could tell the brisket had been sitting under the heating lamp so it definitely wasn't fresh. I don't know what they can do to make it better, but I was almost embarrassed I brought an out of towner here. I normally like to support local businesses, but this time around the food was not impressive. Phoenix has a plethora of BBQ joints and this will be my last time here due to the stiff competition around the valley.",

I don't get to Phoenix often as I live in the east valley, but today I had an appointment just blocks from here. My wife and I decided to stop in for a late lunch . We quickly spotted the POF van from Camelback. After a little searching we found the store on the back side of the mall. At some point you could just follow your nose to the source of the smoky BBQ aroma. Upon entering you are you are greeted with a slow bluesy background music. The place is clean and trendy with plenty of tables.  They must have thought we were nuts, because the first thing we did was to post a selfie by the POF sign in order to claim the 25% off coupon you get when you check in on Yelp. The wait staff greeted us warmly and took our orders. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the highly recommended mac-n-cheese and baked beans for sides. I watched with anticipation as they carefully assembled my sandwich. A generous portion of pulled pork heaped on a fresh baked bun. I wish they would have thrown a couple sliced pickles on as well. One thing you must keep in mind, this pulled pork is not cooked in sauce. If you expect saucy BBQ pork, this is not it. What you get is tender, smoky, juicy slow cooked pork shoulder. There are 4 different amazing sauces to drown your sandwich in at your table.  The mac-n-cheese was fantastic. It was very cheesy, and had a bit of a zing to it. I think it may have been made with sharp cheddar. There was a seasoning sprinkled on top which was the perfectly complimented the dish. The macaroni was cooked perfectly, not sticky, not mushy. I could make this my main course and both sides also. It was truly the best mac-n-cheese I've ever had. The baked beans were good. They were even better with a little spicy BBQ sauce mixed in.  Jake came out to chat with us for a while. He gave us a little history of POF. I told him this was a place Guy Fiere would like. This is just the kind of place he would feature on Drive-ins, Diners, and Dives. Although the food was impressive what impressed me most is Justin's personal response to most of the Yelp posts. This tells me he cares about Yelpers. It's this kind of personal touch that scores POF a spot on my Outstanding Service list.",

They measure out the meat so that every portion is the same but the sides just go right onto the tray so its not very consistent..  The bbq beans and the coleslaw were great. The potato salad was average but the mac salad just tasted like vinegar.   The meats were about what you'd expect. Was okay. Nothing great, nothing terrible. The sauces were good but I would have preferred a side like fries so I could try out each sauce on something else before putting it on my meat.   The sandwich meal is a good deal but I wouldn't get the big boy again. Not worth the price I paid for it.",

I would describe it more as a fast food BBQ place.. got the pulled pork sandwich pretty tasty but bit into a lot of fat- cornbread I couldn't eat because it was cooked for too long so it was hard and stuck to the wrapper not moist or fresh and the MAC n cheese was pretty good! The BBQ sauce was yummy but the hot option isn't really spicy at all- still good place to go if you're craving BBQ and in the area- 5 star for customer service!!",

Company treating employees with respect and sticking up for the ones who are your image and who make up a good percentage of the family negative impact. I just got let go for one customer complaint due to a customer stating  i wiped the counter with a \"sweat towel\" kid you not, this is a real complaint. The owners said they watched the cameras and they felt that since i worked in food for so many years as a manager that it was completely unforgivable. Than following up with my immediate supervisor's comment to me asking if it was real and saying I feel it could have been felt with differently because I know I didn't do such a thing. She stated Maybe you did it without realizing what you were doing. I am not sure. All I know is the lady called the Deer Valley location because our number is not online. That is how it even got to the owners. And they said fire her.  Thank you for that single complaint, I was unemployed 2 years and was blessed to get a job. I just was trying to find a stable home since being homeless is so difficult to get around positively. But one person made me loose faith. I only want to be seen as a person not trash.",

As a native of Phoenix Arizona I can say unequivocally this IS the Best Barbecue I have ever had in all my 39 years of breathing.  My first visit and it won't be my last.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant the beautiful mouthwatering aroma filled the air.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a cornbread muffin.  My hubby got the Big Boy Sampler which included a sample of all their meats; smoked sausage, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and beef brisket.  I ordered a fountain drink RC and found a seat.  To my delightful surprise I had the choice of 4 different sauces to compliment my delicious succulent barbecue.  I also had a taste of the chicken, sausage, and brisket thanks to my loving husband who shared some of his sampler.  After I enjoyed my lunch I met the manager Jake and told him how much I liked everything and how I will be coming back. Whether you are visiting Phoenix or a resident like me Pulled Pork on a Fork is a must!",

It's the kind of bbq you call your dad about to try (seriously, I called him in the middle of my meal!)  It's the kind of bbq you can't stop eating (I could have polished off two of these platters!)  It's the kind of bbq you would wait in line for (but who wants to do that in the Arizona summer??)  It's FAST! (Which is part of their tag line)  I was told they do a smoked prime rib once a month and 100% will be there for that one!  The meats were all amazing- perfect bark and bite on the brisket and ribs, super juicy chicken, just the right amount of heat and smoke. That shredded pork could be one of the best meals in Arizona.   All the sauces were on point. Normally I love a super saucey bbq but their meats really didn't need it. I love that they are all at the table and had to restrain from walking out with a few for home! Haha  Keep up the good work!",

It comes with pulled pork, pulled chicken and link sausage.  I substituted my chicken with pork belly, my 2 sides we're mac n cheese and a mini corn on the cob, my wife's we're mac n cheese and waffle fries, the pork belly came with a dipping mop sauce.  I was surprised the pulled chicken was as tender as the pulled pork, rare at BBQ joints.  All the meats had alot of flavor, tender and juicy.  The mac n cheese was beyond excellent and the waffle fries were excellent. The corn on the cob was kind of bland but I still ate it.  They had your standard pops, lemonade, teas.  I drank alittle each of the lemonade, sweet tea and Big Red soda.  I loved the inside.  Very modern.  Counter service.  The manager(female) explained our options and she came to our table to see how everything was, the history of Pork on a Fork, reward program which is unlike any BBQ place I've ever come across. I highly recommend Pork on a Fork.  It was delicious.",

After checking out the menu I knew I wanted more of a plater style and not so much of a sandwich, bowl or burrito, so I went with BBQ Sampler. My choice of meat, the beef brisket and for the two sides I went with the mac & cheese and bake beans.  The brisket was delish! It was smoky, tender and flavorful, though I did add some of the hot bbq sauce, so dang good! The mac & cheese is some of the best I have tried, cheesy good! Loved the baked beans, reminds me of the ones my grandma used to make.  This was a great stop on a stormy afternoon. Look forward to coming back for some yummy bbq!",

Their Mac n cheese was also very good, very cheesy and the seasoning made it that much better. Bbq beans were the perfect match with the meat and Mac n cheese. Not just that, the ladies working were very helpful in finding something I would like. They let me try the food and they were very patient. Great service and great food!! I am definitely coming back and bringing all my friends. 10/10 would recommend to anyone visiting Phoenix.",

Several times a year I get together with an old high school buddy and he insists I choose where we eat. Sometimes I pick a place I want to try and sometimes I pick a place I want to show off. This was a show off place. I had forgotten he lived only a mile away and shops at the Fry's in the same center. We each had ribs and I had the macaroni and cheese and Cole slaw. I really like my ribs not to need sauce and a bit of chew to them rather than fall off the bone. These did not disappoint. I have always liked that their sides have as much attention to how they taste as the meat does. I know I will be back again at some time.",

I had previously written a followup review stating that I felt the rack of ribs was extremely dry, at which point I heard from one of the owners -- or the owner, Justin.   He suggested I give them another shot, at which time I ignored him.   Then, surprise!  I got an email from the aforementioned social media person stating they had found me.   Well, I was really encouraged to give them another shot, which I did.   I, again, ordered a full rack of their ribs.   I asked for a nonfatty rack, at which time a woman behind the counter was arguing with me that all racks are the same, that is, not fatty.     Uhhh, I have grilled ribs, and I know that they can be fatty.   In fact, I have had fatty ribs at other restaurants, and I don't like all that fat.   Ughhhh!!  The young man brought out the ribs they had; I asked which was the leanest, and he pointed to a rack, which I bought.   Yummm!   I am happy to report they were not dry, and were the same good, smoky, flavorful ribs I had remembered from my original visit to the store.  I am impressed that the owner made such an effort.   I don't really like giving reviews that are less than stellar, but I guess I just like giving my opinion, no matter what it is.   I have gone to restaurants where the reviews were not all that great, and I have had a good experience.  The same could be True for the opposite, that is, the place gets great reviews, and my experience with the food was that the food is awful.  Yes, I will definitely be back.",

The more I come back, the more that I find that I actually really enjoy their brisket. I can't say the same about their chicken or sausage. I find that they are dry and unsatisfying. As far as their brisket, there are times that they have made it the way my favorite barbecue joint has (Little Miss BBQ) - perfectly seasoned, crispy bark on the tender brisket. They have a number of barbecue sauces but I only really like the regular one. As far as sides, I've always been impressed with their beans. Their potato salad is pretty good as well. The rest of the sides unfortunately need some work.   Overall, Pork on a Fork has some room for improvement in some aspects but has the potential to be greater. In the meantime, I will be making my way here for their delicious brisket!",

Last week, we checked out this place. Almost everytime I go to a BBQ place, I check out the chicken/turkey as you can tell the kind of care that is taken to not overdo. Not only was the chicken wonderfully moist, the pulled pork and brisket was VERY good. A choice of sauces tableside complemented the meal. Side dishes, which have a tendency to be relegated to second class in a lot of BBQ places, were equally tasty and didn't taste like a #10 can of anything. The beans were well simmered with chunks of brisket and the potatoes were roasted and flavorfully seasoned. We would recommend highly...and will be back!  Dr. B",

    "text": "Writing this after my second visit:   Food is pretty good, but the service needs attention! Hoping the owners and/or mgmt read and address the following. I live within walking distance, and bbq is one of my favorite foods.  My 3rd visit will be make or break for this place.    1st visit, March 2016: They were open approx 2-3 weeks, we had a party of 5 adults and 2 young kids.  I think our bill was around $70.  After leaving, we all agreed the staff was the worst part of the visit: lack of attention, lackadaisical attitude toward customers, less-than-professional counter attendents, we were generally not impressed.  When we ordered, 3 of us ordered mac-n-cheese for our sides.  The kid behind the counter said \"We've run out, we're making another batch now and it will be ready in 5 minutes\".  That's understandable, no big deal.  We sat down.  There were approximately 3 other tables of customers there, so not busy by any means, and we were the largest group at that time.  We sat within sight of the cash register.  20 minutes later, as I was finishing up my Pulled Pork sandwich, I decided to get up and ask the guy if our mac-n-cheese sides were ready yet.  He said \"Oh yes\" and asked how many I needed, to which I replied \"3\", and he handed them right over.   Why didn't they bring them to our table when they were ready?  Did he really forget how many orders were needed for the item that they were out of?  Wouldn't this be a priority for them?   Anyway, at least we thought our food was tasty.  We chalked up the oversight to new employees and a new restaurant.    2nd visit:  3 months later.  We arrived at 11:20am, they open at 11.  Guy 1 stood behind the cash register, I'm not sure what he was doing, but he had no customers at that moment.  There was one table of customers already seated and eating.  Guy 2 was putting together an order right in front of the 3 of us.  We were looking at the menu for a minute or so, but about 4 to 5 minutes passed before anyone acknowledged us.  We saw the line cook throw a large bag of frozen waffle fries from the cold storage to the countertop (fresh - never frozen?).  Finally Guy 2 took our order.  Then Guy 1 rang us up.  Bill was $48 including the 15% tip I left (which sort of irks me - because nobody brings your meal to the table or waits on you - the staff does nothing more than a McDonalds employee does. I'm happy to leave (and usually at least) a 20% tip when wait staff does what they're supposed to do.)  These guys were nice enough, but both acted like they'd rather be somewhere else.  I then went to get my drink - and the floor between the soda fountain and the tea was completely sticky as if some kid had spilled a soda... but there were no kids inside and they had only been open 20 minutes.  Kinda gross... and inattentive especially considering Guy 1 wasn't doing anything for the first 4-5 minutes we were in the store, not to mention he was standing only 4 feet from the sticky mess.  ??  I might expect that at Peter Piper... but not at a place like this.  Anyway, again, our food was at least tasty.  And then my buddy (who I was taking to lunch), unprovoked, made a comment at the table to the effect of \"the staff sure isn't helping this place at all\".  Which is my entire point... there are too many restaurants in this area to choose from to spend that sort of money and feel like the staff could care less if you were even there.  I was hoping they'd have the staff ironed out 3 months into being opened.  I'll try again next month I guess.     Bottom line: good food, lousy staff.  Pork on a fork - you're soooo close to being my \"go-to\".",

No need for anything additional but worth trying! Fast, clean and family friendly.  I will bring my whole family here for sure. I think my young kids will love the many options!!!

    "text": "YUM! Our go-to BBQ place nearby closed recently so we've been on the hunt for smoked meat.   Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. The walls and front of the food line are covered in distressed wood that actually looks smoked itself. A nice touch! There are several tables for seating as well as a wood bench that runs the length of the dining room.  The menu has enough components that you will never run out of options. Hubby got a BBQ sampler with chicken, pork, and brisket. The chicken was his favorite. He chose rice and potato salad as his sides. I tried the brisket bowl on top of baked beans, topped with coleslaw. It was tasty but next time I'll order something on a tray. I'm a food separatist but I powered through and ate everything mixed together. I also ordered a side of Mac n cheese for $1.99.  Overall we were pleased with the meal and ambiance and we'll definitely be back!  Edited to add: four stars for food, the fifth added because of awesome customer service... and a clean bathroom that makes you feel as if you just walked into a saloon!",

Had the Salad with chicken on top, pretty good but they didn't seem to know what to put on it besides lettuce and chicken. Soft drink prices are insane, $2.25 and RC, no pepsi, no coke, I'll pass, at least they gave me a full size cup for water. Atmosphere is decent . I'll be back...4 stars.",

Just like the original, the ribs are incredible, the pulled pork is smoked to perfection and the Mac and cheese is simply addictive. Can't wait to have them cater my next event. And what makes them even better... they are locally owned and operated. Simply the best BBQ in the valley.",

    "text": "I give this place a 3 stars because of their customer service.  I've been to this place a few times, the food it's generally pretty good, the only thing I didn't like is their ribs; they are on the dry/burnt side. However, the rest of their meats and sides are really good. Meats are juicy, well portioned. The sides are homemade (most of them), my favorite are the mac n cheese and the macaroni salad. Their barbecue sauces are savory, spicy, tangy...really good.  The reason for the 3 stars: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. I ordered once through UBER eats, and the person at the counter messed up, and did not give one of the dinner plates to the driver. When the driver arrived at my house, I asked for the other plate, and he said; \"I specifically asked the girl if that was it, and she rudely replied \"yes, that's it\". So, while the driver was still at my house, I called the restaurant, I was placed on hold for a while, and finally they answered, the man I talked to said they gave everything to the driver, that he personally had given it to him, and to contact UBER. Luckily, the driver stayed w/ me for the entire talk, and he jumped in, told him that a GIRL was the one that had given him the order, not him, and to not lie about it; that's when the guy at the restaurant got nervous, and put the girl on the phone. The girl, still being rude, told the driver...ok, your order is here, come get it. UBER driver went to go get my order, brought it back, and told me that he was not paid for this extra drive, and that the \"kids working there had showed him some attitude\". Later that day, I got a call from the manager at the restaurant who apologized and offered me some credit for my next visit. Last week, I went in to use the credit, the restaurant was EMPTY, no customers, and 2 people behind the counter did not greet me, smile, and just stared at me. I approached them, and told him that I was there to get some credit for something that had happened in the past, still, nothing from them, no apology, nothing to make this experience better, one of them went to the back to check for my name on their list, and when he came back, he asked, \"what do you want?\". Again, the attitude was horrible, they were not rude, but honestly, no enthusiasm, I walked out of there feeling depressed. Again, the food was delicious, but the customer service is a disaster. I truly hope the owner/manager pays attention to that, because it could really bring down a restaurant...a GOOD restaurant.",

The pulled chicken was dark meat & very tasty to my surprise. The brisket & pulled pork both was dry & bland. With all the meat a dinner roll would have been nice, but no. Baked beans were yummy & peppery. Mac&Cheese was a bit grainy. Workers were really nice, but a bit slow for the lunch time crowd.",

In Texas where I came from, BBQ there is so much better and they give you all the hot rolls you want!!  Since moving back to Phoenix we had tried other BBQ places here and they were better!  Well tried this place one more time 5-1 -17. Most likely will never come back! Had their pulled pork sandwich and the bun was very stale and hard! Pulled pork was terrible and had so many hard pieces in it. Had a side salad and it just came with lettuce and a couple of cherry tomatoes with ranch dressing that tasted like it was old!

We ordered 10lbs each of the pulled pork and shredded chicken, which was all very juicy and delicious. We also got the large pans of Mac n cheese, cole slaw, and potato salad. Our order was ready for pickup just before our scheduled pick up time which was great, and the helpful guys carried it all out to my car and made sure to place the cole slaw on top so it didn't get hot. Great customer service!! They are also on fivestars, so with that big order I also earned a couple free meals and I've redeemed one so far- the brisket with some Mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. The brisket was AMAZING!!!! Better than some of the \"best\" BBQ places in a couple cities that I have tried! Was very tender juicy and flavorful and just melted in my mouth. The sweet potato fries were also perfect, crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. Sauces were also very delicious! Will definitely be back, order again for catering, and recommend to my friends. And a side note their bathroom was extremely clean and smelled good, lol! Thanks so much Pork on a Fork keep up the great w(p)ork!!!",

The food was packaged well and came with all the utensils we needed. Ordered the two meat option from the catering menu - pulled pork, pulled chicken and two sides, mac and cheese and coleslaw. Came with three types of BBQ sauce. Everything was delicious - it was a big hit in the office and a welcome break from the typical sandwich platters. Would most definitely recommend Pork on a Fork and will be using for future lunches! (Side note: order extra mac n' cheese because it is amazing and will disappear quickly!)",

On the two visits..mind you two days apart because the food is excellent, the service was so awful! No hello when walking in the door, a girl behind the counter was rolling her eyes when I couldn't make up my mind...hey, c'mon, everything looks good, let me have a couple of seconds since I've never been here! Second visit, same greeting..i.e. no hello..okay, ordering my food and I mentioned that we were just here on Thursday and the food was so good we had to come back and got zero response from both people behind counter..I was waiting for a great glad to see you back but I got nothing, nada, zip, no response, not even as much as a smile.  Ok then, wow!  The food was great! Don't expect good service here only good food.",

    "text": "Love this place! Pork on a Fork has really stepped up their game. I had stopped going to their Deer Valley location when other options became available, but gave their new location a shot.  BBQ is going through a bit of a renaissance in the valley and it seems to be pushing everyone to do better. Pork on a Fork's brisket is way better than the last time I had it. This location features a quick, simple menu that gets you in and out quickly. Service is friendly, attentive, and fast.  I can only comment on the sides I've had which are the waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and cornbread muffins--all of which are very good.   Their Brisket sandwich is great and their sausage is a great add on. Good quality BBQ fast. Can't complain about that.",

Ordered ahead and when we got there they said they accidentally sold the last of the ribs and forgot about our order.   Took forever after we paid, around 30 minutes.   Started out with a bad taste in our mouth, and then the food was just ok.   Although, we didn't get to try the ribs so not sure on those.",

Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and they were out of a couple sides so I ended up with mac and cheese and waffle fries. Everything was pretty decent. The side containers for the beans and mac and cheese are pretty small while you get a pretty large portion of waffle fries, not sure why the disparity between the two. The sandwich was also pretty well loaded with meat and there didn't appear to be a lot of fat or funk on it, which is nice. The various BBQ sauces on the table were a good touch.",

The pork is flavorful, moist, tender, expertly cooked and seasoned and paired with a delicate bread.  I added Mac n cheese and it was also wonderful!!  I just came from Charlotte and it rivals the best from there!  Don't let the strip mall facade fool you.  If someone gives this place negative good reviews they are stupid....

I called to place my order and Kylie was very helpful in answering all of my questions. We ended up going with 2 of the extra large family platters. Those are great because you get 4 different meats, so there's something for everyone. All of the meats and sauces were delicious! My guests ate every bite so the food was a huge hit! Great customer service and food, highly recommend!",

Went here for the first time this past weekend, did the chicken sandwich with sides of potato salad and baked beans. I apparently missed the memo that the mac and cheese is to die for, so now I must return just for that! Not the cheapest, but I suppose same price range as somewhere such as chipotle. Not fast food, but not a full on site down fancy restaurant. Meat was very good. Wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad, not sure what it was about it. Not terrible, but will not get it again. Cute decor, friendly staff, and a little too good of a location. I shall return.",

All the sauces for your meats are at each table. Our table had the zippy mustard, smoky & tangy BBQ, and mild & sweet BBQ,  My brother's and my favorite was the zippy mustard; I also liked the sweet & mild BBQ.  Note: they put the fries in the fryer after you order them so if you're super hungry and/or in a rush, you should avoid the fries. My dad had to wait a few mins for his waffle fries, and I waited quite a bit for my sweet potato fries (and a few still weren't fully cooked).  Verdict: will definitely be back!!",
