I don't want to judge this place too harshly on something that's not what the restaurant is all about but it's important for people seeking gluten free pizza to know. If I were them I wouldn't even carry this product at all. The dough is so flat and has a really weird after taste. Most places seem to use the same frozen rounds and they just don't cut it. I know GF will never replace pizza and there is only so much you can do but I really challenge this place to come up with a mix and bake fresh made pies. If I can do it in my home anyone can do it. The demand for GF alternatives is only growing and if you can have an edge on something like that it would set you apart from others. Maybe the owners should just try the GF crust and see what I mean. For having such amazing regular pizza they should at least try to put out a better quality product.",

    "text": "I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie.   My only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost!   All in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!",

    "text": "We normally just order take out from here and it's always very good, but since it was Valentine's day we decided to eat at the restaurant as a fun treat for my son. We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee.   When we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16\" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8\" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.  Drinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet. We had a coupon for two free cannolis. They were less than impressive and I was very happy they were free.  Overall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis, you will not be dissapointed.",

Everyone seems like they like their job here. The house salad is pretty basic,  but when you add the homemade Balsamic dressing, it is soo good. I have not tried anything else on the menu,  but I am certainly open and anticipating. Will Def go back, and if you love good pizza...then this is your spot.

He brought our pizza out and didn't light the candle to keep our pizza warm. He did refill our drinks and did do all you expect as far as getting what we need but it felt uncomfortable/awkward and all of us noticed it. It wasn't actually the fact that he didn't say anything, it was that we could just FEEL that attitude.  We all felt like we were experiencing the silent treatment.  LOL!  We have always had exceptional service and food each and every time we have been to NYPD but normally we dine at the Chandler location and so maybe it is just this location.

    "text": "To whom it may concern: I've visited this excellent restaurant many times with my husband and family and until today have always considered the experience amazing in every regard!  Today I was disappointed.  I came in alone and sat at the bar as I was going shopping at Fry's next door and just wanted a quick bite.  I ordered a slice and 6 wings.  The food was excellent as always, and the service was near perfect except for one huge faux pa... As I ate, I was transfixed by an episode of Bones.  I hardly took my eyes of the screen.  I had forgotten my cell phone at home, and as I was dining alone watching the TV enhanced my dining experience.  I was the only person sitting at the bar for some time, and was about 75% done with my meal when an older guy came and also sat at the bar.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed him glance over at me a few times as I watched the Bones episode.  Soon after that our server, Fabienne came back, and this man whispered something to her.  To my utter amazement Fabienne said something to the effect of, \"Oh sure Sir, I can do that!\" She proceeded to change the channel to a sports game without even glancing over at me to ask if I was done watching, or if I minded.  If she would have asked I would have given my \"ok,\" but I was offended that she didn't even acknowledge me.  I was stunned!  I bill was $10.52, and I normally would have left a $3 tip on this small amount, because I respect and value the hard work servers do, but this time I left a $2 tip.  I didn't say anything to her as I felt she knew exactly what she had done, and didn't care, because she held the man in higher regard than me a lone female.  I know there's a misconception out there that single women don't tip that well, but her mistake is in assuming, and holding another person in higher regard due to gender, ethnicity, or I don't know what.  She should have considered the fact that I do come in with my husband, and/or family 90% of the time, and we always treat our servers like they are our own kids, and tip well.  A little disappointed today...",

Thank U 4 having/offering these #1Derful options 4 those of us who r'nt carnivores as there wouldn't b much 4 us 2 order 2 patronize ur eatery!!     I'm not a fan of pizza dough but their's is on another scale that I actually eat the crust 2 (which I don't do w/ other pizza). We had/shared between us Spinach salad (sans the bacon), Caprese, Spinach/Artichoke dip, & Zucchini sticks were all Absolutely AHHhmazing as usual but our main reason 4 coming: Veganizza & Pizza Bianca we had r PERFECTION 2 die 4... seriously Exceptional in flavors & texture!!!     On previous visits we've had the Soho salad pizza, greek salads, Eggplant & the Chelsea chopped salad (minus the bacon)... all So Delicious & especially luv the salad pizza concept, pls keep this 2!!      We usually like 2 sit in the outside section because my guilty pleasure is watching any of the birds flitting around the bushes & scavenging 4 crumbs which I someXs 'accidentally' drop in my occasional clumsiness. Also the service has always been impeccable whenever we've gone which is truly appreci8ed & a very integral part of the dining experience!     We luv the cannolis/kisses & we've had the tiramisu in the past which was AWESOME 2 (but not offered on menu anymore)? We have yet 2 try the limoncello cake but will save that in anticip8ion 4 our next visit. NYPD ROCKS & really hope they keep these Veg~head/Gluten~Free faves of ours so we can continue our business w/ this establishment!!!",

    "text": "We have been going to this location since 2012. Our first visit was uneventful.  The waiter was horrible. He took a long time to take our order. The food was good. We had decided not to return after that. I must say that the food was good so we decided to go back. Again we received bad service. In March of 2012 my husband was diagnosed  with cancer . He had to go thru vigorous  treatment   and had to follow  a strict diet. He wanted to eat pizza before his next battle of test. Despite my protest we went back. That was a great decision.  We got there and was seated.  We sat and we're talking among ourselves. Our waitress came up and ask how we were doing. She took our order. She was very friendly.  I didn't think much of it. We ate and left.  As my husband went through  his battle  all he wanted was NYPD pizza. I promised him pizza when he was able to eat it. A month went by and we returned.  We got the same waitress. Again she was kind . I asked her for her name. Fabienne  she said but likes to go by Fabbi. We went back and she was not there but we stood anyway. The server that day was blah. We were going grocery shopping one day and I went in to see if she was there.  By chance she was so we decided  to stay. The day Fabbi no longer works there is the day we stop going. She is a great fabulous  person, server and does wonders for the restaurant.  If she's not there we will not stay. After all my babbling all I wanted to say is: Fabbi is a caring , loving , funny person. She makes you feel comfortable and  always makes my bad day better. Sincerely  The Guebaras",

I specifically go out of my way, passing 3 other pizza joints, not just because the pizza is really good but because service is impeccable. I typically sit at the bar and have to say each bartender that waits on me has always been courteous, friendly and quick on my order, always delivered with a smile. I highly recommend NYPD on Camelback for the relaxing yet fun atmosphere. If you're looking for great pizza and a nice place to relax, you will not be disappointed.  Not sure of the couple of negative reviews on here but apparently they have nothing better to do than whine. Speaking of, they have a great selection wine too.",

    "text": "I have lived in the valley for 4 years now and have tried stupid amounts of pizza joints except NYPD until last weekend. I was watching my friends dogs and went to get some lunch and wanted to try NYPD since I have heard good things. It was midday on a Saturday and I was sat instantly in a booth and given a menu.  I ordered a \"My 'Za\" 8\" pepperoni and a order of garlic knots. The knots were nothing special and I assume they bought them from Frys next door as you can tell they were pre-frozen from the slight rubbery texture BUT they were still good.  The pizza was great, the crust is my favorite as it has the perfect blend of crisp and soft. Alot of places in the valley are one extreme or the other.  I literally had 3 people waiting on me for some reason but my main waitress (Stephanie?) was great and when my meal was done and I paid, the Manager (I assume) approached me about it being my first time eating there and he gave me a discount coupon for a free desert on the next visit, nothing fancy but a well accepted gesture and alot of businesses could learn from this small gesture of customer interaction.  All-in-all, I enjoyed the experience and will eat there again.",

For some time now a young man named Adem has been my server and is wonderful.  I eat most of my meals out and I can tell you he is the best.  Adem knows the menu inside and out so he can help with offering up vegetarian or Vegan items.  He greets you as you enter and is so fast at assisting you with a drink and a menu.  He checks back often and is so attentive that he knows just the right time to bring over the check.  Adem is a huge asset to NYPD.  I wanted to make sure someone knows how great he is.  I managed domestic and international customer service for a large international company for 37 years and have now retired.  If I was still working I would steal Adem away as his skills would be valued at any company.  Thanks Adem for always being the best....Ray",

It's just around the corner from where I live so from time to time, usually during football season for mnf, is what I love coming here for if it's just me to lay low and watch the game minus the company you find in a typical sports bar crowd. The food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I'm mostly a beer guy, but here I actually will spring for some wine once in a while. I'm also normally a pizza guy. I mean I really, really like pizza, but here I've gotten pretty much everything else but that, simply because I already know the pizza is good, but so are the other pastas or sandwiches they have, which are slightly cheaper. My favorite so far is their roast beef sandwich. I've always found the waiters to be good and accommodating and I even like the patrons that will come in, which are either families in the dining area or people just sitting at the bar drinking a glass of wine while they wait for their take out order. Never found it to be too crowded, or too loud, or otherwise obnoxious. All of which is why I really like the place. Usually during the course of a game I'll order a pasta or sandwich and a couple beers and the bill will be less than $20 so that's pretty good.",

Pre-made??? Let me tell you, they heat that shit right up in their oven and its perfect! I usually pig out here and get three slices, either the plain cheese (so simple and so good), the pepperoni/jalapeno or the tomato ricotta white pizza. Oh yeah, the sicilian style pizza is awesome, but that one you have get made fresh to order. Way better that way. You can really taste the NYC water in the dough with that one! If you enjoy a good Greek Salad this place has one of the best. The dressing is so damn good.  I have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though.",

NYPD pizza has both I looked at a few other pizza restaurants before ordering from here. The other places got good food marks but bad service reviews we are currently staying in a hotel in unfamiliar with the area in the process of ordering online by the way very convenient and easy I called the restaurant to ask a question about an item Leo answered the phone very friendly great service after placing my order within a few minutes the manager from the restaurant called me because he was unsure about an ad on that I had and wanted to confirm he had it correct. to me that goes above and beyond instead of just assuming you called me to check it out the food was delivered within the 60 minute time frame I was given the driver was very friendly and most importantly had change we ordered pizza salad zucchini sticks and cannolis all in all after tip $42 yes a little pricey but great service and amazing food. you definitely get what you pay for here very much pleased and looking forward to ordering again thank you in YPD pizza for a great experience in Phoenix",

He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!).",

Yeah I'm no twig by far and I like food, actually I love good food. Anyway my NY friends & kids rave this is the best pizza ,so I go give it a try. Hey what can I say I ordered two different slices and ate them both! It was awesome pizza much to my surprise, since these kids eat frozen pizza, and I'm skeptical that any pizza served by the slice and individually topped can be palatable. Ok I admit I'm wrong! I'm stuck up about these things. NYPD has great pizza I can walk in order two slices however I want them, not go broke and not eat pizza for an endless number of meals and wear it my thighs and my azzie for the next month or two! I'm happy.",

I say hearty because it's a bit thicker than the typical NY pizza with a thicker layer of toppings but it's not as thick as a normal pizza either. It was perfect for me.   We got \"Da Works\", which is basically a combo pizza but it's very rich in flavor with fresh ingredients. We also got the \"Kahuna\", which is their Hawaiian and that was amazing as well. Don't forget to order some Garlic bread and wings as well as beer and wine!   The atmosphere is very chill and New York like. Service was excellent and I am definitely going back.",

The bartender greeted me and checked in my order. I seen her actually holding a wine glass to the light to check cleanliness. That was awesome to see!   The guy that was bagging my food was super nice, and checked for extra sauces.   Food tasted great. I do think there prices are a little on the higher side but worth it none the less!   Great lunch specials from 11-4!!  Edit: I was pretty pissed all you get is two lousy celery sticks but the food is too damn good to deduct a star!",

Anyone that's enjoyed a slice in the tri-state area understands how important pizza is to New Yorkers. (Sorry New Jersey and surrounding states. I'm from New York!)  You can walk into almost any pizza joint, ask for a slice and be happy with your two buck piece of cheesy gooey heaven on (slightly) crunchy dough. No need for production value to enjoy good pizza. Moving to the west side of the U.S. I don't miss the cold weather, but I do miss pizza.  CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WOULD BE PROUD I've found good pizza last night. No, GREAT pizza. (Well, technically I did nothing. My date did. But he did well! Thank you Yelp!)  ORDER | PICKUP Our pie had pepperoni, sausage and basil. \"We\" ordered online and the pie was ready for pick-up at the scheduled time. The staff was delightfully polite and cheerful. Cute place inside, filled with booths and tables. I like that there is plenty of bar space to cozy up to as well. We had no time to enjoy a drink as our pie was ready to go!  TRAVELS WELL I can't begin to tell you the dismay of traveling with something that smells so heavenly in a car. (\"Will it be ok?\" \"Can I scarf a slice before we get there?\" and so on. But we had to hit BevMo. Priorities!)  With glee I can report NYPD Pizza travels well. My palate was BFF with the two slices I scarfed down. (Yup, no lady like behavior there.)  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS + Not greasy + Not salty + Crunchy dough + Added bonus: Microwaves well the next day.  I'm dreaming of my next visit!",

We chatted for a while about our upcoming trip to Hawaii and he shared a couple of his favorite places with us. It was so nice to see the personal attention to his guests, as the restaurant was busy and he was stopping by many tables but it wasn't just the quick touch-and-go \"Hi-how's-your-meal-okay-great-bye!\"  Additionally, our server (I think his name was Justin but I could be wrong - light hair and thick-rimmed glasses) was fantastic and so friendly.

NYPD's pizza is crisp and refreshing, a phrase which I've never used to describe pizza before.  Isn't this type of food supposed to weigh you down and make you swear you'll start your diet tomorrow?  The beer selection is great, with several local choices.  A small pizza can easily feed two people, maybe three if you're looking for a light meal.  We got Da Works, which is their version of a supreme, but looking over the remaining scraps of the tables around us, other pizza styles were just as enjoyable.  Other Yelpers have complained about the service, but it was spectacular in my opinion.  Maybe they've made some changes recently.  The vast majority of the waiters looked like firefighters (okay, that's probably the uniform, probably supposed to look like the police, plus the fact that Arizona people look slightly different from the Miamians I'm used to), and they were super friendly and on top of things despite the increasing number of customers.  The host was obviously gunning to be a waiter, and I have no doubt he'll make it soon - great personality and motived to boot.  Wish I had caught his name. I'll make sure to do so during our next visit.",

The restaurant is tucked into the corner of a shopping plaza on Camelback & 20th St, right next to Fry's.   There are a few different options for dining here. You can order at the counter for a grab and go option. I saw quite a few people come in an pick up orders that they called in. They also offer delivery. Of course there's a dine in option as well. They have a small bar where you can sit, as well as indoor and patio seating too. After coming here twice, I've had an overwhelming feeling that the tables inside are in desperate need of reorganization. It feels a bit too spread out in there.   The service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.  They have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers.   As for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG! Not that I'm complaining, I love leftovers. I want to try the dessert because they look incredible and they seem to have a variety of options.  I'm so happy to have a great pizza place like this nearby and I plan to return in the future.",

Crap happens, I understand that, so I immediately call.  The manager said he would refund the card we paid with for the cost of the food forgotten. (chicken on a salad).  So.....not make it right and bring the chicken?  So now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch?  But **free** iceberg lettuce.  I asked \"that's what we do?\"  And yes, that's what they do.  I remarked that I needed to get off the phone so I could go order her lunch and they said \"ok\".  OK. I just would have expected our order to be delivered in full..eventually.  But not at all?",

Dominos is actually better and $10 less than my overpriced $32 pizza/meatball sandwich meal.  This has solidified my opinion that the best pizza in Phoenix is still Spinatos.    The NYPD meatballs had a taste that could not be recognized; if these are meatballs, then they should be renamed spicy bready dough balls.  The pizza was a little warm when I got it and certainly not thin crust.  So many pizza places lie about \"thin crust\" that the next time I'm going to ask how thin?  The cheesecake was actually the best part of it; next time, skip the pizza and just order dessert for lunch!",

We are always pleased with this location but our visit on 9/1/15 was truly the BEST.  Our server Michelle was amazing!  Super enthusiastic and provided excellent service.  She acknowledged it was a b-day celebration and said happy birthday to the birthday girl numerous times throughout our visit.  She made sure we knew about the complimentary dessert and of course we took advantage of that.  :-) I would have to say this is not the cheapest pizza in town but it is REALLY GREAT tasting and they have a great happy hour.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Fields salad.  Delicious!!   Side note to management..... our group (all ladies) did stop going to your restaurant for a brief time due to the homeless/disadvantaged people approaching us and begging for money every time we were in the parking lot.  It appears this unfortunate situation has been rectified as we saw security patrolling the lot and not a single person approached us for $$.",

We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused.   Finally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order.   We split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber.   We were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared.   We won't be coming back.",

I contacted the corporate office for NYPD to see if they could assist with a birthday surprise I was planning by creating  a pizza that spelled out \"Happy Birthday\" in pepperoni.  Heather, at their corporate office, was quick to respond and so helpful with connecting me with their Camelback location to see if creating the pizza was something their team could do.  Additionally, she made sure to stay connected and confirmed the day before that the delivery was going to go through the next day.  Torri at the Camelback location immediately got on board once Heather connected us and walked me through the ordering process.  She and her team, specifically the cooks, Luis and Justin , went above and beyond in delivering the birthday surprise.  In addition to the pizza, they included bonus items -- a birthday cheesecake and garlic knots -- to ensure the birthday celebrant knew the Camelback team was celebrating his birthday with him.  I can't say enough good things about the excellent cooperation and service we received from NYPD corporate and Team Camelback.  Their small gesture and willingness to go the extra mile really took this simple birthday surprise from \"kind of cool\" to \"really awesome\"!",

Then my server, Roger (not sure of the name, but that's what shows on the receipt), gave me cheesecake and strawberries and chocolate syrup, ON the House. Another food to die for. Their cheesecake was perfectly made. Didn't really care for the chocolate syrup, but who can beat a free dessert? All in all, food was amazing and their service was excellent. Would definitely come back when I crave for pizza and cheesecake again",

I normally wouldn't bring it up because they fixed it but because of how great they handled it thought I'd share here it goes.... they overcooked the calzone a bit but I never knew the waitress said she noticed it and requested a new one. they did such a good job making sure they replaced the order before I was even notified there was an issue a new one was being made.They also gave me something to snack on until it came. Now that's customer service, that's caring about what you put on the table!! The manager even came by to check on us and make sure everything was going well. He assured us the new calzone was on the way. Fresh salad, yummy food, and attentive staff... AMustGo #yummy And THEY HAVE MILITARY DISCOUNT 5 stars",

    "text": "I was very excited to finally come to NYPD because I have been hearing about it for a very long time. There was 4-6 tables in the restaurant which was not very busy at 7pm on a Thursday, so I assumed my order would be completed quickly. Unfortunately I was wrong. After 20 minutes of waiting I asked the bartender if she could check on my food. 10 minutes later I walked up to the counter myself to ask what was going on. I could see that part of my order was bag with my name on it sitting under a heat lamp, and the manager Jenn, let me know that my pizza had been done for a while and was on top of the oven. I let her know that this was my first time in and needless to say I was not impressed at this point. She asked me what I would like to do and I let her know that all I wanted was to make sure that I had fresh food to take. Jen had my order remade and record-breaking time and I can happily say that I was also gifted with a coupon for the next pizza to be on the house. This is a prime example of what customer service should look like an NYPD pizza should be proud to have a manager like Jenn at the helm of that restaurant. A True team is when one member may Fumble, while another picks up the ball and runs in for the winning score! Great job by NYPD and fantastic time! I will always speak very highly of this establishment!",

The staff is very accommodating.   As a native from NYC I can be pretty picky when it comes to my pizza. I really enjoy a good slice of NY style pizza folded in half loaded with toppings and NYPD never fails me.   NYPD serves up an authentic pie with just the right amount of seasonings, a tasty blend of oregano and basil. Topped with a  fabulous sauce and NYPD  never scrimps on the toppings. Their pizza's are loaded. Not to mention, as an extra bonus, a NYPD pizza holds up as a great leftover, even when reheated unlike many other pizzas west of the city.  I have never been disappointed in an NYPD Pizza and will always go back for a slice or two!",

I've passed it up for years because of out of the way location.  But, finally the radio commercials convinced me to try.  I literally tried cold, on a whim, as I was driving around.  I didn't know the store's location or phone number, so dialed information to connect me.  The girl who took my order quoted me a price and a time my order would be ready.  She was kind enough to give me the corner the store was located.  The biggest negative was 2 slices of the medium pizza was burned.  The pizza was shown to me by the clerk, so I guess that's my fault for not catching it, but I'm surprised that the quality was not checked before reaching me.  Another thing that threw me were the sizes.  A medium is 16 not 14 as I assumed.  I ended up with 3 meals.  Fortunately the pizza heats up well.  I will say the pizza tasted good. The crust is light which I like.  And, the ingredients are of good quality.  I would not dissuade any one else from trying, but there wasn't enough of WOW factor here to bring me back.",

As we were about to leave, a uniformed police officer walked in. We wanted to cover his meal. This week, a PHX police officer was ambushed and died in the line of duty. I asked for the manager and told him we'd like to leave enough $ to cover his ticket along with gratuity. INSTEAD OF TAKING MY $, the manager said, \"I had already planned on covering his ticket. Whoever joins him, it's on us tonight.\" He thanked me for my offer, but said he had it covered. TOP NOTCH LEADERSHIP IN ACTION!

Sometimes slightly salty, depending on which toppings you go for, but in general a good crust, good toppings, nicely cooked and pleasantly presented.  At some point we became fans of the white pizza.  This one has no sauce on it, though they do toss on some spinich or tomatoes for color-- it's a toss up, I like it both ways.  This is not to say that their more traditional sauce-laden pizza isn't a fine choice as well.  And for those who have ever had a calzone from \"back east,\" we figured we would ask them if they could take their normal calzone and deep fry it, just like at Pizza Town, USA in my old home town of New Milford, NJ.  They were good enough to oblige us, but things went awry quickly.  Our theory was that the cook tried to bake the calzone before frying it, so we ended up with an oily glob-- kudos to them, though, for giving it a try.  When I go back to visit in Phoenix a stop at NYPD is always on the agenda.",

After browsing around Last Chance awhile I decided to grab some lunch before heading home.   Although their premade pizza's looked pretty good, I decided on the lunch size Louie Prima calzone. The wait would be about 20 minutes, so I went next door to Fry's for some quick grocery shopping.   I picked up my lunch and it just about killed me to smell it but not inhale it on the way home. As I finally sat down to eat it I was like a kid at Christmas! Every time I tore into the perfectly browned crust I found another treasure. Sliced tomatos, gobs of spinich and a load of my absolute favorite-ricotta cheese all mixed up with a fair share of mozzarella too! And of course the marinara sauce for dipping.  It was pretty messy to eat, but anything I eat usually ends up being messy and in my book: messy=good. I'm a fan!",

    "text": "My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....  The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.    So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!   Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!  Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!  This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!",

I like NYPD Pizza because you don't have to order pizza in order to have a good meal. The salads are great. My fave is the Chelsea Salad. The Italian Wedding Soup is also very good. The pastas are pretty good and I'm not really into tomato sauce.   The Pizza is okay. Yes, New Yorkers are going to hate on it and call it crap, but is it not?",

    "text": "Coda B. and I don't go out for pizza very often. This is for 2 reasons. 1. Coda likes Domino's. 2. I like, nay, LOVE mushrooms on pizza (among other delicious vegetable toppings) while Coda prefers his pizza be served with toppings that, at one point, had a face. I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge.   NYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14\" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.     It is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve \"New York\" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.  Four stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet! I used to order from a Chinese delivery place solely because they gave you little trinkets with your order, and I do order happy meals every so often so yeah, I guess you can say I'm a fan of gifts with food. So thanks for the magnet, New York Pizza Department. I will be back.",

When we got there the host seemed annoyed and practically threw our menus on the table. He Sucked!   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen wings and the Philly Cheese steak pizza. First off the Wings were fantastic, although not as spicy as we anticipated. The wings came with sliced jalapenos scattered over the top of them, but it was just a psychological thing to make you think they're spicier. The Philly pizza was sub par. It was low on cheese and some what under cooked. There was still water from the meat running of the sides, basically making the crust soggy.   Our waiter was very generous, unfortunately I forgot her name. She changed my perspective of the service.  For some strange reason, the host was still giving me the stink eye...I think he liked my girlfriend or something or may be just hated his job. lol      Overall, I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York! By the way did I mention I don't like police. Except a friend of mine who just graduated the academy. Congratulations! Now keep me safe from other police.",

Hence, apply this rationale and you know the secret to NYPD.  Great za in Phoenix, AZ???  You bet!  Pizza starts with the crust.  Without great crust, you can't have great za.  But...if you make your crust with the exact mineral content of water from Yonkers, NY....you have a great crust!  Top it off with a spicy (not sweet) sauce, and moz that is of good quality and melt, and abracadabra....there it is.  Way to go NYPD...pride in za making....and real ovens too!  Conveyor belt pizza is crapola, meant for California.  I give it my 2nd highest 'sausage and pepperoni' rating, from the NY Pizza Guy.",

    "text": "How disappointing.  I have been a long-time customer over the years, but the last two trips to this restaurant have me questioning whether I should ever go back.    TERRIBLE trip #1:  I went with my family, a total of three of us.  My order was simple enough, a built-to-order calzone with three ingredients.  Three consecutive screw-ups later and I still did not have a calzone.  Another family member did not get what she asked for during round one, either.  No manager ever approached us.  Bad trip #2:  Just got back from having dinner there 20 minutes ago.  As soon as we were seated, a waiter looked at the hostess who was barely starting to walk away from our table and audibly said, \"You're killing me...Are you going to seat ANOTHER table in my area, too?\"  There were two of us.  Ended up that he was not our waiter.  Our waiter took a while to get to us, then another long while to get our waters to us.  Finally, I ordered a small salad from the salad portion of the menu, and my dinner partner ordered a sandwich exactly as the menu described it.  Neither one of us made modifications to our orders.    40 minutes later, my salad had been brought out, but no sandwich.  The waiter seemed very preoccupied with every other table except ours.  Other waiters came out with food and were asking us if we had ordered the items, all of which we had not.  In the meantime, other waiters and waitresses were going up to our waiter and telling him that he had food and drinks ready to be served from the bar and kitchen.  After another 15 minute wait, he brought the sandwich and simply said, \"Sorry, we have a new cook.\"    When I got the check, I saw that a small salad and a basic sandwich amounted to $15.  After reviewing the menu, $15 seemed to be a huge bargain compared to the price of a pizza or pasta.  Not that $15 is a lot to spend on dinner, but had we gone elsewhere we would have received more food for the price.    I will not be back anytime soon.",

I must have walked/driven past this place at least 200 times without a second thought of going in until last week. The joke is on me.  Taking the sister, her hubby and the kiddies for dinner in Central Phoenix and finding a restaurant we would all like was a challenge and thanks to Oregano's having a 2 hour Saturday night wait - which is par for the course - we ended up here.  NYPD Pizza and a 20 minute wait?  We're sold.  Another must was a TV for the NFL playoffs which they showed in the small bar area. As for the interior, it very much felt like a neighborhood cafe with the interior brick facade and stringed lights criss-crossing the room.  Well, NYPD Pizza delivered and then some.  They liked their pizza, minestrone and garlic bread knot thingies.  The girls got kids sized spaghetti and meatball, a coloring paper menu and crayons.  I needed to overload on carbs for a big race the next day so I ordered pasta.  My baked ziti with sausage was absolutely delicious.  Having had that same dish at Oregano's, it is much better than what they serve.  If you're not a fan of cheese you probably won't like the ziti at NYPD.  But since I love cheese, it hits the spot.  I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference in water in the taste of their dough, but apparently the fact that they import their water from Brooklyn is a big deal.  Kinda pretentious if you ask me, but hey, I like the extra effort and I liked the fact that I did not get arrested.",

The servers present are helpful and friendly and replaced our wings when we served the wrong flavor and completely took them off our bill for the inconvenience. The beer is cheap, cold, and the wings are good but the pizza needs more crunch it was way too soggy.",

When my husband and I first started coming here for lunch /dinner they played Rat Pack music and at night it looked just like a New  York style pizza place with patio lights hanging from the ceiling inside and between the lights and the music it felt like you really were in New York back in the good old days having a pie!  I really hope they bring that atmosphere back because it was part of the charm of this place and we loved it so much!   GREAT Pizza!!!",

The first time I brushed it off as a bad night but now after several times I am truly beyond disappointed. They have sent my cold pizza, forgot items and even when I specifically mentioned/reminded them.... they still failed to bring it. The food is more expensive than most pizza joints, which makes sense because of their quality.... but after so many mistakes how can you continue to keep paying for bad service (especially for loyal customers)?   After posting this, the manager actually reached out to me personally and apologized for my recent experiences. He then rectified the situation and I was incredibly impressed. I have since be back a few times and each time I have had a great experience. Nypd has redeemed themselves in my book and I am changing my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars. Thank you Nypd, you guys are the type of company others should strive to be like!",

Not your ordinary fried cheese sticks. You get slabs of fresh mozzarella coated in a delicious breadcrumb mixture then deep fried. For main course we got the Quattro Formaggi (4 cheese) pizza.

    "text": "Coming from the Bay Area, I thought everything at NYPD is cheap and a great deal, but more importantly, it was tasty. For three people, we ordered 6 cheesy garlic knots, 6 boneless Hell's Kitchen wings, a half size of the spinach artichoke dip, a large spinach salad, and a small BBQ chicken pizza. The same meal back home would've cost at least 50% more, and that's a conservative guess. We arrived at lunchtime on Saturday and the restaurant was pretty empty. There's a construction project going on in the parking lot so it wasn't super clear to an out-of-towner like me that it was even open, but I was still surprised it wasn't more crowded. Our server, Justin, was polite and attentive, without being overbearing. Props to him!   The only thing that I found not quite up to par was the garlic knots. I did enjoy them because chewy carbs + cheese is my favorite food combination, but I didn't really taste any garlic. The spinach artichoke dip was pretty mild, and the bread (I think it was pizza dough?) that came with it was delicious. They weren't skimpy on the salad toppings as it was absolutely loaded! I didn't have any of the wings, but my husband seemed pleased. By the time the pizza arrived, I had more or less filled up on the appetizers, but I had a couple of slices and was also pleased. It was nice and cheesy with a well-seasoned crust, although I feel like it could've had more of the toppings.   NYPD is an absolute gem and I will definitely come back next time I'm in town!",

We said it is okay, not to worry. The manager came over a few seconds later and apologized for not having the Tabasco and said he had sent someone to get it. Two minutes later someone delivered a new bottle to our table. Even though the experience was rare for us, I have a feeling that is the way this restaurant does business as usual.",

It was our first time being there,  I had a slice of the the Buffalo Chicken and one of the Pepperoni and Jalapeno,  He had 2 slices of the Spinach.  First off, these slices are Huge!! I would have been better off only having one slice, but they were so delicious!  They had 80's music playing while we were there and I looved it!! So far, great place, great food, great atmosphere... however, the only reason for not giving it another star, is because upon ordering and paying, they gave me a number to put on the table.  You'd think that would  be so they knew which table to bring the food to, but this wasn't the case.  The lady who brought our pizza out, just stood there, confused, she looked over the dining room, turned back around and went back into the kitchen... then she came back out, looked at all the tables and diners again, then went back to the kitchen still holding our plates.  I could see that she asked someone which table the order belonged to, twice! and when she came back out the third time, she started asking random tables if it was their order, I called to her and asked if they were with the toppings we'd ordered, and she said yes.  The place was busy, but not crazy busy. Perhaps it was just an off day for the server or maybe she was new, but what was the point of giving me the number if they weren't even going to use it?",

    "text": "Went to @NYPD_Pizza for the first time tonight, because I had a coupon for a free entree.  Now, let me make it clear, I was an idiot, and I didn't print the coupon, because it clearly stated you could merely show it to your server from your phone.  So I did that. And because I did, I didn't read \"the fine print\", which clearly stated what exactly you were entitled to. The coupon: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FtuIS&s=1adc8ba26fa0c8f9a7c3ea0de6f75a1da1530b41b5361cd95bfb6a2701c410aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">goo.gl/tuIS</a>  So after we had placed our order, I looked at the coupon again, and noticed the listing of what was included in the entree selection. Feeling a case of caveat emptor, I searched out our server, and informed her of my mistake.  Her response was fantastic; she said what we had ordered already (shells florentine) would be probably be ok, but she would verify. She did indeed check, and they claimed that since neither I nor they caught until well after the order was placed (it was only about 5 or 10 mins...) they would go ahead and make the adjustment on my check.  That's customer service, beyond and above. I fully expected to have to change my order, or pay full price for the shells, and would not have felt that it were anyone's fault but my own.  The food was pretty tasty. Along with the shells, we ordered the Brooklyn Family Style pizza, which had pepperoni, sausage, and fresh basil.  The shells were pretty good, but nothing phenomenal.  The basil aroma that accompanied the arrival of the pie was wonderful! The sausage volume was a bit sparse, but the pizza was delicious, and I would recommend it.  It was a beautiful night, so we sat on the patio. The table that we were at had a slight ant problem, but once I cleared them, they didn't return.  Our server was a bit overwhelmed, but overall I think she did a decent job, and I made sure I showed my appreciation for her efforts.  I may back, but only if I were in the area.",

    "text": "35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.  I guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, \"Unique like a Brooklyn accent.\" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, \"Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.\")  The person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon.   After we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.  FINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.  I would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.\"  *** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server.",

The restaurant was not busy in any way but instead of seating me, I was asked to go up front and order then sit anywhere I would like.  When the cashier finally got done looking at something her co worker thought was funny, I placed my order then sat down across the way so they could see where I sat.  While waiting for my order the same cashier came up to me asking what I was doing in the restaurant sitting at a table. I told her \"I ordered a pizza from you a few minutes ago and waiting to eat it here\".  Eventually it was brought out to me in a \"to go\" box, not served in a way as if I would be dining in.  I told them that it would be fine, I was too hungry and bothered to ask them for anything else.  After I started to eat my food, they decided to sit down a small family with a few young/loud children at the table two feet away from me.  Again, it was not busy, they had the entire restaurant to seat them that did not have to be right next to someone else already upset with them. Wait, how did they even get seated? When I walked in they wouldn't seat me!!  So needless to say, major fail and will choose somewhere else next time I am near that location.",

But it also is topped with almonds, bacon, cheese and a creamy dressing to die for.  I usually save room for a 14\" pizza that is split between my husband and I.  I can still eat half, even with the salad and several toppings.  The price is not bad, but the food is good!  There is an option for a 5 topping pizza for $17.00.

Once I moved here, I ate NYPD so much they started to know me by my prefer lol.  I've had several things in f there menu...pizza, wings, salad, subs and have never been disappointed.  I actually had to take a break from eating it because I was starting to burn myself out.  My husband is not a huge fan of pizza (I know that's crazy) but he really likes NYPD.  Specifically he loves the light crispy doughy crust.   I hosted a game night and opted for NYPD since I hadn't had it in a while and it did not disappoint.  The Brooklyn Family is my favorite and it was a smash at my gathering. I'm always surprised that many Phoenicians still haven't had NYPD. The only cons are that it's a little expensive  and some locations are better than others.  You will early spend $40-$50 to feed 4 to 5....that's a lot for pizza.  Upside is that the pizza is so delicious the prices makes it worth it.  I save NYPD for special pizza occasions!",

Toppings are always fresh and a lot of items here are house-made (including the most delicious ranch dressing you've ever had).  From 11-3 they have a lunch combo with 2 slices (from an 18\" pie) plus a drink for a little over $8 after tax.  I eat a lot and it easily fills me up.  Great way to spend your lunch hour!  Easy 5 stars for the food.  Service can vary a bit from location to location, but this location is pretty solid so I'd go 4-4.5 stars on it.  You won't be disappointed here.

I placed an order ahead of time for a 16\" medium size pizza with three toppings (Ham, Jalapeno & Pineapple). Pretty simple pizza to make if you ask me. I was told the pizza would be ready in 30 minutes. So I showed up 40 minutes later to ensure the pizza would be ready and I would not have to wait. Upon arrival we were told the pizza was not ready yet and that it and would be an additional 10-15 minutes longer. We asked to make sure the pizza was the correct size & toppings on the pizza were correct as well and we were told it was (as the employee rolls her eyes at us for asking). Then we receive the pizza and double check to make sure it's right and yet again it was NOT. How hard is it to simply listen to the customers requests? Heading back to the counter we told the manager this time that the pizza was incorrect and missing the ham we had asked for. This time the manager grunts at us as if it was our fault they didn't put it on the pizza and tells us \"We'll It's gonna be weird cause we're just gonna put the ham on top of it\". Weird or not if we asked for it on our pizza & even triple checked to see if it was on our pizza that means we want it. In the end I would definitely not choose to come here ever again based on their customer service and lack of respect for the customers.",

I settled on their amber ale and a calzone. Both solid! The calzone was huge and more than enough for two meals. I went with the Sinatra and chose basil, sausage and tomatoes. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. It's a nice little spot.",

They delivered to our hotel (which is always great when I'm traveling without a car) and,  most importantly, their pizza may be the best I've had since moving from the east coast.   Slices were generous, the sauce was flavorful and just the right amount of cheese. And the crust was perfect- foldable and so good we even ate the \"bones\"  Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for True N.Y. style pizza.",

The staff was very attentive, they made sure we had our order and offered us to sit wherever while we waited. Since we ordered a lot they brought out our food in bags and gave us a few pepper packets and made sure the order was right. My sister started to get kidney stone pain and one of the waitresses gave her water with lemon to help. Very friendly, nice place.

I was assured that it had already left the building and was on its way. At 12:30 I called and was told the same thing \"Oh yes, she just left. It should be there any minute.\" 12:50 and my pizza finally arrived. The woman who brought it had a piece of paper with my name on it and nothing else. She was on the phone, on hold, to find out if I had paid by card or if it was cash. I informed her that I ordered the pizza over two hours ago online and paid by card. She ignored me and we stood there for 5 minutes before she would hand over my small, now cold pizza. I signed the blank piece of paper. Now with 10 min left in my lunch break, I opened the box to find a cold and soggy pizza. The crust was wet with, I don't know what and the bottom was almost completely soggy.  This is probably the worst experience I have had. One thing after another, not to mention the website crashed on me three times when I ordered, should've know it would be a problem. Needless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends.",

We went here for dinner while we doing Hell City at the Biltmore.  Figured it was cheaper than spending $200 on dinner there.    My girlfriend and I ordered a couple slices of pizza.  My only problem with the pizza was that it seemed the crust wasn't as good as it usually was.  I wondered if they changed it or it wasn't cooked all the way.  Usually when I eat their pizza I will destroy their crust at the end..  I ate it, but it wasn't the same.  They are also a Pepsi vendor, so that's a plus for me.    NYPD is still my favorite pizza place, but this past visit wasn't the best for me.",

I haven't been here (or it may have been the other location back then) in years since I was a kid, but had a craving for really good pizza and from what I remember, this place has great pizza. So I came with three of my cousins. We knew it was Saturday night and would probably be busy, but we went anyway. It was pretty busy so we were seated by the door which I didn't even care about since the place smelled so good. I was looking forward to getting some broccoli pizza (which very few places have) and I'm sure that would have been great... if we ever got any service.  This was really upsetting. It was pretty busy that night so we waited 10 minutes without drink orders without complaining... and then 15 minutes.. about 20 minutes into our sit-in, I notice that there were people cleaning the empty table next to ours and waiters standing around. Now that I think about it, maybe they didn't even notice that we needed service. But nonetheless, no one came and even asked if we wanted water. Eventually, we just left and had to get food somewhere else.   Really disappointing.",

We ordered the cheese bread and that was pretty good. Next up was the white pizza. Very good. I was surprised! The crust was very good, crisp yet soft and it actually had some taste to it.

We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..  As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.  We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.  What a joke...  **EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something",

That's what I realized when I went to grab a quick lunch to go from NYPD Pizza today. How have I never reviewed them? Because they've been a staple for several years, isn't that more reason to give them a great review? (I promise I'm going to start going through my memory bank and start writing more of these types of reviews)  So like I said, went to NYPD for a quick bite today. Ordered a small chicken ceasar salad to go. The cashier was a younger guy and really friendly. I thought there was a deal for checking in on FourSquare, but the manager that was standing nearby said it was only for dine-in with a group of 3 or more. He gave the discount to me anyways (shhh!). Extra points in my book. Salad came out quickly...drove back to work...and enjoyed a fresh and delicious lunch! The end. =)  (Oh and their garlic knots are ridiculous too)",

Today after an hour and a half went by I called to check on order.  \"It was next out for delivery.\"  The girl didn't seem to happy I was checking up on it.  It took  2 hrs this time.

We got some sodas and ordered our food but to our disappointment multiple people came in, ordered after waiting to be seated and got their food before us. I guess if you seat yourself and put your own order in they no longer consider you a good customer or something because it sure felt like no body cared about our experience. Only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress.  Bad experience service wise but its what we have grown accustomed to at this location. Take my advice and just order delivery.",

The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and I do not have one bad thing to say about this place's service or their regular pies. With that said.....  When I moved from Michigan it was hard for me to find good pizza down here. Papa John's is terrible, Little Cesar's is also terrible - THEN I FOUND NYPD!  I've only tried their regular pizzas and, this past weekend, tried their Sicilian pizza (which is essentially deep dish). BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY! ALSO BEWARE: the Sicilian is mostly dough, which soaks up all of the sauce and depending on what kind of toppings you have, ends up being very watery because of veggies. I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!  Otherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing! Totally worth $20 per pie. My favorite is between Da Works and Big Kahuna - they know how to do a Hawaiian pizza.   I recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!",

I will say that NYPD comes pretty dang close. Even some of my friends from the east coast can attest that it is \"pretty close to NY pie\". I am partial to eating pizza like a fat kid so when I get a slice of sicilian in front of me you would think that the zombie apocalypse was right around the corner.  The prices are fair for what you get and I highly recommend eating carbs with your carbs and order yourself the cheese covered garlic knots. If anything, you will be vampire proof for at least 24 hours. Some locations have a great Happy Hour and an acceptable set up for alcohol. Go, eat, love, regret and do it all over again.

Get some appetizers if you can't wait that long. Salad is a good choice. I personally don't want the cheesy, doughy apps because, well, the pizza is cheesy and doughy.

They have pizza by the slice, which I like, and you can get all kinds of toppings on your pizza for cheap -ish. I had a slice with garlic, basil, meatball, tomato, goat cheese, and something else I can't think of right this second....it was pretty delicious. The BF and I shared some spinach artichoke dip as well, which is always delicious and terrible for you. The service is somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it is fast and friendly and sometimes it is slow for no apparent reason. The last time I went it was the latter. Despite this, I would go back because the pizza is tasty and cheap.",

Well NYPD did not dissappoint me.  One bite and I was hooked.  I no longer have to wander from pizza joint to pizza joint looking for the taste I have so long craved.   Now if I could just find a pizza like the Vinnie Pie I used to buy at Vinnies on Ardmore Blvd back in Pittsburgh. Well I guess you can't have it all though so I will just stick with what I have found at NYPD.",

He Small is an 8 slice 14\" equivalent to most mediums elsewhere.    In short- our long time top dog \"Papa Gino's\" from Boston.. just got officially knocked off.   So go here if it's the last meal you have on earth.  Order it on death row.  Do favors for it.  Anything!  And...  Don't mess around. Do the cheese pizza STRAIGHT UP.   You won't be let down.   I varied mine only by adding asiago cheese to the already perfect blend they use.    Nice tip to appreciate the ingredients and their recipe: ask for a warm cup of the piZza sauce (not marinara) so u can dip that perfectly flavored textured and thickened crust and taste the sauce in its pure state.    Or better yet.. A side or five of the garlicky ranch dressing.    Brilliant.  P.s.  The two gentlemen that sat down behind us were legit old school Italian guys ON CAMELBACK! Speaking Italian throughout dinner.   Not a bad endorsement right there!",

    "text": "I raved about this place to my family and decided to bring them here when I was in Phoenix yesterday about 1pm.  I had been here about a month ago and thought the pizza was very good, and the slices were generous.   I ordered three slices of pizza and had them cut one in half to share with my mom, since I remember the slices were large.  I was surprised when I received my order that the slices were about two-thirds smaller.  We all laughed at how small they were and wondered how I could justify the $17 I had just spent.  I wondered if the slices were smaller on the weekends, and asked a waitress that looked very busy with only one table to attend to.  She quickly replied \"No\" to my question and as I continued to tell her why I was wondering, I realized that she was long gone, leaving me talking to myself.  Which again, gave me and my family another good laugh.  Over all the customers service was poor.  The cashier was rushed and appeared bothered by our ordering and asking questions.  My friends ordered salads that only had lettuce and dressing.  No additional veggies or croutons.  It took three requests for 3 cups to get water before we got them, and then we only got one cup.  I was frankly embarrassed that I had brought them there but luckily it will be my last time.  The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the pizza was good.  I don't just want to complain, I would also like to offer some suggestions. 1. Smile and greet the customers  2. Get items requested promptly  3. When a customer asks a question, acknowledge them, try to find and answer 4. Keep the food portions consistent",

Now we knew the food would be great but what really set this location over the top for us was our waitress, Jayme. She was seriously one of the best waitresses we have encountered and we dine out quite frequently. Not only was she attentive but she was very helpful and super friendly. She was just one of those people that you can tell enjoys her job and that was great to have on Saturday Date Night. For dinner we split an order of wings, half buffalo and half barbecue for my husband since he is allergic to Buffalo  (aka he can't handle the heat). The wings for me were the star of the show. They are perfectly sauced and perfectly cooked and every bite made my mouth water. We also shared a personal size Brooklyn Pizza and Garlic Cheesy Knots that were both bursting with flavor. Overall it was the perfect spot for a casual date night, great food, even better service and a good price. If we are ever in the area again we will visit this location again for sure!",

I'd always thought NYPD made good pizza at a pretty good price, but I've been questioning that position lately and my most recent experience was, I think, the final nail in the coffin.  First of all their prices have increased dramatically, presumably because of Arizona's minimum wage law changes.  I could live with that if the product warranted it but my last takeout order was like eating cardboard with a few ingredients, not much better than Dominoes. I think the problem's simple; there are just too many great (BETTER) pizza joints in the Phoenix metro and NYPD isn't in that class.",

I came here for lunch with a co-worker, and we both had a really good time.  They have a nice menu selection, and the staff here was pretty darn cool.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess, who asked us if we wanted to sit down and have a waitress, or go with the Express Lunch.  She explained the express lunch to us, and we went for it!  We didn't want to waste any time digging into our food, and I'm glad the hostess told us about it right away.  The food here was pretty good, and along with plenty of seating, a bar area, and a nice big menu, I can see myself coming back here as a customer.  Keep up the good work NYPD!",

So, we plan ahead. This time, we were told an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. When we had nada at an hour and twenty minutes, I called and was informed that the delivery times had changed to 75 to 90 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager, and was on hold until I hung up 4 minutes later. Not great customer service, especially with so many good competitors (Bianco's, Parlor) so close. Not delivery, but not an hour and a half with some BS thrown in, either.",

Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!",

It was only 3 ppl at the bar drinking and only 4 of us eating maybe next time the kitchen staff needs to be a lil bit faster and keep your comments to your self. Food was really GOOD!!

We arrived at NYPD Pizza around 7:30 and were promptly seated.  The place was about half full.  Natalie greeted us and provided excellent service throughout the night.   My wife ordered a glass of wine and had a beer. We ordered a small Harvest salad to share--we received the large--and three of us ended up sharing.  It was awesome!   My daughter ordered the spaghetti with garlic knots.  She loved it, and the portion size was generous.  My son had the traditional wings, and they were good too!   My wife and I shared the 14\" Wall Street and it was delicious.  We ate all but one piece.    If you are looking for a reasonably priced pizza joint with a large variety and good service, NYPD pizza should fit the bill.  And again, Natalie was AWESOME!",

The people were wonderful too - the Groupon stated \"eat-in\" only, but I was by myself and really just wanted a pizza for take-out.  They accommodated me without question and even gave me a free soda while I waited.  I will definitely be back here for the pizza again and to try other things on the menu",
