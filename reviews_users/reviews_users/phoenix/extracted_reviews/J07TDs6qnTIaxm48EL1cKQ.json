On our last visit there, Soupy was EXTREMELY nice and made up for the terrible birthday experience I had at their Scottsdale location. Get the blood orange martini on the rocks and the spicy thai chicken bowl, you won't be disappointed. `",

We ended up going on a Sunday night (which the server said is the slowest night) and it was dead. We got seated and although the we were a tad over dressed loved the place! We got the scorpion bowl which was only $15 and we got a good buzz  he ordered jerked pork which was amaze. It came with a side of plantains and corn bread which was a nice filler. I got the blackened wasabi ahi which was also amazing. I've been searching for some decent fish here and I finally found it!! Service was great and we got our meals very fast. Hula's for the win and we will definitely be back",

We were very pleased and excited that we had found this gem! The next day while looking through Phoenix Health inspections, we were mortified to see Hulas for uncleanliness. The inspection was specific that multiple roaches were found in the bar area and unsafe food temps. I get very picky when it comes to raw foods and uncleanliness. From what I observed, everything looked AMAZING however I can't help but think about their health code violations. Maybe next time I go, I should ask for their restaurant grade! If you don't believe me here is their health/inspection report! They were graded with a D  UPDATE: I received a response from the owner and was informed that since the previous inspection, new rules/regulations and positions have taken place to make sure their restaurant rules are up to par. Maybe I might make my way over sometime this week and try the poki! :)",

The decor, food, atmosphere, drinks, and service are all great. I'm a particular fan of the black bean burger; it's not like many of the veggie-based burgers. This is thick, hearty, flavorful, and not heavy. I don't know if your tastebuds would, but mine boogie with glee. I also like the shrimp tacos with their version of slaw. Again, not heavy and just the right blend of acid and sweet.   Their happy hours are such great deals, and happy hour on the weekends is practically the entire day! Anybody up for some Tiki Time?   The patio is fantastic for sitting and sunning along the light rail path. You can glimpse the dome of St Francis Xavier or look across toward the interior of the restaurant. Either way, you feel like you are in a happy Phoenix place.   The best part? A pup friendly patio, and that's always platinum to me! Not only to they allow dogs, they'll bring out a bowl of water and include a cookie or two, too! Two paws up!",

I waited around for a few minutes then had a seat at the bar. The service was friendly but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

THE DECOR -- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls. -- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.  THE REST -- starting to develop a pet peeve for \"sauces\" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish. IT GOES UNDERNEATH THE ITEM OR NEXT TO IT! OR IMAGINE.... IN IT. -- no reservation taken unless you've got six in your party. BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside.",

We had a party of 9 and more than a few items on the appetizer menu ran out. I ordered a Hawaiian white fish Ceviche. It was so soar I couldn't finish the whole fish. My friend ordered a mahi mahi. The fish tastes very well but he didn't like the sauce that goes with it. With that said, the server brought out another one with no sauce in it.  I asked around all of my foodie friends. No one seems to complain about the food but didn't exactly like it either. I still want to give it 3 stars due to great customer service. Other than that I probably will not come back here again.",

All wonderful, no complaints.  The only negative is the pot stickers only come fried.  You cannot get them pan fried or steamed.  (At least that is what we were told by our food server).  Drinks:  Zombie, Mai Tai, Painkiller, Hula's Hurricane,  Dr. Funk, Hawaii 5-0.  Favorites  are the Painkiller and Mai Tai.   The Mai Tai's are a little more tangy than the traditional.

The Pink Bikini is good, and if you want more bang for your buck order the Zombie. Tiki drinks run about $7 or $5 during happy hour. Really great place to relax, but if you are on a budget this place can be a bank buster. The appetizers all look amazing, and I've order fish bites, thai fish cakes, and sweet potato fries. Mmm...the fish is so fresh and the dipping sauces have me swooned just as much as the BO martini. I'll frequent this place more often, but know that 3 drinks or 2 and an appetizer is gonna run me around $25...eek.",

Our boy was well behaved, only a little loud happy talking here and there.  He coiored with crayons and paper that we brought.  Stayed at the table with us.    We were not told someone will be with you in a moment by other server who tended to others for about 5 minutes.  When our server came, we ordered tea, water, a fancy juice for our boy and shrimp rolls.    Shrimp rolls came before drinks.  They were crispy on outside but filled with imitation crab and only a few bits of shrimp.  Good sauce.  Tea and water came and then then a few minutes later the juice.  The boy enjoyed a big juice with cerrries, oranges, and an umbrella.  Husb. ordered a fish dinner with sweet potato fries, ceasar salad and mac n' cheese for our boy.  Would share.  It was a LONG time before main food finally came.  I asked about it as we all were getting antsy.  Server told us that it would be less than 5 minutes as they were waiting on the mac n' cheese.  She said sandwich (we didn't order a sandwich but we took it anyway) was ready and did we want it now, before the mac n' cheese.  Yes!  Sandwich and fries came out COLD and the salad came out warm.  All three tasty though.  Mac n' cheese came too and it was NOT hot.  All in all, maybe they didn't like that we had a 3 year old with us.  There was a group of young twentish girls giving us the eye.  Don't worry, we'll never take him there again.  Not sure if I'll even go with girlfriends for happy hour.",

I went on a Wednesday night, they had late happy hour which was great. Got a Pink Bikini Martini which was good, Hawaiian Ceviche which was awesome, nice chucks of fish yummy!!!, Also I got the sweet potato fries...loved them. These were just the appetizers which were like $3-$5 during the happy hour time. Since they were so cheap I kinda stocked up on the appetizers. For the main course I have the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl, OMG..it was so good.  The wait staff was quick and attentive and it was a little busy.   I would mos def go back to this place, good food, good ambience, great place to go just chill out.",

Obviously it's a tiki and Hawaiian theme so I was hoping they would have one of my Hawaiian barbecue favorites. I settled on the fish sandwich, which was very tasty. Perfect seasoning and the fish is not a deep fried patty like most it was lump fish meat (can't remember which fish variety). It was really tasty. They have tiki mugs for signature drinks and 4 taps that serve only Kona beer varieties. Overall, I liked the concept and would probably come back with friends.",

I thought it was all right, but they sure doused it in 12 gallons of soy sauce and sort of over did it with the sweet pineapples. After being forced to eat white rice every night for the past 19 years due to a very persuasive/aggressive Asian mother, I vowed to stop eating it when I got out of the house but because it was so overly sweet and salty, I had to ask for more of the rice that came with it just to mellow my mouth out.   While I should give it 3 stars, I can honestly say that you cannot beat their happy hour prices. Thanks to this place, my boyfriend and my wallet are both happy and he's able to drop his 'macho' guard, He now happily drinks Orange Martinis and Mai Tai's, but at Hula's. Anywhere else and it's back to his manly Samuel Adams and Four Peaks. Le sigh.",

What can I say, it's a bang for your buck with tons of rum and brandy and even fire in the middle of their signature green bowls and neon long straws that I absolutely adore! I came here to celebrate finishing my MBA. I came here when I had a rough day. I came here when I landed in Phoenix after a long vacation and needed a welcome home drink. Hula's is the best place to drink festively and so be it, it is my go to celebration spot and should be everyone else's, too!  Also, tip: during Happy Hour come ready to spend some Lincolns because you can get a ton of apps and cocktails at $5 a piece. On Wednesdays the HH extends for drinks for all night! Cheers all!",

Upon arriving was a 20 minute wait, which is fine. They had a speak easy that we had cocktails in while waiting for our table. The speak easy had a bar and the bartender made delicious drinks, however was not very friendly. Our phone notified us that our table was ready so we closed out our tab and went to the hostess stand. Once we got to the hostess stand the girls told us that our table was no longer available because a man had his walker blocking his way to our table. I respect the elderly and understand that their walkers/wheelchairs may take up excess room. So they put us back on a wait.   They text us a second time, and as we waited for the two hostess to finish their conversation; they looked annoyed as we waited and than asked 'did we text you?'  Than my boyfriend was about to lose his mind and we left. This is primarily a personnel review.  We know from the past the food and drinks to be great, as well as the staff, but tonight we walked out before we even had a chance to eat.  Boyfriend...pissed",

I was pleased to receive a call on Sunday morning confirming my reservation. We really appreciate being able to get a reservation when we have a group. It was very hot on the patio.  I did not even give it a thought when I made the reservation that it would be uncomfortable for us. Our waitress, ( I wish I would have taken note of her name) was wonderful.  She managed to move us inside.  Thus saving our brunch. She did a GREAT job with us!!  We tipped her well, as we appreciated her so much.  She got our orders correct and our checks too. This was difficult with us moving.  Thank you so much for making Hula's a place that is a must when we have guests.  Everyone had a great time and the Illinois friends enjoyed the spam. We loved Ticoz's and are happy we now have a great new place to gather with our guests and our Arizona friends. Dana, you have come a long way with the new Hula's. You got off to a rough start, but have made it our favorite place!!  Thank you so much!!!",

    "text": "Hula's did not disappoint me on my most recent visit.  Oh - and being they were open later than almost everything in Phoenix on January 2 - they were a life saver.   I ordered a Hula burger with sweet potato fries (natch). It was perfectly cooked to temp.   Yes, I had one Dr. Funk for old times' sake. I rarely drink these days (a few times over the last couple years), but I could not resist. It was just as delicious as I remembered.   The waitress sat my friend and I in a corner of the restaurant, which was fine for conversation.  She was friendly and available without being bothersome.   My friend had the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them.   Overall, I had a great meal.    I think I will visit again with my fiance when he is in town!",

We've decided to not eat in here anymore because flies are landing on customers food, the opened drink garnish container, pretty gross thought on what we're getting for food and how many flies are in the kitchen. My last black bean burger I started to wonder how many beans compared to flies is in my burger. I've noticed a customer mention this to the manager on a few occasions when I was there, all he does is shrug his shoulders in confusion and ignores the request.",

We visited around 3pm on a Tuesday (lunch) so it wasn't very busy. Our server brought out a water dish right away (so hospitable) & he was very attentive to our needs (aka drink refills cuz it was hot af out.) The decor is top notch, even the bathrooms. I wish there were a location in Columbus as the food is a refreshing change & their happy hour looks great! Next time I'm in PHX i will be sure to stop back!",

    "text": "I had Hula's on my \"to do\" list for waaaaay too long! We went for a proper birthday celebration and had a wonderful time. Everything about this place was just about perfect. From the time I made the reservation, to the super cool atmosphere, to the mod tiki decor and music choices, to being greeted and seated by the adorable hostess, to the service at the table, to the clean restrooms, and of course, to the delicious and innovative food and drinks. ALL ON POINT. We started with the coconut shrimp rolls, spicy edamame, and calamari. The pineapple horseradish sauce with the coconut shrimp was lovely and sweet/spicy. The edamame was the best I've had in a long time. It was very well seasoned and spicy with lots of yummy flavor crumbs we enjoyed as much as the edamame itself. Our least favorite was the calamari, which was very thick cut...like calamari steak fries. The sauce was like an aioli. Many would love it this way and we ate it and enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't pick it again. Our entrees were all excellent. I highly recommend the Jaeaiian Jerk pork. It is super tender and very flavorful with just the right combo of flavor and mild heat with proper jerk spice. The Duke's pork is very sweet with a soy pineapple flavor base. Also, if you are hungry...order one of their bowls. The Thai Chicken bowl was so delicious, with a lovely peanut sauce and addition of avocado for that extra creamy richness. The combo base of black beans, cabbage and rice is so much better than plain rice. We also had snapper. The plantains, johnny cake and mango salsa are all excellent as well. Now, the drinks...oh boy! The Tiki Bastard (ginger beer bourbon rum), Lilikoi margarita (passion fruit), and Painkiller (rum juices) were all amazing. But, the Blood Orange Martini was the star of our table. All of these drinks were so well balanced and not sicky sweet. Excellent fresh ingredients. We loved our experience and will definitely be returning for lunches, dinners, and the incredibly reasonable and fun Happy Hour.",

I would probably skip the Mac nut crusted tofu. The tofu was more soft than I was picturing and I just wasn't into it. It also came with rice and some cole slaw.",

If it's cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio - I highly recommend it. Inside can be a bit crowded and noisy like a cafeteria..  Moving onward - during happy hour, most tiki drinks are only $5! And they have some yummy food on special too! (The spicy edamame was delicious.)  While we were there, we got the Dr. Funk, Painkiller, Zombie and the One-Eyed Pyrat. They were all great but the Dr. Funk and the Zombie were definitely my fave! The presentation of the drinks is awesome too. Each drink comes in a tiki mug to match the theme of your drink; so fun! Now I know why so many people are into tiki cocktails! I think I may be a new fan!  From what I hear and have seen, they have a pretty good dessert menu! I definitely gotta try a piece of their Coconut Cream Pie next time! ;)",

This place has a great vibe and I have no doubt that it would be an ideal happy hour spot.  However, I am rating it a 3-star for a two reasons:    1) The food.  Let's face it, that is the end all be all right?  If the food is average, then I have to give it an average score (not bad... just not great either).  I had the recommended Mahi with Blackend spice and wasabi potatoes.  If you like overwhelming spice, this is your dish!  I felt the blackend spice was sufficient and I told the hostess that point.  It overwhelmed any taste of the fish itself.  2) While I thought our hostess was really nice, she needed support on a Monday night.  Drinks were slow in coming.    So it was fun to stop by, but not sure it was worth a special trip.  Cheers.",

My favorite app was the ceviche. It was really good! Fresh, bold flavors, and plentiful. I also had he shrimp rolls and they were good. Tried one of someone elses pot stickers and some edamame. The splicy edamame was really good and unique. The pink bikini martini was my favorite drink. The watermellon flavor is subtle but refreshing.   They had old Elvis movies playing on the wall the evening I went which was a fun touch. I think the patio will be a great spot this fall.

The food was just okay. The jawaiian jerk chicken plate; favor was okay but the rice was gluey and the johnny cakes where very dry and only one plantain slice?  The loco moco; the burger patty was burnt and tasted like old grill. Once again the rice was gluey and the gravy had a skin on it. About the only decent part was the egg. I have far better at plate lunch joints for half the price. This place says tiki but really doesn't deliver.  The signature cocktails are okay but not True to tiki and the staff seemed oblivious and as if they would rather be somewhere else.",

    "text": "Just because the server will take back a poorly mixed drink or charred beans doesn't make it a good place to eat and drink.  The food at Hula's needs to be good and consistent, not just returnable.  On a Saturday night, four of us hit Hula's at 6pm.  What's so striking when you enter is how open the bar and dining room are to the patio, which needs a few more tables and chairs, I'd say.  Central Phoenix enthusiasts love a good adaptive reuse project, and the one at Hula's, especially because of the preservation of the impressive and large hexagonal window, puts it in the same category as Postino Central and St. Francis as far as an amateur's view of architectural renovations.  We started by sharing the sweet potato fries, which are on-par with Maizie's and even those at Delux.  They were crisp, evenly cut, and intensely creamy and sweet.  After this, though, it was downhill.  Though my companions enjoyed their drinks, my Zombie, served in a tall opaque glass with a mustachioed character who looked a lot like me, was poorly mixed, lacking lime juice, and faintly soap-tasting.  The server gave me a couple minutes to weigh the drink's future, and after agreeing to suffer through it, I changed my mind and sent it back.  (The Zombie would later still appear on the bill.)  The Dark & Stormy I ordered in its place, with dark rum and ginger beer, was drinkable, but inferior to the drink of the same name at St. Francis, which, for $2 more, tastes $4 better.  I think it's in the quality of the ginger beer.  My friend's fishcakes were mostly overcooked and had to be cut with a knife, like chicken.  The ceviche, though palatable, my other friend said, appeared dry and haphazardly plated with some giant tortilla chips.  As the lone veggie in the bunch, I ordered the Spicy Tofu Tacos, which come with a spicy chili sauce and a side of rice and black beans.  Though the food came out of the kitchen quickly -- 12 minutes or so -- I wish it hadn't.  The tofu, a recently unpackaged watery brick no doubt, was merely sliced, warmed (not grilled or fried or marinated over night), and dusted with chili powder; therefore, the tofu was tasteless.  The tacos were double-wrapped in flour tortillas, which created a thick, awkward mouthfeel, so I just used one of the tortillas on each of my two tacos.  But the most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans, which are hard to screw up.  The black beans were so badly burned in the pot that even their juices saturated the scoop of rice with their charred, charcoal (bad) smoke flavor.  I mentioned this to the server, and she later would deduct half of the plate's $11 price (though the extra Zombie remained on the ticket).  We passed on dessert and went to St. Francis and later Fez for drinks.  Hula's would be a great happy hour spot on the patio if it offers consistent drinks and some happy hour food specials.  Two stars for potential, and I will try once more.  As it stands now, though, an accommodating server cannot compensate for an inconsistent bartender, burned beans, and uninventive vegetarian options.  note: I am totally aware that restaurants don't have to cater to my or other people's various dietary preferences (i.e., vegetarians and vegans), and that I choose to go to these restaurants.  I just want some rice and beans to rely on.",

    "text": "After a long day and a longer week, I agreed to fetch the BFF from the airport in exchange for dinner.  We initially decided on Maizie's, but when the entire lot at the Landmark was full, we circled around to the adjacent complex and decided to try Hula's instead.  The patio was full, but we were immediately seated inside.  Our waitress Victoria was quite charming and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu while we chatted.  After a few minutes, he decided on a beer and I asked for a passion fruit iced tea and the Zombie - a delightful combination of rum and fruit juices.  After we ordered, we sat back and enjoyed the ambiance.  The indoor seating area was empty, but a group of four was seated beside us.  I wasn't sure about the close seating with connected tabletops, but it really wasn't so bad, even when a group of four was seated right beside us.  I excused myself to use the restroom and was happy to see it was clean and non-smelly.  A short while later, our meals arrived.  We both ordered burgers - his was beef and had mushrooms and mine was Ahi, and of course, we both ordered the sweet potato fries.  Unfortunately, they were undercooked!  We let our waitress know, and she took our plated after apologizing.  She returned minutes later with our burgers and a promise of a fresh basket of fries for us to share.  The fresh batch of fries was much better - hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I think Mazie's are better, but these were definitely good.  Our burgers were each served on really nice, thick buns with sesame seeds.  I can't speak for my friend's meal, but my burger was wonderful!  I asked for no slaw and the sun-dried tomato pesto aioli on the side.  The aioli had a really nice flavor and tasted great on the burger.  The ground tuna seemed to have been combined with diced serranos which gave it a really, really nice flavor and a bit of heat.  Despite being stuffed, we each finished our meals and sat talking for a long while after.  Our waitress was super-attentive and kept the iced tea and water refills coming steadily.  Nice surprise: after the bill was paid, she brought us an order of shrimp rolls.  She said it was an incorrect order but wanted us to have them since we were so great.  I'm not a fan of shrimp, but the rolls looked and smelled delicious.  I tried some (sans shrimp) and loved the flavor of the toasted coconut flakes and the really great pineapple dipping sauce.  I am very much looking forward to returning to Hula's again and again.  Lunch service will begin on November 1, which seems too far away.  Great service, great food, great ambiance - love it!",

I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Rolls & salad off their lunch menu. They were delicious, but I wish they were a little heavier on the coconut.

    "text": "My sister and I were actually planning on trying out St. Francis down the street, but upon driving up, discovered it is closed on Mondays! So, we headed down the street to Hula's to check out their soft opening.  I had walked over there earlier to check it out and grab a menu and everyone was so friendly, so I suggested to my sister we eat there.    They were only offering a limited menu for their soft opening, but this menu along with the regular menu which offers about three times as many delicious menu options were both fabulous!   We decided to sit on their patio, which despite the large fire pit in the middle was remarkably cool for a summer night! The atmosphere was great - nice and quiet yet you still feel like you're somewhere happening and trendy.  It actually kind of felt like we were eating in a trendy part of LA.  The staff was all very friendly, and our service was prompt and pretty efficient.  They goofed with the food they brought to our table twice, but it did not affect our dining experience at all, as the food was still brought out within 15 minutes or so.  This was pretty impressive for their first night.    Now on to the food ....  soooo good! We started with the seared ahi wontons, which were pieces of fresh ahi tuna atop a crisp wonton and served with a wasabi sour cream/green onion garnish - perfect combination of flavors.  Both my sister and I said we would order this again as a meal.  We shared a lemongrass encrusted ono, which came with rice and a cabbage slaw.  This was also a perfect combination of flavors.  The portion was fairly large, too, so it was a great dish to share - we even were able to take home some leftovers.  The one comment my sister had was that she would order the sauce on the side next time because it was kind of rich, but I was pretty happy with it.  We did not order any alcoholic beverages, so I cannot comment on those, but from the looks of the drink menu and all of the people around us ordering drinks, they seem to be pretty good! I had their passion fruit iced tea, and it was so good I asked for some to go.    I give this place four stars not five because of a small snafu ... I brought the leftovers (which the server packaged for us in a container she labeled with the contents and the date), and while my boyfriend was eating them just minutes later, he found a short black hair in the dish .... Kinda gross but hoping it was just an off moment for them because I still cannot wait to go back and try some other menu items like the Thai Chicken bowl and the shrimp tacos!",

The only reason Hulas doesnt get 5 stars from me is the food, its been hit and miss for me.  Not bad but not AMAZING, and when you build a place like this with such fantastic drinks and an excellent ambiance you would only expect the food to follow suit.  That being said I will go again and try something new again and hopefully I'll find that dish that blows me away but for the mean time I'll enjoy drinking like I'm on a tropical island in the middle of the desert.",

The bar staff was very friendly and engaging and gave me advice on the best bar to watch a football game . The decor speaks Hawaiian complemented by text mex flavours on the menu. The outdoor dining area is large and open to the bar. I liked it and would definitely go back.",

Never have had anything but great service here, the food has always been consistently amazing and they make some awesome house cocktails. I've come for happy hour quite a few times, and we even came here on NYE for their live music and all-night happy hour - what a fun crowd and a great time. Brunch on the weekends has always treated me great as well, I love their spin on a benedict. All in all, a solid go-to spot with a fun theme in downtown phoenix.",

I have had nothing but great experiences every time I have been here and even told myself after my second to last visit that I would leave a positive review, but after tonight's service I made it a priority to leave my input. The service is always very attentive and kind, and the food and drinks selection is to die for. Me and my boyfriend swear by the cajun burger and mac and cheese both, paired with sweet potato fries and regular fries (they'll allow you to split both)--it's the stuff dreams are made of. The cocktails are fantastic in that they have a myriad of fun and exotic options for a reasonable price, yet they make sure not to skimp on the potency; notable selections would the blood orange martini (on the rocks) for a sweet and tart option, or a Scorpion Bowl (large tropical cocktail served in a bowl suitable for 2-4 people with a flaming shot of 151 in the middle) if you're sharing a good time with some friends. Our servers there have always been great, but a special thanks to both Kate and Kyle for consistently exceptional service. Both have truly gone above and beyond to accommodate our needs without batting an eyelash.   I work in reputation management so I understand the importance of great establishments getting the public praise they deserve. Every restaurant should strive to be like this one--Hula's employees and management, keep doing what you're doing, don't change a thing.",

The food was also very good, I got the chicken skewers and the pulled pork, and both very well cooked and flavorful.  I would have liked more chicken, or some veggies, for the price.

No need to head to Springfield for a Flaming Moe, you can order a cocktail here that literally comes in a flaming bowl.    The atmosphere is fun and the place is bright and cheerful in the day and dim and cozy at night.  The service is always excellent.

They're keeping 'ex lax fish' on the menu though.  I just hope they advise the possible side effects.  We had an early supper here, no drinks.  Had borh the blackened and pan seared  Butterfish, very good.  I'd never heard of butterfish before but took the plunge.  What happened when we got home caused me to look it up: learned it has good texture and flavor - both check.  So why the 1 star?  Seems that butterfish is another name for a fish called escolar, which has vast quantities of wax ester in it.  Another name for excolar is \"the ex lax of fish\".  Right on.  For both of us,  We got lucky apparently, it is often worse and lasts for days.  Why have it on a menu when it can have these kinds of side effects?",

The reason for the 3 stars is because Of NOT having a changing table in their bathrooms old and new locations.  There are two stalls in the women's bathroom and one big one for disabled and one small one. I had to get creative and I took their bamboo end table into the big stall and used it as a changing table lol. I am not putting my adorable baby boy in a bathroom floor. That stall is big enough to install one on the wall. Of course I put the end table back. We went during the late afternoon. The food is delicious (unfortunately I can't have a lot of their food since I'm allergic to coconut...boo). The food is pricey. Service is great. I'll change my rating when they install a changing table in the big stall.",

Delicious fish, great texture in what seemed like a panko/cornmeal coating. Oh man. So good. The folks at the table next to me were locals, ordered them as well, and totally agreed. Also, this is the first place EVER, that I have tasted a crunchy sweet potato fry. Ordered the POKE bowl and it was delicious. Tuna was spot on. Service was good. Ate outside. Need the t-shirt.",

The decor is a little more modern but not to over the top as to not lose their identity. Tiki bars may not be making a comeback but this place is doing a great job with keeping the spirit alive. The happy hour is great the drinks can be a little sweet but that's how you get caught off guard after a couple. Plenty of space since they opened up the old Ticos building. Once it cools down the outdoor patio will be the spot! Try the coconut shrimp rolls and have a dark/stormy cocktail and chill.",

It would either be coming with a group of friends or coming late at night to have a drink after work or coming here on dates.  What matter which time or who I was with the service is always great.    One Wednesday's they have happy hour all night.  The menu is a decent size for being a happy hour menu. I normally get the pork tacos and a couple of Mai Tai's and I'm all set for the evening.    On the patio they have a big fire pit that they turn during the winter months. So that you can stay warm while you are drinking and eating. I enjoy sitting by the fire pit on night to keep me warm, since I'm cold all the time.   Last thing, if you feel like trying something different you should come to Hula's for there brunch and try the Spam Benedict.  It is amazing, I enjoy having it once in a while.",

Now lets be fair, im not fond of the cuisine so I will say they have some vegetarian options, and they are good, again nothing great, but then thats not their main business. I would think its sea food and from my friends who have had food here it is pretty good.   Service - what service ? It can range form OK to abysmal depending on the mood of the person and that is reason enough to not bother.   Drinks - Absolute waste.

I love downtown Phoenix and have enjoyed watching it evolve and change demographics over the past three decades. This experience was horrible. I had to constantly get up and ask for service. When the drink I ordered was ready and sitting in front of the bar tender on the bar I was tired of it sitting there and asked the bar tender if I could grab my own drink. The guy shrugged and pretended to have no clue where the drink belonged and therefore was unable to help me. It was absurd. Service isn't always this bad but on this particular day ALL service was horrible enough to end my choosing Hula's.",

Wife had Baja fish tacos, which she enjoyed. I had the 1/2 slab of BBQ ribs, and they were excellent! Came with perfect sweet potato fries and some forgettable cole slaw.

We both like trout/grouper so this fish was right in line with the taste.  I'd give the fish 4.5 stars for Arizona.  The red beans and rice were a nice touch.

Food was good but nothing to come back for... and the service... wow the service was terrible.  We got seated fine. But after that it was bad. We didn't get any attention for a long time finally after the people behind us had water I went up to the hostess stand where a server was and asked for our server.. she asked if I seated ourselves which we didn't (and I thought that was rude to ask... we were seated for about 10 minutes even if we had-again we didnt- someone should have addressed us) and then said she would ask. The same girl then came a few minutes later with water. Then finally our server came and apologized that no one told her we were here.... maybe they don't know their tables before we are seated but she definitely saw us as she had the two tables next to us but never addressed us. Anyway it took awhile to get everything and our appetizer we needed to ask for plates when we were clearly sharing... we had to ask for water to be refilled... we waited a while for our check but then everything sped up. I guess they wanted to get paid....  Anyway overall I debated between 2 and 3 stars but gave 2 because my friends who live down the street said they wouldn't be back... which I feel shows how disappointed we were... I feel like 3 stars means we would be back but we most likely won't.",

The space is a little on the small side, so take that into consideration on Friday or Saturday. We got the last indoor table at 7pm on Tuesday.  The food and drinks are in another world. I had a Zombie which was sweet but not too sweet. The Duke's Pork was marinated and covered in their pineapple sauce.  The hostess was nowhere to be found for about 5 minutes before we were seated, and several groups came in and clogged the entry during that time. Both waiters that served us were excellent, and food came out very quick.",

I ordered the Mai Tai- it was very well made and well priced at 6$ during HH. I also ordered a pork Taco and the house fries off the HH menu. The Taco was great, but fries were soggy. I would definitely recommend coming in during happy hour (all day Wednesday!!) you will not be disappointed.",

Enjoyed some really good happy hour specials. The Mai Tais are different from what you'd regularly get, a little less sweet a little more lime flavor, but a good strong drink and I really enjoyed the flavor. We also tried the chicken sticks, chicken wings, fish bites and french fries (regular and sweet potato). All were excellent. For dinner I had the Ahi Tacos. They put so much Ahi on each one that I could only eat one and took the other home. The flavor was really good, definitely fresh Tuna and I loved the spicy salsa it came with.   Beyond the food, the service was also excellent. We ordered different things over the course of two hours and our waitress did not seem to mind continuing to check on us. She was friendly, attentive and our food came out quick. Overall this place was a win and we will definitely be back.",

Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me.   I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Mary's and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed.   Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!",

The Hangover Hash was disappointing, but my wife's Island Eggs Benedict was terrific, with rich and smoky ham. I eat a lot of ham, and Hula's ham made me take a step back. Maybe the late service should be chalked up to a rush or an anomaly, but our server didn't seem particularly aware of how long it was taking, and also didn't seem interested in checking in on us.  ADDENDUM: Hula's owner reached out to apologize for our lack of service that day, assuring me they were still working out a few logistical issues. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I'm aware how those things often spiral out of control of the staff. I've waited far longer at places, and part of this review stemmed from the fact our 16 month old daughter was with us, tired and cranky.  The truth is, we loved the ambiance and prices. If the food had come quicker, we would've been pleased with the service (we could've had more check-ins, however). I should've emphasized the potential...when the logistics are ironed out, this will be one of the best brunches in Phoenix. As-is, it's really good.

The very notion of postmodern clear-surfaced restraint applied to the inherent and necessary tackiness of a tiki bar. That's what doesn't work.  Tiki bars aren't places you see profiled in Modern Architecture. They are the bottom of the barrel of grandiose American bourgeois self-indulgence. Yeah, and the drinks should be exotic and strong. That goes without saying. But you can have a Zombie or a Dr. Funk of Tahiti in any Hilton. You go to a tiki bar to remind yourself of how tacky previous generations were in their attempts to stretch beyond the blandness of plaid polyester slacks from JC Penney and Oldsmobile 88's without leaving Des Moines.    To appreciate the tiki bar today we must approach with irony. However, Hula represents an irony in itself: A contradiction that is unresolved and leaves one asking \"why?\"",

The restaurant was fairly busy for the small inside table space. Me and the BF got seated right away, and I of course went right for the drink menu, I don't usually like fruity drinks, which seems to be what they specialize in, but I gave the Tiki Bastard a try, the BF had the pain killer. My drink was pretty good, it has an overly string bourbon taste so if thats your thing, you definitely might enjoy. The BF's drink was too pineapple-y for my taste, but he loved it.   We started by sharing the ceviche on fried wontons which was bomb. Very yummy, it didn't stand a chance. Me and the BF got into a debate about the food title worthiness of wontons when i declared wontons were one of my favorite foods. He argued wontons were not a food... I obviously disagreed.   On to the entrees. I had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries... It was good enough, I think the fries would have been much better had they been hotter or fresher... but overall it was a good meal. The BF had the habanero lime chicken tacos which were ahhh-mazing. Very very spice but delicious.   We ordered another round of drinks before we finished. I had the mai tai which was really yummy with a fruity but almost sour taste that I loved. The BF had some other drink whose name i can't remember but it came with a backscratcher and had 151 in it. Too strong of an alcohol taste for me, but he liked it.  Overall, the restaurant was really yummy, we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've had some varied experiences at Hula's so I've never sat down to write a review- I've never had a full meal, and it usually seems to be a place that I hit up on a night where I'm bar crawlin' all over CenPho.  However, there are two specific experiences that made me feel compelled to write a review:  1.  On a Sunday funday when I didn't really need another cocktail, I found myself here.  I asked for a recommendation and was told that the margarita is very popular.  I tried it and was not happy.  Without saying a word, I handed it back to my server.  He smiled at me and took it off the bill.  I'm glad he understood what needed to happen without me having to open my mouth.  2.  Last Friday, I fell down and scraped the hell out of my knees.  Hula's was where I was heading, so despite the gushing blood, I went right ahead with my plans.  Although they didn't have any band-aids (I believe the manager put it on his to-do list), the hostess was SUPER awesome.  She sat me in a high top chair, helped me cover my wounded knees with square napkins and taped them up for me.  So, yeah, in my mind, Hula's is pretty effin' solid.  I've heard they have a ton of veggie options, so I'm hoping to have a sit-down meal soon.",

    "text": "Little know Debbie fact, back when I was about 21 , I had a strong hankering for  the hula . I took  hula classes, twirled  poi pots  about my head and shook my  coconuts believing it would  make me feel tropical and mysterious.  Now, the closest I get to feeling tropical is a night at Hula's. Which is about as much effort as I want to put into it  mysterious anymore.  Hula's Modern Tiki  screams  a fusion of tropical funky with delicious delights . When I walk in the door i am ready to be pulled away from the outside world and imagine myself sitting in a beach town bar.   For me the kitschy , campy Polynesian style makes me me feel giddy.  I love vintage, camp and the Hula's pulls it off. I have  had some amazing good times drinking a silly  drink called Mr. Funk --a combo of coconut rum, banana liqueur and who knows what  served in a tiki glass, sitting with my darling bestie Tom S.  , gossiping , dishing and figuring out the walk of life. We both love  the Poke   , a dish of raw tuna , avocado with a sauce de soy.  The coconut spring roll makes me happy as well. It's light , sweet and stuffed with shrimp and coconut. I can highly recommend  their food.  Think fish , think tropical flair , think delicious.  Just about every time  I am at Hula's I have enjoyed myself and loved my experience. I am sure hanging out with Tom has a lot to do with it but  it helps to go to a fun place too.  i have a personal conviction you can' t drink out of a glass shaped like a tiki god and not have fun.  The staff (except for one  underwhelmed waitress who seemed quite irritated when we asked for drinks at the bar, what was THAT about)  have made me feel welcomed and comfortable. They tend to act like they enjoy what they do and they are hanging out with you too. I look forward to more good times at Hula's Modern Tiki  ....",

    "text": "Now you all know I don't really write Yelp reviews except when I feel like being a complete jackass or showing off my brilliant writing skills, but for once, this is a legit review that I just had to do.  I had been putting off having dinner with a family friend that I haven't seen for nearly a decade for a while, and he finally conned me into it.  Hey, free dinner, I'll take it.    I've been to Hula's a few times, and it's a cool joint with a great patio.  I thought it would be a chill place to go chat and grub on tasty food.  However, it took about 3 seconds for me to realize that my friend was one of \"those\" people.  Ya know, 9000 special requests, never pleased with anything, and constantly changing their mind.  Basically, the dude that everyone just loves to be at a restaurant with.  A server's nightmare.  So as I'm sitting there trying not to smack him, it dawns on me that our waitress, Estelle, is handling this fool with as much grace as I've ever witnessed from a server........She was charming, funny, and when most servers would have tossed a drink in his face or spit on his burger, ok wait........  \"Double baco-cheese, it's for a cop.\" \"What does that mean, you're gonna spit in it now?\" \"Don't spit, in that cop's burger\"  \"I don't want a large Farva, I want a god damn liter of cola!\"  Sorry couldn't resist the Super Troopers reference.  Basically, she was perfect.  When he wanted a bigger lemon wedge for his water, I almost murdered him, and the only thing that stopped me was her wink, smile, and promise to him that he was about to have the best lemon wedge of his life. The food was good, but the experience in general started out daunting and Estelle was a champion.    The next time you're headed to Hula's, I recommend that giant bowl of booze, and I also recommend checking for open tables in Estelle's section.",

    "text": "went on a Thursday evening with the BF and a couple new friends. REALLY like the decor - it's simple and linear and truly avoids the overdone \"kitschy\" thing. I especially love the shelves in the dining room lined with mini tiki heads.  Our server, a blonde gentleman, was attentive and very friendly throughout. Cool guy.  I had two martinis - the blood Orange martinis. they were good, but they had actual chewable chunks of ice floating on top - which is really unusual for a martini. Maybe I was more worried about being caught chewing ice and having someone across the dining room think \"Geez that guy is sexually frustrated\".  We ordered and enjoyed both the tuna poke (nice portion) and i think the fish tartar with these really great crisps that accompanied them.  Din din? I had Tuna steak in lemongrass. Though the taste was good, the temp was so-so. A little on the medium to cold side. Also - for the price you pay, rice and a small lump of coleslaw don't cut it with me. They need to amp up the sides a bit.  WARNING: SUPER PICKY MOMENT! If you're gonna have a carefully thought out restaurant like this with good design and an urban feel, PLEASE make your staff dresscode at least a half notch above \"jeans and a black t-shirt with the restaurant name screenprinted on it\". We can get this in nearly every casual restaurant in Phoenix, and it's a really tired look. It's like at Pita Jungle where the servers don't even wear aprons with their street clothes. They might as well be grungy ASU students that are getting initiated and have to serve lunch for a day as part of it. Looks sloppy, feels sloppy. It's sloppy.  Get a little more 'umph' behind your side dishes, and you may be able to stay on the map for some time!  i will return",

    "text": "Came to Hula's Modern Tiki for the first time with high hopes just to be disappointed and let down. First, we started off with a small appetizer, the Abalone Style Calamari. I've been to numerous restaurants/bars and ordered calamari and have never been so displeased with an appetizer like the one they had served. Slimy calamari strips that were piled on one another with a lime-ginger cream sauce and soy glaze. They really should consider, renaming it \"slimy calamari strips\" or something. Second, to go along with my appetizer, I ordered one of there signature cocktails which was the \"zombie.\" This cocktail was watered down with ice and hardly had any flavor \"just not worth it\". Last, the entree; Teriyaki Rib eye Steak. When you order a steak, your hopes that, it's a whole steak. Instead at Hula's, you end up again with strips. This time around your steak is cut up in strips and served in a teriyaki sauce (what am I? Five?). I just don't understand why a steak is served in strips. With all that being said, the staff was friendly and our waitress was exceptional. Note: Bartender and Chef need to try harder.",

During our trip, we enjoyed all parts of the restaurant:  -the dining area (retro modern and industrial; great to overlook the outside patio) --the bar area (awesome lighting and display case of tiki tchotchkes, also in view of awesome hexagonal window thing) --the outside patio (awesome rock fire pit for sitting and drinking by)  So that's just the rad decor...! The food is good and drinks are AMAZING!! There's a menu of about 7-10 tiki type drinks including standards like the Mai Tai, Painkiller, and Zombie... and a few other non-standards (no frozen drinks)... but they run ~$7 and they come served in either a fun tiki glass or class Hula's highball. I had the Dr. Funk, Lillikoi Margarita, and Hawaii 5-0... all excellent, but for different reasons. They also sell cute collectors mugs for $6.  in any event, this place has only been open 4 months... so keep this place in business. go there... go there, now!",

I had a Jawaiian choice which included jonny cakes....something that I haven't had since my momma stopped making them for me!  These were a close rendition but I will not let my momma know.

Trader Vic himself would be proud of this little urban tiki joint.  I will keep it simple today and address the big 3 restaurant components one at a time.  SERVICE  Attentive and happy to have us from the moment we walk in the door, the first time was a mellow Tuesday afternoon.  The bartender/server was engaging and helpful and most of all ,exuded a great pride for his place.   He had a key element you just can't train into staff - Pride.  He was proud of his drinks, his menu, the whole place.  He must have got this from the owner who took time to give us a mini tour and talk about some of the unique and creative design elements.  (in a moment)  On a later visit during the more jumpin' late hours that same excitemnet to be there oooozed from the entire staff.  Refreshing to be in  place where people want to work.  FOOD AND DRINK  The Pork Sandwich was very good and so was my wifes salad, the drinks were authentic yet creative and I can honestly not say a bad word about anything.  I have seem some luke warm response to the food at Hula's.  I believe this is unfair, the food is more than fine.  It just isn't the first reason why I return.    ATMOSPHERE  Unique, creative and original design make this place interesting and fun.  On our mini tour we saw the amazing glass front bar, welcoming huge wood common tables, and stellar use of various materials all coming together perfectly.  The patio was open and comfortable.  We were on a little 1 hour vacation it seemed.  The kind of place that keeps you there once you are in.    For the local downtown-istes, it should be a mainstay of your circuit.  For those of you in the bookends of the valley who only leave your bubble for a ball game, put this on the list of places to hit on the way home.  I will probably see you there.",

We sat outside next to the outdoor firepit and it was the perfect environment.

Plus, how much better does Tiki Time sound than Happy Hour?  You can get that anywhere.  The salads are worth skipping, but everything else on the menu is outstanding.  If you're feeling healthy-ish, grab the black bean burger.  It's better than most hamburgers.  And of course get the sweet potato fries.  Other menu favorites are the spicy edamame appetizer, mac and cheese, and the Jawaiian Jerk Pork plate.  Save some of your diabetes for the coconut banana cream pie.  Whenever the weather permits, be sure to sit on the patio.  Warning - it will be hard to leave.  And if it starts to get chilly, snag a spot by the firepit.  Or just up at the bar.",

Dr. Funk is a must-try, and I love how it's served in a Tiki glass. Blood Orange Martini is by far my favorite though. Such amazing flavors! Never have had a problem with service here. The only complaint I have would be about the size of the appetizers for the price. But that's why I stick to happy hour :)",

We had iced tea, poinsetta mimosa and two appetizers - I forget what they were called but one was fish with tortilla's and the wonton's - both were very yummie. Not a great place for being able to carry on a conversation at the dinner hour, but great place if you don't need to carry on conversations across the table.",

I would definitely recommend this place!",

Went back to Hula's after we already had dinner just for drinks on a very busy Saturday night, because I love their fu-fu drinks, and got kind of forgotten about whilst already seated and seeing another party right next to us get served even though they sat after us. After telling the hostess we would like some service, the manager came out and apologized profusely, 6 times in fact that night, he said drinks were on him. When the bill came out the waitress said that our whole bill, 4 drinks, and two appetizers were completely comped. I tipped her 15 smackers though, as she really was trying to keep up, but this huge banquet table that was there before us all wanted seperate checks--The nerve! oh well that makes my bill comped twice at Hula's...Well I'll still go there again for lunch or so. I just love my Hula's and the atmosphere is to die for.",

    "text": "In two visits to Hula's, I feel it is a strong two star establishment and there are several reasons why I feel this way.  Food quality seemed good, but menu items I tried were fairly bland and not very interesting, though I do find this holds True at many \"hawaiian\" restaurants. Drinks here are stiff and during happy hour you can pick up a nice buzz for very little money, and this is a plus. The restaurant is nicely designed and modern feeling, hence the name Modern Tiki.   Televisions here, I'm assuming, are reserved for 50 year old batman movies, cartoons, and Hawaiian videos, since that's the only thing I've seen on the screens. I never understand movies in a bar with no sound, they don't make very good background ambiance as they are designed to be heard and draw you in. If sports were on, it would be great because you can glance up every now and then between conversations and see whats going on. You don't have to watch a whole plot unfold.   My last visit, after a day of mountain biking with a friend on Squaw Peak, we stopped here for happy hour and sat on the patio. They turned on the fire pit for us and even though we were seated next to it, it provided little warmth. The fire pit did however overwhelm us with the odor of propane burning. Oh well. We asked to split the bill, mine card and my friend's cash. We handed the it to the waitress and I said \"put the remainder on the card\" yet she came back with two separated checks... both charged to MY CREDIT CARD. I asked why I would want the bill split up on my card and where the cash went. She said she thought it was a tip ($13 when the bill was $22) and I said no, you were supposed to take the cash off, then put the rest on the card. Please refund my card the amount of my friend's meal, and apply his cash toward that. She argued thats not right and refunded both meals on my card, took the cash, and said we were good to go. I signed the bill but I wonder if I was ever charged. She was doing her business a disservice with her awful, awful, serving skills.  On another visit, the bartender spent my entire time there acting like he was too cool to be at work, I was bothering him by making him do his job, and I wasn't welcome to sit there.  This could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food. For now, I say it's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks. Service and friendliness is half the battle though. Unhappy/dumb as rocks staff = unhappy customers.",

It was my birthday yesterday and my pick of places to go so i picked Hula! i LOVE, love, love this place. i was lucky girl got the same waitress from before, and her name is Ginger, ask for her, beautiful, on the money with service and sweet as can be. though i am sure all the staff is like that.  I got to meet the owner Dana, he is the warmest, sweetest man alive, really! i adore him!  We sat outside it was beautiful, the patio had a great mix of all kinds of people, i love that, and someone had there doggy there and i really LOVE that part! I had drinks of course and there is no better place in town for drinks, hands down! They are strong, sweet and will make you go home and do dirty birdy stuff for sure!  Dinner!!! AMAZING!!!  I ordered fish and picked it prepared jerk style, it was sooo good, i have never had jerk style sauce but highly recommend it. it came with rice and plantains and some thing called johnny cakes i think? it was kinda like cornbread but even better i could eat it everyday!  My b/f got the jerk chicken it was so tender and moist and all the flavors blended well together, amazing, i may have to get that next time!  We also had a half order of sweet potato fries before dinner, HEAVEN!! and a half order was HUGE, we took some home with us as well as some of our dinner. the sauce that comes with them is sweet and tangy, get them!!!  We also had banana cream pie. it is not like the kind you get in the store It was so damn good! it had a half graham cracker half chocolate bottom, then the banana cream part and bananas on top, my mouth was happier than it had ever been!  Everyone NEEDS to go here, you will love it and walk away feeling full and part of a caring family.  This is hands down my favorite place to go in Arizona!  Ohh and i have yet to try Sunday brunch but am planning on it very soon! i wanna take doggies with so they can enjoy as well!  Say Hi to Dana while your there he will treat you so good, he took VERY good care of me, Thanks buddy!!xoxoxox  Go, right now! this second, ~   ALSO..For the reviewer Patti S....   Harsh, harsh, harsh..I had the Same DRINKS YOU HAD AND THEY WERE FAR FROM BITTER..REALLY? BLOOD ORANGE HAPPENS TO BE ON THE SOUR OR AS YOU PUT IT BITTER SIDE..And the Pinapple taste was there, i had PLENTY of drinks and i tasted it..  There is no way that you can even begin to say the rice was screwed up, really/ i had the same rice you had and it was perfect, maybe because it was not made from a boil in bag you did not realize what REAL rice is..  Please people disregard patty's review, it was her first one, and she is a snowbird from probably south Dakota this place is rocking and happening, and anyways who uses the word ucky/ i would not trust a review from someone \\that is that bland..Yeah go back to Trader Vic's nothing like a nice chain restaurant, maybe hit Denny's in the am for breakfast...I give it 100 plus stars....you wanted to try something real and not a casserole and you were far from your safety zone Patti s, that's all, plain and simple...",

The drinks were great, however we weren't thrilled with the appetizers.   We had the sweet potato fries. They were under cooked, not good at all, and not even comparable to Fez's.  We barely touched them.  We had the Shrimp Rolls and the Fish Cakes.  The shrimp rolls were fair, a little greasy though.  The fish cakes were tough and tasteless.  They could have been silly putty cakes for all  I knew.   We also had the pulled pork tacos. They were fair, although they were served cold.   Maybe it was an off night.

The sweet potato fries and mac and cheese are awesome too. Pretty much everything I have eaten here is good and I have had many of the menu items.

The appetizers were the weakest part of the meal: the coconut shrimp rolls were ok, the ahi wontons were disappointing, but the poke was tasty and the sweet potato fries were delish.   The best entree by far was Duke's Luau Pork Plate, a delicious blent of sweet and salty on well cooked, extremely tender pork...yummm. The Steak Sandwich was also a treat. Disappointing was the Jawaiian Pork Plate (good, but not nearly as tasty as the other portk dish) and the fish tacos (also ok, but the same fish tacos you can get anywhere. Dessert was good but not mindblowing  So, why 4 stars not thee? Weeelllll....members of the DC voted to award an extra 1/2 point for delicious drinks and a nice happy hour. And, anothe 1/2 point for ambiance...the outdoor patio is a great place to hang and the sliding door provides a nice indoor/outdoor space.

We were looking for a good scorpion bowl, and we found one here! The scorpion bowl is excellent and I would recommend people to try it. The reason for the lower rating is the food. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and wanted to try the Hawaiian Macaroni Salad. She asked the waitress about it and was told that this was homemade and tasted sweeter than a regular one and was very good. The salad we received tasted like it was bought from a grocery store. The only way we made it different was to use the sauce from her pork on it, which then gave it a good flavor. Otherwise you can get the same thing from Safeway.  The pulled pork was good as were the sweet potato fries. We may go back again, but would not order the Hawaiian Macaroni Salad.",

A google search turned up Hula's in downtown Phoenix, so we decided to try it out.  We have been back many times since that first visit, and have always enjoyed it.  The Mai Tais are great, the coconut shrinp roll appetizer is my personal favorite, and I have yet to order anything from the food menu that I have not liked.  We enjoy the kitschy mid century tiki atmosphere as well, and the old movies played quietly on the upper wall after dusk are kind of a kick.  We were excited to see the Scottsdale location open up, and tried it out twice.  It's okay but does not have the vibe of the original in Downtown Phoenix, so we will continue to make the trek.  Keep it up Hula's you have a great place and we will keep coming back!",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that (1) we did not have a reservation and (2) one of the busiest nights for restaurants, Thanksgiving eve. However, we called ahead and were told that they would try and accommodate us if we were willing to wait. And wait we did. When we arrived there was a large party occupying a table on the patio and were told that although they might be a while, we could have that table when they left. We spent 2 hours having cocktails and appetizers in the bar. When the table left, they re-set it and immediately sat two other groups even though they knew we were waiting! The manager, Kyle, knew we were waiting as he was the one I spoke with when I called, when we arrived and while we were waiting. After we complained Kyle's story changed and he said they had reservations. Not what the hostess told us when we arrived. You should have at least checked your stories first Kyle. When he realized how upset we were he set up two separate tables inside where our group would be seated apart.   Thanks for nothing Kyle. Not how I would expect a manager to handle customer service. With so many options up and down the Central corridor, it's pretty incredible that you were willing to alienate 12 customers who were already in your establishment and spending $. You let us walk right out the door. By the way, we were calling other restaurants from your own bar and several were very willing to accommodate us which we promptly took advantage of. We will not be coming back although Keith was awesome as our server. Again, with so many options in the area, Kyle is not someone who Hula's should have representing them.  Update following Dana's response:  Dana, we did not request the patio, in fact not our first choice since it was cold and although the music was good, it was loud right next to the speakers.  We were told that we could have that particular table once they left if we were willing to wait.  Knowing we were a big group o a busy night we were willing to sit outside and also willing to wait.  And we were ordering drinks and appetizers while we were waiting in the bar area, not just taking up space.  We took an area in the bar that we were told we could have but only until the next party arrived.    Again we were trying to work with Kyle because we were told we would be accommodated if we waited.  It was not until I questioned his seating two other parties at the table we were told we could wait for that he \"accommodated\" us, at two separated tables. I thought you would appreciate the feedback because this treatment seemed out of line. I took the time to provide you with the feedback because it is always our preference to support local businesses and I thought you would appreciate knowing how we were treated. Your response seems to deflect back on our group.  Clarifies that this was not a one time experience but more the Hula's approach towards customer service.  Not the response I would expect considering the increasing Central Phoenix options. Thanks for the response.",

The pulled pork was greasy and inedible. The coleslaw tasted like mayo and was warm. This was the first time I've ever sent a meal back. It was that gross. The server wasn't in the least apologetic or surprised the pork was sent back.  At the servers suggestion we ordered Mai Tais and were unimpressed. We also ordered ahi tacos, the ahi bowl and the spicy chicken bowl which were all just ok.  There were flies landing on our food throughout the meal.  There was a table with 6 tipsy ladies that were so loud we could barely carry on a conversation at our table.  With all these issues, I won't be returning.",

    "text": "The Mrs. and I relied on the other positive Yelp reviews and were not disappointed with our dinner at Hula's.  Our evening started off with a flavorful and fresh Island Style Poke appetizer.  She chose the Hawaiian Style Pork Platter, similar in texture to pulled pork, but with the flavor of the islands in the pineapple and tasty sauce. I had the Hapua, encrusted with coconut.  The fish was very light, tender, and fresh tasting.  Rice and cole slaw accompanied our main courses and the cole slaw was especially good. The service was attentive and drink refills were plentiful. This is a great place for a date night...puts you in a tropical mood. Prices are reasonable for the high quality food here.  We'd love to go back to try more of the menu items next time we're in Phoenix.",

Took our drink order immediately along with our appetizer order. Our food and drinks throughout the night were out in minutes. As a chef the quality of food was great, you can tell they take pride in sourcing fresh ingredients. I ordered the vegan bowl and that's another reason this restaurant is so great. They offer vegetarian and vegan friendly options that go beyond a salad and grilled vegetables. We will be returning again very soon!",

The drinks are good-it's a polynesian place, so definitely a lot of Mai Tai action. I can usually only have one because they're so sweet, but luckily they have wine, beer and a full bar as well. And the food?! OH THE FOOD!! So friggin' delicious! My go-to is the Mango Chicken Ceasar, but I suggest you try something new for each visit. They're BBQ Rib Dish is delicious.

We sat out on the patio in the cooling autumn air -- not cold enough for the fire pit to be lit, but we sat near it, anyway. We were delighted to see that the patio is dog-friendly. We decided right then we'd come back with the dog!  It's not as \"kitschy\" as I expected, but there were Tiki glasses along one wall and Tiki sculptures, so I was happy.  It's a very pleasant atmosphere, both inside and out.  Very open, and this is the perfect time of the year for going.   We ordered drinks and an appetizer while we examined the menu. I had a Hawaii 5-0, while my wife had a Painkiller. Both were very tasty (and strong!). Well mixed.  Our appetizer was the Abalone-style calamari -- and WOW, was that delicious! I don't know what all was in the sauce, but it was just fantastic, with the pineapple salsa. I could have eaten twice as much.  For dinner I had one of the Hawaiian specials, the Loco Moco -- a sirloin burger on rice with mushroom gravy and fried eggs on top -- not for everyone, I'm sure, but I loved it. I had a side of macaroni salad (not as good as some Hawaiian-style mac salads I've had, but still good).  My wife had shrimp tacos with fried plantains, and determined them quite good.  The portions were very healthy and there was enough to take home for lunch the next day.  We're definitely fans, and we will be back! Thanks for a great anniversary evening!",

All they did was scrape all the cooked onion off, which they missed most of it and served it. The lettuce looked old as hell, had brown on it everywhere. I eventually gave up and had them take it back. I was just about done eating, lost my appetite. They ended up making a new one which wasn't medium like I asked, it was fully done, but at that point I had enough.

The food is always hot and fresh, the wait staff and bar tenders friendly and helpful, and there's a fun open air layout.   The pork tacos are phenomenal, although I'm not crazy about the black beans and rice on the side.  We moved out here from Florida last May, and out that way we're far more used to yellow rice with our black or red beans, so it's merely a matter of personal preference.  The food is prepared exceptionally well.  Tonight I tried the spicy Asian wings with a side of regular fries, which were even better than I expected. When it comes to drinks, the Dr. Funk is our favorite so far, but there are plenty more we have yet to try.   Overall this is one of our new favorite restaurants in the greater phoenix area, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I personally prefer the new Scottsdale location, but you can't go wrong with either!",

What a great lil place, love the feel of it, makes you feel like you stepped out of Phoenix and are now at some island bar, I loved that they even had Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii playing up on the wall.  They have some pretty awesome happy hour deals, and on Wed happy hour is all night long. I ordered the Pink Bikini Martini which was pineapple infused vodka, sweet & sour & watermelon liqueur, garnished with a pineapple & cheery, this was a sweet lil drink, so very good! I also tried the Mai Tai, which was pretty good too, but I think the Pink Bikini is my favorite drink their so far! Also tried the coconut shrimp rolls, and I normally am not one to would pick a shrimp dish, but it said it came with a pineapple horseradish dipping sauce, I love pineapple, I love horseradish, so I had to try it!! They were very tasty and packed with shrimp, there was no shrimp shortage in those, and coconut gave it the perfect crunchiness! Very yummy for sure!

The tacos are so good; I've had them all! The only other dish I've tried is the mac n cheese (I'm a self-proclaimed mac n cheese connoisseur) and it was very dry and burnt - DO NOT ORDER IT. Then again, I'm hoping I had a bad batch. The staff is awesome and I feel like I always see the same people working, which says a lot about management (thumbs up!). Oh, and they play old school movies on the big screen in the evenings, but you can't hear the dialogue. Overall, it's a really neat place.",

    "text": "Since we have been to their Scottsdale location a few times and loved it - we of course had to head to the original! We opted to sit at the bar and enjoyed that they had the patio completely open so we could enjoy the amazing night despite not sitting outside.  We made it a point to head out on a Tuesday since it was 2 for $20 appetizer and drinks night.  Of course we went with the staple Dr. Funk for our drink (couldn't pass it up) and I had the coconut shrimp rolls, while he opted for the wings and added on the small fries ($4).  The food was great, the projector on the side of the ceiling was fun, and the ambiance overall was a winner.   The only off thing at this location was the bill.  We got our bill and the bartender ended up having to explain what was done. It looked like they rang up our food and drinks and then rang up the $20 deal, so our total was originally $68 dollars, of which they took $38 off in discounts, which was still off, since with the two app, two drinks and fries it should have been $24+ tax, not the $30 it was after all the odd line items.  We are guessing that something wasn't accounted for in the discounts? It was too confusing to argue over the extra money since we weren't even sure where the mistake was!  Overall: A- As expected the food and drinks were amazing, the staff was friendly and ambiance was great (really cool patio, funky window facing out to a church, projector movie on side of ceiling, etc.).  Only downside was a confusing bill, but sincerely doubt that will prevent us from returning again and again!",

I would also recommend the ahi eggs Benedict. The Cajun hollandaise sauce was lighter and more flavorful than other eggs Benedict.   The drinks were a lot stronger than I was expecting (which is not a bad thing at all). Our group of three avid drinkers got one of flaming bowl drinks to share and we at the perfect level of drunk while eating our food. The resurgence of tiki bars is something I don't personally don't grasp however this modern take on them is very conducive to a boozy brunch.",

Service was very friendly and pleasant. The menu is pretty big with a lot of choices! I always get the spicy Thai chicken bowl (it's seriously drool worthy) but tonight I decided to try their seafood. I ordered the mahi pan seared (no sauce) with veggies and plantains (I ALWAYS order the plantains, they are a must). My order came out wrong and I ended up having to wait another 20 minutes for it to come out correctly.. by then most of my party had almost finished their food. I was a little underwhelmed by my food mess up but it came out perfect the second time. Fish was very fresh, large portion, veggies were seasoned just right and the plantains are always delicious.   This is a great spot to bring out of town guests, it always wows them! I always leave hulas with a happy belly!",

Anyway her cleaning it made it smell way better than the first time I came it. It's great she helped.  The restroom looks cool, (men's) I like the walls.  The urinal is short like for kids though. :(   Food came fast which it always great.   Scorpion bowl is always great, glad they kept that!!!

This place is THEE best brunch venue I've EVER been to!  I ordered the plantain French toast with eggs, bacon and hash browns.  Don ordered the Mahi Eggs Benedict and some sausages.  Oh, we also ordered a Painkiller cocktail for good measure.  The food was abundant and tasted incredible!  I ate everything on my plates!  Don has been talking about those Benedicts for days!   The service was impeccable, the tiki mug selection was great (and affordable) and the tiki decorated room was rad!   5 solid starts from this foodie!",

Their spicy tofu tacos were such a delicacy that I crave for it out of nowhere just because the texture of the tofu and the seasoning were prepared so perfectly. Not only that, but their rice was literally the best rice I've ever tried! It was so soft and that is exactly what I love about rice! Not only that, but was there a hint of coconut to it? I've been told Hawaiian rice contains coconut. My parents recently went to Hawaii and fell in love with their rice because of the hint of coconut in it and have tried to remake it in the same flavor and texture but have been unsuccessful. Maybe I'll take them here one day to see if this place lives up to their expectations of Hawaiian rice!",

We ordered the Cesar spicy shrimp salad with extra shrimp and also another entree and they split everything for us without a charge! The salad is refreshing the shrimps are firm and tasty with lots of Cajun flavor. I wouldn't say it's spicy haha but delicious YES!  The lemongrass encrusted salmon was bomb af highly recommend it.

    "text": "Hulas has been one of my favorite restaurants for quite some time. When I heard they had opened a new location, I definitely had to come and check it out. Parking at the new location seems fairly limited, but they did have a valet to hopefully alleviate with any parking woes there might be.   When I arrived, I was promptly greeted by the hostess and shown to a long table that would be ideal if I were there with 20 of my closest friends. Instead, there were 5 of us and I would have rather had a booth or smaller table for our party.   Since it was Wednesday, they had all night happy hour. Drinks and apps for $6 is a pretty great deal, particularly since you get generous servings with the appetizers.   Ordering my first beverage was no problem whatsoever - I got a Tiki Bastard and it came out promptly. As the rest of my group arrived, we were able to put in our first round drink and food orders. As the night wore on however, our waitress didn't seem to come back to check up on use quite as frequently. I had to wait quite some time before I was able to catch her to order my second drink.   Other than that, I split the Asian BBQ wings, sliders, fries and a key lime pie with a girlfriend. The wings were tangy and sweet and perfectly crisp. The sliders while not the best, you get 3 for $6 during HH so cant really complain. The key lime pie had a crispy crust but I think could have used a little more lime flavor.",

    "text": "This was the site for the first ever Back to Drinking UYE. Yelp friends getting together for happy hour. Wednesday is all day happy hour at Hula's so that is why Wednesday was picked this time. I called them a day before to let them know we were coming and they had no problem reserving a spot for us. I have never been here before but I have always wanted to try a Tiki place and had heard good things about this place. Everything I had heard was True. This place is great. I like the decor a lot and the Elvis movies projected on the wall was pretty cool too. I didn't even realize there was a whole other sit down area on the other side until just before I left. The staff was very nice. Our waiter, who's name I didn't catch, was very good. As people showed up he came over with ice water and asked what else they would like and was always checking up to make sure everyone was ok. They had reserved a long table for us across from the bar and we had 12 people show up all together. Good turn out for the first one. I like the fact that they have Longboard beer on tap. All the appetizers were very good and the drinks were good too. There were a few drinks that I personally didn't like but that was just me. The Hawaiian Ceviche was the the first app out of the gate for me. A white fish with coconut milk, chili, cilantro and garlic served with giant wonton chips. That was so good. Great way to start off and it keep getting better. Next was Spicy Thai Fish Cakes. The white fish again with cilantro, chili, red onion, fish sauces and ginger. Very tasty. Then someone said potstickers and I love potstickers so had to get some of those. When they came out I noticed that they were fried and that worried me because some times places fry them too long and they get very tough but these were just right. I probably ate too much and drank too much because the bill was a little high but I had a great time and so did everyone else. I wasn't to thank Hula's for putting up with us. I will definitely be back and want to try more than just apps next time. I love the Tiki glasses too. They whole night was awesome and I want to thank everyone who came out. I can't wait for the next Back to Drinking UYE. This place goes on my new list of favorite bars.",

    "text": "A year or so ago, I wrote a review after visiting Hula's that was not favorable. I didn't think I would ever give the place a second go. Tuesday night, however, another couple suggested we meet up for drinks there. I had been laid up for two days and was feeling better, so getting out of the house seemed really necessary, and one good thing Hula's still had going for it was that it was walking distance to my house. Another good thing it still had going for it was the drinks. So, distance and drinks in mind, the boy and I decided to give Hula's another chance.   I don't know when it was in the past year, but Hula's radically changed their menu. There's still fish with a variety of rubs and some BBQ stuff, the menu seems twice the length. Once I realized the menu was so different, I decided I had to try the food, so I went with the Seared Ahi Tacos, part of their Labor Day special, and it was like a complete 180 from my memories of last year. Even the rice was ten times better. The other couple we were with had split a steak sandwich, which they loved,  including the salad that came with it. I wasn't hungry enough to eat both the tacos that were on my plate, but I wished I was. SO GOOD!  I also had the Hula's Hurricane, which I picked because it was the only drink that didn't have syrup or seem like it was mostly juice, but it was good. After a couple rounds, we decided we needed to try the scorprion bowl, which comes out lit on fire, so that's obviously a win. It's pretty sweet, but very tasty, and gets you in exactly the right mood to decide to go to Rosie's for karaoke.  The service was an issue last year, and to some extent still is. Our server was really nice, but we had a couple of empty glasses for a while, and I hate waiting to get a refill on a $8 drink. A couple of times the bartender brought our drinks over, and he was nice, too.   I'm really happy I decided to check out Hula's once more. I love the MCM vibe, and that patio is perfect for our 79 degree autumn nights. With the changes in the menu and quality of the food, I'll definitely be hanging out there more throughout the coming months. It really looks like Hula got it in gear. Add a few more attentive servers and it will be in tip-top shape for a Cen Pho restaurant.",

We went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't too busy, which doesn't surprise me for a DTPHX restaurant on the weekend. We started off with coconut shrimp rolls and potstickers, which were very good. In hindsight we probably shouldn't have gotten them though because the entrees are HUGE. 3 of us had burgers while the other had a bowl, and 3 of us took about half of our meals home (and I had mine as a drunk midnight snack). I had the cajun burger with regular fries and a cocktail which all come in adorable Hawaiian themed glasses. The service was great and the price was on point with what we received. They definitely lived up to the hype.",

I'm trying to find excuses to give more stars, but there is something just pulling back my fourth star and I think it's the sparkle. There is no sparkle for me.  The food is ok, but not awesome. Some things are done very well like the jungle sauce on the tofu or the fish on the fish sammie. But other things are not, like the actual tofu or the bread on the sandwich. Not a fan of the super sweet cocktails, and no wine specials for happy hour. To boot, I just don't get that feeling of soaking up the sweet Phoenix scene that's common to the Central/Camelback hot spot.  I always feel a little confused after coming here. My belly is full but my taste buds underwhelmed. Eager to be part of a cool neighborly social joint but not feeling the sweet CenPho vibes.

On a Sunday afternoon there just aren't many options, so I decided to finally try Hula's.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, which is exactly what I needed.  At 3pm the place was mostly empty, but it was obvious that the other patrons were having a great time.  I'm going to sum up my perfect, relaxing meal.  Blackened ahi with a wasabi cream sauce (damn good!), a bevy of island themed beverages and Dramarama playing in the background.  Could it get any better?  Now that I've sampled what Hula's has to offer I see the very real possibility of becoming a regular.  Bonus points for being within biking distance!  Thank you Hula's for giving me a mellow afternoon.  PS- Get the Blood Orange martini on the rocks.  You will swoon.",

Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in \"Hawaii-Mode\" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.  If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!  As far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)",

I've never been treated with such courtesy or respect by a business owner-- truly a changed perception.  We've received a lot and more in the way of makeup cred, and while this is not to encourage others to write bad reviews, I believe Dana, the owner, really cares about his clientele.  The kitchen has gone above and beyond to make everything we have ordered hot, fresh, and delicious.  Congrats on the perfect turnaround, guys, and many thanks for the conversation and remuneration.  Well done.  5/5",

    "text": "*This review is based on drinks only*   My sis Jacinthe & I participated in the Cupcake Crawl last night & it was a lot of fun! Hula's was the 2nd stop from 7-8pm. Their happy hour ends at 6pm Mon-Fri, but they let us crawlers have the happy hour prices, nice. There wasn't much room for us so we had to stand at 1st, ugh, but then 2 ladies left early to the next stop & we snagged their seats. We ordered the blood orange & pink bikini martinis (only $5 each, regularly $7). Both were so yummy! We also got to sample lil cupcakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes, white chocolate raspberry FTW! Since it was nearing the time to head to the next stop we only ordered those 2 cocktails, but I wish we had time for another round because they were so delicious & cheap! The only complaint we had was that it was super hot in there & we had to use menus to fan ourselves. I do have to say I love that open patio though, it would be so nice to sit out there & have cocktails in the fall & spring time. I would definitely return for happy hour & maybe sample some food!",

I had a beer and my friend had one of their specialty rum drinks that he liked a lot.  I ordered the blackened hapu fish plate that came with wasabi mashed potato and greens.  The fish  fillet was a fairly thin and I think that may have contributed to it being a little overcooked.  Overall it was a good experience.  Probably more due to being out on the patio and the good service rather than the food.",

Requesting to speak with the manager proved to be pointless. He quickly dismissed my concern and made no attempt to rectify the issue. Since half of the party was already seated we continued to wait for additional 22 minutes before being seated. Unless the food is to die for this will be my first and last visit.",

    "text": "I have passed this place many a time, mostly when they are closed. So last week after my in-home massage, it was finally the right time. I didn't feel like doing anything but eating and chilling. On our walk over the place looked very inviting. I'm a patio person, so they had me at the entry point. They have so many tables and chairs in their humongous patio! My favorite sitcom, Gilligan's Island, was playing on the tube in the bar area and the Tiki torches were lit. It was a nice ambiance with the big fire pit, kinda felt like I was in Hawaii, except for the metro in the backdrop (oh how I love thee Metro!). It was around 7:30pm and there were a few people sporadically place around the fire pit, so it was sure to be a great night.   I was in the mood for fish tacos and had the Hapu fish tacos (delicate white fish) which was served with black beans, topped with a drizzle of sour cream, both served atop white rice $13. Most of my food was served just lukewarm, but i overlooked it and piled the salt on the rice and beans after my first taste. It tasted much better with salt, even though I'm not really a salt girl anymore.   The fish tacos were kinda pricey but i figured it must be DELICIOUS. The rest of the menu was a little higher than usual, especially when the food is served by a food server with a dirty white kitchen towel slung over his shoulder. I cringed when I noticed my sisters Ceviche chips were touching that nasty towel. He noticed me notice it, then left the chips on the plate and brought out a little dish with fresh chips. That was too much for me, because in a fish restaurant you never know what kind of stuff ends up on them there rags, but it wasn't my plate and she was okay with it, so we moved on. The spring mixed salad was an instant fav, with its shredded daikon root vegetable tasting so deo and the delicious ginger dressing. It was the first time I had been served a spring mix with romaine lettuce thrown in the mix. I didn't let a bit go to waste. The fish tacos were drizzled with a sweet dressing over the slaw of cabbage and it was a little weird for me, as i'm used to having a tasty salsa drizzled over the tacos with some citrus. I cut the fish in halves and made two tacos into four. I guess for the amount of slaw the price was on the money, but I wan't too happy with the rag touching the food. Other than that a touch back when the food is dropped off might not happen so make sure you ask for all you need at the order. I will definitely be back, but next time i'm sitting at the bar.",

My cousin had told me about this recently opened place that he had only tried once before and said it should be a great choice for Polynesian food. I got the grilled fish tacos which were good good all except for the sides. They ran out of rice ( at least that was what I was told) so I asked for coleslaw  and then the black beans were still kind of hard. My cousin had the pulled pork with coleslaw and rice on the side and that was  good too. Overall my meal was ok and the atmosphere was nice. I admired the misting system especially because Phoenix is so hot. I may try it again on my next visit just to see if they improve.",

    "text": "So my wife have been here twice now. The first time, we had went close to when they had first opened and decided to sit on the patio. What a great meal with an awesome view. We had the Island Style Poke, Crispy Shrimp Egg Rolls, Johnny Cakes and Seaweed Salad. The Poke is absolutely amazing, I could eat two or three for my meal. The crispy shrimp rolls were pretty good too. I wasn't a HUGE fan of the Johnny Cakes, but that could just be my palate. The Seaweed Salad was very good, very fresh tasting.  We decided to get takeout last night, and again went for the Poke, my wife ordered the Island Style Ceviche and I went for the luau plate. As always, the Poke was phenomenal!  My wife went nuts for the ceviche. It was different than most ceviche's I'd had, it had the acid of a traditional ceviche but the also add in coconut milk to soften the acid, it was good (but I'm not really a ceviche guy). My food could have been totally awesome. The flavor was fantastic, but the menu stated sticky rice (I'm from Seatle and a total teriyaki whore, I know me some sticky rice) and the rice was not the slightest bit sticky, and not quite finished..and room temperature. The flavor in the pork was very very good, but again it was barely room temperature (and mind you, I live only a 3 minute drive from Hula so had it been hot when I picked it up, it would still at least be warm when I got home)  The slaw was very good, very fresh. I ate the entire meal, but would like it executed better next time. Will I order the luau again? hell yeah! I also spotted a luau sandwich with slaw that I may give a shot to next time.  Overall, this is one of our new favorites in the area.",

We went b/c we heard about the great HH special they do on Wednesday's. HH prices on apps and drinks till 11pm. The patio outfront looks great, cant wait to chill out there once it warms up! We sat inthe main dining area. The decor was great, old retro pics cover the walls and great tiki mugs on another. We all order our drinks and numerous app's to try everything. The food was great, very flavorful, good spice and it came out hot. I would suggest the Hawaiian Ceviche, crispy coconut shrimp rolls and the Fish cakes for apps, they were soooo good. For my cocktail I would highly suggest the Tiki Bastard, has Bourbon, Gin, Ginger Beer, lime and maraschino liquid. Not one complaint on any of it. The HH prices on all app's and drinks was a great deal. I can't wait to go back again!!!",

    "text": "This was my second experience with Hula's for brunch. Another big disappointment. I had the big breakfast sandwich. It does look really good. I ordered it specifically from seeing it on a table next to us. My companion had the hangover hash. Both were a big let down. I had the hash before so I was not surprised at that. The hashbrowns that accompanied it was I think probably the worst I have had, quite rubbery and tough. Its apparent that they had been cooked earlier in the day and kept warm until needed and maybe kissed the flattop before serving. The bread of my sandwich received similar treatment. It was toasted some time previous to serving. But by the time the bread hit the table it had lost any hint of being toasted. It looked toasted but it was soft as any plain white bread fresh out of a bag and bland. Maybe a brioche would have been a better choice. The sandwich overall was fairly bland. It could have used a little kick. Some better cheese maybe, or more flavorful bacon. Thankfully a couple slices of tomato saved the day. I will say the mimosas are cheap. Only $2 a glass. Kudos for that. Service was excellent. Very attentive. And the ambiance is great. If I hadn't tried the hashbrowns this time I may have given it 3 stars but I gotta knock em down to 2 stars due to the poor taste.",

    "text": "I have been to Hula's three times now. Third time's the charm I guess, which is why I'm finally taking the time to write this review. Most people feel more inspired to yelp when something in their experience goes terribly wrong, however, I am compelled when something is exceptionally right. (third visit) I'll tell you about the first two so you understand even more why I decided to finally yelp for the first time.  First visit-Met a friend for a drink at the bar. It was kind of early, one bartender was busy cutting fruit but she seemed nice and smiley. The guy bartender that helped us was a dud. No personality, no recommendations and had a great opportunity to up sell our ticket but missed out. We called him Dopey from the 7 dwarfs. Strike one.   Second visit-My spouse and I decided to grab dinner. It was last Tuesday night. The place was pretty slow, we stood up front waiting to be sat....when the hostess finally walked up she seemed clueless and irritated, like we were interrupting her bathroom break or something. (not a great first impression) Our server brought us waters then disappeared for about 20 minutes. By the time he returned we decided to forget the cocktails and just order dinner because we were hungry. We shared two meals, both were ok, but just OK. Spouse wanted dessert but the magician server who kept vanishing appeared with the check after our water glasses were empty and our dirty plates had been sitting in front of us for way too long. (understandable from Denny's or IHop but not a place like this) We paid,left and went to Lux instead of trying to get a dessert menu. Strike two.  Third visit-Finally something good to say. After experiences 1 and 2 I didn't care if I ever returned to Hula's but a coworker tricked me and there I was again. (too polite to refuse my coworker after I realized his choice for dinner) This time it was after a long day, I was slightly grouchy and definitely not expecting much after the last two adventures. We were greeted immediately by a smiling server. (she even opened the door for us) She sat us, showed us the \"signature\" drink menu and a \"Tiki Time\" menu. She said if we had any questions she would be happy to assist and she would return with ice water. We noticed she had several other tables that were spread throughout the restaurant but sure enough she quickly returned with water, a smile and her genuine bubbly personality (those of you who have had fake-nice service know what I mean, we can tell the difference between the two) She recommended drinks that were on happy hour so we saved money, not wasted it and told us her favorite appetizers that were sure to please for five bucks. When I asked about the beers she told me about the draft and bottle selection. I've never heard of Longboard or Drifter, she described them and even offered me samples! This chick is awesome. She recommended the Tiki Bastard to my coworker, she asked first if he liked ginger because there is ginger brew in it, he does and he loved the drink. (she is smart for asking because if he didn't like ginger, this drink would not be for him) The apps came out quickly and we had everything we needed to enjoy our time. She never made us feel rushed to decide on entrees and she was attentive but not annoying because we were, of course, talking about work. She provided excellent service throughout the entire experience and because of her we will be back. She made a lasting impression on both of us and turned my sour mood very sweet. By the way, her name is Tia. I was so impressed with the service I wonder why she wastes her customer service talent in food service but I'm sure I'm not the only guy that has tipped her more than 20 percent so it makes sense.   Other notes: The building is awesome, modern mixed with some vintage decor.  Very reasonably priced. Not sure about the music choice.  Old videos play on the wall from a projector. Neat fire pit on the patio. Service sucks unless you ask for Miss Tia.",

    "text": "This is a really neat place. I've only been for small plates but have eaten my face off. Yup. Maybe I shouldn't be bragging about that.   \"Grazes. Watch your valuables tho.\" \"Will leave no blade of grass unturned.\" \"Has the mouth of a Hoover.\"  Er - perhaps I should revise those warning labels. What I'm trying to convey is that the food here is gosh darn good. The service is always with a smile. And this place is super group friendly. This can be dangerous. Watch out! I mean, for your waist lines!  I'm going to start with a SERVER SHOUT OUT.  My most recent adventure was under the tutelage of a bomb diggity server named William G. (#68). This kid was zip zagging seamlessly inside and out to help a number of large tables. I gotta tell you something - come closer - this kid is solid gold. Waiting on groups is not like taking attendance. (Unless that involves herding cats in the dark.)   There's a reason they ask for your party to be present in order to be seated. It's so taking orders is easier. Did we do that? Nope.  Were we consistent in our ordering pace all night? Nope.  Did we have a lot of questions? Uh huh.  Did he ever break his smile? Nope.  Did he have time for me to point out a $0.50 HH hour difference on the menu for a draft beer? Um, NO. The kid was still smiling and super pleasant to boot. Gold! (Probably hates me.)  HAPPY HOUR Dood. They have four beers on tap, generally on the lighter side. (Note: Currently stocking a Koko Brown which is dark, \"coconut inspired\" which I am a fan of.) $3.50 or $4, not sure. Whatever the price it's a good deal before 6pm.  Late to HH? Can't be here by 6pm?  Follow them on Twitter for their \"Word of the Day\". You'll want it for super special pricing on drinks. (I heard you can also receive it via email.)  FOOD Holy Smoke! There are very rich foods (watch those waist lines) and delightfully healthy, small portion options. HOH so good! My photos have some of my favorites. Right now what I would give for a HH tofu or pork taco.  (Yeah, I went out last night. Need some replenishing.) $3 provides a taco that can be served into *two* portions. That rules! And it fits with my balanced approach to not exercising.   Hey! I'll get back to the gym.  Someday. Right.  Until then, I'll come drink and be merry. Here.  And, apparently at the new location that is opening in Scottsdale.  TOO MANY CHOICES!",

The decor is a bit more retro than the Scottsdale location, but the layout is just as open and the food just as delicious.  It wasn't nearly as crowded and the wait staff was much more engaged. I had to order the french toast again and another double mimosa for brunch.  I was NOT disappointed.  The toast wasn't a piping hot or crispy as I would have liked but I still managed to slaughter it. My friends also both enjoyed their meals of some sort of omelet and the eggs benedict.  I don't have much to say about it other than that as I was too busy stuffing compote down my gullet.",

The layout was nice, they had their patio but it was wet from all the rain. Inside was nice- cute decor, very trendy design.  Service was quick and friendly.

    "text": "Hula's has captured perfectly that hip, urban, midtown Phoenix atmosphere. You'll always find a crowd, their fire pit is pretty interesting, the indoor and outdoor spaces are cool, and they've got posters of old surf movies on the wall in the bathrooms. I was once inspired to try and find one of them, but wasn't able to on Netflix or Amazon. Maybe I just wasn't really that dedicated to the task at hand though.  I've been to Hula's a number of times now and only about half of my visits I was ordering food. Not to say their food isn't appetizing, just that Hulas works well as both bar AND grill, and I'm not always out during lunch or dinner. While a bit on the upper end of my dining out price range, every time I've ordered food, it was either good or delicious, but when ordering a drink, I usually stick with a vodka & soda, their other drinks just aren't for me.  Their signature cocktails are generally made with either rum, tequila, or vodka, or some mixture of two or three of them, but I've found that a lot of them are to sweet for my tastes. I'm not a real fan of super sweet drinks, and they can reach levels of excessive in my opinion. My favorite food item on their menu are the pork taco's and you can order one taco during happy hour for about $3. HH is Monday - Friday until about 6pm. I've also had their sweet potato fries, tofu taco, edamame, a Hula Burger, and their mac-n-cheese. All were tasty, and worth coming back for, but I imagine I'll try something different next time, like their habanero chicken tacos or their house made black bean burger.  Overall Hula's is a fun spot to meet with friends, but I wouldn't go here for more than one or two cocktails unless you're looking to leave with a sugar high.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

Their space on Central Avenue is unique too, with its huge hexagonal window bookending the beautiful bar; this is a building that has had many incarnations over the years.  But if you want to see it, you'd better hurry, as unfortunately, the building and its surroundings are due to be demolished this summer.  Don't worry though - Hula's isn't going away, just moving to near 7th Street and Camelback.",

Not soaked in mayo, flavor of fish coming through, spicy salsa, quality tortilla. A+  Cons: Service and atmosphere. On a relatively quiet evening we waited way too long with empty drinks to order another round, including flagging someone down. And as far as the vibes, something about the patio area felt cheap or aged, like it has been a little neglected? Can't quite put my finger on it...  Also, no blended tiki drinks was a major bummer. I asked and this was due to not having a blender. I'd recommend the bar upgrade to elevate the options on tiki drinks.",

The menu has many options that should suit all dietary preferences including sandwiches/burgers, Hawaiian  style plate lunches and fish creations. I always go for a fish entree, where you choose your fish type and preparation style, and have never been dissatisfied.   This evening I chose the market fish (snapper for $16) in the blackened prep style with wasabi mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The fish was deliciously spicy with a cooling wasabi cream sauce served on top! The wasabi potatoes were good but nothing spectacular and the vegetables did not exceed expectations but at least had a mild soy sauce glaze drizzle. The service was attentive but slightly pushy to move us out.  Overall my experience here continues to consist of great tasty food and forgettable service. It is the menu that brings me back every time and I would recommend Hulas for a casual date night or dinner and drinks with friends.",

I tasted a little of hers and it was also fantastic.  Our waiter was so nice, he even gave me a sample of the Lobster bisque. Although I did not order it, it also was good. The water is filtered ,it does not taste like poison so that was really nice as well.  I had hot tea (they have an assortment). He refilled it continuously.   One thing we noticed while we were sitting in the bar area was how clean the place was . I mean sparkling clean.  I know that may sound strange but, I was right by a corner and I noticed how it sparkled.   The more I come here the more I like it. The bathroom is spotless and beautifully decorated.

My friend B. and I were on a quest for the best sweet potato fries in PHX not too long ago, and Hula's was the clear winner! Love the aioli!   Another of the reasons I keep going back to Hula's is because of the awesome bar experience. John, the bartender, makes some of the best drinks in Midtown. In addition to Hula's mega-luau of tropical drinks, John had made me some killer \"experiments\" including a Spicy Dark-n-Stormy and an Absolut Cilantro & lime tonic.    Mahalo Hula!",

Menu is very interesting, prices for drinks and food are very reasonable, service is good. For me the only negative is that the kitchen closes a little before 11pm, an hour before bar closes.",

    "text": "So we made it to the new Hula's last night .... Correction for the last two nights and we are super impressed. Love the new layout and the food and drinks are just as fantastic as they were at the old location. Not sure if we had had them before, but we ordered had the wings and they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The first day we went for happy hour and enjoyed the best Mai Tais on the Mainland and some appetizers.  We had to return last night because the Captain's Cabin doesn't open until 6 p.m. and we had to check that out. They did a great job on the place ( both the restaurant and the cabin)   and it sounds like they are looking to do more.  If I could make a suggestion, I would say look for a Mike Fields print to add to the restaurant. Like how they used all the pictures from the old place!  Hula's did a great job coming up with a new updated look, yet retaining the friendly ambience and Polynesian flair of the old Hula's. Glad the long awaited opening has passed!",

The Portuguese sausage was extremely tasty. The mimosa was really good as well, I almost wanted to stay there and just drink mimosas afternoon. It would have been possible with how inexpensive everything was. The only negative was that the eggs weren't on par with everything else. I would definitely come back.",

I could feel the breeze, and it was just good vibes all around. Unfortunately, partway through the meal, some additional guests were placed right next to us, and because the sliding table wasn't set up very well, we ended up bumping elbows a few times, which was a bit awkward. The service was attentive and kind, and the waitress suggested some kind of tea that was absolutely scrumptious.   Food: The samurai beef sticks appetizer was DELICIOUS. A little expensive, but we loved the dipping sauce, and the beef was also well marinated. My s/o got the luau pork plate, and weirdly enough, he said it was the best pulled pork he's had in Arizona. Mushrooms and eggs are my favorite food items in the whole world, so I was beyond ecstatic when I saw the description for the Loco Moco. Unfortunately, I found the burger patty dry and the mushroom gravy excessively goopy, but then again, I've never been to Hawaii. The fried plantains were nothing special, but still very yummy.",

Careful, do not drink too fast and share with 6 people or you will be tore up!   Can't wait to go back!",

I was going to order a Red Stripe (yes! they have Red Stripe) and the bartender suggested Longboard which they have on tap. This malty beer was a joy to drink, so refreshing, it hit the spot. For lunch I had the Hula's Island Cobb, very delicious. I was skeptical about the spam but it ended up being a great substitute for bacon. My only gripe is the chicken was described as \"marinated\" on the menu which sold me on the salad but when I had it the meat was plain. My hubs had the Luau Pork Sandwich and it's truly heaven on a bun, served with yummy sweet potato fries. Both meals were large portions and we finished every bite.   We had a really good time at Hula's, great service, delish food & beer. We will be going back fo sho! Oh, and I should also mention that the silverware is now wrapped in cloth napkins. If I would have read these reviews before my visit Amy's \"fork door holder\" story would have kept me away.",

Because this was our last stop, we were too late to get the wine special, however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a (full) glass of wine.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on.  The patio was awesome and I love how the \"inside\" opened up to become an extension of the patio, or vice versa.  We were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect Arizona days and I felt like I was sitting in a good friend's cute, cozy backyard . . . with table service.  Speaking of the service, no complaints from me!  The original plan was to get dinner, but the wine, fries, and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night.  I can't wait to go back (soon, to enjoy the patio) and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews!",

Expect to see someone you know, or someone you want to know at Hula. Watch whatever craziness they have projected on the wall without apology. Order the second drink you want, you can always sit and while away a little more time.  Brunch on the patio! Black bean burger! Sweet potato fries! Moscow Mule (sub Hendricks and say yes to the bitters)! Dark and Stormies! Yum! Yum! Yum!  Tiki paraphenalia, vintage LA photos, consistently good service, modern touches in the decor, a gutted and re-purposed central Phoenix landmark building, a chic firepit, umbrellas and mist, high seats, low seats, group seats, booth seats, open kitchen, electric car charging, bike rack, lightrail access, I mean really, what's not to like?  A word of caution: if you are not in the mood for an epic night, if you must get something done afterward, if you have any reason to drive posthaste, then DON'T ORDER THE SCORPION BOWL. It tastes so good when it hits your lips. If you're not careful, we'll be calling you Mr. Toad (the morning after your wild ride)!",

And it's True, the first time I went our waitress did not appear very happy when we said we were skipping dinner and only doing drinks... and proceeded to ignore us most of time... but perhaps it was an off night for the poor girl. Despite that night, I did not give up on Hula's and have since been back numerous times (is it bad that it's pretty much weekly?).  Why I frequent:  - Best bean burger known to man. - Literally every cocktail on the menu is delicious...    and served in a funky tiki glass. - Any dish with fish can be replaced with tofu.  ...all at a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "As it says right in the name, this is a MODERN spin on tiki. So don't expect palm fronds on the walls and Hawaiian shirts on the staff. Instead, you have what looks to be a converted service station with lots of concrete and clean lines, and a staff that's all tatted up and vaguely punk.  I like this place. The patio is very nice on a hot day, with misters and a cold air blowing. The interior space is nice and open, with big tables and a clean, simple decor. Again, MODERN.  The food and drink menu was great. They are all about Happy Hour here, on Sunday it runs for something like 9 hours. Do yourself a favor, and stop in here for drinks: they have all your tiki staples (Scorpion Bowl, Mai Tai, etc.). The food is good, too. I like the tacos, and their salads are huge. Also, great prices on everything.  My one issue was that service was a little \"meh\". Our hostess didn't really seem to care when we arrived, and the waiter was a little spotty on getting us our drinks. It wasn't that busy, so I don't know how they dropped that ball.  Overall, as a connoisseur of all things tiki, I thought this place was a fun twist on the theme. It does not scream \"tropical\" or \"exotic\" but they're taking the idea and giving it a new look. I think that a lot of people will appreciate the blending of island themes with the more clean modern aesthetic. Well done.",

Apple Maps pointed out Hula's and after looking at some Yelp reviews, we hopped in the car and made a beeline for dinner.   We were sat right away and we poured over the drink menu and agonized about what to try. I went with a Mai tai (it is a tiki bar after all) and my wife had the Pink Bikini Martini. The drinks flew out of the bar and were in our hands in minutes. And they were GREAT! We also tried out the Hawaiian Ceviche, made with white fish, coconut milk, onions and other deliciousness served on wonton chips. Whoa! The fish was tender, the marinade of citrus and onions all married together into something truly outstanding.   I ordered the Luau Pork Plate and my wife had the Hapu fish, jerk style. The kitchen was on point with the pork. A generous helping of sweet pulled pork in an amazingly sticky bbq sauce with pineapple chunks filled a third of my plate. The remainder of the plate was filled with steamed white rice and Cole slaw. The slaw was a little bland, but the combination of the rice and pork was Hawaiian bliss.   The fish my wife tried was smothered in a wonderfully spicy jerk sauce and served with fried plantains, Johnny cakes and white rice topped with a mango salsa.   Our server was super bubbly and helpful in making recommendations on the menu and also asked the staff for things a \"tourist\" should do while we're in town.   Check this place out if you get a chance. Great service, wonderful drinks and tasty food. Do it!",

    "text": "I incentivize my co-workers with food and drinks. If we get through this training ahead of schedule drinks are on me or at least the first few rounds. I purposely looked up Hula's knowing they have a good HH and good food. It happens most of my Phoenix office co-workers are foodies and were stoked to hear my plan. Well under time allowed me to get kidnapped to the range, grab drinks and apps, before my flight home. Hell yeah. Enough about the reason and more about the business.  The weather was hot, but the outdoor seating still looked promising and inviting, but I was in business attire so we sat inside. It feels like a retro modern Tropical, not so much Hawaiian to me. Lunch is the happs, apparently still packed until the later afternoon, early evening.   Prices were excellent considering I bought a few rounds and the food was inexpensive, high quality. Poke was a little pricey, but it was MP. Good, but could do without the macadamia nuts.. Coconut shrimp rolls had a great pineapple horseradish sauce. Calamari had a lime ginger cream sauce which I will be emulating at home soon. Spicy seaweed salar was a pleasant offering. Perfect balance and something I think is an ingenious upgrade to the standard wakame that most places don't offer. Nice.  I wasn't a fan of the pork, but loved the sundried pesto aioli used, fresh black beans and corn tortillas. Habanero lime chicken use a taco slaw which I could have used less of. Really liked the south seas grilled hapu, and spicy tofu. Clean classic flavors most modern taco trucks don't' think is adventurous enough.   I split the Jawaiian jerk Pork plate. Yes that's pork they also offer. Also split the calamari sandwich. Yup I brought my appetite. Loved the plantains which were bright and not overfried. I'm not a fan of most amngo salsa's, but the johnny cakes were excellent, more to my liking than overly authentic kinds. I wasn't a fan of the calamari and preferred the style and sauce of the app.  Key Lime pie to round out the meal. I thought it was bland. Couldn't quite tell if they use kahfir limes, but after about a half dozen D.r. Funk's I was ready to get my funk on.   In an area most known for their Pizza, Italian this places stands out like nothing else and Arizona seems to be the new breeding ground for upstarts. Many of San Diego's chef's have opened up shop in AZ because they are ready for this sort of ingenuity. Glad I came. A few mediocre things don't take away from an overall good experience. Really the 1 star deduction was the service. It was slow, unattentive and just understaffed. Sure my drinks came like clockwork, but that's more the drunk vibe I give off.",

This will be my 2nd time here at the restaurant but it was my first time at the Phoenix location! Much different but I do love the original I believe which is the Phoenix one. Located in the heart of mid-town of lovely local restaurants. Prices are decent your wallet will appreciate you, specially if you come thru happy hour! Drinks are awesome food is fantastic! I personally tried and will recommend the ceviche, the hula's original burger is fantastic, I recently tried the Yummy Polynesian Chicken Burger which is delicious I paired it with sweet potato fries and their draft IPA! Service was consistent specially since I had a big group for a birthday! Definitely looking for that new twist guys? Well stop by Hulas, fun filled adventure into the islands is a door away! Stay cool, and stay hungry Phoenix!",

Very welcoming, modern and an overall cool vibe. My husband and I both noted we would love to come back again when the weather has cooled off and sit on the patio.   For lunch I had the Fish Taco, my husband had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and my three-year-old had the Macaroni-and-Cheese.  Everything was delicious! The fish was well seasoned. I only wished I had ordered two instead of one!  The pulled pork was sweet and juicy. We will be back!!",

All deserve second chances. I appreciate a heart felt explanation. I do not love or even LIKE negativity nor many negative reviews. This is a cool place in a up and coming area. SO I will Hula back in at a later time and see if the service is friendlier.. Maybe I will splurge and grab some of those sweet apps I saw passing my table.. Thanks Dana for your comment and message. :-)   LOVE the location and I have had brunch here with my friends who fav this place several times. Tonight before heading down to Bliss to our Dinner Club we stopped off for some pre-dinner-club happy hour. He had a martini and I had a red wine. No apps. He ordered another drink of some concoction and inquired about the app menu then opted not. We sat out on the patio. Staff was nice and Hulas was hopping. I had a yelp check in offer and the waitress refused to honor it and stated I could get Hula Bucks for next time since it was happy hour. I did point out that at no place on the yelp offer did it say that. Her attitude changed and our bill came. None of these 'Hula Bucks' were in our bill, so I asked her for them. She said at that point, \"Well can you not just use the yelp offer next time?\" Ummmmm.... ???? \" That isn't what you offered before..\" I said. She huffily gave the bucks she offered. We were on our way. Dang girl.. its a mere 10% off...Maybe it comes off her salary? Def changed my opinion. I don't want her bucks because with that... I doubt I would go back unless my friends insisted.... Hula that.",

The waitress didn't have a good idea what was gluten free and after saying \"oh, its not breaded, its covered in Panko so its ok\" I was hesitant to trust anything she suggested (panko is wheat...in case you were wondering). Then she said something had modified food starch and I was confused as to what kind of \"food starch\" it was...corn starch? wheat starch? what? so, that was out. So, I was just left with a menu with a bunch of sauces that if I kept asking questions would have sent her back to the kitchen 10 times with questions for busy cooks and half answers when she returned.   I settled on the burger with no bun, which, unfortunately I often have to settle for with this annoying allergy. At least it was one of the best burgers I've had in a really long time.  Still, I didn't go to Hula's for a burger...I wanted something different...something Hawaiian (and the burger doesn't have anything Hawaiian about it, except Maui onions.)   The burger is ground in-house and the fries are hand cut in house...delicious, but again...a burger and fries.  I really wish they had some more options or some clarity as to what ingredients are so I could have tried something else. Hula sauce, just so you know, is ketchup & mayo.   She was nice and attentive and didn't get annoyed by my questions or multiple apologies for being difficult (due to the allergy questions). Our glasses were kept full and we were served promptly.",

The inside is really nice but a little cramped, with a beautiful patio, tiki-themed decor, and even tiki mugs.    There are lots of fun, rummy, sugary drink options, some served in tiki mugs.  The food is pretty good, and pretty reasonably priced - definitely better than average bar food.  It tends to be loud and crowded and the service is a little spotty.    Mid-summer visits can be iffy.  The misters can't be on outside after the sun goes down...apparently this makes the patio slippery, but, frankly, it also makes the patio really, really hot, especially if the misters are on when you're seated and then turned off a few minutes later.  They also sometimes list items on the menu long after they've actually discontinued them (the ground ahi burger is an example - the server said: oh, we haven't carried that for ages).  Over all, a fun place to meet friends and hang out, if you don't mind waiting a bit for service, bumping into people, and gettting pretty hot on summer nights.",

    "text": "So, my most recent visit to my newly favorite lunch place was da bomb. Instead of my usual calamari sandwich and sweet potato fries I got the Mongolian beef with lime curry sauce. Now, usually Jamaican's don't fancy lime in their curry. But I had my grandmother turning over in her grave on Thursday because I really enjoyed the taste of the lime curry sauce, beef, beans and rice. I especially liked that the dish had cilantro in it, but not too much. One thing I noticed about Hula's while I was there is the music. It was loud enough for me to hear it but not too loud to hold a conversation. Our server was great. She kept our glasses filled and checked on us regularly but was not a bug-a-boo. I ate inside this time instead of outside and it made me realize how much I prefer eating outside here. I got to meet the owner, Dana, who is a cool down to earth guy. Until next time!",

    "text": "This last sunday, one of my best friends was having his birthday dinner at Hulus. And since I have never been to a tiki bar outside out Japan or Hawaii (the one in Japan was just a Hawaiiian islands bar but same thing) so I was ready to see what Hulus had to offer.   The atmosphere is not over the top tiki but it could use a few more statues. They have a nice patio area which would be nice but it was too cold to use. But lets jump to the heart of the matter, that is the drinks. Oh my. Rum is one of my strong vices. Add fruit juice and I would mostly likly drink it out of a shoe. But besides the fact that sentence shows some crippling alcoholicsm, I dont get to indulge in rum beverages very often. But they had my favorite \"Dark and Stormy\" which had Ginger Beer as the main mixer instead of juice. And this was mixed perfectly, so much so that it gave off a Dark and Tan floating illusion. I would go back just for that.   How about the food? Man can not survive on rum alone. But dammit we try,   The food was very good. Three people I was sitting next to got the Tofu bowl and raved about it. The one guy who got the chicken was also pleased. I got the Calamari burger just because I never seen a Calamari burger before. And it was to be expected. It needed to be bit more spicy and a lot more crunchy but still good, since I ate it all.   Basically....they do a great Dark and Stormy. And if that doesnt get you go then nothing wil.",

Inside we had some really good craft cocktails, one of them came in a tiki head, it was the punch I believe. Very good! Once our table was ready we went inside and began the amazing experience with TIA, our server, she was incredible knowledgeable on the menu, happy to be there, and all around created great vibes for everyone there. We ordered the beef sticks, fried plantains, pork sliders, ceviche and a few other items that are slipping my mind. Over dinner we enjoyed more drinks including the scorpion bowl which served 3 of us and came out with flaming 151 rum in the center. Truly a treat to dine here and even better, the prices were exceptional. I genuinely TRIED to get the tab over $100 and it wasn't even close!!! Thank you Tia again you were amazing and we will ABSOLUTELY be back soon!",

I happened to be at the bar on Wednesday night enjoying a Painkiller and some happy hour food with Corrie and George behind the bar. I witnessed Nurit F. disrespect a few employees, mainly Corrie. She was very intoxicated and insanely rude. She was using foul language and yelling at Corrie calling her names that I will not mention. Before she moved to the bar, she was at a big table with a bunch of women who were screaming and disrupting other guests for hours. To attack a person for doing their job by refusing to serve you more alcohol because you were clearly intoxicated, slurring your words, yelling and getting aggressive, is pathetic.  ***Think of David Hasselhoff eating a burger on YouTube drunk, but sloppier.   Nurit F., I suggest if you want to be treated like a \"friend\" at bars and restaurants, you should learn how to act like a respectable human. Your behavior is embarrassing and I'm sad to learn that you are a teacher. I hope you set a better example for the children in your classroom. Lastly, why don't you educate yourself on the Arizona liquor laws? You are lucky the cops weren't called on you. Hula's is lucky to have Corrie, I'm not sure many other bartenders would've handled your shameful behavior with such grace.   I was planning on reviewing the new Hula's anyway but I decided to do it immediately after seeing Nurit's shady review. While she was yelling at Corrie last night, she mentioned giving Hula's a one star Yelp review. We all laughed about it because she was so drunk, we figured she wouldn't remember.  I hope Yelp does the right thing and removes her review!",

Their previous location was great and it is bittersweet that they had to relocate, however, with the same concept and service this one is sure to be a success.    During my visit the barstaff was extremely attentive and helpful, and was able to quickly and satisfactorily correct a mix up with the order which was most likely my own fault (miscommunication about regular vs sweet potato fries).  Speaking of which, their sweet potato fries are excellent, and so are the regular fries, too.  But do yourself and your friends a favor and get the sweets because they are always just right.    The beverage menu was varied and fun, the barstaff quickly made on and off menu requests that were also just right.  The lead bartender suggested a very excellent IPA from the Beer Research Institute (BRI) that I enjoyed very much.  As an aside, that is the most clever beer or brewery name I've ever heard of.   Looking forward to returning and enjoying good vibes, good service, good eats and drinks again soon.",

The most recent time we went to Hula's was the most incredible experience we've had yet. We came on a Wednesday night when they do all day happy hour. As such, it was an incredibly busy evening. We were seated outside, but weren't brought water for 20 minutes. A sever named Kieth arrived outside, inquired as to our situation, and stated that this was simply unacceptable. This gentleman was clearly not our assigned server, but took it upon himself to ensure we had a positive dining experience. Keith immediately brought us our drinks and took our dinner order. Later upon asking for our check, Keith informed us that our meal and dessert were on the house and that he hoped we would come again for a more positive experience. We thanked Keith and tipped him generously for such exemplary customer service. We will without a doubt be returning for dinner! Someone please give this man a raise or a promotion!",

So parking can be a hassle especially during HH. This location does have an outside patio but no where as big as the 1st location. And it can literally be standing room ONLY during busy times.   There is a speakeasy next door which is also a part of Hulas (different name) however if you get a cocktail there you won't be able to take it outside to go into Hulas. Drinks must be drank there.   All day HH on Wednesday's (after 4p)  are great as you have many appetizer and drink options to enjoy.  Not the healthiest food but definitely enjoyable with a group of friends. Will def be back on Wednesday's.",

    "text": "YUM!   I've been recommended to go here several time and finally got a chance to. The decor is fun and modern. We went on a Friday night around  6pm and there was no wait. The table we were seated at was a little too close to our neighboring table. We could hear their entire conversation and they could hear ours. We has fun trying to figure out if they were on tinder date 1, 2 or 3.  We had trouble picking from the menu because everything sounded so good. I love the hawaiian and jamaican spices so every single thing on the menu was right up my alley.  We ordered the poke as an appetizer and it was the best outside of Hawaii that I've had.   I finally decided on the Jawaiian Jerk pork plate and my boyfriend got the fish tacos. We were both satisfied with the meal. He just wished there was more fish and less \"stuff\" in the tacos.  Side note: The jerk pork tasted EVEN BETTER the next day as a leftover :)  The reason why I am giving Hulas a 4 star rather than 5 star rating is that I think its a bit overpriced. My meal was $14 it should have been $10-$12. Don't go here if you are looking for a cheap, good meal. Was an expensive dinner for 2 after drinks.   Will return as a treat every now and again.",

It took her over 10 minutes to come greet the table. After that it took another 10 minutes until I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to make me a drink since she failed to bring it to me. Our food came out correctly, yet she didn't bring the food out to us and only asked if we needed anything after we had already eaten everything. She took forever to pick up our tab and overall just wasn't a good server. Not once did she apologize for how incredibly slow she was working and didn't have an ounce of personality.   I love Hulas and come often, but if I ever have this server again I will most likely walk out. The food is amazing but it's not worth spending money here if I have to wait forever to receive it.   Overall food is 5/5 stars, but your service needs work...",

    "text": "Deliciousness: 4/5 Happiness: 5/5  Hula's is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Who would have known that I would have discovered an affinity for Hawaiian (Polynesian) food in the desert?  This is definitely a place to eat outside. They have a big central fire-pit and a bar area that opens to their dining patio. Yes, it overlooks the light rail and busy central street, but the food, drink and atmosphere make you practically forget you are in the middle of a crowded city. The crowd is usually bustling with people of all ages. Very kid friendly too despite a decently heavy drinking atmosphere.  The food is great - easily some of the freshest and tastiest fish in town (made more impressive given how far we are from the ocean). I can NEVER get enough of the tuna sandwich. Johnny Cakes are a fun spin on cornbread, and I highly recommend ordering some to the table, along with fish bites. If you are a pork fan, the options are numerous. The sides (typically rice and beans or fries) are always a bit bland, but the sandwiches and main dishes are top notch. I know they have a brunch menu too, but I don't really remember it well from the one time I attended.  The drinks are the True star of the show. This is the only place I have been to where I have enjoyed a rum-based drink. They also have some tasty vodka creations. But my favorite is the Scorpion Bowl! 2-4 can share right out of the tiki-styled receptacle with fun neon-covered straws. The drink acts as a moat around a flame in the center. And people, nothing is more fun than drinking around an open flame.  Tiki's is a really fun and unique restaurant. I love it to pieces. Make sure it's on your list, especially if you enjoy a fruity and well-made mixed drink.",

Always open and always on the trend of making this happen.  Seasonal and daily specials so this is definitely one of those places that is worth the visit.  Hula's, like the name says, is a modern tiki restaurant.  The displays and decor are not as tacky though.  Actually well maintained and a lovely spot to to hang with friends or bring a drink date.  I love coming here for brunch!  $2 mimosas and the menu is a knockout!    We started with some spicy edamame and crispy shrimp eggrolls.  The spicy edamame made me want to drink more haha cause it was SPICY!  Loved it! While the eggrolls were crispy and crunchy from the shell. the shrimp texture mellowed it out.  I ordered the Luau Pork for my main; thought it was okay, I didn't care for the porky taste I guess, but my friend ordered their jerk fish.  Hands down I was so jealous cause it was damn good! The jerk was nice and creamy and with a kicking spice as it should be.    Overall, service was very good and food was excellent as usual.  You can't ask for anything more from a restaurant.  Thanks Hula!  - Enjoy!",

The last 3 times we have picked up take out the order has been screwed up, the only thing my husband eats is the ahi sandwich plain add avocado and it has not been plain and we have not had avocado although we paid for it. The ticket is correct but the food is not. This time I'm more frustrated because the order was incorrect, they did remake it, but I felt terrible for there host/take out. She is one person answering the phone seating  people and taking care of there waters. After 20 min which is ok if I am eating in they bring me the sandwhich back and it's plain with avocado but the side is not there.  I don't know how management or the owners can prevent these problems but once in a while I would like to have my order correct.",

I absolutely loved the Hapu fish (Lemon Encrusted style) dish, extremely light and buttery fish, with a nice crunch to the skin. Great saucy flavor, a slight tang of pineapple and lemon, but nothing too strong. It had a nice side of cole slaw and rice. The One Eyed Pyrt was my drink ($5 happy hour!), and it was a good rum drink, which it had more alcohol though, kinda felt like I was just drinking fruit punch after a while.  Kris liked the Jamaican Jerk, but it was more like a curry styled dish, slightly spicer and style than he had envisioned. I guess I'm glad I picked a fish dish and not his dish since his stomach was trying to handle the curry hours later.   Sadly, I was still hungry after my meal ($44 for the both of us), and was hoping for a little more food... but the actual quality and taste of the food is 5 stars, just falls 1 star short because of quantity. :/",

I'll be trying to recreate those flavors when I get home. The black beans along side were fantastic as well. Daughter got the Mongolian beef - was different than others we've had, but still delicious. Tender chunks of meat, sauce was lighter than others, but very flavorful and enjoyable. They also had some off menu kids options, like chicken strips and grilled cheese, which was a huge help with our little one. Large menu of fruity drinks, served in cool tiki glasses, and a large wine list. Will be back next time we're in town!",

I had been there once or twice for a Sunday margarita - and the Happy Hour would certainly entice me back - but we had never been for dinner or any longer than a half hour. We got a great spot by the fire which we absolutely loved! Such a nice touch for the patio. The patio environment is really open and the music we found to be perfectly balanced, too.   Now...the service? Eh. That alone made me want to scrutinize but....the food? Out of this world. We over ordered (our typical fashion) and every single thing that we got was fantastic. Great portion sizes, lots of options, amazing drinks, and sweet potato fries that will leave you wanting more. And with an ice cream store next door, I'm sold.   Our server was really great but we wish we had seen more of her. The food runner girls who did a bit of the work were certainly less than accommodating. Dairy based cream on the black beans? Ew. Put it on the menu so I will know and don't complain when we politely ask for another bowl without it. But, I have no complaints about our server in general. She was very sweet.  Can't wait to go back for Happy Hour! I'm a fan.",

    "text": "I already loved Hula's before even stepping foot inside. I am a sucker for for anything modern, yet quirky and isn't afraid of using a colors besides various shades of \"brown\" .   That being said, my rating may be slightly influenced by the night as a whole rather then Hula's alone - is that allowed? Ah f*ck it, here goes.   The first visit to Hula's was a celebratory dinner/drinks with our realtor/mortage broker after a marathon short sale that finally closed. Needless to say we were ready to drink. Too damn hot to sit outside but the patio seems to be where it's at. Started off with a double Mai Tai, it was strong and tasty. The menu has lots of veggie/vegan options and we had some sweet potato fries and wakame salad as apps, both great. One double Mai Tai down the hatch we got some edamame, now all edamame is pretty much the same everywhere I have ever gotten it but this was amazing! I should point out that this was after 1.5 STRONG double Mai Tai's but the edamame had some spices on it that really made it stand out.  For dinner I got the Jamaican Jerk tofu which was simple but very good. After reading all the negative reviews on the food I wonder if I have such an underwhelming sense for decent food or everyone else is just plain wrong - jury is still out.  At this point in the evening I realize my girlfriend who is 1/2 my weight has kept pace with me and consumed the exact same about of Mai Tai's as I have - uh oh, this could get interesting. At this point we decide to head to Vertigo (if you don't know what it is then you aren't cool enough to know). Half the group doesn't make it there or passes out in a random chair while I hijack the hosts Itunes account to get some decent music playing. The night ended with a barefoot walk to the nearest light rail station and a ride home. What's my point of telling you this story? The drinks are strong, it' a fun place to meet up, and those two combined can really make your evening.   Oh, and they have good food, yeah i said it.",

I've had some pretty solid drinks here and some not too bad breakfast, but sadly, I can't even remember what I've specifically eaten or drank here the multiple times I've hung out, which is why I cannot give Hula's more than three stars.  However, I also never recall a bad food experience, and when time and chance has it, I will not hesitate to return. Especially because I always remember the crazy conversations and company I've had while enjoying time there. One time I was there with a group for some afternoon cocktails for hours. Hours. I think probably 7 tables rotated next to us the entire time we were there and our server switched at least once. That, my friends, is a sign of a great hang out.",

I've been several times at this point, and while I'll happily return when I'm in the mood for a fruity over-syruped *strong* cocktail, I will not however be spending my money to eat there again.  The first time I went with a small group in the springtime and we sat out on the patio which was a blast. Great ambiance. And two over their 151 packed Scorpion Bowls later, I was sufficiently blacked out. Unfortunately the blackout did not happen soon enough to make me forget the flavorless and overcooked Ahi Wontons i ordered.  Second time I went and ate was with Amber W. herself and I ordered the butterfish which was drenched in a terrible thing overbearing cream sauce. I asked for it pan-fried and apparently that is their definition of it- certainly not mine.  All in all, Hula's is a fun place to go, hang out, and have a couple cocktails and enjoy the patio when it's not 400 degrees out, but if you're going there with the hopes of being wowed by exemplary seafood, you will be sorely disappointed.",

Seriously, we turned up for happy hour at Hula's on their charity night (nice!) and Ronald McDonald was roaming the place.  I probably would have volunteered to donate extra money, just to avoid shaking hands with the semi-creepy clown... we're eating! I don't want to share the neighboring tables' germs!  We found a few cheap bites on the Happy Hour menu - Tofu and Pork tacos, Spicy Fishcakes, and Ceviche.  Considering we had already asked about the gluten-free status of a few items, we thought it would have been nice if our ceviche didn't arrive surrounded by wonton chips - at least mention them on the HH menu, so people know what to avoid!  I really enjoyed the pork taco and loved the fishcakes... YUM!  And I didn't even have to share them (yes, sometimes I use the Husband's GF status to my advantage).  His tofu taco was a little strange.  It had 3 HUGE strips of tofu, lightly seasoned and put on a corn tortilla that couldn't support their weight.  It would have been better with much smaller chunks of tofu, and not to over-do it.  You need to be able to pick up a taco, y'know?  Our waitress was friendly enough, but didn't seem particularly adept at her job.  She didn't know the ingredient in many items and our water glasses were sadly ignored.  So thirsty!  There are way too many spots in my Central Phx neighborhood that have better food and service, so it will probably be awhile before I venture back.",

Ever since Trader Vic's closed at the Valley Ho I have been needing a spot that will fulfill my not-too-frequent mai tai fix. I was there on a Wed night to meet up with some business buddies and the place was doing brisk business. I think they have an all night happy hour on Wed night, which was convenient. Its a cool set up especially when the weather is nice. Very open bar that leads out to a big patio with lots of seating. Gilligan's Island episodes playing on a large projector is a cool touch as well. I am a big believer that a proper gentleman knows to order margs at a mexican food joint, wine at an Italian or French place and good beer and whiskey every place else. That being said, when frequenting a super kitschy tiki hut standard operating procedure is the house mai tai. Very tasty, not too sweet and a bit boozy. I also had some HH pork tacos that were massive and pretty decent for soaking up the 5 mai tais. I would go back for the patio and the aforementioned MAI TAIS.",

Food was ok, but considering the reviews prior I was a little let down.  On one hand I can expect that things might have been off because of how busy they were but on the other hand that should be expected and planned for.   As a Chandler resident we might make it back, but we will see.",

    "text": "Hula fits into the cool vibe of uptown Phoenix.  I really like the vibe of the area and Hula seems to be a good fit.  If you can and it is not June and 176 degrees, get a good seat outside and enjoy.  Inside is a very modern tiki style (not sure, but I think I just made up a new style, but I think it fits this place).  Overall our experience was pretty good.  They have one of the best veggie burgers in Phx.  The sweet potato fries are a nice touch to any meal on the list.  The mai tai was very good and made me wish I was in Maui!  The only issue we had was minor.  Our waiter did bring us pork and before we could get the right meal he was off and I had to track him down and it took a bit to get it fixed.  That happens time to time and I will not let that cloud my judgement of the place - it is still fitting as a 3 star.   I like the area and the busy atmosphere is great on a Friday or Saturday night.  We will be back, especially for another Veggie Burger!",

The decor is modern tiki like the name says. The patio is great especially when weather permits. Their happy hour specials are great and the uniqueness of the drinks is a fantastic plus. It's always nice to sit down at a bar and strike up conversation with the guy 2 seats away as well as the bartender. The staff were definitely friendly. I wish there was one of these closer to the East side.",

The fish tacos and seaweed salad are probably our favorites. We tried the bean burger and sweet potato fries which was actually really good! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, a chill atmosphere, and great pricing. If you want to wrap up with desert they just opened up Twist next door for a great selection of frozen yogurt!",

While the hostess was a bit off the bartender was nice and attentive while we waited for our party. The drink menu is intriguing, but the 2 drinks I did have left a lot to be desired. I do not like overly sweet drinks, but both of my drinks lacked any fruit flavor which was odd considering the laundry list of ingredients in both.  Once we were able to figure out the seating situation (our party grew by one) our waitress was attentive. The menu has some interesting choices. Not being a fish lover I felt their apps were very limited- I like sweet potatoes fries but some variety would of been appreciated. I had the pork plate and enjoyed it it more than other in my party enjoyed their choices.  Overall the experience was fine. I found their prices to be reasonable and I really love the space- but I was just not really blown away.",

    "text": "My final meal before leaving Phoenix, I was turned onto to Hula's because of a random friending on Twitter.   Having been to the islands a few times, I was intrigued, and convinced my family to go, and we were happily surprised.   i got the Butterfish, done Jamaican Jerk style. The fish came cooked perfectly, smothered in a spicy jerk heavy sauce. One the side, it came with plantains, which were lightly fried( but I suspect they were actually bananas). Crispy on the outside, warm and mushy on the inside.  The rice was decently cooked, and had great flavors all throughout. Lightly sweet, lightly spicy, it was great, but certainly could not stand on it's own. The johnny cakes, while flavorful, were very dry for my palette, easily the worst part of the meal.   The shining star at Hula's were the beverages. My wife got the Mai-Tai, which was as authentic as the ones we've had in Hawaii, and perfectly mixed. Her second drink, a Watermelon martini, tasted exactly like a Jolly Rancher, if you like that sort of thing.   I had 2 drinks, the Zombie and a Painkiller. The Zombie was fantastic, dark rum flavors and passion fruit swirled around in my tiki mug, and mixed with chunks of fruit to make a delicious beverage. However, the Painkiller was much better. Dark rum, coco lopez, fresh squeezed pineapple and oj worked together to make an excellent drink. I wanted 3 more of them, but I needed to get going.   When I return from NYC, I will definitely be checking out Hula's again.",

    "text": "Every spring I travel with friends and family to Phoenix for 2 weeks of Spring Training.  Every year we go to Hula's two or more times.  Even though we all seemingly have variant tastes in food, we all love coming here.  First, the atmosphere is... (pardon me while a search for the right word).. comfortable!  We always come after dark and sit outside by the fire pit.  Fresh air, dark skies, warm fire all add up to a relaxing cozy home like feel that is just right.  The food is always excellent. It is different.  I would describe it as Southwestern inspired island food.  The service is hit or miss.  We have had some exceptional waitresses and others that have been adequate (fortunately no bad ones yet).  The crowds are a mix including twenty somethings, professionals, tourists and others.  The only True complaint I ever have with Hula's is that the staff is a LOT more attentive towards the twenty somethings than the other customers.  Since I have children in their twenties and am not twenty this can be a problem.  It does get bothersome to be by past by the waitress as she caters/dotes on the table of young people right next to us. Even with this age discrimination, I would (and often do) recommend Hula's for its exceptional ambiance and excellent food.  (the ambiance is better than the food)",

    "text": "We live down the street and anxiously awaited the unveiling of this place.  Already stoked to have Lola within walking distance,  I must admit I was less than thrilled to learn it was a \"tiki bar\".   While walking the dog, we turned into the parking lot this fine Sunday afternoon and thought, \"what the hell?...\" so we decided to stop in and check it out.    First, they are dog friendly on the patio and the dog bowl full of water at the entrance is very inviting.  Second, I like the sparse tables on the patio.  It beats the hell out of scrunching a bunch of oversize tables into uncomfortably small spaces (ahem...Oregano's).    We ordered the shrimp coconut rolls and I got a Painkiller (dark rum, coco lopez, fresh squeezed pineapple and o.j.)  Delish! Although the shrimp rolls need an extra layer of flavor on the inside (red pepper? mango?) they were tasty enough.  Great app, nice portion size, plump, juicy shrimp.  The sauce is just divine.    Next up- ahi tuna poke (aka \"crack in a bowl\").  Nice cuts of ahi marinated in a perfectly balanced soy, sesame oil with citrus hints, minced macadamia nuts, green onions and little bit o' heaven.  Seriously, couldn't stop eating it.  It was damn tasty. Tastier than toro poke at other places I've had.    Cocktail #2- The Zombie.  The tiki glass was cute, a little too Disney/Macayo's for me and way too strong with no actual flavor.  Both my husband and I were bartenders and can appreciate a well-crafted, toxic cocktail.  However, this was lacking and not sure what could've saved it.  Our server was gracious and understanding, happily swapping that for my much-beloved Painkiller.  Mmmm.  mmmm. good. Although this time it arrived with some sprinkle of nutmeg? allspice? on top....hmmm...curious as the last one didn't have it but tasty nonetheless.    Enjoying the ambiance and not wanting to leave, we ordered sweet potato fries.  Tasty and more crack in that sauce.  Ginger with some....crack.  It was just good. The fries not greasy, not too crispy, not soggy.  Well done.   On to dessert.  Husband had the key lime pie and I had the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream.  Mine was \"eh\", nothing to write home about.  I'm a brownie/chocolate cake snob.  The key lime pie was tart, sweet, creamy, nice crust (suspect it was actually homemade).    Overall, a great experience.  I love that they are in the hood, not pretentious and seem to know exactly who they are and what they want to accomplish.  We talked to the owner and this is not a \"chain\" but a collection of 3 friends who have similar concepts and invest together.  I think it's great that the attention to detail is obvious.  The space is downright lovely and it seems like a wonderful gathering for groups.  We saw several large parties (6+) handled with ease and grace.  Like any new restaurant, there are some consistency kinks to work out but I love the attitude of this place and definitely see more afternoons on the lovely patio sipping some Painkillers....hello Arizona fall.",

    "text": "This is the 4th time my husband and I have visited Hula's. We just moved about 3 blocks away and I am so excited to make this my regular dinner/hang out place. We went there a few months back for the first time. I looked at Yelp reviews and was worried... What people were saying was not very favorable. But we were hungry, it was Sunday night and we decided to try it. We were thrilled. Our fish was amazing and the Poke was to die for. Our server was great and we left happy, filled with a great meal and with every plan to return. Later I read the review in the New Times. That review made me think that the New Times might need a new food critic, as clearly the current one is lacking in good taste.   After 4 times at the restaurant I feel that I am in a position to write this review. Each time our service has been amazing. I never felt like the servers were fake, trying too hard or pushy. On the contrary, they are pleasant, helpful and so nice. I have a very severe seafood allergy and was really thrilled to be reassured that my  food did not contain shellfish. Our server double checked that our order did not have anything that could possibly make our night a nightmare. The owner came to introduce himself and was a very nice guy.We felt so welcome there. The last place I felt that kind of hospitality was at Lisa G's (sad to say, Lisa G's is no more...) The atmosphere was very relaxed and in tune with the restaurant's laid-back theme.   And now for the food... It was out of this world. The Poke appetizer has been my favorite but the fish cevice was just as good. It combined so many wonderful flavors and is now my new favorite dish at Hula's. We shared the macademia crusted Hapu. Everything was delightful. The ginger slaw was a total surprise and it worked!   If you want a great place with a fabulous atmosphere, awesome beers (they have Drifter on tap) and amazing food go to Hula's. You will not be disappointed.",

We both ordered the blood orange martinis, which I had and liked last time. They were good, and we agreed the drinks might be worth going to have. They were each $7.   I ordered the Hula's Modern Fish Sandwich, per the owner's recommendation. I enjoyed it. It is large. The fish to bread ratio is good, and the flavor is nice. There was not overpowering cilantro on the slaw on this dish. I had sweet potato fries with it. They were somewhat soggy and not great. That dish was $12. I would eat the sandwich again.   He had the Mongolian Beef Bowl without black beans. The rice was very sweet, but we knew that after last time. The meat was cooked well. The curry lime sauce does not resemble Mongolian Beef. The dish had a little too much cilantro. Because the flavor was not like that of a traditional Mongolian Beef, I would not order it again. It was $13.   The server was nice and helpful, though service was much slower tonight than last time.   All in all, we really want to like Hula's because the drinks are decent, the location is convenient and the patio is nice. However, the food is just not a huge win for us. We may return for happy hour but probably not for dinner.",

    "text": "Always have loved the vibe here and have enjoyed coming here since they first opened. Was very disappointed on our visit last nite, with a party of six patrons for a friends birthday celebration. The service was very sub par to say the least, and the establishment was not even busy. The problem seemed to be our server had better things to do other then servicing our table. For starters, she was more interested in socializing with her co-workers at the bar during most of our stay, then it got even worse when her boyfriend came in and sat at the bar waiting for her.   So here is how our experience went down. The menus sat on the table the whole time we sat at our table from appetizers to desert, with no bus service at all. Every cocktail glass, appetizer plate, main course plate were left for us to contend during our stay, even all the way up to the piece of desert pie for the birthday man. We were swimming in a china cabinet at the table. So with no bus service we also had no drink service, I had to go up to the bar and interrupt our server during her social hour a few times for our drink orders. The first time I approached her at the bar for drink service since she basically abandoned her table, she then popped back at me with an attitude and told me to give her a moment. I then had to say something to her about her lack of service, you would have thought she would have figured it out, especially when you are in a service industry working for tips. No situational awareness from the other staff to see the mess at the table and lack of service to our party. Guess they do not have each others back as a team, with no manager watching the floor? WOW! I even had to go ask her for the three checks after all of that. So far the worst dining experience of 2016 for us.  Let me say this though, as I watched the other tables and parties during our experience, I do not believe they were not having these issues, unless they had the same server I would imagine. Maybe they are not equipped to handle parties larger then four people.  Forgot to mention, the appetizers came out with the main course. So much for sitting and enjoying more cocktails during our experience. Hint Hint.",

I like to go places and cobble meals out of appetizers, which you can definitely do at this place, but the entrees are also very yum. Just eat everything.  The layout is nice and spacious, and they have a lovely patio. I used to frequent this spot when I worked in the area, and now I go because I just plain like the place. Catch a show across the street at the Torch!",

It may have been just my server, Hayley, but service was the best I have ever had. Very attentive, kind and helpful.   I normally  don't eat blackened fish as I feel the fish is too often over seasoned and overcooked, but I ordered a perfect blackened medium rare ahi sandwich. The taco slaw gave the soft almost raw warmed fish a perfect crunch. I am from Miami and never expected such a great piece of fish in the desert.   And dessert, the brownie sundae was everything I like. Warm, not overly sweet, chocolatey moist brownies with great vanilla ice cream. Papa oo mao mao to my tummy.",

I love all things Tiki and retro, what better place than Hula's Modern Tiki right. There is no other place in the valley that you can literally \"share a drink\" with some friends than Hula's by ordering a flaming scorpion bowl with long straws for everyone..   Between their own take on the famous Mai Tai and the Spicy Thai chicken, Hula's adds a twist to your traditional Hawaiian fare. To name a few entrees I have enjoyed and would order again: the  Thai Chicken Bowl is a must try, the Fish Tacos are monstrous, maybe a Pineapple Chicken Sandwich for some flavor, or the Wings for an excellent starter.  Sweet Potato Fries, Duh!! Grab a large order, you wont regret it.  If your there just for drinks and some patio time, you really can't go wrong with anything in a Tiki mug, just know your limit when it comes to a rum cocktail.. They call em' sneaky tikis for a reason!! For something smooth a cream try the Dr. Funk, it'll surprise you!! If not, stick with the classic Mai Tai, sailor.   They have weekly happy hour and be sure to sign up for their Text notification to receive specials and secret passwords. Also, look out for their other two locations in Santa Cruz and Monterrey Bay. At every location the service, food, and cleanliness has been top notch. The staff is very friendly regardless of how busy it gets.",

There is something very right about the combination of rum, coco lopez, pinapple and orange juice.  Since Hula's has all-day HH on Saturdays (ending at 7pm), these beauties will set you back only $5 each.  Bargain!  We kept telling ourselves \"hey, we burned like 2,000 calories today.  We EARNED these!\"  They came with a fruit garnish, so technically they were \"health beverages\", right?  :)  Our very cool waiter took good care of us, and even shared a little background on his detailed tattoo work.  While I don't have any ink, I love hearing the back stories behind people's art - interesting!    As the sun made it's way down on this good day, the deck, the fire pit and of course the Pain Killer elixr made all those bumps, bruises and scrapes earned on the trail just seem to disappear... for a while, anyway...",

We gave it a great try, but it just failed to miss the mark.  Apps: coconut shrimp rolls, sweet potato fries, ceviche Mains: pulled pork sandwich, pulled pork platter, hula's burger Desserts: key lime pie, banana cream pie Drinks: mai tai, hurricane, dr funk  Drinks were all awesome.  So if anything, go for the drinks.  Apps were good, nothing to write home about.  The actual meal is what i have the most issues with because I felt ill after eating it, and while the first time I though it was over indulging, my take home box of pulled pork informed me otherwise.  My body is not a fan, no matter how tasty that was.  The cole slaw they serve is quite good with the pork though; I would opt for that instead of the rice on the platter.  The banana cream pie was rich, but good.  The key lime pie was pretty bland and disappointing.  It's a small place so unless you plan on sitting outside, the wait can be a bit when they're busy.",

Every time I drink the painkillers it brings me back to Jost van Dyke where the drink was invented - the Soggy Dollar Bar.  Then on to food.  From incredible barbecued pork tacos to juicy burgers and even vegetarian fare you will not be disappointed with the menu here.

    "text": "I used to be a regular here but moving away from downtown has moved me to a new watering hole but I do miss this place.  Food/drinks/happy hour/atmosphere  I usually order the Dr. funk or the Hawaii 50 (both 5$ during happy hour) which are both great options if you like a fruitier drink, I would ask the bartender to recommend something based on your taste as they are usually nice enough to let you try it. I have tried a lot of their menu and the pork tacos (happy hour 3$) are a big stand out to me they taste like a kalua pig mixed with some great spices with a fresh home made salsa that has some spice but not much which is great. They have a great happy hour from 3:30-6 mon-fri and all night weds great time to check this place out if you are curious. The place is real laid back I have been there in slacks and dress shirts to basketball shorts and a white tee.  The bad I have had an issue with one waiter a few times (3 to be exact)in one such event I came in during their freaky tiki event where they had a buy one get one free. I ordered 2 dr funks for me and my girl who was running a bit late, he let me know that he would bring me one drink at a time and that I couldn't have 2 drinks. I explained the situation to him and he just walked off without acknowledgement and came back with one drink. We had to wait a while for him to come back as it was busy, not a very good experience but now when I go in I avoid his section so no problem. The parking is also a concern especially during the weekend but I have heard they are working that issue out. Take a chance on this place you won't be disappointed even with a few hiccups this place deserves the 5 stars.",

    "text": "What a find....  trendy, friendly and fabulous.  This is the type of place that I call home. Hula's has something for everyone with Island cuisine from coast to coast and anywhere in between but still has room for a twist of the American Burger that keeps him happy.     We found this place around the time it first opened as we were trying out the light rail.   We were not quite sure if we should go in because after bumming on the light rail all day the trendy setting threw us off.   The unique building was an eye catcher and at first we were not sure if it was a restaurant so as the explorers we are we went up to the door and then when I realized this was a restaurant we asked to see a menu.  My now Fiance took one quick look at the menu and started to walk a way and so I began to follow.  The owner Dana grabbed us and convinced us to give it a shot.  In fact he made such an impression that we have become regulars.  Dana the owner makes this place feel like cheers because every time we come in everyone knows our names.   We laugh and joke with the eclectic mix of staff who is always friendly, courteous and professional.   If that isn't enough, the prices and great food will keep you coming back.     Yes that is the start of our love affair with a place called Hula's and it hasn't ended in all this time.  You might ask me why not because I haven't gotten to the end of the menu yet nor have I gotten all the receipts.  These are the foods that you never tire of.   I have always started with sweet potato fries with Hula's own mouth watering sauce as an appetizer because you can not go their without trying this dish.  The first year I could only eat  the Jamaican Jerk plate that was so good I use to crave it all the time.  I then ventured on to their shrimp rolls and lunch portion salads with just the right amount for lunch with friends.  I have ventured even further for happy hour with the girls I tried the ceviche, crab cakes and taco's with Dr Funk giving us his blessing with a RX for the soul.  Some of my fav's are any of the Bowl dishes, Hearty Black-bean burger and the fresh fish catch of the day.   Hula's has a perfect blend of ambiance. I always tell everyone I know that they should come in and tell them we sent you.  Did you hear now next door they have a new frozen Yogurt place called Twirl?   I have been thinking about the Red Velvet every since I visited on Friday.  I'm not sure I will ever leave.  LOL     Eat, Live and Enjoy....  I know you will.",

I was at Hula's MT the really inspiring time I heard that song from the movie Rad, Send Me an Angel (by Real Life, 1989).

Wonderful island-style music that gets you relaxed and thinking that maybe there is a body of water somewhere nearby (not a chance in Phoenix). I got the chicken skewers, which were moist and came with great dipping sauce. My husband loves the black bean burger here (a great option for vegetarians). They have good drinks and good service. We have come here alone and with friends and we always have a good time. Love the location and the mid-century modern style of the place, too! Very Mad Men, if Don Draper took a trip to Polynesia!",

My favorite server in the world Tia was there, however we were in a bit of a hurry to make our movie on time, I didn't see her AND there was limited seating as it was kid of busy, we just sat where the friendly hostess told us to. Our new server was almost as perfect as Tia. I hadn't been here in about four months and I was quite impressed that Tia was there and recognized and came over and talked to us. I peeked at the lunch menu and there was an item in there that wasn't on the regular menu. And of course that's what I wanted. I asked our server if instead of the Cajun Ahi Caesar Salad, if I could have the Cajun Shrimp Caesar  salad. She (and the kitchen staff) were very accommodating. I was once again a very happy camper.",

We were allowed to pick our own seat, and our waiter greeted us promptly. I ordered a Mai tai ( the drink is strong, and I recommend it). The drinks came out quickly, and we put in an order of pot stickers. I can't say I enjoyed them too much, they were crunchy, like deep fried instead of the traditional pan fried. We then ordered the entrees. I had the spicy thai chicken bowl, and she had the pork tacos. The Thai bowl wasn't spicy, but it was HUGE and good. The pork tacos though...were much better than what I had. It made me wish I had ordered those instead. Lastly we ordered chocolate macadamia nut brownie that was delivered hot, with a side of vanilla ice cream with nuts in it. The brownies were very rich, and the ice cream complimented it very well.   The highlight for me was our server. He was very prompt with the service, gave us excellent recommendations, and catered to our every need. His actions alone made the meal.",

We had a couple themed mixed drinks and, like others have said, they don't skimp on the booze. It was raining so the bar area was very crowded but props to the bartender for finding us and providing consistent service.  Not much to be said for the happy hour specials but Hula's isn't about $2 Coronas anyways so plan on having something mixed off the menu.",

I used to live closer and we would go during Tiki Time.  I had a bad service experience and ceased coming until my wife talked me into going again.  It is what it is and I am happy to have gone back.  Hula's is one of the few places that offers \"Poke\" so this is one of the main reasons I am now a fan.  Their Poke is a different style then I am used to, but good none the less.  They also offer nice stiff drinks and have a nice selection.  I honestly have to say I have not been overly impressed with any entrees I have had, but definitely enjoy the appetizers.  This doesn't mean that I will not try more, I just have to find the right one.  I almost gave only 3 stars, but because of the Poke, drinks, and your outstanding building I upped it to 4.  I will be back and hungry for more Poke, thank you Hula's.",

I tried to keep it light, but even the light side was out of this Frickin world!    First of all, the atmosphere is awesome.  It truly is.  It is like an ultra modern Palapa.  I must've spelled that wrong because I got a red squiggly line under it, but you know what I mean.  The vibe was very cool.  Sort of Zen and the porch was part of the bar area and vice-versa.  There was a good crowd and everybody seemed to be having fun.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and just as described it was \"heaven on a bun\".  My girlfriend ordered fish tacos that she raved about.  Sweet potato fries were killer.    We sat at a community table because it seemed like the happiest place to be.  Down the table some people ordered the scorpion drink which was like a mai tai with 10 straws.  It was huge and didnt seem overpriced...especially when I saw the happy hour menu.    There were a ton of things on the menu that Ive gotta try for dinner one night soon.  Everything seemed so yummy.  Service was really friendly too.    I am dying to do happy hour here.  The bar area seems awesome!!!  Gotta  check this place out!",

Having been thrown off the light rail in front of Hula's, I decided to stop in and have a cocktail.   Nattily dressed in my silk Hawaiian shirt, I felt right at home. I ordered one of the more expensive voodoo drinks and was surprised it was served with four straws. My bartender advised it was so big and full of alcohol, it was generally shared among friends, I advised him that I share a lot among friends (including the tab) but not my drinks.   Knocking down the cocktail, I decided to cruise Hula's and check out the clientele (particularly any Hula Girls). Regaled in my authentic Hawaiian shirt, I was immediately mistaken as a waiter by the staff and diners. This led to me walking out of Hula's with $200 cash in tips. Needless to say, i will be back with another stylish Hawaiian shirt out of Condor's closet!",

Your often greeted by a man in a Hawaiian shirt with a smile and a friendly hello. If you are lucky, this is the person who will be making your drink(s), because he is one of the best bartenders in the valley. Future patrons would be wise to let him know what you like and leave the rest in his hands.   The patio is not only spacious and comfortable, but somehow shielded from the sounds of central avenue traffic. While I certainly prefer to enjoy Hulas on the patio, the architecture of the inside is amazingly well presented, as an extension of the patio.   The food is certainly solid with certain stand out menu items like the Poke, pulled pork and the ahi eggs benedict for brunch. Obviously being a bar, the main attraction are the libations being poured, but its important to have food that compliments the both the vibe and experience and Hula's achieves this with gusto.   Highly recommend this place if you are in the central corridor looking to cool down on a hot afternoon or celebrating Friday night with your friends late night.",

The Poke is great and I could eat it as a meal. Did I mention that the Poke taste like a little piece of Hawaiian heaven?  I had the blackened fish which was good. It had some mango salsa on it but I am not a big mango salsa fan so I had to put that to the side. The Poke alone has me hooked on this place.  The architecture of this place is pretty cool... It was different and a good topic of conversation when you're on a first date. Even the bathrooms are done up pretty nice. I like the tongue and groove wood panels that go half way up the wall. Very nice touch! Even the sink was unique.   The only thing I did not like were the sweet potatoe pomme frites (french fries). They were soggy... and that is a personal thing... I am not a big fan of soggy fries. I like my potatoes to be croquant (Crunchy).",

There's a large patio for those mild nights and wintertime. The best thing about Hula is their Caesar salads.  Most of the entrees have an option for Caesar salad or sweet potato fries or something else.  Please get the Caesar salad.  If you must, then go with the sweet potato fries.  Or, you can do like my friend and I, and split a chicken Caesar salad and black bean burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Not only will the kitchen split everything for you, you get the best of everything.   On the last visit, we had the two entrees and four vodka cocktails and our bill was about $55.  I'd say that's a smoking deal.   It's right off of the light rail and I hear they have an amazing brunch.  I can't wait to get up early enough on the weekend to try it!",

Okay so now having said all of this I did have a point to make ........ the food, the people, the service, the atmosphere, all deserve 5 stars as they almost always do It's not that I had anything new and exciting I had the same thing I often do the Samurai beef sticks with the Butter fish pan fried.... that's the point I'm trying to make even though I had what I've had several times before it was so on point it made me want to come back again and again and again like I said in my first review they do what they do and they do it well....... Til next time    P.S. as I had said in my last review that I hoped they were just having a bad day in my opinion that is exactly what  happened for the sole reason that my great meals have for out weighed any bad meal (as in singular)  that I have ever had at Hula's",

We had a round of Mai-Tai's which like previous reviews have stated are strong.  We actually had someone at our table request less booze which to me is refreshing.  I travel a lot and it seems like more often than not restaurants and bars are getting way to greedy when it comes to their pour.    Our server was friendly and prompt and the food was great.  Half of our party was from the island of Maui including myself and I can say we were all surprised at the quality and taste of the poke.   As a group we shared orders of the Mahi Mahi and Ahi which everyone was surprised at really how good it tasted.  Who knew there was good fish in landlocked Arizona.   I'll be coming back to Hula's when in Phoenix and would definitely recommend to friends and family.  Aloha,",

I have only been once  and it was on a date night, we started off with a cpl of the  signature drinks all of which i thought were great ( Mai Tai , pain killer, and  one eyed pirate). After having 2 Mai Tai's and a one eyed pirate  i was toasted to my surprise. I can drink a lot  but didn't need to the drinks were strong and tasted great. We only had an appetizer  which were the shrimp roles and it tasted  very fresh  and  the  pineapple  dipping sauce was pretty good.    One of the best parts of the visit was  we were greeted immediately at the door with a  smile and  the servers were very nice. When we went it was  super clean (big plus in my book) the ambiance was nice and we had a great time. Now i have only been once so i will have to go again  and  hope for the same experience.

I ordered something with gin, bourbon, marischino liqeur, and ginger beer - it was very good.  As an appetizer we had the white fish ceviche.  We didn't like it, and even left some uneaten.  I can't put my finger on what I didn't like, but it was tart and bland at the same time.  Maybe it was just the big chunks of probably-not-fresh fish.  I like how they set up their seafood portion of the menu - 6 fish, 6 different preparations.  I can't remember the fish we ordered, but I do remember it was macadamia nut crusted.  It was almost good.  BUT, a watery relish was on top of it, so half of the fish didn't hav the crunch we like - it was just soggy.  We also ordered outside our comfort zone, and tried the black bean burger.  It was surprisingly good. Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, with sauteed onions and mushrooms on top.  Some bad, some good = 3 stars.",

Whether soup and nuts are on the menu that night or not.  From the start, Hula's seemed way up my alley - the fine marriage of sexy-class with kitschy tiki wonder.  The name says it all, and my being a girl who enjoys a little Polynesian flair, I just had to go.  The space is intriguing - like a modular spaceship tucked into the desert, decorated by a holdover from Trader Vics.  I came here to drink while waiting for friends and was bowled over by the Happy Hour prices in correlation to the quality of the drinks.  I had just read a scintillating post on ChowHound about the oft misunderstood Mai Tai - no pineapple juice or grenadine but copious amounts of rum and a bit of Orgeat (an almond liquer).  Hula's is as authentic as they come, addictively drinkable and potent while still maintaining the smoothness and characteristic flavor.  I fell in love.  Servers and bartenders are laid back and charming, and the atmosphere is bubbly without being too boisterous.  I'll definitely come back and tuck into food next time, because you all know I can't just sip and dash.",

There are your two stars.   Beyond that, I was left wanting more. The food, HH appetizers, was okay, but not transcendent. I mean, you can't really eff-up sweet potato fries (even tho I did have to add salt). But the Shrimp Spring Roll was more like, rice-tortilla stuffed with three shrimp and fried, so essentially my Spring Roll lacked any and all Spring. I don't remember what else we ordered. Maybe that was it. Obviously not worth remembering.   And then there were the BEES! They would not leave our table alone! I know, I can't exactly blame Hula's for whatever urban wildlife may interrupt my dining experience. The waiter explained that they've had three different exterminators out there to address the problem, killed literally thousands in traps, and have concluded that there must be a hive about a block away that is currently building an insect metropolis inside some unsuspecting homeowner's walls.   Really? ...No, I don't think I'll have another...and can we please be moved inside?",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place all 5 stars because I absolutely love Hula, but  I only gave it 4 because it has been inconsistent the 3 times I have been there. My faves are the poke (incredible and I don't even really eat that stuff), ceviche, and the coconut shrimp rolls. The ceviche has been inconsistent between having a ton of lime/citrus flavor to none at all. I have had the ceviche all 3 times I have been there (and will continue to do so) so I am hoping that the dish becomes more consistent. Plus, the wontons that come with it have ranged from not being greasy, to being totally greasy. (The totally greasy wontons were the same day as the completely bland ceviche so I was totally disappointed the last time I ordered this dish.) As I mentioned, hopefully it gets more consistent. The spicy seaweed salad was pretty good and so is their slaw. Things I did not like were the plantains, johnny cakes and pineapple wine. I thought the pineapple wine would be a sweet desert wine, but weirdly, it wasn't sweet but had hints of pineapple. If you like the softer, sweeter version of plantains, this is for you. I prefer the more thin, crisper plantains that aren't sweet.   It may seem like my experiences have been bad but they aren't. I don't expect to like everything on the menu but will continue to try new things and risk not liking it. But the things that I do like keep bringing me back. This isn't necessarily a place to bring kids, so my husband and I tend to order takeout. When we have eaten there, however, we really enjoyed the atmosphere. The owner is consistently there checking on various aspects and greeting the guests. Very friendly guy. This place is a great addition to the central Phoenix area.",

We sat there and started with the abalone style calamari. I was really good- long strips of calamari flash fried and sitting in an amazing sauce. For dinner I had the butterfish miso-style and it was  pretty good as well. The coleslaw and rice left much to be desired however. My honey had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was good-the sundried tomato aioli spread really made the sandwich. The fries were good, but not as good as other places and the dipping sauce was just ok.   All in all it was a solid dinner.  I want to go back and try more things. it isn't on my list of favorites but I really think Hula's has great potential. And I would definitely hit it up for happy hour.",

    "text": "I would like to give Hula the bar (and place for burgers) 5 stars, but Hula the brunch spot, 3.  I have always been served a strong snd affordable drink here, and the bloody mary was no exception, but it was a little watery and could have used a celery stalk. Though for only $5, I shouldn't complain. I got a little buzz, and that's admirable in a bloody mary.  I ordered the special omelet, which this weekend featured shrimp and a grilled mix of peppers and onions.  The good: the portions were healthy and the eggs had a good \"fried in butter\" flavor. The shrimp were perfect, not at all  dry or bland.  The hasbrowns, however, were pretty oily and otherwise unremarkable. Next time I would probably sub for Hawaiian toast and fruit.  The omelet had a sweet sauce. The server said it was mango, I believe. Regardless, it was distracting and didn't add to the eggs well at all.   Otherwise, the crowd was lively and personable, if a little over-tanned and \"out to be seen.\" just like the other places on this block, it is loud, so don't come for romance or a lounge scene. And unlike most spots that could be described as \"trendy\" the staff here is approachable and laid-back.  I was stoked for another breakfast spot in the hood, but would probably return to Maizie's next time.  Luckily, there's always after dark. The nighttime scene here is great, and I definitely think they do a better burger than their neighbor.",

    "text": "I work literally right behind this place down on Highland, so of course it's been teasing me with a packed patio at about 5 pm everyday as I head towards the train to go home. I went yesterday during happy hour for our volunteer appreciation/camp wrap-up party and it was...ok.   We started at about 4 and it wasn't too busy but but the end of happy hour the place was packed, inside and out. Being that its 50/50 inside and patio, I would definitely make it there in time to get a nice seat inside this time of year, as it would suck to sit outside right now. I totally dig all the old movies they play up on the tv bar and wall, it adds a nice sense of style to the place and the tunes weren't too bad either.   Yes, they have an extensive list of specialty drinks. Because this was the case (and our org was picking up the tab), I thought I would break out and try a new flavor of beverages. I had the Dr. Funk and I also tried the one eye'd pirate. Both were pretty good but were pretty light on the alcohol. At $5 a pop it ain't bad during happy hour, but considering the amount of liquor, it doesn't surprise me how cheap it is. The beer list is also a great selection, which is what I eventually turned to.  We also tried some of their happy hour dishes; crispy shrimp rolls, fish cakes, pork tacos, and sweet potato fries. All weren't bad but nothing really stood out to me or made me wanting to come back again. Although I have heard great things about their regular food...Perhaps I'll try that next time.  One great thing about this place is they select different valley organizations and charities to benefit one night a week, for a selected month. Portions of proceeds on Mondays in June go to Free Arts of Arizona, so please go try them for yourselves.",

    "text": "I'm going to be real here, I'm unimpressed by this place.   First of all, it is not Hawaiian. Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian/Pan Pacific/Southwestern /American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too.   Our first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot.   The initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week.   Upon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths.   As far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them.   Service is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really?   The indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now.",

We started with 2 Lilikoi margaritas which have passion fruit in them. This margarita is in my top 3 ever favorite margaritas. I give that margarita 10 limes for its balanced yumminess. My mouth waters now  just typing this. Moving on-we went for lunch, and while we didn't wait long for a table, once we were at the table, it took quite awhile to get our drinks ordered, and place our food order. That said, after that initial snafu all went well.     We started with some Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls-they were gone about as fast as they were delivered. They were so tasty with a delightful pineapple-horseradish dipping sauce. The two orders from there were The Modern Tiki Fish sandwich, and The Cajun burger. Both were so good. Both orders were so tasty and good!!!",

So when I heard this place had opened in Central Phoenix, I wanted to check it out.  Michelle A. joined me for some island fare.  The inside is super cute with some retro surf and tiki designs and our server was very sweet.  Now despite my love for Hawaiian stuff, I am not a big fan of fish (not on a plate nor in a bowl), which is a huge part of Hawaiian cuisine.  I was happy to see burgers and a pulled pork sandwich on the menu for us non-fisheaters.  I chose the pulled pork since I wanted to see if it lived up to the description of \"heaven on a bun.\"  'Twas delicious.  Michelle and I also tried out the mai tais, which were quite tasty although a bit on the pricy side.  I can't be certain if it was the drink or the medicine I was taking that shouldn't be mixed with alcohol (whoops!), but wow was I glad that she had driven.  At the end of the night we each received a little mermaid figure to take with us.  A lovely little reminder of a pretty tasty Hawaiian meal.",

It's probably one of the best in Phoenix.  They have great happy hours, especially on the weekends.  The menu has some very interesting and tasty sounding items on it.  The bad: The service is definitely only adequate.  It is easy to be forgotten about here.  Then we come to the food.  I said everything sounds great, but when it comes to taste, the flavors are just middling.  Nothing pops save for the sweet potato fries, but even those don't hold a candle to the ones at Fez or Delux.  I blame their sauces.  Given it's location, Hula's is a good place to go, but don't expect to be blown away by the food.",

Service was great on a Saturday evening, and the water was always topped off (good for the ladies in our group since we had scorpion bowls!).

When I did, it was a tiny (all-fried) late night menu--closing in 5 minutes (not 1hr 5min, like I was told).  The bartender seemed irked with the hostess for telling me wrong...whatever.  Then he chatted with a friend until we decided to go elsewhere. Not impressed.  I'll give it a third go probably. Cool bar atmosphere.",

I love that the atmosphere is so laid back, with a beautiful outdoor patio and fire pit. There's typically no wait when it's just my husband and I, even on weekend evenings. The hostess always seats us promptly. The drink menu is extensive and the menu very diverse. My favorites are the panko-crusted fish bites and their sweet potato fries...well, maybe the sauce that comes with them too.  While all my experiences have been good, I do want to focus on one extraordinary act of service I had last month. I was hosting 15 individuals for a work conference and wanted to take them to a show at Torch. I called Hula's the day before and they told me they couldn't host us all at one table as all the reservations had been booked, but they could do a few tables outside. I didn't mind, as long as we could eat there.  Unfortunately nothing ever goes as planned with that amount of people, and so we all showed up at different times, with the majority of us 10 minutes late. Not only did Hula's honor our reservation, but they had managed to put us all at one long table.  Being late, we only had about an hour to drink, order and eat before the show. The server, whose name escapes me, was blessedly patient. We ordered and were served with 20 minutes -- all 15 people. All our orders were correct and timely. I've never seen that happen with a large group ever. I was incredibly impressed and will have no qualms about bringing a large party to Hula's in the future.",

I don't like writing these because I know that bad nights happen in this business and unfortunately, people leave with bad experiences sometimes.   The reason I decided to write one is because I think how our server handled our situation was a MAJOR no no that I thought ever server knew not to do. We were on a double date and to start, we were sitting there for 15 mins before anyone greeted us, and when our server did, she didn't introduce herself or say sorry for the wait. Just asked if we wanted something besides water. The couple we were with decided to get Mac n cheese as their side, which was also a $4 up charge. Our took one into it and bit into an inch size piece of plastic!! It was clear with red cut marks (that show you where to cut) on it. We told our server, who was already extremely hard to track down, that he had found plastic and all she said had to say was \"oh, well do you want a new one?\" And he politely said no. She took it away and that was it. There was no, \"I'm so sorry\" or \"let me get a manager for you\" nothing. And when she did finally return, she simply dropped off our check and said thank you. She had only removed the $4 charge. Even though I had come here several times before and had even recommended it to multiple friends previously, it is very unlikely I will be returning.",

    "text": "Went for lunch with my husband.  I had the tofu asian vegetable salad.  It was just okay.  The salad was fairly expensive- over $11.  It was pretty small.  I was laughing about it having the word vegetable in it because it contained lettuce, carrots and tomatoes with wontons and fried tofu.  Since tomatoe is a fruit that means the vegetable salad contains exactly two vegetables.  My husband got a pork taco with rice and beans.  He very much enjoyed his.  I will not go out of my way to eat here again and I certainly would never order that salad again.",

The lobster bisque is seasoned perfectly with a hint of spice. The fish was prepared just right and the kalbi ribs were delish! The rice, macaroni salad, and slaw were perfect compliments. The Mai Tai was strong and tasty. Will be back for sure!",

It is disappointing to have bad meals there every time we try something else rather than fish tacos. The fish tacos are always good and it's our favorite dish every time we are there.  We tried the spicy Thai which is awful, a bowl of rice mixed with peanut sauce, chicken and raw cabbage. We also ordered Jawaiian jerk chicken, this is really a bad dish, it's smashed/pulled chicken with rice. The texture of the chicken is like smashed baby food with the taste of bland and grossness. I couldn't eat it so we ordered blackened mahi mahi with wasabi sauce. The fish is dry and salty.  We left feeling in such disappointement!",

The hula burger is yummy too! I was a little disappointed with the macaroni salad...Maybe because I was comparing it to the macaroni salad I had in Oahu but not a deal breaker. Also the pulled pork was delicious too!  Love the outside seating area.",

All of the drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts were creative and delicious! Specifically, the Painkiller cocktail was simply perfection; not too sweet with a cinnamon rim. The ceviche appetizer was to die for with a meaty yet tender fish in a well-balanced marinade. There was a tie between the pork plate with tender and savory pulled pork, and the wasabi ahi with large tender pieces of ahi, sweet peas cooked to perfection and mashed potatoes that didn't miss a beat. And for dessert, the coconut pie which won hands down for the entire group as the best coconut pie ever. Can't wait to return! Will check out the patio seating by the fire pit",

I went with my friends for my birthday and I was kind of nervous with there being 16 of us.  Often times, splitting checks, ordering etc can be a bear with a large party.  Not at Hula's.  Water and drinks were kept full and she was always checking on us.  I even got a bowl of the most amazing ice cream with macadamia nuts in it...with a candle! ;-)   It's not often that everyone at the table enjoys their food...but it happened last night!  I ordered the calamari sandwich which was delicious.  The calamari steak was sliced and on a sandwich topped with some really good slaw.  I asked the waitress which of the fries were better and she suggested that I just mix them which I did.  The regular fries were good, but man oh man...the sweet potato fries were fantastic!  We started with some spicy edamame...take my advice and order some of it next time! You won't be sorry!  As far as cocktails go, I am not a fan of super sweet drinks so I asked our server what she suggested.  I went with her suggestion and ordered the Blood Orange Martini and ended up have 2 of them.    All in all, Hula's made my birthday celebration very special and everyone enjoyed their time there!  We'll definitely be going back!!!",

The first few times we just went for drinks and drinks turned into lunches, happy hours and now Hula's is a go-to spot for dinner. The vibe is laid back, but cute enough for a date night, the patio is spacious and wonderful for springtime cocktails on the patio and it's been the perfect place for casual business lunches on occasion. The service is always great which is soooo key, but the food is my favorite part. I've never had a single thing I didn't love and continue to try new things. My husband love mexican/american and I'm obsessed with anything asian influenced and this menu proves to be one that gets both of our mouths watering.   Favorites:  The spicy shrimp caesar salad is unreal delicious and huge  Island Style Poke appetizer - a must try. We're obsessed. The tacos are delicious I'm in love with the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl.  You can't go wrong.",

From the burgers to the Mongolian beef bowl to their ceviche, you can't pick a bad dish.   They set out to be a throwback 50's style tiki bar and they nail it.   But, if you really want to enjoy yourself, sit at the bar. John (the tall guy) is hands down one of the best bartenders in the valley. Somewhere the art of that job got lost. The fun, easy to talk to, quick witted bartenders have been in large part replaced with a surly, too busy to chat, cooler than you crowd that makes it hard to be a repeat customer anymore. Not at Hula.   Some people think that five stars are too commonly given out. I think five stars are deserved when it's a place you've recommended *first* when somebody asks you where to go downtown. Hula's been that more than once.",

    "text": "New. Hip. Fun. The food is very good, flavorful and interesting. Cocktails match the theme nicely and are well constructed. Wine list is a bit below average, but probably a good edit for the audience. The remodel on this old eyesore of a building is nothing short of fantastic and the mid-century-inspired decor is expensive and cool. The ample outdoor seating will bring much needed buzz to the Central / midtown area. And parking should continue to be a breeze.  Now the restaurant is new, so we have to be a bit understanding while the staff gets up to speed and the logistics get worked out. For instance, with only a few wines on the wine list - the staff really should be able to recommend something. \"I've not tried any of the wines\" isn't going to help instill confidence in the menu. And we couldn't sit on the patio at 8:30pm on a Saturday (with 3 open tables) because the waiter for that section was going home. Huh? We hung around and asked a few mintues later and were seated on the patio - evidently the tables did open up after all. Not sure what that was all about...  But the menu is creative and fun. The blackened Ahi Tuna with wasabi mash and salad was most excellent - even with the silly Sara Lee-style sauce application. Ceviche was prefect. Cocktails were nice as well.   Like other Phoenix area veterans of hip and social restaurant/bars (Postino, AZ88, Kona Grill, Bomberos), Hulas, with it's wonderful mid-town location, will be a hit as much or more for their crowd as their food.",

I ordered a Mai Tai. It arrived sour and unpalatable. The waitress offered to replace it with another drink. I ordered the Tropical Itch, suggested by the bartender who said it was a sweet drink. Again, a sour drink. Perhaps a mixer/juice was bad.  We ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Abalone Style Calamari.  The calamari was good, but a bit soft from improper frying.  The coconut shrimp rolls were outstanding. We opted to skip the main course and go to dessert. We ordered the Coconut Creme Pie.  The pie was not the custard type but more of a cheesecake.  After getting a large glob of cream cheese which I had to sneak from my mouth to my napkin, we gave up and asked for our check.  The 2 stars are 1 for the shrimp rolls and 1 for our waitress.  We are leaving here disappointed and in need of a Good drink and dinner. This was a $40 lesson.",

Hula's has a great atmosphere that is both relaxing & enjoyable and it also plays consistently good music which adds to the fun.  My family & I have visited several times since our initial visit in late November.  It has become our Sunday afternoon hangout.  My teenagers really enjoy the food especially the tacos, hamburgers & chicken sandwich.  My sister craves the jungle bowl and it would be nice if it was included on the brunch menu.   There have been a few negatives:  The food is a bit pricey for what you get and we have experienced slow & somewhat sullen wait service on occasion.     Overall, Hula's Modern Tiki is an excellent choice for weekend brunch and I recommend it whenever I get the chance!",

I do like that the menu is on the smaller and uncomplicated side, the decor is fun and the big screen with classic movies A WINNER!! The fire pit is a welcoming sign of fall in Arizona, I like this place, it will get better and better I am sure of it!  I cant forget to mention the prices for the quality of the food and great service the prices are very low,try it!!",

The food is fair to good depending on the day, you can't go wrong with the Cajun burger, it's delish every time.  The main reason I go to Hula's is because I LIKE TO PARTY. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an alcoholic, but I love me some booze. Hula's is THE premier destination to go and get your drank on. Whether you have an affinity for Mai Tais, mimosas or bloody marys, they have the perfect libation to whet your whistle.   The staff there is mostly... What's the right word, amazing?!?!?!!!! They have a really great group of people there, but the last few times I have been I have been served by Tia, and she's awesome! Not only is she funny, fast and courteous, but she's a bona fide beauty to boot! If you know what's good for you, check her out!  So, when it all comes down to it, my recommendation is go for the service, stay for the drinks.  Peace and hair grease...  Monty",

On second thought, I think I figured out why Gilligan's Island was on.  After I saw the drink prices and how outrageous they are I immediate thought of Thurston Howell and the fact that the prices seemed to be cheap for him and expensive for anyone else.  The atmosphere is standard downtown yuppie with mediocre music.  The indoor/outdoor blended atmosphere is unique and useful this time of year, but I am not sure how it would fare in July.

    "text": "I think everytime I've gone to Hula's, I've always had disappointment, even though the fish is probably the freshest, and living on the islands for 5 years, it's the closest but not exact.  One sunday evening, I decided to take some co-workers out for dinner.  There were only about 4 tables with people, therefore, \"slow\" nite.  One co-worker brought her very hungry boyfriend who had been watching the football games all day.  He did ask if it was possible to turn on the game since there was nobody in the bar area watching the \"Hawaiian\" shows.  The waitress came back and told him the manager would not change it, of course he was pretty irked about it and was making a fuss about the fact nobody was watching Lilo and Stitch in the bar area, I have to agree, seriously Mr. Manager.    The manager never came to the table to explain the reason, but just stared at him who is a big man, who was in fact worried his steak was going to be spit on or something, which again I have to agree, a manager that keeps looking at you with \"stink eye\" (it's a Hawaiian Pigeon term) , you have to wonder.  It's a game, who cares about hula dancers and fire tossing on a sunday night.   Food was good, the wasbi mash potatoes were not that good this time around.  We spent over $100 easily, and never a thank you for coming to Hulas.  Again, local restaurant managers and owners, be aware, some individuals like myself try to support local businesses than chains, but with the service I've seen, may have to take you off my list of recommendations.   I did go to a sunday brunch the eggs benidict descent and the waitress was probably the best one I've been waited on..",

This would be an easy 4 star review if my server had been a little more attentive/friendly and my wine had not been hot (not room temperature, not slightly warm) we are talking about 20 minute old coffee hot. The ambiance is great we sat on the patio right off Central Ave, so their was plenty of cool scenery, and the weather was perfect. Started off with the spicy edamame and it was very tasty. Then followed up with a little chicken curry dish that was probably the best mix of curry flavor that I have ever had and the rice was perfectly done. (that being said I am a super light weight when it comes to spicy food, so this was right in my wheel house) Definitely worth a visit if you are roaming for a good place to grab a unique bite to eat. I will be back  EDIT: Based on how fast and friendly the owner was in his response to my review I bumped them to 4 stars. Thanks Dana",

Staff is friendly and quick to respond, my dishes are always cleared immediately and drinks remain full. My boyfriend and I typically have several cocktails each when we visit and they've yet to disappoint! Our favorite appetizer is, and ALWAYS will be, the fish bites. If you have never tried these I seriously urge you to, oh-my-yum! Perfectly cooked, tender fish covered in the crispiest  (not greasy) batter served alongside a creamy, spicy dipping sauce. If you're visiting for lunch or dinner the burgers are out of this world ( the black bean burger included-which Is my absolute obsession) , and all of the pork plates I've tried have been phenomenal . Very large portion sizes so my boyfriend and I always sample off each other's plates. I have visited week days as well as weekends and early enough for brunch as well as late in the evening for date night- excellent experience no matter the day/staff. During a recent staycation at a resort in Scottsdale we even opted to leave the grounds and go pick up Hulas , treated ourselves to dinner in bed as opposed to more fine dining options, and I don't regret it at all!  I've now had the opportunity to interact with the owner and his hospitality will surely keep us and friends coming back for years to come.",

I'm not a big fan of the food so it took a while for me to come back.  On a fine night when a friend was heartbroken, I figured why not give Modern Tiki a chance to mend his broken heart?  It was a perfect idea.  I called up a couple friends so we all came to Modern Tiki expecting a good time.  We were greeted by \"Thor\" (a nickname my friend gave one of the servers because of his nice looking beard), who was very friendly and provided awesome service! I started out with the hurricane, ooooooh wheeeee it was some strong stuff!  Next, I shared a Volcano (the taste was a bit tangy for me) and my friend's wife suggested I try The Itch because I get a backscratcher with it.  Hey! why not? At that time, my mind was clouded with good conversations, great friends and delicious drinks.  Towards the end of the night, I was not sure if my friend's heart felt better but I was sure the rest of us felt great!  I am a believer that Modern Tiki will solve any problems I will have in the future. Thank you for a great time!  Until we meet again =)  Few words about the food: Burgers- bomb! Tacos-good and huge Sweet potato fries- on par Spicy edamame- yummy!!! Jerk chicken- on par",

    "text": "Aloha, Welcome, Greetings, Salutations and Warm Wishes from Waikiki, Arizona!  In my search for German food to \"impress\" my play-date, I found Hula's Modern Tiki. Yeah, I know, but I already promised schnitzel wishes and caviar dreams, but time was running short to find a decent one in the area. When that fell through, I asked and she accepted food from that exotic and expensive island.  A TON of reviews praised this place and the pictures someone took were fantastic. Not to mention we were headed down the street to Amsterdam's for martinis following, so I was game. (Side note, since we were both drinking, a long walk to Charlie's substituted where I could continue being giddy and she could sober up to drive home.)  WOW, Hula's Modern Tiki was FANTASTIC! In every aspect: cleanliness, excellent staff, ambiance, location and tasty Hawaiian themed food - but who am I to judge? The last time I was in Hawaii, I ate at Ruth Chris, Dave & Busters and Planet Hollywood.   We ordered the basket of sweet potato fries, which she liked more than I did. I didn't have a problem, but they helped soak up the alcohol I had from the Painkiller I heard someone recommend on Yelp.  And that was, in fact a very good drink.  I had the Hapu blackened wasabi fish special that came with spinach, onions and so-so mashed potatoes. The fish was, as expected hot, but very good. She had, oh, who knows, I was on my third drink when I finally looked over after saying a silent prayer of thanks that I was driving.  The wonderful waitress, Ginger (who reminded me of Elizabeth Berkley - and I'm referring to the \"Showgirls\" Berkley, which is a compliment) also recommended a Mai Tai - and I must say: I DID NOT like it, so my play-date exchanged with me her Painkiller she had ordered after tasting my first one. It may be, in fact, a good drink and perhaps it didn't mesh well with the fish, but I just didn't like it. This is coming from a non-drink critic, for if I were, I doubt most my mornings wouldn't end up like woodpeckers prefer my head to the tree out back.  Apparently they have \"garage door\" walls that open to a rather large seating area outside during the two months of good weather in Phoenix, so I MUST come back when I can enjoy the outside.   The place is very nicely laid out, and is HIGHLY recommended for anyone to come and check it out. My only regret is that I only go downtown, or near it, once every couple months and me and my life-non-partner love to try new places. It would be a shame if I can't come back there soon. Oh, and to the real Hawaii, as well. Hint, hint...",

The food isn't exceptional, but it is good; beer selection could be better; and there are some great rum drinks. I thought the concept was well executed overall. We could use more places like this in the area.",

    "text": "Hula's is vibrant and lovely! It's most def a modern take on retro tiki. And they have two dollar mimosas for weekend brunch, y'all!   That's all you need to know about brunch, which is a good thing considering it's pretty bland. We tried the Island Eggs Benedict ($10, with the kielbasa) and the Hula's Hangover Hash ($9). The eggs benedict were done very well, but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else, even with the atypical meat choices.   It was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat. To top it off, the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. Suck.  Probably will not return for brunch, but mimosas and tacos may be in my future! The Tiki Time happy hour also shows promise.",

I have taken many boyfriends, friends and relatives here, and we all agree that Hula has amazing food; a chill, generous and attentive staff; and a fun, casual vibe. The restaurant is very open to the outside with some of the walls removed, and there's a fire pit to keep dinner cozy on those chilly nights. Hula's is dog friendly and right next door to Twirl, a highly reviewed froyo joint (in case you want a light dessert to follow).   I am not a fan of Bloody Mary's, and my boyfriend hates anything without meat, yet I really enjoyed their B.M., and he always ends up asking for \"a couple\" bites of my black bean burger. They got us both addicted.",

A friend invited me for her birthday celebration & I immediately RSVP'd with a yes, excited to try a new place.  Aside from our large party, the restaurant was relatively empty on a Monday night. Maholo Mondays... fantastic. They donate to a charity every Monday night & pick a new charity every month. LOVE IT!  Our server was great.  Witty, knowledgeable, and not afraid to make suggestions.  We had the Calamari appetizer and my boyfriend & I both ordered the Butterfish, but had it prepared in 2 different ways.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal.  The drinks were tasty, albeit a little pricey.  I enjoyed the slaw side, but wish that I'd had something other than plain white rice as my other side.    I do think I'll go back in the future to try more tasty treats!",

The poke is always fresh and wonderfully tasty. A little more avocado would help though. For dinner, you can't go wrong with the burgers and get the side Caesar. Mmmmm. The fish dishes are also excellent but for my dollar, the burgers win out big time here. The ambience is awesome- great art on the walls and the staff is super  friendly. Kyle rocks!!

    "text": "I don't even know where to start... but I guess I'll start by saying don't go to Hula's Modern Tiki if you're not looking to have your inner-island girl jump out of her shell and start ordering drinks with a side of Hawaiian smoked goodness. I came in to the Captains Cabin(off to the side of Hula's) on a whim and I was not disappointed. The bartender Matt, greeted me with a smile and told me to grab a spot wherever. His mustache was the kind of stache that could hush a crying baby when he walked into the room. To my amazement, the only spot that was available was on the starboard side in a cushiony booth seat. He quickly noticed and said, nay nay, get up here on the deck, matey! I pulled out my eye-patch, slapped that bad boy on and ordered the dirtiest old fashioned this side of the Mississippi. Matt nodded and within an instant, he grabbed all his Ingredients and started concocting like a wizard working on his best spell. This wasn't his first ro-de-o. He slapped that drink together, women were hollering, men were slobbering, and he poured that drink smoother than a freshly shaven prom date. I took the glass, the patrons cheered and I did a lap around the spot. These guests have never seen a drink like this before. I sat atop my perch, took a sip and  I savored the magic that Matt had made. He looked at me with a bit of inquisitiveness and asked, \"And?\" I had no words. I gave him the symbol to pour me another and right then he knew... it was a match made in heaven. Matt And his magical mustache poured me another drink and the crowd cheered me on like it my 21st birthday. The rest of the night went just like you'd think it would.. I drank, we listened to a soundtrack of the ages, and Matt made a record number of old-fashions that night. Was his secret ingredient those little cherries covered by that little orange shield? Was his secret ingredient his charm? His mustache? I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'll tell you this... go in there and ask for Matt and tell him you want to drink til you cry, you'll leave that place happier than Bob Marley when he shot the sheriff and realized he didn't shoot the deputy..",

The theme of this restaurant is as expected, a Hawaiian/tiki theme and is cohesive throughout the entire establishment. We started off with an order of pot stickers, which my boyfriend noted were not True pot stickers as they were fried. Personally, I don't mind, but if that is something you care about then make a note about it. Regardless, they were very good and we both enjoyed them. They come with two different sauces, the traditional sauce that has more of soy sauce flavor and a peanut type sauce which I didn't like too much. For our main course, we got the Hula burger and the Ahi Wasabi. The Hula Burger was very good, full of flavor, nicely cooked, and very juicy but the Ahi Wasabi was not at all what we expected. We were looking forward to a more spicy, asian like dish with wasabi and fresh flavors but what it actually was served is more of a latin type dish with tomato and cilantro(which my partner doesn't eat). Our server, Kyle, was more than polite about this and offered to to take it off our bill. Overall, I'd be willing to come back and give this place another shot. Especially because the burger was amazing and the wait staff was kind and helpful.",

I came back this past week and was pleasantly surprised, it was as though they were expecting me, its like everything was done right.  From the moment I was seated (right away) to the order and refills.  The last time I was there they must have had a bad day (or me), I had the same server and bus boy both of which were fantastic, kinda meh the last time I was here.   I'm glad to see that they are improving service.    Done with this place.  Ugh, I hate to say it but every time I come here wether its a weekend, weeknight, weekday, weekend mid-day, its always a cluster. Largely due to lack of training and communication between the staff and host.   I had a typical HULAs experience this past week. Loooooong story short, check in, tables were full so we opted to wait at the bar.  30 minutes had lapsed, I noticed tables were empty.  I waltz over to the host stand and the host was taking a phone order.  3 people stroll in, a server grabs them and seat them immediately. WTF!? If the server had waited for the host she would have known there was a list.  Anyways after she is off the phone we get seated.  Here is what really sucks, the party of 3 that sat before us (who was not waiting) and another couple who was seated AFTER us not only got water, but their menus before us. Again, WTF!?   I have to get up to ask someone to bring us water, at this point the hostess  turns bitch on me like I was asking for her firstborn. This has been my experience every time I go here.  OVER this place!   The food is good, service in terms of timeliness is the worst I have experienced in PHX.  I expect this kind of service from Denny's or IHOP, not a place thar sells $13 burgers.  Im just gonna skip Hulas until they get their act together.",

Our appetizer came out with our food. Out of 4 people only 1 received the correct  entree. Two of us got the wrong thing. One of us had to wait since the order was \"forgotten\". By the time the order came the fish was burnt. Keith did a great job trying to fix things. Now, I took half of my burnt fish home. While I was eating it I discovered a hair, not one but two. Gah!!! Not sure I'll be back. maybe they need a new chef or bring the old one back.",

But with so many choices around I was hoping for a bit more wow and better service. I came in around 4 pm on a weekday, and was awaiting more people for an early business dinner with colleagues. I wanted to sit in the back booth to avoid other diners, as it was almost empty at the time but I suspected might get busy later.  They told me to sit down anywhere but after I sat there, a server came and said I might be more comfortable in a long table right in the front if we were going to have 6 people. No big deal but the way he said it kind of rubbed me the wrong way, like not really a choice. Literally there were four other people in the entire restaurant. Anyhow I ordered a glass of wine,  and then after that was served I had to ask for assistance proactively for the next hour. They ignored me. Once the entire party arrived the service got better, but didn't wow me. So overall, food=4, service=2, and atmosphere =3.  I'll try elsewhere next time.",

The cocktails are on point, and the Mai Tai's in particular are second to none in the valley, probably the whole state--try the pain killer or the hula's Mai Tai and you'll be happy, gaaranz. The ambience is mellow, stylish, and everything you want in a Tiki bar/restaurant. The menu is awesome, features authentic Polynesian staples, with higher-end twists, but if that's not your thing there are classic options for all types of eaters (the Crunchy Spicy Chicken tacos and Hula's Baja Fish tacos, to name a few, are so good). Try this place out, you'll be stoked.",

Cocktails are amazing, as usual, as well as the food.   We started with the coconut shrimp rolls that I had not tried before. They were SO tasty!! For my entree, i'm a creature of habit and always get the same thing - the spicy thai chicken bowl. Oh my goooodness, it is so filling and to die for. The curry flavors are just amazing! It has tender chicken, spicy thai sauce (but it really isn't that spicy), avocado (my fav part), and fried sweet plantains. I also like to get a side of their sweet potato fries because the curry dipping sauce that they serve with them is just dreamy!   There is also a cute cocktail bar next door to this location! I love it! We'll definitely be back again soon!",

New place new people they are not downtown peeps ,  snobby not my old school people. They may bring in money but vibe has changed. Part of the charm was the people who no longer exist . Maybe a couple in upper management. They gave up   humility for money. The fact the originals employees left is a reflection  of what Hulas has become. Another chain resteraunt. Corrie the new manager she is younge  inexperienced  no customer service . Dont know were they found her. All I have to say is if you want old hula dont come here. It's not your cheers. Food still good drinks they do in batches now.  I guess that's progress.  I'm happy for them they have an upscale crowd its buisness. I and my friends all miss the old school vibe.",

The food makes my tongue dance, the drinks make me want to limbo, and the atmosphere is just cool enough that I could chill here all day.  Here are some of my favorites:  Drink: Mai Tai. All day everyday.  The first sip reminds me why I love ocean side drinks. They're just so fun, fruity with a nice bite to it  Appetizer: Hawaiian Ceviche. This white fish \"cooked\" (not cooked) in all that citrus and coconut milk is divine! My mouth waters thinking about how light and flaky the whole thing is.  Main: Spicy Thai Chicken bowl. The spicy thai sauce is to die for, and the addition of the plantains is magnificent.  Runner Up: Spicy Thai Fish Cakes appetizer. Kinda like a crab cake but with cilantro, chili, and ginger - it's awesome.  Pro Tip: they do Happy Hour all day on Wednesday's......you're welcome ;)",

We had the French fries for an app with the dipping sauces (which they originally forgot the dipping sauces but we asked for them an they brought them out).  The hubs had the fish sandwich, which was a great size and flavor. I had the spicy Thai chicken bowl! It was huge! Brought more than half home so I'm excited I get to have more of it later! The sauce was I credible. Im a sauce girl if you can't tell. We will be back!",

The combinations went well  and I could not stop enjoying it. A small glass of single mimosa is good for me, especially I only drink a little bit.  Wings are also good with asian inspired sauce. The fried plantains are juicy sweet delicious. We ended our meal with Hula's sundae, vanilla ice cream with macadamia nuts on top.   The restaurant has a good vibe and cool decor. Parking might be hard but if you go the right time you will get the good spot.",

    "text": "What a gorgeous building and ambiance, and thankfully they have their own parking lot! We ordered their Sweet Potato Fries, the Hapu (Hawaiian Sea Bass) Macadamia encrusted with Mango-Papaya sauce which came with rice and coleslaw, Dr. Funk (coconut rum, vodka, creme de banana and a splash of orange and pineapple juices), and the Coconut Cream Pie. And the pie is not just cream on a crust, it's layered and there's a lot of actual coconut. It was incredible!  Service was great too! We just mentioned sharing an entree when we ordered it and it came out pre-split for us, fish, rice and coleslaw! I rarely have that happen unless I specifically request dividing it. Was pleasantly surprised that they just went ahead and did it.  Everything was delicious! And reasonably priced! I was delighted even surprised by the check. Very affordable for the quality of food and location. And I love the retro theme, apparently it was inspiried by the popular tiki bars of the 50's and 60's. I especially love the classic songs they play here.  An excellent, and a very well put together place. Great for a date, or for a family dinner.",

We went during Happy Hour and the drinks seemed to be a bit watered down, still good, but definitely not strong. We tried the Mr Funk and the Tropical Itch.   For appetizers we had the Coconut Shrimp Rolls. They were a bit disappointing. Maybe a bit too sweet? The sauce really did not complement the flavor - something a bit more tart with a bite would have helped.   I had the Macadamia Encrusted Mahi with Wasbi Mashed potatoes. The food was dry dry dry. The salsa topping didn't help with how dry the fish and macadamia crust was. The Wasbi Potatoes were interesting, but very dry.   For dessert we shared the coconut cream pie - which was great! I love coconut and this pie was much more coconut than it was cream, and the crust was thick. I would order again.   I don't think I will be rushing back anytime soon, but it was a nice place to check out.",

    "text": "Yikes. This place isn't like a tiki at all. I came excited for the drinks (guilty), but left with the realization that the drinks are the only thing worth getting here. Which is pretty sad. And the drinks don't really have a tiki feel to them--they merely serve as alcoholic beverages. This all ruins the purpose of a tiki, at least for me.  For food, our table ordered a wide variety, including ceviche, the hula burger, shrimp tacos, and a salad. While I try to be nice about my reviews, this place had zero good food.   This was all made intolerable by the fact that a woman bringing out the food kept leaning over my friend to serve and hand things to one of my other friends seated right next to him. This was all very awkward to look at and we were all confused as to whether she was intentionally ruining group conversation. All she had to do was walk past that friend and hand the food to the specific person, but she kept--literally--leaning over another person. There was nothing in the way, folks, just a mere three steps would have done the job. Wack.",

First and foremost, Dana one of the owners, reached out to me and showed he clearly values their customer's experience!. He gave me an opportunity to explain why we felt the way we did, took our critique into perspective as a learning experience, without making excuses, and offered a way to make it better. It's not every day you meet an owner who takes pride in and values their customer's opinions, let alone do what it takes to have you return for a second chance. We came back tonight and without the expectation of getting special treatment had a completely different experience than before. Our server, Keith, was perfect on all levels along with having a warm smile and personality, which in my opinion shouldn't be all too difficult with serving. The drinks and food from start to finish were perfect! For an appetizer we had the Samurai Beef Sticks, with the lime-curry dipping sauce which was probably my favorite part of the whole entire meal! I even held onto it to use with the main course lol. For our meal I had the Cajun Ahi Caesar but with a lighter dressing (I cant remember the kind I had) that had a kick of spice but was was delicious and exactly what I was in the mood for! My friend had the Kalbi Ribs and it was very tasty. All in all between the service and the food everything was FANTASTIC! I am so glad we gave this place another try because if this is what the norm is I would highly recommend and do plan on coming back or visiting while I'm in CA ;)",

Being a big fan of Trader Vic's and Smuggler's Cove in San Francisco, I'm also pretty impressed.  The Polynesian style menu is creative and quite good (the pork tacos and the spicy seaweed salad are two of my favorites). The cocktails are outstanding. You'll find not only the traditional (really good Mai Tai's) but also drinks with a \"twist\" (try the Juan Ho)!   With a diverse clientele, the atmosphere is very \"hip\" and stylish (a la modern tiki). Seating includes the main dining area, the bar lounge, or outside on the large central patio. One of the best attributes of Hula's is the staff. Just about everyone working there is thoughtful, fun and attentive. Even the owner's a really a nice guy (he's often around). Did I mention they have one of best Happy Hours in Phoenix?",

And I usually choose from any of the fish. I like that you can pick what you want and how you want it cooked etc. The burgers are amazing if you don't like fish and so is the salads!!",

The ahi poke salad and the plantain bananas.  Everything else I have tried as far as the bowls go were absolutely gross in my opinion. I couldn't even stomach the ahi bowl and I LOVE ahi! So i pushed aside my bowl not wanting to tell our waiter i was absolutely disgusted with it since i think thats just rude to say that and omg my poor sister who is a vegetarian wasn't very hungry ordered a side of mac and cheese and said it was the WORST mac and cheese she has ever ate.  I would have easily said something to the waiters about her food since shes my baby sister and as skinny as they come i would tell her to stop playing with it and to let me say something but she just picked up maybe a noodle every  5 min and put it back down.  I would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no S**t's were given.  Nice to know hula Nice to know.",

We were able to sit for over 3 hours without feeling rushed at all.  Plus the prices were quite reasonable.  We started with the chicken sticks which were great.  I had the Ahi Tacos that were messy but super delicious.  My friend had the ribs and another friend had a chicken dish, both of which I would also recommend.  They have a long list of cocktails which were all delicious, but it is hard to find something without pineapple.  They have a nice outdoor patio but we couldn't enjoy that because it was one of those weird experiences of rain in the desert.  Overall I'm glad I went and I would recommend again.",

I agree with most on here that the food was ok.  I had the tofu with a lemon sauce and it was good, but not nearly as flavorful as others I have had at other restaurants.    I could see this as being a place to meet for happy hour, informal meeting or just day drinking, but I wouldn't stay for dinner.  Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food, but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful.",

    "text": "You take the good, you take the bad,  you take them both and there you have... Hula's Modern Tiki.  The rare moments I'm craving a strong, fruity, Rum fueled cocktail this is the spot to hit. The drinks are well crafted but the food and service is hit or miss. The patio is one of my favorite in the valley, but a nice patio does not make for a 4+ star experience. They're packed all the time so they must be doing something right, though it certainly isn't the Ahi Sashimi. I know, I know... don't even ask why we would attempt sashimi at Hulas. I'm embarrassed enough as it is. This 'starter' was literally two bites of food. Two bites of mediocre food for $9 mind you. I was told by my orthodontist years ago that I have a very small mouth (go ahead, there's a punch line in there somewhere) so it's not like I have some Real Housewives of The Underworld hoover mouth and no idea what a starter portion should look like. We both actually looked at each other and laughed when it was placed in front of us. I'm a tapas girl, I love small plate dining, this was just a bit extreme. The pork tacos on the other hand were excellent. Filling, well seasoned and tender; the comedy of the sashimi became a distant memory.   We will definitely return. As I stated the patio is beautiful and weather permitting, worth a trip on it's own for Happy Hour. Play it safe with you're dining decisions and you'll walk out with a buzz and a full belly.  Post script:  In response to the owner comment, I should clarify that my hesitation in ordering ahi sashimi at this establishment is not at ALL in reference to grade or quality of product but more of a 'hindsight' situation, meaning in retrospect, it's doubtful that it would be a good representation of Hula's as a whole.",

But now that the head chef has gone back to the originals back in California, the place is a train wreck.  They started off on the wrong foot by sending out the worst $12 hurricane I've ever had. For a signature drink, I expected... something. Not a glass of ice. With a little juice and the most unbalanced, disgusting mix of rum I've ever tasted.  The blackened fish sandwich they sent out had raw spots. Pink, squishy, a little cold. Whoever made it had no idea how to sear a fish.  The pulled pork was perfectly caramelized, really just amazing. But it was buried under a slaw that may have come from an inspired recipe, but was atrociously executed. It was completely inedible, and it ruined the pork as well.  The sweet potato fries were nice to munch on, but they were served with \"Hula sauce,\" which our waiter accurately compared to In-n-Out's special sauce: Ketchup and mayonnaise.   After spending $40, we sent back most of our food and left hungry.",

After reading the other reviews, I had the distinct impression that Hula was the kind of place that screws stuff up but is very nice about apologizing for it. That is exactly what happened to us.  I went to Hula after work on Friday with a couple of friends. I wasn't feeling too adventurous or particularly hungry, so I ordered the green salad. What I got was a soaked bowl of lettuce mix peppered with chinese buffet-style wontons. Yuck. My friend pointed out that he has an egg allergy, but the server brought out a dish with cole slaw, then took it back after he pointed out that cole slaw contains egg. The server then brought out the same dish without cole slaw, but with aioli. After pointing out that aioli contains eggs as well, the server finally brought out the dish without eggs. She was very apologetic, but it just validated the experiences of everyone else on Yelp....they work hard to correct things, but they should just get it right in the first place.  I do give them full props for the remodel of the space though, the building is beautiful.",

My girlfriends and I all ordered the butterfish, based off the recommendation from our friendly waitress.  It was delicious!  Try the LemonGrass or Macadamia Nut Crusted preparation.  Both are yummy!  We all licked our plates clean and couldn't stop raving about how fresh the fish was.  It practically melted in your mouth.    Minus one star because it was freezing inside!  Bring a sweater!  A response from the owner:  \"Velika,  Great to see you! I appreciate your taking the time to give us a review, and for your business! We embrace all criticism, both good and bad, since it helps us in our constant struggle to be better. I'm glad you came back! Sorry about the temperature, but here's the problem we have: if we turn off the A/C when it's humid, the moisture in the air settles on the cold concrete floor and makes it slick as ice. I'm afraid someone will fall and really hurt themselves, so that's our dilemma. I'm so sorry that it marred your experience, and hope to make it up to you sometime soon.  Take care, Velika!

We were there again this past Saturday and I tried their Johnny Cakes for the very first time, which is a Jamaican corn bread and it's the best corn bread I have ever eaten.  I am suppose to be on a diet, but when someone mentions Hula's I make sure to make exceptions for this place, even if it's the only meal I eat all day.  Also, all the waiters, waitresses, and I think the owner Dana are always so friendly and welcoming that it makes you just want to stay there longer than intended.",

The food simply is not good. I hope the owner reads these reviews and adjusts accordingly.  I will continue to come back as this is a local neighborhood restaurant for me. However, I'm going to lower its rating from 4 to 3 stars.  Note: This restaurant  definitely is worth a try. It's got a good vibe, and service is excellent. However, for 20-30 bucks, I expect better tasting food. I am convinced the management still is ironing out the kinks.",

    "text": "Well we were standing outside the doors 10mins before they first opened...that's how excited we were for this place. After watching for months, we finally have a new restaurant in town with a little more attitude than Parlor or StFrancis. Hula's is aiming at the kick back & relax crowd which fits me specifically. Good food is only good if I can pair it with a great drink & Hula's doesn't disappoint. Really, this place is great. To begin, the renovation is wonderful. On par with the other CenPho restoration projects of the past year - this one stands out by creating a period piece instead of going for a more modern style. There's a fire pit & plenty of outdoor seating along with a wonderfully decorated interior - all separated by some moving glass garage doors (like Postino). The best piece is their sliding table bench. It's hard to describe but a wonderful feat of engineering. The appetizers were pretty great. The sweet potato fries will give Delux a run for their money & are savory & crispy. The cevice is served with some oversized wonton chips that have a great flavor. The cevice itself has a bit of spice to it thanks to the peppers. The main dishes are a bit limited right now but the coconut chicken is simply delicious. With a sweet & spicy sauce over a perfectly cooked coconut-crusted chicken, this dish comes with rice & black beans. Really one of the better dishes I've had...plus, there was a lot of it. I had originally ordered the pork but had to steal the chicken from my wife. It was just too good. For dessert we just had to try the key lime pie. Not only was it NOT some frozen green brick (like most places) but it was a whole mess of complex flavors that made it the best key lime pie I've ever had. The servers were friendly & attentive. The owner came by & was receptive to input. The chefs were quick & the bar tender was heavy handed with a bomb Trader Vic MaiTai. Everything was great. Add to all of this the fact that it is on the LRT & I can't help but think I'll be spending a lot of time here.",

    "text": "With the unfortunate number of terrible experiences I've been having that have led to recent 1 and 2 star reviews, I'm glad Hula's provided a decent experience.  I've been here twice and had a crappy experience (the 4th day they were open, so I was willing to forgive) and a pretty good experience a week and a half later.  I've had just about everything they offer, so to sum up:  - Cool atmosphere, as noted by everyone else.  Open late, serves food late, and is relatively cheap  - There is nothing authentically Hawaiian about anything they serve here.  It's as authentic Hawaiian as Fez is authentic Middle Eastern.  That's not a bad thing, lord knows I love Fez and have enjoyed Hula's, it's just a fact you need to know in order to have a proper expectation of the food.  You're not going to get a fine Hawaiian culinary experience here.  I like Roy's for that ;-)  - The food in general is good-not-great.      - Favorite dishes - shrimp roll and poke apps, macadamia crusted mahi and teriyaki ono (or is it teriyaki hapu?).      - Decent dishes - The ceviche is ok, it's a fish ceviche which I'm normally not crazy about.  The pulled pork dishes are underwhelming but ok.  The sweet potato fries were mushy on the first visit (bleck) but nice and crispy the second, so it's going in the \"decent\" category    - Least favorite dishes - the steak was a 9oz piece of gristle, bleck!  The fried plantains were also pretty gross, I was really hoping for plantain chips but these were just mushy burnt blobs of plantain.  - The specialty drinks are all VERY SWEET...but VERY STRONG.  I forget the names of the ones I preferred.  We also had a volcano bowl which is, as previously noted, very sweet and strong.  The best drink they offer isn't even on the menu though - they stock Absolut Boston which is a black tea infused vodka.  My friends and I always order it with lemonade and have a delicious, strong Arnold Palmer.  - The service is hit and miss.  The food generally comes out of the kitchen very quickly.  But some of the servers are flakes.  Feh, not a big deal.  All in all, I'm glad to have this new edition to the CenPho light rail area.  Adds another good option to my regular haunts of Fez, Maizies, Postino, and Cheuvront.",

    "text": "We went last Friday for the first time since last fall and holy crap, when did it become such a cool place to be?! We used to get a table on the awesome patio but this time had to squeeze into a tiny table inside. Oh well. Good for them!  Parking is a bitch so I found the gravel lot and hoofed it. It's ok--you don't have to wear hooker heels here to fit in.  Happy hour is a decent deal--$2 off drinks. But when the full price is just $7-9 for a mixed drink, don't feel bad if you miss the 6pm cut off! My fave is the ahi tuna burger. It's not ground up--it's a giant hunk 'o fish, cooked perfectly. I paired it with the sweet potato fries. If they're from a frozen bag, I'd be shocked. Or maybe I don't care; they at least look homemade! My girlfriend got the tacos and raved--two (plus the rice, etc.) made for a filling dinner. Portions are perfect.  Drinks are clever and super strong, so, please, get a cab. Love the mixed crowd here--everyone is welcome!",

    "text": "Well Dang I guess I wont be first to review haha.....  Apparently Hula's reputation precedes it.  The fun vintage atmosphere combined with an excellent wait staff, good mix of cocktails, and a great fairly diverse menu makes this place a 5 star in my books.....  Fun Vintage converted Garage (I think?) a nice older notstalgia with a modern twist the name says it all.....  I ordered a Griled Mahi Sandwich, Court ordered a Cheeseburger (we are creatures of habit)......let me tell you it may have been one of the best meals I have ever had.....literally.  The drinks were very well mixed (yes it was the middle of the day but were no drunks...) Just strong enough but you could taste the layers....and they knew how to make a fogcutter which is a staple of 1950's Tiki bars.  Sweet potato fries with Wasabi Ranch Dipping sauce gets extra point for being unique (as if 5 stars wasn't enough).  I do think the food has quite a sophisticated taste for being pretty much Burgers and Fries....it was a great lunch although I have heard this place gets elbow to elbow at night and on weekends.......best to hit it up when its not so bust IMHO.  Great Value, Great Food, Great Service = Zero Complaints....",

When my cousin, who used to be a bartender at the Santa Cruz local, told me they were opening a place in Phoenix, I was SO HAPPY!!!  My favorite things are the Poke appetizer (seriously the BEST EVER), sweet potato friends, fish cakes, and DR FUNK! I could drink Dr. Funks all day long - nothing but coconut pineapple cocktail goodness! I could swim in that stuff it tastes so good. In fact, that's what I want for my birthday - a kiddie pool filled with Dr. Funk!  On the Santa Cruz menu, they have beef satay and ahi rice bowls that are amazing - I wish they were on this menu as well.  The ambiance is more \"posh\" than the Santa Cruz restaurant. I love the outdoor patio -it may be one of the prettiest I've seen in town.   I will go back to this place every time I miss home.",

Usually sit on the outside patio, which faces Central. Haven't really tried much of the food, calamari was pretty good and been told that their burgers are delish. The best part of Hula's is their Tiki Time happy hour, weekdays 330-6 and all day on the weekends! I'm not usually a Mai tai fan, but theirs are reeeally good.  They have brunch specials on the weekends, haven't tried that out yet but need to soon...  I'm always on the prowl for a mimosa!! Overall, I really dig this place. Chill and a great happy hour!",

The good part of that is we had some good laughs at some RIDICULOUS conversations that were happening around us. I won't be visiting this place at night ever again. I may hit up Hula for some mimosas though. This place is much better for a nice brunch than it is for a night out.",

I had the Hula's Hurricane and my husband the Mai tai. And both were really good.  For dinner I had the luau pork platter, my husband had jerk chicken, my younger son had the teriyaki chicken sandwich, and my older son, a very picky eater, actually ate and enjoyed the Mac and cheese,  oh, and our starter was the coconut shrimp rolls.  We had a young man named William as our server, and he did a great job.  We were still in time for happy hour, which was great.  Liked the casual vib and decor.  They had heaters out in the Plato, but we chose to sit inside.    We will definitely return for another meal the next time we are in town.  There is nothing like this in Albuquerque!",

Go for the regular fries, not the pretentious sweet potato fries.  They may be good, but the original ones are better.  Besides, everyone does the sweet potato fries nowadays! The truly unique joints do the regular cut traditional french fry well.  Yum!  Our friends got some other entrees which looked just as fantastic.  Moderately priced with good scenery.  Not to mention great service (table of 6, waitress memorized our order without error), and we kept adding more people on and she couldn't have been happier.  Splitting checks was not painful at all.  Go here and get the fish sandwich, it is something to marvel.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite place!  I have been 4 times now, and just simply love it. I mean I went on a Saturday and always myself there the very next day, its just addicting. Three out of the 4 times I've been I've sat at the bar, and the bartender, is great.  He's always got suggestions, tells what he likes, his fav's what he's had and hasn't had and why.  He's even got suggestions on the very cool all day (10:30-7pm) happy hour drinks on the Saturday/Sunday menu.  What a deal!!  The food I've had is outstanding.  One thing I'll never forget is the butterfish, that was melt in your mouth delicious!  The wasabi mashed potatoes was not what I thought they would be so at first I was disappointed.  I expected them to be spicy and creamy, but then I sat and thought about it again, and said wait, these are exactly what they should be, Mashed potatoes infused with wasabi, kind of like cucumber water.  I believe I just had the wrong idea to begin with.  The seaweed salad is a great starter, a huge portion and tastes like seaweed salad.  This was my pre-Brunch visit.  So this past weekend I tried the Brunch.  Saturday's visit was later in the day and I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I went with the Fish taco.  Another fish done well, perfectly done and seasoned.  Much to my surprise they give a little bit of what appears to be homemade salsa, that goes with it and is yummy, i found myself trying to figure out exactly what was in it so I could go home and duplicate.  My boyfriend had the pork taco's, and I really enjoyed the pork flavor.  I was expecting greenchilli ish type flavor, but it was very sweet barbequey.  The black beans and rice aren't anything special, but not gross either.  Then Sunday I tried the Ahi Eggs benedict.  I was so scared, as I said I'm not a huge breakfast fan.  It was awesome.  Very very good flavor.  It got cold real fast, but that's my experience with eggs..  Recommended Drinks: I think I've tried at least 2 other drinks from their menu, but I can't remember what they were called...but these are the ones that are normally at my table: Hurricane, Tiki Bastard if you like Gin, Blood Orange Martini, Mai Tai, and you must at least once try the Bloody Mary.  I believe they make their own mix, it's got a bunch of horseradish bits in it, and is very different.  Its definitely missing the worchestire, but was actually not bad with out it.  I agree it isn't for everyone, but I had two.",

The last time I was there I had Duke's Lua plate, with slow pulled pork, cole slaw (which had a subtle wasabi flavor) and sticky rice which was amazing.  The fish is of high quality as well, though the blackened Ahi Tuna burger was a bit dry .  The burgers are excellent, with the Hula Burger being exceptional.

We finally stopped in on their 3rd Anniversary and boy, are we glad we did. The wait for a table was probably 45 minutes, but the place was packed and in all consideration, it wasn't as long as other places we've been. Plus, we wanted to sit outside, since a band was going to be playing. (Who were awesome, btw.) Drinks were $3 all night, special anniversary prices, and we tried the Dr. Funk and the Painkiller. The Dr. Funk was delicious! The Painkiller is similar, but had cinnamon or another spice in it that I didn't care for.  I ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls to get us started and they were fantastic! For dinner, I had the coconut encrusted butterfish and the husband had a pork plate. (Mine was delicious but the pork was just okay.) Our friends had steak tacos and a salad. The steak tacos looked so good, we had to come back a second time. The second time here, I had the steak tacos and the husband had the steak dinner. Mmmm, the steak tacos were totally worth it. (We also ordered the coconut shrimp rolls again - definitely a favorite.) For dessert, we got the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream. The brownie wasn't anything special but the ice cream was good.

The macadamias were burned. The fish was suuuper fishy tasting. The coleslaw is perfect in texture and consistency, but literally tastes like nothing. And my rice, albeit good plain rice was actually the highlight of my meal. The mango salsa was mushy and not vibrant like it needed to be. The service was good. No empty cups waiting refills. Just nothing to get excited about and while I love the concept both mine and my husbands dishes were lacking. Fortunately, we have a dog so my 20 dollar fish wasn't wasted.",

    "text": "This place has a nice ambience. I went on a Friday evening, so it was pretty packed. There's an option to dine inside or outside. Since it's around 100 degrees right now, they have an outdoor misting system. Diners can also sit inside at the bar.   For appetizers, we ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls. It comes in 4 rolls for the price of $7, which is pricey for something that tastes just like eggrolls. My boyfriend had the Jerk Chicken Plate. Be prepared for a fairly generous portion of chicken. The jerk sauce was good, but became overwhelming. It was easier to finish the chicken by intermittently eating other items on the plate. My favorite was the fried sweet plantains. I ordered the Blackened Wasabi Fish Special. The fish did not taste fresh to me - it was just a satisfactory dish. Based on what I ordered, it was a little pricey for mediocre food.",

    "text": "Trendy restaurant with Polynesian themed drinks and food. I tried a few bites of various dishes and had the hapu with lemongrass sauce. The hapu itself was tender, flaky, and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately the breading on it was charred in some areas, causing it to taste bitter. The breading was also very hard texture-wise, making it difficult to eat without giving your jaw a workout. The actual lemongrass sauce was broken when it arrived, creating an unappetizing mixture of runny liquid and coagulated yellow mass. The taste of the sauce, while initially pleasing on the first bite, became harder to eat after successive bites due to the sour flavor of it. The sides for the dish included some slightly undercooked rice and very generic, bland coleslaw.  I also tried some mahi-mahi, which also came with the same rock hard breading, and a similarly sour sauce. The actual fish was delicious though and we peeled apart the breading and pushed aside the sauce to savor the pure taste of the fish.  I also tried some ceviche, which had way too much lime juice in it, overpowering the whole dish.   The one True highlight of the meal was trying some of the jerk chicken. It was tender, with bold, spicy flavors.   Service was good for a busy Saturday night. Drinks were refilled as needed.  Overall, the fish dishes need more simplicity in their preparation for the True taste of the fresh, good quality fish gets muddled when it is breaded and doused in a powerfully flavored sauce. While the atmosphere is great, if you dine here just be careful of what to get since the dishes tend to be hit and miss.",

We waited for a long time for our check that my partner told me he'll be in the car so she can get a hint.  Nothing happened.  I went to the restroom to give her a hint nothing happened and my credit was still there.  So I went to the hostess and asked if there's a manager so I can pay.  The hostess took my card to process me all the while the manager heard me complain right behind me and just ignored me and took off the other direction.  That was really unprofessional.   I work in a fine dining restaurant and never saw that level of unprofessionalism before.  I won't be coming back.  My partner is a police capt and will be spreading this experience as I will in the restaurant industry.",

So to find a place like this nearby was pretty exciting. It's not like our Chicago place, but I love that Hula's has food.  We tend to come on Friday afternoons for happy hour, really can't beat the prices for tiki drinks, apps and a chill atmosphere. The employees are always nice and I've never had a bad time.  My favorite drinks are the Painkiller and the Dr Funk. I usually get one of each and leave happy and ready to start my weekend.",

From the arms of the owner which was 3ft up  into a napkin on the floor.  It was disgusting.  I spoke to the manager Ronnie and he said the restaurant is dog friendly, which I don't mind but it is a human restaurant where people are eating.

    "text": "This is an update to my rating a couple or so years ago.   Since that review, they have moved to a new location and probably changed managers.  I've been to their new locations a few times for happy hour, and always enjoy their cute drinks and appetizers.  We sat at the bar.   I had the blood orange martini, which I've had a few times in the past.  My friend saw someone across the bar having a drink in a martini glass, and went over to taste it.   She liked it and decided to order it herself.  Since I tend to like drinks that are not too sweet, she said she'd have me try hers, and if I liked it, I could order it for myself.   It is a new drink they are trying out, not quite on the menu.   I think it was called a saturn or something like that.  David was our initial bartender.  He made my blood orange martini a tad bit tooooo tart.   I asked for something to lessen the tartness, and the other bartender -- sorry.  I didn't get her name -- went ahead and made a new one.   Much, much better!!  I tried my friend's drink, and we both agreed it was delicious!   In fact, we proceeded to have a few before the night was out.   That drink is very good; no taste of alcohol at all, which could be dangerous.  We ordered from the happy hour menu the coconut shrimp rolls, fried calamari, spicy edamame, the pork tacos.   My favorite was the shrimp rolls.   YUMMM!  The calamari was kind of weird in appearance and shape.   I have to remember not to order that again.   The tacos weren't bad.   I just ate the topping and skipped the corn tortilla.   The edamame was good as well, but I was soooo full!!  Every single person working behind the bar is professional, friendly, and helpful.  I will need to get the name of the other bartender as well as the man who bears a striking resemblance to Pharrell.   He probably gets that a lot.   Till next time.   I'll be back for sure.",

They have a tropical cocktail menu with choices that you would want to find at a modern tiki bar. Our server was pretty efficient and we ordered quickly.  I went with the Baja fish tacos and my girlfriend ordered the chicken sticks and a side of Mac n cheese. The tacos were pretty awesome and came with a side of rice and beans. Good sized portions and tasty flavor. The chicken sticks were pretty good and the Mac n cheese was okay. There are many other options on the menu that I would like to return and try.   The bathrooms were clean and cute, matching the vibe.   Overall it was a fun atmosphere, good food and promising drinks. We enjoyed our meal and I would return!",

    "text": "After rekindling my patronage of Hula's, I've fully bought into the hype! This restaurant is stylish, modern, and most importantly as laid back as the big island. Sit at the bar. Or the patio. Or the cozy little room in the back. It's all adorned with a modest Tiki decor that sets the mood but isn't overbearing or tacky.   After your first visit, you'll dream of rushing in with your colleagues after a busy day at work. Hula's Happy Hour, which famously runs all night long on Wednesdays, features small bites and fun rum-based cocktails. The Hawaiian Ceviche is a welcome twist on a Mexican fave. With its marinated, raw fish served over a generous plate of wonton chips, you'll order one to share, and another to keep to yourself! If you're a vegetarian, get the tofu tacos! But even at your hungriest, you may want to save room for the wings, grilled chicken skewers (and delectable Thai peanut sauce!), or the cocktails you won't be able to get enough of.   At just six or seven bucks a pop during HH, their cocktails are simple but refreshing classics. The Painkiller is a must-have. The One-Eyed Pyrat, featuring rum and ginger beer, comes in a comical ceramic pirate cup. It is incredibly on brand, always. Don't be afraid to venture to other parts of the menu, however, as there's lots of other fun to be had! If you don't have anywhere to be, and you're not driving, split a Scorpion Bowl with your friend. It's a formidably-sized punch bowl with a flaming shot of 151 in the middle. You're going to feel this one, and you're going to have fun.   If you want something heavier, the entrees are fantastic. There is a plethora of seafood for the picking, but what I can't stray away from lately is the pulled pork sandwich. It is seriously my favorite pulled pork I have had anywhere, ever. It's got a soy glaze, and is a little sweet, but packed with flavor nonetheless. Whatever you order, just know it's going to stay True to the Polynesian motif--expect fruity flavors and lots of spices.   Overall, Hula's is your daytime chill spot. It's your date night. It's your business lunch, and your Saturday night out. Take a bit, take a sip, and you just might forget you're in the middle of the desert.",

My friend and I ordered a cocktail and we each got a bowl (if you're hungry, get it, if you want something light reconsider, it was a lovely and generous portion of amazingness!).  The decor literally takes you to a far off island, and you feel like you're on vacation. The cocktails were beautifully crafted and the food fresh (wasabi mashed potatoes anyone!?)",

    "text": "To be honest, I didn't care for the prior iteration of this restaurant/bar. But this new location and reboot has changed my opinion. Hula's Modern Tiki is no longer a pick up joint (that smells like last nights sour alcohol and vomit - as the Central Avenue location had distinguished itself).  This new establishment is for adults who like decent food in a lively atmosphere.  Again, I didn't care for the menu at the old Hula's, but this menu is much improved, has a wide variety And is interesting and eclectic. Check it out for yourself. On the menu you'll find: tropical and Caribbean bowls, Mexican tacos, and good old American dinner plates.  They're so cool here even let our family bring in a big cake for someone's birthday And they were kind enough to provide plates and silverware.  The decor is a little bit Polynesian and a lot more modern throwback to mid century but more modern than anything.  We were honored to sit underneath the velvet painting of Elvis, which was not lost on us.  We'd come back here but, perhaps not frequently but we'd come back.",

For the apps we got the wings which were alright and the shrimp rolls which were amazing. I ordered to kalbi which came with rice and Mac salad. Everything was delicious and the portion was large! Besides the great food the decor was very cozy and chic. The bathrooms were clean. We will definitely be back.",

Shoot, I've been to a number of restaurants in Hawaii that can't match Hula's teriyaki chicken sammich! The sweet potato fries too.. mmm. If you're a Phoenix native, a college student, or just passing thru, this shop is a must-eat!",

I last wound up here with Laura L.; Liz S.; Tom S.; J.D.L. and Kelly R. after doing Happy Hour at Fez and we had a great time drinking and having some food. We had two of the whopping huge drinks that come with four straws and flaming rum in the middle. My favorite drinks are the Dr. Funk and the Blood Orange Martini but they have some great beers and lots of other yummy cocktails on the menu.  I also LOVE the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...DELISH!!!!! Great Happy Hour specials and an awesome patio....once summer is over!",

The fish is always fresh and cooked to perfection in my experience.  Great ambiance too.  Whether it is after work, date night or with kids, Hula's is always a fantastic choice!",

My main complaint boils down to lackluster service. We were looking for a semi-quick bite and to get on with our Sunday. We noticed the menu said that they had happy hour on Sunday so we ordered some adult beverages and appetizers. I then ordered a their Luau Pork Sandwich and my wife ordered the Pork Tacos from the happy hour menu (so we thought).   When the bill came it was quite large. Turns out only drinks were on happy hour. I am sure there was something that noted that fact but it obviously was not obvious since we both did not know this. In my opinion the server should have done a better job explaining the menu and happy hour deals instead of walking up and saying, \"Can I get you something to drink?\" I'm not looking for a line-by-line explanation of the menu but perhaps a quick overview of what is going on inside the 4-walls; especially when we order some things that any other day would be on happy hour. The server really just didn't seem to want to be there.  Nothing was horrendous about Hula's I just left feeling a bit bamboozled. Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "I'm unimpressed, and not pleased.  The main job of a good bar is to make your day better, especially if it hasn't been a good one.  FAIL Hula's, FAIL.  A girlfriend and I went to Hula on Sunday after a ball game around 4pm.  We bustled up to the bar, hungry and thirsty, and ready to get some tipsy on.  I'd never been to Hula's but my friend had been here several times and said the staff was fun and the food was great.    We were happy to see that happy hour was ON (and hence the 2nd star) but I was a little disappointed that food was not included in HH on Sunday.  Frankly, I found the dinner menu prices to be pretty high for sandwiches & burgers.  This wasn't some high class joint, and there were 9 gross flies buzzing around the bar and landing on the glassware.  My friend was looking on her phone and told me there was a Yelp special for Hula's, so I should check in via text for $5 off my bill.  Yay!  So with that I felt better about the prices.    Well, when the bartender came to take our order, we tried to make a little conversation but he was very curt, cut us off, and asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously?  Your bar isn't full, try to be friendly!  Anyway, my friend showed her phone and got a COUPON for $5 off her next visit.  WTF - that's not what the deal said.  Then, when I mentioned to the bartender that I was having trouble checking in with my blackberry to get the $5 off deal, he just shrugged.  I tried to show him that the page was just spinning and trying to refresh, but he gave me an obvious, \"I could care less\" look and turned away.  Oh no you didn't!  Look, the Pink Bikini Martini I had wasn't even good (way too much sour, not enough alcohol to be called a martini), so I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with a pissy bartender on top of it.  I can drink at home, I can eat a burger at home, so if you're not going to provide nice service, there's really no need for me to be here. BUH-BYE!    My friend told the bartender to cancel her food order because we wanted to go somewhere else.  That got his attention and he snapped at us, \"so what's the problem here LADIES\", but why answer?   We left and went elsewhere for great service, food, and drinks.",

The Jamaican Jerk Chicken Plate was uh-mazing! When it arrived and I saw the portion of chicken, I almost asked if they had made a mistake. It was a HUGE pile of jerk chicken! The dish also came with Johnny Cakes. Corn cakes with spices and fruit? Yes, please! Fried plantains are also one of my favorites and theirs were perfect! The right amount of crispy on the edges and sweet and and and foodgasm!  This place is always busy when I drive by. Know what that says? Just another great spot to eat in CenPho!  Thanks, Dana!",

Then I thought I was ordering odd items off the menu, but I've tried a variety of items from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclusion. Finally, I decided Hula's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail. It's just meh on the food side.   Hula's definitely has one cool patio, amazing architectural features and mighty friendly staff. I just can negate the eating experiences to provide a better rating.

    "text": "The place itself is nicely laid out and open and airy and there was a large TV at the bar where we watched the hockey game. My issue is that this is another place that does not know what happy hour means. Either have a damn good happy Hour or just don't have one at all. They have like 20 appetizers you can order, but only five of them are \"On special\" during Happy hour and each one is 5 bucks, which is about a $2 discount from the regular menu. It is the same story on the drink specials, mostly $2 off, but at least those can be had on almost every drink. The standard for my happy hour is 1/2 half all drinks and appetizers - don't pick and choose what you want us to eat. Beyond that, the food is overpriced for this part of town as well, averaging $15 bucks for bowls and some sandwiches. The Mai tai I ordered was not Tikki style at all, in fact there was no freakin pineapple either and it was served in a cocktail glass. I guess it is their twist, but that is just twisted. The Hurricane was much better and that had some rum floating and the missing pineapple was located in this drink. If they could do better on the HH food, then its worth a return.  UPDATE: was contacted by Dana the owner, who says \"Some items I simply can't afford to run at 1/2 price (or even a big discount) due to the ever rising rent and cost of commodities\"  Well, the recession runs both ways. You have to give a little to get a little these days. Further examining the menu, this gentleman is very tricky as lunch and dinner prices are exactly the same. At lunch, if you want fries or a side it's $2 extra for your $10 burger, but at dinner it's $12 and the side is included. Very tricky.",

Food specials are only Monday-Friday. Every time I've been for a week night happy hour I make sure to get the mac and cheese. It's only $5 if I remember correctly. VERY rich, flavorful and comes out in a piping hot crock. I can usually only eat about 1/2 of it so it's also a decent sized serving!  I love drinks made with ginger beer (i.e. Moscow Mule) and they use Cock N Bull which is one of my favorite ginger brews.   I'll be back again and again and again. :)",

    "text": "I'm not sure I would have given this place a chance if it wasn't for the gift certificate I won earlier this year, but it was time and I was hungry.   First out was drinks, and yes they all are fruity. I am sure you can order a standard non-fruity drink, but their signature drinks follows the theme and are blended in exotic juices. Fruity but good.   The menu is comprehensive and has something for everyone, thats a huge plus for me.. but since I was here to try it out I went with a signature dish called something like Jawaiian Pork Jerk Plate, or something to that effect and it was in-wait for it-credible. Incredible!!  Way more food than I expected, and the meal included a generous serving of pulled pork in a jerky sauce with some kind of chutney on a bed of rice with fried plantains. And if this wasn't enough, they have their own version of some kind of freakishly delicious plantain bread that also accompanies the meal. And it all was amazing. I kid you not.   So good meal and fruity drinks, what else? The service was great. From everyone, not only our gem of a waitress (that was super nice and professional). The whole staff is friendly. Something I don't see all too often.   So what's the negative? Well, since I have to be harsh.. the interior isn't very cozy. It's clean and good enough, but it just doesn't have a date-feel to it. Nor do they make their dessert pies on site (I'm guessing here, but it is hard to find a negative for this place. Seriously. Have I mentioned the stellar service? Yeah, I think I did.)  When food, drinks and service converge in this way - it warms my heart and I support this local establishment to my fullest. Considering eating here - do it. I know that I will be a repeat offender, and by offender I mean customer.",

It is located right across the street from St. Francis Chruch so it is easy to find.  Good Ice Tea & lots of lemon for starters. Drinks are pretty reasonable for sure. I ordered a Burger. It was OK ,good but the bun was just so so. Lighty toasted, nice cheese,3 choices on the cheese. It came with regular fries. WHen they came out they were all over cooked and had no flavor at all. I think the Oil was old. However, our server was nice enough to switch them out and give me Sweet potato fries instead. Which were entirerly different and so much better.  The girls each got Ahi Eggs Bennie. Of course I had a taste or 2 and they were really good. Love the way it is decorated in here. Very Mad Man,50's 60's. A very clean place and the Rest Rooms are as well. Cannot believe this is my first time here. I liked it and will be back.",

    "text": "Other than the fact that you can dive into the joint from the sidewalk, I am not sure how you can consider this Tiki Bar a dive. Lets put our grass-skirt on and do a review on Hulas:  ~Fud/Drink~ Off the top, I have to say that Hulas is EXACTLY how I imagined it went I was day-dreaming about cocktails in the middle of my 4x10 shift. The cocktails they offer are simply bliss. Have a couple of them and your rum-soaked mind will transport you to a beach filled with......er....more booze? Wherever Jimmy Buffet goes to after he get schnockered, just imagine that...Wherever it be, we are talking about a tropical paradise.    I tried a Zombie, which is a concoction of numerous tropical fruit juices along with rum...You just have to try it, its the house specialty. I was the DD, so I could only try this one drink before sobering up... next time, I will break necks to be able to have a couple. I did indulge in the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...which were equally amazing. I can't describe in words how filling this appetizer was. Needless to say, I was in heaven chowing down on the fish cakes, along with my Zombie...a sentence never spoken until now, btw.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ I went on Halloween night this year. I was expecting ghouls and spookiness. I got a tiki band with a bass playing upbeat beach songs, all dressed as zombies. It was 100 times more fun than spooky music, and set the scene. All waiters were dressed in fun costumes, and proved to be helpful when I asked questions. When we sat down, a waiter came up and helped us order while I waited for a friend to show. I do have to say that he was a tad bit awkward, kinda hovered a tad every now and then, but I'll give him a pass...at least he cared and kept coming back, rather than never again. While relaxing and eating/drinking, I checked out the space, I love how wide open they made the venue, with easy entry to the outside. As to where you can sit, you have a large wrap around bar top to sit at, as well as outside seating, perfect for cooler temps. As you can tell, the place is all set up as a tiki feel, you almost would come to expect a sand-volleyball court would be set up nearby. Fun times, nonetheless.  ~Extras/Rating~ I have nothing but good things to say about this location. They offer a ton of fish items, so next time I am over, I think I will splurge and give some things a try. Add them on Facebook ASAP, because they offer numerous deals each week. Check out their website which also has info on their daily specials. Combining the specials with normal prices, you can really have an awesome time at a lower price, which is why I really love this place. I can't wait to go back, it only took one night, one dish, and one drink to hook me on...so I am sure they'll get you hooked too! Stop on in! 5 stars goes to Hulas for location/atmosphere, cocktail varieties, food selection, daily specials, and strong management/customer service. You can tell they are doing it right. Thank you Hulas!",

I really like the rice and beans, but I didn't think the tacos were that spicy. To be fair, I do have a high threshold for spiciness, so my criticism isn't the most fair. Still, the tacos were good.  My husband got the burger. He didn't really care for it, but I don't think Hula's is the kind of place you go to for a burger. If you go and you're thinking about getting a burger, just don't. Try something else, like some tacos or the ribs. I will say that the accompanying Caesar salad was fantastic. I did not expect such a good salad but it was really excellent.  Mai tais are delish, but super strong! If you're going to have more than one, make sure you have someone to drive you home (who hasn't been sipping on mai tais with you).  Overall, very nice. I'd like to stop by again.",

Hula's have always been consistant with both food and Staff.  In the two years that I have been a regular, I see the same friendly staff each time.  John, one of the bartenders, is a big reason why we visit Hula's so often as he is friendly and makes us feel like we are his most important customers.    The food is always fresh and for me, addictive.  My favorite is the Tuna Poke that consists of raw ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, onions, macadamia nuts.    Hula's has a great TIKI TIME happy hour will save you some money on food and drinks but beware, they do get crowded.  TIKI TIME Happy Hour 3:30p-6p, Mon-Fri & All night on Wednesdays!",

But, I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of \"big deal happy hour bargains\" and the food wasn't anything I craved. Until now.   They must be new, because they are not included on the menu posted on the website, but there are some rice bowl additions. I had the steak bowl. I'm telling you: the steak was pink and tender, the sauce was spicy and craveable, it was a generous portion size and, over all, that bowl alone will get me to be the first to say, \"Hey! Let's go to Hula's!!\"",

We love the area and all the surrounding places, so, why not? Best decision. We started off with appetizers (beef sticks, edamame, wings) that were anything but traditional. Every dish had a cultural kick to it, which I loved.   Not surprisingly, we could still go for round two... so, all these plates start coming with jerk chicken, ribs, something called a Kahuna? (steak plate) and all other kinds of jaw-dropping, mouth-watering foods.   So, at this point, I'm completely stuffed and can't breathe. I love food, but Hula's won this round. However! I kept drinking (damn those sour amarettos) and my girlfriends were drunkenly flirting with the bartender... aaaand that's when you know it's time to go.  As the saying goes:  everything deserves a second chance. See you soon, Hula's!",

Back to the Margarita.... I ordered the Lilikoi Margarita, yum! Was so good! I'm not big on the sweet drink thing so this was my choice. My friend ordered the \"Dr. Funk\" which was very good too but too sweet for me perfect for her.  For food, we had the pork pot stickers which were delicious. The sauces were both really good. Also had the Surfrider Chicken sticks which were nice and juicy and delicious as well.  We shared our entree and went with the Jerk Pork. Too spicy for my friend but was perfect for me. The plantain was perfectly sweet but I was kind of sad there was only 2 pieces which left me with only one piece since we split the dish. Plantains are cheap enough so not sure why they didn't give more. Plantains help break up the spicy jerk flavor, if they put more on the plate it would be perfect!   Finished off the meal with some macadamia nut ice cream. Very good! We chose not to go with the brownie and they had no problem with that.  Very friendly staff and they had no problem making things the way you want it.  All in all it's a great little place to sit around, drink your drinks and munch on some food.",

The cocktails are fairly good especially if you are into rum, the atmosphere is vibrant, and the service is generally spot-on.  This is one of those places where the first thing I had off the menu rocked and that is all I ever order....so, I highly recommend the ceviche-yummy marinated white fish on crispy wanton chips!  When ever I am out-and-about in central Phoenix, this is always a spot I consider hitting up along the route.",

I am nostalgic, as a kid in the 70's vacations consisted of places that always had a Tiki bar  My summer home in upstate New York was in walking distance to the Tiki resort.  And then there is Hawaii of course ...ah the memories .  I have a serious thing for Tiki bars, every home i ever lived in i built a Tiki bar ( except my new one ) Gimme time !  Whoda thunk that in the valley of the sun i would find one ( big excitement here)  Aloha Au Ia`oe...( i love you ) let me count the ways ....  1.seriously loved the bar - totally unique, and a beach bunny like myself felt right at home.  Fond memories of all my hot surfer boyfriends came to mind   2.nice patio, nice fire pit ..i dug it !  3.happy hour -WOW i am so Dr.funked up off 3 of those tasty bad boys .  4.nice happy hour menu & the coconut shrimp rolls hit the spot .  5.friendly, funny patrons ...i was told i looked like the little mermaid \"in a GOOD way \" ha ha ha  ( note to self : never add a gloss to my hair myself again )   so to recap,  even if i wasn't totally  dr. FUNKED UP , i would still love this place! nice chill spot, good service .i had a great time ..... i am a total fan !  update: Place still rocks after a year of patronage.

Hostess and servers were really friendly (it helps I met a regular here). I liked the ambiance inside. The drinks were great and so was the appetizers. Sweet potato fries and shrimp rolls, bomb.   Then I had the chicken wings, they had this different taste to the sauce, not in a bad way. Hard to explain it. But I'd definitely recommend them.   What really had me, sucked me in and will have me back. They have a projector that was playing movies onto a wall. The original Batman series, like from the 70's. Yeah, the nerd boy in me had a big O. Then after, they played the old school stop motion Christmas story movie.   What what!!!  Oh and I just happened to find out a girl I went to high school with is a part time bartender here. Her name is Selena. She's very sweet, ask for her, great personality.   I'm holding off on the '5th star because drinks are sorta pricy, but hey that's why Seamus isn't that far. :-P",

Happy Hour is only a rumor in Chicago so we were excited to happen upon Hula's HH during this time. Some apps and specialty drinks are priced at $5 and they both get the job done.  Not mind-blowing awesome, but pretty good.  With the $5 off when you check-in on yelp, we ended up with a bill of $10.  Nice and easy.  It's unusual for us midwesterners to dine outside on Christmas Eve, but the welcoming outdoor patio with a huge firepit in the middle helped me forget about a White Christmas. I'll take al fresco dining, please.  Service was attentive and friendly to us out-of-towners.  Whenever I'm in town, which will be more often now as my family has moved here, I'll make sure to try to include a visit here to my itinerary.",

Although there were several open tables, we had to wait about 30 minutes for no other reason than they were trying to space out the seating so the servers weren't overwhelmed and you didn't have to wait at your table long.  Huh?  I actually saw the hostess seat a party of two at a four-top next to an empty table for two.  So it's better to have me wait in the entry way (along with scores of other people) and become increasingly irritated, with no drink in hand needless to say.  Finally a group left the bar and we were able to sneak in there.    Enter the bartender with a halo over his head.  My Hula's Hurricane was delivered swiftly and all was right again.  We opted to share appetizers, poke and coconut shrimp rolls.  Now the poke did not sound appealing to me at all because of the whole raw fish deal, but my friend gave it high marks, and rightfully so.  With the soy and sesame dressing and the avocado, this dish was fantastic.  The coconut shrimp rolls were not to be outdone, though.  Perfect with a pineapple dipping sauce.  Would love to go to Hula's again, but will have a flask with me...and a lawn chair.",

Only complaint I have is all they serve in beer is Hawaiian.  I am an amber beer lover so I don't usually have a drink while here.  Don't they have amber beer in Hawaii?  I also wish they served dinner rolls with the dinners.  Someone at our table had cerviche which was served with large crispy won tons which I stole and used these with my pork to make up for the dinner rolls.",

Paired with their rice & beans (and maybe even a cocktail), makes a perfect meal.  I brought my grandma and mom here a few weeks ago and they tried the fish specials: the pan-fried soy-misu hapu with mushrooms and the macadamia encrusted mahi with mango chutney (you can also do these specials with tofu!). $14-16 for rather brilliant fish specials is a steal! They were both overjoyed to try something new and don't think they'll be requesting Olive Garden (or the dreaded Cheesecake Factory) for their upcoming birthdays. ;)   Our server even recommended the perfect cocktail for my grandma and took it a little easy on the tequila, per her request. The service here is consistent and now that I started eating fish again, I can reintroduce myself to all that their menu has to offer. Forever a Hula's fan.",

I went with my husband and a couple of friends and we all ordered something different. I was nursing a cold and asked for hot tea and I got to choose my tea and the server said \"I hope you don't mind, but I brought you some honey.\" Score one! I thought that was a considerate touch.   Ok, the food... my meal was delish, I had the salmon with jerk sauce. All of the different flavors definitely kept me focused on eating and that was a welcome change. My husband had the rib eye, and He shared a piece and I felt his food was too cool. It should have been hot, especially since it was a meat dish. Our friends both had chicken dishes and one of them had the teriyaki chicken and it was a huge serving.  We'd like to go again, the decor and the vibe made it feel fun and different for a night out. Next time, we'll try a couple of drinks...  So, if you're looking for a change of pace, downtown, where the food is elevated from what you usually have...go here. Parking is tough and it was packed but I think worth it! Fun!",

One of the staff took my pick-up order wrong but Hula resolve this very quickly and professionally. If I was angry or annoyed, the sincere and quick resolution diffused it effectively. In my experience with service industry, good customer service is not easy to come by. People get defensive or whatever else and make things worse. This is an example of excellent customer service.",

The absolute best thing about their happy hour is Wednesdays happy hour is ALL NIGHT LONG!   I hosted a happy hour for my Meetup group last week. We were originally supposed to be a party of 24, only 16 showed up. Our reservation time was 5:30pm. The staff was kind enough to let us hold the other table until almost 7:00!! We had such a good time! Some of our happy hour favorites were:  The sweet potato fries basket (or you could get them mixed with regular potato fries) I had a mix in a small size.  The wings  Calamari  Coconut shrimp rolls  The fish nuggets (I think that's what they were called) My goodness they were delicious!!  The Mai Tai (3 was my limit). They were strong and SO tasty!!  There's a drink with a cute little back scratcher in it. I forgot the name but there was a hit with a lot of folks on my party.   Give Hula's a try for happy hour. You won't be disappointed. Next month we're gonna give them a try for brunch",

It's all night happy hour on Wednesdays so right in the beginning they were already impressing me. Their cocktails are 6 bucks on happy hour and these weren't your typical sweet tropical drinks with barely any booze in them. They were pretty big drinks and very delicious too. The food on happy hour was mostly great. Chicken wings were great. Crispy, and I loved the sweet soy glaze that they were tossed in. Sweet potato fries were crunchy and cooked well. Basically what you would want from a sweet potato fry. Just make sure to only get a small order if you don't want an entire huge basket full with the large. Fish bites were surprisingly great. It is just straight up fish battered in panko and fried to a golden brown. All thriller, no filler (shout out to Guy Fieri). The only thing that I was not a fan of was their calamari. This is a very unique take on a calamari and I don't think it worked that great. The textures were kinda off but other then that that meal and the drinks were on point. Last thing I will end on, this restaurant is freakin loud!! Don't come here expecting a quiet evening. If you go on happy hour, just expect some great drinks and bites.",

Calamari to start, then Loco Moco and the Jawaiian Pork Plate, and Coconut Cream Pie to end with. Wow, just wow! I've never had anything with this kind of seasoning before, I've never had plantains before, and I've never had coconut cream pie before, but they all blew me away! It's funny, but my pork plate came with pulled jerk pork, rice, Jamaican johnny cakes, and fried plantains, and I think the cakes and plantains outshone the pork! Not that the pork wasn't good, but I fell in love with those cakes! Service was nice, the location is nice and open and clean. Very interesting to look at. As it got darker I wished we were one of the lucky ones who got seated by the fire pit, because it looked really cozy. The only complaint I've got is the calamari app; it's good don't get me wrong, but for $8 we only got five little strips of fried calamari. Every other portion we got was perfect for both taste and price, it was just the calamari we had a problem with. The flavor was good though! Thanks for a great evening!",

    "text": "Given this is Hula's 913th Yelp review, it seems that there is not much left to be said about the restaurant.   Nonetheless, here are some notes on my recent experience there with my girlfriend and mom!   To bring, I think that the architecture is one of Hula's best aspects. It is a modern Hawaiian open concept building. It is decorated nicely and uniquely with various lights and woods that give the customer a full sensory experience.   Moving on, I went here during happy hour so my party just stuck with the half-priced appetizers! We order a ceviche, Hawaiian styled chicken wings, sweet potato fries and a crusted shrimp roll plate. I mainly ate the chicken wings and was quite pleased with them. The sauce offered an original flavor to a classic fish. Also, the ceviche was excellent! We scooped it with warm corn chips and were refreshed by is cool nature and flavorful/well-seasoned fish. I did not have any of the shrimp, but the sweet potato fries were good! They were your typical fries but what made the fries was the Hawaiian ranch that was served with them.   Lastly, the service was great, and it was nice to see that most of the staff seemed to be native Hawaiians who had a passion for their culture and food! My waiters name is passing me, but he was a kind young man who was attentive and polite throughout the night.    If you have yet to check out Hula's and are in search for some great Hawaiian fare, make sure you try it out!",

    "text": "You can never go wrong at Hula's.  I absolutely love the concept, especially being in love with Maui this restaurant takes me back to those vacations!  I highly recommend getting the Cajun Ahi Caesar.  The right amount of spice with hefty chunks of ahi tuna.  It was so amazing my mouth is watering right now!  Served on a bed of white rice and Caesar salad!    The cocktails here are so delicious.  Do not be fooled by the modest description of any of their specialty drinks, all of them are worth every penny.  The drink we ordered this night was the Scorpion or \"Volcano Bowl\", and it is nothing to play with.  First off, it comes to you set on fire and if you dare to drink what is ignited, your throat might just lock up because its a shot of 151.  The stories I have had with 151 is for another day but just know that the scorpion is for two people.  If you're caught drinking this alone, you will more than likely be looked at as an alcoholic!    All in all I love Hula's, it's my second time at this location and I look forward to visiting their Scottsdale location.  Definitely come with friends/family, large groups are welcome!",

    "text": "I'll get the drama out of the way now and say, unequivocally, I love, love, love this restaurant.  My wife and I are vegetarian, and it's not only veg-friendly, it's excellent.  Their veggie burger is one of the best I've had in the city, and Dr. Funk may be my favorite drink of all time, with the Scorpion Bowl coming in a close second.  Spicy tofu tacos?  Excellent.  My favorite dish is, by far, the Jungle Tofu bowl, which should always leave me with a to-go box, but is always consumed fully on the premises.  I almost never get dessert anywhere, but their key lime pie is the best I've had since Key West...no kidding.  Parking can be a bit of a bear on the wrong night here, but my favorite time to visit is on a Saturday afternoon when it's almost always quiet and relaxing.  We have an electric car, and their two charging stations are a plus, but at night they are almost always occupied by gas burners.    And before I forget, the staff here has always been lovely, from the hosts, to the bar and wait staff.    As a last word, Hula is my go-to place when I need to relax and forget about my troubles.  They really make me feel like I'm on a tropical island.",

    "text": "I stopped by Hula's last week for a quick dinner/drinks with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised. Of course it was a bit warm at 5:30 to sit on the cute patio so we opted to sit inside. We did get there during happy hour so we ordered off that menu so we could try different items.   For starters we each had a cocktail:  She had the Pink Bikini Martini, it was good but tasted like a jolly rancher for sure.  I had the Dr. Funk, I really enjoyed this refreshing cocktail and brought me back to being on a beach! Ahh...   For food we started with the Hawaiian Ceviche, very fresh white fish in citrus juice, coconut milk, chili, cilantro and garlic. The ceviche was refreshing and light. The chucks of fish were very good size and also you had a nice portion for two people to share.   For dinner she had two of the pork taco's and she really enjoyed them. Both tacos were loaded with a ton of shredded pork and salsa on the side. They looked very yummy.   For dinner I had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes. The Shrimp Rolls were very tasty. They had two rolls cut in half and were cooked and flavored perfectly. The Spicy Fish Cakes weren't my favorite. You got 3 cakes on an order and as they were spicy I felt they were missing something. Not sure if I'd get them again but well worth the try.   All of our items were $3 to $5 so the happy hour prices are well worth going and to try a few things.   I will for sure go again as some of their fish on their regular menu looked very tasty so I'd like to try other items and take advantage of their cute patio.",

    "text": "Now the reason why Hulas doesnt have a higher rating is beyond me. This place is amazing and seriously they have a hard clientele to deal with. The food is amazing and you get to dine in a upscale hipster spot for a decent price.  The fish is always fresh and I recommend the butterfish with the coconut crust its sweet and buttery and amazing. I'm also a huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes. I have never had a problem with the freshness or qualitly with my burgers or steak either and they have ALWAYS been cooked to my liking as I find that alot of resturants in Phoenix will scorch the heck out of a piece of beef and then you get this black piece of grizzle and Hulas doesn't do that.  Ahh..the drinks..strong delicious cheap big. If you go with friends get the scorpion bowl its a huge bowl of liquory goodness that comes flaming with these huge straws to drink out of. The pink bikkini Martini tastes like a watermelon Jolly rancher too and its awesome.   The waitstaff is amazing too ask for Tia and you won't be disspointed. She IS the best server and guarenteed to please, and Selena and Ron at the bar will keep you entertained and happy for hours.   Ok now seriously 2 stars for syrup???? Are you kidding me??? Comparing crab to syrup? I have had the syrup and its awesome its REAL maple syrup and its maple and buttery so settle down and relax. If you THAT fanatic and hung up about syrup and its flavor why dont you go to IHOP on a Sunday morning and get yourself some Boisenberry and leave the good people at Hulas alone.",

I really knew nothing about it, but it sounded kind of fun and quirky - which is exactly what one wants for a memorable time.  Not at all disappointed.  Everyone loved their meal.  The atmosphere was great, the patio was amazing (we didn't get to sit there, but the \"walls\" were open so it was pretty nice!).  Overall, we had a great time.  I have been back probably about 5-6 times in the past year.  I would go more often if it were a little closer to home (not their fault).  Each time I have been satisfied with my meal, drink, and service.  I also love the \"neighborhood\" feel of this place.  I have always had very friendly servers and have had conversation several times with tables near me.  It's just a good vibe.  Favorite dishes: Ahi Poke Habanero Tacos Pulled Pork anything  I also love their fish menu.  You can pick from 4-5 different types of fish, then pick the style of cooking/flavor and it comes with side dishes that compliment your choice nicely.  Have never been disappointed ordering a fish dish.  Anyway - try it!  It's fun!  And it's locally owned - not some big impersonal chain.",

If I am ever in the area, I'll stop by this place again.    The ambiance reminded me of Hotel Valley Ho in Scottsdale, so I did like the retro-modern decor.  Not so much the tiki stuff, but everything else.  Very chic and swanky looking.  The menu is reasonably priced, especially for lunch.  My friend and I were hungry for brunch typed food, so that's what we ordered.  Rice was awful, but I definitely enjoyed the \"loco-moco\" style dish of rice, black beans and eggs over easy.  But the best thing I remember from that meal:  well done Portuguese sausage!  I might just order only that next time.",

Our server was friendly and helpful, when it came to my quandary over which new tiki drink to try(I settled on a Mai Tai, followed--after the food--by the Hawai'i 5-0. The Mai Tai was delightfully tart, while the 5-0 was fruity and refreshing.). We also got a chance to chat with the owner of Hula's, Dana, who was friendly and personable(also, seemingly the only business owner who actually reads Yelp reviews).  As for food, we shared the whitefish ceviche(a lovely bite from the citrus juices, with a melt-in-your-mouth aspect added by the coconut juice, all accented by the brightness of fresh chopped onions, chili, and cilantro). We also ordered the spicy edamame again--what can I say? I'm addicted! Jamie loved his Cajun burger and totally cleared his plate of fries(\"they were sooo perfectly crispy\"), while I ordered a (giant, $1) bowl of rice.  So, once again, Hula's has left us happy and wanting more!",

I think that I've sampled them all at this point, and haven't been disappointed. For the most part, they are exactly the kind of drink you would expect to find in a tiki cup or dodge little paper umbrellas or fruit skewers to get to - all fruity and full of tropical booze. Ahh, I can practically smell the salty ocean breeze and feel warm sand between my toes. In my opinion, the best of the best are the Blood Orange Martini, the Mai Tai, and Dr. Funk. So what if Hula's wait staff hasn't quite gotten the hang of prompt service as long as I've got my Mai Tai and sweet potato fries.   When I finally made it beyond the happy hour, I found that Hula's is more than just great drinks.  Let me tell you, when they say that their pulled pork sandwich is \"heaven on a bun\", you'd better believe it. I don't know whose idea it was to throw some coleslaw on that heavenly bun, but that person deserves a medal. The combo of that tender, warm barbeque pork with some cool, crisp coleslaw is just magnificent. Word has is that their burgers are also pretty tasty, but I haven't been able to get away from the pulled pork, and apparently the burgers are too yummy for my friends to offer me a bite (not that I've ever shared my sandwich).",

I went here on a Thursday night for drinks and dinner before seeing a show in central Phoenix. I just love that there's a completely open air patio, a covered bar/dining area and an additional little section that's also open air but more fitted for intimate dining rather than groups. Lights strung, great music, good wait staff, this palce just was a really lax, tropical, island vibe to it without being over the top Hawaiian- which can be tacky. It pulls more from the vintage 1950 beach bunny scene and it works, really well.  I ordered the calamari sandwhich with sweet potato fries- per Foursqaure suggestion. Um, HELLO beautiful. It was so amazing. the salw and just enough crunch to the breaded and fried calamari strips with an ah maze ing ailoia sauce that even went well with the fries. But my favorite part of this heavenly plate with the flakiness of the roll. It was a Kraiser roll but cracked just enough to amazing. Every weekend they have a fantastic happy hour special. Check that out and also like them on Facebook, trust me, you'll want to. Can't wait to go back and try all the yummy drinks!",

I think the fries were my favorite, then the coleslaw, and the pork last. It was all tasty though. Since it was a friend's birthday, they brought their signature sundae which was heavenly. Vanilla ice cream with macadamia nuts mixed in, topped with toasted coconut and other stuff. Overall, pretty stoked with my food choices. Server was awesome until we asked to split the check.

    "text": "Hula's is amazing! I recently moved to the Biltmore area at the end of November and saw Hula's as I was driving down Central one day and decided to give it a try. I quickly became obsessed and for good reason!  I've been here over 10+ times the last few months with girlfriends for Happy Hour or with my boyfriend on a weekend evening and I have always had outstanding service, amazing food and awesome drinks that knock my socks off. Not to mention the prices are totally reasonable!  The Ahi Caesar Salad and Sweet Potato fries are my favorite go-to's. And the Blood Orange Martini is soooo good. My boyfriend swears by the the Teriyaki Ribeye.  I have to give the owner a shoutout for taking good care of my boyfriend & I about a month ago on a Friday evening. (This rave review is long overdue!)   My guy is in the Marine Corps and is stationed in Cali so we only get to see each other on the weekends when one of us makes the 6 hour drive to each other. He arrived around dinnertime on a Friday night and we headed to Hula's for his first visit. We were both starving and ordered quickly after sitting down. The food was delayed quite a bit for whatever reason and our server kept coming over to apologize. We assured her that we didn't mind at all... we only get to spend about 48 hours with each other so we were just enjoying each others' company, so no big deal! We never even questioned what the hold up was even though we had noticed that it was taking awhile. We finally got our food & our server told us that dessert was on the house for our patience. We thanked her & told her it wasn't necessary. Again, no big deal, we hadn't voiced a single complaint! My boyfriend did decide to take advantage of the offer though since again, we came in starving and we enjoyed a delicious dessert. He also asked the server if Hula's sold their awesome teriyaki glaze for purchase. To our surprise, our server went back to the kitchen & came out with a coffee cup wrapped in tin foil filled with the glaze for us to take home! Talk about going the extra mile regarding service! My boyfriend was tickled. At the end of our meal, even MORE to our surprise, our server dropped off a check with a balance of $0.00. She told us that the owner really appreciated our patience & understanding and that our meal was on the house. We were blown away!  To the owner of Hula's... THANK YOU. I have told this story to so many people and spread the word around about Hula's to anyone who hasn't tried your restaurant yet. My boyfriend is now rightfully obsessed with eating at Hula's whenever he comes to town on the weekends & I try to frequent the restaurant at least once every couple of weeks with girlfriends on the weekdays.",

The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is that the service wasn't that great. Our party was ignored multiple times and they wouldn't let us sit at our table until half of us arrived, so we just ended up crowding the front bar. Our waitress left in the middle of dinner and didn't tell us, and the bartender treated us like we were inconveniencing him. It was pretty busy, but still it's no reason to be rude.  Overall the place was good, and I'd like to go back (maybe for brunch), but I hope the service improves!",

    "text": "I went to Hula's Modern Tiki with my partner.  We were surprised with the renovations and the cool additions to this unique old building.  We decided to sit outside on the patio next to the fire pit.  The weather was beautiful.  It was a perfect night.  The garage door walls were open so the entire restaurant was exposed.  It made for a great setting.  I ordered a Blood Orange Martini to start the evening.  It was juicy goodness and I couldn't taste the alcohol which means it is probably lethal.   We ordered a couple of appetizers, the Seaweed Salad which was tasty and the Poke which was great.  It was great because the order comes with a ton of sashimi.  The avocados and the other fixings were blended perfectly.  I fogot I was eating raw fish.  Order the Poke.  For our main dishes, my partner ordered Pan Fried Hapu.  He ate the fish then nudged the salad and the rice and bean around his plate.  He wasn't happy.  I ordered the Shrimp Tacos with rice and black beans and a side of Plantains.  The tacos were good, very nice.  The rice and beans were bland.  Which is okay for me when it comes to rice and beans.  The Plantains were awesome.  Delicious.  For dessert I ordered the Banana coconut creme pie.  In a word, \"Heaven\"  Hula's creates a nice atmosphere.  I am giving it three stars because I wasn't blown away.  I will be back and may update my review.  I would like to give it four stars one day.",

We were greeted immediately and the host was funny and attentive. He told us the wait was 15-20 minutes. We went to the bar and 10 minutes later he personally found us and seated us.   I had a pink bikini martini.. perfect.. just perfect.  We shared an app of calamari.. AMAZING. My friends ordered two different versions of the Mahi and both raved about it. I ordered the jerk chicken and it was delicious.   Love the decor, the open sided buildings, the patio, the firepit.   I actually texted my husband while I was there to tell him how cool the place is and that we have to go back together.   With three entrees, an appetizer and five girly drinks we got out of there for under $100 with a generous tip.. which reminds me, the service was great.",

The servers are over-the-top friendly and excited which makes me happy to be there :) I'm not a big drinker but the Dr. Funk is probably one of my favorite cocktails I've ever had.   My biggest problem with Hula's is just that the food isn't that great. I have tried quite a few menu items over various trips and I am just not knocked out by any means.   I think the best way to do Hula's is happy hour. $5 cocktails, $5 apps (I actually like their appetizers more than many of the entrees!)  Happy, indeed!",

They have a large patio with fire pits and space heaters for the cooler months that are perfect for your hip crew.   Admittedly I have only been here for drinks (not that this is a problem) and do not feel comfortable giving more stars until I eat here as well.    Anyway they have drinks named the Scorpion and Volcano that come with multiple straws for your group to enjoy, but if you are going to partake in these be sure you have a way home! :) Just ask my friend Mark.   To all of you out there from Tucson or UofA this is the new and improved Kon Tiki for you to enjoy as you pretend to be grown up for everyone else this is a fun change of scene.",

They have the best poke in town and we shared one of their fish (fishes?) too with the lemongrass coating and it was equally delicious. Their patio is beautiful and contemporary but still casual at the same time. Definitely hit their happy hour because that's the happiest time of day anyway and you mind as well spend it here enjoying delicious eats and tasty libations.  (By the way, why is someone complaining that this is not authentic Hawaiian food when at the same time they ordered a New York Steak sandwich?  Does someone have their crabby pants on or is a geography lesson in order?)",

    "text": "I give this place 3 stars b/c I think there's room for improvement, and there's no doubt that the owner, Dana who came by our table and earnestly asked for unabashed feedback will take our gentle critiques to heart. Our waitress was also very kind and attentive.  We ordered the ahi tuna wonton appetizer.  It was difficult to eat, and sort of flavorless.  I hate adding salt to things, but everyone at the table agreed that a little bit of salt really brought out the flavors.    The ginger brew soda, should probably be called the honey brew soda with a twist of ginger made with Winnie the Pooh in mind. I didn't try the cocktails, but another friend who was dining at a nearby table said that the cocktails were the only thing she liked about the menu.  She ordered the pork, and from what I hear that's not hitting any home runs.  I ordered the halibut, that was accompanied with a scoop of hearty, plump rice and a slaw salad that added the perfect texture and flavor to the entree.  I really enjoyed my dish.  I'm no foodie, I just like a yummy meal, so it satisfied my simple requirements.  With that said, it could have been on the lighter side.  The Halibut has a cream based sauce, and the slaw was quite creamy as well.  If they subtract a little cream out of one of those items, I think that would strike a better balance.  The sliced steak with wasabi mashed potatoes came in 2nd place.  The texture of the meat was perfect, and the presentation was very nice.  However the flavor of the steak did not wow me.  With that said, the wasabi mashed potatoes were pretty kick-ass.  The chicken something or other with plantains and the same rice that came with the fish, was really meh.  It was overly sweetened, and the meat was dry.    I should mention that they have tofu tacos for the veggies of the world.  The building has great bones... they don't make em' like that anymore.  There are interior design choices that aren't my fav (generic upholstery, too much tiki kitsch memorabilia), but all and all they've done a great job.  The patio definitely needs some trees in some large planters, or some way to creatively incorporate more greenery (see Parlor).  It has too much of a concrete jungle feel to it out there... not very welcoming.  The bathrooms sort of felt like the old Bahama Breeze place, but I'm probably being too harsh.   I think this place is gonna get better and better, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DECIDE TO ADD A CHOCOLATE DESSERT.",

Even if you dont like a lot of fruity drinks they have a full bar. Appetizers were okay but not particularly noteworthy. But the main dish of Jerk pork tasted great but made me sick later on that night. Almost as bad was the waiter who was polite but aloof which kind of Debbie Downer'd the experience. First and probably last visit. Too bad.  Anyone want my 5$ coupon for free food?",

I took my mom for brunch when she was in town.  Very friendly staff and I love the retro look of the place.  The best part....they have Sweet Potato Fries!!!    I decided on The Big Breakfast Sandwich.  Big is an understatement!  This sandwich is huge!  A big helping of scrambled eggs, some bacon and tomato, what else could you ask for.  An awesome breakfast sandwich that went great with my mimosa!  My mom went with the Polynesian Chicken Sandwich which was also fabulous.  Just the right about of teriyaki and pineapple piled on grilled chicken.  The pesto sauce was a great touch.  My roommate who is in love with sweet potato fries order a basket along with Island Eggs Benedict.

    "text": "Last night... I decided to try out Hula's after reading the many reviews about the modern tiki. i do love the location and the building it is situated in, it's airy, bright, and inviting. Loved the fire pit on the patio, and I was tempted to request a table by the fire pit but my dinner mate wasn't feeling it, since it was quite chilly last night, and the fire was making her eyes watery. So, we chose an inside table. As service goes, our server was prompt, and helpful with making suggestions on what was best.   We started with a basket of sweet potato fries... and I have to admit it's one of the better places on central with sweet potato fries, loved the aioli dip and I am quite a fan of the some what soggy fry and mixed in with some crispy ones, it was YUM and worth getting as to quell our appetite while waiting for our entrees.   My friend M is a vegetarian so she opted for Black Bean burger, she's had the Black Bean burger at FEZ which is delish so she wanted to compare altho the idea of spicy tofu tacos was tempting. As for me, I opted for the lemongrass encrusted Mahi which was a recommended by our server and asked for a side of plantains to complete my meal. The table next door was served their food and it looked yummy, so M and I were looking forward to the items we ordered.   There are restaurants out there that have visually appealing entrees but lack with the taste factor, and there are places out there that are visually, and satisfyingly appealing and makes you have daydreams after the culinary experience that you yearn for it days after. In the case of Hula's it was visually appealing but not so much a wow in the taste department. Now, it's not like it was bad but it wasn't like OMG \"this is bomb, mmmmmmmmmm, OMG... yum... I'm so getting this again... Oh when are we coming back?!?\"  either. It was ok. I was full.   The Black Bean burger was simply described by my friend as greasy. Mind you it was her fault she failed to ask them to take off the onions but she was shocked with how much sauteed onions was slathered on the burger coupled with the melted jack, it just didn't mesh well the black bean patty in her opinion. It has lackluster appeal that when she had the uneaten half boxed up she simply forgot it because it didn't register on the yummy scale :-(   As for my lemongrass encrusted mahi. It was good, the slaw just didn't mesh well with grilled fish. Maybe some grilled veg would have best suffice over slaw. And the plantains were not the best plantains at all, seemed kind of dry and not as ripe, was hoping it would more soft and have a little crisp to it.   Our dinner was ok, and did come out to 3 stars, I'm not completely writing off Hula's Modern Tiki since it deserves a second try at least. But I'm not wowed by it that I am hoping I'd get back there sooner... I can wait for later when that urge arises. There's simply too many better options than Hula's like Maizie's next door or FEZ up the street. So if you haven't tried it, you oughta but nothing to write home about.",

The ceviche was also tasty as was the seaweed salad.  I also tried the ahi sashimi which was just OK.  Our group sat at the community table and hung out for quite a while trying all the fabulous drinks offered for the \"tikki time\" specials.  The Pink Bikini was the best one in my opinion.  The service was awesome, but then again they weren't all that busy.  I was actually really surprised at how slow it was; from the other reviews I thought it would be a Saturday night hot spot... but I guess it is more of an after work Happy Hour type place.  The patio outside looked very comfy and although I liked the look of the modern decor inside, the seating was not that same relaxed resort vibe.  They need to get some couches or lounge chairs in the bar area instead of just the plastic bar stools.  I did really enjoy the music selection but at times it was a little hard to hear the conversation.  I will definitely be back to try out the patio experience when the weather cools down.",

The sides that came with the entree included the wasabi mash which was best dish overall that I had all night. The Pulled Pork was flavorful but not memorable.  I know you are reading this and wondering...so what's so bad about this place that lead to the 3 star review??  It was just okay...besides the atmospere, the food menu was too casual.  It just does not fit what I was experiencing visually.  There was nothing horrible about the food, but there was nothing worth coming back for.

We did not eat, so I can't comment on the food, but the island drinks were definitely good.

Service was great - multiple waitresses coming by to ask if we're doing ok, need a refill, etc. Only negative, which I expect/hope will change, was that it was not at all packed at 11 on a Saturday night.  Uptown doesn't need dinner places, it needs bars! Side note:  if it was packed, I think parking would be a little tight (but then again, it's right next to the light rail, so you could just train there!)",

    "text": "The central Phoenix corridor has seen an explosion of new restaurants over the past year. Hula's is one of the most recent additions having opened last month. In terms of location and venue, nothing could be better. Located right on Central Ave near a light rail stop in a newly renovated building, Hula's has excellent street appeal. Not to mention a great indoor/outdoor dining area and patio that is perfect for the October to April Phoenix weather. However, I feel that if Hula's does not work hard to rectify some less than favorable first impressions, Hula's may not make it until May.  Let me be clear that I have only dined there once so far, and while my personal experience would not prevent me from returning, my dining companions from that night are likely not to return. When it takes three times to get a dish correct based on the initial order, there is either a communication issue between the server and the kitchen, or the server has not been properly trained or have the experience with various food-related allergies that can be life threatening to an individual. If you read the other Yelp reviews, you'll see a similar pattern where diners received meals that were not prepared to their specification. Our server was very friendly and apologetic, and ultimately the meal was served properly, but it is first experiences like this that will kill a restaurant.  That said, both my food and drink were good. I ordered the mahi tuna burger with fries. The filet of tuna was a little too large to eat the burger comfortably with my hands, so I resorted to a knife and fork; no big deal. The portion/price ratio was on the spot, so I don't feel like I overpaid. Our server was polite, attentive, and courteous, so no complaints there. I plan to dine there again in the near future, but I hope the owners are reading Yelp to see the areas of opportunity for their business. First impressions are lasting impressions, and diners these days are more finicky than ever.",

The food was great, drinks were strong, happy hour prices were fantastic, the service was above average and the ambiance was fabulous.    I had the Pain Killer- even at Happy Hour prices, the drink was full strength and a great blend of rum and tropical flavors.  We shared two appetizers, the pork taco (it says it is one, but there is enough meat for two) and the coconut shrimp rolls.  The pork was a great blend of sweet and savory and the shrimp rolls were filled with shrimp and coconut and served with a great dipping sauce.  We rounded out our tropical get-away with a lobster bisque that was hearty, filling and full of shredded lobster.  My daughter opted for the Island Style Poke.  The menu listed it as \"market price\"- but we lucked out and they had a double shipment that they wanted to move, so it was only $5 that day.  Even so, it was a hearty serving, which she took home with her, and would be well worth paying full price.  We live in Scottsdale, but were downtown that evening.  We will definitely check out the Scottsdale location- soon.",

    "text": "First I want to thank Hula for saving my date night.  We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back. I love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from, so I'm eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu.",

The 2011 NYE proved to be dastardly cold in Phoenix, so Hula was kind enough to move us in to restaurant table (this was at 9:30ish) so our big group didn't have to freeze outside. I enjoyed the Dr. Funk and it was delicious also we sampled the sweet potato fries and thought they were great as well.  Can't wait to make it back when it is tad warmer and enjoy the awesome out door patio and the full menu. Also Hula was easily accessible by light rail, some friends of ours came that way after the suns game.  I felt it was a truly unique kind of place.",

    "text": "Went to Hula's for the second time tonight, this time for dinner (Christmas eve nightcaps last time).  I was very impressed.  I should note that I live in small town, but I travel a fair bit.  The last time I had food of this sort, this good, was in New Orleans before Katerina.  The theme, modern, Pacific-island, with a touch of surfer, is fun.  The service has been fantastic - attentive, helpful, prompt, but not pushy or annoying.  The one small drink error we experienced was corrected immediately and satisfactorily.  The food is fantastic.  I went there with a craving for fish that was fulfilled and then some.  They have several different fish preparations, from pan-seared, to lemon grass encrusted, to a blackened wasabi, available with a variety of different fish.  The blackened wasabi ono I had was delicious, the wasabi was subtle and complimented the fish wonderfully.  I like my fish rare, and would probably request it that way next time, but it was certainly not overcooked.  The side dishes, seasonal vegetables (sauteed spinach) and wasabi mashed potatoes (fabulous) tied the dish together well.  Also had a couple appetizers (ceviche and poke), both wonderful.  Left filling satiated, but not stuffed.  My only suggestion is that they include Moscow Mules on their drink menu (as they have ginger beer), maybe with a island touch (pineapple or mango juice?).  Disappointed I don't live here, because this restaurant would certainly end up on my short list.",

First time I stopped in and enjoyed a cocktail (Mai Tai), which was superb, very well mixed! I stopped in again this past Sunday for the more full brunch experience. I ordered a \"Pain Killer\" to drink (Rum, Pineapple and Orange Juice with Coconut) and the Hula Burger, added cheddar and fried Spam...yes Spam. Who needs bacon when this is an option. LOL! Yeah so I was not counting calories or fat for this meal but, why am I justifyin' this to you. LOL. The burger patty was thick and quality beef, the grilled Maui onions superb and the special sauce was better than I was expecting. It was an aoli with fresh ginger, garlic and stuff (I feared it was going to be sweet originally), I was pleasantly pleased. I had to eat my burger in pieces this thing was huge and juicy. I will definitely be back again...their brunch cocktails are super and I like the open airy atmosphere of the place as a whole.",

    "text": "First part of the review has nothing to do with the food.  They took a long vacant building in the middle of an easy-to-miss strip mall and helped transform it into a architecturally significant restaurant which in turn attracted a modern set of proprietors.  The outdoor seating within the translucent fencing is perfect for the cooler months and the oversize firepit and tiki statue set a nice island vibe.  The inside of the original building is set up to show off the giant six sided window that now shows off the light rail as well as the church across the street.  The 20+ft vaulted ceiling is impressive and that allows there to be vintage surf videos projected on the opposite wall from the window. They take requests too. Blue Hawaii with Elvis was on during our visit.  Stained concrete floors, glass tile backsplashes, and stainless steel wrapped entryways are some of the modern touches while the vast and original collection of 60s period and surf memorabilia remind you that this is an island restaurant too.  The addition on to the original structure is where the majority of the dining area and has a unique i-beam table system where you can slide table tops along the top of the beam to transform from a table for 2 to a table for 8 in a flash.  Very creative.  The last and best feature is the garage doors that open up the bar and seating areas to our beautiful climate (most of the year).  We got there around 6 when the A/C was turned on, but once the sun was down and it cooled off, the doors were all opened and patrons all cheered!  Good concept that has become more popular especially with local restaurants that are willing to be a little more adventurous with their design, like Postino's and Vig.  We sat at the bar for almost three hours which not only gave us a change to order a half dozen appetizers and an entree, but we got to talk to a rotation of different patrons that ordered drinks and appetizers.  The had a limited menu for opening night, but it seemed like enough to choose from.  There is a good selection of wine and beer, but we thought it most appropriate to go for the specialty island drinks that they've been making for years at their California tiki restaurants.  Our favorites were the Ahi Poke with seaweed, shrimp rolls, and the Wasabi Crusted Ahi with Wasabi mashed potatoes for an entree.  Everything was very fresh, tasted great, and was priced reasonably.  Bar neighbors to our left and right tried the Hula burger, pork tenderloin, dumplings and all had good reviews.  I don't think that I would ever visit Hula's without ordering the Poke Ahi appetizer though.    I was a little skeptical on the combination of a Tiki and contemporary concept, but they comfortably coexist in a clean-lined mid-century modern way.  They're shooting for \"Houston's\" type of service and I think that they're on their way.  We're looking forward to working through the rest of the menu soon.  I'm glad to see how the Central Corridor is really livening up and there are a number of restaurants and bars to walk to from Hula's location.  Easy stop on the light rail, or what we hope will be popular is the extra large space for bicycle parking along the side of the restaurant.",

Love the patio with the fire pit and the bar is nice as well. I like this part of town and the restaurant fits in here well. The special drinks they have are great, I could suck them down all night,  but I was really hungry and could not wait to try the food. The food was very disapointing. Everything they serve has some crazy sause on it. I like sauces but I just feel they need a little more work on all the sauce i tried that night. The butterfish was cooked well and was great when I scraped all the sauce off of it. That fish is good and doesnt need a sauce like that. I understand the kind of food Im eating but mabey thay need to lighten  up the sauce a little. All the sauces I had seemed like they put a  mango and a pinapple in a blender and then poured it onto my food. You could not even taste the fish. It could be anything under that sauce and that would be all you taste. Then we went for the NY Steak sandwich. It comes with sauteed onions( enough onion for about 6 people) a roll that just falls apart the second you pick it up, and sliced steak that is way to thick and oh yeah one of those sauces again.  I dont mind my sanwiches being a little messsy but after two bites my sandwich looked like it was murdered and scattered all over the plate. When you took a bite everything fell out of the ass end of the roll. When I order a sandwich i dont want to assemble it after every bite nor do I want to eat my SANDWICH WITH A FORK. And again it could have been a piece of plasitic under that roll cause all i tasted was the sauce. I will say the sweet potato fries were not to bad. I dont like sweet potatos really but these were good. I did find out later that they do have regular fries but THEY DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU, not sure why mabey cause they dont want you to be happy or they are just pushing the sweet potato fries. Whatever the reason I did not like that, cause I would have prefered regular fries.  Im there to eat and if you make it put it on the menu! Overall this place is cool and the servers are friendly, attentive, and knowlegeable about the menue     ( - the fries) but I think the Head Chef should sample all the dishes himself and think about what he is doing in that kitchen. This place could be so much better. Prime location, great atmosphere, just lacking in the food department. Im not sure if all the good reviews are from people that got sidetracked from the atmosphere or if they dont know food and thought they were eating something special or if they had to many drinks before the food. I wanted to like this place so much. I will be back for drinks and to relax by the fire pit but Im not sure i will eat here again.",

No one in our group had ever been there before, so it was a treat to try out a new place... but, also, sort of a gamble, because we weren't sure what to expect and we have quite a few picky eaters in the bunch.  To my surprise and pleasure, everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal!  I got the Luau Pork Sandwich, which the menu claims to be \"heaven on a bun\" and they were not lying!  It was so delicious.  The boyfriend got the Bali Hai BBQ Ribs and the meat was literally falling off the bone.  It was perfectly cooked.  His only complaint was that the sweet potato fries were too sweet and didn't go with the ribs.  I think he would have preferred the wasabi mashed potatoes instead.  I wanted to order one of everything off the drink menu, because I couldn't make up my mind.  Everything sounded good!  Our waiter was so attentive.  He very discretely circled around his tables every few minutes or so to make sure everyone was taken care of, but he didn't interrupt the meal, unless, of course, you flagged him down for something.  It was a really great experience and I can't wait to go back there again!",

We tried every damn drink on the menu!!  So then it was time to eat! Calamari was fantastic, Coconut Shrimp Rolls were the \"bomb\" and Ahi Tuna Wontons rocked our palates!! Island Poke and Spicy Seaweed Salad were great too! No, we didnt eat this all in one night! We told you we went there two nights in a row!! :)  Great Cocktails!! Great Food!! Great Service!!

But you know every restaurant has to have it's own drag, and Hula's got that going on.  Is dinner a life altering experience? no. Is everything about the restaurant perfect? no. But man they try really hard. I have yet to walk in the door and not been greeted with smiles and \"glad your here\"s . And on top of that I really like the food. It's fun, casual, priced just right. I don't know about the prices of the specialty cocktails but their wine and martinis are priced great. And don't let the \"modern tiki\" thing scare you. It's a nice twist but not too much on the tiki. I have taken three or four of my friends and they have loved the place. I had the ribs last time and they were incredible. So it's really nice to have something other than a steak on a plate or how good can you cook 20 different hamburgers. It's a great place and I will be back for dinner again this week I'm sure. Oh and if I haven't made it really clear the staff just couldn't be more caring and enthusiastic. The manager is a great you can really tell he's working hard to make this place a success",

The place looks very cool from the outside, and I thought the inside was Tiki-inspired enough to be fun, but not offensively cheezy. There is a large open patio area with a few tables - seemed more for casual cocktail seating, but there were also a couple of large tables out there with big groups of people. They could probably pack in a few more tables out on the patio, 'specially now that the weather is perfect for sipping umbrella-style drinks outside. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but a friend I was with gave high marks. I tried three of the fruity concoctions on the drink menu - 2 out of 3 were yummy, especially the Mai Tai, but the blood orange martini still needs some work. Not bad, just not exceptional. I didn't see any type of happy hour specials, but the prices were OK - about $7 per girly drink. Bartenders were great at suggesting drinks and were very friendly. By about 8, the bar crowd had really thinned out which was disappointing, but I'm hoping that won't be the case much longer as more people discover it. I'm looking forward to heading back.",

    "text": "A group of us stopped in here on a Friday night, because we had heard it was finally open and wanted to see what it was all about. We all love retro type places and things, so the idea of a new tiki bar was kind of exciting!   Alas....it just wasn't a very good experience, even though our server was trying really hard to make it right. I would give him personally 5 stars for that. But it was just boring. I wanted it to be different, I guess. I know that the owners have worked really hard, and I can appreciate that very much. A lot of time and thought went into the decor, and it shows, if you like the watered down idea of tiki. (I liked the artwork.) There was just no....soul. When I think of tiki, I see over the top. It just seemed like another bland contemporary place to drink. Maybe if I was a young hipster I would have enjoyed it better. I asked for a daiquiri but they apparently don't do blended drinks. At a TIKI bar they don't?! I was amazed. Then they couldn't get my other drink choice right so the bartender sent a mystery drink over but didn't tell me or the server what it was. I didn't like it, and I didn't really appreciate just being thrown something randomly. I always carry the recipe for my drink with me, and even with that the bartender couldn't get it right. Also, the water we were served tasted terrible and had floaty things in it. I have very specific taste and I do know this, but I was really hoping for something better. None of us wanted to come back.",

    "text": "I'm torn on this rating.  Two stars is \"Meh, I've experienced better.\", and I have.  Three stars is \"A-OK\", which it  was.    Had the manager not compensated me for the ridiculously small plate of ribs I got, this review would be scathing.  But he did make it mostly right and that went a long way towards fixing the overall experience to a third star.  But two things about the third star:  I shouldn't have to feel like a cheapass by wondering if I got a full rack or a half rack.  The food didn't feel like anything special, which would have been acceptable if the prices were far lower.     Two stars it is.    Our party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area, a little lost for a good place to go.  I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night, which it definitely is.  Tonight, we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch.   However, i'm having difficulty with this whole hipster thing where the wait staff dresses in  street clothes.  It weirds me out and it's almost insulting for as expensive as the place is.    I totally dig the overall ambience.  The restaurant itself appears to be in a rehabbed auto mechanic's shop, creating something totally unique in a region of unique rehabs.  The comfortable patio hangs right off Central Avenue, creating a rare big-city kinda place in Phoenix.  The fire pit is just cool, they play good and fun music.   Ambience is about the one thing about this place that actually lines up with the price, contributing solidly to Uptown's burgeoning vibe.  The beer selection felt weak.  We didn't order cocktails, so I can't comment on that.    Going through our courses....The potstickers were good, but the thai peanut sauce just tasted weird.  The spicy edamame was an interesting twist but I didn't find myself very hungry for it   My friend ordered the cajun burger which he thought was \"mediocre.\"  I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic, altho the fries and slaw were pretty good.   The meat, yeah I wolfed it down, but in the end it didn't seem like anything to write home about.    The food and drink, all in all, felt more or less average.  The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food.     Given the other choices in the area that I still need to try out, I don't see much of a reason to come back for dinner again.",

    "text": "Color me convinced.  When I first heard about the concept of a modern tiki restaurant, I was skeptical.  When I saw the early demo/renovations to the classic uptown building, while hanging out at neighboring Lola's, I was worried.  After stepping inside today, however,  I realized that my skepticism and worries were unwarranted. Hula's Modern Tiki is a great addition to the uptown dining and lounge scene. They have effortlessly matched an uptown modern vibe with a retro tiki kitsch.  The cocktail menu is quite extensive, with a lot of fun options, including Dr. Funk, served in a Fun Man Chu mug and the Tiki Bastard.  They also have a variety of bottle beers, including some choices from the Caribbean and Hawa'ii. Their food is all island inspired, with a hearty collection for seafood based appetizers (pupus) and mains, as well as some other island inspired selections, such as Duke's Luau Pork Plate.  Our food was well flavored, especially my wife's fish tacos.  On the down side, my pork was on the dry side.  To their credit, after mentioning this to the owner, Dana, he took 50% off the entree price).  The servers and staff,  were extremely friendly and attentive, perhaps a little too much so, although i chalk it up to opening night jitters and a full staff fort a less than full house.   Give the cool vibe, great seafood and wide drink selection, Hula's Modern Tiki is set to become an uptown classic, especially as they work out a few remaining kinks in the kitchen.  As you begin migrating out to the patios with the cooler weather, be sure to stop by Hula's-- it's patio, complete with fire pit is a great place to hang out over a cocktail or two, or even more,  given its proximately to the light rail.",

We've been watching the transformation of the old building shell and now it has turned into a very comfortable place to have a cocktail.  That being said, that's probably all I would do here.  The food was less than exciting.    When we arrived we noticed seating on the patio was sparse.  It wasn't very busy at all, yet all the seating outside was taken and no one was sitting inside.  They seem big on the \"Community Seating\" too which I find a waste because there will no doubt be chairs unused because people won't want to sit next to others.   I had a hamburger and it was Ok, but to be honest Mazies just up the block has a MUCH better burger.    Our waitress was a little on the clueless side. She didn't know what was in some of the dishes. She couldn't recommend food to us.  At the end she just asked \"Do you want desert?\"  I though, Umm not really but what is it?  If you told me what it was, I might be more tempted.   The drinks were VERY good.  Typically at restaurants they give you the watered down version of signature drinks but these really did have a good kick to them.  I had the Mai Tai and I totally recommend it!   Others at our table enjoyed their drinks as well.

Living in Arizona I am always looking for a great new patio spot. Hulas is one of my favorite on Central, the noise of the train and the light foot traffic makes for fun people watching and the gas fire pit in the middle gives it a great feel. Being a big fan of Sweet Potato fries I naturally ordered a basket while waiting for my burger, which comes without a side. which was OK because my friend and I just split the fries anyway. they are great, he is not a big fan of aoili, me on the other hand loved the ginger aoili dipping sauce it came with.   I have been back to Hulas a few times and have found that ALL the appetizers are enjoyable and when purchased in a group of 4 it makes for a great place to get your night started. A scorpion or Volcano Bowl never hurts either for that \"pregame\" buzzzzz. the appetizers seem to all compliment each other perfectly.  my favorite thing to get here is the Pork sandwich....  it is a great blend of sweet and savory and the slaw adds the perfect cruch to it. I will for sure be back, not just because it is so close, but the patio.... I cant get over this patio!!!",

We each had one drink and apps.  I had the Painkiller, my friends had a glass of wine and the Mai Tai.  For the apps we each had a pork taco, and shared the crispy coconut shrimp rolls, and hawaiian ceviche.  Service was good, we enjoyed our food and drink and went on our way.  That brings me to 1:00 am.  I woke up with the most aggressive intestinal pain I have ever experienced.  To go along with the pain I also had hot and cold flashes followed by sweats.  This morning I texted my friends to see if they had the same experience.  Both said they woke up this morning nauseous.  Was it the food or my drink, (my friends each had a sip)?  Either way, we will NOT be returning.",

Now almost a year and a half after it opened, and a bunch of reviews, I finally had the opportunity to dine here.  I was amongst a Smunch group that met for brunch on a Saturday.    I love the space. A combination of indoor, outdoor and part of both.    The service for our party of about 20 was really great.  Our group consisted of folks from 1 to over 60 and all our needs were well attended to.  Their brunch menu consists of items from their regular corporate menu and some special items designed locally.  I chose the Island Eggs Benedict and enjoyed it and the hash browns it came with.  I ordered the decaf and it is the first decaf I have had in a long time that tasted like a real cup of coffee!  At least at our table I heard no big complaints about the food.  A couple of things that kept my rating at 3.5 instead of 4:  Parking sucks, this is more important to those like myself not used to uptown/downtown venues. One of my poached eggs was hard cooked in the middle.  I would certainly not complain about going here again.",

It was on a Wednesday night, so they happened to have an all night happy hour on that day. We surely lucked out, so we enjoyed  $5 appetizers and discounted beverages all night.  I love the spicy edename, but I didn't really care for the black bean burger. My friends also ordered food which they deemed satisfactory. I can't decide if it's overpriced or not though. I could barely finish my burger and mash (that doesn't happen very often),but paying $7 to $8 for your signature drinks seems kinda steep. Happy Hour is definitely the time to come here in order to get the discounted price.   I do love the delightful modern kitschy decor and the friendly atmosphere. I'd definitely come back here again and give them another try. Perhaps meet up with friends on a weekend to enjoy a brunch.",

For starters, we've tried the lobster bisque, calamari, fish cakes, ceviche (a favorite), and the ahi wontons (another favorite). For the main entree, which is where the needle continued to point a neutral to below neutral, was the \"jerk\" chicken and the one of the fishes with the jamaican jerk sauce. Welp.. I've never had shredded, marinated of sorts, jerk chicken.. the outcome was unfortunate. The fish was better than the chicken, but still left me hoping for something.  I'd go back for starters or even exploring their pretty cool happy hour specials, but not in a hurry for a seated dinner.  Recommendation: Always make a reservation if you can. Also note, they do not take same day reservations.",

That being said, everything else was awesome. It has a very cool vibe inside. The layout of the tables and the patio works. We were there kind of early on a Saturday night, around 6. There were plenty of open tables on the patio (because it's Arizona, June, 6pm, HOT) but since we were meeting a large group later we found a couple of seats at the bar. I did notice the dining room was full. Our group was going to be there around 7, so we had an hour to kill. After we were seated at the bar, our We first sat at the bar and had some appetizers and drinks. The food was all incredible and the drinks were quite tasty. Around 7:30 we decided to join our group so we moved out to the patio. There were 15 of us in all on the patio and we were never left wanting. Our server kept our water glasses filled as well as our drinks. As I said, the only thing I wish they had was a misting system or some way to cool off the patio. It was a bit sticky out there. Arizonan's, we get it. This is my new favorite down town spot.",

But it is growing on me. I enjoy their happy hour and I have now tried most all of their signature cocktails. I must say, i am quite happy with what they have to offer. Also, it is pretty interesting and curious that they carry every single Absolut flavor. there are so many more than I knew even existed to be perfectly honest. But then again, a lot of their drinks are fruity so you need the different flavors to diversify your cocktail list. i get it.  As for the food, I tried the shrimp things again and this time they were delicious. I have also since tried their tacos, ceviche and a few others that are not necessarily note worthy but still tasty none the less. I do appreciate the company I keep every time I come here, whether it be friend, colleague or date. The bartenders are also decent conversationalists so thanks to you above average intelligent bartenders. Kudos to you! :)  I will keep coming here on and off so you have nothing to worry about... you most likely made me a lifer!",

The interior is very mid-century modern, which I love, and the service was outstanding. Everything was clean and dishes were removed from the table almost as quickly as I could clear them.  Ordered the Potstickers (which were delicious!!) and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, which was yummy. Nothing to write home about, but good enough that I intend to go back and explore more of the menu.  They've got a fun list of cocktails, too, if you're into that sort of thing. I'd recommend this place for sure, and I do plan to visit again in the near future.",

I'm glad we ditched Oregano's with their lousy service for the accommodating staff at Hula's, as it has now become a regular hangout for us.    The atmosphere is modern and very relaxing.  Can be a great place for drinks or dinner.  Nicely situated along the light rail and across the street from a large cathedral, it's probably one of the few restaurant patios in Phoenix that offers more than just a view of exhaust fumes from passing cars.  Love the gas fire pit in the center of the patio.  A lot of great options on the menu, especially the seafood centered appetizers.  My personal favorites are the pork tacos and the Teriyaki New York Strip.  Their tropical drink menu may be their real highlight and seems to attract a lot of local hipsters.  I always stick with their Mai Tai, which isn't overly sweet and packs a good punch.  The owner seems to care a lot about his restaurant and is very welcoming to his customer's.  It's nice to go to a place where you're recognized and appreciated as a regular.",

    "text": "This place is just really adorable.  It has a tiki-theme and they have indoor and outdoor seating just about year round.  When it is a bit chilly there are heaters on the patio and an open firepit.  It's kind of a trendy little spot, and very popular.  I have had really great service all but one time I was there (everyone has an off night).  I love spicy food and the edamame is something I always get here, but they are not for everyone - apparently non-New Mexico natives find it too hot.  Whatever, wimps.  I am addicted to the fish tacos, and a friend of mind swears by the pork tacos.  You can get a couple of good drinks and a decent dinner here for $25 bucks easily, especially if you get there during happy hour.  There are even some semi-healthy options, although that is not their strong suit - with jerk pork you have to pay in calories for what you get in yumminess.  They have another location in Monterey and it is divier and beachier, but the same great food.  Go!  Eat!",

You can even bring your dog onto the patio.  The bartenders all seem really pretentious.  The owner should send them over to Ve Bene in Ahwatukee to see how a good bartender interacts with their patrons. They don't offer any drink specials at night and drinking there can get pricey.  I guess that's why they are always pretty slow when I drive by.  Maybe they think they are keeping out the riff raff. ;o)",

Lets start with the all day happy hour on Saturday and Sunday.... who can be disappointed with $2.00 mimosas? They were in a small flute which went down quite quick and easy, then we went for the house made bloody mary - simply delicious!! The food was great... ahi eggs benedict & the hula hangover was what we finally decided on, but can't wait to go back to try the next thing on the menu! We were also excited to see it was on the metro-lightrail route. The architecture was cool and it was a beautiful day to sit out on the patio. We couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the day... it was yummy and a delightful experience! We highly recommend it :)",

We went in the early evening (maybe 5:30 or 6) to partake in some happy hour specials and ordered ceviche, one of the house specials.  The ceviche we received had obviously been sitting for awhile, as the fish was mushy to the point that you would've been better off eating it with a spoon - gross.  Luckily, the waitress agreed that the batch was way off and removed it from the bill.  Coconut shrimp rolls were crispy and tasty, and we loved our mai tai and dark and stormy.  We were planning on splitting the macadamia encrusted butterfish with mango sauce, but when we tried it, my boyfriend gagged and refused to eat another bite.  I thought the flavors were a bit strange/overly sweet but would've given it more of a chance.  However, at that time, friends of ours called and invited us to join them at Pita Jungle, so we just paid and left.    Waste of money, but now we know: come here for drinks and cooked apps and beware of the fish!",

Hula's was a new place and by the stars above you can imagine how my visit was.  We had put in reservations for 25 people here and while they were hesitant they happily put us outside on this large table under the misters and shade.  Perfect setting.  I don't recall the waitress name, but she did something great in the beginning.  We all would be on separate tabs and she wrote all our names down.  Some places go by where you sit and will flip out if you move. She rocked this.  We all started with many drinks and any appetizers.  Let me tell you this.. I hate sweet potato fries.  I really do.. however their sweet potato fries with their dipping sauce was to die for.  I couldn't eat enough of them.  I kept looking at my friends with this \"are you kidding me??\" face.   Delicious  Dinner came and it was ncie to literally see everyone order something different.  If you have friends and dinner that means you have a ton of food to sample.  We did just that.    I ordered the Ahi Wasabi Bowl on white rice with black beans.  Holy crap that was amazing.  I usually get a burger, but wanted to break my burger streak.. so I did this.  A few friends did burgers and I did sample some of them.  I couldn't believe how good they were!  The drinks were awesome, food was great and the service at this place just kicks ass all over town.  I can't wait to go back!!",

It comes with colorful huge straws that you can use hit each other with afterwards, too. :)  It's also conveniently located off the light rail and the patio outside is nice and lively.

I love Hula's patio and fire pit...it is so nice on a cool day to sit by the fire while enjoying some beverages. Speaking of beverages, Hula's has a fantastic happy hour ('Tiki Time'). Drinks are about 5$ and it goes until 7 pm, even on Saturdays. This is craziness! The BF and I went there a few weeks ago and drank many many beverages (He likes the Dr. Funk and I am in love with the Lilikoi margarita (it is very tasty, trust me)) and the bill was still very reasonable. The food is somewhat hit and miss (hence the 4 star review), they have delicious jerk pulled pork that is always good, but other items were a miss such as the potstickers (tasted like Ling Ling's), the macadamia crusted fish (was pretty bland), and the chicken tacos (too big and not flavorful enough). I would probably stick to the pork. I STILL haven't had their coconut banana pie, but it always looks good....I might go there tonight and get it :-D.",

There's even a drink that comes with a backscratcher? kinda weird. For a good time, order the volcano bowl: a multitude of rums, juices, and flaming shot of 151 in the middle, all in a giant bowl.  The really service sucks sometimes. - 1 star for that",

Sauce was supposed to be pineapple/horseradish, but didn't seem at all horseradishey.  Our server (Katherine) was great! On top of refills, food orders, friendly, and fast! Bar itself was nice, was showing reruns of Gilligan's Island. Great patio seating, especially this time of year!",

Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.  Environment- I would give an A. First  I will say it is beautifully laid out! It was around 8pm on a Saturday night, so there were tons of people having dinner over drinks with good company. The hostesses were really nice and I was expecting a pretty good night.  Server- He was pleasant, he gave my boyfriend and I \"space\" which was nice BUT it was annoying having to track him down for refills and changes to our order. Like I said, he was nice but could have been more attentive   Food- Nothing special at all. For appatizers we did fish cakes and potstickers which had tons of flavor.  I also ordered a side of plantains, unfortunately they were still frozen when I bit into them so I sent them back.  I ordered tacos and my boyfriend ordered jawaiian jerk chicken plate, we both agreed our food was bland and mediocre at best. Because it was his birthday I also ordered him a warm brownie which was on the dry and hard side.  Overall, the environment is great but the service and food left something to be desired. I would only return for maybe drinks during  happy hour at the bar.  DINNER TOTAL: $54.15",

The shrimp and vegetables(?) in the rolls were savory and delicious. There was a nice blend of textures, with a nice crunch from the roll. The cool pineapple-horseradish dipping sauce was slightly sweet and served as a great complement to the savory warm shrimp roll. I would definitely want to try this again!  Hurricane: This drink was strong! As someone who doesn't drink frequently, I was done after this one drink. Lightweights, beware! The drink tasted a bit too strong for me, so I probably wouldn't order this again.",

They do have a few gluten-free options as well. My favorite is the habanero lime chicken tacos. They have a pretty decent happy hour. I also particularly like the sweet potato fries and a lot of the appetizers are really good. The key lime pie is incredible! The dishes are good size and I feel like you get your moneys worth. Most of all I just find incredibly relaxing to be sitting outside in downtown Phoenix at night in front of a fire pit enjoying some great food!",

We had the beef and chicken skewers with amazing dipping sauces for apps. I loved the variety here. I had the Korean kalbi as recommended by our super nice server. And everyone else loved their dishes, too.  On a side note, the restaurant is so light, airy and vacation-like and the bathroom made me want to redo mine. Is that weird?",

The restaurant seemed very casual & laid back, I was loving the vibe already!  After we were seated about 15 minutes later, our server came by. We put an order in for the Scorpion Bowl and the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes appetizer. It was fun to see the Scorpion bowl come out with the flaming rum float in the middle. I personally enjoy fruity drinks so I was totally on board with this drink and would get it again! The Spicy Thai Fish Cakes came out just a little bit after and they were really tasty. Not really that spicy but more so flavorful. I'd definitely recommend these!  Then, for dinner, I got an order of Hula's Baja Fish Tacos. The fish was flaky and crispy but the taco didn't pack as much flavor as I was hoping. I'd venture on to trying one of the other taco options in the future but did enjoy my meal. My husband got the Luau Pork Sandwich for his meal and enjoyed it. I tried just a bite and liked it as well!  Overall, a good experience! They have Happy Hour specials M-F from 3:30p-6:00p. I'd definitely come back, especially to try some of their other cocktail & appetizers.",

It says it is meant for 2-4 people, and they aren't kidding! The drink felt like it was poorly mixed initially but after giving it a stir it was quite tasty, though strong. My wife and I shared it and were definitely feeling it on the way home.   The Hawaiian ceviche was phenomenal - very heavy on the fish with beautiful acid flavor, served with wonton chips without anything distracting to the purity of the product. It's been a week and my wife is already talking about how she wants to go back just for the ceviche.  We did each get the fresh fish special - I ate the hapu served jerk style and my wife got the ahi lemongrass encrusted. quite enjoyed mine, it was a good combination of flavors - though the Jamaican style corn bread it came with was somewhat strange. My wife's didn't work quite as well, I don't think the tuna played well with the lemongrass flavors.  All in all, definitely coming back sometime.",

Not even close.  So eating food with a Hawaiian and Polynesian flair is such a nice change from chowdah.    First of all, the place has as cool, open vibe with an outdoor patio and firepit.   The service has always been excellent and the staff super friendly.  However, the real winner is their food.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.   From the spicy edamame (bring your tissues), to the johnny cakes, to the jerk chicken and mongolian beef bowls and fish tacos, it's all outstanding.  Their flavors work so well together, and everything is cooked to perfection.   I have never had a meal I didn't savor.  I come to Phoenix every few months for work and always try to make this place a stop.   Love it!",

I love this place as it's very well priced and a fun place to hang out. The servers always make sure we're taken care of while not making us feel rushed.  This visit I had a few mimosas and they were great. We had the sweet potato fries and potstickers to hold us to dinner and they were super good.  All in all, I love hula's. This is one of my favorite places to go to lounge and have a few drinks. Thanks hula's! I'll be back soon!",

Hulas does classic tiki drinks well and has a good happy hour! -8 dollar cocktails are only 6!- and they have a bunch of food items for a good deal too.  My favourite drink here is the pink bikini martini. It's super sweet, almost candy like but I love it. If you like a zombie? They do a really nice one. If you want to have a crazy night, order the scorpion bowl to share! It comes with a little fire in the middle and tastes great, but you'll definitely be feeling it after one of those!  I like to order the potstickers and wings on happy hour. It's a good deal and the wings have a bit of heat and sweetness to them, and they are of course smothered in sauce. The potstickers are just delicious, I can't even say why, the combination of meat and fried dough and those bomb dipping sauces...damn!  I've had the burger here too and it's good. I don't think it's on happy hour though.  They have specials almost everyday of the week, check the Facebook page before you go.",

We had 17 people in our party and every single dish looked delicious. I immediately had dinner envy though when my friend's ahi tuna Caesar arrived. It had a generous heap of perfectly cooked ahi on top!  Attentive staff. Clean dining room. Good food and cocktails. Definitely worth s visit!",

    "text": "Being familiar with the 90's tiki bar trend of tired, low-grade pseudo-Polynesian food, coupled with overpowered rum drinks, I approached the family's suggestion to try Hula's with some hesitation.  Much to my surprise, Hula's is quite different than the prior-century icon.  In a warm and inviting Old Town storefront, Hula's dim lighting, ample space and large central bar immediately brought to mind a comfortable dining and drinking environment.  Jazmine, our waitress, was patient, quite informative and quick to deliver our order.  We ordered a shared portion of the whitefish cerviche appetizer, and it was good.  The marinating of the fish in lime juice appeared to have been rushed, as neither fully tenderized fish nor a fully developed flavor profile were the result.  Next, we each ordered entrees and generously sampled from each plate.  The macadamia-crusted ahi, served medium rare, was very good.  A large cut of quality ahi in a nicely seasoned crust preserved the subtle balance of flavors between the two.  The luau-style pulled pork was tasty, if a bit sweet for my tastes.  Laced with a small dice of pineapple and pineapple juice, it remained satisfying none the less.  A scoop of jasmine rice helped to balance the flavors.  The star of the evening, however, was our older son's jerk pork.  Shredded, with a pleasant heat and light curry flavor, the dish was identifiable from its Caribbean origins, yet uniquely Hawaiian.  Portions are very large, and quite fortunately, the food was delicious enough to make this \"a good thing.\"  Hula's Modern Tiki is a clever concept which, as the crowded dining room will attest, serves very good food.  Dinner for the four of us, pre-tip, was $75.50, making Hula's an outstanding value as well.",

I found it to be a bit pricey for the area -- $14 for a platter of chicken, rice and plantains. But aside from the crunchy rice, it was good.  My problem came at the end of my visit. Our server informed me that she used my card to ring up someone else's check (it was almost double the price of my check). She informed me that she took care of it and it would straighten out in a couple days. No worries, it happens. What she failed to tell me was that not only did she charge my card for the wrong check, she also charged me for my check. Double swipe = double charge. I was under the impression she just refunded the difference. This caused an enormous headache for me. It was a Friday night. Because she swiped my card twice, it put a fraudulent security hold on my card. I was unable to use it all weekend long. By the time I got everything sorted out and got my money back, it was Wednesday.   This isn't something that should've been handled by a server. This was a management problem. If she would have come over and told me right away what happened, I would have just opted to pay her in cash. I know sometimes that double swipe sends my security settings into an angry frenzy. I'm hoping this was an isolated incident and not something generally handled by servers. The event caused me such a headache, I will definitely not be back.",

The girl put us right in the middle on a tiny table next to a family nothing wrong with kids I have 3 but I didn't have space to put my purse down because the kid had his stuff right next to me.. Then on the other side was another couple and we were so close that it was hard for me and my husband to enjoy ourselves because it just feels like not enough space and we were so close to the 2 families that we couldn't even hear our own conversation...spacing is important it helps to promote a relaxing atmosphere and feel welcoming this made us so uncomfortable that all we had was coconut shrimp rolls which are my faves and sweet potato fries.. Food is awesome but I can't enjoy my food if I can't feel comfortable with space in a restraunt.. Me and my husband love the hula bar and we will go back it's our fave place to go and to hang out but Scottsdale is where we will be going it's a lot more spacey  Went to try out this hula bar with some friends since it's closer to home... Loved it we got the scorpion bowl and also my faves coconut shrimp rolls and sweet potato frys... It was yummy... And mixed drinks were good also :) and we brought friends to try it out and they loved it, they said food was yummy :) and they would definitely come back :) thanks again hula bar!!!",

I love sitting inside by the large glass window, or in the area where you're half in half out and the breeze gently blows, or outside by the fire pit where my pooch gets a water bowl and even sits next to me on the comfy-couchy chairs. The mood is relaxed yet lively.  I hate the jammed parking. They need a parking lot across the street and not one shared with a mini mall where an accident is just waiting to happen. Even walking through it feels like a disaster.   Now for the food.....it's Hawaiian/Asian mix sort of....I've been here a ton and I still don't quite know where to put in on the food chain. In the past I always had the raw tuna poke. See it was so delicious I didn't venture far on the menu because I could never get enough of it. This last time it was WAY salty and WAY over seasoned with soysauce. What happened to all the fun flavors that use to be swimming in there? I also had the thai chicken wings which were fine but nothing to write home about. The ceviche was outstanding though. Great hint of lime flavor and fresh! Hubby had the kalbi short ribs and again my man of many words states \"They were good, I liked them\". I tried them and they were seasoned OK, not the kalbi I'm used to that you can't put down until you've sucked all the juice out. So from all the times I use to love this place to this last visit of slightly above average food....it use to be one of our favorite places in Phoenix so I'm sticking with 4ish stars for now.",

The four stars is based on a happy hour experience.  The drink options were great and I ordered so many happy hour items that I was stuffed.  Items on the table include hawaiian ceviche (good), crispy coconut shrimp rolls (ok), sweet potato fries (can't go wrong with sweet potatoe fries), spicy thai fish cakes (ok), calamari (not a HH item, but tasty), and pork tacos (good). I also ordered a drink, but don't ask me which it was because I don't remember.  It was good though.   For two people, it was around $40 - but both of us were stuffed.",

We ordered taco plates, my guy got the chile chicken and I got the spicy shrimp and we shared one each. We are fans of trying errythang. Mo also ordered the chile chicken which was made with a fresh green chile salsa, mild yet flavorful.   We stayed there for hours, drinking Mai Tai's and Kona beers like we were on a beach somewhere yet out in the heat. We had an amazing time with great service that I won't forget. Thank you Hula's.",

    "text": "I was tempted to grab a grass skirt and wiggle into Hula's for their Tiki Time Happy Hour (Monday - Friday 3:30-6pm). But I opted for the Phoenix summer staple: a sundress and flip-flops. Love the mid-century modern feel. That gets a star :)  It was around 5:30pm and it was busy, but our server came over and took our drink orders when she saw us join a friend's table. I asked for Malibu and Pineapple and my friend Zombie'd out. We were given menus and she left without clearing any plates on our table, where our friends had several (not to mention a couple empty glasses).  She came back with the Zombie and told me they didn't have Malibu (what a disgrace to Tikiville's everywhere!!) but the bartender said I wouldn't know the difference and to bring me this. She set it down. I looked at her and said, \"No, thanks.\" AUTOMATIC MINUS TWO STARS - one for NOT having Malibu and another one for trying to pass the fake crap off.  I ordered the Surfrider Chicken Sticks and Steak Tacos while my friend ordered the Mango Chicken Caesar (someone else in our party had ordered it and enjoyed it). She didn't take our menus and all of our drink glasses were empty. A few comments were made about this.  Ten minutes later, we get the Surfrider Chicken Sticks which were SET ON TOP OF MY MENU (damn, really??). They were cold. Decent, but cold nonetheless. My friend's salad came and I was told it would be a minute for the tacos. Another 20 minutes and they still hadn't come. Not to mention my empty plate SITTING ON TOP OF A MENU, empty water glass and my friend's empty glass.  A couple friends got up to leave and their empty plates and glasses remained even after WE got our check. I was billed for the tacos but I never got them. It took another 10 minutes for her to return with a correct bill.   Awful service, cold food, no food and a fake-Malibu serving bartender give this place ONE star in my book.",

    "text": "This review is more of a 3.5 star one, but I round down as a general rule.  We hit up Hula's tonight for dinner. All in all, some good-sized portions (I had the half rack of ribs), decent sides, and very good service.  My ribs were a bit pedestrian: it said mango BBQ, but it was basically just... BBQ sauce. Nothing wrong with that, but nothing amazing going on here either. The ribs were cooked well enough, coated in sauce (I enjoy both dry and sauce-drenched, so no big issue here) and they were just fine. They just weren't anything too special.   The sweet potato fries were dead-on, and the aioli, while it could've used just a bit more kick and a bit less mayonnaise, was a good touch.  The mac 'n cheese was a big disappointment to me. The noodles were over-salted, almost as if they had salted the water entirely too much, and it just had nothing special going for it.  Mac 'n cheese is a tricky beast: you have to convince the eater that this is worth the calories and shame, and this one failed desperately in that regard. Not enough flavor and yet, too salty. A good sized portion for $5, though.  The girl had a pulled pork sandwich which was tasty enough, and she really enjoyed her side house salad. (It was tasty. I tried a bite.)  Our friend had the Hula Burger and it looked big and cooked nicely, and she seemed pleased.  Overall, a decent meal. The service was very good, the ambiance was fun and open, and it was definitely serviceable. I'd like to go back and try one of their fish options in the future, since they had a good selection of mix-and-match fish and prep styles that sounded really fun.",

If you're trying out something new, it's not a good idea. our food, which consisted of a lunch salad, sandwich and sweet potato fries took forever. The fries were cold, the ahi tuna very very over cooked and hardly any pink. Please get better soon. I will probably be back, but I will make sure it's not during lunch and that I order something different.",

Drinks were great -- definitely liking the laid back, tropic vibe.  Food was decent (macadamia encrusted mahi, ribs), but didn't raise the bar for food of this type.  Only downfall was service -- our appetizer never made it, and extra drink did (not complaining about that!), had to ask for our waiter on a few occasions, and the check took a lot longer than would be expected.  My bottom line:  Would love to hit this place at happy hour or late night drinks, but would probably look elsewhere if I were looking for an above-average meal.",

The heater was really hot and could have been turned down a bit.  I had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries and side of sweet plantains. The steak was chewy so I had to cut it up in tiny pieces. I must admit that I had a late lunch so I was not hungry and should have saved room for dinner but everything tasted fine. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and my girly, Dr.Funk drink. Worked up a good buzz.  I need to come back for more.

    "text": "Love Hula's! I have been going there for just over a year now, and take people there every chance I get. Everyone who goes enjoys the food, the atmosphere, and the service. It is certainly a unique place with a laid back attitude and funky decor, but it appeals to many people. One of my favorites is to get the potstickers as an appetizer, followed by the luau pork sandwich- as the menu reads, it is \"heaven on a bun\". And that is an accurate description! The mixed drinks are great, as is the iced tea. If you have not tried the banana cream pie, get to Hula's NOW for this amazingly decadent yet remarkably light and delicious dessert. The service is great, and the staff knows the menu and is happy to help you- there does not seem to be \"not my table\" attitude there- they want to make you happy. I have had two birthdays there, as well as other celebrations. I am sad it took me so long to find this great place, but I look forward to many more meals there. Note to fellow dog owners- Hula's is VERY dog friendly with seating on the patio with heating or misters depending on the season and water bowls for the pooches. Expect lots of visits from the crew of Hula's so they can say hi!",

Clean, friendly, and an awesome drink menu! Cuisine offers a mix of seafood and island favorites with your standard burgers, steaks and fries. Vegetarian options are readily available. Our party had no problems with service on a busy saturday night. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes, cooked medium rare. I'm not the biggest fan of ribeyes, and the price was a little steep, but overall the meal was flavorful and hot. I'd have to say that the real highlight here is their tropical drinks. Men, here is a bar where you can order a Mai Tai with no shame. No touristy girl drinks here, only strong Mai Tais made with excellent rum! If you're a fan of the 50s and 60s like I am, or you're looking for something new for dinner and drinks, try it out!",

Our server who was cute as a button picked up our \"we are not in a hurry vibe\" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again. There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size. Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me. Overall though I give the place a B+",

He got there and we both ordered a beer, and he got the hula burger and I had the coconut shrimp roles with a side of plantains.  The shrimp rolls were good, not amazing but I would get them again and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  I stole a few fries and they were awesome.  I wasn't that impressed with the plantains- I'm used to a different preparation but they were okay.  I would definitely go back for the great atmosphere and to try out some of their specialty drinks.",

    "text": "When you take a look at a place like Hula's and see that it has eighty-eight reviews it makes you think, does it really matter if I put in my two cents? Well maybe Hula's doesn't need my cents, but they are well deserving of five stars and a few dollars.   I am not a huge Yelper. Okay scratch that. I am a huge Yelper but not a very good one.  I love looking at the events and use it to gage the places I venture to, but you will never find me on a forum and rarely writing a review. I decided that Hula's was worth that rare occasion.   Like I said I am a fan of the Events page so I decided to try out Yesterday's Urban Wine Walk. I'll admit that the walk turned out to be a bust for my friend and I (for reasons of timing not event qualms) but Hula's was the best part and made the walk attempt worthwhile. The wine was great and our friendly server was more than willing to describe the options and chat about a great place to find a good Malbec. Thanks for the tip. My favorite wine was the Carmenere they were offering. My friend was a fan of the Fume Blanc.  The only thing we had time for was a starter and we went with the spicy Thai fish cakes, which were amazing. Perfect size and flavor and presented as if it was the after shot for a cooking demo. I have been wanting to try Hula's since they opened and I am willing to admit that the walk was my excuse to get down there. Now I know there is no excuse needed and I will definitely be heading back down for a full dining experience very soon. I suggest you do the same.",

We ordered two drinks that were both fruity and delicious, 1 of which came in an adorable tiki shaped glass.

    "text": "Watch out, Downtown. Because Uptown's coming after you.  THE LOCATION ---------------------- Situated in a revamped geometric building dating back to 1965 (ancient time in Phoenix-speak) within the same Central Ave shopping center as Lola Coffee and Haus, directly facing the St. Francis Xavier Church basilica. Camelback/Central is the closest light rail stop.  When you first walk in, you'll notice the patio: a collection of tables and a long bar tabletop placed around a firepit. I immediately knew that this was going to be a regular evening hangout for the uptown crowd. Tonight's temperature was perfect to be outside and as it cools down further, the firepit will be even more attractive.  Inside, the main dining room had shelves lined with kitschy tiki heads overlooking the otherwise regular dining area. The bar area is much cooler, though. First off, that giant hexagonal window is awesome and I think everyone should have one in their house. I'm glad they respected the original design by keeping it. A long bar with hanging lights, as well as another long tabletop. Moving images projected high up on the inside wall, which would easily be visible while going down Central through the giant window.  MENU --------- A limited menu today, with plans to expand it soon. A lot of Hawaiian-inspired dishes, with fish understandably being a highlight. I decided to try their island style poke (ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, green onions, and macadamia nuts - $9) and their cocojoe chicken plate (coconut encrusted chicken breast, lilikoi sauce, plantains, black beans, and rice - $15).   Full bar with a drink menu including a dozen plus typical tiki bar specials, including a 2-4 person Volcano Bowl. I decided to stay dry today (it's only Monday) so I'll have to imbibe some other time.  FOOD -------- The poke - 3.3 stars. The cut and quality of the fish was nice and went down easily, and the ingredients of soy, sesame, and green onions were all there, but somehow I was a little underwhelmed by it, which was strange, since I'm a big fan of poke. Nice chunks of avocado, although the macadamia nuts were missing.  The chicken plate - 3.3 stars - The coconut-encrusted chicken breast, cut into long strips, was really nice. Cooked tender and not in the least dry. It was the highlight and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My server had warned me upon ordering that the lilikoi sauce (basically a jazzed up passionfruit puree) was REALLY sweet so instead of having the chicken smothered with it, to have it on the side. And I'm sure glad I took her advice, because it was way too sweet for my taste. I asked her if they had any other sauces that I could try and she immediately brought three others over - a mango salsa, a peanut sauce, and an ahi glaze. The latter two didn't do much for me, but the mango salsa  had the perfect amount of sweetness and complemented the chicken much better. The rice & beans were cooked jerk style and were decent, although the plantains were missing at the outset. When they came a few minutes later, they had nice warm caramelization on the outside, but unfortunately were really cold when I bit into them, as if they hadn't finished defrosting when they were fried.  As for dessert, no space in my belly for key lime pie. Next time.  SERVICE ------------- I had the pleasure of meeting Dana, the owner. Really friendly and excited about opening up in this uptown location. He was very appreciative of my business and looking forward to integrating the restaurant into the local scene. My server was also very friendly, jovial and attentive. No complaints at all in this department.   RANDOM INTANGIBLES ---------------------------------- Music went from 80s to chillout lounge to rock. I just remember hearing \"She Drives Me Crazy.\" You can't go wrong with Fine Young Cannibals. It's True.  The view from the patio is great, in its uptown way. Of course you have the light rail going in either direction, while the M&I Bank building emanates its capitalistic glow from up the street. I looked up at Landmark Tower and saw the silhouette of someone dancing on their balcony. Must be a fan of FYC (as well as having the Bionic Woman's hearing powers).   FINAL VERDICT ---------------------- Seems like uptown is giving downtown a run for its money with all the openings in the past 18 months, and Hula's Modern Tiki is another welcome addition. The location is great, and I could see it having a an awesome happy hour (don't know if they're planning one), with folks hanging on the patio in the non-summer months.  Now the food may need some tweaking to be truly stellar, but to be fair, it was Day 1. There were definitely some bright spots and I'll come back to try more (the great service and friendly atmosphere didn't hurt).   So, all in all, food + service + overall impression on its first day = 3.6 stars, rounding up to 4. As they say, onwards & upwards.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQ7jG8EWr6&s=08a44cb7c47cd488b5b326e6a56ae9effddabdb3b94af27f5c300707a9905eca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Q7jG...</a>",

Other than that, the service was mediocre, the ginger in the cole slaw created  a bitter flavor, the sticky rice was not hot and had an added spice that none of us could name, and my pulled pork plate was just plain awful. The meat was smelly and tasted musty. I'll let our other guests describe their own dishes. As for Tracy D, we are NOT snowbirds, rather we have lived here for over 40 years...raised here, and own & run businesses here. We all dine out frequently! I think your comments to Patti S were pretty rude. A review of a restaurant is NOT a personal attack. Yelp was created for us ALL to voice our opinons. A bad dining experience happens.

I've been watching the renovations of this building for a while now and read the blog of all the fantastic things they have done inside the place, so I was waiting at the door 10 minutes before they opened.  Needless to say, I was pumped to finally eat here.  We were welcomed in a little bit before open time by Dana, the owner, who is a really awesome guy and his enthusiasm and excitement is truly infectious.  You can tell that this is his baby and he is so proud.  We were given menus which are minimized for the time being, but there are still a ton of stellar selections on there.  For a starter we chose the sweet potato fries and they were excellent.  They were not too sweet and had a fantastic texture.  Crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside made for a pretty addictive pre meal snack.  Next up was the ceviche, which was actually brought out complimentary by the chef.  I've never had ceviche before, but if this is what it all tastes like, I love it!  The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit.  My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious!  There were two huge, flattened pieces of chicken totally covered and crusted in coconut.  It was also slightly covered in a deliciously spicy and slightly sweet lilikoi sauce.  I loved it, but my husband loved it more, so I let him have it and I traded him.  Now I had the pork plate which was also delicious.  The pork was tender and the pineapple/soy bbq type sauce was addictive!  There were also chunks of pineapple which was a nice addition.  The coleslaw it came with was actually a great stand-alone side.  It had a tangy buttermilk base with just the right amount of pepper.  For dessert we got the key lime pie.  It was amazing.  It was so tangy, smooth, and creamy.  It was simply unbelievable, and unlike any key lime pie you have ever had.  I adore this place.  I'm truly in love.  I will be back here many many times.  I cannot wait till the weather is perfect for relaxing on the patio and sitting around the really cool firepit.  Obviously, I was impressed with this place.  The architecture and reuse of the building is wonderful.  The laid back/island atmosphere of this restaurant is a True winner that will be bringing in the people for a very long time.",

Was told multiple times that I needed to come here and finally did. Had the pork sandwich on the brunch menu and it was really good.  The only problem I had with the place was our server was just a little weird, not rude or anything, she just would comment on things that she thought we were looking at on the menu and just kept walking by with her input, but not a big deal. And then not like this place could help it but I was really bothered by the other patrons there, the tables are close so I guess you can hear other people more than you would want to but some of these people were just real stuck up. Being at a trendy place doesn't make you super cool, so just chilax and have a good time or go home. But yeah, not like they could do anything about it, but if your thinking about going and your a snooty brat, just don't.",

    "text": "I had dinner here with some friends a couple of weeks ago.  As appetizers, we ordered a half and half order of sweet potato and house cut fries, crispy coconut shrimp rolls, spicy edamame and crispy fish bites.  All of the appetizers were quite tasty.  The spicy edamame is definitely spicy - leaves your lips burning a bit - but they were oh so good.  I loved the pineapple horseradish sauce with the shrimp rolls - great pineapple flavor.    For dinner, I had the blackened wasabi Hapu - lightly blackened over wasabi mashed potatoes with seasonal veggies.  The flavor on the fish was good as were the potatoes but I'd like to have a little more kick for the potatoes - just a little more wasabi flavor.    We also had dessert - coconut cream pie.  You definitely want to save room for this.  It was very creamy - very rich - very delicious.  I believe Bailey was our server that night - absolutely wonderful - provided us with a lot of laughs and great service!",

I went there and was not impressed in the slightest on my first visit over two years ago now. The service was not the business and the food was not what I expected at all.   Today I am most definitely humming a different tune...  Now that I know what the menus has to offer and I have a better feel for the happy hours and specials and have been here about a dozen times... I am a fan! I have had breakfast and dinner enough times to try several things on the menu and have had most of the cocktails. I love the Kona beers they keep on draft and the atmosphere is shakin! The staff is fun and friendly and always accommodating.   Hula's you have a patron from here on out!",

Our group consisted of a bunch of friends from high school and we had the beef sticks and shrimp rolls (I think that's what they're called) and the were outstanding appetizers.   The Blackened Wasabi Mahi with wasabi mashed potatoes and greens was very good. The wasabi will do its usual dance with your palette, but it is not so overburdening on the taste buds that it turns you off. It is quite the opposite. As a side dish, the fried plantains are just the right counter to the fish. It really complements and balances the meal.   For dessert, the Key Lime pie and the Coconut Cream pie will make you wish you could buy each whole pie. I thought the Coconut Cream pie was probably the best I've ever tasted.  The only dish that needs to be on the menu is Spam Fried Rice, a staple in Hawaii.",

I loved the cool hair color.  When I want a larger meal I order the pulled pork sandwich, which is never a disappointment.  If you haven't tried Hulas, you have missed a good time.

We found a nice shaded table in the corner and it wasn't long until someone came by with waters for us and a dog bowl with water and ice for my Australian kelpie and my friend's long haired chihuahua. Awesome!   Once we had chilled with some $2 mimosas, we ordered lunch. Holy cow, that Hula burger with cheddar was just what I needed after a long morning of playing with my pup. My friend got the side mac and cheese as her meal and was very surprised. As an avid mac and cheese girl, she said it was comparable to the one at The Capital Grille (without the lobster, obviously). Deeelish! Husband also enjoyed his Hula burger with side of mac and cheese, but mostly his Dr. Funk, despite the ladylike color. Looking at their weekday happy hour menu, I wouldn't mind coming back just for a drink and a basket of their crispy sweet potato fries.",

The place is cute and the patio is really very pleasant.    I ordered a Zombie and a Painkiller cocktail (don't judge, I was rocking a migraine and desperately needed relief), and each one was nice and potent.  My husband just had iced tea.    I searched the menu for something with shrimp in it, but I was seriously left wanting in that department.  Instead I ordered a starter of lobster bisque and another starter of tuna ceviche.  The soup was hot and quite flavorful, but I would have liked a few more pieces of lobster meat.  The ceviche was extremely good and was served with flash fried wonton 'chips'.  I really liked it and my only criticism was that it was the lime juice was overpoweringly tangy and it could have benefitted from some avocado chunks to help cut down the tang a little bit.  My husband had the black bean burger which he said was really, really delicious.  All in all it was a good visit, and aside from our server not refilling our drinks in a very timely manner it was a good dinner out and I expect we'll be back.",

Birthday brunch on the patio - pineapple mimosa (they also offer OJ or cranberry versions during weekend brunch) & a painkiller (rum, coconut, pineapple & oj) were a great start.  He ordered the Loco Moco - raved it was the best he's had away from the Big Island.  Visually, it was the most appetizing I've seen served in the last couple of years.  I went with some smaller plates as there was so much I wanted to sample.  We had the Hawaiian ceviche (\"fresh white fish, \"cooked\" in citrus juice, coconut milk, chili, cilantro, garlic, wonton chips\") to start and it was delicious.   I ordered a side of spam and crispy coconut rolls - both were great.  There were lots more items we want to try so we will be back.  Service was great, hostess sat us right away (sunny patio, great for hanging out), and food came up quickly.  We made it a point to talk to the MOD to let them know we are now two huge fans.",

We normally go for brunch specials or weekly happy hour all day special. Makes it worth it for us. They seem to always have new waitresses who tend to make the experience inconsistent.

As if Spouse and I aren't alcoholics enough, you have to go and open one of the funnest (that's right, I say funnest) restaurants in Central Phoenix, fill the menu with phenomenal island drinks, and plop the whole thing within stumbling distance of our home. Our livers are on you, buddy.  It takes a lot to impress a professional boozer (that's a lie, but let's move on). That Mai Tai I had last night tasted better than the ones I had in Hawaii. And can I just say how refreshing it is to finally get some fruity options (because I am a huge fruit) rather than the same ol' margarita and martini variations served at every other restaurant in town. Not that I don't live for margaritas and martinis. Let's be honest, I'd drink mouthwash if the bartender poured it in a glass, mixed it with grenadine, and served it to me.  Where was I?  Oh, there's food too. Loved the sweet potato fries. Loved the Hula burger with sauteed onions. Loved, loved, loved Spouse's coconut chicken thingie. I am so ordering that next time because he refused to share. So stingy. BTW, I love that they have a Pupus menu (that's Hawaiian for appetizers) because I am a child (teehee, I said Pupus).  Speaking of next time, we're going back this weekend. Bringing a bunch of friends to hang with on Hula's groovy new patio. And I'm ordering about 17 more Mai Tais. If Hula's could go ahead and place an AA phone number on the drink menu, I'd appreciate it.",

    "text": "We visited Hula's last night with our Dinner Club...and the 13 of us gave it an awesome review.  The service was excellent, the drinks were delicious (HH all day on Saturday until 7...drink specials only), and everyone was very happy with their food.    From what I tasted my faves were the Blood Orange Martini, the coconut shrimp rolls, the poke, the wasabi fish, the korean beef short ribs, and mac 'n cheese.  I liked the vibe...casual & interesting...old school Hawaii Five-O on the wall, classic 80's music playing, garage doors open to the patio, and the huge hexagonal window.  Would love to come back and hang next to the fire pit when it's a little warmer out.  Totally recommended!!",

    "text": "We have some new friends who have never ridden the light rail.  The 4 of us decided to take a trip downtown and pick a restaurant that was an easy walk and one the we could enjoy for less than $50 a couple with a few drinks.  After doing the required internet searches we ended up at Hula's Modern Tiki on a Friday night in July.  We arrived around 6:30 and wanted to eat inside (they have a cute outdoor patio) as it was still a hot.  We were the first ones on the waiting list and created a seat at the bar.  Cute place filled with Hawaii type memorabilia.  My wife's Mai Tai was very good which can be a challenge to find in Phoenix.  We were seat in about 15 minutes.  The wait staff was adequate.  The spicy edamami was actually spicy and I ended up eating most of it.  We ordered the Ahi Taco's and the Carne Asada Taco's.  Each were two large taco's stuff with Ahi tuna and steak cooked to order.  There was enough for 3 or 4 taco's each.  Delicious.  My wife enjoyed the black bean and rice combination and she doesn't do beans.    The concrete floors make the atmosphere a little noisy but not obnoxiously so.  The 4 us were able to carry on a \"real conversation\".  I also notice a manager type \"floating around\" obviously paying attention to the details.  It showed.  I later introduced myself to the manager (Dana) who turned out to be the owner.  I always enjoy a restaurant where the owner/manager is actively involved.  The price came in right at $40  and we all agreed we would go back again.  It would be a really fun place on the patio when the weather cools.",

He knows he's in the hospitality business and that his primary goal is to take care his guests. He's attentive, helpful, happy, and he genuinely appreciates your patronage. Kudos to the owners for recognizing his talents and moving him up the ranks.",

We sat, we ordered, and we waited, waited, waited for the food.  It was a long while before our food came out.  We did not see what the food looked like.  It was so dark out.  The food was alright, but nothing that will make me drive out to eat there on purpose.    The server was very friendly!  The hostess was a little rude.",

    "text": "I really loved Hula's.  Decor: I think it was an old garage or fire department prior to being opened as an upscale tiki joint.  Despite being a 'modern' tiki joint, I love that they have big-screen plasmas and projection TVs playing 1950s and 1960s movies, like Jack Rabbit Slim's from \"Pulp Fiction\".  Underneath the bar is a very large and impressive collection of vintage tiki mugs.  Lots of framed posters of 1960s surf movies.    The food was pretty good.  The drinks even better.  Hula's mai tais go down smooth and, due to the typical Phoenix heat, it's easy to get two or three.  They managed to do a really good job of mixing the upscale with the vintage tiki stuff.   Hula's is the best tiki joint in the Phoenix area!",

Everyone knows the restaurant menu up and down. I always enjoy having a late lunch out on the deck. I wish there was a valet service to park the Phantom, as there is very limited parking available due to it being downtown. I don't recall the exact menu name item; however, if you're looking for a petite desert I would definitely recommend what I believe is the tilapia tiramisu. It's the perfect blend of protein and a savory desert. Overall it's a very vibrant atmosphere and I would recommend anyone looking for quality food and service. MMG",

    "text": "So full disclosure. My good friend and biz partner in NYC went to school with one of the owners of Hula's. I was in Phoenix this past week and ended up going to Hula's on Thursday evening, and I sat with a few locals that were new regulars to Hula's and they were talking about Yelp. I have known about Yelp, but had not been on until tonight. I thought it would be a good start to write a review of my experience at Hula's. FIrst off I have to hand it to anyone that has the guts to open a new business in a bad economy and a full blown recession. I am in the banking industry and I can tell you things are not getting any easier. Especially opening a biz in a place as devastated as Phoenix. Hats off to them for that. Place is beautiful, very hip, hip enough to be considered hip in NYC,and thats saying something. Had a good crowd, I would say whatever urbanites exist in Phoenix, they are going to Hula's. Very eclectic crowd. Young, old, gay, straight, families. All seemed very comfortable sharing the space, which is what I look for in a place that I would frequent.  community being very important to me. Nice to feel and see that vibe in a city that seems to struggle for identity. The many trips over the years that I have taken to Phoenix on business, I have noticed a big change happening in the past year in the central and downtown corridor. The light rrail being a big part of that. Speaking of light rail, very cool to be sipping on a great Mai Tai, sitting with good friends, having a fantastic burger( as good as I have had), and watching a fast moving train go rushing by a huge hexagon window. Hexagon, Octagon? Anyway, I walked around, and to my eyes they did not miss a detail. Very well thought out. I would say they need some landscaping in the front, and I was told that is in the works.  The staff seemed very happy to be there, no bullsh#&t delivery, came off very real and very willing to please. Cute staff always helps, and they have a bunch of cuties, with no attitude, just lots of warmth.   The drinks were a hit with everyone. Saw this huge bowl with a flame in the middle of it go by, that looked dangerous on many levels. BEsides my burger, I tasted their calamari and the poke, both I thought were fantastic. Fist time I had poke, will be looking for it back in NYC. Liked the varied menu, a touch of island lifestyle around the world. Good idea and original.  All in all, I would have to say that I compare restaurants wherever I go to the ones in NYC, and then rate them on if they could not only make it in NYC, but could thrive there. Hula's in the right location, and the modern mid century meets tiki 60's, Palm Springs decor, not the ticky tacky decor I was expecting, could thrive in the right neighborhood. West or east village, or Tribeca, or Brooklyn.  Maybe I will talk them into coming this way next. All in all a no brainer, and a must if your into a really well designed, well run neighborhood restaurant, with really good food and cocktails at very reasonable pricing.",
