As someone who tends bar, I can understand if you are busy (which they were slow enough to goof off together and with the customers) but at least acknowledge my presence before I've been sitting there for 10 minutes without even someone saying that they will be there to help me.  Got up and went to Calico Jacks next door and the service was fantastic.",

Went to Yelp to check out some restaurants and decided to give Whiskey Rose Bar & Grill a try based on the reviews and I liked their name!   Sure glad that we did.  We were seated right away, server came over immediately and took our drink and appetizer order.  She came back a couple times to take our food order but we were too busy chatting and hadn't looked at the menu.  Not a problem, she was very nice about it.   Finally ordered our food and it was very very good.  Large portions that most of us ended up taking home.  You will not go away hungry from this place.  BBQ was excellent and falling off the bone. Had a nice experience at Whiskey Rose and if I am ever on that side of town again we will be dining there.",

Just wish I could wash my hands in the men's room without an attendant.  Not sure why but I'm not s fan of that.  Try the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter beer in the mason jar!",

A friend and I came here before a concert mainly because the options of places to eat at westgate are limited and this one had a check in special (can't argue with a check in special, right?). The service was a little slow, especially for how few customers were in the restaurant. When we were attended to, our waitress was nice and helped us decide on drinks and food. We each got a cocktail, which are pricey for this kind of establishment at 10$ each. The cocktails were overly sweet, but not terrible. The best part was the check in special (order an entree, get a free app). We ordered their burger that has pulled pork on top and got their nachos with brisket ( I think) and bbq sauce for free (a 14 or 15$ value....sweet!). The nachos came out and we knew we were in trouble. The plate of nachos was bigger than my head....it was insane! The nachos were fairly tasty, but the burger was a disaster. The thing was too tall to bite and too wet for its bun (read: bun disintegrated into a wet nothing). I would not recommend that burger. I would recommend their nachos.... the plate is a steal, especially if you get it for free....but maybe invite 3 or 4 friends to help you eat it all.",

We ordered nachos as an appetizer with brisket, they were out of brisket. Had to get chicken which were cubed pieces. Shredded chicken would have been better to stick to the chips. For dinner, someone ordered rib tips and they were out. How can that happen  a concert  50 yards away was scheduled months before. Service was good. Husband had bbq chicken breast which he said was good. Sister had BLT, sandwich was packed with loads of bacon, she got onion rings which had no taste. I had bbq pork sandwich. Tender, but couldn't taste bbq and the coleslaw on top was also lacking. Side of fries were tasty and plentiful. We really enjoyed the nachos. They would have been over the top had the restaurant not run out of beef. Not worth a return.",

I got a spiked palmer ..(very strong drinks here! yay!) Very nice and friendly waitress who answered all of our questions being out of towners, and new to this restaurant. she was awesome! great service and tons of TVs for sports fans. Great bar area, and awesome drink menu. the fried mac and cheese appetizer is amazing, must try. seating outside on the patio too.",

Food was OK. I don't recommend the \"rib tips\" - mostly fat & bone with minimal meat. Pulled pork was pretty good. The \"corn bread basket\" for $6 was 4 small corn muffins with 2 containers honey butter - kind of disappointing. The acoustics in Whiskey Rose are awful - impossible to enjoy your meal or have a conversation if there is a group of 8 guys at the table across the room.",

The food was average at best - steak with little flavor and potatoes (baked and au gratin) were undercooked.  The service was just ok also - good when the waiter showed up at the table, but that was a rare occurrence.  It seemed management was trying to save money as there were not near enough staff to adequately run a restaurant.  One member of our party had an alcoholic beverage that was empty less than half way through the meal, and he was never asked if he wanted another.",

Finally tried something new and the BBQ grilled chicken wrap was an excellent choice. It was packed full of chicken and a variety of other tasty ingredients and was gigantic. The mac and cheese side was still solid and of course the burgers continue to be excellent. Those steak fries are worth ordering as a side as well. We also got a free appetizer by checking in on Yelp and the avocado egg rolls are quite a treat. Lots of cream cheese laced with avocado and scallions. The staff is always friendly and the managers always walk around to check on your food. See you again soon.",

Trying to separate that out from the food... I mean they try. I think they are good people.  I'm just not sure what to say. So I guess in fairness, the food was alright, could have been better, and the service, for most people, would probably be fine.   Um, for me, it made me sad. You know, I guess people have their rights? I honestly don't know what review to give so I guess I'll try a median review:  I think they are good people, but man.. would I go back as a regular dude who happens to be gay, ... no, I would not. So as reviews are meant to guide most people, and most are not gay, I guess I should give them a somewhat higher rating, and I had done that.  You can definitely go here and have a good time, depending, I think, on who you are...   So shit what do I say? Um for me it was 1, for most people, probably a 3.5?",

Bartender did not offer suggestions or alternatives.instead left a glass of water and walked away after taking food order. Ribs served with two napkins, no one came around to check and see if order was delivered correctly, it was not. Had to flag someone down to pay. And then adjust the bill because it was wrong. Overcharged. Not sure if the server's name on the receipt was the correct one but Casey G needs to be bumped back down to dishwasher status and put in the back of the house before he costs your company any more money or his co-workers anymore lost tips. Four others were going to meet us there and we promptly texted them and advised them to meet us elsewhere after witnessing this sad display of bartending and service. The bar across the street was happy to cash out our party of 6's $400+ tab and collect their $100+ tip. Get this douchebag out from behind your bar before he tanks your entire business.",

We ordered the queso as an appetizer which was decent besides the completely burnt chips. I asked for the caprese turkey burger but just asked to sub the turkey burger for beef. Remind me to never try to change something again!!! The caprese burger originally had a patty, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, onions, spinach, balsamic glaze and pesto mayo. I got my burger and although it had the beef patty, it only had some cheese and lettuce on it.... nothing else. No sauce either. So I asked nicely again for the pesto mayo and for the balsamic. She proceeded to come back and give me barbecue sauce. I had given up at this point. My boyfriends sweet potato fries were practically raw and honestly we will never be returning here! Bad decision and many regrets.",

Asked for a beer and explained once again we were in no rush. Decided to order our food after the fifth time being asked within a 10 min time. After receiving our food the server never came back. After even finishing our meal she never asked if I care for another beer or how our meal was. After flagging her down still sitting now with an empty table because I personally bussed our table and removed all dishes to a table adjacent to us she then asked if we were done. My wife noticed the entire time we was talking with the other staff doing side work and on her phone.  All in all I feel that we would never come here again due to the poor service.

Despite this I hung out, just to keep my friend company. Then one WATER later, I was approached by another \"bouncer\" and told I was over intoxicated and needed to leave. I said he didn't know what he was talking about and he said \" sorry you can't hold your booze faggot, next time go to a faggot bar.\" I was deeply disturbed by this level of ignorance and unprofessionalism.

My only concern is as a Coyotes season ticket holder I was given a Westgate VIP card that Whiskey Rose participates in and I am suppose to get 20% off but every bartender and/or server I have shown this card to is dumbfounded or says is ti not good on game nights.  Well, I do not go Westgate unless for a Coyotes game or concert....",

I am surprised myself to say 'but' but there are so many times where you hit up a place that is a touristy spot on off hours only to be treated like you are invading their space. Not so for us. Our server was friendly, attentive, and very kind considering we also had the 2.5 year old in tow who just wanted to shake his booty on the dance floor. The music was fun, the food was tasty, and again, the staff was very friendly.  I look forward to making Whiskey Rose a part of my repertoire when visiting Westgate!",

Very attentive; we never felt like we were waiting for her to get a drink refill or ask a question, she would pop by on good time to see if we needed anything. Sweet tea was real good and served in mason jars! Started with the jalapenos or 'torpedoes' which were roasted just right to where you still get a crunch, with just the right amount of cheese and wrapped in a thick slice of bacon. BOMB. Didn't like the dipping sauce; tasted like Big Mac sauce. I ordered the Santa Fe Mac N Cheese and hubby ordered the half chicken with Fries. The Mac came with BBQ pulled pork on top with green chile. Would of enjoyed more heat out of the chilies but I know they're out of season. Still, I enjoyed the dish a lot. Hubby's chicken was REAL good! They cook/roast it with a dry rub on the skin and give you a tangy BBQ sauce to put on it if u like. He would alternate just eating the chicken with the dry rub vs. dipping it in the sauce. Did I mention how much we enjoyed the music?! Loved the playlist! Start to finish we were sat and signing the check in 30-35 min. I don't mind the no beers on tap. So long as they keep the KCCO!",

Even after that, she still didn't ask what I wanted, one of the other girls finally took care of me. Bad service and poor drinks. There are better places in Westgate to spend your money",

They always have a smile and make you laugh and make a bad or stressful day better!  They truly no how to have fun and make you have a great time! I came in once and now it's my regular home 2-4 nights a week to watch the games on the many tv's and for dinner and drinks! Live music on Friday and Saturday nights are great!

The whole point of appetizers is that they come out first, so I said we want the Ahi first. By the way, the Ahi is expensive an you only get a few slivers of it. Not a great value. And then we're waiting FOREVER for our entrees to come out. I finally asked the waitress \"Is our food coming out any time soon?\" It was like 12:30, they weren't busy at all. And she's like \"Oh I put a hold on your food since you said you wanted the appetizer first. Oops! My bad.\" Like she didn't even care that she delayed our food that much. She was totally the self-absorbed \"Look at me I'm so cute\" kind of person. I think her name was Lauren. I never said I wanted a hold on my food, I just said bring the app first because that's the whole point of an appetizer. Even if the food came out 5 minutes after the appetizer, that would've been fine because it doesn't take long to eat a few slivers of ahi. I never asked for a hold, and I was annoyed that she did that. Our food took a lot longer than it needed to, and she didn't seem to care of be apologetic at all. I wouldn't go back here again.",

I was very disappointed they did not serve draft beer so we got bottled beer. My guy ordered wings and I got the mushroom swiss burger. The food did not take long to come out and our waitress was really attentive (reason for the one star). The food: Wings came out on this huge plate making it look like a super small snack. My burger and fries looked like heaven. All though I cannot say that was how it tasted. Oh those looks were so deceiving. I thought \"Can one really mess up a mushroom swiss? I think not!!\"  I think my hopes were a tad too high this night because I was so hungry. There was absolutely no seasoning on my burger. None. Not even a little bit. I am not a big complainer of food but even after putting my own salt on the burger it did not help at all. I had my guy try it out just in case I was being a little on the crazy side as I do from time to time. He agreed, it was s***. I was so disappointed. So disappointed that I Yelped this! Oh man I can't believe it came down to this.   I would not return to this place just because the whole experience was very mediocre and I have a other places that I would rather spend money on.",

When she brought me a plate of pulled pork meat, I realized I made the mistake of not saying I wanted the sandwich, which I personally think I would specify if I was the waitress, but I apologize and ask for a bun. She proceeds to charge me two more dollars for the sandwich when I don't even have all the other toppings that come with it.  Now when I go to taste my pulled pork, it's cold. Completely cold around the outside so I have to send it back. Upon eating it it was pretty good. The waitress brings is our check not bothering to wait and see of we need anything.  After leaving, not even twenty minutes later my stomach was severely upset. I had to take pepto twice to stop the pain.  Biggest mistake and waste of money.

The chicken was just okay, the breading all fell off & the gravy was nice but I was so bummed to see fries really meant chips, they were good but not was I was expecting. I didn't love the macaroni either. The corn nuggets from my husbands sampler were amazing! We would definitely come back for drinks & appetizers but will probably pass on entrees.",

The mac and cheese was cold and looked like it was sitting out all day. The mashed potatoes tasted like something you'd get out of a box at the grocery store. When I said something to the waitress she said \"well you got half off anyways with the Groupon.\" That's not the point as far as I'm concerned. If I'm disappointed and I got half off, can you imagine how someone who paid full tilt would feel? The food is only worth half of what they charge, I'd never go there and pay full price, it's just not worth it. There's so many other restaurants to choose from.",

They put us at a high table which is o.k. but when the stools are wobbling just like the table your butt will start to slide off. It took the person taking out order about 5 mins to ask if we wanted drinks.  Then she came back empty-handed and asked if we were ready to order. Both my husband and I have gastric sleeves and dont eat a lot because of this. We decided to share our meal, 5 minutes after our food came out our server finally checked on us and ask if we needed anything. I asked for stuff for our chicken and she actually came back to give it to us with in two minutes. Then she left for 10 minutes and yes, know it was 10 minutes because was timing on my phone. She came and dropped off the check and while this whole evening was progressing really did not focus on use, but was sure fixated on other tables. I get it, cheapskates sharing and not getting any drinks but there is a reason for it people should not assume. Like i am doing also but I just want her to know our reasoning and not everyone will come eating big meals. Yes, we left her a good tip when we should not have.  We may not be normal customers but believe I should not have to explain why we are sharing. Give me the attention you give and gave other tables.",

The fries were battered and oily. I was disappointed with the chili mac. I thought it was going to be a thicker mac & cheese with some chili mixed in, but it was more like pasta with watery chili and a layer of cheese on top. It was heavy too. My stomach was none too pleased after all that grease... However, the servers were very nice & attentive and were happy to take pictures/video of our group as requested. Don't think I'd return on my own, but another happy hour would be alright.",

I felt like I received personalized service as soon as we sat down with a huge crowd around us. We ordered some drinks and wings and had a great time before the game, will definitely return.",

    "text": "Came here the Sunday night before President's Day looking to party hard, and only Whiskey Rose could deliver. It's very minimalistic with the decorations, staff wasn't a bunch of jerks (like they would be at almost any other bar in this plaza), and people love to have a good time. Here's everything I like:  -Amazing karaoke. I had to turn around and second guess that a real person was singing Miranda Lambert, and it was not just a recording. We're talking talent that's almost an American Idol level. Wow. They didn't just do country...some guy was screaming into the mic on an emo track and patrons thought it was groovy. I like. I like a lot.   -Hard liquor. Hard liquor everywhere. This is the kind of place where manly men can show off and shoot \"moonshine\" all night. It didn't even break the bank. 3 beers and a Jack & Coke was less than $20 before tip.  -Space. Lots and lots of space to sit or stand. Patio was tiny, but if you need fresh air, it's not like it's far out of your way.   Not to say this place was perfect. This is the only bar in Westgate that does not carry beers on tap. Whichever beers that have in stock is also not made clear, and you won't really be able to ask over the blaring music, so just get a Budweiser or something. And finally, they were pretty gosh darn slow, as if the workers still didn't know where everything was. Is it that new? In any case, I had a good time and would love bringing back some friends. The competition to other country-influenced bars is very welcome.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here before setting out in Westgate for the evening.  We were immediately seated and were served by a fantastic female who took awesome care of us all night.  We ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and holy moley, they were enormous!  She and I could have happily shared this as our entree and called it good but we ordered BBQ as well.  We ate only half of the nachos before the biggest plates of food I've seen in a long time arrived at our table.  I had the pulled pork platter with cole slaw and mac and cheese and she had the rib tips with the same two sides.  It was absolutely delicious!  The only item I wasn't totally thrilled about was the mac n cheese, but that's only because I prefer Southern style mac (firm and can be cut into cake-like pieces).  Theirs is creamy.  It was good, but not my fave.  The cole slaw was awesome and the BBQ sauce that came with the pulled pork was sweet and smoky.  We were checked on by management twice while we ate and they were very kind and genuine.   ***TIP: If you check in, you get a free appetizer!  Our ridiculously huge and delicious nachos turned out to be free and we had no problem with redeeming the Yelp* coupon.   Service here is top notch.  The portions are ridiculous, and for the price you pay, I felt it was extremely reasonable.  Before we left, one of the managers gave us a couple of \"two for one\" drink coupons and invited us back later on in the evening.  He told us the restaurant became a bar/dance club in the evening and boy was he right.  This was the most packed bar in all of Westgate and we had an absolute blast!  We danced all night, met tons of really nice people, and definitely used those 2 for 1 coupons the manager gave us earlier.   My friend and I lived it here and we will definitely come back (for the food and the fun!).",

    "text": "We came here with our kids for dinner on Cinco de Mayo. They weren't too busy and seated us quickly near the back. Our server Was Lexi and she was super attentive and overall a great server. They had some drink specials including $2 Coronas so we ordered a couple of those. The food was delicious. My son ordered the Cowboy Nachos and they are huuuge! My other two ordered off the kids menu and loved their food. I ordered the fish tacos and at first glance I thought I would be disappointed as they served them on street taco tortillas. Hmm. But after two coronas they were probably just right. Flavor was surprisingly great but the fish itself a tad dry. My husband ordered the wings and ordered them extra crispy. They were delicious but oh wow were they spicy! Tyler (manager??) checked in us and asked how our experience was we told him great. He apologized for the loud noises behind us (employees took down some dining tables and set up a table for beer pong) we told him it was fine. It was nice of him to check on us.  So here is where they get docked a star...after the manager left our table we decided to order dessert after being asked by our waitress.  While we were waiting a young guy that worked there said \"By the looks of things it looks like you guys are just about done here. Just to let you know after 9 the kids aren't allowed to be in the restaurant.\" We said ok we hadn't been keeping track of the time. We replied when is 9 what time is it? and then fumbled for our phones to see what time it is. He replied \"you have 15 minutes.\" So when the dessert finally came I told my kids to hurry up and eat it because we had to go. We still needed our check. I feel like our server maybe should have informed us when we first ordered that after 9 it would be turned into a full on bar. As a paying customer I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out the door. I was a tad irritated because nowhere on there website does it say kids not allowed after 9. (Suggestion) As we were leaving one the employees had a huge stack of sombrero's and gave each of my kids one. Which was very sweet and kind of made up for being rushed out.  Overall great service, great food, good music and good drinks. Will probably be back in the future..without the kids.",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars I would. The manager approached me last night and began hitting on me. At first he acted like some random guy that was partying there and not the manager of the establishment. I was annoyed and told him to take a hike because he could clearly tell that I was there with my husband. When I rejected his advances he began escorting me out of the establishment and only then revealed that he was the manager. I asked him how refusing his advances were grounds for kicking me out and he began to get in my face. He told me that he could \"Ask me anything he wanted because he was the manager\". He poured both my beers out in front of me while looking me dead in the eyes. My husband then stepped in between because the manager was being very agressive and the manager had 3 bouncers jump him.  They threw him to the ground and put him into a choke hold, spraining his ankle in the process. The manager then ran and got the cops and made it look like my husband was being disorderly. He tried to have him arrested. I will be looking more into what I will be doing about the injuries incurred but just thought I would make everyone aware. I don't care who you are, you have no reason to speak to a woman like that or cause that sort of drama. He must be very insecure. We are visiting from Canada and we did not want any trouble. It definitely wasn't a great representation of the area.  Stay far away!",

Nobody turned it off and it would let out a terrifying squeal now and then the whole time.   When we arrived normal rock and country was playing at a reasonable level and then out of nowhere mind shattering awful sounds began pounding our brains until we got up and left...  I would have thought it was almost 3.5 stars if not for the music and nobody making the horror end!  The demographic seemed off for that music with more 40+ year old people than 25 and under....",

    "text": "We came to Whiskey Rose during Football pre-season! Wow that was a mistake..  There were no tables available inside, so we just sat outside. We didn't realize that it was so hot out!!  We ordered water and cowboy nachos to start. The cowboy nachos were free from the Yelp free appetizer. That saved us $13! Score.  It took our servers so long to get us water refills.. We were getting pretty dehydrated out there.  We ordered the ribeye, with mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes for $28. Along with a shock top beer that was surprising $10.. What beer cost $10?!  So total our bill was $43 plus tip, which makes it over $50.  In my opinion, that was not what we expected to pay.  The worst part about our experience was that there were speakers on the ceiling and it kept playing spurts of LOUD music that was literally blowing everyone's ear drums out. It wasn't like it was good music either. It was scratchy and just out of tune. Everyone's faces looked unpleasant.  I'll give this place a 3 stars for okay food, but not a 5 stars for comfort and satisfaction.",

Barely made it upstairs in time.   We went back to Whiskey Rose after the show. All the menus showed a Thursday special of $3 Jack drinks after 9pm. When complaining about the bill, they said they don't have that special anymore and pointed to a poster on the wall. A $6 tab was $15.  While still complaining that the menu pricing should be honored,  they called the manager over who was also the bouncer. There was no incident but what a scam.",

First off, we sat on the patio and it was extremely loud.  We like looking at everything around Westgate but this restaurant is more like a bar setting even though their food menu is huge.  So it's a pretty irritating setting for a meal with friends when you have to YELL at each other to talk.  Second my glass of wine was served in a mason jar.  Trashy.  Third I had purchased a groupon when we decided to go there, and I couldn't use it because it was an 'event day' (aka there was a hockey game) even though we ate our meal while the game was going so we clearly weren't there for that. I didn't even know there was a game, so you're telling me before we go out to eat I need to check and make sure there isn't anything going on?  We ended up paying a lot of money for mediocre food (and small portions).  The worst part is I have to go back to use my groupon or just eat the money.  I don't like returning to the same place twice if the food is just 'ok'.  Whiskey Rose isn't a place I'd like to go back to.",

With the DJ tempting me in with top 40 country music we walked through a field of cigarette smoke to a packed bar. Upon first look it seemed like an amiable enough place. After waiting for 10 min for a male bartender to take notice I practically jumped up and down on the bar next to the men he just served only for him to turn around and take a mans order on the other side of the bar.  After I got my drink they played maybe 2 more country songs then all top 40 dance music ala Jason Derulo. Not what I signed up for. I'm all for that music but I'm IN A COUNTRY BAR!   The only redeeming qualities is they have good drinks, albeit I drink whiskey on rocks.. Not much to screw up. Also they had an MMA fight on so that bodes well with me.  I don't know where they missed the mark. The ambiance is nice. Clean and well maintained and stylish. I think the biggest strike against it is the DJ and their idea of attracting a crowd is by exploiting women having them do blow job shots on command. Seriously I'd like to think women are more evolved than that. You are not attracting women (especially those who spend real money in bars/clubs) with these kinds of antics. And anyone who knows anything about running a bar knows that women are your core demographic. Get the women to your bar and men will follow.  So I say shame on you Whiskey Rose, you seem better than this and I think with a change in management you could exceed the business you do now.  Let me know when you get you shit together Whiskey Rose and we will talk. Until then so fucking long.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend went there last night for Whiskey Girl's Night... because it seemed promising in the advertisement. First off, I was one of 5 ladies in this bar... it was full of older gentlemen (which is fine...but I was expecting a more upbeat dancing kind of crowd and atmosphere).  The waitress was sweet but couldn't seem to hear us very well and wasn't very knowledgeable about shots/drinks.    This place is suffering from a serious identity crisis as well, the DJ was playing country, then rock, then footloose :P No one was dancing. If you are going to advertise a dance floor... play music that people can actually dance too... just saying.  Guys also had to pay a $5 cover to get in, which is laughable once you experience what you just paid for.   The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one is that the food was great. I got the Berry Salad with Salmon and it was pretty yummy.",

The DJ was very good and they were doing karaoke later in the night. There was a decent crowd for Sunday night the bartenders were so nice and I'm new to alcohol they whipped me up something nice and very tasty. I didn't get the lady's name but she had blonde hair and was the one helping me choose. And Travis was helping her they were very attentive to people. This was a very fun experience. I love this place! I don't understand why so many bad reviews?",

She took the other 4 adults' orders and then started to walk off so I stopped her and told her what I wanted. We ordered the saloon sampler and when we received it there was no corn. When we asked the guy who brought it out (not our waitress) he explained they didn't have anymore but they gave us more fried pickles to make up for it. Normally when a restaurant is out of something they tell you and let you decide what you want so I found this odd and didn't like it. My burger was also very undercooked and when I politely said something I was asked what temperature I had asked for and had to explain that I was never asked. Even after having them cook it more it still came back a little undercooked but I didn't complain. I assume the manger saw and she took it off the bill. My husband also had to ask for a new plate because his brisket was really dry but he did say they did a lot better on the second time around.   To end on a positive note the fried macaroni was really good.",

Food was slow coming out,but being as busy as they were I can understand. However, when it did come the onion rings were cold. Wrap was good and had some nice flavor. The server came around and asked us if everything was ok and I told her about the onion rings and she said she would swop them out. Never happened. When we finally asked for our check I told her that the onion rings were never replaced. She said sorry. Well, I'm sorry too because that's why places fail. Lame excuses like, sorry, only makes the customer frustrated and unwilling to frequent the establishment. You need to make things right and when the ball is dropped while attempting to make things right you really need to shine. In the case that didn't happen. Come back for drinks, maybe, food, NOPE....",

The inside is big and spacious, and they are going for a country feel (corporate country). They service drinks in big mason jars, which is a fun touch.  My husband got some brisket and liked his food a lot. It initially came out luke warm, but the kitchen fixed that as soon as we told our server. The service was very nice, if a little slow. The mac & cheese and cornbread sides were really yummy. A vegetarian could be very happy with a few servings of the mac & cheese, it's very cheesy and warm and satisfying.   They don't list beer prices out on the menu, which should be changed, but otherwise this is a good place to grab some drinks and food before a game.",

    "text": "First of all, I was there Sat. evening, 6/13 which was the evening of the Aerosmith concert.  All restaurants were packed & had wait times of an hour or more.  Whiskey Rose gave me a wait time of 40 mins, since I was alone.  I'm waiting outside & now when the wait time is pushing an hour, I'm starting to get annoyed as the arena will be opening the doors in 15 mins.  I went back to the desk, told the girls that you told me the wait time was going to be 40 mins, we're now at 1 hour.  Can you seat me or not?  I, also, said that if they can't seat me, please be up front about it, & I'll just go on to the arena, getting something to eat at one of the snack bars.  They told me they could seat me in a corner, I said fine that I simply want to get dinner at this point.  Now, on to my meal.  I ordered the beef brisket with sides of beans & cole slaw.  I got the lean brisket which might have been the problem.  When my plate was brought out, the brisket was cold, had some cold BBQ sauce drizzled over it.  The meat was very tough.  The sides were ok.  I know I should have brought this to my server's attention, under normal conditions I would have.  At this point, I simply wanted to eat what I could stand, pay my check, & get to the concert.  Service was adequate.  Place terribly noisy.  I paid $16 for pretty bad BBQ which might have been worth $6.  I live in Chandler, so seriously doubt that I will be going back here, again.  If I am in Glendale for a concert in the future, & want to get a meal, it most certainly will not be at WR.  I'll just get something to eat in my area before I start the drive to Glendale",

My cousin said his turkey burger was great. The server made sure to change the TV channel to the game we wanted to see. I gave only 4 stars because the server seemed very inexperienced and also got my husband's beer order wrong. We would go back when we want ribs again or want to watch a game in a sports bar.",

    "text": "I will be honest with you. I usually don't go to West Gate too often. Maybe once a year for a Cardinals game. Sunday was one of those days. I brought my son and his friend to the Cardinals game. Got to the stadium early so we can grab a bite at West Gate.   We decided to try Whiskey Rose. Before a Cardinals game every place is packed so WR was no different. This is a huge place. Eating outside and inside. We got an inside table and they have two room inside. One with the bar area then a back area. We got the back area. Lots of tv's with pro football on it. It was loud cause what do you expect from football fans.   So I ordered the Smokehouse Bacon burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Had to pay an extra buck for the fries. I thought that the burger was huge. Thick and juicy with a thick pieces of bacon. Bun was nice and soft. It was very filling but burger was okay. Not great. No wow factor but okay. Sweet potato fries were okay to. Seemed like they were really fresh and crispy. Good.   Since we checked in on Yelp, we got a free appetizer. My son picked the Fried Mac n Cheese. I was surprised that it came out in a ball but that's cool. Our waitress recommended ranch dressing with this. Said it really was good with it. So we got that too. It was really crispy on the outside with hot Mac n Cheese in the middle. Ranch really helped but the Mac n Cheese is Mac n Cheese. It was okay not great. Not bad but okay.   My son got the Saloon burger and he didn't complain. He ate it all gone. I can tell when he really likes something cause he raves about it after the first bite. Didn't hear anything from him. So I knew it was just okay and good. If it's not good then he won't eat it. So it must have been good.   The service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and even made small talk too. So that was great. She kept tabs on us and made sure our water glasses were refilled. Food came out in a timely manner even though it was really busy that day. So I would give out waitress a kudos. Great service.   The funny thing about this place is that it's a bbq and burger joint. Very casual. Very cowboy-ish type of place with a bar and football. So when we walk into the restroom they have a restroom attendant in there. He personally gives you soap to wash hands and paper towels to dry with. Also, he has a bunch of supplies to buy too. Thought this was a little strange for a bbq and burger joint but oh well.   I thought it was an okay meal. Very relaxing. No rushing us out the door or anything. Food is okay. Service is great and we're there for a football game so it's an football environment. Very cool. Will I be back. We'll see next year. Maybe",

    "text": "Whiskey Rose is my new favorite hang out at Westgate. It fills two items on my checklist which are: Good food and quick service. Plus it's literally steps away from the entrance to Gila River Arena.  There is more to Whiskey Rose though. It's got some character and they clearly support a variety of sports and teams, including the Coyotes. Plus there is a great patio for enjoying the weather in the fall. The downside is you're competing with the joints on either side who believe 'loud' equals 'atmosphere'.  The menu is still new to me, but I saw plenty I would like to try on my next visit, particularly the 1/2 lb. BLT. And even though there wasn't a lot of BBQ sauce on my grilled chicken sandwich, I could tell the sauce was pretty good. Plus, the jalapeno cornbread was amazing!  Because of the convenience, the above average menu and the great service provided by Kiley, I predict that me and my hockey ensemble will be frequenting Whiskey Rose in the near future.",

When we walked in no one was there to seat us so we stood around looking in circles for a while before a gentleman in a security shirt came to seat us. Once seated we were asked to move so they could set up beer pong. Once we moved it was a hefty length of time before our waitress came to greet us. We ordered two beers and sat there without a menu (and beer) for a good 10 minutes. After we finally got our menus and ordered, the wait for the food was even longer. We ended up not eating until almost 9:30. That being said, the service was horrible.  The food was up and down. I had the chicken fried chicken and then breading had a great crisp to it and was nice and moist. The gravy was good, nothing special but decent. The mashed potatoes were bland, yet way over seasoned with pepper. Side of veggies, also not cooked.  I would give it another try, maybe during different hours though.",

Another ten minutes goes by...we flag a manager, who goes to three different servers to convince one to wait on us (whatever happened to assigned sections???). We get waters, and finally order. FORTY minutes later still no food. Server goes to check on food and never comes back. We flag manager, he goes to kitchen, comes out and says they're making the order. No thanks, never again.

We had the worst luck this evening because every restaurant had over an hour wait.  When we arrived at Whiskey Rose we were seated within five minutes...a telltale sign of the restaurant.  There was a hockey game going on so the place was packed.  Here are the pro's and con's of our evening:  Pro:  - Seated almost immediately and were able to have two drinks during our hour and a half stay. - Waitress was nice but clueless about the liquor served at the bar and couldn't even make a salad.  Con's: - After an hour and a half of waiting we didn't even get our food.  We would have been late for our movie.  Apparently all hockey attendees got their food before us, our order was pushed to the back of the line. - Despite the name of the place, \"Whiskey Rose\", they serve NO whiskey - Bartender service is extremely slow. - I didn't even get the salad I ordered after 1.5 hours of waiting.  Seriously, the wait staff can't even make the salads for customers?  We were EXTREMELY disappointed with the service here.  Management needs to take a closer look at how the bartenders treat customers and how the food is sent out.  We ended up scarfing down popcorn for dinner at the movie theater. : (",

I really like the fact that they have a live band here on Saturday nights! This place was really Poppin one Saturday night when I stopped in with my husband. The band was awesome! The staff here are friendly and look super busy all the time.   I will be back soon! :)",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. Young male manager was very rude when asked about the yelp coupon. Ordered 1 drink came back and said they were out of an ingredient. Proceeded to order another and once again out of fresh strawberries. Mind you this is on a Sunday at 8pm. Ordered our food. It's was nothing special. Tasted like cafe food. Husband ordered the putine sandwich it was extremely disappointing. Super salty and mush. I ordered the Davi burger and it was literally a dry well done party with a bun. I ordered medium. Our waitress was nice however every time she asked how things were I would say okay. Not good just okay. She never asked how it could be better. Furthermore I was just disappointed and felt like my 50 bucks was a waste. Not to mention the staff was drinking on the job. The manager I mention earlier working Sunday night 3/5 at 8pm was drinking with some Buddies that were working. Very unprofessional.",

We came on game day, never was told after we were seated that the food would be over an hour to two wait - for 2 burgers!  We were overcharged for the drinks IMO, nothing comped after the server offered multiple times to have the manager visit with us - who never did! - so we paid our tab and left.  Unfortunately the server missed out on the tip - had the manager approached us in some way, we wouldn't have stiffed the server but the overpriced drinks were a disappointment to say the least and we wasted an hour and a half when we could have been at the Yard House actually getting served - and good food too! Will not return, not even for drinks.  For locals, this is a dump and waste of your time and money.  Tourists, have at it!  You must be what keeps their doors open.",

    "text": "First time to the Whiskey Rose, I was more than impressed. I was in town for the Penguins VS Coyotes game and was looking for a place to have a quick meal and some drinks prior to the game. After striking out at Yardhouse across the way, my boyfriend and I stumbled into this place. Quickly we found a spot at the bar and we were greeted by Nadia the bartender. She took our drink order right away and offered us a food menu. I noticed that offered a pulled pork poutine, so we ordered that and some fried pickles. When the food arrived it looked amazing, pickles were delicious but the pulled pork poutine was missing everything that made it poutine (fries, gravy, and cheese curds). I told the bartender and she quickly asked for the correct entree. A few mins later the bar manager came over to inform us they were out of gravy and offered us something else to eat. While I was a bit disappointed, it's hard to find poutine in my area, the entree that was originally brought looked amazing so we asked for that. It did not disappoint, I was a huge fan of the pulled pork and everything that came with it. I applaud the staff here at the Whiskey Rose for being efficient and personable! Keep it up, and I will for sure return when I am back in town!!!",

    "text": "We were in town for the Cardinal football game.  We left the hotel and walked to district a couple hours before kick off.  We found most of the restaurants packed, with up to a 45 minute wait at saddle ranch.    We took a gander at this place.  Checked yelp and saw only one review, it gave it one star.  With the main complaint being no draft beer.  Seemed a little strange, a bar without draft beer.  We went in anyway, were seated right away in the farthest corner of the place next to the kitchen door.  Lots of hustle and bustle about the place.  Cute waitresses, little shorts and cowboy boots.  Our waitress swings by among the traffic of other waitresses headed to the kitchen.  I order a Coors light in the bottle, while I study the menu.  It's a pretty standard BBQ joint menu, a burger with pulled pork on it catches my eye.  Looks interesting, so when the waitress returns with my beer I order it.  My friend orders the pulled pork sandwich.  I grab my beer and take a big pull off the bottle and I am met with hot beer.  Not room temp beer like in England, but hot beer.  My companion tells me that the mountains are not blue.  I get up and find the waitress and tell her.  The waitress took the beer back to the bar then returns with the same beer and a glass of ice.  She told us that the bar tenders had got the beer on ice late so all of their beer was warm.  She recommended that I pour the beer over ice.  I had to tell her that beer isn't like a mixed drink, you don't pour it over ice.  I then ordered a coke as our food arrived.   My dinner looked appealing enough, a good sized burger with a heap of onion rings.  My companions sandwich looked fair to.  She tried to pick it up only to find the bun had soaked and fell apart.  I opened my burger with pulled pork to find, to no surprise no pulled pork.  We just decided that this was not going to get any better and ate some of the food.  The onion rings were good, the burger was at best ok, very dry.  Our check comes and wouldn't you know it, that f___ing hot beer was still on there.  I just want out of this joint so I pay the waitress with two twenties on a 29 dollar bill.  Waitress brings me back a ten and one, one dollar bill.  No change to use as a tip, I left the one dollar bill as a tip.  This place is lacking in management and training for its employees.  If your running a bar and are only going to serve bottled beer put it in the walk in fridge a couple days before you put it on ice.  Poorly run restaurant, we won't be back.",

I got the cornbread with cinnamon butter (moist and not too sweet) and fries.  My chicken was perfectly cooked which I was surprised at because its hard not over cook chicken when you are going with skewers.  Beautiful char on the veggies as well as the chicken. The skeweres are drizzled in a mustard sauce which was to die for.  The best part .... the whole place smelled like their famous Whiskey Bread Pudding.  If we hadn't been on the way to the game, we would have ordered that for dessert!  No drink specials or happy hours on event/game night at both the Gila Arena and State Farm Stadium. Since this place is within a 5 minute walking distance of both, I'm not surprised.  Overall great experience",

The place is so unassuming with its loud and loud club music and beer pong atmosphere, as we were not the young drunk crowd.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, huge buttery bun, good flavors, pulled pork topped with coleslaw, and fries  The bf had the Saloon Burger.. he said it was cooked perfectly.. medium well .. with fries.

Since everything else seemed like a long wait to get seated, I suggested we'd eat at this restaurant. Everyone agreed to it since all they wanted were burgers and beer. As we got in, we were seated at the bar since there were open seats.  The bartender asked for our IDs and asked what we wanted to drink.  My bf asked me what I wanted so he can tell the bartender. Because I was soft spoken he was kind enough to yell for me. Lol I told my bf I wanted a blue drink so he said, \"She wants a blue drink\". The bartender replied, \"Well that sums it up.\" I like blue drinks or anything sweet really. I should have ordered my usual jack and coke but wasn't feeling it. After my bf and his friend got their beers, the bartender mixed a blue drink for me.  Fast forward to the bill. That blue drink was $9 and it was called AMF. Just googled that and it means Adios Mother F word.. lol well now I know.  The food was great and the bartender came to ask how we're doing. Good service! Def. would like to come back.",

Small portions of all items. They were all good, but not remotely worth the price. They also do big mason jars of beer, which we got since they don't do pitchers.  Lastly, the waitress was either new or clueless and couldn't answer any of our questions without asking somebody else. She was nice, though, so not the end of the world.

Finally, a manager came by, and we started talking with him, then we were interrupted by the knowing waitress. Not sure what we did to irritate her, maybe deciding not to sit at a table and going to the bar instead, so we can watch the game? I don't know, maybe that's bad etiquette... Anyway, that was some crap.   Update: The manager saw my review I saw him speak with the bartender, and then with us. He apologized and tried to make things right. The bartender was much friendlier also. We're happier than we were, the food is delicious. We may return.",

    "text": "My family visited here on a Monday evening. The place was almost empty, which was great for us. Service was solid, though not everything was smooth. My husband ordered a beer, and I tried to order a strawberry cocktail--but was informed they were out of the liquor. I guess the weekend drained their supply! I settled for water.  Our appetizer of Whiskey Rose torpedoes came out quickly and they were quite good. I can't handle a lot of heat, but I found the torpedo quite tasty... then found the spiciness right by the stem! Quite good nevertheless. I'd eat these again.  My husband had a Saloon Burger. It was cooked perfectly to his specifications. The fries were good, too.  Our son had the kid meal macaroni and cheese with fries. He quite enjoyed his food, too, and it was the perfect amount for him.  I had the rib tips with green veggie and cornbread. When I ordered, I asked what the green vegetable was today and was told it was broccolini. I was surprised to see a squash medley instead, but I liked it just fine. The rib tips were perfectly cooked, not dried out. I gave about half to my husband and they met his approval, too.  The most disappointing thing was the cornbread muffin. If you look at my picture, it's that dark, shriveled thing at about the 11 o'clock position on my plate. I'm guessing it had been kept warm under foil or in some other warm humid environment. When I tried to cut into it, it literally crumbled in my hand. The pieces were on the verge of being mushy.  I'd still try this place again on a quiet weeknight since most of the food was good and the menu has a lot to offer.",

How do you run out of baked potatoes??  They literally have bags of them at supermarkets ready to go.  No wraps.  No rib tips.  And the reason they were not offering a good chunk of the menu?  Because of the coyotes game.  Really?  On the plus side the ribs were decent.  Slaw not so bad.  Cornbread looked and felt like a soggy biscuit.  $21 for the half rack of ribs with two sides just felt crazy given the other options around the area.

I thought this place was known for their BBQ, but it was out of brisket last night (and half of the BBQ items on the menu). I ordered calamari as an appetizer - sorry it was also out. All 4 of us had to change our original order because everything we ordered was out. I ended up ordering chicken wings as an appetizer and 14oz ribeye for my entree. I was deeply disappointed since I was not here for chicken wings and steak. While we were waiting for our food, I saw many tables got up and left because many items were unavailable. Also, the room was so hot we were sweating the entire time at the restaurant. When the manager came over to check up on us, we told him about the temperature and it was ignored. By the time we left, it was actually cooler outside than the inside (and this is monsoon season by the way).   The ice tea I got taste like ice water with no flavor; the steak taste average but their corn bread was quite delicious. Service was average at best.   Overall.... *A/C doesn't work. It feels like hot sauna here *Many BBQ items are unavailable (even though that is what they are known for) *Ice tea taste like ice-water. You might as well order water *Corn bread is delicious.  I will not recommend this place.",

Bloody Marys were on special and I love some NA beverage so I opted for one.  It came loaded into a Mason jar garnished with 3 jumbo olives.  Who invented the bloody Mary garnish anyway?  Clearly I owe them my life because those little appetizer snacks are amazing!  The mix was delicious and not too spicy, just the way I like it!  My friends ordered appetizers like deep fried mac n cheese and fried pickles.  I dove in for The Mesquite Biddy.  I was in love with this dish for the name.  It was a mesquite-marinated chicken breast loaded with barbecue sauce, fried onion straws, and chipotle Cole slaw on Texas Toast.  Yum, yum yum.  I had a side of the slaw and though the flask of additional barbecue sauce they brought out was adorable.  Great memorable meal with good friends.  What else do I need?  Woo Hoo!",

Even when it's packed I get served very quickly. The dance floor is kind of small but I've never had a problem dancing there. The girls will show you all the dances too! I met some really nice people there! Everyone that goes seems to just be out to have good time and not bother anyone. I also love the little lounge outside. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the music can be very very loud. Which I know is part of being out at a bar but it's just a bit excessive.",

BBQ shrooms was a good appetizer and our entrees included smoked chicken fettuccine, pulled pork, balsamic steak salad, and a cup of chili. Portions are HUGE! The \"cup\" of chili was served in a bowl, the salad could have fed at least two of us. Not only did we get a ton of food, but it was all delicious. Such large portions allowed for a lot of sharing, and everyone loved everyone else's dishes as well as their own dish. Corn bread, Caesar salad, and sweet potato fries were served as sides and they did not disappoint either. Our server was polite, efficient, and extremely helpful. I only wish we lived closer to eat here more often!",

My group and I walked into Hells Half Acre immediately after the party and if you care to read about my God-awful experience there than please do.   But following that experience we found ourselves watching the game right outside WR's patio fence. The security guard there is the main reason I'm writing this review. He was tall and stern as you would imagine most security guards to be but he was a really great down to earth guy as well. I was so distraught from my experience next door and he let me vent to him my frustrations and made me feel like I wasn't alone. The longer the game went on the cooler he became and I had to thank him for somewhat restoring my mood after what had happened.   We were standing outside the establishment so I can't comment on the food or drinks but I will say that from what I saw, they didn't outsell their capacity. Just about everyone inside actually had a table unlike next door where it was tighter than a pack of sardines and it seemed that the rest of their staff was accommodating as well.   So Thank you Whiskey Rose for hiring security staff that doesn't feel the need to prove something and actually treating people with respect. On a night like last night, I really appreciated that!",

This afternoon my wife and I decided to drop by around the beginning of happy hour for a drink and early dinner. The restaurant was completely deserted, we were the only customers. We sat at the bar and she jokingly said (with a smile) \"Wow, where is everyone?\" to the bartender. He responded by launching into an outrageously condescending explanation of 9-5 jobs and why the average person would never be at a restaurant/bar in the afternoon. We should have just left at this point but, against our better judgement, we actually stayed and placed an order.  The rest of our time there was spent listening to the bartender (a guy with a large beard, backwards hat, and lots of tattoos- in case anyone in management reads this and is wondering). We basically endured a long lecture about the local restaurant industry and how he's the greatest salesman of all time and makes piles of money. And no point was he anything other than arrogant and rude. We actually tipped $0, which I'm not sure I've ever done, considering that my wife and I have both previously spent a great deal of time working in restaurants.   Unfortunately, the food was excellent and it's a shame that one of their employees made the entire experience so outrageously unpleasant that I'll never go back.",

We were there about an hour when a new \"shift\" started. The new bouncer decided that we needed to leave. We were apparently trouble?! My wife (of 23 years with 2 kids in college) and I were somewhat forcibly escorted out (our party of 11 followed) because we \"needed to leave\".  It was unbelievable. We have been at a thousand establishments around the country, and have never experienced such a bizarre situation.  It was like the bouncer felt like he wasn't doing his job unless he kicked someone out. We all shook our heads afterwards to try to make sense of it. Seriously, walk right past this place! It's almost dangerous to go there because you could end up having the cops interrogate you after the \"bouncer\" kicks you out. Any response they have to this is going to be phony...please spend your money at a reputable establishment that is appreciative of your business.",

My husband and I went there before the Coyotes game tonite and let me just suffice to say, there is a definite reason why all the other places around had a half hour wait and Whiskey Rose was only half full.   Without writing a novel, the service was literally non-existent and the food worse than mediocre.  After paying 30.00 for two appetizers (that finally appeared cold and greasy 40 min after ordering), and a drink... we left the food half eaten, had to ask 3 times for the check, and proceeded to eat chicken tenders and fries at the arena that were 100% better than the food at Whiskey Rose.  Not sure whether the inedible food was the fault of the kitchen or the wait staff that let it sit there (we asked 3 different servers over the course of 20 minutes to check on it for us), but either way it was horrible.  My best advice is to wait for a seat at one of the other establishments around, because this place is a bust and obviously does not have staff or management that care to make it any different.  Can I give it no stars?!",

So our original waitress brings back the drinks and takes our order.... after a while she brings our entrees, she had forgot the appetizer.. we asked another waitress for some water as we did not see ours for awhile, we did not get water from her.. the original came back, we asked again for water and she did get it promptly... then as we were eating I notice our watiress at a table somewhat behind ours, she was talking to the people at that table and seemed to know them, she was there a good 10 minutes.. checking her phone , texting etc.. There were 4 waitresses for about 18 guests, not tables of guests but guests total.. My wife said her steak salad was good, she had her dressing on the side.. my ceasar with salmon was ok, but way to much dressing on it..  They did not have draft beer which was surprising.. we decided on cocktails.. they were fairly weak..  Do yourself a favor and do not bother with this place..",

The food was actually pretty good if you've never had the Fry's, that is something you should have probably best fries and the entire Valley. I won't give it away but they are super delish. I also had the steak which to be frank it's not worth 30 bucks, it has like some kind of barbecue A1 sauce and so I would just tell you save your money and get the Burger. A friend of mine had the burger, and it was okay, but I'd like to check out maybe some more of the options. The real draw of this places that they play stinking great country music, although they have a very small dance floor so be ready for that, not a lot of people dancing, but if you want to dance this is the place on the west side. The Waitresses were okay, I'm not too bad but I did run dry a couple times of my whiskey and my beer, the bartender at the front bar, was not very attentive and to be honest a shot of my fire jack cost me 9 bucks, if you are a True cowboy remember to sneak it in your boot. Other than that I probably would come again if I didn't really want to party too hard, as a country boy or if I felt like I could dance and not be too crowded. The snacks are legit, the nachos are good, come to have some beers and appetizers and you'll be great!",

They had some great Sunday drink specials, $5 Bloody Mary's and $12 bottomless mimosas.  They also were running a check in special for a free appetizer so be sure to check Yelp the next time you go.  We ordered the Avocado Egg rolls for our free app, my lunch companions ordered a burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were happy with their food.  Even though it was lunch, the portions were enough to feed two people.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Poutine which was NOT traditional poutine. The dish was more of an open faced sandwich with a slice of bread on the bottom, pulled pork on top, then a scoop of mashed potatoes topped with cheese, and finished off with gravy.  The dish was good, just not what I was expecting, especially since the gravy had chucks of carrots and celery in it.  I did enjoy the pulled pork and would like to try that on its own as a dish.  I also got the mac and cheese as my side and it was just ok.  Service was a little slow when it came to taking orders but the place was hopping because of the game so be prepared to be patient if an event is going on.  Our food came out quickly once we were able to order.  As I saw on other reviews, the music from this location, as well as the neighboring restaurants, can get pretty loud so conversation can be limited.  Overall, a nice place to stop in for some grub before an event.",

I have never seen another place offer these so it was great to see them on the menu. Beans were a little salty for my taste but the mac was great. If you order the nachos make sure you have a buddy cause it's a big plate!  Update: post game they were slammed. Obviously. Didn't order food but every bartender/bar back/host/waitress was working their ass off. Seriously impressed that a crew can go from a slow time where they can joke and have fun to a slammed bar where all hands are on deck working their ass off. Kudos to the bar/hosts/kitchen and everyone else in between. But the supervisors and managers must be very proud. This was a great stop before and after the game. Hope they can keep it up.",

I'm really tired of these lame ass restaurants with self deserving ass kids being too lazy to actually run the damn things. I'm not kidding, I feel like I'm in a Tijuana bar minus the awesome street taco smell.   Guess 39 is too old to venture the bars anymore, we're being pushed to the fail safe dark dungeon dive bars that are ironically.. SOOO much more comfortable AND clean.",

    "text": "Never going here and wasting my money, horrible service and treatment from the bouncers and management.   Me and my friend went here around 8 PM on a Friday, it wasn't busy at all so we figured we would get something to eat but the bouncer had to check our ID's, so we gave them to him and he was suspicious saying they were fake and all that, we didn't mind that he was suspicious since that's his job but after he checked them through a card swiper he called management and this guy came as well acting all tough saying we weren't 21+ and that we're dumb for using fake ID's. Being angry we just said we would take our ID's and go somewhere else then and they said no that they would keep our ID's and the only way we would get them back is if the authorities came. The manager said he would call them and after standing around doing nothing we asked are they on their way and he simply said no if we want them we go get them. So not only did he contradict himself and act like a fool, he didn't do what he said he would... So we went and got Glendale Police.   After they discussed things the officers talked to us saying the bar can refuse service to whoever and all and it was just a precaution, they gave us our ID's back! We understood but what made me angry is how foolish and aggressive they were behaving for no reason and I don't think they can take our ID's just like that. Didn't realize acting like an ass when we gave them no reason too is part of their job description. Hopefully no one has to deal with what we did but that's my 2 cents and this experience determined my choice of never going back.",

So disappointing,  location was great and it was a perfect evening to sit outside and relax a bit update! The food came out and was actually pretty good! The manager came out and had a much better explanation... their ac went out so I'm assuming if we come back on a day that isn't going on the wine will be an okay choice.

Wife and I shared a burger. Wife wanted it well done, it came back medium rare. That was a good thing for me since I like my burgers rare. I thought the burger was very good, since it wasn't burnt(well done) it had a very good flavor. Not much on the fries. To salty and greasy. We also shared the jalapeno torpedoes.This is a Jalapeno stuffed with pulled pork, cream cheese, wrapped in bacon. Very good. Service was good, very nice. Prices are fine. Now it seems like they are not sure what they should wear? Almost like they can wear what every they want, as long it's black. Waitresses where wearing shorts, paints, t-shirt, or a collard shirt. some were actually wearing their jacket around their waste.  Anyway, I still liked it enough to come back on my next visit.",

She brought me a refill, didn't ask if he wanted one, and his glass was empty....he was drinking water. She asked me several times if I needed anything, never said a word to him.   When we got the check, she put it by me, asked if we were still working on the nachos. My husband replied, no and asked for a box. She said ok.  I gave her my card to pay the bill. When she came back, she gave my card back and said have a good night.   I asked another staff member for a box, she brought it back and handed it to my husband. He said, see that's how normal people act.   If this was the 1st time, I wouldn't think much of it, but this has happened more than once. I tease him that she might be intimidated because he's a big guy. Lol. I don't know that her deal is, but if we come back, we won't be sitting on the patio again, since that seems to be her area.",

Sunday afternoon my husband and I went shopping and decided to have a nice lunch and a few drinks, he suggested Whiskey Rose. We sat on the fairly empty patio and waited for a server. Two gentlemen came in about 5 minutes later and sat at a table directly behind us and immediately a girl came and gave them menus and took their  drink order, she didn't even acknowledge us. A minute later another girl walked out and right past us and went and asked the gentlemen if they had been helped and then again she walked right past us and didn't say a word. After letting it sink in for a second we looked at each other like wow that really just happened and  we got up and left. Obviously it's very clear these girls are trained to think that two gentlemen are more important than a married man and wife and to take special care of them before even acknowledging us. We will not be back. We will not recommend this establishment even to our friends or sons who go as a group of just men. For the record my husband and I are over tippers - to the point our credit card company contacts us regularly asking if we meant to tip that high. Your loss and another establishments gain I suppose. Your poor management in training and oversight will drive a lot of good paying customers away.",

I called several places that would not take reservations as its their policy not to take reservations when there are large events at the Glendale Arena.  Whiskey Rose was the only one that said they would take reservations and so I placed them for 20 people.  I called back a week later and spoke to a male manager and up'd reservation to 25 people.  He said no problem and we will look forward to seeing you.  When I arrived the hostess said that the reservation was canceled and they could not accommodate us inside but if we wanted to sit outside they could turn on some fans! (it was 113 degrees outside).  I asked for the manager and Mia came out to apologize but they could not seat 25 people and that the reservation should never had been taken.  I pointed out that it was taken and I had even spoken to a manager............why did you not contact me to cancel the reservation and give me notice?  Mia...said. we meant to but forgot about it and have just been too busy.  I was pretty adamant  that I have 25 clients arriving any minute and we need to create a space or do something to fix this.  I pointed out several options and ideas to move people around to make some sort of space...  Mia followed my recommendations and we were able to fit about 15 people.  It was a fricking  mad house.  I will never go back or recommend this place!",

    "text": "Maybe this place is great on the weekends during party dance club time but it is absolutely awful for midweek restuarant causual dining.   I was looking for a date night idea and found a groupon for whiskey rose for $20 worth of food and drinks for $12. I thought we would give it a try for dinner on a Thursday evening. When we got to the restuarant, more so bar...around 8:30pm and it was awkwardly empty. The middle of the place had a huge open area where it looks like dancing may occur? No staff was present and we had no idea if we sat ourselves, waited to be seated or if they were even serving food. While the bf and I discussed if we even wanted to bother with staying a server came up and we had an odd conversation if they were serving food. The verdict was they serve food till 10pm but they really didn't want to do that and would prefer we sat at the bar. We got the hint very quickly and peaced out. I am very sad that I lost my $12 to the groupon I purchased but feel I saved myself a lot of money, time and patience by just leaving.  This place is listed as a bar and grill otherwise I would have never bothered trying to go as a restuarant where I could get food. Like Hell's Half Acre next door straight out tells you they are a bar. None the less we went to the Yardhouse where there were actual customers and staff that wanted to help you.   If you are looking for a nightclub type seen this is the place for you.",

    "text": "I had gotten a groupon for this place last week because we happened to be in the area and I was hungry. The place was mostly empty (thursday night) with a couple of DJ's blaring loud country music for a couple of people dancing. Folks sitting at the bar were watching the game with one extra passionate fan cheering, hooting, and hollering.   None of that bothered us, we just sat in the back and ordered out food. I got the cobb salad with ranch dressing and feta cheese instead of blue cheese. This salad is MASSIVE and tasted good but was a little too busy for me with too much going on - still great tasting though and I hardly put a tend in it by the time I was full. My husband had pulled pork (dry) with baked beans and macNcheese. The pull pork was on point! Dry does NOT mean dry, just leaner, but still juicy with just enough fat! Baked beans were good and the macNcheese were okay too but I wouldn't order them as a side again.  Service was excellent - friendly and attentive, had no problems using the groupon either.  Edit* 2/14/17 So, we went to Whiskey Rose a second time b/c we liked it the 1st time... The second visit was on a Saturday  and the place was crowed (as expected) but we were seated right away (we chose to sit by the bar this time). There was no DJ or life music. And this time the food (mainly the starter) and service wasn't that great.  Avocado egg rolls were cold - probably because they were served 5 minutes after ordering. While I like quick service, I like fresh and hot food better. We had to ask for utensils after the server gave us our avocado rolls. Husband had the pulled pork sandwich with with fries and a cornbread muffin - he liked it all. I had the THE MESQUITE BIDDY (MESQUITE MARINATED GRILLED CHICKEN / BBQ SAUCE / FRIZZLED ONIONS / AVOCADO / APPLE-CHIPOTLE SLAW / PEPPER JACK CHEESE / BUTTERED TEXAS TOAST) which I liked.  What bothered me the most was the I was able to watch the bartenders and servers handle drinks. Almost every single one touched and handled the drinks by the rim of the glass/cup. For instance - On some beers I counted four different people touching the rim, FOUR! No-one drinks beer with a straw, so the customer has 4 different peoples' hands all on their lips. The mixed drinks and cocktails at least get a straw to same a customer from funk but still...   It ruined my appetite after I watched 6+ people doing this.",

Okay, so tonight (Sunday), we decided to head over for dinner.  The dining room wasn't crowded at all.  We were greeted immediately, and our drinks were brought to us within a few minutes.  We ordered an appetizer, the potato skins, but didn't want the chili on top of them.  No problem, and they were really good!  Hubby went with the ribs, with slaw and mac n'cheese.  I chose the brisket, with a salad and cornbread w/honey butter.  OMG!  Everything was so tasty and delicious.  My salad came before the meal, and it was cold and crisp...very refreshing.  Our meals were so wonderful.  Hubby's ribs literally fell off the bone, his mac n'cheese was really cheesy and he seemed to really enjoy his cole slaw.  My brisket was tender and moist, the BBQ sauce is sweet (which I love!) and the cornbread w/honey butter was so good!!  We also decided to get a dessert, the Ghirardelli brownie with ice cream.  I was pretty full, but had to try some of the brownie...sinful!  The service was also worth the 5 stars.  We were visited a few times by the manager, who also assisted with taking empty plates and making sure everything was okay.  And, our waitress, Taylor, was very attentive, as well as knowledgeable about the food/menu.  We had a few questions, since it was our first time, and she was able to answer all of them.  Overall, this was a delicious and pleasant experience.  This is definitely just the first of many visits.  I can't wait to try some more things on their menu.",

Even though everyone in our party had less than 4 drinks the GM Abe kicked our party out for the waitress's salty attitude towards not receiving a tip for horrible service. Both this place and Salt are run by the same GM so I recommend avoiding both and going to any other bar around the place to get your money's worth.",

    "text": "So we came out for the U2 concert and was looking for somewhere to eat and decided to come here since we are here most Saturdays for Nebraska football games (we are members of Huskers of Arizona and this is one of their watch sites). It was pretty crowded since the concert was across the street. We were expecting a wait.the wait was 45 minutes for a table and then another 45 minutes for the food. We decided to get a drink and wait. A couple who had come in after us was seated immediately. I asked if they had been waiting long and she said no they took them right away. What type of management works here, this is completely unacceptable and insulting. I guess only certain customers are the right customers. If you are a Nebraska fan, don't attend the football games here, there are plenty of other Nebraska bars that treat their customers with the utmost respect.",

Our waitress however is a goddess and super fun.  She wins the day over the food which was fine.  Bartender was super nice even though I didnt order beer, very cheerful as he pointed me to the hombres water closet.  When I say Goddess I am not exaggerating by the way. So women, if you are on a date you should stick over by the bar and stay away from the patio.",

We went there last night before the Yotes game and wanted to sit outside. Now mind you it was only 3:30pm and there were people sitting out there and several empty tables. The three giggling nitwits at the door told us we couldn't be seated outside because \"they were expecting it to be full capacity and needed to save those seats\". What? There were 5 empty tables and I'm here now,a PAYING loyal customer but we were refused after asking 3 times to sit out there. When I said fine we'll go some place else they laughed at us and just said \"goodbye\" sarcastically.   We took our money to another place and had a great meal OUTSIDE like we wanted. We probably drop over two grand in this place over the course of the year between all the Cards home games, several Yotes games,business lunches and all the times we visit with our out of town guest. Your loss WR as we will never return!",

Country western/classic rock live band, cold beer & a solid menu that offers among other things, Westgate's best pulled pork BBQ was my first trip into this place on opening weekend. Tonight I had dinner and their steak rivals any Westside chop house. Each day features a special Mac n Cheese, the Tornado appetizers, and house salad were all served up beautifully. No band tonight, but plenty of various sporting events on the TVs. I don't think you could be in there and not be facing at least 2 screens. I am HARDLY a c/w fan but this place has a good vibe, solid menu and pleasant staffers who were attentive w/o being overbearing.  If you need a fun lol' honkytonk, or a place for a cold one before or after a Yotes or Cards game, Give this place a try... Food was WAY better than Toby Keith's and service was better too.",

We pulled Our IDs thinking that was their purpose but it wasn't and we were told we'd be checked inside. So, we went to the bar and ordered beers and asked for a food menu.  The beers came out quickly but a good 20 minutes passed after several attempts to flag down the bar tender before we could simply order an appetizer.  When I say this, I mean we were literally ignored.  I even made the reach over/wave my arm motion I'm attempt to get someone's attention on more than one occasion.    The irritating part is that the ladies behind the bar were to busy reorganizing things to notice their customers.   We finally ordered an appt that wasn't good (avocado egg rolls.) Even Chilis has better egg rolls.  The last straw was when we asked for the bill. They gave just the the bill.  No receipt showing what we actually spent.   Ummmmmmmmm almost $40 for two beers and an appetizer. Thanks for the kiltlifter but no thanks.",

We started off with the jalapeno appetizer stuffed with cheesy pulled pork and wrapped in bacon (I forget the official name.) my husband loved them, but he would eat anything as long as it was wrapped in bacon! I didn't quite care for the stuffing which was pulled pork and cheese. it was the consistency of mush and really didn't have much flavor. To me, it tasted like spicy bacon. We both ordered the combo with 2 meats. I had the chicken and rib tips with onion rings and baked beans. The portions were HUGE and could easily feed 2 people. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was slightly smokey and the BBQ sauce was sweet and skin was charred. I did not like the rib ends, they were mostly gristle and bones. They were very disgusting to eat and got hardly any meat off of them, just to be fair, I never ordered these before so I'm not sure if they come with so many tiny bones. The onion rings were very good and tasted like a beer batter. The baked beans were not to my tasting, they were sweet, but overwhelmingly tasted like chili powder. They basically tasted like a really sweet chili. This place was a hit and miss for me. The staff were super friendly, although I didn't care for their \"hooters-like\" attire. I may be back, but have other favorite BBQ places in town I'd rather go.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were out at Westgate for the Packers/Cardinals playoff pregame festivities yesterday and to watch the game.  We decided on having food and drinks at Whiskey Rose because it is (or should I say used to be) our go-to place when we are at Westgate.  We sat at the bar as usual, ran into a friend of mine and proceeded to have a good time watching the game and conversing with other patrons.  Neither of us was rude or obnoxious to any bartender, server or patron at any time and there were no issues with anything whatsoever.  After some time, one of the bartenders pointed at my boyfriend and motioned to the bouncer at the door.  My boyfriend was called outside and was told to leave.  He asked why and was not given an answer but was told again to leave.  None of the people we were conversing with knew why we were being asked to leave, either.  We paid our tab, did not leave a tip, and went to McFadden's where we were treated very kindly.  We will not be back to Whiskey Rose ever again.  It is one thing to be asked to leave an establishment if you are ill-behaved, but to be asked to leave for no reason and not be given one?  That is not the way you run a business and expect to have repeat customers.  We always run a decent tab when we go out and tip our servers very generously, so it is unfortunate for this establishment that we will be taking our business elsewhere.  Oh, and the chicken nachos were disgusting.",

    "text": "So i finally decided to review all my favorite places in town here so lets have at it!  I have come here for awhile now mainly for the great food and relaxed vibe that i get whenever I come here. That being said what really motivated me to leave this review was a recent visit. I came out Saturday night before pro bowl to see how the place was during the night. I'm not much of a partier but I don't mind havin a few drinks every now an then. So I stroll up around 10 ish and as per usual there was a pretty lively guy at the door with a huge smile greeting everyone and asking people how there days had been and if they were ready to have a good time. Now from afar walking up you would prolly peg this guy just as I did upon first sight as a angry tough acting door guy judging by his appearance, full thick beard with a winter hat(beanie) and full arm tattoos. But boy was I wrong every time I have come here and he is there its always pleasant I'm pushing 50 now and because it's his job he has always asked to see my ID and I have no problems showing it. The funny thing is he will always crack a joke and call me young man after seeing my ID which really starts off every visit pleasant.   Well the buck don't stop there folks because when I got inside another gentlemen greeted me with a great big smile and asked how I was doing which I responded with \"great \" I presume he is also security hence the T shirt marked Security. So the crowd was very lively the DJ was playing a great mix of hip hop n country which you would think??? what?? but take my word the DJ makes it work and work great! ya know a lil something for everyone. So I ordered me up a plain ol whiskey and coke I mean come on the place is called Whiskey Rose so I felt it only fitting. Took a nice sip and bam like always the great great bartenders mixed me a fine drink. The night went on more people shuffled in and it really got jumpin the whole night was such a great time the mood was absolutely positive all night! I saw a few patrons who were asked to leave which is understandable it is a bar, but overall there wasn't anything that made me believe the bar attracted a bad crowd great people all night fun conversations and just plain beautiful people all around.  All in all I think this is just a great place where the service is top notch from top to bottom I mean hell even their security has the same enthusiasm as the bartenders and servers just everyone in the building is great!!! I can go on and on about the food but I'll keep it short I've tried maybe a dozen or so dishes from the menu and a slew of appetizers A+ on everything so go there for yourself pick anything off the menu and I'm sure you will love it! Last and certainly not least try one of the many ways they do mac n cheese simply delicious. I know no place is perfect or even close you cant please everybody but Whiskey Rose has been so consistent always good food great atmosphere and great people and its refreshing to see that. Go out and get some is what I'll end with!!!",
