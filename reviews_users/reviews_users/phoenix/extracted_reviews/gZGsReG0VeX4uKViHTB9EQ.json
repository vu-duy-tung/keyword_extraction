    "text": "I have been eating at this restaurant since it opened back in 2001. Don Ruben's has become a huge portion of my life and I cannot be more grateful towards this restaurant for consistently providing excellent food, service, prices and atmosphere. Every meal at Don Ruben's tastes fresh, delicious, and authentic. Although I haven't had everything on the menu personally, many family members and friends over the years describe their meals just the same. Truly this Sonoran Style Mexican Food is worth every penny.    Some of my favorite eats here, besides their chips and salsa that I smother everything in, is their cheese quesadilla (cheese crisp), poco pollo pizza, cheese enchiladas, tacos, and many more! Their quesadilla is by far the best I've ever had and is a house favorite. I have been to several Mexican food restaurants in AZ and I always order a cheese crisp just so I can compare to Don Ruben's cheese crisp. Believe me when I tell you, Don Ruben's is by far the best. Each bite is cheesy, flaky, crispy, and golden. Put their refreshing mild salsa on it and you're in heaven. The poco pollo pizza also has a delicious deep fried tortilla base with flavorful jalapeno cream cheese, shredded chicken and green enchilada sauce that will make you want to eat the whole pizza to yourself. I also recommend trying their cheese enchiladas, tamales, flautas (rolled tacos), and tacos. These menu items are an absolute staple and must-try along with a side of rice and beans. I've also had Don Ruben's catered several times and each time everyone has flocked over to the fiesta platter that has my favorite, the delightful mini chimi's!    Every menu item at Don Ruben's is so beyond joyous to eat and very affordable!! The most I've spent on myself was a grand total of $25. That included: drink (non-alcoholic), chips and salsa, cheese crisp, combo dinner, and sopapillas! I got more than my money's worth and I was more than satisfied and extremely full. I have also been counting down the days for my 21st birthday so that I can finally try their margaritas, from what I hear are to die for!   Overall, Don Ruben's has always been a fantastic place for food, service, and company. Don Ruben's is my go-to restaurant because of how much I love not only their food but their unfailing excellent service. I've never waited more than 30 minutes even on a very busy Saturday! I'm always greeted with the warmest smiles and very familiar faces. I also love how Steve, the owner of Don Ruben's, goes around the restaurant to greet customers and make them feel as comfortable as possible. Every waiter/waitress has been expertly trained and knows how to accommodate all kinds of party sizes! Food comes out fast, hot, and presentable. My order has NEVER been messed up either! On a more personal level, Don Ruben's has been a place that I consider my family dinner table. I've planned a meal here for almost every life event; graduation gatherings, countless birthday celebrations, family reunions, business outings, and many more! Their atmosphere excites me and makes me feel a part of their family. Don Ruben's has a way of filling not just your stomach but your heart. I highly recommend waiting in line and getting a taste for you and your family and friends to enjoy!",

    "text": "I, my wife, and my two daughters went here at about 5:00 on a Thursday afternoon. Service was good and the atmosphere was friendly until the waiter (Izzy, I believe) brought us our food and then rushed off.  Unfortunately, my daughter's dinner was incorrect. The waiter never checked back to see if everything was OK. I tried waving him down three or four times when he passed nearby but never got his attention. The next time I saw him I called over to him in a polite tine of voice but he ignored me. Then I tried a slightly louder tone of voice and he still ignored me. Finally, with him disappearing into the kitchen and my daughter still having nothing to eat, I called out to him in a loud voice and that he heard.  The waiter then noted the error and got a new dinner from the kitchen. But by the time that happened, the rest of us were almost done eating. I then asked the waiter to comp the incorrect item in view of the error and his inattention, but he said the restaurant doesn't do that. He said I could only talk to the manager.  It took the manager quite a while to come out, and when I told her this story and asked that the food be comped, she not only refused but was angry and rude to me.  The waiter should have checked back to see if the food was OK, and it shouldn't have been  that hard to get his attention, and no employee in any profession should ever be angry and rude to a customer.  Not recommended.",

I was so glad to see green chile in many items. In California, most places think peppers or tomatillo is green chile, but it's so not!  I had green chile enchiladas with chicken - very delicious. Not overly spicy, so the flavor was emphasized. They do have spicier dishes. My husband had their taco salad and said it was the best one he ever had. The service was amazing, considering the place was full. Our lunch came out quickly and was fantastic.  I wish I could take them home with me!",

What I found was that is what they would call in Houston True Tex-Mex meaning Mexican made for American tastes and totally bland. The place was packed, but, for the life of me, I have no idea why--except that the White people think this is real Mexican food.  Go figure?  A clue would have been not one Mexican/Hispanic in the place for lunch. I ordered the fajitas for $15.  Tons of beans which were good, tons of rice which was same as every Mexican restaurant uses and really very little fajitas.  BIG disappointment. The chips they serve with salsa at every table are good, tho, with the chips being thin and non-greasy which was wonderful. But the fajitas...no bueno.  Are they saving the meat for the dinner service?  Who knows, but I know I walked out feeling royally taken.  For $15 you should get a heaping pile of fajitas and not just a small amount of meat.  Very disappointing, and I have no desire to ever go back here now.",

Margaritas are great. the Carnitas dinner is the best, especially accompanied by the Ranchero Beans in place of the refried beans. And they will switch those beans with other orders if you ask, I've done it many times.. The green chili con carne is outstanding and rice included has always been so good.  Since I've moved here I have taken others here also and they are always impressed. I just wish it was bigger, usually have a little bit of a wait, but it's worth it. And they truly care if you are having a pleasant experience. Oh, and tamales available to order by the dozen for your special occasion, they are the bomb!",

Both of us are fans of Mexican food, and this spot was right around the corner from, her house.  When we arrived, at about 1pm, there was only a single table available, but we were seated immediately, and our server was quite pleasant.  We decided to split a couple of appetizers and opted for a cheese crisp with green chile and a platter of other sides.  The  platter was good, but the star for me was the crisp.  It was perfectly crisp, flaky and delicious.   Their service was quick and pleasant, their prices quite reasonable, and the atmosphere comfortable. I will come back next time I am in town!

We found this restaurant via \"What's Nearby\" while we we needed to kill time before checking into our Airbnb.  The description sounded good, so we headed towards Don Rubens.  I ordered the Blake Tacos (grilled and marinated steak).  Let's stop there for a moment.  Yowza!  Often times steak in tacos can be a bit tough and sometimes grisly.  This steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor.  Top it off with melted pepper jack cheese and they were the most amazing tacos I've ever had.  The beans were even amazing!  Great flavor.  The staff was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.  The house margarita was tasty and priced well.  My friend ordered the cheese enchilada and chicken taco.  She fell in love with how tender the chicken was and how amazing the cheese melted to bring all of the flavors together.  As an out-of-towner, I would return to this place whenever I'm in town just for those dang Blake Tacos!!    Why the 4-stars then?  Although we were warned the plate was very hot, I didn't figure it to be the temperature of lava.  Holy heck!  My finger was sore for the next hour.  The plate was hot for a long time which made the food too hot to handle for a good 5-10 minutes after it was served.  Regardless, I would totally return without any reservations regarding the quality of the food or service at Don Rubens Mexican Food.",

We were charged $1.50 for two tablespoons of sour cream which should have been free since it was supposed to be in lieu of dressing.  Absolutely no flavor in anything, not the guacamole, not the salsa, not the meat..,nothing. My dish was covered in clearly cheddar cheese with cream cheese sandwiched between my tortilla and chicken. The refried beans were a tasteless paste and the rice was rice only in name.  I can forgive in-authenticity but I won't be back to eat food that tastes like nothing.

We waited about 20-25 minutes to be seated (as we were quoted), the place was packed, and now I know why!!!    EVERYTHING (and I do mean everything) was hot, fresh, and full of flavor. The hostesses, the waiters, and the waitresses were pleasantly attentive.   We will DEFINITELY return to Don Ruben's Mexican!!!!!!",

The kids did a great job of entertaining themselves and the wait was only about 10 minutes with a group of 5.  The waiter was very impressive, working with us on kids meals and the request for extra rice for my daughter that can never get enough rice in her life.  They were great with the kids and everything flowed very well.  Food was very authentic and tasty.  I got the shrimp burrito, T got the bean burrito.",

Employees are always friendly, the chips and salsa are quickly served and delicious, and the service itself is speedy. The menu offers a variety of authentic Mexican food, but I will note that the less pricy options don't have the same quality. I once ordered a bean burrito (literally--nothing but beans in the burrito) and a side of rice and paid close to eight dollars for it. The burrito had little to no flavor; I was thoroughly grateful the salsa compensated for it. Vegan options are practically nonexistent but the other food I ate there before becoming a vegan was indeed worth the price.",

I would normally give this place only 3 stars but I was wowed by our waiter when the pitcher of margaritas I ordered for the table came to us as a full pitcher in addition to every glass being full as well. Most places just don't do that and it was a very nice gesture to make up for the extra few minutes we had to wait for them to make it.   I don't know if this kind of behavior can be expected per se, but I am definitely grateful for that added touch and they found a way to differentiate themselves from the hundreds of other Mexican food places in phoenix...for me anyway.  They deserve an honest shot in my opinion. Don't know if I will rush back, but I am glad I tried them.",

I asked 3 different people to bring water for hubby and I (we were the last in our group to arrive) and we wound up with one water glass. However, they were quick to bring refills of chips and salsa, and checked on us frequently throughout the meal. The water glasses may have been a fluke because it was a pretty crowded table and we didn't have any other issues with the service. The food was decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. Yeah, I know it is Mexican and I'm a wimp. No one else seemed to mind, so take that with a grain of salt. It did seem to sit a bit lighter than most Mexican food, so that was good. The margaritas were STRONG and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us.",

SCORCHING, so be careful!  These cheese crisps are THE BEST in town. If I could figure out how to make these at home, I'd be breaking fat person records. Best I leave this one to the pro's.    Since I'm continuing my quest to find something wrong with Don Ruben's, I tried something different on the menu, as did my gf. I did the Carne Asada tacos, she did the Spinach Enchiladas. Two plates full of AWESOME coming right up!   The low rating befuddles us, and the recent accusations of \"imposter postings\", or \"shill postings\" throws us off, so we talk about what WOULD make Don Ruben's a 5. We can't think of anything.   This is the best Mexican food in the Valley. There's a few others I'm obligated to try, (DAMMIT!) but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to get a fair comparison, and to bring an accurate review to my beloved Yelp.",

One was a party of ten, that did not have a reservation  After waiting 35 minutes, they sat the party of ten who came in 20 minutes later, pushing three tables together that should have accommodated the three parties who were waiting there much longer. (Btw, Their waiting area is small, very warm, with virtually no air circulation. ..think 10x10 sweatbox.). By ignoring all of the parties that were waiting so long before the party of 10 came in, they displayed a complete lack of concern for their customers comfort as THEY MADE IT OBVIOUS THEY ONLY THINK ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL NEEDS & PROFIT.  What's worse, we received no apologies, only insulting lies as excuses: 1. \"The party had a reservation,\" and 2. \"They can't control the wait time.\"  1. Certainly, the party of 10 DID NOT have a reservation as they arrived after us and their name was written down 3 parties below ours on the list; and, 2. Management DID control the wait time, as they made a managerial decision (based on perceived profit from a larger check total) to push three tables together to accommodate one party rather than the three parties waiting much longer that should have been seated.  In consequence, they lost a \"regular\" and all of our future business.  Even worse, besides lying to us, they did nothing to acknowledge they did us wrong.  They lied about the wait, the reason for extending the wait, and they obviously care less about their customer's comfort or business (if you're a party of less than 10 persons)!  Another issue: they used to have great food worth waiting for, but the quality has dropped significantly since we first started dining here.  In the long run, they did us a favor, as their food has been hit-or-miss, so-so to average for quite a while; we just went because we remember how it used to be...now, we see it as it is.  If you like Americanized Mexican food, which is what they serve at Don Rubins, try Manuel's instead.",

I ordered a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, chile relleno, beef taco with rice and beans. Without going into detail, all of it was delicious and fresh. Their chips and salsa are excellent. The chips are very thin and just perfect. The service wasn't very fast but was worth the wait and very friendly. I was checked on multiple times throughout my meal.

I usually stick to a few of the same things. One being their Beef Chimichanga Dinner with rice and beans. Perfectly fried tortilla, tender and well seasoned beef, salty beans, and decent Spanish rice. Another being their Pork Carnitas Dinner. Their house margaritas are also tasty.

The beef fajitas were delicious but there could have been more actual beef.   Overall the portions are good and prices fairly average. Not bad for very good food.",

This cost I simply asked for a cheese crisp with guacamole, and a cup of soup. The Skype was good and hot but the cheese crisp COLD and 7.95 !! When the waiter came and asked how everything was I told him the crisp was cold, he said, \"yeah well they put cold guacamole on top which makes the cheese crisp cold\" I said well then I would want the guacamole on the side, he said \"well, you didn't ask for it that way,\" REALLY!!?? Well I asked can you heat it up? He took it back to the kitchen (what was left) and heated it up, it came back and still wasn't hot! NO TIP TONIGHT!!! I do believe that taking food from a table back to the kitchen and then reserving it is against the health code! I am willing to give second chances as none of us are perfect but this waiter has been working there a long time!!!",

I was kind of concerned by the abundance of gringos eating here but the authenticity of the dishes was not to be second guessed!! I got the Cadillac margarita,pollo poco mexican pizza and a bowl of green chili con carne.  As a bartender the margarita passed the flavor and bang for your buck test. The pizza kinda crumbled under the pressure of my man hands but with the technological advantage of a fork it was a different story. Very delicious! And the chili con carne (green) was my favorite part! Very flavorful and meaty! Chips and salsa are above or under par(good)?! Overall, I'll be back to sample the rest of the menu!",

Everything comes out on super hot plates, everything is good to excellent. Service is impeccable, the entire operation runs very smoothly. The only bad thing, no bar to sit at. They could easily open other locations. This is not Los Dos Molinos hot mexican food, but good old Sonoran mexican that has mostly disappeared from Phoenix. Sure, there is Valle Luna, but this place is much better. Go early, place is packed. Bonus, the food is priced very fairly, but this is why you will go back, VALUE.",

The green chile burro was horrific in my opinion. The flavor was awful and it was too runny.  The rice was bland. The beans were not too bad.   The plate sat in a oven or in a salamander way to long making the plate EXTREMELY hot and burning the food.   I probably ate 1/4 to a 1/3 of the food before I couldn't eat anymore.  The silverware was pathetic, I've used plastic silverware that was more stout. With the business charging as much as they do for their food, one would think that something like silverware wouldn't be cheeped out on.  Honestly with how high the prices are and my first experience, I will not be returning for a second chance unless it was paid for by the restaurant. Sincerely, Bill.",

The cilantro ranch dressing was ok, wish there was a little more flavor. The other people seemed to also like their food. It all seemed fresh and the portions were generations while it was very inexpensive. It is also located in a strip mall with a lot of cut through traffic so be careful around the restaurant.",

We looked at the menu before heading to the restaurant and, really, it looked pretty much like any other standard, strip mall Mexican joint be it in Glendale or in my home state of Georgia.  Decided to give it a shot anyway.  The menu may be familiar but the food, ohhhh, the food.  Incredible.  The salsa, hot sauce, chips, entrees, margaritas...just an exceptional meal at a very reasonable price.  I went with the beef burro and it was unlike anything I've eaten at a Mexican place in the past.  I'm salivating now just remembering how good it was.  Those dining with me raved about their meals, as well.  Cannot recommend this place enough.  Locals are very fortunate to have this place in town and, for visitors, THIS is where you need to go.  Don't let the menu fool you.",

    "text": "We love Don Ruben's so it hurts me to write this, but the SERVICE (BAD) has been steadily declining and reached a low point that is just not acceptable a couple of nights ago when my wife and I dined there. We have been going for over 10 years and love the food. We always dine late, near closing, so I think we are always stuck with their worst servers since we seem to get one of the same three every time we go. Our major problem with Don Ruben's is we always have problems with getting refills of our chips, salsa & water. I have brought up this problem many times to the manager, but they seem not to care since the problem has gotten worse over the years.   The Problem: On Monday July 9th, we came in at 8:35 and were seated right away. The bus boy knows how much hot sauce we eat with our meal, so he brought us a basket of chips, three salsas & three hot sauces, so we are set on sauces for the night. The waiter took our drink and appetizer order quickly. The service up to this point is good, but here is where things always fall apart. When we got our appetizer at 8:45 our chips were empty and my wife's water was almost gone, but the waiter just dropped the appetizer and left. This is unusual since they ALWAYS pressure us to order before the kitchen closes at 9:00. We saw our waiter run by a couple of times, but never stopped to take our order. I asked my wife what time it was, she said three minutes before 9:00. We thought maybe our waiter thought we were not having dinner for some reason. Meanwhile, our chips are still empty and my wife is drinking my water since hers is long gone. When our waiter finally comes to take our order at one minute til 9:00 he doesn't even know what \"diablo green chili\" is for my chimichanga filling (this is a standard burro filling there). He thinks it is some kind of sauce for the top. After working out our ordering issues, we ask him for more chips and water. He goes to the kitchen and is gone for almost 10 minutes and he resurfaces with no chips or water and helps the table next to us. THAT IS IT. We decide that after being there for 25 minutes with no chips (and none with our appetizer) that we are going to cancel our order, pay for the food we ate and leave. I got up, told the waiter to cancel our order and to get the manager. The manager (who we have talked to dozens of times about everything) came and asked what the problem was. We explained the situation and she seemed to not care one bit that we were out of chips & water for almost a half an hour. She seemed too worried that our food was almost ready and that we weren't staying to eat it. We had previously (over a few years) told her that the only reason we don't eat there more is because we get tired of constantly having to ask for more chips & water. We said if your waiters can't proactively see that you need chips, salsa & drinks whenever they come to the table, maybe they should expand the bussers role into filling these instead of just bringing the initial chips and salsa.  The Conclusion: The manager didn't care and they actually brought us a bill for our appetizer. We think most places would be apologetic and try to make things right. Not this time. The bill was $11.89. We paid with $20 and the waiter brought us our change. Get this! He only brought back $8.00 even. He shorted our change by .11 cents. It's not the money ($.11) it's the principle. The manager was not around and we weren't going to wait to tell her, so we left. I don't know if we will be back.",

    "text": "I felt that I had to write a review after seeing that Don Ruben only has 3.5 stars. I mean, every time I eat here I'm pleased.   I like that the atmosphere is cozy and visually interesting--definitely not a hole-in-the-way type place.  The service is always good. It may be better for us because Don Ruben is my parents' default \"date-night\" restaurant. Today, the server came by at least 3 times to check on us, in addition to taking our order, bringing the food, and closing the check.   If you want to split a plate, they'll plate it that way in the kitchen and give you extra rice and beans for $1 extra. My mom and I did this, and still had carnitas left over. Some places make you feel bad about splitting a plate, but our server was totally gracious and offered the $1+ deal to us. After tax and tip, our total tab was under $20.  And of course, the food. I've never had the $3.75 margarita because my mom likes 1800. We didn't get it this time because it was noon on a Tuesday, but I've had it before with 1800 too, and its muy deliciosa. I'll admit the chips and salsa aren't the bestest ever, but they're still solid. We usually get the carnitas because they are BOMB. Slightly crisp, well-seasoned, keep picking at them after I'm full. I've had some of the other offerings, and recall being pleased.   Everyone seems nuts about the blah American diner next door, but I'm all about Don Ruben.",

When contacting the restaurant Stacy the manager became very abrupt and short answered when I inquired about why there was no utensils and napkins after I had asked her prior to leaving the restaurant all I got in return was I didn't hear you say you needed napkins and utensils, although that might have been factual her presentation was horrifying how do you treat a customer who pays $20 for one meal that way! The only resolution she had for me was for me to come back and pick up the utensils comma shame on the manager for not making the right choice ultimately I obviously cannot leave work again to go get utensils so therefore I must save my meal for when I get home this evening which means it will be cold and not fresh $20 down the drain thanks a lot Stacy ,very poor  customer service skills...",

    "text": "My wife and I have just about eaten here weekly (if not more often) for several years. Always excellent food and good service. It all starts with chips and tasty fresh salsa. Mild, but mix it with the hot salsa available for a bit more punch. Cheese crisp with chilis is recommended as an appetizer. Margaritas are full-strength. What entree? I'm addicted to the pork carnitas plate- plenty of shredded pork with some nice texture \"bark\", with grilled onions and peppers, served with charro beans, rice and warm tortillas. I also like the Diablo burro, or for the lighter side, a carnitas burro or large bowl of Albondigas soup (especially on a cold winter night). My wife likes the chili rellenos, tortilla soup, or one of their combo plates. I tried the sonoran salmon last week which was good but the filet was on the small side, though it was healthy and served with delicious steamed vegetables and rice. Finally, for dessert, the flan is the perfect finale and the best I've had. The only disappointment in probably a couple hundred meals was a green chili burro which was more tortilla than filling....but hey, one off night does not detract from a well-earned stellar five star rating. Thanks Don Rubens - you rock!!!  Update: the green chile chimicanga (or occassionally a burro) is now a favorite. We've upped the frequency of our visits here so much that we joke they may be thinking they need an order of protection from us as stalkers! BTW, service is always stellar! Flan recipe has changed unfortunately, but generally so full that dessert is not a need or a want.",

When you sit down they bring everyone a glass of water and chips and salsa for everyone which is a mild and a hot (which isn't very hot). The chips are thick with just the right amount of salt. I could eat them for days! The food is always piping hot and comes out really fast.  The service isn't always personable but it's always efficient. We've never had a bad meal or bad service. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "My cousin recommended this restaurant for some good Mexican food. It was 15 minutes away from our hotel, so after the softball games, we visited this location for dinner.   It was around 7pm and there were large groups of people waiting outside. My husband put our name on the wait list and the hostess told us it would be 45 minutes. My hungry group of five was a bit disappointed about the wait and the teens were contemplating taco bell. At this point, there was no way we were eating anywhere else. The long wait time just meant the food was promising. :)   Surprisingly, we were seated in 15 minutes! The restaurant looked BUSY, but the waiter was fast and kind. We sit down and there are 6 little cups of salsa. Right away, I love this. Not only was the salsa delicious, but they already knew to have several bowls!  It was a difficult choice to decide what to eat. Everything was reasonably priced and looked so good!!! But, I finally decided on the shrimp enchiladas. ($11.50) And I'm kind of disappointed I chose this.   As soon as a bit into the enchiladas I knew I was going to be sad. I live in California, and I knew I was going to probably never eat these amazing enchiladas again. They were incredibly tasty! The creamy enchilada sauce tasted like they could be drenched in pasta noodles and still taste amazing. It is so flipping fantastic! It was a fusion of Italian and Mexican food and it made my mouth so happy!   The other dishes looked just as yummy (Carne asada tacos, flautas, quesadillas) but I was too focused on the shrimp enchiladas!!!  Good bye Don Ruben's...you will definitely be missed.",

The chips and salsa are great, the food is even better. I've had tacos, chimichangas, pollo con queso, and tamales all of which were tasty and brought me back. Service is always on point as well.

    "text": "How I love Don Ruben's, let me count the ways.... I discovered this little Mexican restaurant a few months ago and have visited them an obscene amount of times since then. If you want some fabulous Americanized Mexican food, look no further. DR's offers tasty meals covered in cheese for ridiculously low prices in comparison to other similar restaurants (I'm not talking cheap like Taco Mich or something.... I'm talking about Macayo's or Carlos O'Brien or Manuels which don't hold a candle to this place and are way more expensive). Here's the deal.   1. Get the cheese crisp. Get the LARGE cheese crisp.... it's a dollar more and it is significantly bigger... you can take that puppy home and reheat it in the toaster oven to relive your Don Ruben's experience the next day (and I do). Their cheese crisp is so good....it's like they ouble fry it or something. The tortilla literally falls apart from being fried..... it is unlike other cheese crisps and, IMO, it's the best cheese crisp in town.   2. Get anything poco pollo style. ANYTHING. Essentially, their poco pollo is a burrito fundido with the jalapeno cream cheese and the cheddar cheese melted on a fried thing. I usually order an a la cart green or red (red is better, both are legit) chili burro poco pollo style. It is large, delicious, provides me with leftovers that are close to as tasty as the first time, and did I mention delicious....yes.   3. Don't bother with the rice..... their rice isn't that great. Also, their food probably has 1 trillion calories per serving, no need for extra carbs. You can save a lot of dollars by ordering a la cart items.   That's about it. I have also tried their tacos, enchiladas, taquitos, etc.... everything is good, but not as special as the items outlined above. Also, know that you will most likely wait in line when you go. I have never gotten in without a wait, even on a school night. Happy eating friends!!!",

This is more of the Americanized Mexican food and while it isn't that bad I can't really say that it was all that good.  I had the chimichanga platter which to be honest was ok. The meat was tasty (shredded beef) but that was it. The rice was not very good and it was mushy. The beans also did not taste good. The salsa had this fishy after taste. They only have one stall in the bathroom so if it's packed, good luck. The service was good and in all fairness the food was not that bad it just to me was not what I would consider Mexican. I personally feel that this place is ok and if you come with the expectation that you are not getting authentic Mexican food than you will like it. On a positive note they have coke products.",

I don't think this is the cheese that's typically put on tacos. The cheese is usually white, not yellow. This made it more Americanized imo. I asked for a spicier sauce to go with it and was surprised the green sauce was the spiciest because it wasn't spicy at all. They offered tobasco, but that doesn't go well with tacos; to me at least. The rice was very soft and went well with the entree. The bean soup was pretty good. I feel like there's way too many Mexican restaurants in the area for them to be priced so high.",

    "text": "I totally disagree with the one star review. Thats insane.  I'm a foodie and love a good mexican restaurant. I just moved here from Chicago and Don Ruben is a few blocks from me. I thought it was a hole in the wall dive, but I was wrong. It's clean and nicely decorated, with two rooms for patrons. The salsa is delicious, just the right amount of tomato, onion, spice and kick! I'm not a fan of the their hotter version, so I'd skip that. The chips are always fresh and hot. Great margaritas and even better at 3 bucks on weekends. I always get the shredded beef enchiladas with ranch beans. I've had this in numerous places and theirs is THE best. The sauce on the enchiladas is delicious. It's a full plate and enough for leftovers the next day. The deserts are amazing too. The wait staff is always friendly and quick! I love having this close to home, but there goes the diet!!!",

I had the Taco, rice and beans combo, my standard first plate at any Mexican food restaurant, which is my own personal test.  If said restaurant fails this test, I don't come back.  Guess what, Don Rubens failed pretty badly.    The food is total generic Mexican food.  The chips were slightly stale.  So was the taco shell, which by the way, seemed like they went across the street to Fry's for their ingredients.   The shell must have been the Kroger brand because it was pretty nasty.  Same with the rice and beans.  I felt the food definitely did not justify the prices.   The wait staff were not rude, but were definitely not welcoming or very attentive, and we seemed to wait a long while to both have our order taken, and have the food delivered.    I do not recommend Don Ruben's",

Of course most of the diners who eat here have no clue and they think it's just Mexican music.. Lol!",

Beers are super cold, incredible Margaritas and prices so reasonable they will make you want to drink more. Additionally they bring homemade tortilla chips and salsa that'll make you want to do the Salsa! Dance anyone?   The food is always received piping hot(please don't touch the plates) and tasting delicious. Did I mention the alcohol part? Ok. This particular time our service was taken care of by James who was attentive to all his tables. We never lacked or were in need of service because he made sure to ask before it became necessary. Wow! Another Margarita senor? Oui Monsieur! And keep em' coming!   Ordered the taquitos for myself as an appetizer. Crunchy and beefy good! The Chile Colorado plate (yes i touched it anyway) came with beans n rice. This was my main course of course! Will order again next time. Next time coming!  Tips: have been here on Friday or Saturday and there is always a crowded wait time. Arrive at 5:30pm you'll be fine. Arrive at 5:33pm, you'll be on a waiting list. Parking never a problem as it is in a strip mall.  Also, very easy for Uber to find.  As always, thanks for reading =)   Will be back to enjoy",

The service was good and the food was good as well, it is just a little too far for us, and it did not really blow our minds to keep coming to a place that is far and crowded.

This is very much a good American/Mexican restaurant & after seeing all the 5 star reviews, that was a let down that it was definitely not authentic & True Mexican food.   The chips & salsa seemed to be packaged & very generic. We'd swear they were Tostitos & Pace, however, you do get the authentic style chips when you order a hot dip app. We ordered the Fiesta app which was a mix of beans with jalapeno cream cheese & we enjoyed that. For the meal we ordered a taco/tostada/enchilada combo plate which was good but disappointingly bland, no flavor or spice at all. The cheese enchilada was very good, but I'd stay away from combo plates & just order that alone. Now on the other hand, we also ordered the shrimp burro & that was amazing! Full of grilled, roasted flavor, very juicy, it was certainly delicious & we'd highly recommend it.  We did enjoy the warm friendly atmosphere, the candlelit tables, the efficiency of the staff in managing a very crowded, busy restaurant with very short wait & lots of attentiveness. The customer service is very exceptional from everyone there. We do plan on coming here again but will continue to look for more authentic Mexican cooking in the area.",

Parking is decent. Come here if you want a local restaurant that isn't a chain near a shopping mall.",

Ordered our food but took about 30 to 45 min to get it and eat it by that time most of us were full off the chips and salsa. The Spicer one reminds me of a red enchilada sauce blended with some spicy peppers.The flour chips were a hit with the guacamole (salty). I ordered a cheese enchilada and chili relleno al la cart with a side of rice as you cannot sub any combinations to make this combo. It was super hot appreciate the freshness and not something thrown together like warm. Once it cooled down it was so salty I could feel my blood pressure spike sky high. The carnitas plate was ordered it was mixed with onions and peppers on top hardly any meat on the plate. The taco and enchilada combo was okay the shredded beef had no flavor tho.  If your looking for a good mexican resturant do not eat here after my salty food I've been in and out if the restroom constantly. Just go for the margaritas.",

    "text": "The only reason they get 2 stars is because the Cadillac margarita is delicious. However the strawberry daquari (?) seemed to have needed some actual liquor in it  Came here in Saturday night and was very disappointed.  Carne asada was chewy and dry.  Hubby ordered the Carmen asada burro (pollo Poco style) and it came to the table with nothing on it. We looked for the waiter and he was no where to be found. He finally came to the table and took the meal back to the kitchen to have it completed. Which meant hubby had to wait for his food again before eating with the rest of us.  Waiter didn't come back with drink or chip refills.  Again, if I ever come back here again it would only be for the margarita and only the Cadillac over at that. But that's not the only reason why I go to a Mexican restaurant, I want good food.  This was neither the place for good food or good service. I'll be looking for another favorable restaurant.",

I had 2 cheese and chicken enchiladas with green sauce, rice and beans for $10.95. The salsas and food aren't spicy which I like.

Beef taco was a little sub-par compared to other local joints, chips were great but salsa was very average. Atmosphere was small, quaint, cozy, nice and traditional (playing mexican music)...which was a nice relief from other large Mexican chain restaurants. I know a good Mexican restaurant when I see one, and Dons is better than good. My only regret is that I didn't discover Dons earlier. I will be back to try other menu options as I know they will be excellent.",

We had the carne asada dinner, pork carnitas, a margarita, and a Chile relleno.   Not only was the food amazing but they have the best staff ever. They were all so kind and even gave our children lollipops when they started to act up. Such a family-friendly restaurant with amazing service and great food!

I love that they have vegan options too, like the bean chimichanga (as well as a few other vegan menu items that I can't quite recall at the moment).  The fact that Don Ruben's has some vegan options for me and then some meat-themed options for my husband means that we can enjoy a wonderful meal together!

    "text": "Totally underwhelming Mexican food.  Even Macayo's and Chipotle burritos have cost less with bigger portions, and tasted better.  I ordered a simple rice, bean and guacamole ($6.95) burrito for lunch.  I mean, how hard can that be to MESS up?    But they piled some warm slimy goop (frijoles, I imagine) in a tortilla and called it done.  I have heard this location has been several other ill-fated restaurants before.  Let's hope this one can stay a while.  Lunch service was slower than expected - only 2 servers but with 10 parties.  Their signature dish was the poco pollo - basically a chicken chimi with heart clogging jalapeno cream cheese - a standard dish at most Mexican eateries.  Might be worth it - who knows? The inside decor is nice a warm modern Mexican look, but with booths and cheap tables/chairs throughout.  They also serve tequila and margaritas yet have NO BAR.  WTF?",

Since Ive moved here which wasnt too long ago, I always order cheese enchiladas with rice and whole beans (if I can find them) and a fish taco on the side. The fish taco was seasoned and fried to perfection. It reminded of what I got from back home growing up. The fact they have whole beans (here for some reason in arizona they call em ranchero versus charro or borracho beans which what I call em) are one of the reasons I  love this place. Being able to mix my rice and beans is as good as it gets with a pacifico. The cheese enchiladas I had were also tasty. The sauce was very tex mex and made it that much better. I have been there 3 times now and the place just keeps getting better.",

I am a fourth generation AZ. native, been eating Mexican food in Phx. area for years,  There are other good places, but we like Don Ruben's the best.

The food is just okay, but the margaritas and guacamole are very good. That's the main reason to go. I've had two BIG problems with this place. First, they take reservations but don't honor them when you show up. We had a reservation, but when we showed up (on time), they simply put our name at  the bottom of the waiting list. And then told me that's how they do things. We left and didn't return for about 8 months. Second problem came when I took my mom there for lunch. I ordered the taco plate, bit in and broke a tooth on the taco shell, which was NOT fresh. It was hard as a rock and yet gummy, like a stale shell had been steamed. First time I'd had a problem with freshness here, but it was an expensive problem. Anyway that was 4 months ago and I won't go back.",

    "text": "I'm baffled at how poorly rated this place is. I just ate here for the first time and loved it. I was there with a large party of people. We sat down with fresh chips and salsa being put on the table, our drink orders were taken almost right away, and the food came out unexpectedly quickly given our group size.  First thing when we sat down, the owner came out to say hi and check on us. I would certainly not call that poor service. The waiter was good humored and rolled with our jokes.  I don't know what people have been getting that causes them to say the food is alright at best. I had the mexican shrimp burro and I can honestly say it was, by far, the best mexican food I have ever had, and very filling. Sure, the beans and rice are nothing to call home about but, let's face it, how many restaurants have you been to where the beans and rice were phenomenal? However, one person in our party ordered pinto beans instead of the standard refried beans, and they looked delicious. Other people in our party also really enjoyed their special grilled salmon and the salmon tacos.  It's disappointing that this place has such a low overall rating, because that means most people won't even check to see if there is a good review. If anyone does though, please just go try it for yourself. And for the people who have had coupon issues: Yes, it sucks that they didn't honor your coupon but I ALWAYS ask if a place will accept the coupon before I just order, assuming they will. So it's really not fair to just write a place off because of a coupon issue. But hey, that's your loss.  EDIT: I just checked out the \"filtered\" reviews... for whatever reason, that's where all the 5 star reviews went. Which would explain why they have such a poor rating.",

The refried beans were decent, but our shredded beef hard tacos had a hint of fish taste (likely shared the frier with a future fish taco). The Poco Pollo sounded awesome but was super dry and really needed a sauce of some sort.  Our server was attentive and fast (he brought some beans out for our toddler right away), and he was juggling a few large tops.

Drink orders taken right after chips and salsa served. Chips were light and crisp. \"Hot\" sauce wasn't hot, too bad. Salsa had good flavor.  Carne asada fajitas and carnitas was our order. Service was not rushed. Proteins for both were a bit overcooked. Spices were very flavorful. Portions were reasonable and pricing was very fair.  Churro bowl for dessert. Only $4.95. An OK value.

I had a chicken taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. It was one of their lunch specials and pretty reasonably priced.

I wanted spinach enchilada and relleno combo , but could not . I would have been charged for each and beans and rice .. There was no plate option . Relleno by itself and if u want beans and rice extra for it . Approximately 10 $ for the plate . Pretty pricy for Glendale AZ .",

This place was a go-to place for us for a long time, however, we have noticed these 'changes' occurring slowly over a relatively short period of time.   With quite a few quality restaurants offering just as good - and better - fare and ambiance available in the surrounding area, this place just isn't the over the top place it once was.  A substantial change in quality and taste in their food combined with a 'blah' sort of atmosphere permeating the room has led us to explore other restaurants that appeal more to what we had come to enjoy here in the past.   I'm being very nice here, out of respect.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen.",

Wife and I sat there and haven't even gotten our drink orders in. We've been here in the past and never had this issue.

Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. Located in an unattractive strip mall, this restaurant is a hidden gem. My highest recommendation.",

I can't understand why someone would leave a bad review. And the complaint on the bad review was stupid so stfu. The staff here is amazing. They are always welcoming, attentive and consistent. Our salsa and chips are never empty and the food comes out fast. Also, our drinks are always filled. And they have great tea! Being from new mexico I am super picky about my Mexican food and this is the only Mexican food I will eat in arizona. It's just so damn good. I am most fond of the Mexican shrimp burrito but have tried about a dozen other things and everything has been 100%. The gf always gets something different so she can try the whole menu so we have tried a lot of different things and are constantly impressed. I'd like to give DR 10 stars. Try it, you will Not be disappointed.",

Dine4AZ isn't a fake coupon site. But that's what he said when he decided he didn't want to take the coupon. Seriously?? And the coupon? For a free cheese crisp with purchase of an entree. Oh yea - and we had a party of 30 PEOPLE. Won't ever go back being treated like that.",

The service was adequate, but they did get one of my party's order incorrect.  He did get his plate replaced rather quickly, but it was a simple red/green burrito mix-up.  The hostess/waitress's breath was KICKIN!  IT was a serious problem!  They have a giant bowl of mints by the door, I really wish she had taken full advantage of that.  And while her service was attentive, she brought drinks out like no body's business, we really didn't want her coming to our table.  It was really bad.  I would probably not come here again.",
