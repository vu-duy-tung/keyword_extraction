The owner is always friendly as well. I love their grilled chicken pita and fresh cut fries. The coneys are great as well. The quality and prices are fantastic, but it's the wonderful staff that keeps us coming back.",

We met Dave while out some months ago and he said to come check him out after noticing our boys in their respective Tigers and Lions gear. It took us awhile, but we finally made it in and now I'm wishing we had gone sooner!  When you first walk in, you're greeted like family! Dave was so warm and welcoming and even the guys working the grill were great. He came and migled with all his guests and knew MANY on a first name basis. Before leaving we exchanged hugs after showing him what I wrote on FB about his Vernor's float (its AMAZING and I would've never thought to try it)!!  The food speaks for itself. I was sure I would need a second helping but barely made it through my coney and fries (which was enough for two people). Prices are considerably decent and we will be back often.   We live near Dobson and Main and I can almost guarantee good business at Mesa Riverview where the new Cub's Stadium is.   Thanks for making our experience a memorable one and we WILL see you all soon!",

I don't like chili but the chili here was so good, more of a meatsauce with middle eastern flair. The hot dog was mild and the cheese sauce on it was so good. My boyfriend got a triple burger and loved every bite. Glad to see a place that is so good and that really cares about what customers think.",

    "text": "Finally an AUTHENTIC Detroit CONEY restaurant in Arizona.    After I left Michigan back in 2005, I thought that I would never have this experience ever again, unless I went home to visit.  But Detroit Coney brought the actual Coney experience to me....and I couldn't be happier.  The Hani is exactly how I remember it...and the chili is the real thing!  (I may be wrong, but I think they ship it in from Detroit....)   The best part, besides the food....is that I am with all of my Michigan peeps when I am there.  There is always somebody to gossip with about Michigan....and in the end it comes to be known that we either know each other or we know the same people.  It is so much fun.  Do NOT go to any other places in AZ that claim to be a Coney Restaurant.  They aren't.  You need the Middle Eastern flair along with it, btw.  And bring your non-MI friends....they will thank you forever for it.",

My husband and I got the hanis, chili dog and chili cheese fries with Rock & Rye obviously!  Everything was just how we remembered it to be.  Oh and BTW  to all the cheapy reviewers I could not care less if they charge $2.50 for a Faygo.  If you can't afford $2.50 then you shouldn't be going out to eat in the first place, this isn't a soup kitchen it's a restaurant if you don't want to pay the price drink water, kay?  The owner and his staff are super nice and all from MI - I would expect nothing less.  If you are from MI and miss the Coney Island staples check this place out you won't be disappointed...if you're not then try it for the first time, it's worth it.",

We had almost every item b/c we are a family of \"6\" so we tried the burgers, coneys, pitas, and the salad...  The chicken salad was great we actually saw the cook pull it out from the marinade & grill it right in front of us!  It was tender & very flavorful!  The addition of beets to the salad was great as was the homemade dressing.  My 15 year old son had two trike burgers...he's an endless pit.  The chicken & gyros pitas were great as well.  Their taziki sauce was tangy & scrumptious.  The Coney had the perfect snap with the right amt of condiments!   The family tried for the first time a \"loose\" meat dog.  Wow!  It turned out to be one of our favorites.  Now the fries!  They cut them right on the spot and reminded us of our mom's homemade fries.  We vote for the next DCG to be in Gilbert near the 202.  It was great getting to know Dave.  It great to see/hear the passion one can have for \"home.\"  We will definitely be back & can't wait for the new place!",

    "text": "Best thing to come out of Detroit since Robocop.  This new fast-casual burger and dog joint looks like it might as well be a seasoned chain, but it's a new concept in a formerly failing strip. This and the neighboring restaurant, Hummus Xpress, have resurrected this location from the dead.   The food here is fantastic. Everything seems fresh and high quality. Even though the prices are fast-food low, you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck. The owner is pretty nice and has a lot of experience running local restaurants. He's usually there and he is very proud (as he should be) of his place and happy to tell you all about what you're eating and how they grind their own meat for the burger patties. That's always a good sign for me - an owner and staff who give a shit about their restaurant.   I ate a double cheeseburger with bacon and avocado and paired it with some curly fries. It was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley. If you're a big fan of In and Out Burger or Five Guys, you should really give this place a try because it's not only better, it blows those places away. You can get your burger topped with just about whatever you want, and after you order you can watch them disassemble a whole potato and toss it in some hot oil for you.   Don't be intimidated or discouraged if you see a long line out the door at lunchtime because it moves really fast, and the register is up near the door so that's gonna happen. Rumor has it that they might start offering delivery soon after lunch. Makes me wish I lived a little closer. With the kind of detail and thought that went into this concept, they might have plans to open more locations eventually - looking forward to that.",

Lafayette, American and Angelo's have been rated at or near the top of this type of dogs for MANY years.Not just in Michigan, but throughout the U.S. . I ate a lot these dogs since I was a kid.   These young guys have really done their homework. Great stuff and I enjoy their enthusiastic attitude toward their work! The dogs are of the natural-skin variety that really pop when you bite into them. The coney sauce has the kind of taste that I've dreamed of for some time now.  The last time I attended the N.Y. State Fair in Syracuse I discovered that a \"coney island\" was a grayish  dog and what I knew as a coney was called a \"Michigan Red Hot.\" So the history of this food belongs to the \"Mitten State.\"  Note: for the first time in my life I ordered a hamburger at a coney place. The boys grind their own meat and the burger was beyond belief. I enjoyed it much better than a couple I've had for $11 in some much fancier places.Theirs  costs $2.95.

    "text": "Temporary fix for a Midwest staple. I've been here in Arizona for a little over 5 years . Moving from Detroit I stayed eating at a Coney Island at least one meal of the day. So when I heard of the Detroit coney grill I was very excited, an to find out that they were getting their chilli from one of the best if not oldest coneys in Detroit, made it Mir appealing. When I told my wife that there was a coney in the valley we decided to check it out. When we made if to the location I knew I was in the right place. Several people leaving the place with their Detroit tigers fitted I felt at home for a quick second. The vibe inside was nice, some photos on the wall of certain Michigan team an a few other things Detroit. So now we get to the food which is really the reason that we came. Unlike most of the other people who have given reviews I was somewhat unimpressed by the menu as well as pricing an hours. Understand this, I am Detroit in every way shape an form. I've said on many occasions that if there were a coney out here that was exactly how we have them back home you would have a winner. Although the food is nice here, it's menu is missing so much that would make this a great place to go. I don't want to just go to a spot because its reminds me somewhat of home. And I think that this is what's happening with this place. So many people from Michigan have moved out here to the valley that anytime that you hear of anything from home you want to check it out. Coneys are a 24/7 grill with sooooo much to choose from on the menu you sometimes stand at the counter trying hard to make a decision on what to get. Burgers an coney fries are nice however just a scratch of the surface. And 2 bucks for a faygo is highway robbery, especially when you can go to certain qts or circle k's an get a 20 oz for 1 buck. The guy told us that they charge that much because it cost so much to send them out here. I know some may see this as a raggin rant, however it's not. In order to stand the test of time with a business you have to look at everything your patrons are saying an try to make adjustments. If not that same thing can turn around and bite you. Hopefully this is just a start to a great establishment in the valley. I'll be back to see if anything has changed. #whatupdoe",

My favorite were the fries. They make them fresh right there and you can really tell. The owner was friendly and welcoming, and all of the staff was helpful and had smiles.

I deferred to my wife on the quality of the food as she has eaten many times at Lafayette and American Coney in Detroit.   She felt the chili was lacking in spices and the burger meat was bland as well.  The fries seemed to be too dark brown in color, not sure if the cooking oil needs changing?  There was a placard on the table asking for feedback on expanding to new locations.  I concurred with my wife's assessment of the meat and chili, but also observed that the restaurant can use more attention to cleaning and could also use some touch-up painting.   The food was not bad, but does need tweeked slightly.  management should focus on setting standards for quality of the food as well as cleanliness of the facility before rxpanding.  We do wish them well in their endeavors.",

For those yearning for Detroit coneys, or like me, curious about what one is like after seeing them on TV, Detroit Coney Grill has exactly what you are looking for.  The menu consists of burgers, hot dogs, pitas, and salads, with some chicken and 3 vegetarian options. I decided on a Detroit coney. The hot dog had a nice \"bite\" to it from the slightly elastic casing, adding a nice textural difference from the rest of the hot dog. The chili was somewhat reminiscent of some Cincinnati style chili I've had from Skyline Chili, except with more of a savory flavor to it. It went well with the onion, mustard, and hot dog.   Service was excellent, and the owner was very friendly and came by to make sure everything was tasting OK.  Hours are a bit limited for those that tend to dine later in the evening since they close at 7:30. Overall though, a great place for some inexpensive quick eats.",

We were especially impressed with the fresh cut fries and bottle drinks made with old school cane sugar. This place is where to go to celebrate an occasion, or to even to relieve lonliness. The service is polite and efficient, and the workers all seem to care very much for their tasks at hand, almost as if they were serving a higher purpose.

The owner was nice/friendly and proud - And I love seeing that sort of sincere passion with someone and their business...it Carries over into their food!    The coney was about as legit as it gets too. A Detroit Coney is a bit more savory than other coneys...which can be Good but different. Anyway, a True coney isn't for everyone...but, in my humble opinion everyone should try one! :)-  This guy has nailed it - bringing Phoenix a nice little piece of Detroit - the good part :).",

    "text": "What is a \"Coney Dog?\", you ask.  \"Definitely not a chili dog\" is what has been told to me.  A real Michigan Coney Dog has an all-beef casing hot dog grilled to perfection and placed in a steamed bun.  This hot dog is topped with, and this is where it gets the distinction from a chili dog, an all meat chili, onions and mustard.    Since I LOVE to try the most I can in one order... I ordered a \"Combo Coney Dog\".  This is the Coney dog I described above (I got my onions grilled) with \"Loose\" meat on top of the hot dog.  What's \"loose meat\"?  Well, that's just grilled ground beef crumbled up...  They put the loose meat on top of the hot dog and then put the all meat chili on top of that.  Just dang delicious.  I really liked the taste of the hot dog itself.   Not to be out done by the hot dog, the fries here are fantastic.  I litterally watched the chef cut the potato and put the curly fries in the fryer.  The fries are just that fresh.  Oh, by the way, they grind their own meat daily for their hamburgers.  I stopped in Coney Grill to have a Faygo pop and to try the hot dog.  I grew up drinking Faygo pops when I was a kid.  Grape being my favorite flavor.  Detroit Coney Grill has Faygo pops in the bottle.  There is something about the taste of a soda out of a bottle that makes it taste 1000 times better.  I savored every cold, sweet sip.  I like this place.  I'm going back.  I'm taking some of my ex-Detroit family when they come in town.  Yummy.  This place is great!  Get there early, they close a little bit early.",

Never had been here before but decided to try it out, and I ended up getting the daily meal; drink, two hot dogs, and fries. Fries were unsalted, hot dogs were too chewy, and I didn't get my drink.

    "text": "Seriously, when I walk through the front door of Detroit Coney Grill, I feel like I am back in Detroit. From the smells, the tastes, the menu offerings and everyone's friendly demeanor, from the staff to the patrons. They need a sign on the wall when you walk in that says. \"If You're From Detroit, Welcome Home!\"  I'm originally from Oak Park, Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) and two of the things I miss the most are the food and the general kindness with which people treat each other there. Found out the owner (Dave? David?) is also from Oak Park (and used to live about 5 blocks from where I used to live!). They have regular hot dogs there and they have Coney's. The Coney is a hot dog with a natural casing, so it 'snaps' when you bite into it. My wife and I have driven to the famous Pink's hotdogs in Hollywood and had great chili dogs there, and this place stacks right up against them in every way!  The coney's are amazing. The fries are made just the way I make them at home myself. The people that work there and eat there are all very friendly and love to talk about reminiscing where we're all from and if you remember this place or that place back in the day back home (Detroit).  What a great place! Good prices, hours are kinda weird (closes at 7:30pm on weekdays and closed on Sundays) and it can be a little difficult to find as its smashed into the middle of a crowded strip mall with a medical marijuana license distributor a few stores down.  We made the trip from Glendale to try this place out and I was so impressed! I wish it was closer! But I predict I'll be making the drive again soon - and often! (Update - I've been there four times now and it seems like it just keeps getting better every time I go. Food is consistently great and people are consistently friendly and the service is consistent as well).  Loved having Vernor's in the glass bottle, and looking forward to trying the burgers next time, as well. (Update - we tried the sliders, which are a menu option only offered on certain days - they were amazing!)  They also just started offering Boston Coolers on the menu on Friday's and Saturday's. For those who don't know or remember, a Boston Cooler is Vernors blended with French Vanilla ice cream (almost like a root beer float). It is so good - and if you've never had one, I guarantee it tastes like nothing else you've ever had (in a good way!).  Trivia - Why is it called a Boston Cooler when it's from Detroit? It was named after Detroit's Boston Boulevard where it was reportedly first served. The history of the Boston Cooler has some conflicts. One story says that Mr. Sanders invented the drink at his store on the east side of Woodward Ave near Boston Blvd. The other story, and the one I like better, is that the drink was invented during Prohibtion by Grandpa Vernor for his grandchildren. According to legend, there was a milk man who delivered to the Vernor household. In his wagon he carried Strohs Ice Cream (Strohs had to give up brewing beer and changed their fire-brewed kettles over to ice cream production). James Vernor Sr. lived on Grosse isle but would visit the grandkids in Detroit. During one summer visit in 1921 the milkman and Grandpa Vernor delevoped a friendship and between the two of them they concocted the mixture of Strohs vanilla ice cream and Vernors Ginger Ale. It was called a Boston Cooler because the house was on Boston Blvd.  Detroit Coney Grill is a great place! Highly Recommended! Hidden Gem!!!  Also, I just learned they are getting ready to open another location on the west side of town (maybe 35th Ave and Bell Road?) That's a lot closer to my house, so I'm sure I will be eating there more often!  Disclaimer - I am not an investor, I did not know anyone who works there or runs the place (though I am getting to know them) nor do I have anything to gain (or lose) by posting this review.",

I used to go to the Lafayette Coney Island on my lunch breaks back in the day, so I can honestly tell you that Detroit Coney Grill's coney dogs taste the same! The owner and his staff were very friendly and I really enjoyed being there albeit kind of small. I will definitely be bringing my family here. I live in Chandler so maybe one day he'll open a location closer to me. Very happy to see Faygo pop too!",

I have been living \"out West\" for 12 years now, and have been on a mission to have a great Greek salad or gyro ever since.  I have tried a Greek salad at probably hundreds of restaurants (cheap and expensive) and they've never tasted quite right.  FINALLY! This is the Greek salad I've been craving!!!  Finally! This is the gyro I have been looking for!  My boyfriend proclaimed this the best gyro he's ever had, and I'd have to say it's at least the best I've ever had outside of Michigan.  At least.  I've also had the coney dogs and the chili cheese fries.  Of the 4 people I've brought with me on two visits, everyone was impressed.  The food is excellent, and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  They know they are a new restaurant, and they want to earn your business!  Let them!  Finally, in glancing at some other reviews, don't think you can only enjoy this place if you're from Michigan.  We're just happy to have a place with the word Detroit in it, but you'll enjoy this place if you like to eat, period.  Grab a group of friends and check it out!",

The hot dogs were just as good, if not better, than what you get back home.  And the 'Hani' was better than most in Michigan.  The owner (Dave?) was very welcoming and passionate about the business.  Overall, great experience.  They surely brought Pure Michigan to the Valley.",

The owner is so proud of his business, and it's nice to see. I told him I'd be back since I work so close and he was honest that call in orders around lunch time are a no go since they're just so busy, but that it moves quick and not to be discouraged by a line. The honesty is refreshing for sure. He also was honest with my family of 4 and told us we all didn't need our own order of fries; that one or two would be plenty.   I can't wait to see this place flourish, and I'm thrilled for the addition of desserts that the owner mentioned will be coming.",

With 3 patties you are only looking at 6 ounces total of meat.  I want to come back and try it with four patties.  Can't wait!   Also, what makes this burger so tasty is the meat patty is ground daily and not ever frozen.  That's the niche of this place!",

Topped with chili and cheese and chopped white onions, it's exactly the same stuff that I've gotten from the coney shops in the Detroit area.  Trust me that one hot dog and one order of chili cheese fries is more than enough for one person. The fries are hand cut and fried almost to order. The dogs are topped and ready in moments.  Of course, you also have to get a Faygo to drink with it. Faygo is a Detroit soda brand. I enjoyed my Faygo Vanilla Creme that tasted a lot like Dr. Brown's Cream Soda.  Service was friendly. The place is clean. And it's an inexpensive meal. I got a laugh out of the Ohio State doormat at the counter where you're encouraged to wipe your feet.",

From the greet at the door (no explanation needed of the menu when you're from Detroit)  His daughter Lilly made sure that the place was cleaned, grabbed our trays as soon as we were done and wiped off all the tables. The owner personally stopped at every table talking to newcomers and regulars alike.   They have all the original faygo flavors in glass bottles so they have a great crisp flavor. Not mention every flavor of a better made chips. I was a little sad that they didn't have my red pop but the owner assured me he order it and the guy that ships it dropped the ball (I saw the text message)  The food was phenomenal- Fiance got the quad burger with regular fries and devoured it, I ordered the veggie pita with tzatziki sauce and the Cajun fries (no ketchup needed). The only thing that could make this meal better is a nap!   Which is exactly what we are headed to do! We will definitely be back! Great job brining a taste of Detroit to the desert! Can't wait til they bring a location to the south side 32nd and baseline would be perfect",

The wife and I went here for lunch this past Monday and when I walked in I IMMEDIATELY loved the place. Dave was wearing a Detroit Lions shirt.....another staff member was wearing a Tigers Visor.....and we showed some mad love to each other over that thrilling comeback by the Lions over the Dallas Cowgirls.  Enough about that though let me talk about the food.....first of all since I don't eat red meat.....I decided to try there buffalo chicken pita. Let me tell you people it was the BEST buffalo chicken I have EVER tasted. I mean it was soooooo goood because they use Franks Hot Sauce and that makes all the difference in the world. Now for those of you who haven't spent anytime in the Midwest there are 3 things you must try if you ever visit that part of the country.  Franks Hot Sauce Better Made Potato Chips Faygo Soda Pop  They sell all of these items at the Detroit Coney Grill.....I was truly in heaven on Earth. This is establishment has been open for only a couple of months.....but I am really hoping Dave can get a spot open over here in the East Valley. So I need all of my fellow yelpers to pay Dave a visit in Tempe.....enjoy the food.....even if your not a Detroit sports fan.....LOL!!!! Then get your fannies back here on YELP and show Dave and the Detroit Coney Grill some love so we can get one here in the East Valley......wohooooo!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

Being from Texas & living in Arizona I've never had a real Faygo until today. We got 3 different ones to try and they were all tasty.   The coney dogs come on a soft steamed bun with a snappy dog, mustard & onions. The hand cut fries are tasty, especially seasoned and chili & cheese added.   This is a don't miss spot!",

To begin, when you walk in, there's a cool map on the wall of Michigan (and if you're from there, you vs. place a pin on the map according to the city you're from) Dave, the owner, is a very welcoming guy. The dude KNOWS how to run a business. He loves all of his guests. Such a Detroit kind of guy! But down to the main topic- Food. Absolutely incredible. It's JUST like being back home. They serve Faygo pop and Better Made potato chips, too! I'm impressed that they were able to bring something so sacred to Michiganers here to Arizona (And pull it off successfully!)

It's basically a chili dog served with or without onions and covered in a specific type of chili that tends to be a little less meaty and a little more watery than you get in places like Texas. Other Michigan specific items include Better Made Potato Chips and it wouldn't be a fair representation of the Wolverine state if you couldn't wash it all down with a Vernor's Ginger Ale or a Faygo pop.

As well they should be. Their dogs are awesome, with that *snap* you look for in a good coney, made from real meat (no \"lips and assholes\", as my partner puts it). I had a burger the last time I was in, and it was damn good. The patties are small, 2-3 oz, which is why their burgers come in double, triple, quadruple, etc sizes. The only complaint I had was that my bun ended up kind of soggy within a few minutes, which is a pet peeve of mine. The fresh cut fries are great, and you can throw toppings like chili and cheese on them.   If you're looking for a good, authentic Coney Dog, with some Faygo Red Pop to go along with it, this is your place! It's definitely our go-to hot dog joint now.",

The food is fantastic. I am very picky about beef and chicken. At home I always buy round or chuck steaks and have them grind it fresh and I always cook it the same day. Well I don't know what these guys are doing, but their beef is consistently high quality and tastes as good as the fresh ground steaks I use. A lot of places, even the fancy grass fed places... their beef tastes old and rancid to me. Again I'm very picky but that's what I often taste. Not at Detroit coney grill. Their stuff tastes fresh and delicious every single time. The staff is also solid. They are always polite and work fast to get my food out. I like all kinds of food from street tacos to fine dining, and the burgers at this place are one of my absolute favorites. The great service is an added bonus. For drinks they have one of those coke machines where you can make what you want. They have a tv and the place is always clean. Besides burgers I've had their chicken pitas and everything was good. Even their ketchup is good! I don't know what other places do to make their ketchup sour. I assume they just leave it out too long.  It not here.  Seriously I don't know what the owner/management secret is because usually even good places make mistakes. But these guys are consistently awesome. Kudos.",

And as soon as the owner left with an order, the guys behind the counter were talking about working for him and spent more time talking to each other how miserable their boss is.   Received a message from the owner, who was very professional in his reply. Easy to see why his business is a success, he obviously cares enough to reach out. Hats off to the owner and best wishes for continued success!",

I ordered one of their specials which was the double coney chili cheese dogs with everything on them. I chose the spreadable cheese and it was magical! I also was able to choose onion rings instead of the fries that comes with the meal. I was able to steal some of my wife's fries so it worked out just nice lol. I was impressed with the batter on the onion rings and over all was satisfied with my choice of lunch although I will have to go back and try a burger next time thanks to the recommendation of David.   My wife had the cheesesteak pita and fries which was also very delicious and full of flavor. It has a little bit of a kick that is subtle and tasty. The fries taste fresh and we were very happy with our decision to try this place out. Will definitely be returning in the future!   Thanks!",

I haven't tried the chili dogs yet but that's next on my list.  These guys grind their own meat for their burgers and they also have hand cut fries.  Everything I've eaten here is delicious.  I am not usually one to jump on the idea of getting burgers because I'm really picky with red meat being under cooked but this place has fabulous burgers and they're never under cooked.  Burger patties are thin so I usually get a triple and it's the perfect size. Looking forward to getting lunch here again tomorrow!",

No.   I'm here because there are two days of the year when I honor my dad by going out and enjoying the best hot dog I can find - his birthday, and the anniversary of the day he passed away. Today is the latter. Being that he was also from Detroit, and this place seemed to have good reviews, we gave it a shot. What a huge mistake. 3 orders of chicken fingers, all of which were so overcooked they were inedible strips of rubber. I ordered the Detroit Coney combo, which was supposed to be a chili dog with loose meat. Not only was it cold when I got it, but there was NO hot dog. When I returned it, she chuckled that the other lady made me the wrong thing, then picked up a hot dog that had been sitting on the grill Lord knows how long, threw it on a bun, scooped chili (which also turned out to be ice cold) on top and gave that to me. Also NOT what I ordered. At this point I gave up. The fries were greasy and limp, and the whole meal was a bust. Never again. There DO happen to be a lot of great place in this strip mall, though, so do yourself a favor and walk past this one.  I'm out $47 on an already crappy day. Save your money.",

The owner David greeted me with a smile and a push pin to put on a map of Detroit to say where I was from. I ordered a faygo red, two bags of better made red hot chips cause there is no other chips like them. A coney dog with grilled onions and chilli chesse fries. The coney dog was good but not over flowing as you would get back home where it was mandatory to eat your coney dog with a fork. I was able to pick up my dog and eat it with it Going all over my fingers, which is a part of a great coney dog. I do want to try the curly fries that they make right in front of you and maybe a burger.  I do have to say that I had walked by a guy eating a double burger and the look on his face was that of pure bliss. The owner David casually walked among his customers and I casually ask for a picture. He did not hesitate in obligeing me. We went outside and took a pic in front of his eatery's logo. Overall, absolutely a place to go eat. Ground meat is made right there and looked delicious.  I was ok with my coney dog and chilli chesse fries but in think I was more jazzed about having a faygo red. Even as I was walking out the door I got a I really hope you enjoyed the food. Great atmosphere.  Next to try burger and red hot fries.",

I assumed things about their cheese, and as it isn't my favorite they are more particular about their quality than I ever could expect. I learned that the cheese is local, a fact that I love, and made by Shrieber Cheese. But enough about the cheese - the final compilation is still a tasty burger. And i have enjoyed it.   I have come back a few times and at first it against my vote, but I fell for single majority. I had to give them a second third and a fourth chance and they have started to grow on me. I do still favor the the burger over the dog. That has not changed.   My hat is off for the persistence and the corrections. After each review I have been contacted by the owner, not requesting me to changed my review but correcting my wrongful assumptions and guesswork, and having a decent attitude while doing so. For this I am truly impressed, this is the way to go and the way to treat your customers. this is the kind of business I want to support.",

That said, I do enjoy good food, though, and the food was good, no complaints, but it just didn't seem all that special to me. I can get good dogs and burgers at other places too, so apart from the focus on Detroit, or Michigan in general, there really isn't much about this place to draw me, as a non-Detroiter, back again.

Every bit as delicious and tasty as Lafayette or American's coneys. Wash it down with a Faygo Rock n Rye or Redpop interspersed with some BetterMaid chips and with the airfare I save from flying from Sky Harbour to Metro Airport, I can indulge frequently.  Perhaps Detroit Coney Grill can get a beer/wine license and serve up a cold fire brewed Stroh's.  Looking forward to a north valley location closer to my Anthem home.  Detroit Coney Grill rocks!",

David is a great PR man but those chili cheese coneys didn't really need any PR. Great homemade chili and dogs with just the right amount of snap. We definitely need one of these restaurants in the West Valley! (Maybe on Bell Road off the 101 Loop? Or better yet, 67th Avenue off of the 101 Loop? Hint, hint David!)",

The owner Dave is colorful, approachable, and loves to greet his customers and he makes sure personally that your order was higher than expected.

    "text": "Detroit Coney Grill  930 W Broadway Rd Tempe, AZ 85282 (480) 219-7430  When you first walk up to Detriot Coney Grill it looks like a little hole in the wall restaurant that could be risky to eat at.  It is located on the side of the road in a little shopping center on Broadway in Tempe and when I first drove past it I was a little skeptical of trying it out.  When you walk into the restaurant it has that traditional Coney dog restaurant atmosphere with basic tables and a clear window cover to the kitchen so you can see the workers making your food fresh with the smell of meats grilling and chili simmering.  The walls on the inside are covered in Detroit sports memorabilia and old newspaper articles along with some Ford and car industry pictures.  They completely nailed the ambience and atmosphere of a traditional Coney restaurant in Detroit and it made me feel like I was back visiting Michigan.   I am a huge Coney dog fan because all of my family is from Michigan and when I visit every year it feels like all we do is eat at different Coney dog places in Detroit so I decided to see how well this little place in Tempe was able to replicate a traditional Coney dog.  I ordered the lunch special which is two Coney dogs with a side of chili cheese fries which was really well priced at 9 nine dollars for the amount of food that you get.  The hot dog itself was amazing because they used Kowalski hot dogs, just like they do in Detroit, which snap when you take a bite out of it.  Their chili was just like the traditional style of Coney dog chili with no beans and not super chunky while also being able to replicate the same great taste with the use of spices and simmering technique.  The fries were deep fried to perfection providing a nice and crunchy outside so when the chili and cheese is thrown on top they don't get soggy.  All together they made the best Coney dog that I have ever had outside of Detroit because they make sure to keep everything traditional from the bun, hot dog, and chili.  In addition to the traditional Coney dog they also sell Detroit classics like Faygo and Vernors soft drinks so you can have an all Detroit meal.  They also offer different meals like burgers for those that do not like chili dogs but I would recommend trying out the Coney dogs you won't be disappointed. The service at Detroit Coney Grill is very fast because their kitchen is setup assembly line style like a sandwich restaurant so they can pump out chili dogs quick.  You will never have to wait long after you pull up to start eating because you go up to the register and order your food then go down to the end of the kitchen line and wait around 2 minutes for your food to be called out.  The employees are extremely kind and a couple of them that I have talked to are actually from Detroit which is nice that they can add into the culture of the restaurant with their past experiences.  I 100% recommend this place if you are a fan of chili dogs and even if you don't like them I am sure this place might be able to change your mind.",

    "text": "Yes, this is as good as it gets.  Let me explain... Detroit Coney Grill is no more than a little hot dog and hamburger place in a strip shopping center - at least that's how it looks.  It is a basic, simple place that serves a basic menu of various hot dogs and hamburgers.  But as a little of a foodie, let me explain where the \"basic\" gets lost behind the quality of what they serve.  This little place is gradually getting some well deserved national recognition for the quality of their hot dogs and hamburgers.  Let's begin with the hot dogs.  For an affordable price, they serve their own recipe, custom-made hot dogs which, according to the owner, have a little middle eastern spicing in them, which gives them what he called \"that little snap.\"  They have a Detroit Coney Combo Dog which is that hot dog served in a fresh steamed bun, and topped with crumbled beef (their recipe), and chili (again, their recipe).  It is just good.  Better than Nathans, Hebrew National, Vienna Brand, etc.  Perhaps there are better local hot dogs that I don't know about, but these are definitely some of the best I've had in many years.  Remember, this place doesn't have exotic items.  They do a very good job of serving great hot dogs and hamburgers.  I am also a french fry snob.  I am always on the hunt for proper french fries with that proper texture that can only be gotten be soaking them, parboiling them, etc.  I am not an expert on how to do it right.  I just know that when they are done right, they taste right, and with the right texture.  They definitely have it all.  I also hate french fries that are either batter dipped or covered with other strange spices - I am a purist.  I like really good, pure, french fries.  And Detroit Coney Grill has them.  I live in the Austin, Texas area, and only come to Phoenix area once or twice a year on business.  And every trip, a visit to Detroit Coney Grill is mandatory - because of their food.  This trip, I learned that they are supposed to have some great hamburgers as well.  So today, I finally tried one.  I got a double cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Nothing special (not gimmicky).  But the burger meat (which they fresh grind on premises) was \"melt-in-your-mouth.\"  Really, really good.  Very simple, but perfectly done.  In conversations with the owner, I've learned that an important focus for him is doing every little detail correctly, every time, by everyone who works there.  This, I believe will be a formula for long term success.   The place is not impressive looking - the atmosphere is just pleasantly simple.  The prices are quite reasonable.  The service is consistently very friendly and good.  And I have already said that the food is just consistently good.  I hope if the owner reads this review, he remembers that there are fans in Austin waiting for a Detroit Coney Grill to open in central Texas.  Looking forward to seeing one (maybe more) of these coming to Austin area in the near future.",

My husband is from Highland Park and he couldn't stop raving about this place and how much it reminded him of home. Although this place is newly opened they already have a devout following compliments of all the Midwest implants that miss Coney Dogs. I love that the kitchen is open and you can see the employees prepare the meals freshly in front of you. They also offer freshly cut fries, burger, gyros, and salads. On good days you can even get a Faygo Pop and Better Made Chips create  an authentic Detroit experience. The restaurant itself is a little small and warm but you'll enjoy all the Detroit decor and the friendly staff. This place will absolutely be a part of my lunch time rotation!",

    "text": "I've been here at least 10 times now.  I try to bring someone new every time.  CONSISTENTLY, this food is excellent.  What blows my mind more than anything else about Detroit Coney is the staff.  From the big chief to the crew that cooks the food.  Everyone is wonderful and treats you like family.  I've never felt that an employee feels like an \"employee\" I think they feel like they are part of something bigger.  As a business owner myself, I try to make my employees feel the same way.  They are bigger than just one of my employees, they are part of this business.......    The man in charge treats everyone like he's known them for years.  Whether he genuinely remembers me and my family when we walk in those doors, he sure makes us feel like we're a long distant family member that he hasn't seen in years.  It feels good to walk into an establishment and get that kind of attention.  He's upfront, honest and OPEN to any and all suggestions.  He wants nothing more than the spirit of Michigan to creep into this desert town.  As for naysayers who may bitch that this establishment isn't the real deal, that it doesn't serve breakfast, that the prices are higher here than in Michigan.... use some common sense!  It's a small place.  All roads that lead to Phoenix have signs that say \"steep grades\"  To a truck driver, that means higher price of delivery.  To a business owner, that means, cost of goods go up.  Ever wonder why huge bands NEVER play Arizona?  This restaurant is practically importing 50% of it's menu to give his customers the food they are unable to get ANYWHERE else in this state.  It's going to cost more.  As a business owner, I wrap my brain around their price on goods and salary vs profit.    Detroit Coney Grill I would imagine is just a stepping stone to a bigger picture.  Something tells me one day Arizona will get the full blown Coney it deserves and it's all thanks to Detroit Coney Grill.  If I was a millionaire, I'd beg DCG to let me invest.",

Then I added cheese to the dog, which I thought it came normally with for $0.50. I got the food and asked for hot sauce which was another $0.50. I mean come on guys, now you are starting to sound like my cable company. The hot dogs are made with Vienna Beef which is the kind of beef I try to avoid. The chili was not bad and the french fries were good. The best thing about this place was the customer service was good and when I paid with my card they didn't ask for a tip.",

I showed him my check in on yelp and he gave us 10% off our order. I truly appreciate that he went over the menu with us, explained the history of the Detroit Coney Grill, described what meat cuts they use and type of dogs they order. He also sold me on the Faygo Rock & Rye soda. Let me just tell you.... YUM. It's a soda made with pure cane sugar (my favorite). David even let me try it before I purchased it just to make sure I liked it.   The food was really tasty as well. I had a Coney Dog and it was delicious. The guys that served and delivered the food to our table were also helpful and made sure we liked everything. It is not every day that you see an owner and his staff take such pride in their work. I am typically so disappointed in the customer service in most retail and restaurants anywhere I go, but it is such a breath of fresh air to see that David is doing his best to remedy that in his establishment.   If only there was a Coney Grill out in Chandler/Gilbert. :) Soon hopefully!",

The Coneys are the real deal.  They have Faygo pop, Better Made chips and the fries are fantastic.  The salads are fresh and a massive proportion.  The map on the wall of the greater Detroit area is fun.  They provide push-pins so you can mark your home town.  From the friendly greeting at the door to checking up on you during the meal, the owner obviously loves what he is cooking and makes sure each and every guest is happy.   I cannot recommend this place enough.   Especially for fellow Michiganders.",

He has been there every time I've been there so that alone should tell you something, he greets all of his customers as he would his family with respect. And that goes a long way in my books. Now let's move on to the food... I have had almost everything on the menu and let me tell you it all is prepared exactly how it is supposed to be AMAZINGGG. My favorite is the Big D with a coney, You really get the best of both worlds with that sandwich. With my culinary background as being a chef let me tell you, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER MYSELF AND THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH!!!! I wanna finish off by saying thanks to all the staff at Detroit Coney for giving me and my family a wonderful experience every time",

A robust smile as he is satisfied by my reaction. - I am in the car, I open my dog. The aroma is right on. Reminds me of home, Kirby's, Pete's, National, and every Greek restaurant coney in between. - I notice the softeness of the steamed bun. - I bring it to my lips and the taste of fresh diced onions, sweet chili, and the snap of the dog.

The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want \"like subway\" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger, served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done, what a superstar employee.

It is easy to see why they made the list: cheap prices, quick service, and good food -- win-wins in any Yelper's book!   The smells coming of the grill are downright intoxicating. Even the kraut gets a turn on the hot top before making its way onto your Plain Coney Dog.   Sodium watching friends beware, though, this is not the place for you! The skin on hand-cut fries are sinfully bathed in salt. But they are tasty and I ate them all up! A $6 meal well-worth it!",

We could see our order being made right in front of our eyes.  Wow, were our taste buds in for a surprise. We all ordered burgers, doubles, a triple, and a quad. The burgers were so juicy, with some amazing mixture of condiments added, and those grilled onions; yumm! The fries are real, and their house made ranch to dip them in is to die for. Their onion rings were a mix of light breading with a hint of sweet. Just Amazing! Thanks for a great dinner. You've got to bring one of these to California .",

After trying to find another coney joint that is hidden on asu campus that we found out is a True secret jem amongst REAL coney lovers only to find out they are closed for summer, my friend talked me into going here instead.. The dogs were burnt and not even hot, chili was like mud. Consistency and flavor wise which was NONE. The fries were these thick cut things with dirt tasting potato skins still on them and nasty oily fake \"cheese\" that also had zero taste. Even my friend said something was way off and had been there months ago. He thought they were substituting with generic canned chilli like Hormel's. Another tip, when people come into your business you greet them and make them feel welcomed, you do the same as they leave, and ask \"How was everything\"? They probably knew better than to ask that though. We will NOT be back...",

Today I had some time to grab a bite and on an impulse, DCG was my choice...  I was super excited because I knew it had 4-5 star reviews but I was thinking \"All these reviews are from people who are from Detroit\" so of course I had to check it out and see for myself   When I first walked in, I think the guy at the register knew it was my first time, he was extremely nice and gave me the run down of the menu and the history of his shop... He wish the owner, Dave. He told me all about the process of cooking and the ingredients that go into each menu item. Of course I had wanted a coney, because that's what was in the name (DCG) but Dave woo'd me into getting a burger because it was their daily special... I liked him immediately because he was saving me money! He said I could try the coney on my next visit, tomorrow, Wednesday... Because they have a special on coneys! I really like how he was very nice and he didn't try to rush me or let me try something I might not like... Honestly everything on the menu sounded good so I'm pretty sure I will go through all of it eventually...   I opted for the Faygo pop just because I felt that it would make my dining experience a little more special... I got the orange one... I have to say Faygo is really sweet... I see that it is made of a pure cane sugar and I could taste it... I enjoyed it though...  My burger was delivered to me at my table by the guy who made it!  The burger was cooked brilliantly... The seasoning in the burger is what made me like it... I dressed mine up with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, mayo, and pickles...   As I was eating, Dave and his wife were sitting at the table next to me chatting and nibbling on something as well... It was very kind and thoughtful of him to look over and check on me... He asked how I was enjoying my food. As a small business owner, it is things like that which keep customers happy and make them feel welcomed in your establishment. I felt very comfortable eating that quad burger and I think he was a little surprised my little frame finished everything...  All in all, my visit to DCG went really well and I can say that I will be returning again and again...   So for all of you non-Detroitains (probably not correct) check this place out, meet the owner, and have a yummy lunch/dinner...",

I am especially fond of the \"loose\" which is a bun, onion and chili.  I honestly did not expect to find it here and was pleasantly surprised.

Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I felt like goofing off and driving around aimlessly and I decided to go on a hot dog tour.    We started here and decided to adopt the attitude of \"when in Rome\" and ordered what appeared to be the house specialty, The Detroit Coney Combo with the hot dog and onions and mustard and chili and the loose ground beef all in one big pile of goodness.    First, the dude working the register has more patience than I ever would because first timers have no idea how to order here and it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning.  We got to listen to him explain things a couple of times to the group in front of us, so when he got to me, I was ready.    We shared the Detroit Coney combo and the fresh cut spiral cut fries, which come in a huge serving by the way, and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle them with crack because those are totally addictive!  Fried perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous that the onions and chili on the combo would come back and haunt me later, but they did not.  Everyone played nice in my belly and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.  Combo, fries, and fountain drink was $9.18 with tax.  I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "In the state of Michigan there exists a particular type of hot dog known as a coney. Why is it called a coney? No one knows. As far as I know it's not named after Coney Island in New York. It's not named after the SNL sketch turned 90s movie the Coneheads either, and it's not named after Joseph Kony the leader of the Ugandan resistance movement.   What is a Coney hot dog you might be asking? Well it's a hot dog with a chilli, mustard and onion. This differs a bit from a regular chilli dog due to the mustard to balance out the chilli flavor.   And this brings me to Detroit Coney Grill, while in the metropolitan Phoenix area I checked around with local yelpers to help me track down hot dog places to review and this was one of those recommendations. So one afternoon I set my sights on visiting Detroit Coney Grill and giving it a try.  The restaurant itself has a fair bit of seating available with one long counter encompassing both where you order and where your food is prepared. I went for a coney dog and water and within a few minutes my food was ready and it was time to dig in. The hot dog had a lot of very nice tasting meaty chilli on it, the combination of the chilli mixed with the mustard was nice and the sausage itself tasted good. This was a skinless sausage on a regular seedless bun. There were a lot of diced onions on top that added to the mix. Overall this was an excellent combination of ingredients and a very satisfying hot dog.   If I had to complain about anything it's that it was a tad pricey, it was a little over 4.00 for the hot dog and a cup of water. I will say that this was a far better tasting hot dog with chilli as the primary ingredient than the one I had at Ted's also located in Tempe Arizona, but for the same price roughly I got a footlong there. Overall I'd say my food was excellent but the value was a little lacking. I am going to give Detroit Coney Grill a solid four stars and a recommendation.",

Their boxed water is to die for and their faygo pops are great as well. Detroit feeling in Arizona you can't beat it. They gave us some chips to try as well that were great. We would definitely come back...unless they opened one in CALIFORNIA!!!! Hehe. Thanks guys!!",

And dont be afraid when you see that the burgers start at a double, the patties are on the thinner side so a double comes in just about right.",

Chilli was a real disappointment. I did not finish half of it, just did not like it. 2.95 for a snall bowl and again the flavor was unimpressive. Service was good and friendly.   I would drive 5 miles further to go to Teds Hot Dogs in Tempe,  but some people here obviously are repeat customers.   Overall I would rate the fries and service good. The chilli  poor and Coney dogs as so so at best.",

I saw DCG on  Facebook Friday night and decided we would head over there for lunch the next day. I've tried coneys before from a restaurant that sold itself on food from back home. We tried it and weren't impressed. So, I was skeptical. I ordered 2 Detroit coney dogs, a Rock n Rye Faygo and coney fries. I also knew  (from  Facebook) there may be Superman ice cream in the near future...if it wasn't already all sold out. The coney dogs tasted a little bolder than I remember. But, I also tasted memories. So,  these coney dogs passed the taste test and ripped my skepticism into teensy shreds of nothingness. The Faygo pop was awesome as always. To wrap up my time in coney heaven, I ordered Superman ice cream and a Faygo pop to go. The ice cream is exactly as I remembered. My better half had never had this ice cream so we shared the ice cream. He loves it.  Btw, customer service is top-top-top notch. This place is worth the 30-minute drive each way. Perhaps some day it will come to the West Valley. If/when it does, I'm a be a regular. I  DCG.",

My son really wanted to go because they are the only place that serves Faygo that we have found in the area.  We all walked in to a very packed whole in the wall.  The place has a great atmosphere and the gal at the register greeted us immediately.  She was very patient as three teenagers and two adults ordered half the menu.  We had a great time, the food was delicious, and everyone was completely satisfied when we left.  The boys even got to take home extra empty Faygo bottles.  Don't ask me why, I didn't bother asking them why....lol",

I was expecting Cajun seasoning with a little more flavor and bite. Not happening. Nothin special. The hot dog was good. Nice snap when you bit into it. Trust me on the onion thing tho. Oh yeah. I'm from Cincinnati and nothing beats Skyline Chili so take my review with a grain of salt.",

Only place I could get them was back in Michigan or to bring the ingredients back here to Arizona when I travel up there. These are real Detroit Coney dogs it was just like being back home. The food was excellent the service was great and the people are very nice. I had the Coney dog, Chili Cheese Fries and Faygo Rock & Rye it was so good! I'm so glad they are in town and I'm hoping they will open one in the East Valley. I live in Apache Junction and would love to have one closer to home but will definitely drive to Tempe if I have to. It's worth the drive!",

Now it's not as necessary since we finally have one here!!! And let me tell you, it's the real deal. We met the owner our first visit; he's an awesome guy from Michigan with a real love for what he does. He imports the coney dogs straight from Detroit, along with Faygo & Better Made chips!  I got the Hani, which I usually get in Michigan, and it tasted exactly the same!!!! I can't tell you how happy I was! I've been to restaurants who try to mock the Hani or imitate it slightly... It's always a let down. But the Hani at Detroit Coney Grill: LEGIT!! I overheard the guy at the table next to me (also a fellow Michigander) say how awesome the coney dogs are too. How could they not be, though? They're straight from the D!!! I plan on trying everything on the menu and I plan on being extremely satisfied with it all as well. ;) The atmosphere is fun & filled with Detroit pride. It's also very clean! There were tons of Michigan people there too, which is always fun to talk to fellow Michiganders with that Midwest, humble mentality. The service was great - everyone who works there is super nice!! Quick too! The owner was chatting with us for a while when we were there which was really nice. You can tell he just wants to see his customers happy. It's nice to finally have a little piece of Michigan here in Arizona! I can't wait to come back!!! I'm bringing all my friends too, to show them Michigan knows what's up when it comes to good food! :)",

    "text": "Well, it finally happened. The Burger Guy found a burger in Arizona so inspiring it's motivated me to come out of hiding. In case you're wondering, which you're probably not, because you live in AZ and likely have no idea who I am, but if you were wondering... I moved to Phoenix, AZ five years ago and retired the LA Burger Tour. I may resume it one day, as I still hear about new awesome burger places in LA I haven't tried. Anyway, on to the review!  The Burger - 9 (out of 10) As previously mentioned, the Burger Guy has lived in the Phoenix area (the Valley of the Sun as it's locally known) for five years, and you can bet hundreds of Phoenix burgers were consumed in that time. Well folks, I can confidently and definitively say this is the best burger in the Valley, (Ok ok well it's my favorite at least). Often the best burgers need the fewest words, so I'll keep the description short. These are almost certainly the thinnest burger patties I've ever come across, and I'm sure that is part of the magic. The bun, meat, and cheese all come together in perfect harmony, and I would say the key word with this burger is cohesive. The flavors just blend together wonderfully. Get it anyway you like, but I strongly recommend the triple. It's the perfect meat to bun ratio. The Burger Guy likes his with both kinds of cheese, bacon, grilled onions, lettuce, pickle, and the holy trifecta of sauces (one of the few burgers I like ketchup on). This may be my favorite basic burger in the world!  If you get a chance to meet the owner, David, you will see the passion that is behind this truly special burger. The whole staff is awesome and will make you feel like a welcome friend.  Phoenix Burger Tour (Burger rating is out of 10. Ratings are for flavor of the burger ONLY, and other factors like ambience, service, and price are not considered).  -Detroit Coney Grill 9  The burger at DCG is so good it's inspired me to do a Phoenix Burger Tour. I'll post my next reviews in the coming weeks. Until then, here is one last posting of the LA Burger Tour list:  The LA Burger Tour  -Yuca's 8 -The Counter 7.25 -Chano's 6.5 -The Oinkster 8.25 -Father's Office 9.25 -The Foundry 9 Henry's Hat 6.75 -Slow Club (San Francisco) 9.75 -Capitol Burger 7 -Cassell's 7 -8oz 8 -25 Degree 6.5 -The Golden State 9 -Apple Pan 8.25 -CommeCa 8.5 -Fix 8 -26 Beach 7.25 -JNJ Burger Shack 8 -Master Burger 7.75 -The Bowery 9 -Fatburger 7.75 -Umami Burger 8.75 -Juicy Burger 8.5 -Oaks Gourmet 8.75* (*Maggie did not vote) -Hawkins 7.25 -Irv's Burgers 7.5 -Rustic Canyon 9.5 (Maggie not voting below) -5 Guys 8 -The Habit 8.25 -In N Out 8.25",

    "text": "The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls.  I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice!  Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers, Pitas, Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well.  The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side.  Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP!  3.5 STARS",

You also know, that there is NOWEHRE in the valley, that makes a cheesesteak that tastes remotely close to Penn Station...  UNTILL I tried Detroit Coney Grill.  While they don't make the sub version, their cheesesteak pita is a fine substitute...and the cheesesteak tastes JUST like Penn Station.  My ex-wife has been in the valley over 4 years, and was unable to find a cheesesteak like Penn Station.  Im glad I found Detroit Coney Grill!!  Now, as far as everything else goes..YUMMY!!  I have been trying to find someplace around that makes a chili similar to Tommys...and this is it.  The burger patties ARE small, but that's ok.  Get a triple, with chili..and you are SET!  The dogs DO have that familiar snap when you bite them.  I love the cheese sauce the use for the chili cheese fries...and the psudeo-Maid Rite loose meat they use for some of the menu items is delish as well!!  Imagine a tray of fries, covered in loose meat, then smothered in chili, then topped with cheese sauce.  GOOG GAWD MAN!  The owner and employees are super nice.   I had ordered a chicken philly pita with no mushrooms..but after the rest of my family had ordered, the owner, who was taking our order, had forgotten to subtract the mushrooms.  So when he saw me picking the mushrooms out, he apologized. Later, as we were finishing up, he came out from back with a bowl, that had 4 scoops of their Superman Ice cream...free of charge!  It kinda sucks, that now I have found this amazing place, I have to move up off of Happy Valley Rd.  Its ok. it wont stop me from coming back.  Thanks!",

As far as the coney dog itself I really liked the chili that they put on the dog and of course the dog itself is quite tasty. Other than that I thought it was nothing too special that I couldn't get anywhere else. The fries did consist of huge portions but other than that they were fairly bland tasting.  It could just be me but I really don't understand all the great reviews and hype surrounding this place. Perhaps it's because I haven't had this kind of hot dog before but I feel that there are plenty of other options within the area for food. Having tried Ted's Hot Dogs before coming here I would rather go there instead and they also have better fries there.  I honestly do feel bad going against the many positive reviews on here but there was nothing much here than made me want to come back again.",

Great food at a great price and with awesome service, the folks in there are friendly and take pride in the delicious food they serve.  My only regret is there isn't one in South Chandler, but this one is still worth the drive when I'm craving a coney and a messy yet tasty burger.

The Beyond Burger not only tastes and \"feels\" (texture wise) like a 'real' burger, but also LOOKS like a real burger, too! (Seriously; the inside of the burger was kind of pink!)  I've had other veggie burgers before but you can generally tell that those are plant-based. If I hadn't known already before trying it that this was plant-based, I never would have known. These are incredible, and I would highly recommend any vegetarians or honestly anyone who wants to try these to go and check them out at Detroit Coney Grill! 5 stars, hands down.",

    "text": "In terms of fast food, I really enjoyed the service and food options. However, because of the cost and yelp reviews, I had some pretty high expectations for the portions (yes, that is very American of me to complain about). I split a coney combo (2 chili dogs and fries) with my husband about $10 total). While that's a pretty great deal compared to other places, I am spoiled by the $1.50 hot dog combo at Costco. Accordingly, I expected a hot dog that was Costco-food court size and I expected more chili. The hot dog itself was fine, but again, compared to Costco, I found it to be higher on the processed-food taste than I expected. That said, it was PACKED with happy customers and I still plan to try out their chili cheese fries soon. So, even though I didn't rate a 4 or 5, I would still recommend experiencing this place!",

Even better they do not short you on the chili.  They provide enough to where it overflows just a little bit with each bite.  Additionally, they also give an ample amount of chili on the chili fries so that you don't have all the ones on the bottom without chili.    My only complaint, if you can even call it that, were the fries themselve were not exactly like you'd get at a coney in Detroit.  This is not to say they are not good...because they are very tasty...they are just different.",

Obviously this establishment is known for their  coneys, but let me tell you, them burgers will go toe to toe with some of the most proclaimed burger spots in the valley. Highly recommend the newer menu choices, such as the \"Big Mack-inaw\" which is their spin on the big mac, equipped with 4 thin beef patties, 3 pieces of bread, and some of that *secret sauuce*. \"The Big D\" is another local legend which is pretty much a blend between a quad (maybe a triple i forgot) burger loaded with chili. Lets just say you'll need a fork and knife for that one. Apart from the great food, the owner always is there to enthusiastically greet you, ask you how your day is. Nothing is better than an establishment where ownership genuinely cares about their customers. Keep on doing your thing Coney Grill.",

There was a tiny part of me hoping they would surprise me with an olive burger but I don't think I saw one on the menu. At any rate, we split the basket since we needed a quickie before a movie down the street. My hubs who has never been to Mi, needed to be introduced to what a Coney was. Be was very impressed! I love this place and I find it comforting too see this little tiny piece of Mi in the desert. I will definitely be back! I discovered Detroit's in the Entertainment Guide. Most of my favorite places were discovered via the Entertainment Guide. I am somewhat new to AZ and there are so many choices. It basically serves as a compass for us. That and Yelp of course. I will be back! #yum Now if we could get our own little Frankenmuth. Awe, good times in Mi. P.S. the Blue Moon made my day to say the least. I snuck the rest into the movie and savored it in the dark. And now I see on FB that they are serving Superman ice cream tomorrow. #memorylane",

    "text": "I've been here twice, and both times, I just don't get what the fuss is about.  Maybe it's just a matter of preference when it comes to certain things about hot dogs, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the Coney dog served here.  To be fair, I've never had one before anywhere else, so I can't compare to other establishments.  The cashier was very friendly and she even read my name off my work badge somehow and called me by name the rest of the time I was there.  I think that's a really nice touch.  The owner too, he's such a super cool guy and I really want to like the food because of it.  I got a Coney dog with french fries that I added the option of putting Frank's Red Hot all over them.  I saw the new menu item, the big-mackinaw and had to try it also.  The dog - the onions had a really off putting smell to them.  I don't know if they were old, or if it was the way that they interacted with the chili, but every time I brought the dog to my mouth, I was grossed out by the terrible smell of the onions.  It almost had that B.O. smell of old onions.  The snap of the dog, I love a snap, but this was REALLY snappy, kind of felt strange to me.  This chili is OK, I would add more mustard personally  The burger - huge!  Cooked to perfection, melty cheese, and then....the onions!  Nooooooo! There were so many onions on this burger, it completely destroyed my palate.  All I could taste was onion.  While I was in line, I was listening to each person's order, and it seemed like they were all ordering with no onions.  I remember thinking, if you come to a place, order it the way they make it, they know what they're doing.  By the end of my meal, I realized why.  Maybe it's not why THEY ordered with no onions, but I certainly would order with no onion next time.  The weird smelly onions on the dog, and the way too abundant amount of onions on my burger were enough to wonder what the hype is.  If you love onions, come here.  If you don't, order without onions.  The burger and the personality of the owner and cashier were enough for me to some day want to go back and order with no onions.",

If you do go with the burger, don't shy away from both cheeses, bacon, jalapeno, grilled onion, and feta... it's the only way to go.",

Order it any way you like and you'll get it to your table quick and with a smile.  Want more food?  You can get more patties--order 18 if you like and eat 'em if you can.

First the pros: Food was fresh, easily could order without bun, had great topping options. Flavors were great! Avocado and bacon were decent.  Cons: burgers are only 2 oz - ordered 8 patties and probably the equivalent of 2 regular size patties. Toppings were sparse, i got one  lettuce leaf, one small slice of tomato, I asked for extra pickles and received 4 small chips. I paid $14 which I find to be heavily overpriced for the actual amount of food I got. If the patties were a lot thicker, then I would understand.  I can get 8 patties with the fixings at in n out for under $10.  This was a great place to experience but too pricey. I think if I ate fries and bun, it would be worth it. It gets tricky and overpriced with dietary restrictions.",

And aren't there already too many fake so-called restaurant reviews around already?  So let's avoid the hype.  This place isn't fancy, it's in a strip mall, the people who work here are just regular folks and the food is good but let's be real, it's not the best on Planet Earth.  It's not Michelin 5-star fantabulous, just normal, but I like it and I would come back again.   I ordered the closest thing on their menu to a basic cheeseburger and fries.  The price was just what I would consider fair, not quite as cheap as McD's but nowhere near the outrageous prices all these new pretentious chain fast food places are charging.  My double cheeseburger (the smallest they sell) with a regular fountain drink (the only size they sell) and a regular fries (ditto the only size available) ended up just over $8 bucks with tax.  That's a buck or two more than the equivalent meal at the franchise burger chains, about the same price as In 'n Out and about half what 5 Guys, Smashburger or similar overhyped places charge.  The sandwich guy made it the way I requested (lettuce, onion, pickle, mayo, mustard).  They didn't try to drown crappy meat in an over abundance of weird toppings so the net result was that I could actually taste the beef.  It was simple but good.  The fries, which they fresh cut all day, were simple and good.  The fountain drink was reasonable priced and the available options were simple and normal.  The decor is simple, the seating is simple, the place is kept clean, it's not filled with 1000 screaming kids bouncing in an ocean of fluorescent blue plastic balls. They don't try to shame you into automatically adding a tip with their credit card reader.  No one has fake smiles but then again no one looks grouchy either.  I'm glad my experience was simple because wading through the owner's website isn't. It's obvious his goal is to franchise and expand.  Phoenix is a hotbed for such startups, and some have been pretty successful at it.  I'm glad I caught them when I could still consider them a non-chain. I wish him well but honestly I'm not exactly sure what his magic ingredient is going to be that differentiates him from all the rest.  This restaurant seems too simple to be very memorable.",

They always have faygo sodas which is a staple soda from Detroit. The menu is pretty diverse where you can get the staple Coney dogs, chili fries, and the delicious burger, but you even have some Mediterranean gyros and salads. Something for everyone!  I've been here a few times, I've tried out the burgers which I think is one of the best seasoned burgers out there. Thin patties and they grind their own burgers on site. Super good! With this trip I wanted to try the veggie pita with avocado. Something a little lighter but it's still very filling. Its pretty saucey of a pita but had all the right veggies in the pita. Pretty good! They also just started offering beer battered cheese sticks and they were talking them up. Gave them a shot and they tasted like an extra crispy battered cheese stick which I really liked. Always need some ranch on the side to dip them in. Give them a shot!  All around good place and really friendly owners. On the heavier side of food but you should know that when you go to a place like this.",

Based on the presence of a gyro on the menu and the generous servings, I'm guessing there's a Greek in the kitchen... but I failed to ask, perhaps you will remember to inquire when you visit.  I chose the Wednesday special- 2 coneys, handcut fries and a fountain drink for $9.99. I went with chili, onions, mustard and cheese on both - and on the cashiers suggestion ordered one with shredded cheese and one with \"squeeze cheese,\" also known as nacho or melted cheese. She shared with me that the squeeze cheese variant is what is considered the norm in Michigan, making this an educational as well as tasty dining experience.  The fries? Some of the best I've ever had. Cut and fried with incredible consistency. I used no ketchup, as I didn't want to ruin the flavor. The coneys were full length hot dogs and delicious. Fountain drinks included strawberry pop - so pretty much this is the perfect lunch spot. I think you should visit!",

Plus they have flamin hot onion rings which my sister ordered when we went & they were to die for!!! So delicious! They have a daily special which is a different combo everyday for on or around $8 & some change. Very budget friendly!!  The owner is extremely friendly. He personally greeted everyone who walked into his restaurant & he had a big smile & his attitude was extremely positive that he made the atmosphere so nice! I would come back just for his friendly demeanor.  The service was very quick & they even offered a discount through yelp!! I recommend this place if you want a taste of a good hot dog or burger or if you want to step out of your zone and be daring with the flamin hot onion rings!! :)) You'll enjoy yourself here.",

I kept is simple and had the basic condiments (NO onions!)  The bun makes the burger, and they don't disappoint. Soft, but it held together; perfect. The meat was cooked perfectly, and the double is plenty of meat. If you're a T. Rex you can order multiple patties.  Last time I was there I had the beer battered onion rings, and they were VERY good and cooked just right. This time I tried tater tots w/blue cheese and Frank's RedHot. The blue cheese added a nice bite to the plate, but the tots could have been cooked more. They didn't hold together when \"forked.\" If you order tots there ask that they cook them to firmness :-)  Friendly service, and fast; considering they custom make your order. Plenty of Michigan memorabilia; the guy says they order a lot of authentic foods from Michigan/midwest to keep it real. Bettermade Chips, Faygo pop, Superman Ice Cream . . .  Next time, I'll have a Coney Dog to keep my life as exciting as I can push it! :-)",

I found my home here in Az and I will be coming here ALL THE TIME . I give 10 stars to this place ! Thank you ! And I live in Verrado 45 mins west of Tempe ! The owner is super friendly !",

After multiple visits it's clear that Detroit Coney Grill is legit. Everything I've ordered has been top notch. The coney dogs, the loose burgers and the classic burgers and, of course, the fresh cut fries (go Cajun style!). They do it all and they do it greatly. You will not find a better coney dog in the valley. It does not matter where you are from, the food is fantastic. Detroit Coney Grill has become one of my favorite dining spots in the valley. This is also the only place I know of where I can order food and wipe my feet on an Ohio State rug (the homer in me loves this).",

The fries were pretty good and the Faygo soda was a nice touch too.  The place was a little dirty but probably because they had just gone through a rush.  They were out of Ketchup but gave us some packets from behind the counter.  The cashier didn't know the product which is fine but since we'd never been here and aren't from Michigan we need some help.  The cook which I think is the owner stepped up and guided us.  I hope to go back and have them earn that extra sliver of a star.  Kids both had burgers which looked good and they said they were good but I'd go Coney all day.",

    "text": "When I hear the words \"Detroit\" and \"Coney\" in the same sentence, I generally have a good idea of what to expect. Detroit Coney Grill comes close...   As a Detroit Native transplanted to Arizona's East Valley, I was glad to find at least SOME of my hometown favorites, which is why this place gets 4 stars. No wing dings, no breakfast any time...which make me sad,  but plenty of D town chilli goodness. I've been there twice and have left full and satisfied.  My first visit was actually very pleasant.. David had one of the cooks fix me up a 'Telway' styled slider on the house.. everything is made fresh to order (hence no wingdings.. they're frozen and take too long) and the cooks are more than eager to give you the food the way you like... I asked for the potatoes to be slightly soft and I got them just the way I like them. Other than the distance, I'm in San Tan Valley, they're in Tempe.. a good 45 minutes away, I would be there once a week.   A few warnings:   *If you order chili cheese fries, opt for sliced cheese rather than cheese sauce... it's how they do it at my favorite coney island in Detroit, and you'll be glad you went that route.   *Seasoned fries are a little over seasoned.. if you want to try those, ask for light seasoning or really just opt for plain fries.. they're made fresh.. why ruin them with a heavy coating of lawry's?   *the spiral fries don't add much to the meal other than a premium price tag, so opt instead for the plain ones and fork out that extra dough on the chili instead.   *finally, know how to order a coney... it's a steamed bun, a snappy dearborn dog, chili, mustard and diced onions. Deviate from this at your own peril, and be warned... they will make fun of you if you do!",

She lives in north Scottsdale close to Pinnacle peak and when I'm visiting the Valley of the Sun we always make the trek down to Tempe to go here for lunch.  I've tried many of the offerings and will admit I do like the food here. Also, the service is friendly and fairly efficient.  However, for the price, and good business they do, for gods sake, hire someone to wipe the effing tables off!  My goodness, the owner should be embarrassed.  Every time I come here the tables are never clean!  It's gross!  CLEAN IT UP!!!",

It tasted just like I had ordered from duly's on w Vernor and junction. A True taste of Detroit indeed. Definitely going back for more. It's a must for True Detroiters wanting that True Detroit taste. The best part was meeting the owner and finding your he knew my neighborhood in southwest Detroit.

The owner is an awesome guy, he came out and talked with all the customers, and everything inside is Michigan related. I tried Rockin Rye Faygo for the first time and i'm hooked.

    "text": "First of all, I have always loved Yelp because it never lets me down! So when Yelp says it's good it usually is pretty accurate.  So I came here because of the \"Yelp Top 100 restaurants\" lIst. This place was voted #30 in the nation! Let's just think about this for a second. This is the 30th best place in the nation to eat!? Wow, I gotta go. After looking at the pictures on Yelp I was a bit sceptical I must say, but Yelp has yet to disappoint!  I just went to the #10 place on that list \"Little Miss Bbq\" and had to wait an hour to get in, but it was worth every minute! Amazing! Best food I've ever shoved down my face!  So around noon, an excited and optimistic me walks in to a relatively small place with lots of Detroit memorabilia on the walls and a very friendly girl working the counter. (Her and the staff are the only reason it gets even 3 stars) One person in front of me in line.  (Not a good sign) She said the Coney dog and hamburgers are what they are know for, so that's what I got. I also threw in some chilli cheese fries.  Dogs and burgers are cooked on a flattop and cheese out of a can. Kinda disappointing for the 30th BEST restaurant in the nation, but Yelp has to be right, right? Anyways, food came out fast and correct. Sadly, it was what I thought it would be. Just normal chilli dog and the burger was good but extremely average. My friend made the comment about the chilli, \"reminds me of Sonic chilli\". He was spot on and that's not a good thing. Remember I'm coming to the \"30th BEST PLACE TO EAT IN THE NATION\"!  This isn't the 30th BEST PLACE TO EAT on Broadway, let alone nation! Average might be a stretch, but the service and friendly staff gets it there. If you want a normal strip mall sorta lunch, are from Detroit, have lost all your taste buds in a horrible fire breathing accident from those crazy circus days, you happen to break down on front of this place, only have a few minutes to eat before the tow truck gets there and are really into extremely average food. THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!  I've lost all faith in humanity and Yelp if this is the \"30th BEST RESTAURANT IN THE NATION\"! I'm now questioning everything I've ever been told in life.",

In short, I don't think I can go to Five Guy$ or In-n-Out again after getting used the burgers at this place.  The fries are great as well and always cut in-house.

We sampled the food at this Tempe location of Detroit Coney Grill and hired them on the spot for a party we were giving. Not only is the food oozing Detroit, but, the hospitality that David exudes makes you feel as if you grew up with him in Detroit. Our party, catered by DCG even made the vegetarians grab a dog. The greek salad was outstanding as well. Detroit chips, Faygo pop, and you'll think you're back in Michigan. Don't miss this great hometown treat....Detroit or not, everyone loves a good dog!",

The Big D burger could have gotten really sloppy really quick but surprisedly didn't at all. Overallawesome place, will definitely be back!",

I ate two up with extra mustard almost every Friday night before I went to work at my other job. I went to school with the family that made the most delicious Viennas (and Red Hots, Ring Bologna, etc.) which are tradition at all of the area Coneys.  I even make a trip to one of the area favorites almost annually..  So for me I thinks it's fair to call this authentic, but it's still not the real thing. A pretty good local coney -sure. Now if only they had French Fries with gravy.  That's another Coney tradition.  Or better yet, fried mushrooms with cocktail sauce on the side. And what was most obvious was the cost.  I took out a few family members for lunch and spent much less than $40 for four people.   Six coneys, soup, salad, fries with gravy, four beverages.  Here it's gonna cost ya more. If you got a hankering for a Coney, this will probably work. For me, I'll just continue to load my luggage with Koegels or wait to eat one up when I travel back to MI.",

What's more, they do it with so much passion, that they shine in a crowded sea of foodie options.   Adding DCG to my Yelp! list after seeing it highlighted for its top reviews, I noticed I was nearby after a morning meeting in the area. Decided to drop in for lunch.   Staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door. The owner (I think) was engaging with folks and teaching a new employee as she helped me-- totally friendly and supportive of her as she figured things out, which was cool to see. I wasn't going to order my dogs Coney style, but they prodded/teased me into it. Glad they did. The chili, mustard, and onions isn't normally something I'd go for, but it was a great combo with the hotdog. And their fries are good!  Dogs and burgers aren't haute cuisine. And that's the point. The only things that matter are if its tasty as heck and if you have fun while eating. You'll get that, here.   A cool place to visit and revisit...",

You can buy the t-shirts too I think.  The menu is pretty simple, burgers and dogs. Pita sandwiches and salads, fries, chips and drinks.  They have several flavors of Faygo soda pop for $2.25 and bags of Better Made Potato Chips.  There is no Sanders Hot Fudge or ice cream of any kind.  No desserts that I saw at all.  I ordered the regular Coney Dog, $3.95 which came with Chili and onions, an order of the hand cut French fries to split, and Faygo (\"Which way diddee go!?\") Root Beer.  My daughter got a Breaded Chicken Tenderloin \"Hani\" Pita Sandwich and also a root beer.  The minute I bit into a French fry and tasted how delicious it was, I walked up to the counter, told the guy, \"I'm not sharing those so we'd better get another order!\". They tasted like my Mother's homemade ones!   The Coney Dog looked a little small on first view, but I bit into the hot dog and it almost audibly popped! Scrumptious juices exuded from it.  This is no ordinary hot dog.  Warning: It's messy.    The root beer bottle was kind of tepid, not ice cold, maybe just because they had such a rush of business on Opening Day that they couldn't keep up with the demand? I took my water glass, filled with ice and poured the drink over it, solving the problem.    The owner is very nice.  He and all the employees are all from various parts of Michigan.  I'm from Livonia, suburb of Detroit, myself.  I had heard about this Grand Opening at another Detroit themed place, Sunshine Motor City Cafe, and I think it is great that we ex-Michiganders have more than one place now to go get that back-home feeling, even if it is 113 outside!",

    "text": "4.5 Stars.  Tempe=Hot Dog Paradise!  3 great hot dog joints all within 5 miles of each other.  Decisions, decisions!  How would Detroit Coney Grill stack up?  Pretty damn well as you are about to find out!  I had driven by this place a few times but was always on my way down the street to Ted's.  When I woke up this morning, I was craving a hot dog (Twice in less than a week).  I decided to drive on down and see what Detroit Coney Grill was all about.  I had never had a \"Coney Dog\" before today either.  I was browsing their website and noticed that they had a Wednesday special which was 2 Coney Dogs, Fries and a Fountain Drink for $8.88.  Sounded like a plan.  I drove down, parked and walked in.  Right when I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of the workers.  I also noticed that the owner (one of the owners?) was behind the counter talking with the staff and shootin the shit.  I went up to the register and placed my order for the Wednesday Special.  My total was $9.40.  I paid the lady my money, grabbed my cup for my drink and was on the way over to the Coke machine.  While I was making my way over to get my drink, the owner guy walked up to me, asked me how I was doing and shook my hand.  I thought that was really cool and it shows that he appreciates his customers!  I grabbed my soda from the awesome Freestyle Coke Machine and took a seat.  While I was sitting there, I noticed that the owner was talking shop with every single customer in the joint.  He was explaining how they grind their own beef for their burgers, make their own chili, giving recommendations to customers etc etc.  Really personable dude!  A few minutes later, my number was called and I grabbed my stuff.  Here is how it was................  Coney Dogs-  These dogs come topped with their homemade Coney Sauce aka chili, onions and mustard.  This chili is ladled on top of a natural casing dog and nestled inside of a steamed hot dog bun.  The chili kind of reminded me of a Tommy's type chili (CA folks know what I'm talking about).  It had plenty of spices in it and had a great flavor and texture.  I really enjoyed it!  The mustard and onions worked well too and the bun was super soft.  Great snap to the dogs, too!  These 2 dogs were mighty fine!  Fries-  Fresh cut fries!  They were salted perfect, fried perfect and flat out some of the best hand cut fries I have had in quite some time.  Decent sized portion, too!  After I was done with my meal, I was going back to the Coke machine to get a refill for the road.  I ran into the owner again and he asked me how everything was and gave me a fist bump.  I can't remember a time when I received such great customer service at a place...seriously!   I will be back just because of that!  Great dogs, great fries and amazing hospitality make this a joint I can definitely see myself coming back to eventually.",

Everything is so flavorful and priced fairly. They even have daily specials every day! I cannot get over the Coney dogs, it's a must on your first visit! The environment is awesome; always an upbeat individual at the register and super fast employees on the grill. They open at 10:30 which is just in time for lunch rushes to begin. Especially given the area they are located (lots of business) Also don't make the mistake I did and show up on a Sunday, they are closed on Sundays :(",

It's still weird not to have Coney Island on that list but I'm definitely not complaining! Plus, the owner is SUPER nice!! I hope he opens more around the valley since I'm in central Phx. Plus, ASU downtown (where the cool kids go) would totally eat it up! Rush hour traffic pretty much stops me from going M-F, so that really only leaves Sat:( I could probably eat chili cheese fries everyday. Let's be honest, as a teen I totally did;)  And to the few people on here complaining about the prices, seriously??? We go here with my other friends from Michigan and the 4 of us for $24. Pretty cheap for such deliciousness!",

This was one option that my best friend seemed to really be drawn to, so we drove to pick up some dinner. We both had the coney combo without onion. It was pretty tasty. What I definitely appreciated was the service. We didn't have to wait for our order to be taken, it didn't take long to get it and the staff did ask when we were done how everything was. What further surprised me is just as we were getting up to clean the table, one of the staff members came over and took our baskets to the trash for us. We didn't even ask for them to do so! We also got a warm goodbye when we left. You can get a hot dog at a few different places but, service in the end will make heads or tails of where you choose to get it. They've got this down. Here's hoping the great service and the good food continue on!",

Reminded me of a burger you would get when you are tailgating with your buddies.  Everything is done with generous portions of cheese, meat, and grilled onions.

Various Michigan teams were well represented with sports memorabilia everywhere and very cool t-shirts for sale.  The service was incredibly friendly and the food absolutely delicious.   I had a nice Vernors Ginger Ale, too.  Ah, it was just like home.  To top it off there is a floor mat at the register, and when I looked down to see what it said, I laughed out loud as it was an Ohio State Buckeye floor mat, all nice and dirty from being stepped on by many Michiganders!!

I'm always in search of Detroit style coney, and rarely have I found any place outside of the great mitten that can even come close. Luckily, I've stumbled across Detroit Coney Grill in Tempe. I ate here for the first time this week and it's the real deal! Faygo pop(not soda), Vernors, and Better Made are all well represented here, but the story is the coney dog! First off, they get the chili right, and if you're a fellow Michigander, you know the difference. The dogs have natural casings that snap but aren't chewy, and the buns are steamed. I had a coney dog, chili cheese fries and Rock N Rye, spent less than $10, and came away with my faith in humanity restored! I plan on becoming a regular and brining my family soon.",

The burgers are perfect, thin patties, topped however you'd like.  But the big draw, the coney dogs!  I understand that the owner gets most product sent in from Michigan for the best authentic Detroit coney taste, but the chili is homemade.  Paired with some fresh-cut french fries, makes a perfect and filling meal!  Occasionally they will have special products such as Superman ice cream, or bumpy cake.  But it's also a great place to go to get some Michigan favorites such as Better Made potato chips, and a few varieties of Faygo, and of course Vernor's.  They also have some T shirts for sale.  Come early, bring your friends and mark your Michigan roots on the giant map!",

The owner was working and took our order..super nice , very \"DETROIT\" kind of guy and you'll know he is there when you see him. He was wearing a DETROIT shirt after all.   Read the ABOUT US section on their website..I LOVE IT! I think there is a typo though, which makes me at ease that it's not a robot typing it...towards the end of it it says \"How are we going that ? \" when its supposed to say (I think) ..How are we DOING that. Otherwise, I loved reading it!   Ordered the Detroit Coney & the Triple Cheeseburger   Detroit Coney & Fries- Holy cow , delicious. Comes with steamed bun, hot dog, onions , mustard and chili. Looks really simple...but its sooooooo good. Definitely one of the best tasting hot dogs I've had. Mind you, its not huge and it doesn't have a million toppings but it's just SOOOOOO good. The chili is what makes this dog, and so is the dog itself! Nice snap to the dog. The fries were fresh, and hand cut. You can really tell it is hand cut. Nice portions too.   Also had the pleasure of tasting the TRIPLE BURGER...mind you it starts with a double...then goes to triple..quad....quint and then some specialties. You need to get the triple if you are looking to fill you up. The Quad is equivalent to a double. The reason is simple...the burgers are freshly grinded ..THEY GRIND THEIR OWN BEEF! The patties are small , and its just the way they do things. Pricing is very reasonable and it's one of the best damn burger's I've ever had. Really simple but just so tasty!   The owner came up to us during our meal and asked how everything was and even shared some business plans. I am hoping they expand to WEST, because they will kill it there. Currently, there is no place like this in San Diego so I am hoping to see one soon.   Thank you for a great meal and great hospitality!",

Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and asked if we had dined there before. Hearing that this was our first time, we were given  a brief but informative run down of the menu. We were left alone for a few minutes to ponder our dinner choice.  We ordered 3 chili dogs, a burger and an obligatory order of fries.  Our expectations were absolutely met once we received our freshly cooked food. The chili was bursting with flavor, the fries were cooked and salted to perfection. The buns were fluffy but not too fluffy where they couldn't hold the ooey gooey contents.  I was truly impressed with every aspect of my dining experience from the superb service to the exceptional food.",

If you enjoy spicy, I recommend trying their Green Chile burger with bacon. Green hatch Chiles from New Mexico really make your mouth tingle with heat. The service was excellent and it's always nice to be greeted by the store owner. He's always so welcoming and makes sure you're enjoying the food. I can't say enough good things about this place. If I were to critique one thing, it would probably be to have more upkeep on the restrooms. They weren't dirty, they just needed some paper towels restocked. Thumbs way up for a great find!",

We asked what we should try and we were told the burger because it's rated 9th best burger IN THE COUNTRY. So we got the double burgers and chili cheese fries. The patties are smashed to super thin and are seasoned perfectly. The buns are a perfect blend of crispy and greasy. Seriously mouth watering burgers. No wonder they are 9th in the country. The chili cheese fries were good, not really anything super crazy or special about them but I would definitely order them again. Kinda like carnival or fair chili cheese fries. Overall this spot is definitely as good as it gets.",

There are no grilled chicken salads, wing dings, corned beef pitas, or breakfast specials. Those are some of the best things from back home that this coney does not sell. Faygos for $2.95 (a total rip off) and tiny bags of bettermade chips for over a $1 (again a total rip off). The food is okay, but could be so much better. Again, for the moment it's all we have. Soon there will be another one with all the fixings. So keep your eyes peeled and your stomach ready. There will be $.99 coney dogs on Wednesday, breakfast specials, wing dings, grilled chicken salads, Fargo pop, chili fries with cheese, real loose burgers and much more. Don't know if it's greed or the fact that he has the monopoly, but the prices are over the top for the food. Best thing on the menu is the chili fries with cheese and sometimes the fries are undercooked. Shame on him for making coney island from the D look bad. People from Arizona would not know the prices are too high, but people from the D know.",

Reasons for 3 star: the hours aren't that great. The thing I loved about coney back home is that many of them are 24 hours and coney is the best after the bar. 2nd reason for 3 star is I'm not a huge fan of the fries. This would be ok if I could buy the chili, but the \"bowl of chili\" on the menu is dine in only, so you're forced to eat their fries if you want chili cheese fries. I mean I understand you may not want your chili put on other peoples' food but what does it matter if I spent my money on  *update: I never said I liked frozen fries like David N. assumed in his reply to my review. I would rather cook my fries at home.",

I have had a few good meals here but my last experience here was probably worth much less than the 3 star rating I have given them. Their usually very good fresh cut fries were under cooked (hard) and greasy. I ordered a burger combo and wanted to trade the soda for a bottle of water. To my surprise I was charged an extra $2 and which made the cost $1.50 more than if I would have ordered everything ala carte. When I attempted to voice my concern to the employee behind the counter he looked at me as if I was a moron and said there was a charge for the upgrade. Evidently he couldn't figure out how to use the cash register so he charged me for the bottle of water as well.  As I was dumping my food in the trash on my way out the door he asked me how my meal was, evidently the genius didn't remember that he had just brought it to my table 3 minutes earlier.",

    "text": "Hmmmm...I just don't get all the rave reviews here.  The food just doesn't seem to rate it, especially at the prices charged.  We came here because we were in the area, wanted some lunch, and YELP has this place at over four stars.  Reading the description I knew this was hotdogs and burgers, and so that was the expectation I went in with.  I wasn't thinking this would be Vintage 95 or the Cordon Bleu or anything of that sort.  It's dogs and burgers.  I get it.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately by either a manager or the owner.  Not sure which, but he acted like he was an owner.  He was very friendly and told us to let him know when we were ready.  So far no problem.  We settled on the daily special (today was two Coney dogs, a fries and a drink).  The Coney dogs are chili dogs, which is cool.  I like chili dogs!  We also got a double burger.  The manager/owner was very friendly, was focused on us while we were placing our order, and even made suggestions.  I took one suggestion and upgraded the fountain drink to one of his craft sodas.  He gave me the soda immediately, and it was really good.  The rest of the order came out pretty quickly.  The chili dogs were chili dogs.  They were fine, but nothing super-duper-fantastic.  Certainly better than someplace like Sonic, no doubt.  It sort of reminded me of the sort of chili dog you might get at a sports stadium from the concession there.  No evidence there was anything special about these dogs (e.g. all-natural, uncured, etc).  They could have been Ballpark Hotdogs for all I could tell.  The fries were basic, but good.  The hamburger initially came out with mayo on it.  We said to hold the mayo.  I don't know who made the error (and I don't care), but the young man I flagged about it seemed a bit surly and annoyed.  He replaced the bun and lettuce, but it seems like such a huge imposition for him.  A stark contrast to the older guy (manager/owner).  The \"double\" was indeed a double, but both patties were very very thin.  Total weight maybe 1/4 lb (and the owner even confirmed this when I asked).  So how did it taste?  Like a stadium concession burger.  Maybe a bit better than that.  But no match for other burgers I have had lately (such as Rocket Burger in Chandler).  I would probably rate the food at 2.5 stars.  It wasn't bad, but I have had better.  It was \"OK\".  I'm bumping to three stars for the very enthusiastic and concerned owner (he asked me a few times how things were), and the good craft sodas they have.    They also are overpriced for what you get, but the specials do help a bit (and there is a YELP check-in coupon).  They beat the heck out of McD's or similar, but they also are a lot more expensive, and frankly not as good as some other burger/dog joints I've tried.",

Halfway through my salad, I found a hair in my salad- not mine. The person I ate with bought the Monday special that had a Detroit coney, a drink, and chili cheese fries. I did not try the dog, but I had some of the fries and it was delicious. The diet drinks were all out when we arrived. After asking them about it two times they finally changed it. They did apologize and gave us two gift certificates to come back and give them another try. We will.",

First, it was our first time in and the guy at the counter was not helpful at all. We could have saved a bunch going with the combo that we found after we ordered, he should have just said they had a combo with what we ordered. Also, we showed him our Yelp check in for the discount they offered and he didn't take the discount off after me asking twice because I thought he hadn't. I checked the receipt and nope no discount. The Coney was good but not great, there is a different spice I thought maybe like a curry... Don't know but it was different. Fries were decent but again nothing great. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but wouldn't complain if someone wanted to go. It was as the line says, Meh. It was also very warm in the restaurant and I am almost always cold.",

I was so satisfied and happy with my experience I might go back tomorrow! I don't know much about the coney culture behind the place but even just as an average customer I would return again.   I got just a plain coney with chili, onions, and light mustard. Hand cut fries and a drink. All of it was simple and tasty as f**k!! My dog was great; a little messy, but still great. The fries were fresh, hot, and salty! YUM! It was perfect and it was what I wanted, and it was cheap.

Chili was on point, Coney dogs had some snap when you bit into them. And of course a great touch with the Faygo and Vernors. My only suggestion to first timers is order anything with the chili on it and you will not be disappointed.",

As an avid burger lover....let me rephrase that, as someone who eats a burger for every other meal and never met a french fry that she didn't like, I gave Detroit Coney Island five stars. The owner told me that I could have my burger any way I wanted it, he encouraged me just to tell him exactly what I wanted versus looking at the menu. The burger was juicy, the seasoning on the fries was zesty and most importantly I didn't leave feeling sick like I often do after eating greasy food. I didn't think anybody could do it better than Inn n Out in terms of a good, fast burger but this place is my new go to - hands down! Even if you don't like the food, the owner (whose name escapes me) is super friendly and very intent on making your dining experience unique. I wish Detroit Coney Island the best of luck in its plans to expand and I know I'll be first in line when theres one in Scottsdale!",

When driving to find a place to eat one day on my lunch I saw the sign that DCG was opening soon (I even went up to the window to see how far along the construction was to gauge to timing).  I waited with anticipation and the day finally arrived.  I took some of my co-workers with me because they did not even know what a coney was.  Being from the Detroit area myself, I had come to appreciate the finer things in life, such as a True Detroit-style coney.  Needless to say my co-workers were very impressed and simply loved my little slice of home.  DCG not only serves the authentic Detroit Coney experience with the hot dog/coney and hand cut fries, but you can also feast on Better Made chips and wash it down with \"real sugar cane\" Faygo POP. Great food and staff make eating at Detroit Coney Grill the highlight of my work week.  Thank you to the owner who finally stepped up and brought a \"real coney\" to Arizona.",

    "text": "In Detroit they call soda 'pop' and chili dogs 'Coneys.' In the Valley, we're hearing the same Motown lingo. The birthplace of Detroit Coney-style hot dogs may be 2000 miles northeast of Arizona, but you can find the same chili, buns, and snappy sausage flavor in a strip mall on Broadway in Tempe.  My consort, Richard, a Michigander, and I mean that literally especially when the Wolverines take the gridiron, has been raving about Coney Island dogs for years. Richard has as much allegiance to Coneys as he has to his University of Michigan team who lost three out of five games this season.  But let's talk about a win. David Najor, a Michigan native expat living in Tempe, has recreated the famous Lafayette Coney Island with an arsenal of Detroit-based ingredients (Vernors, Faygo, and Better Made Potato Chips). His meats are as authentic as they can be, made with all-beef natural casing dogs shipped in from Detroit, burgers from scratch, and hand-cut russet potatoes.  My consort taught me the jargon, \"two with.\" Translation: two Coney dogs with chili, mustard, and onions. If you don't want the onions, just say \"two.\" To order a pop, \"one Faygo\" (orange, grape, or root beer). If you aren't a diggity-dog fan, like myself, order \"chili, hold the wiener.\"  The two foremost purveyors of Coneys in downtown Detroit, American and Lafayette, have embarked on a family feud for generations. I talked to one Lafayette employee who had nothing good to say about his next door neighbors, American Coneys. But as far as the customers are concerned, they divide into two distinct camps. In Tempe, we are lucky--there is only one authentic Detroit Coney.  Our tradition is to celebrate a Wolverine win with a visit to the neighborhood Detroit Grill. We haven't tasted a Coney for two weeks and we're both craving a dog. Our team plays Rutgers next week. Whoever heard of them? I guess they are new to the Big Ten. See you at Coneys after the big win! Go Blue.  I am the DinnerSlut.",

The buns were warm, fresh and steamed. The Detroit dogs were excellent! When you bite into them, they have a nice snap.   I also had a bag of Detroit Better Made potato chips and 1 bottle of Faygo root beer pop. I do hope David can open a spot up north. I give it an  A+. I will come back again!

There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door, it'll be worth it.

The food is as authentic as it gets right down to the taste of the chili and the \"snap\" of the dog when you bite into it (ya'll know about that snap) and the checkered table cloths. Remember its \"pop\" in here and they have Fago and Vernors and the infamous \"Boston Cooler.\"   This place is a slice of Detroit Heaven in Arizona, highly recommend!!",

They even made me a Flint Style coney, all be it with some jabs on how Detroit style is better haha. Just writing this review is making wanting to drive over there right now!

I live in Avondale az so it's a good drive to the spot but it was well worth it. The hot dogs are amazing good in fact there better than some of the coneys back home and that's kinda what it felt like a trip back home. The fago pop, better made chips and the superman ice cream!! All of which I grew up off of made it and awesome experience for me and my family. The owner and  employees were nice and welcoming. So if you are from Detroit looking for some good home eats it's the spot for you and I will be a regular. Hopefully they get to the west valley soon but until than I'll be making that drive...

    "text": "I'll get right to the point, I'm a Michigander so I'm a little bias.  However a tad bit of history research will show you that the Coney Dog (aka Michigan dog) was founded in Jackson MI (THE ORIGINAL CONEY ISLAND) so all you native New Yorkers \"Get outta here!\" (JUST KIDDING, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikihow.com%2FTalk-Like-a-Stereotypical-New-Yorker&s=8eb36e24b73af1d91a62373f3c953231a3a3f210cb3f559ddcea7acd7b5080b6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikihow.com/Talk-Like-a-...</a>).  Of course when I first moved to AZ years ago I was used to natural casing hot dogs (skin dogs).  Unfortunately Arizonian's didn't know what that was as they are familiar with the boring old skinless hot dogs.  Thus began my search for a skin dog in AZ.  After a few years I could occasionally find them in some of the grocery stores in the deli area but I still could not find them in a restaurant.  I started looking up top hot dog places in AZ and would go out of my way to find a skin hot dog but would be left with zilch.  After awhile I decided to give up my search since Arizonian's didn't like the skin dog.  My wife is from Ohio and she doesn't even like them, go figure.  I guess you have to grow accustomed to it but once you like them no other hot dog is ever the same.  Finally a place called Portillo's opened in Tempe and knowing they were from Chicago I decided to give them a try.  I even asked my friend Sam if they had skin dogs and she assured me they did.  I went up to the counter and asked if their hot dogs were skin dogs and they said yes.  However I mistakenly ordered the big hot dog as I didn't know there was a difference and when I got it it was just another SKINLESS hot dog.  I was extremely disappointed and went back to my friend and told her Portillo's does not have skin dogs.  She told me again that they did so we went together the next time so she could prove me wrong.  It turns out they do have skin hot dogs but you have to order the regular hot dog as the bigger one is indeed just skinless.  It was good but something was still missing, THE CHILI PERHAPS?  Well I didn't think I'd be getting True MI chili but another friend of mine (Colin) told me about Detroit Coney Grill as it had just opened.  He asked if I had been there which I hadn't.  One day I decided to visit and low and behold they had Better Made chips by the register!  I knew I was on to something because Better Made is made in Detroit.  These are NOT your salty Lays!  So I started talking to the owner about the hot dogs and he explained they were skin dogs.  PEOPLE THEY ALSO HAVE CURLY FRIES LIKE MI!  I began eating the hot dog but wasn't expecting the chili to taste like MI chili BUT IT WAS!  The coney dog is just like back home, chili and all.  So IMO there is nothing better than a hot dog from DETROIT.  Detroit Coney Grill also has good burgers but that's not why I come, GET THE CONEY DOG!",
