My family and I have had some of the pasta plate which are good but we always come back for the pan crust pizza. My husband loves the selection of beer and enough TVs to watch whatever game is playing. The service is good. So far all the staff has been great each and every time we come in.  Don't forget dessert! PIZOOKIES",

    "text": "Food has always been above average here but the manager here (tall, older man) isn't so friendly! Have a seat, here is why:  Being the techies we are we were excited to see that they had a mobile app now where you can pay your check with Apple Pay! The waiter dropped off the ticket but all we had to do was pull up our table number, check out, and was emailed the receipt fairly quickly.  I then opened the check on the table and noticed a different amount than what I had paid. The waiter simply forgot to add on an extra Coke and did so last minute that it didn't update in the app. I notified the waiter and was thinking all we owed was the extra $3 for the soft drink and would have been fine paying that separately. The waiter went to see what was going on but the manager returned. He started by suggesting possibly doing a second charge on the physical card to see if it actually went through and if I ended up getting charged twice then they'd refund one. I frowned upon that simply because I'm not going to make another large charge on my card just to \"see what happens\". I pulled up the receipt that was emailed to me by BJ's showing everything I paid for, it was just short the $3 drink.   The manager then sat down next to me at our booth, without asking, to look at my phone. I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable because there was really no room for him so his arm and leg were brushing right up against mine. It was so unprofessional and a complete invasion of privacy and I shot a horrified look at my boyfriend on the other side. Quickly I showed him the email on my phone hoping he would be satisfied and move away from me, but it was like he had never seen an email like that before...I had to explain that it was sent front BJ's and where it said I used Apple Pay.  I even offered to show him my bank account...something I shouldn't have to do or feel that I should defend myself with but we weren't going to be painted as thieves. At this point he was still rudely hovering over my phone I had to obviously turn my phone away so he wouldn't see me entering in my credentials. He finally got the hint and got up to go check to see if it was showing as paid in the system yet.  I pulled up my account and sure enough it was showing as being taken out and pending, it was incredibly awkward once again to have to show a view of my account transactions and prove we were not trying to skip out on the check. Sorry but I'm not going to charge my card again when we have all kinds of proof showing we've paid and we weren't trying to screw anyone over. The manager simply said \"well it's not showing as cleared so I'm just going to have to eat the check...\" and as I was about to speak he walked off without another word.  We just sat there in silence for a bit as the manager stared at us from the front desk.   Sir...you're not \"eating the check\" as you passive aggressively stressed to us. You got paid, the money didn't just go into oblivion from my bank account, the BJ email receipt confirmed it, you were just short $3 for the Coke which we were happy to pay for on a different ticket.  The waiter, a kinder soul, came back a few minutes later and I gave him the quick rundown of what happened because I certainly didn't want him getting the blame for the last minute addition. He went back to check the register and BOOM it was now cleared and he said that we were all good. It just took a little time to get updated apparently but the manager clearly lost his cool early and lacked a sense of boundaries with customers.   After an already long day and wanting to just sit down and get a good meal somewhere nice it was a real disappointment to then be hassled for something that was no fault of our own. We were the ones that brought up the issue and asked what we could do to remedy it not expecting the manager and how we'd ultimately get treated. I was just happy to be done with something that could have easily been solved...a measly $3!!! It wasn't that hard.  Will be reaching out to corporate regarding the personal space issue though, an apology from the manager would have been nice at least as we left.   We've come here for many birthdays and get togethers, however this customer experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be recommending this place again.",

It was about 20 minutes for 3 of us to get our first order of soft drinks... 30 minutes had gone by the time we got our appetizer.  We tried to get our waiter flagged down but he was either no where or at other tables quite a way from our section.    We caught a passing waitress and complained, She was great, she took stock of what we were missing, and promptly brought us our refills and the beer that was ordered.   1 hour had past and now we had long eaten our appetizer and drank our drinks.  Our food arrived and was good.   Our waiter came over and apologized for the mix up, their computers had crashed.  2 of us ordered 3rd refills.   They didn't turn up, just the bill with the manager who apologized for the late food, late drinks, slow service.. but offered nothing in compensation.     The bills were wrongly split but we just exchanged cash between us and left vowing never to return.   I have been to BJs in 3 states and I have been to this location before, the service was never this bad.",

My boyfriend and I ordered the sliders with cheese & bacon along with the carnitas fries w/ chile verde. The mini burgers were so juicy and delicious! The carnitas fries were so flavorful. They use the shoestring fries but there was one wedge cut fry in there too and it was very tasty! My only complaint was they had onions on top and I didn't know that when ordering, so we had to scoop them off. We had the same server as last time and he did a great job, with the exception of our waters going dry during dessert. We got the Pizookie trio with pumpkin, cookies & cream, and chocolate chunk! Really good meal. 4.5 stars rounds to 5!",

Everyone was happy with their meal but my dad. Poor him. He ordered the Chowder Bowl and got only the bowl. They were very apologetic and said he could keep the bowl while they prepared one for him in the bowl. What came next was a shock. They really over baked the bread bowl and it was dark near burnt and very crusty. They should never have delivered to the table. I got the the spicy pig pizza and my wife got the old country tomato basil. She ordered extra artichoke. Just a little advice When someone orders an extra topping out it on top so they can see it. At first she returned it because you could not really see but it was there and she did enjoy. We got biegnets for dessert and there were very good.   Service was excellent and attentive. For the type of restaurant I thought the ambiance was nice.  A little more quality control could bring this place to a top choice among the sports bar type restaurants.",

We took some time to look at the pretty large menu & decided on getting something off of the lunch menu. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & hubby ordered Buffalo Wings.  Food came out quickly & piping hot.  My chicken breast was delicious but very small, which I guess isn't a bad thing since it's just lunch.  The country gravy served with the chicken is delicious & their shoestring french fries are so crispy & flavorful! I think I could make a meal out of their fries & gravy, actually! We decided to try their pizookie sampler & chose peanut butter, oreo & salted caramel. Omg. I'm salivating thinking about those little pizza pans of awesomeness.  They were warm & oh so delicious. PB was our favorite :)  When it was time to pay my husband realized he left his wallet at home, no biggie, I have mine...wait (digs thru purse)...no...no I don't. Crap. So we're sitting there & my husband says he will go all the way home & get it.  Luckily, I glanced over at the little BJ Rewards sign at our table & noticed it says that if you sign up for their rewards program you can pay your bill with your phone! Whoa. Talk about perfect.  So we did & thank goodness because I really wasn't looking forward to sitting at the table awkwardly while my husband went back home ;)  We'll definitely be back for dinner & drinks because their beer & drink menu looked pretty neat!",

I picked up a Carrabas and one to BJ's since we had never been there.  Our friends did tell us that they liked it so I thought, why not.    We stopped in for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar.  We were greeted as soon as we sat down by the bartender who took his time to go over the menu and the beer selections.  We did sample a few different beers and they were good.  The menu is very complete and looked good.  We decided to try a sampler plate and a couple of side salads.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.    I am sure we will return again.   It was a great experience and total cost for \"lunch\" and \"some\" adult beverages was under $40.00",

We show up with 5 mins to spare and were told we would be seated in 5 mins...right on time. Only 5 mins in BJs time is 25 mins! At the 15 min mark I asked how much longer it would be, but was told they simply \"don't really know\". While waiting for our table we were repeatedly told by the staff how tired they were.   Once seated I was firmly told by the waitress that they do NOT have Dr. Pepper, Pibb, or anything similar! They were awful proud of their root beer! :(. I hate root beer.   My wife and I decided to split a large bacon cheese burger pizza at the reasonably low price of $24!!! Although the pizza was good, by no means was it worth that much. Way too greasy, and although we asked for no tomatoes, they seemed to put double the norm. It would have been sent back, but again BJs time is about double normal time.   I wanted to like this place, but the experience was just too poor to even give them a second chance. Take a pass if your in the Park West / Westgate area!",

They also have tons of beer in draft but nothing you would usually see anywhere. But if you want a boring standard beer, your waiter will recommend something close but craft. They are so knowledgeable with their beers it's refreshing. Then, order the deep dish buffalo pizza. The hot sauce they put on there isn't your normal Franks Red Hot Sauce. It's kinda sweet, mild and tangy. Dessert? Save room for the pazookie!!! Mushy baked cookie right to your table. Amazing. And they're open late and everyone is friendly..",

    "text": "My one star rating has nothing to do with the food, which was very good, and everything to do with the manager of the evening, Amber, during our experience at BJ's on Saturday, July 16.  We were coming to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend.  I phoned ahead to get on the list for a table.  I specifically requested a table because my husband and I have disabilities that limit our movement and make it nearly impossible to maneuver ourselves into and out of a booth.  The hostess assured me that a table would be made available for us.  When my buzzer went off, Amber said our space was ready, but that it was a booth.  I explained that we required a table and she insisted that the booth can accommodate us because of the pullout section for seating.  As we approached the booth we saw an empty table for 4 and asked why we could not have that space.  She explained that she needed it and that as soon as the people in the table next to that one left, she would be setting it up for someone else.  Mind you, the people at the other table were in no way ready to move on and had settled in nicely for a good dinner with friends.  We sat down at the empty table and refused to get up because the space was available for us and we wanted that space for our dinner.  Amber was extremely rude and upset that we would not take the booth and kept repeating to us that she \"needs that table\".  The hostess attempted to give us our menus and Amber told her \"NO\" because she \"needs that table\".  Along comes the waitress assigned to the table, Christa, and we explained to her what was going on.  She was a delight and offered to get us something to drink while the table fiasco was sorted out.  Seeing that the table next to us was clearly not leaving, we asked her to bring us menus and we ordered our appetizer and dinner.  To be clear, an hour later that group next to us was still enjoying their time together.  I don't know what Amber's issue was, but she needs some intense training on customer service as she could not have been more rude and unprofessional if she tried.  We have never had an experience like this at BJ's, nor any other restaurant we've dined at.  We thank Christa for her excellent service and enjoyed our dinners.  It will, however, be some time before we frequent the Peoria location again.",

We have eaten at BJ's in Huntington Beach, CA and AZ does not even come close to being the same quality.  I will give them another chance, but definitely won't order the pulled pork sandwich.

We started with the buffalo wings and calamari. Their wings are my favorite. Their buffalo sauce has so much flavor and not too hot.  Got the ribeye which was delicious especially for not being a steakhouse. My family got the prime rib sandwich, buffalo chicken grill cheese, chicken club, and jambalaya. Everything was amazing!

The food and service is always good, but a little pricey. The portions are always huge though so you will never leave hungry.   They have a large bar with a lot of TVs, liquor, and beer. The bartenders have always been friendly and offer good service.",

We started with the extreme pepperoni flat bread. It was so good! Crispy crust, two different style pepperonis! It wasn't too greasy and it was quite large.  We then split their crispy chicken sandwich! That bun.... It was so light and airy! It had pickle and the best honey mustard sauce ever. The chicken was so crispy! Last but definitely NOT least was dessert. I can honestly say that I have found my new most favorite dessert ever. Drum roll please...... The peanut butter smore cookie was the absolute best! It was a chocolate cookie with peanut butter and then toasted marshmallow on top!!!! Oh. My. Gosh!! It was so sweet but I couldn't stop eating it! It was SO SO good!  Just dreaming about it now makes my crave it! I can't wait to go back!!",

Our waitress was nice, however other things were lacking. We were sat in the complete back corner of the restaurant directly outside of the break area for the employees. At one point someone spilled their drink on the table and all over themselves and the waitress didn't come back for at least 20 minutes while they had to wait standing in water. I think other places have more to offer so I dont know if I'll be back at this point.",

Patient enough to let us chit chat but still attentive with refills and orders. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad and it was fantastic! Chicken was moist and all the flavors blended really well together. The group of us split the appetizer combo platter and... please stay away from the avocado rolls. They are mushy and just about flavorless. There is no contrast in texture... adding chicken or corn or anything in addition to avocado would have truly elevated the roll.  Now... on a serious note desert. The seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie is FANTASTIC. Now, I swore whenever I came here to always get my favorite classic, chocolate chip. But, the girls forced me to try something new and I now have a new favorite! The flavor is out of this world, and when combined with the ice cream, dare I say.. life changing. lol. Do yourself a favor and order this!",

Even though it was cooked to perfection it had ZERO flavor to it. The couscous Mac and cheese was... weird and the insane amount of broccoli seemed like they were warmed and not cooked. My wife's steak was the same. The ceasar salad leaves seemed like they still had dirt on them since they were very grainy. Her potatoes were fine however. My sons apple sauce and fried chicken were fine... kinda hard to mess that up.  You get a solid 1 Star because low quality food do not meet your high quality prices.",

I have visited this location before and love bringing the wife for dinner dates. The food is always good. However I cannot recommend the deep dish pizza. Mondays are half off pizza so I ordered the classic combo and it was very disappointing. The crust was thick, nice and soft, but the toppings were terrible. The crust is so thick you have to overcook the toppings to finish the dough. It was so bad the sauce was dried under the cheese and the amount of oil/grease used in the pan is insane. It is rare that I throw away pizza but this one is in the trash. I will continue to visit, just will never try the pizza again.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of BJ's since the late 90's when I first started going to the one in West Covina, CA.  Of course it's reasonable to expect menu changes from time to time and I have never been disappointed in the food quality.  This location can be a real chore to park at, and it's not uncommon to have to circle the lot for 15 minutes at dinnertime to find even a far spot.  I have always been a Brewhouse Blonde Fish and Chips fan, even through its changes throughout the years, and my last trip here was no exception.  My favorite beer is the Brewhouse Blonde and I can drink those for days.  The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my next favorite item and luckily for me, DW always orders it so I can sneak a bite or two.  Service last time I was there was a bit lacking as our server wan't completely focused on our orders.  After taking our drink orders, she bolted off before we could order any appetizers.  Once she came back around, we ordered up some Pepperoni Extreme and Margherita Fresca pizzas for our appetizers and off she went to put in the order.  When the order came out, we got the pepperoni, but a California Club pizza instead of the Margherita.  I guess this is what happens when servers don't write down your order.  I get it, servers have bad days, so there's no animosity here or malice there, and the rest of our order came back fine.  Our server could have checked in a few more times for refills but like I said, she was probably having a bad day, or was just about to clock out.    It looked like a new menu since the last time I dined here, but my faves were still there.  BJ's was it's normal good self, but maybe its magic is starting to wear off for me.  It's a solid four stars for the food and the iffy service didn't make it lose any stars; it's just that this place isn't as great for me now as it was when I was in my twenties.  I miss the clam chowder and the chicken lettuce wraps.  Call ahead seating saves time and I wish all restaurants would do this.  Plenty of TVs all around the restaurant to keep abreast of the local and national sports teams.  I will definitely come back and recommend this place.",

Usually it's better than that. We waited so long for our food that we asked the server where it was and asked for the check with the food. Way too long.

    "text": "I typically love this restaurant. I recently used their app to order food to be delivered. The app was very easy to use but I was charged twice. I called the store to ask them about it and spoke to a man. He said that he can't see anything yet because it is sent through Uber Eats first then sent to them. I asked him if I should call back after it's delivered. He said yes but he would talk to the manager to see if they know why it's happening and he would call me back if he found anything out. The food was delivered and was great. I called back and asked for a manager. They got the manager on the phone and I told him what happened and that I called earlier. He said that he was the person I talked to earlier and he is still only showing one charge. I was a little confused because when I called the first time he told me he has to talk to a manager and now he's saying he's a manager. He said to wait a few days to see if one of the charges drops off and if it doesn't to call back. I'm hoping this gets figured out but I'm a little bothered by getting the runaround. I really don't want to pay $80 for a $40 meal!",

Easy access and lots of parking.  To be honest, I have only ever had drinks and appetizers here. One time it was late night (after 10 PM) and the place was pretty empty. Great service that night. The other time it was happy hour on a Saturday. CROWDED!! and service was slow, but only because our server had tons of tables to deal with.  Overall, I like the food. We had flatbread pizzas, artichoke dip and sliders. Not bad bar food. The place is nice, clean and large.",

Get yourself the Chocolate Raspberry combo drink with some stout and raspberry beer (I can't find it on their online menu, but check it out for sure).  It doesn't matter how many people have already said it...their pizookies need to happen at the end of your meal!

    "text": "Ok, first I would like to add we have been eating at BJ's (my wife, kids and I) since they opened. We live right up the street and frequent Park West about once a week for dinner and a movie. In the beginning when I very first tried BJ's, they had one of the best burgers I have ever had! I could tell they used high quality beef, quality ingredients- a delicious bun, and were prepared superb. The appetizer was also delicious and original, an avocado egg roll with a delicious dipping sauce. I have also tried the roast beef french dip which was excellent and a chicken tortilla soup to die for. That is why it's such a bummer when the last few times I've been there it has been extremely inconsistent.   When its good its really good, when it's bad, the service is horrible and the food has been lousy. However I never stop going to a place I like so much off of one bad food experience. Upon returning to see if it is really gone downhill like I feared, we were actually pleasantly surprised with our meals. So chalking it up as just an off day, we have gone back several times. I don't know what is going on, maybe it has to do with the manager who may be working at the time, or kitchen staff / wait staff, but it seems to oscillate from being one of my favorite places to go, to extremely poor food and service. When we're looking for a quick bite to eat and don't feel like cooking we'll stop by and have lunch or dinner, but unfortunately it is just too inconsistent. Their drink menu is awesome, and have plenty of microbrews to try. Myself being a fan of root beer, enjoys' their homemade root beer and my children often order they're orange creamsicle soda which is very delicious. They usually order off the children's menu, and the sliders offered on that menu are quite tasty.    The only reason I decided to write a review for BJ's is I honestly hope management can fix the inconsistencies with their dining experience. When their game is tight, it truly is one of my favorite chain restaurants. With how close they are to our house, I look forward to many more years of dining at BJ's,  and would even drive several miles extra to dine there if I had to because it is just that good (when it's good). It makes me very nervous that they will become just like so many other really good restaurants that start out delicious only to have a gradual descent into mediocrity. I just hope they do not become complacent being average, because their food is so much more when they do go the extra mile. I would gladly give 5 stars if the issues I stated above can be rectified.",

If you are from the Chicago area or have ever visited, do not order this deep dish!  There is hardly any sauce and the dough is about an inch thick through the entire pizza.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and I was not impressed.  The noodles were overdone and squishy and most of the dish was very bland.",

We walk in and the host was alright. Made it seem like she didn't really cared. \"How many\" okay thanks\" and so we then asked what the wait was \"oh it'll be 10\" minutes. Then immediately turned around to talk to her friend who was up there with her. Hm okay well thanks host because of you're rudeness it isn't a 5 Star.   As for the service from our Waitress and the manager. So awesome.  Our waitress name was Laryn A. And she was absolutely amazing! The second she walked up to the table to the second we were leaving.  Her menu knowledge, her amazing table humor, and communication and makes us feel so comfortable and welcome. We order quit a lot and some drinks. Accompanied everything we needed and asked with a smile.  She later then brought our my sister birthday ice cream and brownie. And brought some boxes. And we were leaving the table we left so satisfied and with full stomachs and laughing smiles. Thank you Laryn for making our night out we don't do often absolutely worth it! When we go back we will request you!  As for the manager. Not to sure what his name was didn't catch that, but he was very attentive kind and catering to all tables and needs.  Thanks for the awesome experience at you're Local BJ's. So worth it!",

I would normally complain and say a restaurant should specialize in something, but in my 4 visits, I haven't had anything that was good.   Burgers, salads, flatbreads... even pasta, all were solid.   Only reason for four stars is because it feels a little too-\"chainy\" but that is unavoidable. Certainly a step up from TGI Fridays and Applebees, but the over the top menu and decor just don't do it for me.  Service has always been exceptional and the facility is perfect for large parties, prices are competitive, and I will definitely be back, especially when I cannot decide what I'm really in the mood to eat!",

    "text": "Something for Everyone  I've been to a handful of BJ's Restaurants and have never been disappointed with my dining experience. However, the BJ's Restraunt and Brewery in Peoria is my favorite.  BJ's has high ceilings, long bars, mix of tables and booths, and large flat screne TV's within viewing distance of all. I can honestly say, I truly enjoy the ambiance at BJ's.  The menu at BJ's is varried, offering a large selection of beers, cocktails, and entree's, there is something for everyone at BJ's. If you can't find something at BJ's to eat,  then you don't like to eat.   The burgers at BJ's are delicious and one of my favorite entree's, but if burgers are not your thing, BJ's offers plenty of other options.  The Thyme-Lemon Chicken and Steaks are amazing and grilled to perfection, with a  a bit of char, tender, and so flavorful.  Service is reliable and well-timed. The staff is very accomdating without being intrusive.  Table or bar seating are all good and their to-go service works well, too.  If your looking for a nice dining expeirence give BJ's Restraunt and Brewery a try, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place is SO hit or miss(mostly miss), their menu items are delicious but only when they are made properly. Example: I LOVE their watermelon feta salad but my husband just brought it home for me to go after a long day.  1. There was no mint 2. There was no arugula  3. They sent olive oil instead of the citrus vinaigrette  4. There was only one chunk of watermelon and a couple of pieces of tiny tid bits.  It was almost nothing like what I had a week ago dining in    We live about a mile away and we usually just go to yard house because BJs is just too inconsistent with their food. My husband and I do NOT like to make a fuss over little things but there have been a few times that we sent our food back at BJs. I've gotten a hair in my food, taken it out and kept eating, so saying that we have sent our food back is saying a LOT for us. I just can't understand why the kitchen would send food out that only halfway matches the menu description  or is obviously burnt(different occasion at BJs) unfortunately it's late and I'm not dining in so I just ate my disappointing salad .",

This operation is pretty much flawless!  Soooo has the prime rib special twice now and the words out of my mouth to my wife were both times this is some of the best I've ever tasted. Ribs moist and delicious. Pizza phenomenal. If your reading this considering this place.  JUST DO IT! I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!",

They offer a large variety of beers including a lot of locally brewed beers. They have booths and tables that you can wait to be seated as well as a bar area that is first come first serve. I've been here a handful of times and have never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  The environment is nice for a date after a movie or just a place to hang with friends to catch a game. They have a decent amount of TV's by the bar.   Make sure you save room for dessert as they have some amazing pizookies! Also if you want to try something different try their Avocado Egg rolls one of my favorite!",

    "text": "Great service, probably the best service I have had from a restaurant of then venue for some time.  The atmosphere spectacular, personal service of the waitress fantastic, food way over rated.  Extremely over priced, appetizers (avocado rolls and queso with chips) you can count the chips on one hand and the queso was a granulated cheese sauce, just horrible.  The rolls, I don't know how to explain them.  The pizza, 5, FIVE pepperonis, mini sausage pieces (hint pieces=small like Reese's pieces).  No cheese to speak of, just crust.  The savior that helped us get thru the experience, the Root Beer, now that was good!  The birthday cookie and ice cream, if it wasn't free, I would have never ordered it for $8, maybe $5, just extremely small and paper thin cookie.  My advice BJ's, go to Costco, and try their pizza and mirror that with deep dish, then you may have something.  If you are wondering why we or I didn't inform the waitress of our experience, we were trying to enjoy the company we had and because there were so many issues, it would have ruined our time together, so we just went with it and chalked it up to going to the wrong place.  I start for atmospherre and Root Beer and a full star for service.",

Everything was wonderful...from the easy online ordering to the friendly driver, Rochelle, to the really nice packaging of their delivered food.  Also, the food was still hot and very good!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I had ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was supposed to come with creamy horseradish...there wasn't any.  But, it was still tasty and I ate the whole thing.  We will definitely order from y'all again...it was a pleasant experience all around.",

However note that prime rib is served medium rare, so if your someone who like well done order something else plus dessert here is awesome! Get the monkey bread, so much better than the cookies.",

After ordering chips and salsa and a round of hand crafted sodas for the table it took a while for the server to come back to take our order. The chips and salsa arrived and the chips were crispy and delicious, the salsa was pretty good as well although we found multiple french fries swimming in the bottom of it, the only thing that would have made them better was more chips as we ate all of the them within 5 minutes of receiving the plate. Next the salads came out and both were tasty, no complaints there. Then we waited for a long time for our food to come out..... My husbands ribs were hot but over done. They were chewy and the outside was crispy and hard to eat. I ordered the ziti, which was not the smallest I've seen but not huge either. The noodles were okay but some were either undercooked or burnt because they were very crunchy. The sauce was pretty tasty but not much better than a store bought and there was so little meat that I could hardly find it. Finally, our server took forever to bring us our check making our time at the table over an hour. Overall the entire experience was less than great and it did not make me feel like returning anytime soon.",

My favorite was the heffe.    We had a bunch of appetizers... the avocado rolls are FLIPPING AWESOME!!! The just blind you with their awesomeness. (lol I love that Kung Fu Panda movie)  We also had the lettuce wraps, which were ok, and the chips and salsa.  The salsa was great... good texture and just the right spicyness to not kill you.  Then after that we all had the Mediterranean pizza... it was GREAT.  That was probably THE THICKEST pizza I have seen in my life, without having the huge crust of a deep dish.  Incredibly good.  Service was good with the waitress.  She was attentive and nice.  The only thing that was bad was they advertised the pumpkin ale, and they had run out for the season.

I was with someone and we were literally one of the first people in the door at 11am and didn't get our food for a good 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and not once did the server come over to apologize as the restaurant filled up and other patrons came and left after already eating. After finally getting food he just dropped it in front of us, cold and walked away. I have been a server before and I think that's why it bothered me the most, knowing what I would have done in his situation, at least apologizing for the wait or even sending over a manager. I was late getting back to my office due to coming in at 11am and not able to leave until 1230 after shoveling the food in my mouth. I would come back, but if I had the same server, ask for someone else.",

    "text": "I come here way too often with my family and friends. You could literally be in the mood for anything and go here. The menu is a tad too big for me, but if you can't decide what you want to eat when choosing a restaurant, you can choose from the huge selection they have. I stick to the few things I know I like here and don't worry about the rest of the menu. Food is pretty good, nothing to rave about, but it's better than most restaurants out there. The best dish I've had was a pulled pork burger as those are my two of my favorite foods put together. Would probably still go with a real barbecue place, but this sufficed for my hamburger craving. My favorite part is the pizzokies, though. They have so many different flavors in which I still have some to try, but the awesome thing is they have a pizookie the size of a large pizza. I had this one time with a group of friends for someone's birthday and with seven of us we couldn't even finish it! Definitely a fun experience and let us indulge for the night. If you drink beer, definitely a place for you. Their selection is huge and from what my friends have said the taste is great (I don't like beer so I can't be a contender in tasting). Overall, great place.",

    "text": "So, as you all know, BJ's is an unfortunately named chain restaurant. I went last night with the BF and his parents as it was his mom's birthday and that's where they wanted to go. It was actually a pleasant surprise! We all got drinks, I had the skinny -rita, which was really good, tart and fresh tasting. The BF got a snakebite, which was, as always, delicious. For dinner, I had the soup and salad with a caesar salad and tortilla soup. Going the 'healthy' route (I know this was not healthy in any way). The soup was very good and flavorful. They serve it 'fancy' style, putting chicken, avocado, tortilla, cheese, and bell pepper in the bottom of a bowl and then pouring the broth over the bowl table side. Nice touch. The salad was fair. Everyone else reported that they enjoyed their entrees. We had pizzookie for dessert, a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, delish. All of this for only 80$...pretty good deal. My only complaints are minimal and include: I wish they offered half portions at discounted prices....the portion sizes are way too big and there were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but I wouldn't order them because I didn't want such a large portion. Also, this restaurant is busy and the wait to eat here is a little over the top....I wish that they took reservations. Overall, this place was good, especially for a chain.",

The place was fairly crowded for a Sunday afternoon and they only had one bartender. She got very backed up and my Dad had to wait a good fifteen minutes for his martini. I ordered a Diet Coke which came out flat.   We ordered chips and salsa to start, which were originally delivered to the wrong table. When we asked for a refill (as indicated by the menu) it took a while and they only brought out a half plate of chips and no salsa.   We opted to go elsewhere for our lunch instead of continuing to torture ourselves.   Note to BJ's: I don't live here and I'm not interested in getting anything for free or you doing anything else for me to \"make it right.\" This is just a warning to others to take your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "We stopped this evening since we were both hungry and wanted to catch the football game. My other half was a bit disappointed since we missed the first game and had a training session instead for Super Bowl volunteers, since I thought this would help with the football withdrawal and it did. Bad part: We were seated in an area that had several large parties that left and  being cleaned up and ready set for two more large parties.   Waited for 10-15 minutes trying ALL the wait staff in our area to get something to drink. Of course they all walked by as if I wasn't seen. The one server that was supposed to have our table wouldn't acknowledge we were there even if I was naked. Too bad she was the same girl complaining to her boss when we got there about too much work. She wasn't very quiet about it. Good part: Jessica saw me trying to get attention and greeted us and asked if she could get the drinks since the other girl was busy.   Apparently she was assigned or agreed to serve us since after she brought drinks and she let us know she was taking out table. She was friendly and attentive.  Kept the refills coming on the mock tail tea I decided to try. The pizza was smaller than I expected but on second thought was a blessing since it left room for dessert.. Can we say Beignet time? The hubs had the bacon cheeseburger and a Light Switch beer. Almost finished it too but it was well not medium as ordered, cold bun and not skinny fries but the wedges as he wanted but he was too hungry to send it back. The Beignet was yum...I love those things.  Someday  I hope to visit New Orleans for one there. I rate this location a 3 because we have always had great service and food in prior visits but a 2 for this evening and Jessica was a 10.",

So you're probably wondering why I'm giving it 2 stars if we apparently didn't eat here.  This review is solely based on service, or lack thereof.  We walked in and there were 5 people ahead of us at the check-in desk.  When we walked out more than 5 minutes later, the same 5 people were still in line.  There were 3 people behind the desk.  One was on the phone, and I'm not really sure what the other 2 were doing.  I thought one was talking to the first guest in line, but then she turned and was doing who knows what and the line still wasn't moving.  If a place is that busy and has a long line of people wanting to check-in, they need to make it a priority to address their guests - don't ignore them.",

The first time we went, they got our food order wrong.  That was ok, no big deal.  The second time, our food came out cold and the service was lacking.  So we didn't come back for some time.  This last time when our food was delivered, we were doing good but the server didn't come back to refill our drinks or check with us or anything.  The food here has the potential to be really great but if the service is lacking, nobody will want to eat here which is odd because the place always looks like it's busy.  If you do go, I hope you get a good server that is attentive and brings out your food on time but as for us, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon or recommend this place to anyone.",

I sent one cough syrupy drink back, and had an equally syrupy top shelf margarita. We spent too much money to be treated like we're visiting Costco.

Dealing with a mobility scooter can be difficult especially when areas are packed with people who don't see you. The food was perfect and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and staff busy but cheerful. Tony our server was very sweet and attentive as much as possible with as busy as it was. I was very impressed with how everything turned out for our Father's Day dinner. I will most definitely be returning. I highly recommend this place.",

Some menu items are fabulous, they have the best chicken wings in the valley in my opinion. Also there cheeseburger pizza is great without some items for me (pickles onions) The salads are always fresh, the chili size is good, the pot roast is some of the best I have ever had! On the contrary, The club sandwich is soggy and gross, and the meat taste really cheap and store bought. The wedge is kinda plain, and other items could be better.The beer is good with lots of different choices. But it is super cold in there sometimes even when it's 65 outside it's 60 on the inside, so bring a sweater for your bj expierience.  (by the way this is way cheaper than yardhouse, with food nearly on the same level)",

    "text": "We've dined at BJ's many times and had both decent and not-so-decent experiences. I doubt we'll be back after this last time. There were four of us and we had appetizers, cocktails, dinners, and dessert. One of the entrees came with soup or salad and tortilla soup was ordered. When it arrived it was barely luke warm. By the time our server, Lacee, came around we told her that the soup was cold and asked if it could be reheated. She took it away without a word but before she returned all of our entrees arrived. When she got back with the soup she started to pour the broth over the dry ingredients without even asking if we still wanted it since we were already eating our dinners. When we said that we no longer wanted it because our dinners were already there, she rolled her eyes, made a face, and left the table while we were still talking to her. The rest of the meal was uneventful, the food was adequate although certainly not exceptional. The server tried to be more friendly towards the end of the meal but never once apologized for the cold soup. On our way out we stopped to tell the manager (according to the receipt the manager was April) what had happened and she could not have been more unconcerned. She smiled and listened but made no apologies nor did she even mention anything about talking to the server about the rolling of the eyes and the face she made. She obviously didn't care that her customers were less than satisfied. This is not the first time that we've had what I would consider poor service for the caliber of restaurant. Between mediocre food and mediocre service we won't be returning which is sad because it's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu.",

The fries were fairly decent. The calamari was mostly stuck together so it was rushed to be fried at once, rather than making sure it's not one ball of octopus.The dessert was ok, for a first time visit wasn't bad.

Our server took the pork to cook it longer and left the sides for him to eat. By the time the pork came back out, he had eaten all his sides and didn't have anything to eat with the pork. On Tuesday wine is 1/2 off, however when we received our bill it was full price. Our server fixed it, but frustrating that if we wouldn't have noticed that we would have been charged the full price.",

No one else in our group had any trouble. Since he had no other food different from the rest of us, we were convinced it was something in the Caesar salad.

    "text": "Matzo or pizza crust? Look at picture and try to guess.... I was lured in by the promise of 1/2 price pizza Mondays only to find out it was only for the Large pan or for the Tavern Cut, so that was disappointment #1. Disappointment #2 was they won't offer Happy Hour pricing if you sit in the dining room, which is separated from the bar seating by a half-wall and since the bar seating was full, there wasn't any choice unless we wanted to wait. Why would an establishment not be happy to please patrons wanting full meals and drinks rather than just drinks? Disappointment #3 was not being offered any beer samples and I had to keep running up to the blackboard to see what the guest taps were because they were written in florescent chalk with fancy lettering that made it impossible to see from across the room and there were no lists at the table. Was glad they had local breweries like Freak'n though--that is a good thing. I ordered the brewhouse classic tavern cut, which is a flatbread style, but not a thin and slightly chewy, flavorful beer infused dough with a charred bottom as I've had at other places, but something that tasted like dry flavorless cardboard and when I flipped it over, it resembled a matzo (see the picture--matzo is on the left). The toppings of sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni were not evenly distributed and the pepperoni pieces were so thin they were partially disintegrated and the mushrooms and sausage crumbles were meager.  My friend's top sirloin was smaller and much thinner than a filet mignon size and he struggled to cut it. Small portion of mashed potatoes and broccoli that was well prepared, but no roll like one would expect with a meal such as this. Disappointment #4 was that although the dining area was sparsely populated, they corraled us into one part of it so that we were sandwiched between a booth with a rambunctious child playing peek-a-boo over the top of the booth, and a loud talking foursome. Disappointment #5 we were given straws with our waters although we didn't ask for them--please be more environmentally conscious. The venue itself is very pleasant so I hope they can take note and improve as it has great potential.",

    "text": "So, this was an interesting experience.  First of all, I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants with massive menus.  Now, that being said, the experience was OK.  I had the spicy pig, which was good, but made incorrectly.  When asked to fix the order, the waiter brought back the same, burnt, flatbread with the added topping, uncooked, place on top.  Now the topping was only pineapple, so there was no issue with this being raw.    My server was nice, but I have to say my table was shocked when we found out he had been there a year.  He was very wrinkled and did not seem to know the menu well.  He brought me back my flatbread in that condition and then asked if it was OK or if it should be remade.  I just feel that it was not the experience I would expect from a high end Chain.",

    "text": "First of all, I'm totally guilty of chuckling at the innuendos. You bastards really bring out my inner 8th grader. I came here during happy hour with a group of around 15, and I'm always pleased to see my large group accommodated. I was informed that during happy hour, all mini pizzas were 1/2 off. I wasn't that hungry, and I'm always hyped for new foods, so I snatched up a menu and looked at the options. I stuck with the BJ's favorite (pretty much the works) and even paired it with their recommended red ale.  The pizza was just so-so. I loved the buttery, deep dish crust, but the toppings were just warm or room temperature, like half of them were thrown on after the pie was already done. Dislike. The beer was spot on, but subsequent requests for adult beverages were met with a suspicious delay...and then the manager came out to make sure all was well. She seems very reluctant to serve alcoholic beverages, as opposed to other restaurants in the same price range that encourage you to let loose. Maybe they think they're classy?  In any case, I had the blonde hefeweizen and the Grand Cruz, which came in a small goblet and packed a whopping 10% ABV. Not that you would guess that by tasting it! You may want to be picky about the mixed drinks, however, as my mojito was pretty bland.  I'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course, more of their delicious beer. I won't stay too long, however, unless I finally come across something enticing on the list of traditional entrees.",

We had explained to our waitress that we were in no hurry. We sat for a good 20 min talking, with the waitress stopping periodically to see if we were ready to order. We finally ordered and our food came out quickly. Asian chicken salad and bison burger. YUMMO! I enjoyed having a great server who allowed us to pace the meal. She did not hover around rushing us. It was lovely! She got a great tip for her patience with us! My new fav spot!",

It took an hour to be seated, which was 30 minutes passed the suggested wait time. When we were finally seated (party of 5) the booth was filthy and too small. It took 25 minutes for our entire party to get our drinks. After another 30 we got our appetizer which were all salads. It took another 26 minutes for me to get my salad dressing. My husband and I have celiac so BJs is usually very accommodating when it comes to food allergies. When I got my food they had their battered fries touching my gluten free burger, unfortunately with celiac that would have sent me to the hospital. I had to have my food sent back. When i received my burger it was raw in the middle and missing a couple things that came on it. My father in law ordered a burger and fries, the burger came 20 minutes after everyone else finished their meal and his fries were cold.My father in law was also horribly disrespected by one of their managers when he complained about the service. She snatched plates out of his hands rolling her eyes and mumbling. The other manager came out and apologized and took care of the entire bill. We love bjs but will never return to this location ever again.",

It wad a perfect mix of sweet and tart, and you could taste the feint strains of fresh basil in every sip. Then we had the tickled pink, and also a watermelon margarita, again perfect. Our main entrees were the jambalaya, and the fish and chips, the fish was perfectly battered, and tasty, the jambalaya was super delish with fresh roasted tomato, and fantastic seasoning. Overall a perfect dinner, one of the best I ever had.",

The manager offered a salad or soup while I waited for my replacement sandwich to be made which I did not want. This was the only accommodation offered. The replacement sandwich took forever to receive which resulted in me pretty much eating by myself since everyone else's food was gone by then. On my last bite of sandwich, I saw a small piece of food that I did not recognize but went ahead and ate the bite. I am certain it was a small piece of bacon fat. In addition to this, I ordered a beverage and had to flag down the waiter to get it because he had forgotten. This level of service is totally unacceptable.",

I picked it because it looked like it had a few items my picky husband and 6 year old would like. There was a small crowd waiting to be seated when we arrived. The hostess told us the waiting period would be around 35 minutes- not too bad. We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to finally be seated. It seemed like everyone who arrived after us was being seated before us. And from what I saw, most of them seemed to know what to expect from this place. Everyone and their grandma had reservations that night! When we finally did get a table, my husband and I placed an order right away (we had plenty time to memorize the menu during our long wait). Our dinner did not arrive until about 50 minutes later.  My husband ordered a burger and fries. Son ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Both thought the food was decent, nothing to rave about. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and sausage, Jambalaya. It tasted like one of those frozen meals that come in a bag and you can just reheat in a skillet.  Idk what seasoning were in it, but it was definitely overpowering.   I will say that the waitress was attentive and apologetic for the very long wait. She's the only reason I bumped it to 2 stars. She offered us a free salted caramel pazooki (?) I'm so glad I didn't pay for it because it was overly sweet and the cookie was hard as a rock. What a bust! What would have been a little over an hour experience turned out to be around 3 hours long! As a result, we didn't have time to make it to the Star Wars movie we'd planned for after dinner, so we headed back home. We all agreed we'd be crazy to come to this restaurant again.",

My favorite - Balsamic chicken with white cheddar cheese mashed potatoes use to be incredible all of the time. I'd always get this dish whenever I'd visit.... I've been gone for a while and upon return have been let down. My husband got a dish he hasn't had before and said it was okay, and the avocado egg rolls for appetizers are no where near the cheese cake factories avocado egg rolls (which are amazing). The food was served luke warm as if it had been been sitting for a while before getting served and quickly went cold. The server was only extremely \"on\" and attentive, or \"off\" no-where to be found.  The prices sure stayed the same - around $70 for 2 people but the quality of food isn't what it used to be sadly. The only thing that was on point was the strawberry Mojito.",

I had the ahi salad and substited poke.  There was a really strong dressing that made it  inedible.  2 of my dining companions also had salads, which were prononounced \"adequate\".  Our other dining companion had pasta, which she liked.  Ultimately, the experience was not horrible but was not exemplary either.

I organized a Bachelorette Party and called a ton of places trying to find somewhere we could go without having to rent a party room, require a minimum purchase per attendee, allow separate checks, etc. BJs was the perfect fit. We had a party of 20 and they were smart to assign two waiters to us. This was a huge help! They even allowed us to decorate the table and bring in a cake. The waiters could not have been more polite or provided better service. It was a very busy night for them, but you couldn't tell. The entire staff was so courteous that it was a wonderful experience for everyone there. Other attendees even mentioned how great the restaurant was throughout the night.   I HIGHLY recommend this place for small or large functions. They don't make you feel like you're a burden having so many people. The even did separate checks for each girl there and they didn't add gratuity. This was very smart because me and some of the other bridesmaids tipped over 50% because we were so happy with our experience.",

I went with the California Chicken Club half sandwich with fries and the broccoli cheese soup. The sandwich was a little on the greasy side, but good. The fries were delicious and totally bad for me, but I loved them. The soup was honestly not very good. It came out cold (not what it was supposed to be) and I ended up having to spit some out because there was raw/rough broccoli stems in it. Plus the raw herbs on top really did nothing to the flavor. Might look nice but flavor wise it clashed with the soup. I will probably be back since this is one of my employees favorite places but I won't get the soup again and would probably modify the sandwich to avoid the grease. The server Kayla was great and that is the whole reason for not giving a lower rating.",

I got one of there signature beers and a $6 burger and fries. Very good. Burger was a little greasy so make sure you get it well done. We all got medium well. Still greasy. Go for the well.  Our server, a young Hispanic guy, was very good. I think he had his family in to eat because everybody was hugging him. It was really sweet. He had a big smile on his face the whole time.

The last three times I have come to patronize their facility I have had to wait for a table. We waited even though many tables are open. The only reason why we are waiting is because the management has no clue on how to staff the facility. I was in the restaurant business for 30 years and know the biggest pet peeve is waiting to be seated. This maybe my be our last visit.",

    "text": "Big place with only a few locations in the Valley. It's crowded and loud for a Monday night but their rewards app allows you to reserve ahead to shorten your wait time. Worth it if you are in the area and plan to visit more than once. The app also offers neat features such as point tracking, mobile bill pay and order ahead.   As with any large space, it was loud and vibrant. The bar was huge, with TV screens viewable from the dining room. The food was good. We started with the queso dip, topped with green hatch chiles. Everything seems to have a skew towards spice. Very good flavors and a large menu.  I opted for the Ahi tuna salad. My husband had a chicken salad. The tuna was perfect but I wouldn't order the salad again. It was too vinegar-y. Perhaps ask for the dressing on the side next time or for an alternative.   Our large party was handled nicely by one waiter. They have order pads to keep everyone straight for their separate checks. The only downside was the lack of clearing the table. Nothing was moved off until dessert.   The desserts they are known for are the pizookies - cookies topped with ice cream. I have to say, those are pretty good. Definitely shareable. The other end of our table ordered a pizookie flight - came with three smaller  cookies with different ice creams. Something special for sure.   Monday night specials are $5 margaritas and 1/2 off pizza.   Great for groups and large parties. Not good for a quiet night out. Skip the fish, we could smell a woman's order of fried fish, at the next table. It shouldn't have smelled like that.",

I have had Chicago pizza in the heart of Chi-town, and had NY style pizza in NY. This particular pizza is my absolute favorite. The garlic bread style crust is not too hard or too doughy.

I usually love this places food but I'm just about done. $4.99 to deliver a kids chicken strip meal, adult chicken strip meal. I ask for 2 extra honey mustard. I get nothing at all. I got 2 strips for my meal and 2 little ones for my grandson and the fries are actually cold. My tea is water with an orange in it and my grandsons apple juice is water. How hard is it to get an order right? I think paying $27 bucks for not even close to what I ordered is ridiculous.   Update  03/31/19:  So my daughter is over at my house with my grandchildren and she decides to order from here. Apparently they have my address on a wall there somewhere with a note under it that says \" if someone from this address orders the mandarin green tea, don't take it to her\". This time, they brought the kids drinks, my daughters and boyfriends drink but don't even bother to bring mine. I'm so done with this   Update 05/13/19:  So I have been on a Keto diet for the last week and lost 10 pounds. I ended up with a bad case of the stomach flu and today I was felling better to get food so in my absolute stupidity, I ordered from this place again . I haven't eaten in days and was looking forward to simple chicken strips and honey mustard dipping sauce. I am allergic to ranch. I was extremely explicit that I did not want ranch I wanted lots of honey mustard. I don't like eating the chicken without the dipping sauce. What a surprise when I open the food and I get 4 ranch. WTH. Why is this so hard. Why can't your people get their act together. I have now wasted $20 as I'm not eating the very cold chicken that I got without the sauce. I get it . They don't want me to eat here. I will make sure that anyone that asks gets told of the experiences I have had here and hopefully they don't go there because obviously they don't give a crap about their customers. If I could give minus 10 stars I would.",

I finally went in with our Sunday dinner group and let me tell you it was well worth the wait.  We did have to wait they quoted 45-60 minutes and at first I thought no way.  However as we talked the time went pretty quickly and we were seated in a mount 47 minutes. The food was simply amazing.  Our experience was so great that we actually went there the next Sunday as well and again our meals were fantastic. The variety of non alcoholic beverages were an added bonus. I particularly enjoyed the orange cream soda. We had a variety of appetizers all superb and lot course the dessert was delicious.  I wish I could give more than 5 stars.",

The first issue was that one of the pizza's had NO sauce on it. You can see they put a tiny bit on there but I asked for extra sauce and it was bare. If I had time, I would have had them remake it but since I didn't have an extra 20min to sit there, I just asked for extra sauce on the side so I could make it right myself. Wasn't the same though and didn't taste good. The other pizza did not taste how it normally did- it tasted \"off\" according to my husband. Needless to say, we ended up wasting $30+ that night. We will NOT be wasting money here again.",

The watermelon was chilled and considering we'd just come in out of the heat it was exactly what was needed :)  Oddly enough, we drank coffee :D  In our defense, this was a late brunch for us, so it was almost a must.

    "text": "After Flemings next door decided to close early before their posted hours and one of their employees rudely noticed us through the locked door, turned and walked away, well...  my wife and I were going to head back to Westgate where we normally hang out and celebrate our anniversary at another place known for brewing their own beers.   Being outrageously hungry and bored with their menu, we decided to give BJ's a try, and I'm glad we did.   First of all, the BJ's menu is an employee manual.  Loan document folder.  Car manual.  The thing is huge, and completely disorganized, and flipping through, I became frustrated at the randomness.  I sort of loved and hated it at the same time.  On the other hand, there's something for absolutely everybody in that massive encyclopedia of options, and it's unlikely that even the most ardent of loyal customers will get bored with the selection.  So... +1 on that one, because we'll probably be back a few times.     The deep dish pizza is about the closest thing I've had since leaving southside Chicago quite a number of years ago.  The BJ's special deep dish nailed it!  Deep dish pizza is a favorite of mine.    If that wasn't enough, they had Wyders Pear Cider on tap, which I haven't had since my San Diego days.  It's like my two favorite things in one spot.  We really enjoyed ourselves.   My wife ordered the chocolate chip cookie pan ice cream thing - wow, what a desert.    Two things kept this from being a 5-star.   The \"It's that drink\" drink special tasted awful.  It was like cough syrup, and it doesn't mix.  I expected a lot more, and that drink didn't deliver.  I don't send back drinks as an absolute rule, but I'm confident that if I did at BJ's (unlike some restaurants), my replacement drink would have been treated respectfully.  Still, we just don't send drinks back.  Ever.   The other lost half-star was because the prices were pretty hefty.  We had an appetizer of avocado something-or-others, pizza, dessert and 3 drinks that came up to almost $100 inc tax and tip.   It just seems like a lot of money for a meal.   But we left stuffed, and with leftovers for the next day.     The staff was great.  They really worked together.  Rather than \"this is my section\" type of servers, everyone seemed to genuinely work together and check on the customers.  Having worked as a server for a number of years, this dynamic was both unusual and impressive for a diverse group of people.  Loved watching it.  Loved watching people get along.  Class act!  And everybody, bar none, was professional from the hostess, to the waitress, supervisor, manager and everyone else.     I also notice that management actively reviews and listens to customers.  It shows.  Your staff aims to please, and it shows that you're actively involved.  Nice to see!    We dined on June 26.   Thank you for the great experience!",

I like the location as compared to the other BJ's restaurants. Plenty of things to do in that shopping plaza; movie theater, stores, other bars etc.   Their beers are my main reason for spending my money there, not exactly a brewery but they serve their own craft beers which are excellent for a chain establishment, what always surprises me is all the craft beers from breweries they have on tap. Either way you can't go wrong having a pint or pitcher from there.   Food is definitely unique lots of different pizzas and burgers to choose from, pick one along with a beer and you're good. The staff there is pretty much on top of their game so feel free to ask what would go well with whatever you're drinking.",

    "text": "This was probably the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a long time. My friends and I visited this Bjs to celebrate a birthday and had to wait for a table even though we had made a reservation for which we arrived early. The food came out before the 2 appetizers that we ordered and when the waiter refused to remove them from our bill we had to box them up to take home. They brought out the birthday pazookie for the birthday boy but no one sang for him (even though we watched them do it for 3 other people while we were there). The check had to be fixed because the waitress failed to give us the 50% off on the 2 pizzas we ordered during the monday half off all pizzas. The final insult was that no one said \"bye, thanks for coming\" as we exited. We never made a scene or asked to speak to a manager so this level of treatment was uncalled for.  As an Area Manager, I know the level of impact a simple greet or exit greeting has on customers. Hosts should not be on their phones or gossiping at the podium for customers to see and feel unappreciated.",

    "text": "Super disappointed on my recent visit. I absolutely love BJs and I will continue to eat here. I love their food list, caffeine free teas & homemade beers. But. The last 3/4 visits we tend to get the waiter Ruben. In my opinion, he treats my husband and I like we are teenagers that won't leave a tip.   Just to clarify, I celebrated my 28th birthday here on Thursday & we always tip 18%-20% in this case, he got a little over 18% on a $95 bill. & It was just my husband and I.   Now to roll into the service we got from him. When we asked questions about the menu, he would quickly answer them & move on, not in a conversational way, more like dismissive. He wouldn't make much eye contact and at one point, he completely walked away ((as we were talking to him)) and went to another table. He forgot our refills many times even when he said he'd be back with it. The other servers through out the night that were walking by would refill our drinks or clean our table and chat with us. One lady noticed my husband wrote happy birthday on my To-Go box and asked if I was here to celebrate my day, then she told me happy birthday and that she liked my cardigan. I looked at my husband and said \"I wish she was our waitress\" but nope, back to Ruben. My husband asked about the beer that was displayed on the tables advertisement and he just answered we no longer have that, so my husband asked about the voodoo IPA, again they're out. He even showed us his tablet and says look it tells me 0 that means they don't have it so I can't help with those, anything else you'd would like? ...another dismissive response. Now, it wasn't busy. We sat right away and there was many empty tables surrounding us. Throughout our food waiting progress, he didn't serve any to us. All the expos in the back did.... understandable, yes. But he never checked in about our food, instead it was to ask about our next meal course. Which throughout our visit we ordered drinks, an appetizer, starter salads, our dinner & then dessert. So just keep in mind the service in between. Well as the night went by, a table of 3 adults and 3 children sat next to our booth. & That's when we watched how different his personality was. He was goofing around with the kids, laughing with them and was on top of everything. He passed us by so many times to attend to them. Leaving us there patiently waiting to order or to ask for refills. Well finally he asks us if we want dessert so we asked for a Pizookie because you get a free one on your birthday.  & Then we got our bill. I asked him to add my rewards, he cut me off to say they are already added, before I mention again that it was my birthday but he slid my card and he walked away for the receipt. As I grabbed it, I asked him if it took of my birthday Pizookie and he acted all shocked. Maybe he didn't hear me the 3 times I attempted to say it because he walked away or just interrupted me but he got all upset and said he could take it off but the process would take a while. I told him it's fine, and that I was coming back with my sister next week. He grabbed my phone and told me to show him my rewards page on the app, & said look there is nothing in your rewards tab. I said okay but I tried telling you many times it's my birthday but you talked over me or walked away every time. Then he goes to grab my receipt and said very annoyed I'll just take it off for you. I pulled my hand away and said it's fine, it's just $7, I'll get it again when I come with my sister. And with no surprise he once again walks away!   I don't understand why a two top table would cause him such stress but that's the type of service we get every time he is our waiter. So finally.... Here is my long review not specifically on BJs food but on one of their waiters you should try your best to avoid.",

The HH food, appetizers. burgers, pizza etc. were super. I think just about the entire menu was ordered by the group and everyone was very happy with what was put in front of them. Our server did a great job taking orders and making individual bills for everyone (not the easiest thing to do, matter of fact, a pain in the butt), but it was handled well. BJ's seems to be a great place for a small table for two or a large table for many.  I am a fan and will return.",

Came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends. On your birthday you get a free pizookie. It's a good size u can share with 2-3 people.   I got the broccoli cheese soup. You can get it in a bread bowl but that costs like $3 extra but it's definitely good. You can also ask for crackers on the side. I also got the tri-tip and chicken. It's steak and chicken with your choice of 2 sides, I got mash potatoes and green beans. It was so good! My friends got salads as well and etc.   We ordered a pizookie cause duh it was free lol we chose the white chocolate macadamia with peanut butte. You can do 2 flavors side by side but it tastes like they mix it together but it was good.   Don't forget to download the app to receive points.   Also they have great deals during the week.",

Not bad, not bad at all.  We went with a Large Vegetarian Pizza.  It was legit!  Crust is light and airy, but crispy on the sides/bottom.  Reminded me of old school PIzza Hut pan pizza, but less greasy (which is good!).  It was packed with different veggies and tasted great!  Very filling pizza, too.  We took 3-4 slices home with us for breakfast the next morning.  Service was great!  Our waitress was new (she told us), but was quick on the drink refills and very pleasant and cheery.  If you sign up for their E-Club, you get a free Pazookie AND 5 dollars off a future check, too.  We used the $5.00 off coupon.  Pair that with the 50% off Mondays and we made out like a bandit!  Very reasonably priced, delicious, and fast in and out.  I shall return!",

BJs was draw because the girls and hubby had been talking about their dessert: Pazookies. They had gone to another BJ's when they were on a road trip.  We walked in on a Thursday night. The place was filled but we were fortunate to get a table for five. Service was fast, bringing us menus and water. At our table, we ordered fried zucchini strings that came with ranch and another tangy dipping sauce, but the strings were well seasoned so no dip was necessary. Hubby's barbecue ribs were unremarkable. The string beans looked great but was bland. The loaded potato was good. My other daughter loved her Margherita flatbread with fresh mozzarella and basil. I thought the meatballs and and mashed potatoes were tasty and was something I'd order again. This was on their tapas or small plates menu. My son enjoyed his Tuscan tomato soup in a sourdough bread bowl.  My favorite part of the meal was indeed, the Pazookies. I had the Monkey Bread Pazookie. The perfectly sized dough balls were had ooey-gooey caramelized cinnamon. Hot and served a la mode! Yum! Maybe I will come back just for the Pazookie! Forget the appetizers and main meal. One Monkey Bread Pazookie, please!",

Overall the food was okay. The most stood out ones were Avacado spring roll, fried  and stuffed mushrooms. The Pizza we ordered wasn't deep dish at all. Not at all pie crust and no bursting cheese. Rather the bread was fluffy with light cheese topping. The ribs were okay. It was little dry.   The drinks were good though. The watermelon Mohito was amazingly refreshing.  The service was good. The over all experience is always nice at BJ'S but the food was not so worthy for the price we paid.",

My favorite item was the mozzarella and tomato salad! The dressing they use is delicious and hits the spot before the \"actual\" food came out. My flatbread was underwhelming, but I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, considering a margarita style item is pretty simple. The pazookie was delicious, as usual. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors!   Parking: ample, free parking around the building and near the shopping center",

    "text": "FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD  I have never been to a restaurant that advertises so fraudulently. They advertise Deep Dish Pizza, and state \"We also understand that innovation is at the heart of what makes Chicago-style pizza so beloved\"   These guys have ZERO clue as to what a Chicago deep dish pizza is and  grossly misrepresent a cultural classic. I ordered a \" deep dish\" pizza on Monday which is their 1/2 off pizza day and a 14\" cheese and onion was $15 bucks. As god as my witness if I had spent $30 on this garbage, I would be contacting a lawyer.     The pizza is terrible and in no way, shape or form resembles a Chicago deep dish, other than the fact is was round with red sauce. These guys are from Cali for pete sake, if they sell a kale sammy I am sure they would nail it .  The pizza looked and tasted just like one of the 3 big chain pan pizzas. It is 100% not a deep dish pizza, it is a pan pizza. A deep dish is filled with tons of cheese and topped with red sauce and has a much thinner crust that what BJ's has. BJ's deep dish has the cheese on top of the red sauce, so even fundamentally they are incorrect and False advertising. They are simply selling a pan pizza as a deep dish and I call BS!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry, but if being from Chicago makes me a pizza snob, so be it.  I hate when people use Chicago in there descriptions when they have never been or actually tried a Chicago pizza. Oh I added a picture of what an actual Chicago deep dish looks like. Hmmmmm, doesn't look much like BJ's.   So if you want to spend over $30 bucks on a crappy pizza you can get for $10, knock your socks off.   BJ's you should be ashamed for using such an iconic and beloved name for your circle with sauce.   I have learned my lesson and will stick to the transplanted joints that are actually from Chicago. White castle coming soon baby!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The noise level was good--nice background noise, but not intrusive.  Our server was fabulous. One of our biggest obstacles in dining out as a family is that our son is autistic and can only eat chips in restaurants. I asked our server if it was possible to get some tortilla chips by themselves and she was extremely nice about it. Thank you, thank you. A big tip for that kindness alone.  My husband enjoyed sampling the beers. He had the small deep dish meat pizza and loved it. In the bit I had, I could tell the meat was very fresh, the cheese was real, and the crust was good--thick but not as heavy as some places. That was definitely the only meal my husband had for the day!  I had the seared ahi salad. Oh, that was divine. Colorful with a fantastic mix of textures and tastes. I loved the dabs of wasabi at the corners of my plate. I'm grateful that they had a full menu of \"enlightened\" choices with calories clearly labeled; I wish more places did that. I felt like I got to eat out responsibly and have a fantastic treat, too. (To note: I love the ahi salad down at Yardhouse, too, but the two salads vary widely in ingredients.)  We're already talking about opportunities to make a return visit here for a date lunch.",

I didn't want to run the risk of a crappy meal.  I had the buffalo burger, and while the meat and cook were decent enough - what made this dish so good was the barbecue sauce, pico de gallo, and grilled green chiles that were topping it. Seriously, amazing. The cole slaw that came with it was less than desirable haha, but I still a few days later now cannot get over how good the sauce and condiments for that burger were.   I had the calamari appetizer though, and it was really lack luster. Definitely do not recommend that. It was a good enough for me to be willing to try it again sometime.",

For dessert we ordered their signature freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Total crowd pleaser.    As this restaurant is a brewery I must mention that their selection was vast with great variety. They offer 3 free 1ounce samples which our waitress helped select (but you can choose any on the menu) & the one my dad selected was delicious! He was very happy.

They have a very large drink menu my some really creative drinks, also have a decent happy hour..",

    "text": "It was dinner time and we decided to go to BJ's. I knew since it was 7:00 there would be a wait. We were told it would be 45min. This was fine with us. We were seated in about 30 min. The layout of the restaurant is open but the noise level was not bad. You can easily carry on a conservation at your table. We were seated by a very energetic hostess. I did not get her name but she made you feel like they were glad to see you and service was going to be great. Our waiter was Gabby. She took our drink orders quickly and brought our drinks. I finished my ice tea before our meal was delivered. It was several minuets till this was noticed and was offered a refill. Everyone ordered and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I had ordered the half soup and salad. Not anything complicated. Wedge salad and clam chowder in a sour bread bowel. Others ordered BBQ chicken chopped salad, Angel Hair Toscana, and a Traditional Calzone.  All the food did not arrive at the same time and we had to ask to get the remainder delivered. My clam chowder was very bland and did not have much taste. There was plenty of clam meat but it was hard to tell it was clam chowder by the taste. Definite don't go for the clam chowder. I asked about the calzone and was told it had almost no filling. Very little cheese and was mostly pizza dough. So don't go for the calzone. The others reported their chicken salad and angle hair pasta was very good. We had to wait again for some time to get refills on drinks. Our waiter was not very attentive. Will I go back? I will probably give them another chance. I do know what I will not order next time. I do like the look and feel of the restaurant.",

I was excited about having another brewpub nearby. The second time there was a second bartender. She was in the wrong business. She was not happy to be there and made sure you weren't happy either. No personality, slow and inattentive. I had the pale ale and the IPA with chicken wings. Once again the beer and food were good. The third trip the first bartender was on duty. OK service, nothing to write home about and the red beer was very good.  Up to this point I was looking forward to visiting again. On the final visit the first bartender spilled an entire glass of beer into my and my guest's laps. Accidents happen. I expected that at least the first round of beers would be free for having bathed in beer earlier. When the check came all beers where on the check. I asked about getting the beers taken off and was told no, it would get her in trouble.  I shouldn't have had to ask. When I did something should have been done. I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food. The service I had from the two bartenders is the best reason to not return. Occasional bad service is to be expected but two bad bartenders out of two says management needs to pay closer attention.",

Asked again and were finally given a menu.  We made our choices and waited a long time for each course.  We reminded our server 4 times about our dessert and waited 40 min to finally get it.  The check came and were charged a dollar more for an item the server quoted.  Her answer was \"sorry, I was wrong.\"",

We ordered half pepperoni and half buffalo which is one of my favorites and of course the artichoke and spinach dip.  Our pizza arrive and it was perfectly fine but our server thought it was overcooked and surprised us with a whole new pizza without warning.

    "text": "Hmm. I feel a bit bad giving this a three-star, considering that I haven't tried their pizzas yet. I'll update it later if I come back to try them.  I've been to numerous BJs over the years, and I know how their song and dance go: Order the pizza, order the pizzookie, and you're good to go - everything else varies. Well, I decided to go against that formula and ordered a beef dip. Which was actually surprisingly good, considering that I've ordered the same in a different BJs and it was so-so at best.  So why in the world would I give this 3-stars and not at LEAST a 4-star? Two things: 1) The service was a bit... lacking. They seated us timely, they were /fairly/ friendly to us, and they got our orders correct. But you could tell that they didn't fully care. They were struggling just to keep their smiles on and their heads on straight. It was later at night, with closing hours coming soon, so it's obvious that most servers would be a little bit conked out by then. But still - it's no excuse. And it can affect other things. Such as the fact that they didn't notice that we didn't have utensils until we'd been staring at our plates for a little while. They didn't fully care for us other than for our orders and our general services. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but I do wish they wouldn't stare at us like we're 'just a job' to them. Again, though, it could just have been the time of the day and the events that transpired before we arrived, but still... it's what makes me remove a star. 2) The pizzookie was... okay. That's kinda' an atrocity for a BJs. Pizzookies are supposed to be soft and gooey (though slightly chewy) and absolutely delicious with the ice cream on top. This one kinda' stuck to the pan a bit more than usual... and was a little too thin in some areas... it was a hassle to eat, and not a mouthgasm as I'd expect. You can't make a pizzookie just 'okay', BJs! Other restaurants are starting to copy the pizzookie idea - you can't be skimping out on the quality! -1 star!  Outside of that, everything else was lovely. If you haven't been to a BJs, come here and give it a shot. If you have been to a BJs, I'm sure you know a better one somewhere else. This isn't a bad choice, but it isn't an excellent choice.  Again, though, I'm going to have to update this review if I ever come back and try their pizzas.",

Her name is Crystal, the waitress of your dreams. She was attentive, kind, funny, and knew her stuff. She simply looked around the table once and had an idea of what we may want. She noticed there was a gluten-free menu in front of my sister in law and immediately recommended gluten free treats, drinks and meals. My father in law is Spanish speaking and she was able to take his order and give him suggestions in Espanol. While taking your order, all of her attention is on you and nothing else, maximizing accuracy and ease of communication. After the orders were placed, she repeated all of the orders to each guest with clarity and precision. There was a mix up in the kitchen with our order and she caught it as soon as the order came out, she brought it to us as a complimentary dish to apologize for the mix up and begged our forgiveness for the mistake. Even in the face of adversity Crystal kept her head on a swivel and her eye on the prize. She conducted herself with poise and class. Everything was delicious, the drinks were cold and refreshing, and we had a great time laughing and conversing with not just each other, but with our gracious server, and new friend, Crystal. We will surely stop at this BJ's again on the way back to our beloved San Diego, and if fate will allow it, we will be granted the privilege of being served by Peoria's diamond in the rough; Crystal: The waitress of our dreams.  Ps. Try the Mediterranean Pita wrap...",

Last night we arrived approx 8:00 for dinner. No wait for a high-top table in the bar area but it took a while to for our server to get our initial drink order. She returned, we placed our food order and that's when the wait time got even worse. Our drinks were empty....even our water! She never checked in, kept looking for her and we were about to just leave but we had a hungry little boy who needed his dinner. She finally came to our table with some weird reason why our dinner was delayed, took off real quick and our glasses were still empty. Finally able to get a second round ordered and then our dinner came out. It was hot and delicious....good thing or we would have just left. We were comped on the bill for the delay so the situation was acknowledged. I sure did notice another couple next to us in tables that were seated 30 seconds before us ( I know, I wanted that table but didn't make it in time) were done, served, ate, paid the bill and left before we even had our meal brought to our table.   The food is amazing and delicious and there is a wide selection of beers. I hope that my next visit our server will be a bit more attentive and my glasses don't sit on the table empty",

    "text": "Went here last night for deep dish pizza. My wife, being from Chicago was having withdrawals, so off we went. We really do like this place in general, though the parking can be horrific. We started with the chicken won tons; Thai style and they were wonderful. When our pizza showed up and we began to eat, my wife loos at me and says \"is there any sauce on your pizza\"?\" Nope\", I said and we waited for the waiter to return. He said something to the effect of, well do you want me to have them put more sauce on it or are you going to eat it like it is. I said, well we'd really like another pizza, this time with sauce. The manager comes over a few minutes later and says something about \"miscommunication\", apologizes and asks us if we ordered it without tomatoes. No, just standard sausage pizza we said. Well, she explains, \"our pizzas are lightly sauced\" (apparently before they have fully risen) \"and sometimes it soaks in or the top rubs\" (against what I didn't ever understand) and may have accidently removed some of the sauce\". So we had to sort of pick apart the pizza in front of her, while she gave us that condescending \"not really a smile-smile\" as if we were mentally challenged, to show her that what we got was essentially cheesy garlic bread with sausage. She wouldn't even glance and it...just kept that artificial smile on her face and said \"let me know if there is anything else that I can do\". As opposed to the nothing that you have already done you mean? That was my inner thought, not to worry, I didn't actually say that. SO, by and by our replacement pie comes out and the waiter says\" don't worry, I told the kitchen \"extra sauce\" and watched them make it. Wonderful, now we got a pie that more resembled spaghetti. Just soaked with sauce. At this point we just give up and ask for our check. The waiter then tells us that due to the pizza issue, we would like to buy you desert. No thanks, we said. He brings us our check and announces, I had that pie taken off your tab (we had a couple of beers and an app as well, so  I wasn't paying that much attention to the total), until my wife pointed out that there were two pizza's on the check and that they took one of them off. I don't bother saying anything at this point, as free food was not what we came for, but I will say this. There would have been one heck of a ruckus if they had charged me for two pizzas. Just a crazy, out of body dining experience. Almost as if they were on the other side of the Dome.",

Here is what really made the night...my husband and I split something and it came with fries and he likes thick and I like the shoestring.  So, Lacey took it upon herself to do half and half on our order.  I know, it's not rocket science but the fact that she took an extra step and thought outside the box was awesome!

You can believe I don't decide to spend that kind of money on dinner for four lightly.. and I won't be eating at BJ's again after being treated so badly.

    "text": "#100:  It could be the chocolate mint martini followed by the candy cane martini which was then followed by the pomegranate sunset but I had a great time tonight [as I always do]!  I went with the crew originally to another brewery at Westgate but the ASU game made parking non-existent so off to Park West we go!  BJ's was the natural choice for an evening of drinks, food, and good company.  The wait time at BJ's at 7:30pm on a Saturday was said to be 25-30 minutes but we were seated after 10 minutes.  No complaints here!  At such a big establishment, the atmosphere was of course gorgeous.  Let's talk food!  We had ordered:  Crispy Calamari:  Typical fried squid you can get anywhere.  I personally love the garlic aioli.  Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms:  Delicious, giant, and juicy!  Just like I like my men!  ;D  Just kidding... kinda.  Seriously though, I can eat that lemon pesto by the spoonful.    Two Steak plates [one had lobster too]:  Both steaks were not cooked to medium-rare and the lobster was a bit too salty.  Both steaks were offered to be redone but hey, we're not picky.  We ate that red meat like champs.  And that lobster tail... demolished.  I really liked the mashed potatoes!  The clam chowder accompaniment and the Caesar salad were also yummy --- especially the chowder!  Hawaii Mahi-Mahi:  This was my main dish.  I was completely happy and in love with the juicy mahi-mahi.  The refreshing pineapple fried rice and stir-fry veggies made everything just a touch sweeter.  They had some Sriracha sauce on the side.  Don't be fooled by the fancy description: it's just pure sexy Sriracha.  Cajun Pasta:  It was yummy!  The garlic bread was good. The creamy tomato sauce wasn't too spicy --- something I'm always grateful for.  I think food is meant to be tasted.  I don't need to be licking a chili pepper!    Grilled Chicken Pasta:  Creamy pasta is ALWAYS a good thing.  We got the grilled chicken instead of the blackened chicken and it was perfectly match.  I would've been happy with just a bowl of that rotelle noodles with the cream sauce.    Overall it was a lovely evening and our waiter was very charismatic, charming, and accommodating [one of us HAD to watch the Boise St. game.  x_x].  Cheers, BJ's!  Thanks for the great evening!",

    "text": "Beware those with allergies. My wife and I use to frequent BJ'S, we've never had an issue. However, this location made my wife extremely ill, and it happened at the Cardinal's stadium right before a game. We ordered takeout and noted her extreme allergy to dairy - she even ordered a salad that contained no dairy, yet about half way through the salad she noticed a slice of shredded cheese - and then more. My wife spent the game we were supposed to enjoy violently ill and very far away from home. You have ruined BJ'S for us. I called that day, my wife emailed, we were apologized to and told the staff would be re-education on the severity of allergies and cross contamination. A giftcard was mentioned, but never delivered. It's the principle of the matter, if you don't follow up on what you say, my wife will never be safe to eat at your concept. If you have an allergy STAY AWAY.",

Bbq sauce was good. Nice sweet flavor.   The shoe string fries was delicious as well.   House salad was ok. I'm just not a big fan of spring leaf lettuce.

    "text": "I ordered BJs through DoorDash twice this week. I was absolutely delighted both times. I used to eat at BJs in Southern California (Torrance) and never had a bad meal...had a LOT of meals. But I'm taking the time to write this review because it is HARD to get delivered food tasting good. On Wednesday I ordered Chicken Alfredo and a salad with balsamic vinaigrette. It's hard for a salad to impress me. It was fresh tasting and the dressing excellent. I loved the pasta dish. There was enough food for me to eat the leftovers for another night's dinner. Tonight blew me away. I hate ordering steak as take out, specially the cheaper cuts, but they had a nice, smaller steak, and it came with two sides, so I ordered it Medium Rare (when does any take out meal have the steak come prepared correctly? And when is any of the less premium cuts come tender and tasty?) YUM. The roasted asparagus was crisp and delicious, and again, the salad with the same vinaigrette was good. I texted my husband and said we'd have to find out if there's a BJs near to where we moved in NorCal. Yum, yum, yum. I don't write reviews like this one...but when a \"chain\" can deliver such good quality food that still tastes good delivered, that's a huge feat and they deserve these kudos.",

He chose a burger instead.Since green beans came on the chimichurri chicken plate that I ordered, I had to select something else as well. We ordered chicken tortilla soup. It came cold. It took a while to catch the servers attention but when I did, I sent it back. Before it came back warm, my husband was finished with his soup and our meals arrived. My husband is allergic to onions yet his burger was filled with them forcing him to send it back as well. My chimichurri chicken tasted good but was also on the cold to Luke warm side. My husband's meal was nowhere in sight so I shared my sweet potato fries with him. He pointed out all the oil underneath my sweet potato fries. Finally he got his burger and left my oily fries alone. Hopefully this was just a fluke night and not a Norm.",

    "text": "We at BearBytes were a table of hungry bears looking for a quick bite before a movie at Harkins. A vast and intense menu drew us in with there being something for everyone. On a busy Thursday evening we were seated almost immediately with a short 5-10 min wait. We ordered hefeweizen beers and hand-crafted root beers with ok results. The beer was strong with hops and the root beers were heavy of sugar and syrup in barely cold mugs. The house salad was very colorful and quite delectable if it wasn't for the tart ranch that smothered it. We were sold on the \"Thursday Special\" and also ordered soups to try something different as well. The Special unfortunately was not as good as we hoped - the ribs were slightly overcooked, the green beans were soaked in a vinegar/sweet reduction that was too overpowering, and the broccoli was super crunchy and not even seasoned (not even with salt). The soup had a better rating with a flavorful taste and well made sourdough bread. The mini chocolate chip pizookie was the best part of the meal with a sweet and heavenly scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The service was nice but when it came to getting the check back with our card it took quite a while with us almost missing the start of our movie. Pricing was decent and the atmosphere was fun and open - but the food was not impressive. We do plan on returning to BJ's to try a lunch service but we are hoping for a more savory selection of options and a better preparation of sides.",

He was completely honest with us on the orders and was always super attentive. Now to the food, oh man, it was great! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs the first time and I honestly thought the portion would be small considering it is small in some other places, but you really get enough for what you spend. My boyfriend got the Southern Comfort and now orders it every single time we go. I also tried the chicken alfredo without broccoli and it was delicious! I loved the fact that the chicken was not as dry as some other places. I also tried the boneless buffalo and was not disappointed either.   The pazooki was the greatest part though; if it's your first time and you have a sweet tooth, you need to try the Pazooki!   If anything, Tuesdays are $3 Pazookis!",

Once our server came over to get our drink order he wasn't very friendly. Seemed very agitated like we are an inconvenience to him. It just went downhill after that. He gave me my drink in a glass that had cracks all over it. He was not very happy when I asked for a replacement. Also my friend had asked about a flavored tea but she wasn't sure she was going to like it. She asked to change it and he didn't seem very happy. He didn't check on us. Others were bringing us our stuff. When my hamburger was served to me I asked for more barbecue sauce and never got it I had to wait for him to come back to the table and for me to ask for it again. I could write a bunch more but I'm going to hold back. Out of all my years going to this restaurant this is been the worst service I received. I ended up not leaving a tip. If anyone from this restaurant chooses to contact me I do have a copy of the receipt.",

The experience was positive, beginning with friendly staff from the host team to our server. Santa Fe Spring Rolls were a tasty appetizer (albeit a tad small). The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was excellent; the small pie is more than enough for one (you can even share a few bites and not leave hungry). My wife ordered the very flavorful toasted chicken pesto sandwich. The Premier Rewards program is a nice plus; simply ask your server for an application before you pay your bill.",

    "text": "This place has everything, and you will not be disappointed....that is, after you finally get to sit down!  Unfortunately for those of us who don't want to wait to be seated, this place has been discovered by many, and there is often a good crowd waiting outside on the weekends. The good news is, it is worth the wait.  I have been to this place several times, as it is close to my home. If you are the indecisive type, the good news is you can close your eyes and point to something on the menu and it WILL be good. Fresh salad greens and tomato/mozzarella salads are a welcome retreat from the romaine fare at other places. The fish and chips here is reminiscent of the traditional Wisconsin fish fry I sometimes miss. The burgers are great, the sandwiches never disappoint. A full bar with a great beer selection will leave you wondering at the end of the night how your bill ended up so high (oops).  Our last visit, we just sat at the bar and munched stuffed mushrooms with a pesto sauce - a steal at $4.50 off the \"small bites\" menu - and thai style wontons dipped in sesame. Supposedly the deep dish pizza is good, but I have yet to try it, since it looks like a meal that would feed four people minimally.  One observation I've made is that this place, being next to Fleming's (a more pricey restaurant), leaves people confused in terms of attire. You'll see people their Friday-night-out attire, but there will also be a family coming straight from a baseball game, the kids still dusty in their little league uniforms. To me, BJ's has a dim, refined, date-night atmosphere that invites couples but is a great meet-up for business associates. Now, I'm a mom, but if you're going to bring the kids, please have them in decent clothes and on their best behavior.  This isn't where you would choose to go for a \"food adventure,\" but it is the place you would take friends with diverse tastes in food and booze, or maybe the in-laws from out of town.",

I ordered the grilled tacos last night and got one with grilled fish and one with grilled shrimp. The shrimp tasted awful. Seemed like they were cooked for 20 minutes too long. A piece of leather probaby would have been easier to chew through. The fish was also very over done but was a little easier to stomach than the shrimp. Our waiter never came back to ask us how the food was, in fact we didn't see him again until he was ready to give us the check. We had waited 30 minutes for our table and I was starving, so I just put on my big girl pants and ate my meal. We will be back because we've also had good experiences here and we do like this place overall, but I think I will skip the grilled tacos next time.",

Once thing I really LOVE about their salads is that they make their own dressings from scratch. I hate places that use dressing from a gallon jug laced with Sodium Benzoate (nothing like that nasty after taste!).

Last night was probably the worst experience we have had at BJ's so far and it left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth.   First off, my husband ordered some pasta with lemon butter sauce, feta, chicken, olive oil, and some other stuff in it. He asked for no tomatoes or red peppers because he is a wuss like that. About 10 minutes after we finally ordered (and I mean finally) the waitress came out and informed him that the kitchen said his meal would be bland without the tomatoes and it would not be the same dish at all, then asked him if he wanted to order something else. After the award winning sales pitch he just received he said of course and asked for a menu. The waitress then disappeared, took another table's drink order, then made her way back with a menu.   Secondly, our waitress was spacey, non existent, and never really checked up on us. Typically I would not be a stickler for something like that but one of the people in our party was given entirely the wrong meal. Somehow fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken turned into grilled chicken pasta with broccoli. The manager came and apologized but that was 15 minutes after the food runner went back into the kitchen to see about the order. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times during this time and never once asked why a large plate of food sat untouched and every person in our table was turning to make eye contact. She never even apologized for the mix up later.   Then they brought my niece's food was brought out about 20 minutes before our food. We were a little concerned when our food did not follow and then about 10 minutes later the waitress came to explain that she sent it out early since \"kids eat slow.\" In reality it just lead to my niece being finished with her food before the adults and had plenty of time to frolic in the left over mac and cheese.   Finally, when the bills were brought out she boasted that she did not charge our table for our non alcoholic beverages (an ice tea and sprite) and acted as if she had done us a favor. I would of much rather preferred that I didn't have to flag her down to ask for a beer (which ended up being watered down) and management would of taken some sort of responsibility for the long wait (35-40 minutes for food- pasta and a burger), poor customer service, and total mess up on an order.",

To start it took us a long while to get greeted, once we were it was by Sarah who seemed alright but way more focused on stocking and getting ready to leave than her tables, tables that were there after us were greeted and served before us, we ordered some drinks I had the watermelon ale which was fantastic, we had a Margherita Flatbread and sliders to start which were also fantastic, but we were abondonded on many ocasions, I've worked in the industry for many years and understand how the system works, maybe sarah was having a rough day, wasn't bad enough to were I'd avoid her section, just hope for a little more attention to detail next time, but we do love this place and the happy hour!! Recommend this location to anyone, I haven't had a meal or drink I haven't liked yet!!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to BJ's and I liked it quite a bit. We went this past weekend for a family member's surprise birthday party. There were 22 of us in our party ranging from 2 years old to 90 years old. It was arranged for us to have our own buffet of food which was great! The service staff was cordial, but I wouldn't call them friendly. We had 2 servers helping us and neither of them cracked a smile...not once. They did provide adequate service for such a large party but to not crack a smile even once is kind of odd.   We had cheese sticks, hot wings, and the artichoke dip with chips for our appetizers. They were set out on a table near us in buffet style. The cheese sticks were crispy on the outside and cheesy goodness on the inside. The artichoke dip was flavorful and the hot wings were actually quite good. The wings were served with NO SAUCE on them and you could add as much or as little wing sauce as you liked to your own taste. This I liked quite a bit. The wings had a nice crisp to them and were plenty meaty. The wing sauce had a good bite to it and I liked being able to control the temperature myself.    For our lunch, we had salad with a choice of viniagrette dressing or ranch dressing. It was a basic garden salad, nothing special, but it was fresh and crisp and looked freshly prepared instead of pre-made as one might expect for a catered lunch. We also had several choices of pizza. My favorite was the barbeque chicken pizza. We also had tomato and cheese, BJ's favorite, and I think it was Mediterranean pizza. The pizzas are Chicago style so expect that thick, fluffy crust. This worked nicely for the selections we had which were loaded with toppings. The crust was able to take all the toppings and not get soggy. There is nothing worse than soggy pizza crust.   All in all, the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I would have given this a 4 star rating had the servers been more personable.  I'll definitely go back again with a group or just with my family and try some other menu selections.",

    "text": "I love the clean, cold modern atmosphere and long booths.  There's a spacious, airy feel.  Beers are above average, with at least one seasonal beer and several guest taps.  The new flatbread pizza appetizers are quite good, and although the pizza isn't a traditional Chicago thick crust, it still makes for a good thick crust pizza.  I like the calzones as well, though $13 for the bigger one is really up there in price considering that is the normal size at other places, and they don't charge $13.  However, they are way overpriced.  $4.75 for a 16 oz. pint of beer is a bit steep, pizzas are at least a dollar or two higher than elsewhere, and even with the lunch specials we find that the tab for two people is always $50-60.  This is for casual pizza/brewpub dining, and we're not drinking a lot.",

    "text": "Sheesh, the last time I went to a BJs, I was screwing around in SoCal ages ago and probably couldn't afford a night of beer & pizza @ BJs on a student budget but went anyway...  Fast forward to today--which means my student budget hasn't really expanded but I still end up tryin out BJs again.  Despite the myriad of beers, I knew what I was gettin--the sampler.  The bartender had memorized the details regarding beers offered in their sampler, which was impressive.  My six beers came with a place mat, describing each beer.  Brewhouse blonde, hefeweizen, porter, a red, a stout, brewnette & an Oktoberfest were my selections.  I know the other beers had more official names but the one I liked best was the one I remember the name to--'Brewhouse blonde'.  It was light & a bit sweet.  (I'm not a beer connoisseur & have been a Miller Lite girl since I started drinkin beer).   Would I recommend you try it?  Sure.  My sentiment on the whole place/experience/atmosphere is exactly as rated 'A-OK'.  Nothing fantabulous, nothing crazy.  Just another chain that is less cheesy.",

We had a Margarete pizza appetizer that was delicious!  We had chicken sliders and beef sliders and they were wonderful!  We had an excellent server, our food came quickly, was hot and really good.  I would very much recomment BJ's and besides, they have Pepsi products - Hurray!!!!",

For what was paid we should have received much better food and service.  I have been to  many of their establishments in AZ and CA where we received much better food and service.  Cheesecake Factory is 10 minutes away and a much better option, one we should have used.",
