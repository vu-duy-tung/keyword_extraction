Nice ambience, and server was super friendly, though maybe kitchen was a lil angry at us because they served a sort of dry steak and their prime rib priztle bun was completely burnt on top .   The fries were good, prime rib is interesting but I could only taste then burnt bitterness so I can't say much :( Still cool looking place , we didn't say anything as coming in late already anyways on Tuesday night so I took off the entire top and bottom off, probably won't be back for food.    Server was attentive , friendly so I'd give 5 star if only on service .",

    "text": "MAKE THE VIG GREAT AGAIN! I live 5 minutes from this location.  I will most likely never return unless it is assured that the staff can produce the good food, service and atmosphere that the Vig is supposed to be known for.  It has greatly declined over the past year. Food is only fair if the kitchen is not busy.  Sitting at the bar assures I will get drinks timely- but again- the food is not good.  Many excuses are made by staff on behalf of the kitchen.   Although business shows up during March- Spring training etc.  slow season is upon us.  The volume of customers won't be there making up for lack of repeat business.   Most important for the management to know is this- there are approximately 3,600 residents of McCormick Ranch that use Nextdoor. (There are over 7,000 residents ) This is a neighborhood on-line communication tool.  Yesterday someone sent a message about never returning to your location. There are an additional 28 replies that concur that they also will never be back.  This is such a shame. It truly comes down to a poorly run kitchen and poor management.     This review is intended to get the attention of the Management / Owners...  I will be happy to share what people are writing.",

The music level was on the louder side but I was still able to carry a conversation with my boyfriend without yelling.   I had the grilled fish tacos (excellent), and the guacamole since we came by after 10 pm. The late night menu is great, plus they had the added bonus of trivial pursuit cards at the tables.",

Tito's vodka and I get to put all my own fixins?  Yes, please.  The only thing missing from the bloody bar were olives.  Must have green olives, preferably stuffed with jalapenos.

We walked in about 6 PM there were a few empty tables but we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes, finally when they sat us I could see those tables were still empty. I believe the manager (he said) a guy with a very swollen bandaged hand complaining about why he was having to work came and helped us get drinks saying that our server was busy,  after waiting a while he came back and said he would take our order. Our server eventually came by said hi and walked away not even noticing our drinks were empty, we asked somebody else for drinks and eventually after our food came we finally got somebody to refill our ice tea. The True disappointment was that shrimp pad Thai my favorite there. It had two pieces of shrimp some noodles and the rest was tofu, way too much tofu, it was like they ran out of shrimp and noodles and just served an order of tofu with a little shrimp and noodles on the side. I was very disappointed as I had been craving my favorite dish for about a week. It was so bad that it's gonna be a while before I even want to order it there again. Come on Vig we really need you in this neighborhood!",

During my first visit, we arrived at the hostess stand and waited to be seated for 10 minutes, while waiters and the girl who appeared to be the hostess made eye contact and just walked by. I walked past the hostess stand, trying to find someone who would seat us, out to the patio, and was ignored, even when I tried to speak to waiters. We left and went to the Arcadia location. We went this weekend, as a second chance and received horrible service. Our waiter made no eye contact, and after taking our order, left to stand at his computer for 25+ minutes. The restaurant wasn't even half-full, yet it took 30+ minutes for us to get our food. Needless to say, we won't be returning to this location because of the poor service we have routinely received.",

The food, the vibe, the adult beverages all top notch as with the other Vig locations.  Personal favorites include (but not limited to) for Brunch:  Hangover Helper (Chilaquiles) amazing with or without a hangover, McCormick Enchildas, and the Monte Cristo.  Five stars also for Bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary Bar.  For lunch a few favorites include the fish tacos, Hot Chick Sandwich, and the Prime Vig Dip.  I wish I could make this a 6 star review regarding the service.  One my last few visits we were lucky enough to taken care of by Seth.  Each time greeted with a genuine smile, attentive service, good suggestions, fun interaction, and just a great overall experience.  Now thanks to Seth we are also proud card carrying members of the Vig Friends with Benefits club.  Oh yes - we will be  back again, and again, and again and of course we will be requesting to be seated in Seth's section.",

Our only bad comment would have been the service. Sat at the bar, bartender seemed more interested in talking to others than making sure we were taken care of. No big deal, probably just the newness of the place and being chatting with new patrons... We were one, not that chatty to us.",

Food is really good, menu somewhat limited but is unique enough to give even a fussy eater like myself many choices. Weekend make ur own bloody rocks. Music is good, vibe is cool. The staff always goes out of their way to take good care of our kids. Family friendly but also great if ur single. Nice size patio, fireplace, misters. Great layout and design. Even when it's packed u don't feel crowded.",

Food and service are good and I was excited to see a Vig in my area but I just don't like being duped into thinking I am at the Vig when I'm not thus the poor rating and me not recommending it to other industry people or people in general..",

    "text": "I was very bummed about my visit today. This review is going to be strictly on the horrible service we received. This was my first time at this location. I took my grandma here for lunch on Saturday. We sat on the patio since it was so nice out.   We seated our self and was greeted by our server Alex. He was very quite and not very personable. Asked us what we wanted to drink. We were fine with water and I asked to put in a order of the hot vings. And thank god I did! Another person brought out the appetizer and they were delicious. But the server never came back out for 30minutes. We didn't even place our order for food yet and we were completely out of water. If it wasn't for the appetizer we would of walked out. All the tables outside were talking  about where the heck the server went and we all needed something. We ended up waving down random employees trying to get some service. A server came out to the table next to us and offered free alcohol drinks for the service but then ran inside without acknowledging any other table outside that were having the same issues. The table next to us even walked out, they either didn't pay or payed the hostess because they never got their bill.   After the 30minutes the server Alex finally came outside and said are you ready to order. Are you kidding! Didn't even apologize or care at all. We ordered food and it was good as always but I'm still shocked at the service today. As expected the server never checked back asking how the food was or if we needed anything. He only came back at the end to give us our bill. Any refills of water we received was from other employees beside or actual server.   I will probably not come back to this location because of this service today. It's a bummer because I really do enjoy their food and was embarrassed I took my grandma here raving about it and it was a huge let down!",

I don't know if it's the location (McCormick Ranch/north Scottsdale) or the fact I came here for dinner (versus Happy Hour or Sunday Funday when I would normally go to The Vig), but this one kind of has a less down to earth vibe bout it. It's fine, but the crowd is definitely reflected in the neighborhood it's located.   We happened to come on a Tuesday, which means TACO TUESDAY. The Vig has a pretty good deal on this day. Five (different) tacos & your choice of a margarita or Dos Equis (I went w/the later) for $15. The tacos were yummy. Honestly, I couldn't distinguish between all five, but like I said they were all great. The short rib & fish were my two favorites. Two of the other people I came with ordered the pad thai, which I tasted and thought was fantastic! It's more a of creamy pad thai compared to other places, but I really liked it.   Service was friendly. We came in with a couple of $10 off coupons with a $30 purchase that weren't supposed to be honored for \"specials\" (as well as HH), and we weren't sure if the \"Taco Tuesday\" was considered a \"special,\" but our waitress has no issue accepting them.   I like The Vig a lot & I'd come back to this location.",

Cheesy tater tots (stuffed with cheddar cheese) served with a jalapeno dip. Flat bread (mushrooms,onions,tomatoes,chives and lots of cheese).You have to ask the server what kind of toppings they have that day.  Mains: Black bean burger (vegetarian burger with with cheddar,tomatoes,aioli,red onions,roasted peppers,arugula).You can choose from a variety of sides like onion rings,fries,green salad,slaw etc.We got the sweet potato fries. Deconstructed Fish tacos (sword fish,pineapple,corn,black beans,guacamole,picco de Gallo,sour cream) with corn tortilla. Pad Thai (egg noodles,tofu,egg,peanuts,sprout,spicy tamarind sauce,lime) you can add chicken or shrimp.  Drinks: Irish Exit (jameson,ginger beer lime,plum bitters). Bunch of Beers.  The food was on point especially the black bean burger, best I have ever had.The selection of cocktails is pretty interesting.Staff is friendly and service is flawless.Overall a fun place to hang.

So at first the prices seemed high then we started ordering and the food came and realized the food was very tasty and not at all overpriced.  10 wings for $11.50 regular price is not bad at all. Very well cooked, with the Thai sweet chili glaze and copious amounts of  slightly thinner than normal ranch dressing that was still very flavorful. A spicy and sweet treat we'd order again.  We wanted to taste several items so we ordered a half size of pozole ($6) and a grilled wedge.  Supposedly for six dollars or half a serving was amazing. Flavorful broth, tender pork, and a crunchy cabbage. For $13 for a very large bowl it seems like a good value for all of the flavor!   My better half had a prime rib sandwich with roasted brussels sprouts. The beef was very tender although the brussels sprouts seemed a little weak in flavor compared to many of the other preparations in the area.   As soon as a chance we will return for actual happy hour offerings.",

I peaked at the taps on my way to the restroom so I knew what to order when she came by. They had Green Flash Soul Style on tap so I was set. I ordered it and she explained to me that it was \"Sour Style.\" I asked, \"Is that a thing? It's not Soul style? Because it looked just like the Soul style logo.\" She echoed that it was, in fact, \"Sour Style.\" I asked, \"So, it's a sour beer?\" And she confirmed that as True so I ordered something different. I later double-checked the bar because maybe it was something new and the logo was just similar. It wasn't. It was the Soul Style IPA as I had thought.   I'm just disappointed that my server didn't check to make sure she wasn't mistaken. Having worked in the industry, I would've been a little more knowledgeable of the beers on tap and if the customer thought something different, I would've taken a second look. I realize Tuesday lunch is probably your C-squad, but still unacceptable.  Also, one of my tacos was really sad. The food prep was rushed so only three of the four were properly dressed and the fish on that fourth one was a third or less the size of the others. It was like that stupidly small Chick-fil-A chicken nugget that you're pissed about counting as a chicken nugget in your 8-pack. Maybe there is only supposed to be three and they just added a half-assed fourth because of an extra small piece of fish? I don't know. Regardless, presentation is important and that was a whiff.  As usual, I hoped for better.",

The sandwich is on the brunch menu along with many other delectable sounding meals like Tres Leches french toast and Eggs Benedict. My dining partners also had Manny's Enchiladas and a Greek Salad but really the Monte Cristo is where it's at.  Our server was Cain and everything was delivered and cleared in a decent amount of time. He told us the banana cream pie was the best dessert. Although I am not the biggest fan of banana cream pies, they put theirs in a mason jar so my curiosity was peaked. It was divine! We had been out in the heat before we arrived so we drank quite a bit of water and they filled our water glasses many times. Four of us ate for just over $60.00 with a drink and a dessert- not bad.",

We ordered the chips and guacamole, the wings, the sliders, and an order of mac and cheese. The food was average, decently priced, the service was slow considering that the business wasn't very busy.  They really need to step up their game, the tourists are leaving and the dry, hot season is coming!",

The crowd there is a little older, perhaps more laid back than the hipsters at the other Vig locations.  Nevertheless, the have a good craft beer selection and a decent Happy Hour menu to satisfy. I went with the fish tacos with were outstanding. Good place to chill.",

I was taken by surprise by that comment. So instead of having the chef cook it properly he asked if I wanted something else. I ordered the pad Thai. Paid extra for shrimp. That was cooked properly and tasty but way too much tofu. My husbands fried chicken Sammy was over cooked and dry but the toppings were good. Will try again and give another try cause it's close to my new home",

I was pretty annoyed that a manager did not stop by to make sure I was ok. I mean isn't that the proper thing to do? I guess I'm lucky I walked out with just a bruised bottom and bruised ego.

The first time was great and the Prime Rib dip is highly recommended.  The second visit was less memorable.  The chicken in both dishes we ordered (Pad Thai and the Chicken Avocado sandwich) were the driest I have ever tasted.  The chicken in both dishes tastes pre-cooked.  Hoping that they will make adjustments in the future - for now, I would steer clear of the dishes.   All in all, a great place that may need to time to work through menu kinks.",

When we arrived, I assume it was close to their hostess being off the clock because she made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience. She was a mixed ethnicity (tanner skin) with long hair, and the only hostess on. She had a huge attitude the entire time we exchanged with her and when we got to the table she sort of tossed the menus down. It only took her 2 seconds to turn around act as though we were paying customers and hop on her phone. It just seemed like a bad first impression. Luckily our set was amazing and the food was great!!!!",

The inside is kinda funky too, not open and a lot of \"hallways\" for tables. The best place to sit is probably at the bar or in that area.  Both times I went there was SLOW service. The first time was their opening weekend, so I didn't think too much of it, but the last time I was there was for Sunday Brunch, later on the afternoon, so it was not super crowded by any means, and the service was just unbearably slow. We kept wondering if she had forgotten about us.  The POSITIVE is that the food is delicious, lots of unique menu items, Bloody Mary bar is supper cool!",

We went on Friday night. We sat inside which was way more enjoyable. The atmosphere itself was extremely different. This time Emily was our server. She was quick, friendly, and attentive. She made recommendations to the menu and offered to split our food in the kitchen for us instead of us having to do it table side. We ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese and the Ribeye. Both of which were delicious! And I have to say, the potatoes that came with the ribeye were the best potatoes I've ever had. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and I just wish there were more of them! Thank you again for giving us a second opportunity to dine at the Vig! We will be back next week!",

They had bar seating and limited menu options. That's fine, but what shocked us was the which music playing. This classy new resturant basically goes to crap after 10:00 obviously. They had non stop rap music playing... I must of heard the N word more in two hours then in my life time. Seriously very disturbing!!!!!! I don't know if if they just screw off at night or change managers or what?",

My wife and I have been to The Vig at other locations but this was our first experience at the Scottsdale location. It lived up to all the expectations we had! What a great place to entertain. I got us started with the nachos as an appetizer and my sister in law said it was the best nachos she has ever had. The chorizo burger was on point, very juicy and cooled to perfection. We took a 6 week old and a 2 year old and they were very accommodating to the family, despite the bar like atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone as a \"go to\" favorite!",

I had the breakfast enchiladas and they were some of the best I've had! My husband had the huevos rancheros, which were just as good. His only two minor complaints ware there are no toothpicks at the bloody mary bar to put his goodies on, so all his accouterments fell to the bottom of the glass. Also, the menus on their website need to be updated. He was looking forward to a corned beef hash listed on the online menu, but it was removed some time ago. Overall great experience and we will be back!",

I don't think it lives up to the others (we always really like the one downtown in the Fillmore area), but we are happy to have it as an option in the area.  It is always packed, so be forewarned if you are going for happy hour- get there early or prepare to stand and wait!  Food is good (not great) and service is hit or miss. It's usually friendly, but often times very slow. Maybe because it's so busy and they are understaffed...   I do love the ambiance of every Vig and this one is no exception. It's a little drafty in the bar area when the weather is cool, but most of the year it's an awesome indoor/outdoor space.",

We were at the Woldmark around the corner, it was 10pm, we were sunburned and set to drive home at 5am the next morning.  So, enter The Vig to save the day.  My husband got the shrimp Pad Thai-it was so delicious the \"I'm not that hungry so just skip me\" (I know him better) hubs only shared one tiny bite and scarfed thevrest-veggies were packed in separate container for freshness (cilantro, peanuts, lime wedges, sprouts, etc).  The pad Thai was still steaming hot, fresh, packed with flavor, perfect portion size.  I didn't get a shrimp which means they were too delicious to share.  My son got the short rib sandwich. Devoured it! No bites for mom. Onion rings were delicious (so I'm told).    I had the bacon/blue burger. Bun and meats were really great but I'd have liked more bleh cheese (it had melted into bun) and some sort of aioli. The braised in wine or balsamic onions were flavorful but not enough to make up for the lack of bleu cheese flavor I was craving.dint get me wrong, it was still great, but I probably would ask for bleu cheese on side for takeout so you could put it on hot burger right before eating.  Side was hard choice-all were tempting.  But I got Mac & cheese which was good.  Phone ordering was a breeze! Never had been there before, found via yelp.  Friendly, accurate, helpful!  Drove the 3 minutes to back of strip mall (not visible from street) and what a cool place.  I found where all the locals hang out! Scottsdale, the area I was in, seemed to close up too early, it was so lovely to hear the music, laughter, chatter of folks enjoying the evening on the front patio.  Next time I'll plan on eating-in.  I planned on having a cold beer while waiting for the food.  It was already ready, but the friendly bartender poured me a delicious and super cold Stella Artois while he rang me up and efficiently processed my payment.  The decor of bar was unexpectedly comfy and inviting, cool, dark, funky, clean, upscale for a suburban sports bar vibe.  Music was great, TVs had sports on, friendly regulars were finishing up and really enjoying themselves.  Tits great to know of this place who is likely one of the only non-fast food restaurants with a late night menus designed to please everyone's craving-from the more expected hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, appetizers, to the various Asian-inspired dishes, etc., all seem to be based on fresh, flavorful comfort food type dishes at a fair price and elevated level of quality.  We ate at a few really yummy places while there so I wasn't expecting to be impressed by anything else, just fed.  It was certainly a nice surprise to be wowed by yet another really great local Phoenix area restaurant.",

I like to go to lunch with my friends, but sometimes I like to go alone, and I can always count on feeling comfortable sitting at the bar. This is always because of Sandy and Tracy, the bartenders that work during the day (sorry, I don't know the other ones, I'm sure they're great as well). It doesn't matter what I order, it's always yummy! Some of my favorite appetizers are the Edamame, the artichoke, kale and roasted jalapeno dip and the calamari. If you like salads, the asian chop or the lean and green steak salad are both equally awesome. Then there are the other dishes, such as the mac and cheese, the fish tacos, and of course the big bowl of posole......Did I mention the awesome bartenders Sandy and Tracy???? Enjoy!!!",

They have a great outdoor space with a canopy over head, and an open path to the inside bar. There weren't many customers at the time I showed up, and my server Cain was always nearby.  I started off my meal with the spinach dip. The chips were house fried and the pita bread was perfect for dipping. My meal was a French dip sandwich and I was surprised at how tender the meat was.   I wanted a fruity mocktail, so I left my decisions up to the bartender. I was given a fruity iced tea from the menu , and I had at least three of them. Delicious.   I look forward to taking my Arizona friends out to the Vig next time I'm in town.",

As gastropubs go, this is definitely not a cut above the rest. Service is spotty and the temperature inside was rather warm.  They do have a bunch of outdoor seating but somewhat limited inside. Also at 5 pm in the evening to not have misters outside is asking a bit much in this area's 100+ temps.  I think I will give it another shot to see if it was just an off day or par for the course.",

They are excellent when it comes to hiring because all the servers, bartenders, hosts/hostesses, food runners, cooks are amazing.  While the Vig has great ambiance it is the staff who make it special.  They truly are what set the Vig apart from other eateries in the area. My wife has bad allergies and the staff go out of their way to make sure she is taken care of.  It is like going to a good friends for dinner.  While it is hard to single out one person I want to mention Macklin.  He really is amazing.  He makes a point of greeting us even if he is running in a 100 directions.  Even when a mistake has been made to an order, Macklin is often the one catches it.  We trust him and enjoy his engaging personality.  He truly is a guy who goes above and beyond what is expected of him.",

Cleaning tables. Making drinks. And still had time to make me my group drinks and talk with us and make sure we were all taken care of. All the service was wonderful.

Great service and an all around fun lunch!

It wasn't as big and open like the one in uptown and the service was not the best. Our server (who I did not get the name) had such an attitude when he approached our table and never smiled once. He would walk away before we were finished with our questions and rolled his eyes. He would disappear for 20+ minutes and eventually we asked another server for help.

We loved their eye for detail with the design of this new building. They offer a large outside patio plus casual elegance inside. The food is consistently good, from well prepared burgers, to elegant entrees. The bar was always busy with both the cocktail crowd to diners eating at the bar. The noise level in the bar side can be LOUD!, especially with all the hard surfaces. It could use some sound deading, and, not great for intimate conversations. The food is the star. Burgers prepared fresh and as ordered. Note to the kitchen, On last visit their regular fries were way too salty with their spice blend. Their salads and sandwiches are excellent. They offer a full bar with a large wine selection. And, remember half-priced wines on Sundays. There is plenty of parking.",

We were greated promptly by Tracy, lovely bartender. Had the Bennett and bubbles that I have wanted to try, it was awesome, not too sweet, refreshing and perfect to pair with my beet and goat cheese salad. Great salad, the mandarin oranges complimented the bitter arugula perfectly. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. He enjoyed both and I tried the mac, it was yummie, pasta cooked just right and thick sauce. The manager was very nice, we chatted about the drinks and their new location in North Scottsdale. We will definitely be back to see Tracy for Saturday brunch. She is wonderful, genuine, fantastic service. She anticipated our possible needs and has a warm smile. Thank you!",

The two together make an awesome duo. We've had them the last 10+ times we have been here and each time they have never been short of excellent.   An added perk of this place is the plugs underneath the bartop. It allows many to work and drink. What could be better?",

Neither of us drink so I can't speak to how good the bar is but the appetizer we chose was the guacamole and salsa which were both amazingly flavorful.  Both were empty by the time the food arrived.  I had the fish tacos and my boss had the spicy maple glazed salmon.  He devoured the salmon and I loved the tacos. I would definitely recommend both.  For dessert we tried what our server (who was also a bartender) suggested which was the banana cream pie in a mason jar and I could not stop eating it.  Delicious and very satisfying. If you're in the mood for a delicious lunch or dinner The Vig is definitely one to frequent.  I will be back to try their other menu offerings.",

Last night, the hostess had her back turned to us before she even dropped the menu on the table.  After five minutes our drink order was finally taken and THIRTY minutes later or food order was taken...and then it came out wrong.   This was a typical night at the Vig.

The outdoor area looked nice, but the wait for a little over twenty minutes so I opted for the bar. I was immediately given a menu by the bartender, who took a few moments to tell me his name and shake my hand. I ordered a 12 oz glass of red wine and the fish tacos. Oh my gosh the tacos were so good! The char on the fish was flavorful, yet not totally burnt tasting. There was an abundance of pico de gallo and salsa verde, and the serving size felt just right. I found this restaurant under Google Map's \"where the locals go filter\" (sorry Yelp, haha), and this was confirmed by all of the folks to my left and right at the bar chatting away on a first name basis with the bartender. I will likely return to the Vig, if not to see if the other entrees hold up to the fish tacos, then to ask about the origin of the name.",

    "text": "Nope. That's all I can rate this place. Nope. We arrived here the other night about 720p. The first thing... a drunken lady standing square in the middle of the entrance to The Vig and a wrapped bottle of unopened wine about to roll off the bench near the entrance. Okay. Odd. The hostess looked at my friend and I strangely for looking at this swaying lady who was not more than 8 feet from her!! No one here at The Vig wanted to help this lady? Grab that wine off the bench, maybe? That looked very, 'low rent'. SO.. in and around her we walked  into The Vig. The hostess barely greeted us, and I will admit we weren't in our normal 'dining out' attire, as we had just left a spinning class from across the way, so I guess I get that we looked maybe a little seedy in our running attire? This hostess never smiled and continued to seat us on the patio without saying a word. That's where we sat.. and waited.. and waited.. ANNNNNDDD.... waited for almost 20 minutes before we finally got the bus boy, who was now to filling our waters a second time, and we asked him for a waiter. The waiter FINALLY arrived and just said, \"You guys know what you want..or you still checking it out?\" There was no apology for the wait or no drink order taken. Nope. Nada. He could have cared less. Was The Vig busy this night? No. NOW.. HAD we not been SO hungry/hangry from our hard workouts, I would have called it right then and there... and left. I have this thing about working hard for my money that I am about to spend on a meal out and I just kind of want a little bit of decent service to go with it. Clearly The Vig McCormick was just gonna fail BIG on that tonight. Not wanting this waiter to leave us again, we ordered diet sodas, lemons for the waters we had filled 3 or 4x now, (those never did arrive), and our entrees. My friends mac and cheese was less than awesome. The cheese was just pasty, for a lack of better descriptives and tasteless. It was an ample bowl and she wanted it to be great! After all.. WE had just burned tons of calories and wanted to eat! She didn't finish even half. I ordered the fish tacos, which I have had several times at The Vig. They were okay. Nothing monumental and nothing horrible. If anything, they could have been warmer. One was ice cold on the fish and I just didn't trust eating it. I did not finish mine either. It's not as though our waiter asked us if all was okay. He didn't. Our diet sodas went empty and we finally just asked the bus girl, (or she could have been another waitress), for the bill, as our waiter just wasn't showing up. We got a container for that less than mac and cheese and he saw we had a promo from the cycling place we had just been to.. NOW suddenly he wanted to chat! How transparent. So I decided at that point.. I won't be showing up here anymore either. The end. What a huge disappointment.",

We've been here a few times with large parties, and the service, food, drinks and atmosphere are terrific.  The place is super cute (really interesting architecture/layout, typical of a Vig), and the patios are really nice.  It's a bit on the loud side, and tends to be busy, so if you're trying to run in and out, it's not your best bet.  But, for a fun night out, it's perfect!  This location is really close to our house, so we pick up veggie burgers, fish tacos, mac n cheese, and various other pescetarian-friendly options on a regular basis.  They really know how to pack em, and they've never messed up an order (I always ask for small modifications, and they always nail it).  The one time it was excessively delayed, they comped half of it and gave a genuine apology - really classy move.",

As we were waiting on our cocktails, we hear the bartenders talking loudly about how they do not know how to make the drinks from their cocktail menu. As we were eating our guac and chips, I got a bite of something hard that was not guacamole- but instead the top of the avocado (see picture). Service was slow and unfriendly, and while the food was good, I will likely not be back to this location. It's disappointing compared to the great service I've received at the downtown location.",

I chose the Ginger Seared Ono dish. OH NO!!!  I can not believe the kitchen would send this dish out to me.  It was the tinest and thinnest fish filet I have ever been served. I could not even cut it as was all dried up and leathery. My boyfriend's fish taco's were sub par to say the least. The tiny pieces of fish in each taco were a joke.  The Manager was pleasant but did not offer to take the Ono off the bill or even offer a drink as I waited for a basic salad. Can't mess that up right!

    "text": "I had tried the Vig in downtown ages ago, the McCormick is just down the street so we decided to walk here and it was awesome.  For an April day it was wildly warm and the misters were cranking thank the lord.    We ordered the Chilliritos for an appetizer...why? WhY WHY...very very very very good.   To drink I was going for something more refreshing and went with the AZ Peach Shandy.  And then came the food, across the table we had the Shrimp Pad Thai, Blackened Fish Tacos, and the Chorizo burger with an egg.  All were delicious, personally my Pad Thai was delicious and my girlfriend's Tacos as well.  Just a fun spot to walk to.  Sort of feel like it is the anchor of the area because it's really not a night life area and is deep in the interior of the strip mall.",

Very friendly, professional and efficient.  Decided on a manhattan as my drink.   The ribs and nachos were out in a flash.   WOW!  The nacho order was huge!   Guacamole on top with a swirl of something white, which I was told was sour cream, plenty of cheese, chicken, jalapenos, tomatoes included.  The ribs were fall-off-the bone great.  It was accompanied by what I believe to be ranch dressing.   The nachos were flavorful with its chicken, cheese, and every third or so bite, the jalapenos with the chopped tomatoes thrown in.  My manhattan was perfect.   I'm glad they put in the dark cherries versus the maraschinos.     I don't know.   Maraschino cherries just don't seem to go with a manhattan.  We ate all of the ribs and probably about a fourth of the nachos.   I thought the chips would be soggy the next day.   Maybe a little, but still somewhat crisp.     I usually go to The Vig on 16 St.   I LOVE their mac and cheese with grilled chicken.   YUMMMM!!  Plenty of cheese.  Yepp.   I'll be back.",

I was assuming since he messed up my order it would be on the house ( and because we paid for nachos already ) nope it wasn't. We also ordered sweet potato fries and he never brought them out.

They had heaters since it got a bit chilly and I assume they have misters for the summer.   To start our table shared the nachos and they were awesome!! I've had lots of wimpy nacho plates at various restaurants but these were absolutely worth it.   They have a decent beer selection, but they also have cold brew coffee which was super smooth if that's your thing. They had some specialty cocktails which also sounded good, I'll have to come back and try a few.   I got the fish tacos, and my friends had the chicken sandwich, the burger, Mac n cheese, and sweet potato fries. The tacos were awesome considering this isn't a Mexican restaurant and the chicken sandwich was also delicious. The burger and Mac and cheese were also solid.   The service was fine, nothing to write home about but pretty standard and timely. Our server was friendly but didn't seem to know much about the menu. No big deal though.   Definitely a cool hang out spot!!! I'll be back.",

The few times we have sat at the bar have also always been amazing great experiences. The bartenders are very personable and clearly know how to make a great drink and make a great drink even better. However there have been a few times we have sat in the servers section later in the night and I am kind of disappointed. The first time we came we asked for our wing sauce on the side, the sauce didn't come on the side, we let our server know but that It was ok maybe he was having an off night. As a server myself I get It. But every time since we have gone always ask for the sauce of the side still never right. The service has been slow and impersonal. Wish I. Could tell you our servers name but he never told us. And if It weren't for the great food from the kitchen and the awesome bartenders we probably wouldn't be back",

I'm just stoked that it finally opened here in the Ranch and that I was finally in town to be able to go, spending a Sunday afternoon there and the place was packed in typical Vig fashion.  We started with our staple of every trip to the Vig: the nachos, eventually moving into the tater tots (of which are now addicting), some wings, and I had the prime Vig dip.    I also like the fact that the new Vig is a brand new building, very clean, and the parking is by far better at the new location than at the other locations being that it's in a shopping center with plenty of spaces available.  I'll have to admit: I'd been driving by once every three weeks or so to see the progress, as I really couldn't wait for the Vig to open so close to my place.  Looking forward to going for happy hour one of these evenings!  So my recommendation: just go and experience the new Vig in McCormick Ranch.  You won't be disappointed in any way.",

My only qualm was the misters were angled down on tables and very powerful, soaking our table, and two members in our party- We asked to move inside, but they ended up turning off the misters-I felt really bad because it affected other people, but I could tell some were relieved as the ladies hair was getting frizzy",

    "text": "I really want to like The Vig business. They always find a way to irritate me when I visit. Came on a slow Wednesday evening about Happy Hour time, the place was pretty slow. I had my small (well behaved) dog with me (on a very short leash).  I walk to a table on the patio in the sunshine while my friend let the hostess know that we were sitting outside. She promptly rushed out at me as if I were trying to steall the patio decor, and told me that dogs were not allowed.  I apologized and turned to leave when the manager came out and directed us to a small table at the very edge of the property. Thanks for letting us stay......... I guess.  We settled in and ordered a bottle of wine (our waitress was no help and knew little about their wine selection). Ordered the humus plate with was also \"Just ok\"  All in all.... I am still not happy with the brand after being to all the locations.   And the humus made me throw up the next morning.......  Thanks for the closure Vig.",

They're house made and perfect.  The Hot Chick - Pretty awesome!  The Vig Dip (sans mayo) - Amazing!!  The Black Bean Burger - Best I've ever had, seriously.  The Carne Asada on Potato Pancake - There really are NO words. I inhaled it and licked my plate. I want more now, so I'll see you soon :)  The french fries and onion rings are great, too! Also, the jalepeno dip you get with the tater tots is out of this world! The manager brought us more and I put that ish all over my carne asada. My husband loved it too.   So that's that. I'm drooling now :)",

The dinner featured 4 beers from local craft brewery Cartel/The Shop that complemented the 4 course meal incredibly well. The most transformative experience was the Biere de Garde - on its own somewhat sour but paired with the sweet pork tenderloin the perfect counterpoint. Loved it all & can only sing the praises of Chef Justin & Cartel Brewery/The Shop!",

The signature cocktail I got was also weaker than when I've gotten it at other locations.

    "text": "The excitement to see a new Vig location THIS close to my house was nearly unbearable for the months of anticipation we had to bear before its opening. An interesting locale amidst a somewhat golf-centric, white-haired community, but I don't care how old you are if you like to party. This location is perhaps my least favorite of all 4 venues, but it is within biking distance and therefore still satisfactory by Vig standards.  The food is delicious and consistent with their other locations. The service at this particular shop is phenomenal. The bartenders are super cool as are the table servers. Service - good or bad - rarely makes or breaks my dining experience, but really good service stands out. The only major drawbacks are: 1) No corn hole/bacci ball....seriously? I didn't know it was possible to build a Vig without a signature bacci court, and I feel personally slighted by this oversight. 2) Acoustics in the bar area are terrible when the house is full. During happy hour on a busy night, it is 100% impossible to have a conversation that doesn't end in a hoarse throat. We've made the mistake (twice) of attempting a drink at 5pm on a Friday - just don't. It's crazy, packed, difficult to order and not worth the screaming match.  I still love you, Vig. And I will still come here lots and lots. Especially for half price bottles of wine on Sunday night!",

    "text": "My most recent visit happened this past weekend and I was extremely disappointed to say the least. My sister flew into town and as indecisive as they may be, I decided \"let's go to the Vig in Scottsdale, I love that place!\" since I used to live in the area and frequented it more often when I did. We were headed up in that direction for a movie so the Vig was a viable option, or so I thought. Out of all their locations and visits combined I have never been treated so poorly! First off, the hostess was unfriendly. She didn't even make eye contact let alone ask how our night was, you know, COMMON pleasantries. She simply asked \"how many?\" and quickly sat us down (it wasn't full in the dining or bar area, btw). My mom and I went to the restroom while my dad and sister sat down. When we came back they already had their drinks, that's fine. I ordered a glass of wine which a man in a button-down shirt served. Maybe he was the manager, but good for him that he actually had a smile on his face and was the only nice person out of the whole staff I had interaction with. There was limited face time with our actual waitress. She finally comes back and gets our appetizer order then she disappears for a loooong ass time! I'm talking at least 15-20 minutes without stopping by to check-in, ask for refills or HELLO! Take our dinner order?? Mind you, there is an elderly white couple sitting next to us where she tended to several times in between her chatting with her coworkers at the terminal in plain view that's ahead of us. At this point I'm irritated as all hell and asked my family if they wanted to leave. A different guy comes and brings our appetizer and as he sits it down I ask him to have our waitress come over. Where is she at this moment? By the terminal, STILL talking to a coworker. I see her look over and start to walk away when we make eye contact. She gestures with her hands that she's bringing plates but the look on my face tells her to come over instead. I asked her if she was going to take our main order (our menus are still on the table) and she responds \"I assumed you wanted your appetizer first\". No shit, but you're supposed to come back to get our dinner order, hence the whole damn reason why we came to the restaurant! She apologizes and says she's taking care of a party. 1. That's not my problem 2. You could have let us know the half dozen times you walked by to see how the old people were doing 3. there is no excuse! It's definitely possible to take both appetizer and dinner order at once and have the food come out in a timely manner like any normal restaurant would. Multi-tasking is part of your job description! I tell her to forget it, we're leaving. She said she could have the manager come over and take care of some things but I refused. I told her I'm not paying for 2 full drinks and an untouched plate of nachos so we walked out to go someplace else. I'm not trying to pull the race card but even when I did live in Scottsdale I can swear I've been treated differently during my dining experiences when I'm with a group of all white friends or a group  who are all mixed races. Customer service is not their forte and it's upsetting that my family and I had a horrible experience here. The other Vig locations are much, much better!",

Since it was a Friday, I expected a wait.  As I looked to my left, there were two empty booths and when I walked in to get a drink, I probably saw three to four empty tables.  I then walked to the hostess and ask can we still there, or anything that is available, she said no, they are reserved.  Anyways, I sat outside and we waited.  We were seated about 25 minutes and noticed the booths were still empty!    The apps were on point and great!  We ordered the Nachos and cheesy tater tots, both were delicious and flavorful.  I was impressed with both.  The entrees, not so much.  I ordered the Vigazz burger with fried egg, medium rare and my girl ordered the black bean burger.  The burger was more on the well side and the egg was done, wasn't even running in the center.  Black burger was plain terrible.  So that pretty much sums up our meal, we took the good and the bad.  Probably would go again just for the nachos though.",

    "text": "A great restaurant with some wonderful style.  I really enjoyed the modern styling and indoor/outdoor flow.  I know it's something that is tough to do in AZ due to the heat in summer, but it was a real treat to find a place that felt so open.  It reminds me of a place you'd find on Melrose Ave. in L.A., or someplace you'd find near the ocean.  There was a warm and friendly buzz about the place and everyone seemed to be enjoying the spaces. I'm a big fan of the style for sure.  The food was good. We were a group of four and had the sliders and wings for happy hour.  The little sliders were tasty but slightly dry. It's tough to make those little buns moist but they had great flavor. The wings were good, without any seeming new twists to the wings I thought they were messy but good. I only had a couple figuring that I'd get it all over myself if I kept eating them.   I had the Pad Thai, which was quite spicy.  I love spicy so it was great for me, but would definitely not recommend it for everyone. The waiter was great and did advise us to make certain we wanted spicy.  The sauce was a little too watery for my preferences, but it was quite tasty.  I am a real Pad Thai fan so I use it as a litmus test for food regularly. I don't think it was quite a Pad Thai but it was tasty.  Many times when you order Pad Thai you do get some chicken and shrimp, but in this case you had to pay extra if you wanted both. It was no big deal and I ordered both. What I tend to like about the dish is that it normally gives you a burst of different flavors depending on what's on your fork. This one was a bit more bold and the flavor was a bit too strong. It's such a dish of variety and everyone has their likes. I just think it was a bit overpowering and lacked delicacy. I think it was more.. Pad Thai-like/inspired.. sorta!  The other dish I tried was the Lean & Green Steak Salad. This dish was very nice. I thought the flat iron steak was perfectly marinated and tender. The greens were fresh and overall it was a real winner.  Once I tasted this I instantly wished that I had listened and ordered it myself.  The steak had a great taste and the salad dressing was a really nice and bold vinaigrette.  I'll definitely be ordering that next time. It's not a large salad but had some really beautiful pieces of steak on top that were cooked perfectly. Kudos on the Flat Iron steak for sure.  We had drinks and dinner outside on the patio. The overall experience was really quite nice.  I did have to keep asking for a refill of water since nobody came around filling glasses.  Everyone was nice enough and we had a great time talking with friends. We never felt rushed to leave which was quite nice. Trying to be fair I enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant a LOT.  I will definitely be giving this another try. The friends I was with had been there before and I was happy to join them and will be again. The overall experience was very pleasant and with some better service and a different dish.. I may be giving this an exuberant four stars .. maybe more. Definitely worth a try with friends and good conversation.",

The snotty hostesses-which by now after 4 tries believe they take a course in this behavior- were indifferent, and were more interested in talking about their own lives them tending to those waiting!   So each time I dutifully waited to get two seats for me and my friend whiles others would come in after me and cut in -disregarding the fact that I'd been waiting - so I quietly would ask the host if they could politely say something but each time they just told at me there was nothing they could do! Are you kidding me? I'm waiting 10, 15, 20 minutes and rather than confront or police the situation myself I thought the hosts would help but it seems they relished the fact that I was in this predicament !  So NEVER again! Besides the menu, crowd, staff and location aren't all that . Not worth the time or effort !! Too many great places one can go around town!!!",

    "text": "I met some friends here on Saturday night, May 19th at 5pm.  I wasn't sure if my party had arrived yet, so I went to the bar to order a drink.  There was only one bartender, and I have to say I was disappointed that I was a ghost to him.  He was engrossed in a conversation with someone sitting at the bar, (perhaps a friend)? I'm okay with that, what I am not okay with is that he didn't acknowledge me.  He wasn't taking an order, he was shooting the breeze, (FOR A LONG TIME). It was almost insulting.  I not only felt ignored, but also intimidated.  (This was a big, scruffy looking guy). I didn't want to yell out and get his attention, (but I know he saw me).  He never did come over to me, finally, after maybe 10 minutes of me sitting there looking like an idiot, a nice blonde lady came out from the back and asked me what I wanted.  (WOW, that was nice).  I did finally meet my party on the patio.  We ordered food, which was very good.  I had the \"Vig burger\", which was really tasty, and we ordered the \"flat bread\" appetizer, which was great.  Once we were seated on the patio, the service was wonderful.  A nice gentleman came out to ask how everything was after we finished eating, etc.  (That was nice, I am assuming he was the manager).  The bartender that ignored me was later on the patio with a motorcycle helmet.  Perhaps the manager can address him on ignoring people at the bar.  (The first rule in the service industry is to acknowledge a customer, even if you can't get to them right away).  This is a signature rule, if he had just acknowledged me, it would have been okay), it will also help you get tips.  This guy grossly ignored me.  This makes me not want to come back!  Other than that, the food was good.  My meal was good, however, I won't come back here on the weekend, unless the manager wants to allow happy hour prices and address his bartenders on proper bar etiquette if they are serving customers.  Paying $4 for a domestic light beer is too much.  I understand it's McCormick Ranch, however, there are several bars in the area that will not charge that much for beer.  (Even on the weekend).  I wouldn't mind so much if the bartenders get properly trained.  I may come back in that case on a Saturday night.",

I used to live downtown and went to the Vig all of the time. Their food is creative and delicious, and the atmosphere is fun! I went to the McCormick location for the first time last night and got my favorite dish: the deconstructed fish tacos...they hit the spot as always! Their wine selection is great, and my friend had a mixed drink that was very tasty! We sat at the bar, as there was a pretty long wait on a Friday night. Both bartenders we interacted wtih went out of their way to be friendly and attentive. My husband and I are headed back this morning for Saturday brunch :)   FYI - the angry review below is likely representative of the sour grapes crew who didn't want a hip restaurant moving into McCormick Ranch. My friends and I are SO excited and are willing to spin those big arrow signs on the side of Hayden to make sure the Vig is a success at this location!!",

Both were cold and delicious, although the Bloody was pretty basic for the price of $9. (I don't need a meal with my Bloody, but I would like a pickle or even better... a stalk of celery in addition to the two small olives.)  The meals we ordered were the Blackened Fish Tacos ($14), and Steak and Sprouts ($21.) Both meals were delicious. The portion on the tacos was good (four street size tacos), but my mate thought the portion on the Steak and Sprouts was a bit light given the $21 price tag. He said he would have been disappointed if it wasn't so delicious. The bill with tip came to over $65 for lunch for two.   The environment in the restaurant seating was cozy and clean. We sat at a booth in the bar where we could view a game during lunch. There was a beautiful outdoor patio seating area as well. The ladies room was a bit dark, and looked a bit grimy.",

Last time I was there I split a Greek Salad and hummus plate with my lunch companion. We both commented to each other that the lettuce in the greek was actually iceburg and not romaine. (that recall has long been past).  This trip today was a to go order called in. I went a little different this time and ordered the Avocado Cobb, added chicken (addl $3) and wanted a couple wedges of their really good pita bread (addl $1 but whatever!). Got back to work and as i'm mixing the dressing and weeding out the crappy scraps of ICEBURG LETTUCE that should have been done by the kitchen staff for quality control, when CLEARLY the menu states ROMAINE lettuce (didn't get that AGAIN). I'm irritated at myself for going there again. All in all......$19 ICEBURG salad. Sad..........  The dressing was nice and light but overall, not happy AT ALL for paying $19 for iceburg lettuce salad. That twerks my hide!",

For example, this evening our steak salad came without the steak. In the past, we've blamed it on whatever delivery service we've used, however, tonight we ordered straight from the restaurant to pick up ourselves, and the order was still screwed up. The food is really delicious and they have a wide variety of options -- which, I guess is why my folks keep ordering again. We're always happy when we dine in but there's some disconnect happening with take out orders. The manager tonight was very apologetic and offered a refund. Try The Vig for a sit down meal, but I can't recommend their curb service! Vibe is nice, casual, and contemporary. I can't give them a scathing review, even after eating a steak-less steak salad.",

On this trip which happened to be on St. Patrick's Day, we rode our bikes with another couple and thought we would stop and eat some lunch and have a drink.  The hostess was incredible when we asked to sit at a table where we could see our bikes which weren't locked up.   I wish I would have remembered her name but she had dark hair and a super personality and is worthy of praise.  We asked to sit at a large couch area to the left of the front door where nobody was sitting and we were told that area was a \"waiting area\" for people waiting to be sat.  It was 1pm on a Sunday and there was a line and the place was half full so that confused me.  I was disappointed that they wouldn't at least allow us to sit in that area and have some drinks.  The server was good but it seemed like the drinks and food took longer than it should have to be delivered to us.  That issue on not allowing us to have drinks in an empty couch area prompted me to lower my rating.  The longer wait time for our food and drinks also had an impact on the rating.  We will continue to go here because the food really is delicious.  They just need to work on the sense of urgency to get food and drinks to customers more quickly and also think about allowing a group to sit wherever they want (to a degree) especially if they are going to be spending money on food and drinks.",

They changed the onion ring recipe, which I used to crave, now it's mediocre. The sandwiches are still really good though, like the buttermilk chicken or turkey. I tried the short rib tacos and was extremely disappointed. It's chunks of short rib thrown on a taco, very hard to bite/eat. The service was horrendous. I had the same server twice in a row and she was awful, never checked in on us or let us order more drinks. If the place is so busy, hire more people who can handle it. The vibe/bar area is still chill so I might be back, but not as much as I was a few years ago.",

Despite it already seeming pretty busy we were seated right away on the patio. It was a very windy evening but the architecture blocked out heavy gusts.  Our server, Amanda, was very prompt and helpful. We started with the Trifecta (sliders and fries) which came with a very tasty mustard/cheese type dip. For dinner we had the pad thai with chicken and big bowl of pizole. They are not kidding when they say big bowl! We also had a basic  moscow mule and coug cup for drinks, both of which were made very well. It was a pretty dark restaurant but the lighting did not detract from our experience.  Given the great service, good food, and nice atmosphere, we will certainly go back.  Also, there was an adorable kitty cat that seems to have taken up residence at the restaurant. We certainly support this!",

We don't generally wait that long for a table so we went elsewhere. Three stars for ambience. Zero stars because we weren't able to dine.",

    "text": "I would avoid The Vig at McCormick Ranch if you want a friendly atmosphere for your friends and small pet.   Beware, they are NOT pet friendly, even with their large patios and near the McCormick Ranch walking trails and parks.   Don't think that you will take a leisurely walk from your home with your loved ones and pet, through the parks and be greeted at The Vig with open arms, you won't be!  We took our 86 year old neighbor there for her finally lunch in the neighborhood because she was leaving her home of 35 years in the neighborhood.  After the movers were gone, we decided to rest and relax on the patio (because it was the first pretty day of cool weather and it was raining).  Our neighbor brought her 10lb minature poodle who lays down at her feet on the patio and ordered our meal.  We were instructed that the dog couldn't be under the cover of the patio and we had to sit further out getting wet from the rain.    The manager came out and said he would allow us to have the dog on the patio this time only, but not in the future.   Pets aren't allowed.     My wife and I eat out about 3-4 times per week.   We have decided that The Vig is not aligned with how people should be treated and doesn't want to embrace the community that they have built the bar in.   When they tell an 86 year old women who is sad for leaving her home of 35 years that her companion and friend can't even be on the patio, something is REALLY wrong with this business and its management.     The time before we went to the The Vig, we walked in hungry and had to put our name it at the hostess desk.   She said it would be 10-15 minutes to get seated.   We looked around and tables were open in the Bar and main restaurant, but she refused to sit us because the \"Counter\" on her iPad that took the reservation had not told her to seat us.  This is Customer Service!!!   I know that it doesn't bother The Vig, but we will never visit this restaurant again.",

Imagine my surprise when this Wednesday I showed up and they had a new menu sans lamb belly salad. Odd.  I mentioned it to the bartender, and she said the chef took it off the menu because they kept running out of lamb belly.  Now, I suppose I don't have the best business acumen, but isn't it better, from a margin perspective, to always run out of something, than to consistently have leftovers? Isn't that an indication that the lamb belly salad is really popular? Isn't that how you achieve maximal utilization?  I mean, I don't know what it takes to run a restaurant, but I do know this - without the lamb belly salad, the Vig is dead to me.",

The brussel sprouts has great flavor on the charred spots, but they were under cooked and still bitter.  The Best turkey sandwich was just ok, the pretzel bun took away from the rest of the flavors in the sandwich. The cranberry chutney was good, and would have enjoyed more of it.   Trifecta sliders were good, just a bit greaser than expected.   Went there for a late lunch on Saturday, wasn't that busy. Service was good.",

    "text": "This was a great catch. Or so I thought. I want to raise the bar on the stars I gave, so I'm definitely going to be back. Why not give the stars now? Well, first off, it took awhile for anyone to come and bring us waters and menus. I finally had to fetch someone. And... well I'll tell you, I'm unsure if I'm glad I did.   I think the most amazing part about this restaurant is the outside seating. There is a wonderful patio in the front, and a more wonderful patio off to the side it has a fireplace. The side patio is more enclosed and private; I imagine for large group gatherings.   Service picked up after we ordered. I had a poke bowl and my other half had the harvest salad. We shared an appetizer of brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were the best I think I've ever had. They were crunchy and crispy and tasty all-around.   My poke bowl, in my opinion, Was lacking quite a few items that were mentioned on the menu. It quoted the bow came with snow peas; I found one that was sliced into thin strips. It quoted that it came with ginger dressing. But the ginger dressing was lacking that punch of ginger -- that pungent strong flavor -- All I could detect was oil and vinegar. But it was fresh, I just felt way overpriced for what they put in it. Unfortunately, my partners salad was about the same. Her salad quoted that it came with cauliflower and other wonderful harvest vegetables. Like me, for cauliflower she found three tiny little flowerettes that were about the size of the tip of my pinky. This was True for all the extra ingredients. She had to hunt to find them. But there was plenty of garden greens.   Well we still would give it another go, as I saw the manager on my way out and he was more than pleasant.",

So we chose to split the \"chef's board\" - ugh!! To bring the disappointment to its apex, they charged $1.00 for more bread! I have no words. We are saddened that we'll probably not be back!

For those of you who are like me, on a low salt diet - the charcuterie board is not a safe choice. However I ordered it because I split it with my friend and I was considerably low on my salt/fluid index that day. I didn't eat the edamame just because I figured if I'm going to splurge on salt I should only splurge on one item. The steak and the fries I was able To ask for no salt and the staff was very accommodating to that! I got the demi on the side so I only used my fork to get a small flavor without all the salt. Their demi is wonderful!   I can't have caffeine so I was beyond excited when they went to look at their root beer just for me and told me it was caffeine free! They had an amazing brand which I believe is called Stewart's.   Unfortunately there was one or two negatives. One, my friends steak dish was undercooked. The inside looked more purple than it did pink. She didn't send it back though, she is shy that way. The only other negative is that if you park in the back, you have no idea where to go to get into the restaurant. (Their outdoor patio is beautiful though!!) we went in through an open door that we weren't sure if it was for staff only. From the way we came in there wasn't a hostess stand either so we felt a little awkward at first - like we came in the wrong way but we were just following MapQuest!   All in all it was an amazing meal for me and the staff was very accommodating to my health needs. I'd love to come back and sit outside on their patio, looked amazing!",

We choose the Vig for dinner strictly based on the fact that we could walk there from our resort, and the night was beautiful!  We had a small wait for a table outside on the patio, but boy was it worth it!    The food was incredible!  Might be the best, Veggie Burger I have had in years!  I had to make a few substitutions to make it Vegan, but the waitress had no problems with making my request happen!  Seriously this is a Veggie Burger, big, bold tasting, and left me feeling energized and ready to rock the rest of my night!    The staff was super nice, the setting is beautiful, and the price was right!  Great spot! If I lived in Scottsdale, this would be a regular stop for me!",

Our server took 13 min to take our order and then never checked back until he asked me if I needed a box. Thing is my sandwich was incorrect, so I was waiting to let him know.  I still ate some of it but then decided to leave rather than wait for another 25 min.   Food was okay, not better than the cool brunch spots down the road in old town Scottsdale.  I wouldn't come back,  but if you end up here, bring a friend you don't mind talking to cause you'll be waiting.",

Waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order and finally we were able to find someone to flag down. When we were waiting for service , a couple across from us were seated and a waitress came in 5 minutes.   Their food arrived in 15 minutes and we still were waiting for ours.  We requested a manager when we saw this and she said sorry and we will take care of you.  Another manage came to our table and said the same. We only ordered food and by taking care of us meant only $1.80 taken off from each bill. .  The tip to the waiter was $2.40. He was nice and came to our rescue.  They ended up losing customers so I really want to give the Vig 0 stars.",

I usually have to hit dives in phoenix to find food this authentic plus no necitas hablar Espanol! The posole is seasoned very well. It has a little spice to it but not so much that you would have to pass it you cant handle heat.  The hangover helper also is a dish that is very tasty and a little spicy. It is almost like a tamale pie with eggs on top. A great dish for the morning after a night of drinking. The spice helps you sweat out late night alcohol. Visited two different times and both times the dishes were the same awesome meals.  Cant speak of the other dishes cause I only go for the Mexican stuff",

    "text": "Even though this is my first review of The Vig McCormick, I have been there for lunch, dinner, and happy hour on four different occasions over the past three years.  This particular visit was for happy hour on a cold, rainy weekday.  The experience couldn't have been better.  For starters, there are modest deals on draft beers and excellent deals on the happy hour eats.  We had the edamame plus guacamole and salsa with chips.  Our waitress, Kelsee, was nothing short of amazing.  She was personable, efficient, competent, and incredibly helpful.  The edamame was a large serving - probably about the same size as the frozen bags you find in the stores to prepare at home.  We had them with salt only, but Kelsee also brought us a side of the garlic soy sauce on the side so we could dip them.  They were delicious.  The guacamole was the best I have ever had in a restaurant (mine at home is just slightly better).  It was seasoned perfectly, and the texture was beyond compare.  The salsa was wonderful, and the chips were fresh, large and crisp.  On your first trip in, be sure to log in to their Wi-Fi (even though it is open - so don't log in to anything requiring you to enter a password).  After logging in and providing your email address, you will almost immediately receive an email with a \"coupon\" for $5 off that first bill.  Great deal.  The prices on the happy hour food are really excellent.  Edamame was $4, Guac and chips $6, and we added the salsa for another $2.  Can't beat that with a stick.",

Or when you notice that person you really wanted to text with read your message, but has yet to respond? Or where Special K is the last choice left in the mini cereal variety pack? Well, I was having one of those days. That is, until I met Jenn (with two n's). We found her service and attention to detail to be impeccable. She anticipated our needs, and it seems like each time we wanted something it was as if she had already anticipated that need, and was right there to accommodate us. We only ordered simple drinks: Tito's and tonic and a draft beer--drinks that any robot could make anywhere and not screw them up--but it is because of Jenn that we will frequent The Vig and continue to pay for drinks we could easily make at home. With Jenn, every mini cereal box is Frosted Flakes.   Oh, and the guacamole was just okay.   Long live Jenn (with two n's)",

    "text": "Another great installation from the Vig people!  This one feels a bit more cozy and intimate than the original in Arcadia, less hipster than the Fillmore, and just a bit less neighborhood than the Uptown spot ... but its still the Vig!  My guy and I went in around 7pm on a Sunday recently.  There was no wait and probably more than half the place was empty.  We were seated promptly in one of the BIG booths inside the bar area, which was perfect for us.  Those booths could easily hold 6 people, so we were swimming in arm room.  ;)  The sever mentioned right away that Sundays were half off wine by the bottle, so that settled WHAT we'd be drinking, but started a discussion on WHICH we'd be drinking.  They have a good wine list with quite a few options, and we settled on a Zinfandel that was really nice (especially for under $20 a bottle).  For food, we decided to start with the hummus duo appetizer.  It came out really quickly and the breads, veggies and both flavors of hummus were on point. We then moved on to entrees.  I got a salad that had grilled shrimp, fingerling potatoes, kale, celery leaves, radishes and a vinaigrette (gluten-free and vegan)... It was delicious!  My guy had the short rib tacos (3 to a plate) and was also impressed.  They had a nice kick with the spice level, so maybe not a recommendation for those sensitive to heat.  After the appetizer, he could only eat 2 of the tacos, so one was packaged in a to go box.  It also happened to be his birthday and when I mentioned it to the server, he was cool enough to buy the b-day boy a dessert on the house!  He ended up with their take on a Mississippi mud pie, which came in a Mason jar, complete with a candle.  I managed to steal a bite when he wasn't looking and can confirm that dessert is all sorts of chocolately goodness!  All in all, good experience.  Place was clean, service was prompt and friendly, prices were fair. They have tvs in the bar and ample patio space, and something on the menu for pretty much anyone!",

He added bacon and broccoli (I had never heard of broccoli in mac n cheese but he let me have a couple bites at end and it was surprisingly really nice.) for $4 which seems pricey but its a nice, hearty portion served in this ginormous bowl so....Idk prolly worth it. My tots were killer! They aren't hashbrown-y tater tots like mom baked for you, they're soft mashed potatoes rolled around cheese and then fried so similar to croquettes but super fluffy and delicious and just a lil spicy. The jalapeno mayonnaise/sour cream sauce is nice too. You get 8 to an order and they're about the size (maybe a lil bigger? Idk) of those giant marshmallows. Trac(e)y also made a killer Moscow mule. She's worth the visit and the food's pretty great too.",

    "text": "I am SO SO SO happy this placed finally opened!!! I wasn't so sure about the Vig here, since I'll be honest and say I'm not a huge fan of the Arcadia one. But they have really exceeded my best expectations!  So much, that this has become my new fav Sunday spot! I casually went in a few Sundays back because I wanted to watch a World Cup game somewhere. I sat at the bar and was so impressed, I have found myself going back every Sunday since & will still continue, now that the games are over!    I'll start with the service - I was actually surprised to see some negative reviews below on service, bc that's the main reason I keep returning.  But maybe I keep lucking out bc the same two female bartenders have worked each Sunday I've been.  I know I'm going to mutilate the spelling of their names on here, but Im going to go for it in hopes that others patrons that had bad experiences can look out for these 2 gems! Their names are Elyse & Malease (haha, simple to remember since they rhyme...just not so easy to spell lol). Anyway, they have given me superior service! I have a number of food allergies and Malease was not only pleasant & patient w/me, but offered some great suggestions.  No matter how busy they are, they always keep an eye on our drinks & we never have to wait on refills.  They are also attentive with our meals, making sure everything comes out properly, we have all utensils & condiments, and simply just making sure we are completely satisfied. Malease even noted possible allergens in condiments for me!!! Unless you have allergies, you never really realize how valuable that is to someone.  And whenever things slowed a bit, they weren't your typical bartenders who ignore you and played on their phones, these ladies came over and were both so personal, sweet, and hilarious!  I think they do a really great job at reading people...when I wanted to focus on the games, they saw that and wouldn't interrupt. But if they saw my eyes wander or get bored, they were there to make me smile.  So kudos to this tag team!  They've made a regular outta me!  Ok, now the food - being that we have come for the past few Sundays, my bf and I have prob tasted at least half of the menu so far and I can't name one thing I haven't liked as of yet! Some of our favs so far are the corned beef & French toast for brunch and the fish tacos, salads, & the hot chick for lunch. If you have allergies, like me, let the staff know and they were more than happy to accommodate, which is rare.  And as for booze, you can't go wrong w/bottomless Mimosas and they use Tito's (a fav) for their bloody bar! Delicious.   So I absolutely recommend this place to everyone!  It's got it all...good food, great service, and perfect atmosphere!  And for those who had a bad experience, I saw give it another go...I'm sure they had some kinks in the beginning, which is totally normal. They def seem to have their rhythm down now...well, at least at the bar. I've never sat at a table, so I can't voice any suggestions towards that.",

On az Monday night there were 6 guests total and at least five employes behind the bar. I waited 30 minutes as they chatted with each other, walked past me without eye contact and I gave up and just went to a table to finish my drink while my friend went outside. The bartender then asked me if I wanted another drink and I told him I came there to eat but nobody took my order so I give up. He said okay then, no apologies and walked away. He went back to the group if employees and they had a great time chatting. Direct result of poor management, if they even have a manager. Waste of time when there are so many new restaurants nearby with good service and food.",

Our waiter and others were attentive and accommodating. I inquired about the size of the outdoor tv and because the gentleman didn't know, he went back and got a tape measure and let us know! Pretty awesome. Water filled consistently and timely, as we chose to eat outside on this day. I ordered burger and fries, it was tasty. I'd come again for happy hour for sure. The menu isn't extensive so not too many different dishes I'd try, but what they have, they do well & that's all u can ask for. If it's on the menu, u oughtta kno how to make it good and they do! I enjoyed my time here. Will enjoy outside even more once the fall temps come around. Nice establishment, really like the ambiance they got going. I didn't catch anyone's name, but they treated us well. From our group of 6, thank you!",

My previous experiences at the other branches have all been pleasant, good food, fast and kind service. However when I first arrived at the McCormick location, I felt like my presence was an annoyance to the hostess, who barely greeted us and led us to our seats without so much as a eye glance. This was also the case of our server, who clearly felt like she had better things to be doing. I was hoping the food would make up for the lack of interest from the staff, however once I received our food (our normal order at the other locations, The Prime Rib Dip, maple glazed salmon and the Crispy Calamari), we found the food to be under seasoned, lackluster and overall less tasty as compared to the Arcadia location. I would've complained about the food, especially the calamari, which was limp and soggy despite me asking for it to be EXTRA crispy, but our server did not come to ask us how things were until she was ready with our check. I am bummed about my experience, as it has been generally positive at the other location.",

(see pic)  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   The staff were all extremely attentive, without being intrusive.

The perfect wait staff that can anticipate without interrupting is unfortunately rare these days.  THE MENU   The food was amazing. The Vig has a very original and creative menu.

We were greeted right away and seated by the hostess. The restaurant had a modern layout with a trendy ambiance. We sat on the outdoor patio which had window/doors that opened into an open atrium where there were tables too (very nice). Water was poured and our waitress introduced herself right away.  We started off with a couple of beers and the Gauc & Chips. The Gauc was excellent fresh and spicy though the chips were a little lacking though they were fine. We ordered 2 entrees and told our waitress wanted to share the dishes. The Grilled Fish Tacos (blacken whitefish, spicy slaw, pico de gallo, tomatillo-avocado salsa) and the Chicken Pad Thai (chicken or shrimp, spicy tamarind sauce, rice noodles, egg, tofu, bean sprouts, peanuts, lime). I was pleasantly surprised that when we told our waitress we were going to share, the kitchen split the 2 dishes into 2, which was great. I thought the food, service, and ambiance was great, absolutely no complaints. I will definitely be back.",

We all ordered different items and I noticed no one ate much at all.  The drinks were great and the service provided by a female server (red hair -didn't get her name) was the only redeeming feature of this dining experience.  Very disappointing and embarrassing.   The Vig is usually pretty good but with all the other options in the area this was not a good choice.",

Also the secret sauce on the burger was pretty much just mayo so I'd skip it.   They recently changed their menu on august 1st and took away the prime rib sandwich. This was probably their best dish so that's unfortunate.   It sounds like they have plans to change their menu seasonally so we're hoping they bring it back.   My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken sandwich and said it was good.",

There's a real laid back charm to this Vig location, it's easy to be there and easy to just relax. I love how they have trivial pursuit cards on the tables so you can nerd out with trivia while you wait.   The Ribeye is awesome, nice and tasty with the perfect amount of fat and marbling, excellent cut of meat. Good sides, good food, good beers on hand, I'm a pleased eater.   I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area, highly recommend it to anyone nearby or visiting.",

This place was the perfect spot, the interior and environment wasn't too loud and had a loungey feel to it. They have huge portions that are easily shareable, good price point and great service.  Our group of 9 gals managed to squeeze into a tiny booth, but made do and understandably could not have a chair placed in the main walkway due to fire hazard reasons. Items we shared:  - Artichoke, Kale & Roasted Jalapeno Dip served with Pita and Chips: absolutely amazing, creamy, rich, not too greasy. Seriously addicting! - Nachos del Norte (Chicken): typical nachos with chicken, beans, cheese, guac, jalapenos, sour cream, salsa, olives and green onions - Hot Vings (Thai Sweet Chili): these are sticky, sweet and savory! chicken was cooked well, I loved the crispy coating! - Mac N Cheese (with Broccoli): rich, but not uncomfortably so. definitely a well cooked comfort food, the broccoli made it a less guilty treat! (At least I'd like to think so ...)  Others ordered (about 5) entrees due to dietary restrictions or due to appetite level. The portions of the apps and entrees were so large we actually had to take left overs home. Everything looked great and tasted good. The table also had about 5 alcoholic beverages. The total bill for 14 items came out to be around $130. Talk about an amazing price and it wasn't even Happy Hour!  The service was great, despite our large party. Waters were refilled, we were checked on and they even gave the birthday gal a complimentary drink. It was fantastic! The customers dining here were also very pleasant which made the entire atmosphere so much more. There is a wide range of ages here, so no worries on that! You can bet I will be back for their famous happy hour and I can't wait!",

I arrived with my party around 5pm in front of the host stand, the host was on the phone so we were not greeted right away, a second hostess came up  and greeted us and took us to a table.   The service was wonderful! Our server Garrett was super nice and gave us some drink recommendations. My friend and I got the stolee blueberry Moscow mule and it was delicious! Her husband and my boyfriend got some beers. Drinks came out right away and our waters were constantly refilled which was great! I always have a water test at places to see how good service is. They were spot on last night. The only thing I would say is, sometimes we would get a lime in our mules and the other times we didn't get one. We each ordered 4 of those drinks, maybe the bartender was just busy and forgot the garnish?  I ordered the double down hummus dip and the boys got the wings. My friend ordered wrong and got The Trifecta which are sliders but she's a vegetarian and can't eat that. I told her I would switch dishes with her. When the food came out Garrett remembered what I ordered and asked if everything was alright, we explained to him about the mishap. He was so nice and without hesitation offered to take it back and to get the dish my friend wanted. I told him it was alright and man those sliders were great! The pretzel bun and the sauce were so delicious on the beef patty.   When the check came we were all set and the manager took initiative to come and grab it for Garrett so we didn't have to wait, which we appreciated because after 4 mules I was ready to go home for a nap!  I am happy I came back for another chance at the Vig because the food, service, and ambience is great and I hope it stays this way! Definitely would recommend this place to friends family.",

Great dishes are the rib tacos and Vig burger and sides are large. The onion rings are to die for. Calamari isn't over breaded and the steak salad is excellent. We haven't tried everything yet but the nachos look like a meal for four. The service has been top notch every single time and the atmosphere isn't loud so you can have a nice conversation.   The large patio has heaters so you don't even know your outside, and a cozy fireplace with TVs to watch the game. Parking is easy but part of the front patio view is the parking lot which is a downer. They are remodeling so maybe that will change.   Glad to have this place so close as it's a no brainer, easy to get in and out, and a reliable place to take out of town guests for a great meal that's NOT in Old Town.",

But I stopped in for a lunch after a flight to PHX, and needed something to tide me over until a massive dinner.   I ordered the Tuna Nicoise Salad, which uses fresh Ahi tuna, seared tataki style, with a mixture of greens. I was not expecting tuna that good and a blend of veggies and crunchies that make this a memorable salad.   Also, I ordered an iced tea, or \"sweet tea\" in American. Normally a restaurant will serve you an unsweetened iced tea and then have you add sugar that can't dissolve in the cold liquid. I asked for a liquid sweetener and the waiter obliged happily with a shit glass of simple syrup.  Simply great!!",

We sat and had drinks for almost an hour to two prior to ordering and even throughout this time and the night out server was very attentive. I've desperately desired a mojito for months now and was delighted to find they had mint to do so. We had a mango and original both were excellent and were a mere $8.50 whereas many of their drinks were $10 or more.   I ordered the fish tacos off the app menu, came in a four pack and were good but nothing special. However the sauce that came with it was a nice touch.  Hubby had the chicken pad Thai, it was wonderful! Full of flavor, hefty portioning, a bit of spice but not burn your mouth so, and surprisingly it came with tofu that was cooked just right as to mimic mushrooms. Only downside was a lack of chicken ... Tsk tsk   Another downside is the lack of options, the menu is pretty limited and it's a bit pricey but overall it was good.",

They have great drink specials! I had their Heart of the Sun which was a sweet (mango puree) and spicy (jalapeno) cocktail.   Collectively we ordered:  Steamed edamame: Very generous helping of ~60 edamame, lightly salted and perfectly cooked.  Hot vings: These were super tasty with the right amount of crisp and it comes with about 10 pieces. You can also get the sauce on the side which is what I prefer.   Vig big bruchetta: This alone is enough to constitute a meal. Very fresh topped ingredients, avocado, corn, red onion and beans. Scrumptious!   Grilled fish tacos: Yum! It comes with 4 small soft tacos. Super delicious!  Can't wait to come back for happy hour!",

Manager didn't agree but I have worked in several restaurants and it is apparent that the oil needed to be changed.  The waiter was very sympathetic and agreed.. it really is disappointing when management doesn't see the issues.",

I came out of the night with a new friend. She had an original approach and catered to our every need without being aggressive. She engaged us in conversation without being intrusive.

We ordered a few glasses of wine, edamame (HH menu), Buffalo wings (HH menu), and then we each ended up getting a Hot Chick Sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. Food was excellent as always. Strongly recommend the sandwich, delicious.   Service was another story. My friend & I had a lot of catching up to do so we were there for a few hours (like 3) but I swear we only saw our waitress 3-4 times total. We actually had to wave her down a few times to order an entree and get another glass of wine. I was disappointed.  Also, I have gotten the Pad Thai before, and although its good it was very soupy. All the liquid/sauce in it sat at the bottom. Just felt different and weird to me.",

The service was quick and our waiter was attentive and very polite.  I had the blackened fish tacos and my friend had the Prime Vig Dip.  The fish tacos were tasty with a nice Cabo style sauce, salsa, chopped cabbage on soft corn tortillas.  The Prime Rib Dip was listed as medium rare on the menu but was served medium to well done.  Fairly common problem with lunch entries of this type.  My friend was o.k. with it but way to overcooked for my taste.  Served on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries.",

The sweet potato fries were AMAZING, and also came with curry sauce and ketchup which was great. Banana bread pudding dessert was HUGE, so definitely something to share. Service was great.",

The manager was a nice guy, and I know this first hand because he had to help us, at the very least, 5 times. Beer orders were mixed up, forgotten items from our lunches. We actually waited 30 minutes to get our 2 beers and 2 ice teas, then an additional 30 minutes for our food. I would love the hour and a half back that I gave to the Vig.",

When he did finally come over, he had zero personality and seemed really stressed out. We ordered drinks with him and already knew our food order too since we were waiting so long anyway. All of a sudden a female waitress comes over and tells me they didn't have the slider appetizer anymore because they ran out of pretzel buns. So having to order something else, I just went with the regular burger which is closest to the sliders I wanted and she said they would put it on a pretzel bun for me. All of the food was good, drinks were great as well but what really ticked me off was that they charged me for the pretzel bun. It is only 1$ but seriously???? I already had to order a more expensive entree because it was not possible to give me the sliders and then after I am inconvenienced to order something different, you charge me a fee for a bun? It just was bad and cheap customer service. Also the female waitress seemed to just continue taking care of us and we never saw that guy anymore so no acknowledgement of the transfer was strange too.  Overall it's good food and good drinks and I would definitely go back, I just hope the service is better next time.",

    "text": "Overall a pretty bustling scene on a Friday night at this new restaurant in a sleepy shopping center. Most tables were full at 9pm and we had a short 10 minute wait. The menu isn't really that big, but that isn't as much a concern as the food quality. The prickly pear shrimp salad was overpriced at $14 and involved five shrimp and no prickly pear taste at all, while my turkey sandwich was hurt by the usual - below average turkey quality. The fries, which don't come with the sandwich (even though the waiter says what do you want as a side) were thin and crispy and probably the highlight of the sandwich. This might be more of a scene place. The kicker was when the waiter disappeared about our food came and forgot to supply us with silverware. We flagged down a dude who turned out to be a customer dressed in black, but this guy came through anyway with a full setup and we were able to proceed to eat the salad ten minutes later. Beer prices are reasonable.",

For dinner I has the vigazz burger with fried egg and she had the black bean burger. Both were ok. I ordered my burger medium rare but it came out done. The black bean burger was dry. I didn't complain cause we were kinda full from our apps so we took our food home and get our dog the dry azz burger. Worked out anyways.",

Five minutes go by and no salad so I asked the bartender to check.  He tells me the kitchen is slammed and my order is being boxed up.  Almost ten minutes go by and still no salad.  At this point my friends nachos are soggy.  The manager brings out my salad with no apology, no offer to come back for Happy Hour to try again, nothing.  Will never go back.  Have been several times before and the service is never what I'd call fast but this is pretty lame.  Too many other good restaurants to go to.  Plus with the tip my wedge salad was $15.  Yes they charge $12 for a wedge of lettuce.",

    "text": "I tried The Vig last night for the first time, my girlfriend and I ordered take out and were quoted 15-20 minutes on the phone. We showed up roughly 20 minutes later and sat at the bar, where we paid for our meal. We then proceeded to wait 10 minutes... 20... 30... and finally we asked the barback again if the order was ready. He was vague, disinterested, and seemed bored, saying again that it would be \"about 5 more minutes.\" I was so surprised that a restaurant I've heard so many good things about had such poor service! But less than a minute later the actual bartender came over to us and apologized profusely for the long wait, explaining our order had been caught behind a large tables. He apologized again and offered us a $25 gift card for our long wait. He brought our order out a few moments later, apologizing again for our wait time. That is a fantastic example of great service to remedy a less than ideal situation! He was kind, professional, and genuine, all things I greatly appreciate in the restaurant industry. Shout out to the tall, blonde bartender, definitely turned a bad experience into a good one!  On a last note - the food was FANTASTIC! I ordered the Black Bean Burger and it was probably one of the best vegetarian burgers I have ever had. I highly, highly recommend this place if you are a vegetarian like myself, as they had a great selection of non-meat items and a great vibe for happy hour or date night!",

The place has decent food and good drinks but the service there is so consistently bad that the food and drinks can't make up for it.    After being sat and having you first drink order taken, go ahead and get comfortable because it's probably going to be a while before you see your server again.  Every time I have gone there it always seems like I have to flag somebody down to get another round or food order in.  When you actually do get your food and/or drinks it's pretty decent.  I particularly like their prime dip and their Mac and Cheese.  Their edamame is great as well.  Half the time though, getting your food or drink and getting it how you want it is a whole battle in itself.  I've had them completely miss items I've ordered or when I ask for something with no mustard etc. it doesn't come that way.   I really want to like this place, I really do.  It's across the street from where I live and the overall concept is good; it's just poor execution on the staffs part.  I also work down the street at a hotel and often get asked for recommendations in the area.  I just can't recommend this place anymore. It's kinda frustrating because I just want to walk in there and yell \"Take my money!\" All I ask is decent service in return.",
