    "text": "It wasn't that great. Actually, the best part was the free chip they gave us in the beginning. We had a few sushi rolls. The tuna had almost no taste. I think there was cucumber wrapped in with it, all I could taste was water. Maybe the fish was too fresh? If you want to argue freshness, I stand with Yasuda. I was charged $9 for an avocado roll. I should have asked if I would be charged a specialty roll price but still, it feels like price gouging no matter what. The baked salmon roll wasn't very good either. I don't know what they did to make it so gross. Added the sauce at the wrong time? It looked like melted cheese, it makes the taste and texture just a little off. Which really screws up the entire roll considering it's covered in it. Just imagine, thinned out mayo, heated until it begins to congeal. Then the whole thing fell apart. I've always been told that the quality of the rice and the chef's ability to roll is strongly reflected in how well It holds together. I've never had a roll fall apart quite as bad as this one did. It was kind of expensive too. I miss eating sushi in Chandler. It must just be the strong Asian community in that part of town. We spent over 45 on a small thing of edamame and 4 rolls. I could have spent so much less for better food somewhere else. Maybe the specialty entrees are where it's at here but honestly I'm not going to take the risk of dropping 20 dollars at a place that couldn't make a decent spicy tuna roll.",

Looking over the menu, they are quite expensive for what I am used to with Sushi. I know its Phoenix, and Sushi is probably pretty hard to come by, but to me this sushi was just average. We had a spicy tuna roll while waiting for our bento boxes and we both agreed it was just ok. A rainbow roll here goes for about 15$ which we both thought this was on the high side compared to some other places we visit.  The service was excellent and their staff was very friendly. Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch.",

    "text": "So this is a Japanese-owned sushi place. That might seem like a silly thing to mention but I've been to so many Korean-owned sushi places lately that I take notice when a place is actually truly Japanese. I don't mind the Korean places just like I don't really care if a pizza place is run by  Albanians instead of actual Italians. But there are some menu items that you will only find in a Japanese run sushi place. The Japanese run places are less  concerned with all sorts of fancy \"rolls\" and are likely to give you smaller sushi pieces because sushi is supposed to be \"hitoguchi\" - meaning one bite and it all fits in your mouth. Some of the Korean sushi places give you huge pieces of fish that you can no way fit all in your mouth in one bite. Sure you get your  money's worth but that's really not the point.    So I've been coming to Hana off and on for quite some time. Sometimes the place is too crowded and our group ends up sitting outside. It's nice if it isn't too hot or windy because it is much more quiet than in the actual restaurant.     For appetizers, the kaki is pretty good if you're into oysters. Agedashi tofu is also usually a good choice. I was a little disappointed with their yakibuta - I guess only  because I had a killer variation at another restaurant which  I can't help comparing it to.     Sushi is always pretty decent and fresh tasting here. It's pretty much what I come here for. I just check off the items on the sushi list and let them roll in. If you get the eel sushi, that is usually the last item that comes because it is considered a little sweet because of the sauce - so that's like a dessert.     Speaking of desserts, I always get the Hana An Mitsu - aloe vera, mandarin oranges, blueberries, and red bean paste with  a cherry on top. Most restaurants won't have this but this is definitely a very Japanese dessert. Tottemo Oishii desu.     Parking is easy to find since it's a mall but there's a bunch of restaurants in the same mall so you might not be parking close to the restaurant.",

    "text": "I've been coming here since they opened around five years ago, and I have been a regular customer since. I'm what you could call a devotee. So consider that when you read this gushing review.  This is a family-run, neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall storefront next to a hair salon and a small boxing gym.  It's not a fancy place. But don't let that fool you.  The people in the kitchen and the sushi bar have impressive restaurant credentials going back many years and across the pacific.  They are fanatical about food quality, to the point where I've seen them toss what any other restaurant would call a perfectly good fish shipment if it was not up to their standards. They are friendly and gracious, and your enjoyment of the food is foremost. It's a place where you can sit at the sushi bar and ask the chefs to decide what you're eating, trust Koji and Lori, and be impressed with just about everything.    The sushi and sashimi are extremely fresh and very tasty, and they always have some sort of unusual or seasonal fish special you can't find anywhere else.  They don't have a ton of variety on the menu--maybe 12 or 15 rolls, the usual assortment of nigiri, and then sashimi and hand rolls--but what they do have is made with top-quality ingredients and delicious. Sushi bar specials are on the board behind the chefs and they're happy to take time to explain what they are.  And even though I go there primarily for sushi the kitchen items have never disappointed.  Noodle dishes and soups are hearty and very reasonably priced, and for lunch they have a large selection of bentos that include rolls and sashimi so you can have the best of both worlds. They even have a wonderful steak and lobster combination that would give any fancy steakhouse in town a run for its money.    If there are any complaints I could possibly have, it's that the table service can be a little spotty at times. It just seems unorganized because there's enough staff to handle it, but everyone seems to be doing every job rather than having a host, a server, a runner, etc.  Nevertheless, I can't recommend this place enough for a casual yet delicious meal.",

We especially enjoyed the volcano and at the end of our meal, our server suggested the dynamite roll for a return visit. We were still hungry and stoked so we ordered it right then. It was amazing and delicious.   For our lunch the service was spot on and really friendly. I totally enjoyed the sushi chef and helper thanking us for coming in.

They are small and cosy, but very friendly and helpful.  Admittedly, the first time I went I was a tad bit underwhelmed with the service, as the girl was efficient but very reserved. Feels strange after the chattiness of most wait staff! But the fish was excellent so we went back, and really, they are all lovely, just not as effusive as usual. Best feature of all is the BYO - bring beer or wine and they will provide the cups and keep your bottles in the fridge. No charge!  The Rainbow Carpaccio is sublime, the sashimi is always fresh, and most importantly, they have fresh wasabi. Now fresh wasabi is a new experience for me, but it is so far beyond the standard wasabi paste, it will knock your socks off. I am now seriously disappointed when I go to an upscale sushi restaurant and they do not have it.  I've moved now, and have not managed to find anything as good. Lucky lucky downtown Phoenicians, take advantage of this great local sushi joint.",

As per your advice, I ordered the special Hana Egg dish that's batter fried and served perfectly poached with a divine sauce.  Took a lot of effort to not lick the plate when I was done.  And my husband who never willingly orders salad as his entree was superbly pleased with the Gyuniku Tataki - luscious slices of prime beef over crisp greens.  There was NOTHING left on his plate, and it was a large serving. Our teenager devoured the massive Yakibuta Ramen soup dish, but it was so huge we have leftovers for tomorrow (or a midnight snack tonight!).  The pleasant surprise of a little platter of rice balls & fried wonton \"chips\" for our little one before we placed our orders was a lovely touch that she certainly enjoyed.  Definitely worth the drive from Chandler, and we will surely return!",

    "text": "I like what Hana is not, as much as what it is.  It's not a concept. There arent any consultants or flowery speeches or aquariums flown in from Hawaii. Just quality fish prepared and served by what looks to be a talented and gracious extended Japanese family.   And by quality I dont mean it's Bluefin of The Highest Order or The Stylings of Nobuo, necessarily, just that Hana's stock is better than most Phoenix places you're likely to walk into.    This Sonoran cheapskate thinks prices are generally fair for what you get.  $16 Umi No Sachi is a lightly dressed spring mix topped with a dozen or so sizable slabs of sashimi. Yeah, a dozen.  Big noodle soup bowls with tempura sides are $9-10. An appetizer of eight or so small fried oysters, crunchy outside, moist and briny within, was only $6.95.   Tables are too close together and the whole strip mall vibe is kinda cramped, if that sort of thing bothers you. The downside of BYOB is that the drink selection isnt very interesting.   All coastal cities have Japanese joints like this, but I'm delighted these folks decided to set up shop in CenPho. If you need the cushy banquette and garish aquarium, go to Scottsdale. If you need to impress a jaded epicure, try Nobuo at Heritage Square.  If you just want a solid, authentic and accessible Japanese fish fix, pay a visit to Hana.",

    "text": "I have had good and bad experiences at Hana in the past, and overall, I like their sashimi choices, but last night was the final straw. The wait staff is very hit and miss, with most being fun and friendly but a few being the typical 'cooler than thou' hipster wanna-be types that seem to plague Central Phoenix restaurants these days.   I can overlook the BYOB (which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish) and the sometimes attitudey service, and even the ho-hum rolls offered (nothing special, really). But what I cannot overlook is the ridiculously overpriced items and the blatant overcharging. My partner and I were going to order the oysters, and when we were told it was $9 for 2 oysters we politely declined with more than a bit of amusement. 2 oysters, really? Durants, which has amazingly fresh oysters, presented incredibly, and is one of the priciest restaurants in the area charges $13 for a half dozen- in a far better atmosphere.   Ok, so then I order the Chirashi bowl, which apparently is not on the menu but they will do it anyway. I always get the Chirashi as it is my favorite item at sushi restaurants, and Hana does a very nice one indeed- for $35!!! Of course you don't know this until AFTER you get the check since it's not listed anywhere. I understand that I ordered it and I should have asked, but honestly I have ordered this a hundred times from SF to LA to NY (and even at HANA before!!) and have NEVER seen it more than about $20-22. Locally, it goes for $19 at Stingray, and $17 at Sakana (which btw is much better).   Anyway, I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this, but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time, they think they can get away with it.  We'll see what happens now with Stingray opening up nearby, and Moira downtown, along with a few other newbies scheduled for openings in 2010. Competition is a great thing!   Some advice for sushi lovers: it's a bit of a drive, but Sakana is still hands down the best sushi in town- with a full bar and dinner for two in the $50 range, including drinks.",

I dine in sometimes, but I often get it to go, since I live nearby. It's pretty busy in the nights, especially the weekend.   The nigiri and sashimi are my favorites on the menu. My usual run to Hana includes eel nigir, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, and sometimes salmon sashimi. They are very generous on their cuts of sashimi, and I don't feel ripped off as I have at other restaurants with paper thin slices of fish. They are always mindful if you have any food allergies and will ask you up front if you have any. So all you lactose-intolerant folks, definitely check out this place.   Expect to pay around $40 for a nice amount of sushi, but you will leave satisfied and know you're paying for fresh and great quality food.",

We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the store. But, although it was small, the food was excellent and the service was over then top. It's a great neighborhood/family spot with BYOB. We were wondering about the prices until the order arrived and saw we absolutely got our money's worth. Definitely our new goto place for sashimi.",

For those who know little about sushi I'm sure this is \"awesome bro\" but my experience with sushi is a lot more deep than most of the patrons here, I'm pretty sure..... the miso soup was fine. The rolls were fine. Actually nothing was great or even good. It got two stars because of the service, which was very good. My advice to the owners, lose the hipsters who think they are cool and get some sushi chefs who know how to correctly cut fish and serve it appropriately. Anyone who knows anything about sushi will understand this review.",

    "text": "This place was really awesome! The service was phenomenal & they accommodated my boyfriend's shellfish allergy better than any restaurant we've ever gone to! They really went above and beyond.   So I'm Japanese from Hawaii & really miss Japanese food when I'm in Arizona. I have found a few places that have been okay, but so far Hana is the best Japanese I've had in Phoenix! A little on the pricey side, this has the best actual Japanese food (not just sushi). Previously I said Hiro Sushi, but for Japanese food other than sushi - Hana has taken the crown. We tried the shrimp & veg tempura, chicken tatsuuaage (karaage), a philly roll (no shellfish :P), ahi, gyu tan bowl (sukiyaki), mochi, and probably some more that I forgot. Everything was good and here's where I was really impressed - normally because places fry everything in the same fryer, if you have a shellfish allergy you can't eat ANYTHING fried. However, Hana was so accommodating and made it possible for my boyfriend to finally try tempura (their's is very light!). They really accommodated us --- thank you for great service!   A few things were a little overcooked/I wouldn't order again, but their tempura & sukiyaki were both 10/10!!! Can't wait to return here & I definitely will be soon!",

So when some good friends invited us out to Hana we were expecting of more and the same.  What we got was something that stood from the sea of bland rolls that most of us experience.  You have to elbow your way through countless hipsters to find a spot but by the time your first tray of flaming Salmon Sashimi arrives all is forgiven and you are well on your way to one of Phoenix's finest sushi experiences.",

Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.  For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.  With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.  Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.  Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.  Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.  Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.  Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?  Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.  Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.",

I would suggest steering clear of the Lil Dyno... It's weird combination of textures and flavors and served hot on a piece of foil. Just not my cup of tea.  In my opinion, the atmosphere is a little more casual than their prices would suggest.  That said, the environment is cozy and intimate... Perfect for a date night (or if you are flying solo there are plenty of seats at the sushi bar).  TIP:  Be sure to ask for the fresh wasabi - amazing!

I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food.   Well Hana is not it... :P  But it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso.   In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!",

    "text": "I recently dropped by one of my favorite local, family owned and operated restaurants to warm my belly with delicious hot food.  Why do I emphasize the word hot here?  Well, This particular restaurant happens to be Hana Japanese eatery, my favorite place for sushi in Arizona.  On this particular night, the mercury had dipped into the forties and I was in the mood for for something to counter the chill.  I tweeted @HanaJapanese asking what was recommended and commented that i'd happily put my stomach into their hands.  What followed was simply perfect.  Miso Ramen A large, piping hot bowl of Miso Ramen soup was first brought to the table.  Steam from the delicate, flavorful broth wafted into my nose causing my mouth to water.  Generous amounts of ramen noodles paired with scallion, subtle spices and pork absolutely hit the spot.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor, texture and warmth this lovely bowl of soup delivered and have since found myself craving more.  While doing damage to the aformentioned ramen, my server brought over a propane fired hibachi grill along with a tray of assorted vegetables and strips of raw steak.  The grill was lighted and I was instructed to add the vegetables (asparagus, pumpkin, okra, long beans and portobello mushrooms) and then grill the meat to my desired temperature.  Forget going to kitchy chains like Benihana or Sapporo where the show is more important than the food, grilling it yourself using quality ingredients and truly becoming a part of the experience is where it's at!  (not to mention, everyone seemed to be ooh-ing and ahh-ing at what was going on at my table adding to the over-all cool factor).  Hana Hibachi Steak  Hana Sauteed Lobster While the miso ramen was warming and hit the spot and the Hana Hibachi steak couldn't possibly have been better, it was the Hana Lobster saute that really made my night.  Tender chunks of well seasoned, perfectly sauteed lobster served with pieces of chopped asparagus lay before me begging to be snapped up by my eager chopsticks. I just ate and smiled, you have to order this dish and enjoy it to understand how good it really is.  I simply must mention the dessert here, green tea mochi in this case.  I am at a rare lack of words to describe the texture of this little gem. Green tea ice cream encased in a flour and sweet rice dough that was firm, slippery, sweet and refreshing all at the same time.  I hate using word like \"delicious\" to describe food because it doesnt really tell you anything about the experience but I will here because this mochi is a little weird, fanciful and yes, DELICIOUS!  Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple, quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important, while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly, the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer, sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own.",

    "text": "One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.    I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.  Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.    Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered: Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had) Spicy scallop nigiri (good) Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces) Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch) Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)  The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave.   Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.",

As I walk in my friend was sitting alone at the sushi bar and motioned for me to sit on his right hand side when the maitre d at told me that I I was supposed to set in the last seat,   which was the left of my friend. As I proceeded to sit down on the right hand side of my friend the maitre'd rushed right up and said no you sit at the end. You have to understand, we were the only two customers in the entire restaurant. Plus, my friend ordered two orders of the miso soup and when they brought them they seemed surprised and said we thought this was just for you. meaning my friend Anyway, we were  both so uncomfortable that we walked out of the restaurant immediately  and plan never to go back. I can't tell you if the food is any good. I went there several years ago and it was so so. The atmosphere and the service leaves a lot to be desired. My friend who is there first also mentioned that as he entered the restaurant the maitre d said that he had to ask the manager before you could even sit him and this is in an empty restaurant Bizarre place.

This place and been highly recommended and we drove across town to get there expecting the best sushi in town.  The sashimi was good, but not as fresh as typically offered by our neighborhood sushi restaurant.  In addition, it was not cut by the chef correctly,  leaving it thin with an odd texture.  The rolls were much better, but were on the small side.  However,  the restaurant was charming, the service was great, and the food was otherwise good.  I can see why this place is always busy with regulars.   It's just not worth the drive across town when we have other more convenient options that we prefer.",

We ordered the Hana bento box combo which includes salad, miso soup, six chef's choice sashimi, California roll, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and some kind of pickled veggies. The good was the fish, very fresh. The bad was almost everything else, nothing special about it, we could get the rest of this at almost any Japanese restaurant. The prices were high for what you get and there wasn't enough food for the high prices. Anyways disappointed and despite the high reviews on yelp and being on phxfoodnerds approved list for 2013, first place I've tried on this list the doesn't make the cut, this place is just like any Japanese eatery with higher prices and the food tastes average.",

The only issue about this place though is that out of all the rolls we got (Spicy Tuna, Alaskan, Las Vegas, Volcano), the only one that I would get again would only be the spicy tuna. The Spicy Tuna had so much flavor and I was like YESSSS! so good. I wish I got one of those sushi boats though..that looked awesome.  My friends loved all the rolls though, I am just very picky.  Anyways, if you go here, I recommend the Spicy Tuna roll..and I guess all the other rolls (since my friends thought it was amazing).  I'm pretty sure there were other rolls that are great though, and the service was awesome. I will definitely come back here again.",

Most of the time I don't even bring liquor with me and still have the time of my life. That's how truly phenomenal Hana is. Don't go to get wasted. Go to enjoy your meal.   The only items I've had here consist of sushi, so if you're looking for recommendations on cooked food, this is not the review for you.  Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar.  I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them.   Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too.  Hana's a small joint. Sometimes there's a little bit of a line. Nevertheless though, it never seems to ever be so crowded anyone gets annoyed. The staff is efficient, and the sushi is worth it.",

Spicy tuna rolls were tiny (hardly any tuna) and a very small serving size. The Hana roll with several fish types war apples in cucumber fell apart when we tried to pick up by hand or with chopsticks. Fish was room temperature and slimy. The rainbow roll was decent, but the room temperature fish really bothered me. The best food was cooked, but still below average (goyza, tempura, edamame).  Another party of 3 and our group of 3 waited 15 minutes to be seated even though hey had two larger open tables that seat 5. Their rationale: Maybe a smaller table could free up? We arrived around 7:45pm and finally got seated around 8pm. Totally unnecessary! Service was also dicey.  Next time, I will drive the extra distance to go to one of my regular spots.",

I've lived in Japan for several months while studying there and have been back numerous times, so I can have high standards for Japanese food. I understand standards are lower here in Phoenix, but still I've had far better at other non-Japanese restaurants here in the Valley.   We first arrived and we're greeted by a nice waitress. She took our drink orders and told us about the specials. \"Car-agee chicken\" \"What?!\" I'm not a Japanese language snob, but if you work in a Japanese restaurant that claims to sell Japanese food, at least learn the proper pronunciation of the dishes. It's \"kah-rha-ah-geh chicken\"   Next came the food. My dad order the Tai special at the suggestion of the waitress. Should've known better judging by her knowledge of Japanese food. It was 4 small pieces of over-cooked fish for $23. What a rip!   My food was mediocre at best. The sushi rice was plain-- no rice wine vinegar as is customary for properly flavored sushi rice. Tempura was ok but the sauce did not come with shredded daikon.   For shame, Hana! You're giving Japanese food a bad name!",

I probably would have gone with three stars, but given my wife's even poorer food, I have gone with two, which means I would have to be hard pressed to return. First, most of the food was kind of tasteless. The octopus salad, which I ordered because of memories of some wonderful octopus at this restaurant in the past, was truly blah and the octopus gave the sensation of eating bits of plasticized mushroom. The cucumber and daikon salad was also lacking in taste. My fried oysters were lacking in seasoning but were at least decent. My wife had the ramen and described it as salty and otherwise flavorless and commented that what little meat there was had been overcooked. The coup de grace was her salad. As she said, \"You have to go some to make a ginger dressing I don't like, but they went the extra mile.\"  I can only hope that my friend, who is to polite to say anything, had a better dining experience than we.",

I've lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and never ventured in, I can't believe I've been missing out.   Shrimp tempura was delicious, as was the sushi, miso soup, and the ginger salad.",

    "text": "Uhhh... WOW!!!  So I went here with a large party of 9 which is a little but difficult at this place, because it's a bit smaller so we had to wait til two tables near each other opened up.   Once seated, the service was like a whirlwind! It was just too fast. Lol. Attentitive, but fast... There was no time to sit and relax. You have to look at the menus and decide before you take your next breath! My friends and I were a bit stressed and felt under pressure. Lol.   So after looking at the menu, on the specials menu, one item in particular popped out at me, which was the gyu don. I've had gyu don before. Usually around 9 bucks, and I like it a lot, however this pricing was around 16.95. I'm a firm believer of you get what you pay for. Here, it included tofu, mushrooms and thinly sliced beef. The server says it takes a little longer than everyone's but it is worth the wait. And I said okay! And of course, it was the last one to arrive at the table.   Oh man! That was pretty delicious!! I loved it. It was like a stew. The broth by itself is kinda salty from soy sauce, but it's fantastic with rice, and the tofu, shrooms, and beef were all so beautifully marinaded because of it!  Also, the presentation of my friends' sushi was spectacular! There was a sugar cube that was on fire on this plate of really attractively arranged sushi.   So despite being stressed out in the beginning, the food really was impressive. Plus, it's byob so the server said we didn't have to wait to sit to pop open some of our beverages.",

I have no idea what the word is for it in Japanese but you have to get it. It's the best bite I had the entire time there.   I would definitely go for a mix of sushi bar and kitchen when ordering or you'll miss out on something wonderful. Hannah also gave us real wasabi which was bomb.

At first glance, it doesn't look like much and out of all places a sushi joint is here!  Needless to say once you walk in the place is cozy with a hip mom & pop feel.  It's definitely dark in here, but that lounge cool feel is hot right now so I can't complain.    I'm not a big sushi eater, but my friend ordered some and thought it was pretty good.  I'll have to agree since I only took one bite.  What I ordered was amazing!  Ebi Yakisoba noodles they served here was wonderful.  There was something about the sauce that they mixed.  I asked the waitress, but apparently its chef secret.  That extra sweet after taste left in my mouth is unforgettable, but I can only say it's similar to a kimchi sweetness without the spice.  Definitely one of the best yakisobas I had in a while and that's what's going to keep me coming back since I can't figure out what's in that sauce!  Darn the food gods!  Why must to toil with my palates! - Enjoy!",

However, I was not impressed with the food. For appetizers, we order edamame and some pork slices (forgot the name). Portion for the edamame was really small and just lightly salted. It was also very cold, as if it just came from the freezer.  We then order two rolls, spider and rainbow rolls. They dont' really have a good selection of rolls for you to choose from. Each roll is about $15. Again, very very dissapointed with the small portion. I think we only get 5 pieces a roll for the $15 price. Also, the 2nd roll didn't even come with wasabi and gingers. The taste was nothing exceptional to justify the price and portion. We left the place with a $50 bills and still hungry. I hate to say that I don't think I will return again",

I went for the first time on 2/15/2013 for dinner with my husband based on the reviews I read here and elsewhere that this place was really great and was craving some awesome sushi. When we pulled up I was a little disappointed as it is kind of in a strip mall area that I am not familiar with. However, after eating the food, the place could be in the middle of a landfill for all I care.   We had the Hana Pride roll, uni shooters, japanese mint leaves stuffed with tuna, a yellowtail roll, an order of tuna nigiri and the tuna tataki roll. We also split their ribeye steak with shrimp. I was amazed by how fresh and delicious the sushi was. Really interesting choices that were all different but each delicious in their own way. I highly recommend the Hana Pride even though it is one of the pricier menu options because it is really awesome and totally worth the money. Besides, BYOB saves you a lot. The only thing that we could have done without was the steak, not that there was anything wrong with it. The sushi was just so good that the steak was outshined.   Service was also impeccable! They refrigerated our beers and sake and were great at clearing the plates on our very small table.   Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner.  I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef.  So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight!  Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment.  However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana.  Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA.  For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix.  I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning.  Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint.  My second experience was quite a bit different.  I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists.  For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming.  They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each.  One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar.  Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping.  (It made me cry, it was so delicious.)  A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth.  (And I cried again.)  There was no sushi on our table.  That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish!  A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish.  (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.)  Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on.  The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar.  And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind:  Walk into Nana. Ask for Lori, the owner. Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you. Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200. Tell Lori to show you something amazing.  Forget about the menu.  Let the experts decide for you.  Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day.  Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame.  There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen.  It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll!  I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.",

An absolute must stop when I am back in Phoenix to see my family.  The Hana roll and poki chips are definitely favorites.  Tonight we all had the Shake salmon dinner and I had the Maguro.  Don't worry about the Phoenix location, you would not get a table if Hana was in Scottsdale....their loss and your gain!  Thanks Koji, Lori and Lynn",

    "text": "1.  Got off to a bad start--tried to call but their phone only has an answer machine. No Email contact either.  Hard place to find.  Bad location and dumpy outside.  I never would have gone in unless I had not seen them on yelp.   Small--has less than 12 tables although  bar stools as well.  2.  This place has more employees than customers, so finding service is no problem.   With the high  prices they charge there is enough money to  hire.  One order of sushi and one chicken balls for $20.  But you wouldn't pay any less in Snottsdale, and the food was first rate  and  you can bring your own booze, which cuts the bill down.  3.  NOTE:  they don't take reservations but this place is always packed. 8:30 on a slow weeknight, and few seats available.  I will be going back, but not on a busy weekend.  4.  Also--I have been around a while and can spot a gay/lesbian hangout a mile away. This is one of them--could tell by the male ear fashion and  Hillary butch haircuts. Not that I care but if you do you might not like it here.  My guess was correct for when i was leaving I saw a bunch of gay magazines in a rack.  LOL",

We had the following:  -Bento Box (Sashimi cuts were generous but the I dont think it can be compared to the the freshness of the stock in DC metro or Vancouver BC or Singapore scale). California roll was just bland. Tempura was greasy and had a funny smell. Salad & Miso was average. -Fiery tuna roll was worse than our local supermarket pre-fab. Absolutely no taste, more like a blob.  - Octopus tempura was too greasy and a funny oil smell. - Pan Fried Soba: plenty of veggies but what a bland prep!  Bottom-line: You can pick up better plates in a plastic box from your supermarket isle. To be fair, I cannot compare this place to other local joints. My reference scale may not be calibrated to the right standard. Looking at the wait list I cant tel that its all yelp hype. May be this is the best you can get in the middle of a desert. My expectations were not  in line.  So if you are from near the coasts and have refined Japanese palette, pass HJE and look for Mexican food while you are this close to the border.",

Just so everyone is clear about BYOB - we were a little nervous to walk in with a bag of wine bottles, but its completely OK. They will provide wine glasses for you, and a corkscrew if you need it. They will let you bring wine, beer, sake, basically anything isn't distilled liquor. So don't bring in vodka and mixers.  If you order enough sushi, they will put it on a wood \"boat\". Also, some entrees and rolls come out with a flaming sugar cube - a nice, fun touch.  We'll be back many, many times.",

I rarely get anything \"bold\" (for me its the safe nigiri and sushi and roll options), but for those with a wild side, it seems they have you covered.

The place is small...we had to wait standing in line for about an hour and a half. I wish it was shorter or we could've made a reservation but with the way women get ready...I didn't know if I was going to arrive within 10 minutes of my reservation or 10 days (let's be honest here). I then asked and I think I recollect that they don't take reservations.  The parking is somewhat tight when it's night time. Apparently, this is where they get the most business. However, I guess you can always park in the neighborhood streets just a few feet away.   It's BYOB. You can bring your own alcohol. I wish I would've brought Moscato but we didn't know until I asked.   Our waitress service was slow, but we sat up front and the Sushi Master was a old Japanese guy...quite nice guy. He attended to us very well.   Their prices are a little higher than what I'm accustomed to from eating at places like Saki Bomber's or Kabuki but I like watching the food being made in front of me.  I would say the food is very fresh but let's face it...the coast is in California and we all know about the drive from there. However, the food was still very delicious. We also bought some of the soup noodle to go. That was very delicious still when we got hungry later on.  They had this very cool menu item I think where they bring you a wooden boat with fire and sushi on it. I came back a few days later with a friend and ordered it. Very good.  Overall, I thought this place was a very nice date night place. The wait sucks but  it's worth it. We came out full and with a few takeout boxes.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with OUR overall portions & inflated price.  Our sashimi portions were thinly shaved slivers... They were almost as thin as the ginger slices - most of them ripped and transparent. The sashimi pics that others have posted on FB and here on Yelp, look large and generous.  That is not what we got!  Perhaps they were selfish with us because we weren't regulars.  Maybe they give bigger portions to other folks.  I don't know.   My husband and I were excited to go there late June 2013. It was our second time there in the course of 3 years.  The first time, we brought our 1 year old boy with us and we were treated \"carefully\" by the older woman.  She kept an eye on us as if she was worried our boy would throw food or be noisy.  He behaved well and we left satisfied.    I had recently been reading reviews and viewing pics on the super fresh sashimi. We were also excited to bring our own sake and beer. We had always forgotten in the past.  This time, we did not bring out boy.  We did bring our own booze but our bill was outrageous when we were all done even without alcohol.  We ordered lots of sashimi - six pieces each:  halibut -$12, Octopus at $10, striped bass at $10.  Also had a Vegas at $11.50, & Rainbow roll - I don't recall how much they charged for that one.  Anyway our bill was over $60 and they charged us $1.50 each for splitting the bill!  EACH of us.  That is cheap!  There were no sashimi combos offered on menu.  Must order each sashimi separately.    We are used to being lavished with giant chunks/slices of sashimi at Ah So on Bell.  We are regulars there.  Maybe that is why we get so much there.  Hana was not generous with fish at all especially the halibut. Paper-thin!  We will not be going back to Hana.   The ambience was fine.  Chefs were a little serious and gruff.  Servers seemed gruff too.  Rushed the bill.  Their price was just not worth what we got. The rolls and the portions of sashimi were just way too small.  We left hungry.  Not many sushi places in that area.  Cherry Blossom on 14th Street and Camelback is near.  They are more generous.",

I was a fiercely loyal patron of Zen 32 until it closed, and while Hana isn't as upscale as Zen 32 was, I think the food speaks for itself.  The fish was fresh and lovely and the squid salad was probably the best I've ever had.  I thought it was odd that the edamame was served cold, but everything else was on point.    Hana is super small and it is easy to feel crammed like sardines in there.  I like that it's BYOB because it cuts down on the bill.  The service was spectacular and prompt even on a very busy Saturday night.    I totally recommend Hana for a casual sushi experience.  Excellent food and service.",

Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!  Fist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED! We were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing.   I'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed!   We ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!",

    "text": "I haven't been to Hana's since it first opened. So its been quite a few years. As I made my return I slowly remembered why I haven't been to Hana's in... well, quite a few years.   I'm happy for them in one aspect because it looks like they have come a long way as far as the amount of diners are concerned. The pricing on the other hand is just ridiculous. Way overpriced for a small neighborhood operation. (And then again maybe that's why it is that way) That is just my opinion. Or at least compared to the major players I frequent. These are a couple of my favs. RA, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Broker's...even Kona Grill is gettin' some love.   Okay, so right off the bat I notice I have an appetizer of some sort made with Surimi (fish paste aka fake crab or krab) on some sort of fried dumpling chip (like a crab rangoon). I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is when some sushi restaurants make that the basis of many of their dishes. (i.e. the old Mr. Sushi located at Northern and I-17) So, basically their Surimi concoction is inside of every roll or in, on or alongside any other dish you may order. Okay, so back to the pricing. Now my thought is if you're going to have these \"unusual\" prices, please don't wave the former lower prices in my face by simply crossing them out on the menu in magic marker where I can still see them and replace them with higher prices. Just get a new menu. I'm cool with that. That's like going to the store to see a cool shirt you want to buy and you realize that it's 20 dollars but the  tag underneath says it was 10 dollars...now that's a bummer.  So, I end up ordering a Rainbow Roll (One of my staple sushi meals. You can't mess that up right?) that is close to 16 dollars. (Of course I have to look at the previous price of 10 dollars that is crossed out...bummer) I also order a Scallop Dynamite (which is one of my favorites at RA, so let's give it a try here.) That was up there in price too. I think it was close to 14 or 15 dollars as well. Anyway, both were disappointing. The Rainbow Roll had no shrimp on it and was filled with my favorite yummy Surimi concoction. (That's me being facetious) The Scallop Dynamite came out in some aluminum foil that was hand shaped to form a shallow dish. (I'm assuming it was prepared in this) Not only was that presentation ghetto fabulous it was primarily made of...you guessed it! Yummy Surimi Concoction! (That's me being facetious again) So, with these two items and a canned green tea my total was $36 and some odd cents not including the tip.   So, after I was helped off of the barrel and untied, I calmly pulled my pants back up, removed the ball gag from my mouth and walked out to my vehicle and left. The entire drive I was seething to get back and write this very review.  Although I must add that the staff was friendly and attentive. If I could give a 2.5 I would. I just can't bring myself to do a 3 in this situation.  Good luck Hana Japanese Eatery!",

Where else will you find striped bass and uni nigiri?  No where.  Trust me, I've looked.  In addition to the quality fish they serve, I appreciate their attention to detail (see flaming sugar cube on the corner of your plate of sushi).  Great service, great food, I will definitely be back.    Word of advice, stick to the fish dishes, the noodles are a bit of a let down.",

The Why: Fresh, clean, and best selected fish in the state, as far as I am concerned. This is the place for sashimi & nigiri. Rolls are good too, but it's the select fish that catapults this restaurant into the stratosphere. Be sure and try the fresh oysters. INCREDIBLE!  The How: Family run by those who know seafood and how to put it all together.  The Where: Centrally located in Phoenix at 7th Ave. & Missouri.  Be sure to get there early as you may have a wait, but it's totally worth it. This place is a destination for the discerning sushi patron. BYOB.",

We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table which wasn't so bad considering how busy it was.  The menu is very stream lined but the focus is still always dedicated to the freshness and quality of their sushi. We enjoyed salmon sashimi and uni sashimi. The spicy tuna roll was delightful and the spiciness did not overcome the fresh flavor of the tuna. One of my favorites, unagi nigiri, did not disappoint!   We definitely plan to return here. Our go-to will most likely be the scallop dynamite, which our friends ordered and we tried and loved. The uni oyster shooters were fun and yummy. It's a great way to introduce people who don't usually eat uni to enjoy the unique melt in your mouth texture. I'm slowly starting to enjoy uni since we order it so much. I think I could get others addicted to it too!",

The Hana Japanese Eatery not only has very wonderfully prepared and presented dishes, they also have impeccable service; which again made our dining experience fantastic. I had Yasi Yaki Udon. My mom had Tori Kara Age, and I had another noodle dish that I'm afraid I can't pronounce. For appetizers we had cubed tofu, and Tempura vegetables. The Jolly Diners rated the Hana Japanese Eatery at a 5 out of 5. It was busy,  and Beyer than the first time. They have plenty of sushi, dishes without animal products, and others with chicken and pork. We recommend this restaurant for people who appreciate well prepared, good food.",

My intention of coming to Hana was actually Hibachi, not sushi, which was perhaps my biggest misstep. But really, if the hibachi sucks (and it did) don't offer it at all, please! We all know what a normal \"cook on the table\" style hibachi grill meal entails: rice (white or fried), sauted veggies, soup and ginger salad + whatever entree is chosen.  Even if lacking the actual grill-table set up, the menu at Hana made their entree options out to be this very spread, but when our food came out, 'twas not the case. :( The volume was a joke for the price, and the food was barely mediocre.  Also, no fried rice option.  My husband enjoyed the one sushi roll we ordered (because we were both still famished after our failed entree) but I didn't-- it was baked and far too smothered in some sort of mayo to even pick up without it falling apart. Definitely won't be going back.  TLDR: Way too spendy for the quality AND quantity recieved.",

I have no idea what they're saying, but I always want to yell it back to them! Their yellowtail sashimi just melts in my mouth & their sushi is always so fresh and tasty. It even tastes better when they put it on one of their wooden boats. I typically never have room for dessert but this last time, I forced myself to order Mango Mochi. I had no idea what to expect, but now I'm officially obsessed with Mochi! I've never taken advantage of their BYOB option, but I think it's really cool that it's something they offer.

They said we were about to be seated soon so we waited.   we already knew what we wanted having waited so long so we quickly ordered.  We got our water once our food came.  We also got a few sushi rolls before appetizer and two people who ordered bento boxes had to wait longer. So we all waited and started digging in.  I have never had sushi roll that fall apart.  The volcano roll also was lack of fish and I've never seen that.  We had to ask to return one roll because it was just falling apart and we couldn't eat it.    The salmon roll and Vegas roll were really good.  Just the volcano was falling apart.  The Gyoza was also delicious. We tried the pork and vegetable.  So this can be hit or miss but I know I don't recommend it if you looking for some sushi in Arizona!!!",

I've been here multiple times for their sushi and yes, yes, yes hands down really good quality sushi/sashimi and they do BYOB- uhm what? Yes, come here.  I decided to do something different for a change and try their ramen- I've been in all sorts of Asian food withdrawals so yeah, ramen it was. I ordered the Tonkotsu broth ramen and an order of Salmon Nigiri, because the quality of their fish here is on point. The waitress was nice enough to confirm and even offer me an egg of which I quickly agreed, until I questioned what kind - a chicken egg, she replies ... uhm not exactly what I was asking. She later responds, oh soft boiled! She was so cute! Hahaha. Soft boiled eggs are my weakness, FYI. The tonkotsu broth was milky, good chewy noodles and fairly large in portion, the charshu was thick but oh-so tender and the soft boiled egg was perfect. It comes with menma, scallions, wakame and naruto garnish the top which are good flavor accents to the bowl of ramen.  The service here is good, love the dim and intimate atmosphere. Rick is always smiling and observant of his customers! I always feel welcomed and appreciated when coming here.  The total bill for the ramen and two pieces of nigiri came out to be around $18-20 with tip, which is a bit pricey for just ramen. However, it's pretty good in comparison than other ramen I've had here in Phoenix and the quality of the food and service here is downright great.",

My hub's nigiri was fine, the tako and ika were especially good.  But was it worth the hour drive and the30% larger bill? No.",

I keep going back, so that's got to say something (however, there aren't many other options in Central Phoenix, so that doesn't hold a TON of weight, per se)  I've been going here off and since they opened, and the food is pretty good. Service can be a bit off, I've even had rude service a time or two. On the flip side, I have also had some pretty good experiences (all though I almost always get takeout, ain't really diggin the BYOB thing. It was cute at the beginning, but after two years? really?).    My wife and I generally get the baked mussels, which are decent. I tried the Yakibuta today (slow roasted pork) which I really liked. The rolls are average, nothing to write home about (by home, I mean Seattle so I guess I could be a bit bias)  Overall this place is pretty good for the area, but it is a bit on the high-price side. If there were more options in the local area, no doubt they'd have to lower their prices a bit. Based on an article I read in New Times, there's going to be a Stingray Sushi opening up in Biltmore some time this year, so that may give Hana a run for it's money. My final verdict, meh.....",

First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share!  After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars.  They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short.  We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only.  We started with miso soup.  It was very *(salads arrive)* good.  Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up.  We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones.  I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well.    The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious.    Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner.  They arrived and were nice and hot.  The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful.  I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy.  The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most.  Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience.  The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian.  Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other.  We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other.  I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue.  The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table.  Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option.  Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal.  In summary:  the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\\\cold//\\\\warm//\\\\cold//\\\\warm//\\\\cold.",

We brought a bottle of wine because it is BYOB and ordered a ton of food (and spent a lot of money). As soon as we had eaten 90% of our food they came and brought the bill. Then they reminded my husband to give them his card. This is while we are still talking and drinking our wine and finishing our dinner. Then they brought the bill back completed and started clearing plates while we talked.  Finally a few minutes later a man walked up (while, again, we still hadn't finished our wine) and told us we had to get up and leave because it was a small restaurant and other people were waiting for our table.  There was only one party waiting for a table, but clearly it was more important to them that we leave since we had already paid and they weren't going to get any more money.",

    "text": "After living here for 6years, Hana is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, period. In fact, it's so good, I will not eat sushi anywhere else now.   Now, let me give you some context so you may determine if this review is for you:  Do you dip your rice in soy sauce? Do you add \"wasabi\" to your soy sauce? Do you eat rolls other than basic seaweed, rice, fish? Do you think the green paste is wasabi? Do you call the fish part of the nigiri, \"sushi\"?  If you said YES to any of the above (don't lie), this review is NOT for you. Otherwise, read on....  Hamachi Kama was brilliant; perfectly cooked and delicious. Yellowtail handroll was utterly amazing. The yellowtail handroll is my go-to. At Hana the fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and had the perfect fish to rice ratio which is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I also tried the halibut, striped bass, crab, masago with quail egg, and salmon. All the fish was the freshest, best tasting I have eaten since moving from Los Angeles. The sunomono was even amazing!  Help-wise, the service was spot-on. Extremely friendly and very attentive.  I can't say enough good things about this place. Disclaimer: I have yet to try Yasu, which I hear is amazing as well, but compared to every other sushi joint in Phoenix, THIS is the spot to go to. F everywhere else.",

Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).    One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.    I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!",

Hana is a good value for the cost of dinner. One can bring in one's own wine, beer or sake which is a terrific deal. I've taken in a flask full of sake, warmed up in my lap, for sake bombers and didn't get any funny looks. The fish is fresh (or at least we've been fortunate enough to not have any freshness issues) and brought out in a timely manner.   I understand we missed their 2-year anniversary. Bummer. I am happy to see they made it past this threshold. Maybe I'll see you there tonight?",

What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.  I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast.   The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough \"give,\" so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.  Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!  When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all.   Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.  That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.  But it is worth it. It is so worth it. Check it out!",

I'm going to call this part one of the review. Today was my first visit to Hana. The second part will be tacked on at some later date and this is why: THEY WEREN'T SERVING SUSHI. No. Really. Srsly. Being a brand new restaurant, apparently only one person (the server called him the \"Sushi Rock Star\") has been employed behind the counter rolling up sushi! I hope Hana can audition some more rock stars because I am anxious to audition a tuna roll.  The pork ramen had to suffice and it was served in a mammoth bowl at a temperature not unlike our galaxy's sun. After about 10 minutes, it had cooled off to the point where I could taste it and it was very good! Much better than those 73 for $1 jobbies at the grocery store.  The atmosphere was dark, and facing the door it was a bit distracting. It was kind of like being in a dark, seedy bar and having someone stand there with the door open... I imagine. The service was excellent and the server friendly. I felt sorry for him having to tell subsequent customers that they weren't serving sushi. It's kind of like going to a luxury car dealership and being told they only have Yugos. But hey... even rock stars need a day off.",

We are going to be waiting forever for a seat.\"  There was a big group waiting for a table and I was not happy because I was starving.  Luckily, we asked for a table for 2 so they had a table for us.  The service was quick, efficient, and they were friendly.  We started off with edadame, then this wonton chips which were delicious!  They were like chinese nachos.    The sushi was fresh and good.  I was quite impressed.  The parking lot is a private lot and parking is not an issue.  There is also an outside patio, but it looks quite small as well.  Prices were reasonable.  I would definitely go back when I get a sushi craving.",

Nothing exciting - The gyoza were not good - Service was friendly, but a little slow  If I'm in the area and jonesing for sushi, I'll go.",

While the menu is limited, they quality of the fish is the best that you can imagine in the desert. We ordered multiple types of nigiri and I think that overall the fish quality is good, but they need to work on their seasoning. The rice had such a faint vinegar taste, that with any strong fish, you couldn't even tell it was there. The fish slices were also not seasoned at all. I typically try a piece just as is to taste for quality and seasoning, but this was one of the first times, I really felt like I needed to add soy sauce and wasabi to all the fish slices.   In addition, we ordered the sake steamed clams, the gyudon nabe and okonomiyaki. The sake steamed clams were excellent but we had to send the first one back due to them having way to much sand in them. The gyudon nabe was amazing! very savory with a light sweetness and very hot and filling on a cold night! Okonomiyaki was okay at best. My bf is a huge fan of okonomiyaki and this was made way to thick and wasn't very seasoned as well.   The service was also extremely attentive and friendly. The employees there were very helpful with suggestions (sometimes too helpful) and just very friendly to talk too.   I will def be back, and I wish they were closure to where I lived because its kinda of a drive to get here. Amazing sushi, prices are a little higher but its the best in a desert so its worth it!",

We ordered a little too much because everything looked so good, but that's more of a observation than a complaint. Definitely one of those places I'd recommend to others without hesitation.    Just a tip. If alcohol is your thing, bring your own, as they don't serve any. Didn't bother me though I'll just remember for next time.",

On a normal visit, we order edamame (warmed) to start, then order 4-5 rolls and 8-10 sashimi pieces. The fish is so fresh and tasty, you would think they caught the fish out back seconds before plating it for you.  The salmon is my favorite sashimi, but my sister in law would say her favorite is the uni.   It is also BYOB, so feel free to bring some beer, bottle of wine, or even champagne. They will keep it all on ice for you and make sure you are always filled up. Can't get much better, especially with sushi being so expensive.   I hear their noodle dishes are AMAZING too, but I can't stray away from the sushi - it's that good!  You will not regret it.... GO!",

Hana has the best sushi in AZ, hands down. The yellowtail sashimi is our favorite, because it melts in your mouth. But all the other sushi is really good, including the salmon and spicy tuna roll. The sashimi is so flavorful and definitely tastes fresh. The prices are a bit high, but that wasn't a dealbreaker for us since we know we're in Arizona, sushi comes at a price. The quality of fish here is definitely worth the price, though.  Tonkotsu Ramen is wonderful, as well. You have to order the egg on the side, but the pork and egg (if added) are cooked perfectly and the portions for the ramen is huge. It's a good, filling meal at a great price. Definitely recommended!",

There's something endearing to me about a sushi bar with no liquor license and no qualms about letting you bring a 6 pack in with you of whatever your little heart desires. Never been anywhere else similar to it, but I gotta be honest, I kinda dug it.  Anyhoo, Robert was kind enough to bring me here in early June upon hearing I had never been there before and boy was I glad he did! Of course I drove past the restaurant several times before realizing it was in a strip mall, but I forgave the drab exterior the second I arrived and saw a packed restaurant aflurry with wait staff flying around every corner attentively serving their patrons. I was late (shocker) and our waiter was there to grab my sake out of my hand to chill it before my butt fully hit the seat. I was impressed.  Next there was the fish. Holy fresh as the Pacific melt in your mouth fish! We shared the octopus salad which was pretty tasty considering I'm not a huge octopus fan (solely due to texture.) Next I had whatever the toro special of the day was which was freaking exquisite and Robert and I split a catepilar roll, also quite good.  All in all my Hana experience was more than satisfactory. My biggest complaint living in Phoenix is a lack of fresh fish and sushi on demand and that was certainly not the case with Hana. I could've gone for a little more variety and adventure with their signature sushi rolls, but I really can't complain. Quality was definitely up to par and I will be back.",

Ok, maybe it's a little light on the ambiance side, but they offer outdoor seating, the indoor area is above average for the non-ubertrendy sushi restaurant category, and they were festively decorated for Halloween, which is cool in my book.  After looking at the menu online, I was a little skeptical at all of the glowing reviews.  I'll give you a little secret: the best menu items are the specials that aren't on the menu!    The highlight of the meal was the Walu tataki - at around $20, it comes with maybe 8 thinly sliced, seared pieces.  Not cheap, but worth it because it's melt in your mouth delicious!  I would've ordered $100 of it but refrained so we could sample other things :)  Other standout items were the squid salad (not chewy at all) and the yellowtail sashimi (really fresh and a huge portion).  With some iced teas and a couple of rolls, the meal came to around $40 per person.  That's about normal for a sushi dinner, and we preferred our meal here to other top (Yelp) rated sushi restaurants, like Toyama.  Outside of Ra's Sunday night happy hour, this will probably become our go-to sushi spot :)",

I found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places, and the food to be of only moderate quality.  I did appreciate the authentic atmosphere, it was perfect for our date night.  However, my boyfriend and I found ourselves a little creeped out by our server who paced the small restaurant while we decided what we would order, and lingered near the table just a little bit too long every time he checked on us.   All in all, the food was decent, but overpriced, I will be sticking to Moto on 16th street and Glendale.",

    "text": "I'm a huge Japanese cuisine and Sushi connoisseur so I had to write a review after the amazing lunch today at Hana.  Hana is not your typical Japenese restaurant, it's the real deal and offers an extensive menu.  A few of the items we ordered were the Salmon & Albacore Sashimi and it was so fresh.  They provide both fresh and wasabi spread which is wonderful.  Their Albacore was truly some of the best I've ever had which was topped with browned scallions, and avocado slices. Hana is Japenese owned and operated restaurant which explains the attention to detail, as well as the amazing menu.  Rick, their Sushi chef prepared our sushi and it was beautifully prepared, as well incredibly fresh.  I also want to give a shout out to our waiter today, Jake, who took great care of us and did a really great job providing us with some really wonderful recommendations. It's alway so nice when the wait staff knows the menu.  I was also pleased to find out that Hana also offers BYOB, and even provides a wine bucket and glasses. I will have already recommended Hana to many of my friends and this will definitely be one of my regular places to eat.",

We ordered 4 different items (tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll and yasai yakisoba). Upon opening the tuna roll, I noticed that they looked very odd - much different than they normally look - the tuna was bloody and the juices were in the take out container. It was unappetizing and frankly disgusting. My daughter eats tuna rolls frequently and she ate 1 and refused to eat the rest saying they didn't taste good. My spicy tuna was bland, there was no very much spice to it at all and I am used to Hana's spicy tuna making my nose run. The shrimp tempura had no flavor once so ever - extremely bland. The yasai yakisoba was of someone else so I do not know how it was except that normally the box is full and the box wasn't even half full tonight. It is a pity that our dinners were so blah and uninspiring. We will no longer be patrons of this establishment.",

    "text": "There are so many things *right* with Hana that one can almost overlook the sordid quality and schmaltzy presentation of their sushi rolls.  Overriding every other concept of the restaurant is the fact that 95% of the hungry patrons at Hana are boozehounds like myself, and this place will cater to the unholy amounts of BYOB that each table will bring.  What is truly exceptional is that 1) No corkage fee 2) They will chill your white for you in an ice bucket at the table 3) If you bring beer, they will keep it in their fridge for you and bring you another as you continue to dine  4) everyone here relishes in this policy.  Seriously, I witnessed a table of 5 with 5 bottles of wine and a sixer of some imported swill.  You could eat a seaweed wrapped piece of Gypsy at this saturation point, and it would taste like toro.  So, my gf Melissa B and I get there around 6:30 on a Saturday loaded up with our Sav Blanc and six of Rogue Dead Guy Ale and with full intentions of waiting for a table due to the popularity of this restaurant and its 50 person max capacity.  Surprisingly, they had 3 tables open, all of them 4-tops.  The hostess informs us that the wait will be 20-25 mins and I'm thinking 'oh, cool, those tables must be reserved.  No worries.  Oh, and hey look!  There is a two top paying out'.  Well, after that couple leaves, they scoot over the two top to make it a six top and seat the aforementioned boozer-quintuplets who were rightfully there before us still waiting.  Okay.  No biggie, there are still open tables.  A party of three come in.  \"Hi!  There is no waiting\".    They get a seat  Another party of three stroll in.  Yep.  \"Hi!  There is no waiting\".    There goes our last chance of a seat for a while, and we're 25 mins into our wait.  Thank God I brought the beer.  As I understand it, they will only seat parties of two at their two tops [of which they had few, and one was being used as an impromptu wine rack for the wino-Salingers] or at the sushi bar.  I really have absolutely no problem with this policy, but I could see how it would piss some people off -- maybe from an older generation who feel slighted by shit like this, which is why I'm even discussing it.  But anyway, we eventually we got our perfect little two top and preceded to order edamame and miso.  These are two staple appetizers for any Japanese restaurant.  The edamame came out cold, which was okay, as it is typically served cooled .. but I actually prefer my edamame heated and the server never asked for a preference ... hell, they even ask you at throw-away joints like Ra.  Since we are a culture of benevolent Americans who are intent on skewing EVERY foreign dish, I always assume that the edamame will be served warm.  Either way, I was too timid to ask since these servers seem to be flying around the small restaurant with nary a second to spare at the microwave.  The miso soup was excellent ... but if I'm looking for shit to complain about, they served it with that damn goofy, oversized spoon.  When we got our boat of fish my gf and I commented that we would have liked a little extra prep time.  I mean come on, there needs to be distinct transitional times between courses.  We were only mildly impressed with the presentation.  The rolls were prepped very sloppily.  The yellowtail was absolutely lost in the rice.  The tempura shrimp was sliced so thin that it was destroyed by the chopstick.  The caterpillar roll had almost no essence of eel within.  The spicy tuna was good, but nothing to rave about as seems to be the trend when discussing Hana.  We also ordered the processed daikon off of their specials-board [which our server never went over BTW], and I would highly recommend staying away from this unless you curiously want to know what Little Lisa's Slurry from the Simpson's episode \"The Old Man and The Lisa\" might have tasted like.  Blech.  I'm sure it was downhome authentic, but Christ, THAT was vile.  Anyway, that was MY fault, not Hana's.  I will say that the first time that I came to Hana [with Graham C and Yelp's famous Jerry], it was absolutely phenomenal.  I think something has been lost in translation.  Back then, their rolls were much better prepared and the toro was otherworldly.  Perhaps it is the hulking Melrose virulence seeping into their foundation.  I will conclude with a statement about  how I am aware that Hana is going for authenticity; which makes the curt service, lack of formalities like \"hi! how is everyone today\" [I doubt they do that shit at sushi joints in Japan], and loud, bustling atmosphere work to a degree.  I can HOWEVER, see that being such a turn-off to those unwilling or unaware to put up with it, or worse yet, interpret it as rudeness.  I personally like the fact that places like Hana exist as an antithesis to garbage like Ra.  But every polarization needs an equilibrium, and for my money, time, and need for experience, nothing beats Sakana.",

    "text": "This review is the splitting image of Jekyll and Hyde: Hana when going for Sushi (specifically makizushi aka rolls--I'm not much for Nigiri or Sashimi) = 3 Stars. When going for Noodles = 5 stars.  Last night I went for sushi and I haven't for a really long time because I feel their sushi is quite pricey in comparison to other sushi 'rants and that there's less roll variety... less you brave the under described Specials Menu. Another annoying thing is that the sushi is BIG. In Japan, you are supposed to eat sushi whole, but when we ordered the Hana Roll (Their best standard roll, IMHO), I could cut it into two perfectly sized pieces--if nori was nicely cut-able so in the end it was a disaster on my plate and eaten piece-meal. I told the friend I was dining with that this is the sushi version of eating ribs on a first date... too messy (At times I had Avocado lipstick moments)... but I have to admit, all the contents of the roll were tasty and I liked their eel sauce consistency and proportions (sometimes it can be over slathered and/or runny, drenching the rice till it's rendered un-sticky and difficult to handle. Remember, traditionally, sushi was meant to be eaten by hand... the original Japanese, sandwich if you will. I did enjoy the way it was presented... on a boat with a little pyrotechnic touch.  Now on to the*real* good stuff... The Noodles... I WILL SAY THEY HAVE THE BEST RAMEN IN TOWN! My brother, who I describe as a carboholic eater, but more specifically a noodle-holic states it is his favorite in town hands down... and, so do I. It's the broth that does it. And you get SOOOOO much more when you get any of their noodle dishes. You get a starter salad in the best Miso dressing in town, according to my opinion... and, if you get any of the tempura options, you get the SAME amount of tempura you would get as an appetizer order for $6.95--In Hawaii, you usually only get 1-2 pieces of ebi tempura--to dredge in your bowl of noodles! (Note, the bowl of Tempura Soba is $9.25). It is so hard for me to NOT get this meal because it's warm and comforting for a girl from the islands, and it's own little 3 course meal for one low price! Hard to beat, but I do struggle when ordering because their Yakibuta Ramen (Japanese BBQ pork w/ egg noodles) is also SO good. I've tried to make the pork at home, but it doesn't come out nearly as soft and tasty as theirs... it's heaven! (Good thing you can order it as an appetizer!) The ONLY thing that remotely upsets me about the Noodle portion of Hana's menu is the no substitution clause, which is understandable--the chef wants the noodles to be prepared as they are, but oh would I for once want to change the Soba noodles into Ramen Noodles and add the Yakibuta slices into my bowl that already has Tempura in it! Sometimes a girl just wants it all, all, all, ALL!  Now on to the peripherals... There appetizer menu is quite broad... I'm hoping to try the oysters and mussels one day... The Agedashi Tofu is piping hot and tasty with the katsuobushi (fish flakes) that move in dramatic ways as the heat rises from the tofu... sort of eye-boggling and entrancing! And don't forget the Miso, Octopus, Squid Salads, Yakibuta and \"Varietous\" Tempura plate... all YUMS UP for me! (It was fun haggling with my friend for the veggies we wanted. I got the Shiso Leaf and he felt he got the better deal acquiring the mushroom).   Their Bento Box meals are also a great price for the variety of meal you get, and I'll admit, I would buy their Chicken Katsu if I was jonesin' for it but was too lazy to cook it myself.  Lastly dessert... I've only been up for it once (Usually too full from apps or already equipped with desire to cross the road and put my Mary Coyle's Ice Cream cravings to rest), but last night, we went all out and tried the Tempura Ice Cream... of which I was surprised it was Tempura MOCHI Ice Cream... I was just expecting a crunch and then ice cream... instead I found some surprise \"Gumption\" between the two and it made the experience one with strange faces and long tastings and thoughts racing in my head contemplating whether I liked it or not... too long a ponder = the answer: not so much. Nice attempt, but I'd say stick to the subtlety of the Mochi Ice Cream experience!  Oh! Almost forgot about service! I must agree with other Yelpers in their spottiness but there is one waiter who has always made a good impression on me. Last night he served us our Ice Cream and since it came with 3 pieces he made a gesture to grab a chair and come join us for the 3rd piece. Another time, he and I enjoyed raving about the awesomeness of the Yakibuta. I also like that he reminds me of those Japanese \"cool kids\" hanging out in Harajuku.  So, all in all, a very roller coaster ride through the land of Hana (Flowers). Definite reasons to come back and definite reasons to steer clear. Just depends on what you're in the mood for. Noodles YES, Makizushi, not so much.",

We arrived about 6:30pm and were seated after only a few minute wait.  Our waiter was Nick and he was both helpful and dead on with his recommendations.   I had forgotten that it was BYOB so the waiter quickly directed me to a liquor store across the street...nice  We pretty much left the ordering up to him and here is what we had.   Toro Tataki....basically a loin of toro rolled in seasoning, seared and sliced thin. Awesome.   We followed that with a special call Lil Dino....was a roll w Shrimp inside, thinly sliced scallop on top and a spicy sauce on top of that and then quickly baked...Unbelievable.   Next, we had a few pieces of sushi.... giant mackerel and red snapper. Both had great flavor and texture...fresh, sweet and soft as butter!  Fresh Grilled Squid w Ginger Soy Sauce....need I say more? Yum  We usually pass on dessert but figured we should try one more thing since everything had been awesome!    Wasabi Vanilla Ice Cream....tasted like it sounded and with fresh wasabi on top, we could spice it up even more.   Overall, this place rocks....we will absolutely get back there before long.   (maybe even try the Shabu Shabu they have on Sundays!)  Go, let the wait staff guide you and enjoy!",

I'm sashimi all the way - no rice to muss things up, and no desire for most of the cooked stuff - so my rating is really based on the fish experience. And the salmon skin - excellent rolls and hand rolls. I have found few, if any places in the valley with as good selection and quality of fish. Prices are certainly not cheap, but the if you are all about plain slices of raw fish, it's is way better than the cheaper places.",

    "text": "The best thing about Hana is that it is in my neighborhood. The worst thing about Hana was that I didn't enjoy the experience and I wanted to! The waiting staff was milling about the door area, ignoring people. I dislike when staff has people to greet but they are busy chatting about their social calendars or whatnot with their backs to the customers. However the chef's behind the counter greeted us very happily. The energy was such that I began thinking, \"Hey, this is exactly what I was looking for! Hooray!\" After we were seated other people came in and got like a group greeting. Maybe they are regulars. It would be annoying to group greet every single customer. There were two waitstaff running about like crazy chickens doing all the work. I was sort of curious about that, what was the point of having so many people \"on\" that weren't actively working the tables? We got one of the rushed servers and she spoke so fast we had trouble understanding her. We let her know we were new and would need some time to acclimate to the selections, but we didn't get a break about becoming familiar with what was offered and ended ordering hurriedly. As a result we didn't end up trying as many things as we might have. It's not good to rush people who are planning to explore a menu. I mean we can really spend some serious money on sushi if given half a chance. Despite the fast ordering, it was slow in being made. The chef  seemed busy making boats, so I was ok with waiting... for awhile. Then I just got rumbly and flagged down the server who was at that time actually bringing out my Endamame. Maybe I was impatient? The Endamame wasn't salted and they were cool. Not sure if that's the style for here, but I prefer hot and salted shells that pop open with light pressure. Not these. However it was a good thing I had them, because my wait continued and it would have been intolerable if it hadn't been for the pods. I was determined to be impressed with the fresh fish I read about and was hoping that we'd found a place close to home for happy sushi time. The octopus was not fresh. It was dry and very rubbery. The other fish was decent but there was too much of a fish smell, another warning to me. The  rice didn't hold either. Sloppy or collapsing sushi rolls always annoy me and then if I determine the fish isn't the best, I'm pretty much done. It was ok, but I truly expected it to wow me. I think we came at a bad time. It was dinner, but they weren't packed to the gills. The chef really wanted us to be happy it seemed, he did continually smile and nod our way.  My partner did not let me see the bill. Apparently for what we ordered it was much higher than I would have liked. They always do that if they think I am going to feel upset about the cost/value ratio.  We paid, we left, it's not going on our regular rotation.  We might try it again, because there are an awful lot of good reviews here and it is really close to home, but so far when I've brought it up my partner I hear, \"I don't think so\" and \"you have a really poor memory don't you?\" I do my best to recall the happy sushi chef and think... maybe if I came on a good night he would make stronger sushi rolls and the fish would be just delivered and maybe my whole experience would be speical and I'd be thrilled to have Hana right nearby.  As it is Hana gets Two stars= Meh. I've experienced better.",

Small, out of the way and right across the street from Channel 3's station...What a gem!  The staff are extremely friendly and hilarious...Jokes are thrown about like so much fish  at the Pike Place Market.  Sarcasm so thick you could cut it with a knife.   First things first..... Food:  When any food comes out on a wooden boat, you already get bonus points, but when the food is excellent, it's even better.  We ordered the volcano, spicy tuna, Vegas, Hana peche, and caterpillar rolls and were amazed at their freshness and speed.  Kudos to the boat with a flame! BYOB:  Bring what you want and they refrigerate the rest...No more complaining about drink selection: bring or shut up! 5 stars for ambiance, personality and a waiter who doesn't mind a mint being thrown at him!!!!",

Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.  the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.  our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house.   I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.",

I love the old school boats for serving the sushi.  My favorite option was the spicy tuna roll, which was actually spicy and not slathered in mayo like most sushi bars in town.  It's BYOB, and they don't have a corkage fee.  I'll definitely be going back!",

Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.",

Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad ( so it should have been hard to screw up, right?).  The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasn't bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid $8.00 for something I couldn't eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad.  We ended up throwing everything out. It's obvious our first time will be our last.",

So bring your own sake, wine or whatever you want to drink. Just don't bring any hard liquor which isn't allowed. I learned this when I came to celebrate my dad's birthday and as a gift, we gave him a bottle of Johnny Walker blue. And we were told hard liquor isn't allowed. But hey, imma wine drinker anyways.   I always start w the gyoza and shishito peppers. My husband usually gets the habachi steak & shrimp which comes w a ribeye n shrimp pan seared w garlic, butter n lemon. Very Benihana style.  I on the other hand can't get enough of their sushi!!! So fresh! I highly recommend their sushi boat. It does not disappoint!! If you're into rolls then I usually get he Hana roll and lobster roll!!",

It's rare that I find an establishment that I have dined at that really blew my mind in so many ways.   Hana is so much more than just a sushi restaurant. It is a place where you can find Japanese Kaiseki dining, there is as much love in the Tempura as there is in the uni and oyster shooter. There is no fluff or fuss over the food here, just super high quality ingredients that have been perfectly balanced the way that the ingredients are meant to be enjoyed. Simple flavors, quality ingredients and lots of love and passion in the kitchen.   Japanese cuisine and culture is something that I have always found intriguing. I had the opportunity to chat with one of the owners while there... I really enjoyed hearing about her passion for the restaurant, her travels to Japan and learning more about the amazing chefs that work at Hana.   I can't wait to come back to Hana, enjoy more of their delicious food. This place lives up to the hype.... Believe it!",

It's a small, cozy restaurant with tables for 3-4, for 2, and seats at the sushi bar. We ordered the vegetarian gyoza as our appetizer and two cups of miso soup. We also got the Philly roll and Las Vegas roll, and the former came out first out of all the food. I love a classic Philly roll, can't go wrong with cream cheese and salmon. The Vegas roll was okay, I'm just not a fan of the deep fried rolls. The soup was excellent, simple but satisfying. And the appetizer was pretty good as well. They brought us more pickled ginger when we asked, since we like that stuff a lot.   Good service, they are fast and efficient at refilling water and clearing off empty plates. Partly because the place is so small and they were getting more customers. Once we paid our bill, we felt that we had to leave because groups of two were waiting and there were no empty tables for 2. Still a great place to check out and I liked the authentic feel of it.",

We had high hopes for Hana after hearing many great reviews for their sushi. Unfortunately, we left the restaurant feeling like we paid way too much for the quality of food and service.   For our appetizer, we ordered the pork gyoza. The order of gyoza came with only five pieces for $8. That's a little pricey for gyoza AND it was very bland. The pork gyoza at Trader Joe's is much tastier than this.   We ordered the Alaskan Roll, Baked Alaskan, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll. The sushi was good, but definitely was not worth the price. The sushi rolls were about $10 each. With that being said, we've had better rolls with nicer prices else where.   My boyfriend ordered the Maguro Teriyaki, which comes with miso soup, side salad, and rice. It was just okay and didn't look as good as it sounds. He also didn't receive his salad with the meal. It was not worth the $20 pricing.   The service was okay, but definitely could have been better.  Overall, the quality of food, pricing, and service were mediocre and disappointing. Definitely over priced!",

I had a girls dinner planned for a Thursday night with two friends, and as usual, we started throwing around ideas about where to meet a day or two before.  One friend wanted Italian, and another said sushi sounded good.  I'm always game for sushi, so I suggested we try Hana.  After all, I had bookmarked it on Yelp years ago, but for some reason, I still had not been.   I was the first to arrive at around 7:20, and the place was packed with a few people waiting to be seated.  I checked in with Jake, who was super friendly and he said it would be about a 15 minute wait.  He was spot on.  There was confusion with on of my girlfriends about the location -- (likely my fault) -- she was heading toward the Hana Sushi up north on Union Hills and 7th Ave when I reached her to clarify.  (No relation between those restaurants by the way).    Once that was cleared up, our party of three was seated in a timely manner and greeted warmly by Hannah, our adorable server.  Not only did she know her stuff, giving us detailed answers to our questions about many of the items on the menu, but she was friendly and made sure to find out if we had any allergies, etc... Service overall couldn't have been more attentive!  We ordered a variety of appetizers including seaweed salad, miso eggplant, and vegetable dumplings.  We also had the special Toro Sashimi for the table (which was incredible by the way), and a handful of rolls and nigiri.  Some of my faves were the Hana Pecha Roll, the Hotate and Ikura nigiri, and the Tuna Tataki roll.  I didn't have a bad bite that evening.  Everything was fresh, tasty, and no doubt high quality.  The homemade wasabi is pretty remarkable as well, adding just the right kick and flavor to each bite.  I'm not sure why it took so long for me to get to this local gem, but now that I've been, I plan on returning again and again.  There are plenty of other options on the menu that I am already thinking about ordering next time, and I'll be sure to BMOB on future visits too!  Looking forward to it already!",

Turn out $25 buys 4 pieces of bite sized, deep fried red snapper, not toro, not sea urchin. I understand red snapper can be high priced but after deep fried and sauced it taste like tilapia.   I rarely return a dish but when the waitress offered I did it. Just to find out they still charge the portion you ate. At that point I was just deeply annoyed, paid 30% of the dish cause I had one bite plus tips and left.   I can't comment on any other dish but I feel cheated and will not go back again.",

    "text": "This is my third review of Hana, and it just keeps getting better and better. The food at Hana is top notch. From the appetizers to the sushi, to the kitchen specials, every single dish at Hana is carefully made and thought out.   We always start out with the poki chips which I am honestly obsessed with. It is a simple dish made up of green onions, cucumber, imitation crab and mildy spicy seasoning (Shichimi Togarashi) served with fried wonton chips. Theres something about this dish that leaves you wanting more. If you sit at the bar, they give you a small complimentary dish. The calamari (ika kara age) is also a simple dish, which does not come with a dipping sauce. There's really no need as the breading is tasty and crispy - the side of lemons should suffice. The seaweed salad is great, and has a lot of depth.   For the kitchen specials, you can't go wrong with the salmon dish which I usually get with teriyaki sauce. It's delicious and the salmon is cooked perfectly. One of my favorite dishes is the gyudon nabe. This is the best gyudon I've ever had. I'm not used to gyudon coming in an almost sukiyaki-like dish with the broth and all but I enjoyed this one a lot. I believe they use ribeye for the meat which they marinate. The meat is fatty, tasty and tender. The broth is absolutely amazing. Everything about this dish is perfect. It comes with a side of rice. Ive had the hamachi kama and the zaruten soba which have both been excellent. As far as the ramen goes, I'm not a huge fan. This is the only dish that I think has some room for improvement.  The fish at Hana is always fresh. I'm fairly simple and just always go with the spicy salmon roll/ hand roll. I love that they use whole chunks of salmon. My only complaint is the lack of consistency. Spicy salmon roll is not on their menu and everytime I order it, I get a different dish. Sometimes they top it with green onions and include cucumber in the roll and sometimes it's just plain salmon. It's good regardless but pretty inconsistent.  The service is good most of the time but it can get inconsistent as well. I do sometimes feel like I'm being rushed when I'm dining. Hana is definitely overpriced and prepare to spend more than your budget. However, the food is absolutely SPECTACULAR. Hana is definitely one of the top restaurants on my list.",

    "text": "Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5 Ambience: 3/5  So the food is better than most sushi restaurants in Arizona. Definitely not comparable to sushi outside of AZ so I won't use that as a comparison tool. We ordered a variety of items from the menu including pieces of yellow tail, shrimp, snow crab, and tuna. We ordered Hana mint leaf, dynamite roll, deep fried oysters, spider roll, miso soup, and their special Hana dessert. Everything was fine except for the Hana mint leaf which consisted of cooked uni?? It's not appetizing haha.  Service was meehh because we ordered a couple appetizers and entrees right? But we first received the dynamite roll and the appetizer came out as like the 4th thing. Our dishes just came out haphazardly and the waitress (who I think is one of the owners) acted as if this was totally normal everything was fine no need to apologize or explain sort of deal. The kicker was when there was a lull in food coming to us so we thought we were done and we knew we had another dish that hadn't come out but we figured they had forgotten because that was an appetizer as well and it had been so long ago since our first order came out. Even the waitress came with dessert menus to our table asking what we'd like to order and we put in the hana dessert. AND THEN one of the chefs comes with our supposedly forgotten appetizer and my friend and I look at each other like what are we supposed to do with that? The waitress explains that that dish with scallops takes a long time to make and just leaves it at that. No apology. Just gives us a blank stare and stands there like, y'all should eat it because it came out now even though your dessert will out shortly. So we said we didn't want it.  The restaurant is fairly small. There are maybe a handful of 4 seat tables and a handful of 2 person tables and then there are seats in front of the chefs. When we went on a Tuesday ~7:30pm there was no wait and we were seated immediately.  Things to note: They don't take reservations and don't serve alcohol. They're closed on Mondays and holidays!",

    "text": "Killer, fresh and responsibly priced - is how I used describe Hana many years ago, when it was hard to find a True reflection solid sushi/sashimi joint.  I spearfish/fish as a hobby....a lot. I live in Miami and my front porch is the ocean.   Sadly, Hana lost it's soul. It's morphed to become another common run of the mill middle-America tragedy.  Overpriced, low quality and sadly the service has dropped off the face of the planet.  If you're a True fresh sushi/sashimi lover, I would skip the hype and save your money for lunch at Chula in Scottsdale..... Unless you're into an American version of dynamite rolls packed with mayo and siracha, several layers of rice, completely lacking any raw fish flavors of the sea....WAIT...still don't waste your time. Head to your nearest grocery store and buy the pre-made boxes of manufactured scraps stacked in the grab-n-go fridge.   Sorry for the candid review, but when I lived in the Valley many years ago I was a regular, raved about the place and it sucks when restaurants conform and transform to fake versions of their original authenticity. Also, disappointed in New Times pallette and recent positive reviews. They themselves have been stuck in the desert too long.   People appreciate True love and real food. I know buying power is tough when you only have one restaurant, but reach out to Chula, they sell amazing fresh fish. Get back in touch with your roots. Amazing fresh fish - reasonably priced.",

Granted I didn't ask how much the pieces of Toro tuna would end up being, but at $20 and $40 for two (?$)  pieces - that was stupid. Without even seeing the bill, I didn't even eat very much. My fault, I should have asked. BUT, the restaurant is really just an old dirty looking  bar with cheap, cheap tables and the tables are very tight together. There is an overflow room next door with stupid folding type tables and cheap chairs. Zero ambience and it's just really an overflow room that does not even match the attempted dark bar scene next door. If I was going to spend that much in sushi or sashimi - it should be a step up!

My husband and I ordered the vegetable tempura, pork gyoza, salmon, halibut, and squid sushi, and two rolls; dyno roll and the Las Vegas roll. The tempura was crispy and yummy, the gyoza were extremely bland and flavorless, the frozen ones at Trader Joe's tastes better.  Salmon and halibut were delish, just cut very sloppy. The squid sushi was possibly steamed? A bit chewy but not bad. The Las Vegas roll is to heavy for my taste but my husband liked it. The dyno roll.. I don't even know what that things was. A typical roll, baked, with fish and maybe a mayo cheese sauce on top? It was weird textures and tastes all mixed together.  All of that came to $83. I think it would definitely be worth it if the quality and flavors were there, but way to expensive for what it was.",

    "text": "just came back from having dinner here. first time visiting phoenix, and my family was looking for a nearby sushi place near our hotel. we're originally from vancouver, canada, where we have some of the best sushi/sashimi in north america. one of the items we ordered was the toro sashimi (6 pieces an order) which did not have a listed price. the other prices on the sashimi menu were average, with the most expensive being $20. when we got the bill, the 6 pieces of toro came out to be $40 before tax. this is at an average sushi restaurant, with most of the menu items costing $10-$20. i would understand if i had to pay this much at a fine dining sushi restauarant or at a place with a $$$ or $$$$ rating.. but seriously? i don't mind paying the extra money for something i know that's going to be worth it. felt like being robbed. i've had the freshest toro for less than half the cost. if you're going to put something on the menu that's skyrocketing high compared to the other items under the same category, maybe you should tell your servers to explain it to the customers. in the manager's defense, he said they fly fresh bluefin tuna from japan overnight and that it costs him 1000s of dollars. if you're spending that much money on your fish and you say your toro meat is that special, why aren't you advertising that to your customers? instead, you decide to keep the price off the menu and keep your servers quiet. totally unreasonable.   edit after looking at their website: \" Doesn't all Sushi Grade Fish Come from Japan? The short answer is no. We buy fish based on taste and freshness, and based on feedback from our customers, we've been buying a lot of fish from Hawaii when available.  The only fish we've sourced from Japan in the recent past is yellowtail, toro, tuna and mackeral.  As soon as the Japan earthquake struck, we immediately made a big purchase of these fish, which were fished and flash frozen before the earthquake.  We have not purchased any fish from the Japan region since that time, and all remaining stock in the restaurant of those fish is either sourced from other locations, or was fished and flash frozen before the earthquake, meaning there is absolutely no risk at all of radiation.\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME fukushima accident was in 2011 so what are you saying you're selling frozen tuna from 2011  or are you lying to everyone's face or you haven't updated your website for years my god",

The portion was large and with the other food beforehand I was unable to finish the entire bowl. The waitress was very helpful and friendly as well.

    "text": "Have brought a few people here as I love their sushi. I don't go as much as I want because I know there is going to be a wait for one of the 6 tables that they have inside this tiny place unless you get there by 430pm for dinner. I sat outside once but it was freezing but much better to have a conversation since it's so loud inside. Love the way they present the food because that is part of the dining experience right? Plates comes out with flames all over them. Never had a bad sushi buuuuuuuutttt one waitress on a visit asked me if I wanted the special, which was off the menu. She proceeded to write it out on paper as to be discreet. The special was whale.  I looked at her like \"You obviously do not know about the Australian Sea Shepherds!\"  So much for claims of scientific whaling and no, I didn't get the special off-menu item.",

    "text": "I had a craving for sushi and a friend who wanted to try this place because a friend of his is a chef here.  It was the perfect combination!  Since it was a Friday night I suggested we get there early-ish to try and get a table quickly so we arrived around 5:30.  The place is pretty small so most of the tables were full but we managed to get seated right away.  My friend decided that he was going to order everything  so I knew dinner was definitely not going to be some Philly rolls and fried rice.  We started out with seaweed salad which I actually really liked.  The flavor was really good with the sesame seeds and some lemon.  Next was the sushi, we had the Alaskan roll, Spicy Tuna, Volcano roll and some Sea Bass nigiri.  The Alaskan and Spicy Tuna were good, the Volcano roll was awesome with it's spicy sauce nicely crusted on top and the Sea Bass was simple and delicious.  After that it was time for me to try Oysters for the first time.  Personally I wasn't a big fan but that has nothing to do with Hana and everything to do with just my personal preference.  I could tell the quality was good and they didn't taste gross, I just discovered that Oysters aren't my thing.  Now at this point we were pretty full but the chef my friend knew walked by and told him to get the Razor Clams and/or the Tako Karaage.  Neither of us knew what the second one was so we asked and discovered it was fried octopus head.  As soon as he told us that I knew that's what my friend was going to order.  I'll admit I was a little nervous because I was picturing something with eyeballs coming out onto the table.  Luckily when they brought it to the table it was cut into strips so it looked completely harmless.  We drizzled some lemon over it, took a deep breath and took a bite.  After about 2 seconds we looked at each other in amazement because it was DELICIOUS!!!  I'm talking so good my mouth is watering just remembering it right now.  Octopus has a tendency to get chewy but this had a texture like steak!  The flavor of it was amazing as well.  The lemon juice gave it just the right balance of citrus and whatever they marinated it in before frying it was perfect.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  For desert we asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hana An Mitsu which is aloe vera with fruit and red bean paste.  I wasn't quite sure about eating aloe vera as I associate it with putting it on my skin for a sun burn but we decided to continue our adventure of trying new things and get it.  It came out almost like a soup, there were big chunks of the aloe, a couple strawberries, some mandarin oranges and the chunky red bean paste all in a liquid of some kind.  Neither of us were really big fans, the aloe chunks were just too big and overpowered the rest of it.  Overall though the meal was one of the best I've had.  The quality and flavors of the food was excellent.",

Sometimes you forget how REALLY fresh fish tastes because you live in the desert. Hana will remind you.  It's pricier than some other places, but their menu is extensive and their specials are always changing. Expect about $20-30+ a person, unless you order off the lunch/dinner menu only... but why go to a sushi bar without ordering said specialty.",

    "text": "Bizarre. My family of 5 came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them.   Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.  And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was \"so do you want it?\" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.  The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the \"crab\" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still.   The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles.   Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.",

They don't seem to do that anymore, at least not with the smaller orders.  I kinda miss that.  Maybe they don't have enough boats or something.  ;)",

    "text": "What a disappointment!  After such glowing Yelps, maybe I was expecting too much.  I have to qualify the review by saying that the only thing we ordered from the regular menu was gyoza.  Those were fair, but could have passed for the frozen kind you get from the Asian grocery and pan fry yourself.  As for the sushi: both rolls and nigiri were covered with a thick layer of scallions.  If the quality of the fish it good, there's really no need for embellishment.  The fish itself didn't taste fishy or old, but it lacked any flavor at all, subtle or otherwise.  It had a high water content that made it seem like it might have been (gasp) recently defrosted.  This was backed up by the temperature...much too cold.  The sushi rice (yes, it makes a big difference) was a dense and glutinous mass.  You shouldn't have to chew rice that long to get it down your throat.    I gave two stars: one because it wasn't that there was anything  there to actually make you sick; it just wasn't what sushi is supposed to be, never mind what it can be when done right.  And two because the atmosphere was neighborhoody and casual, not trendy.  the waitstaff was really friendly, so much so we tried to justify the place to each other at first (a la maybe they were having a bad day, or maybe the next piece of sushi will be better) but no luck.   The search continues.",

They will be happy to chill your beer and bring out a cooler for the table to your wine or sake. Super nice! Food was excellent too.

They always remember my GF BF and I and make amazing accommodations for his wheat allergy! Plus, it is a BYOB with no corkage which always makes everything better!  Next, the fish is by far the freshest in the valley! It absolutely just melts in your mouth and the portion sizes are perfect! If you sit at a table, you also have your sushi served in a boat...who doesn't love a boat?!? Also, the rice is a very good stickiness and always cooked to perfection!  My GF BF and I have also ventured off the sushi menu and tried their shabu shabu (swish swish) Sunday night special and the most amazing Asian dish I have ever had called Gyu Don Nabe (it's on the kitchen specials board). Simply amazing!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  It's not a huge place so be prepared to wait sometimes, but it is completely worth it!! Can't wait to get my fix again!",

I guess I'm a little late to find this place but thanks to my friend Brian who loves to try out new places as much as I do (next up, BreadFruit) we went to Hana today for lunch.  I was impressed.  After my less than stellar experience with Tottie's earlier this week I still had a major hankering for some raw fish...Hana to the rescue!  I had no idea about the small space and the lunch rush but thankfully we got there right around noon and were able to walk right up to the sushi bar and sit down.  After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef (didn't get his name) we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try.  Within a minute, we were handed this interesting appetizer of a few tortilla chips with a yummy crab salad with a rice vinegar tasting base.  It reminded me of squid salad - either way, it was on the house and was very tasty.  Our first roll came out very quickly and was followed by a bowl of pickled wasabi to try with the sushi.  I have eaten at MANY sushi restaurants, but have never been given this.  Yum!  Placed on top of the sushi it is very good, definitely try it.  We went through each of the rolls - the Alaska was very good, the salmon nigiri was amazing, literally so fresh it melted in my mouth.  The Vegas roll and the Dynamite roll were great as well.    As we are finishing, the sushi chef starts talking to us about Giant Clam.  Neither of us had seen a Giant clam before, so he pulled it out and starts showing us how it splashed you with salt water that comes out of its mouth.  I thought it was very interesting, I'm not sure if the lady next to me did because she got salt water on her.  My friend and I had to take a picture because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen but like something I have definitely seen, all at the same time.  Its a little scary, I'm not going to lie.  In fact, it looks slightly like something from a 70s porn movie.  That's just what I've heard, not that I've ever seen a 70s porn, I mean, what kind of a girl do you think I am? Gosh!  I took a picture on my phone so I will post it here for those of you who have never seen one.  Overall, I had a good experience.  As someone said earlier, the food tastes so much better when the sushi chef is smiling and enjoying himself.  It was just fast enough for a lunch hour, just enough food, and just enough fun.   However, it did get very busy after we arrived and there was a wait when we left.  I would recommend getting there early to avoid the rush.   Oh, and if you're adventurous, apparently that scary looking giant clam is delicious when sauteed :)  I will let one of you try it first and let me know what you think.  I'm not that brave yet.",

So good, in fact, that each bite makes the lucky biter pause and savor.   I almost died without their salmon and tuna nigiri when I was preggers. (And maybe I snuck a piece or two, but don't tell.)  2.  Fantastic Japanese dishes rare enough that you won't find them in other sushi restaurants. Be daring and explore uncommon foods off their specials board. I've never been grossed out, only happily wowed, even when a whole fish, with skin on, arrived in front of us on one occasion. Seriously, it was great.  3. REAL wasabi if you ask for it. (Did you know that paste is not wasabi's natural state when observed in the wild?)  4.  BYOB.  It's fun!  BYOS (sake) for even more fun.  5.  Great atmosphere: Not a hole-in-the-wall, yet not so trendy that they blare the club jamz and that the waitresses are all augmented.  6.  Locally owned.  7.  Attentive service! Sometimes sassy service!  Go there! Eat fish!",

I really liked the food, I thought everything we tried was fresh and tasty.  It was served on a big wooden boat.   Tempura was average and nothing special.  I liked seeing the sushi chef and his helper making the food. He was smiling the entire time we were here, and in some small way I think it made the food taste better.  The service was all over the place, sometime they were all over us, and other times we had to flag them down.  A True hidden gem that's a thousand times better than a \"RA\" style sushi joint.",

They were GREAT. 2) Next we tried the Lobster Roll Special.  Awesome.  A huge roll with a giant piece of lobster on each piece. 3) Moving on to the Dynamite Roll...OMG (you have to say it like a 16 year when she gets the keys to daddy's BMW.)  This was the highlight.  It hardly qualifies as Sushi.  A giant steaming pile of crab, scallops, cheese, and sauces over some type of roll.  Wow.  Our server was EXCELLENT when he was around.  He spent  a considerable amount of time explaining several of the specials. He was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever had.  To be honest, the only negative of our experience was that he only stopped by our table three times in just over an hour...ouch.  If it weren't for having to flag him down to order or get our check, I would have given Hana 5 Stars.  I love the fact that they are BYOB.  This is a huge plus.  Give this place a shot. I will definitely be back...many times.  GREAT FIND.",

Foods; Pretty much every slice of sashimi was stringy even though it's called toro and very uneven surface - for Salmon, Halibut, and Tuna? maybe dull sashimi knife?!  Yellowtail taste good but the sushi looking was not that appetizing Oysters were way too big and over priced  Service was decent and attentive.. nothing super attractive or fascinating..  I'm not really motivated to drive back to this place anymore, so my final verdict of this place is \"Meh\"",

This is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now.  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own sake, wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in).    Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi, always fabulous specials on the board, and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi.    Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent, this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes.    Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi, even if it isn't on the short menu.  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available.  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here.  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world.  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good.   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available, amazing flavor and texture, very japanese.  mmmm.  Not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday, closed on Mondays.  Regular hours through the week.",

Give me that, the shrimp tempura roll, and I'm set! My husband always likes starting off with the edamame, but here's a head's up - If you like your edamame warm, ask them to heat it. Otherwise they will serve it cold, which is apparently the traditional (unAmericanized) way to eat it.   Hana is byob and they don't charge an uncorking fee. This is truly unbelievable to me and I hope they don't change that policy any time soon. This makes date night SUPER affordable in addition to being yummy!   The only downside is dependent on the crowd. If it's busy and you happen to go when there are larger parties, it can get really loud. If there aren't lot of larger parties, it's no louder than any other restaurant. Otherwise, the decor and simple, the ambiance is relaxed, and it's got a great vibe.",

    "text": "Based on all the yelp reviews, my Mesa friend and I came here for dinner tonight.  It was a fantastic choice.  Our waiter was super nice and super quick.  The atmosphere was dim and cozy.  Definitely would not recommend this for a big group though, it would be a bit cramped.    Here's what we ordered:  1.) Ika Kara Age (Sweet butter marinated squid breaded to a crunchy finish)  -  This dish was DELICIOUS, the squid was cooked just right! It wasn't chewy, rubbery or overcooked. It was tender, just enough flavor ...and many pieces in one order!  2.)  Agadashi Tofu (Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito)  -  This dish was a little bland, you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor...the majority of the flavor would be in the sauce. But no.  We had to sprinkle salt into the sauce ..which then made it better.  3.)  Umi No Sachi  (A sashimi salad)  -  A bed of mixed greens, HUGE chunks of sashimi all drizzled with a creamy white sauce.  This was the highlight of our dinner. I've never seen a sashimi salad for $16 that had this much sashimi that was so fresh, cut into such big slices before.  I absolutely give this dish 5stars!!!!!!!  You HAVE TO try this.  4.) Alaskan Roll -  A california roll wrapped with raw salmon.  You think, what's so special right? There must have been a secret sauce they put inside this roll because you got this amazing after taste...that just made you want to take another piece and another piece....and another piece...  5.)  Philadelphia Roll  -  A roll with cream cheese and salmon.  This was average, nothing significant but i was happy.  6.) Spicy Tuna Roll -  REALLY good spicy tuna roll, made me regret not ordering a spicy tuna hand roll....i bet that would have been orgasmic.    All the more reason to revisit!!    :)",

There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public).

The first time I was here, I was blown away by how different the sushi was and how they had things no other sushi bars seemed to have in Arizona.  The next 3 times I went back, Sunday, Sunday, and Friday back to back, I've been noticing things that I did not notice the first time.  First, I would like to say that I believe that a waiter/waitress should not wear cologne/perfume.  I did not notice it the first time I went, but every other time, I noticed the guy bringing the sushi literally bathes in the stuff.  I'm about to eat a bite out of my 10$ per serving of Monkfish liver and catching a big wiff of [insert popular brand of men's cologne here] is not appetizing.  Especially since smell is so heavily associated with taste.  A very big faux pas in my book.  After the great experience the first time, a few months later, I went 3 times in a row... back to back Sundays and Friday, I was able to notice that their specials didn't change in that time frame.  The chef's-here's-a-little-something-extra-you-didn't-order was the exact same also.  Maybe it's just me but I know a lot of places change their specials at least once a week.  How is the special still fresh if I see it every time I go?  I know the special is still there because they have not sold it out yet.  You know?  Also, their tempura is really sub-par in my book.  I know it's pretty hard to not have good shrimp tempura, but it's really blah. I've been able to taste it every single time I went there (it comes out as a side to a lot of noodle dishes such as udon and soba) but it tastes really floury and oily, and it's pretty heavy, batter-wise.  Shrimp tempura should be very light, almost an airy crisp, but not here.  My fellow diners were all in surprised agreement their tempura really was pretty blah.  Also, if you really like the tempura sauce other places have; the warm savory dipping broth other places have with grated daikon radish, don't expect it here.  You gotta use your soy sauce.  :(  Their cold soba noodles are very salty.  I've had to ask for a glass of ice and literally had to use the entire cup to dilute it enough to tolerate the saltiness.    The praises of this place come from the type of sushi you cannot find elsewhere.  I love the saba here, which is Mackerel.  Other places usually take the easy route and marinate it in the pickled ginger juice or their own vinegar marinade, but this place really serves the raw stuff.  Very good.  A must try in my book.    Sometimes Hana has monkfish liver, which is hard to find elsewhere.  It's better than uni (Sea urchin gonads) and literally the foie gras of the sea.  Very similar in texture and taste.  Mmmm... So good!!!  Better than the average sushi bar, but a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way and therefore brought my rating down to 3 stars.",

However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching.

    "text": "Some great things about Hana:  * A nicely put together sushi bar that has all the markings of become a big favorite amongst Phoenicians, without being scene-y or plasticky trendoid like several other sushi places in Phoenix and Scottsdale. It truly feels like a neighborhood gem. A sushi Cheers, if you will  * Mr. Sushi Rock Star (TM Curtis) was definitely on his game today. Hamachi and spicy tuna rolls didn't only taste excellent, with awesome quality fish, but they were A+ in presentation, too. Even though this was only lunch. On 7th Ave. And blocks away from a middle of the road Target. Mr. Sushi Rock Star is a jovial guy and more than happy to explain anything he's making or even to suggest new items to customers. The folks sitting at the bar definitely looked like they were getting treat after treat, including 4 rolls of different colored fish eggs in each.  * The chicken bento was excellent and the portions of chicken very generous. I also tried a few new things in their side sections - some desserty kind of items that I couldn't figure out what they were exactly (one looks like a slice of squash but it was definitely sweet and mochi-like.)  * Really friendly service. Although a bit frenetic at times, but they were very courteous and happy to answer any questions (such as \"Why do those people get served their sushi in a giant wooden boat?\" \"Because it looks great when a big order of sushi can fit on a big wooden boat. Why not?\" \"Word. That's pretty awesome.\")  I'd say the downside of Hana is, like Curtis said, if you're facing the front door and it's lunchtime, you tend to get blinded by all the light streaming in. It's fairly dark inside so the contrast in brightness is pretty huge. I also don't see them being able to accomodate groups larger than 4 at a table, especially during lunch or dinner rush.  All in all, though, I just hope Hana remains as an unpretentious top quality spot for sushi in town. I'm bracing for the onslaught once AZ Central and the New Times get a hold of this place, because it really is too good to pass up and the hype will eventually get there. But as long as they keep girls with names like Taffy from being their servers and keep Linkin Park off their playlist, I think they'll be A-ok.   Will definitely be back for more.  4 stars. (Star #5 will wait until I have a full-on sushi experience for dinner sometime).",

Seasonal variety is great, too.  The lunchtime bento selection is second to none.  The menu is great but always (ALWAYS!) ask about items on the board.  The octopus salad and  asazuke are always great cool sides to beat the heat.  And ask if they have the grilled squid as it is always done perfectly.  If you are looking for fusion sushi, this is not your place.  Solid, perfectly done Japan-style food and preparation is what you will find here.  We come at least twice a month.  Our favorite restaurant in Phoenix!",

I used to come here with my coworkers and we typically got enough sushi to have it served on one of the boats. This is a nice touch and definitely makes the experience a little more interesting. My girlfriend and I had dinner here a few nights ago and the restaurant's service was very good. They were speedy and attentive. I am positive that I will be returning.",

It's definitely worth it though.   As I look at the reviews of other Yelpers, I can't help but think that they're just ordering the wrong things. I mean, good sushi is about good fish. It really kind of bothers me when people say \"I love sushi\" and then either pick the fish off the roll, order something without fish entirely, or order something that's going to be drenched in some American sauce.   The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest.   I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs, it's not the best, but it's the best I've had in the valley. And, I don't know what Jenn H. (review below) ordered to get something covered in mayo? We always get a variety of different things and I have yet to have anything with any weird sauce on it.  I mean, I've probably been there 5 or 6 times, and I can't remember any sauce on anything. When my dad and stepmom came to visit from L.A., they liked this place so much that they actually wanted to go two nights in a row.",

    "text": "Have been wishing for a sushi bar in our neighborhood for a long, long time (especially since Ayako/Akita-ya at The Biltmore closed) - never could have imagined one would open so close to our house and be this great. The sushi gods have blessed us!  We've eaten here regularly since they opened and have never had a bad meal. In fact, we've come to regard sushi chef Koji as a culinary genius (and would back him on Iron Chef any time!) Clever creations like Poki Chips and Tempura Mint Leaf are downright delicious, and he makes the best sashimi and hand rolls we've ever had.  What's best about Hana for us is that this is a neighborhood sushi bar - not a trendy hot spot . Focus here is on the food - and in just the right way. Not overdone like so many sushi spots with countless fancy rolls on the menu - and yet also not overly traditional like so many old-school sushi spots where they only offer standard nigiri and such (which can be quite good, don't get me wrong, but isn't it nice to add a little flavor and creativity, too?)   Being a neighborhood spot, Hana is quite small and can get crowded during peak hours. There's a small dedicated staff here and when crowded, service and food prep can be slow, it's only expected. We like to go later and sit at the sushi bar - to us that's always the best way to eat sushi anyway.",

    "text": "I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular.  Perhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza.  The Good:   - the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful - the tempura was great, light and crisp - the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare.  - the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places. - great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy' - quick, friendly service  The Not so Good - the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen)  - the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!) - the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?) - the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again) - the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen.  One comment on the BYOB.  While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix).  Overall, the experience wasn't memorable.  I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.",

There were some very enjoyable things about Hana, and although it wouldn't be my first choice, I would go back if the choice was up to someone else.  The location is very convenient.  The place is small, and comfortable.  It looks inviting, and the employees are friendly.  They have a very interesting menu, but I had sushi only on this visit.  The sushi is served in a decorative wooden boat. Everything was very fresh, but not what I hoped for...   The sushi was not bad, it just wasn't great.  It was a bit loosely rolled, and fell apart too easily.  They used fake crab instead of the real thing, but did not make that clear on their menu, and they did not have a couple of the things on their menu.  I was really looking forward to their  tamago.  They had not made any that  day.  The waitress who corrected my order and refunded the money I was charged for the tamago was not happy.  It didn't seem to bother her that an item on their regular menu was not available, and I had been charged.  What bothered her is that she had to correct the sale and give me back the overcharge.    It wasn't the best experience, but as I said, the food was very fresh, and except for that one waitress, the employees were very nice.  I will probably give the place another try, it just won't be for a while.",

My highlights: -Oolong tea -Gari  Low lights: -Rice, it was almost like mochi, just a gooey mess. -Fish was VERY cold, it was almost like it was almost to the point of freezing and then served.  Thus leaving the fish with little to no taste. -Loads of scallions on everything, rolls and nigiri.  I assume to give it some flavor. -Nigiri all had loads of ponzu on it.  Once again to give it a flavor.    This place has numerous good reviews and I will tell all of you to look harder!  I had better Japanese in Scottsdale last year, I think it was at Kyoto.  UPDATE UPDATE- Best sushi in PHX is far and away Yasu.  Treat yourself and see what the real deal is like.  You will not be disappointed!",

We split a bento and a few pieces of sushi on the side.   the fish was all very fresh and nicely presented.  Service was spiffy.  The special board has lots on it which we did not explore onthis visit but will on a next visit.  Prices are towards the higfher end for the sushi/sashimi but there are also a lot of other great japanese dishes on the menu.  Would be fine to take a non-fish person there.  One minor complaint was the tea.  A place like this should have decent tea, they served us a grocery grade oolong that was not very good and took away from the experience.",

When we arrived the hostess said she could seat us righ away in a small private room to the right of the restaurant. The room looked dingy. We asked if we could be seated in the main dining room. There was no one else waiting and she said we could sit at the next available table. We waited for about twenty five minuets and a table became available. Immediatey after it was available, a party of three arrived and hostess sat them right away. We asked her why she did that and her excuse was they are a bigger party. After waiting for close to a half hour we left both of hangry. I will never come back here. We are both working professionals who love to dine out.

All of the varieties of sushi I have had here are always reliably good and the fresh.     It is a smaller restaurant, so expect that you might have a little wait time.  The service is sometimes a little hit or miss, I have had terrific wait staff and not so terrific, but overall this is a great go-to.",

That's why I was sooooo disappointed to have a bad experience there. Hubby and I went out for dinner recently and were told by the host that the two open tables were now being reserved for walk-ins of parties of 4 only because, \"we make more money off them.\" That's exactly what he said. He told us that something at the sushi bar was sure to open up soon. Thirty minutes later and still waiting, we now had a growing crowd of two's on the wait list. A party of three walked in and were seated IMMEDIATELY. We should have walked out right then, but we were so hungry we figured it couldn't be much longer. Wrong. We waited another 20 minutes until a table finally opened up. Meanwhile, the table for four remained empty. This is a BAD policy. Seating should be first-come, first-served. I will only be doing takeout there from now on.  The food is 4 star. The wait policy is 1 star.",

They make sure you get what you want and try to accommodate your needs. 2. They actually ask about food allergies!!! Because I have some, this was a big bonus for me. 3. You can tell the rice, fish, and vegetables in the sushi were fresh.  The bad: 1. It's a tad on the expensive side; I could spend as much as I did on two people in another sushi restaurant with similar quality.  The ugly: 1. It's a little crowded in the place because it is so small. Luckily I got a to-go order but it was still a little longer than had anticipated; I waited 7 minutes before leaving because it only took me 10 to get there and they said it would be 15. I got there about 20 minutes after I put in the order, and still waited for about another 15. It wasn't a ridiculous wait, and of course they were accommodating as mentioned previously, but still...I was hungry.  That's about it! I would definitely eat here again!",

Taco sunomo $6 + $3 (taco was added for an extra $3) - came out with cucumber, seaweed, and imitation crab. Everything was good except the cucumber was really sweet.  3. Yellowtail roll $8.5 - good nothing special but I can get it somewhere else for less 4. Hana's Pride $20 - basically cucumber wrapped sashimi. Yes they did give a lot of different sashimi but I don't think it's worth $20.   Paid $60 and left still hungry. Service is good but there's only a couple people preparing the food so to get the food was a good wait.",

The place is a little small, but I like the intimate vibe. They are BYOB, which we did not know so we had iced teas.   Came back with my husband and loved it again. We brought our own 6 pack and they put it in the fridge. We got glasses and a new beer every time we needed one! The food is a little expensive, but I think you're paying for quality. Plus, BYOB can be a money saver if you like to drink. No restaurant up charge.  We will be back! Probably bring a group, stop by Total Wine for a nice bottle of sake and have a great time.",

Also, French grocery is just across the street and you can buy your wine there.   Nice cute little place for good sushi, I was with my sister and brother in law from out of town (Sydney Australia). They ordered miso soup and I got the salt broth ramen. They said miso was tasty but cold. I don't eat always like pork but this ramen has some good pork in it. I splurged and got the soft boiled eggs too (extra dollar and a quarter) but it was worth it.   For sushi, we ordered spicy tuna roll, it tasted AMAZING. The volcano roll, that was tasty but it kept breaking apart, not sure if it's supposed to.   We also got the octopus sushi, the crab and the tempura shrimp which were all equally good.   Hope to come back here again soon.",

Unbelievably delicious food; from the flavorful vegetarian gyoza to the delicately fried tempura, to the crispy tofu (oh my!) to the fresh (oh so fresh) sushi, right down to the warm and soothing bowl of ramen with perfectly cooked soft boiled egg and tender pieces of fresh pork.  3. Bringing friends to a Japanese Eatery who weren't totally onboard before we dined, but afterward swore it was amazingly delicious.  4. BYOB - saved a bundle on our own booze, and the wait staff served our own wine and beer as if it was their own.  5. No comparison anywhere that I have been previously. This place is just about perfect. I am not kidding. Thanks for the Yum!",

After about five minutes, two seats at their small sushi bar opened up and we were offered those. We said we would prefer to wait for a table (we were not planning on ordering sushi).  A couple of minutes later a couple came in and were seated at the sushi bar, which was fine.   Again there were still open tables in view. We continue to stand and wait. Then another group of three came in about 10 minutes later and were promptly offered one of those tables.  Frustrated, we asked if we could be seated at the other open table. They said no.   We would have to wait for one of the 4 or so two top spaces to open up.   I have never seen a restaurant do this. Normally it would be first-come, first-serve seating. It's not like we were wanting to take up a huge table by ourselves.   So, we left. We went across the street to one of our favorites, La Pinata (who was also very busy) where we were promptly seated at an open 4-seat bench table. They have a great ambiance, consistently good food and friendly, competent service.",

    "text": "I want to love this place, I really do.  We don't have good sushi where I live, so I love going out for it when I'm in Phoenix, but I don't know where and what is good.  And I'm sorry, but based on my first experience, Hana might not be that place, though it may be worth a second trip just in case something was off on our first visit, which was admittedly busy.  My main complaint was the sushi was just not quite right.  There are two key things that I look for in sushi.  First, the rice has to have that hit of vinegar.  This didn't.  Second, when getting nigiri sushi where, for example, you have salmon on top of a small pillow of sushi wrapped with a narrow band of seaweed, the protein should have a light shmear of wasabi.  This didn't.  With both of those components missing, the sushi was disappointing.  Having said that, the other elements of our meal were fantastic.  BUT I WANTED GOOD SUSHI!  And Hana, sadly, disappointed.  Maybe it's their style not to do their sushi in the way that I was expecting, I don't know.  I know what I am used to, and I didn't get it.  Otherwise, I loved my meal.  I had a fantastic sauced tuna that was amazing.  I would have loved my tamago, except the rice was disappointing.  Will I give them a second try?  I can't say anything other than 'maybe'.  There's lots of places that I enjoy eating at when I'm in Phoenix, and if I KNOW a place serves across the board great food, then why should I return to a place that disappointed me in one critical area?",

They don't take reservations, and the restaurant was about 90% full at around 730pm, so it's a good balance of popularity and no wait time for a table. We ordered a bunch of stuff: eel sushi, tobiko sushi, some rolls with spicy tuna, Vegas roll, Shrimp Tempura, and miso soup. The food was fine and actually decent if your focus is on BYOB and hanging out with friends - basically not on food. The tempura could be a bit more crispy, and the sushi rolls could be more interesting with ingredients and fish/rice ratio. We didn't order any sashimi since it just didn't look like a fancy Japanese restaurant where you would order fancy toro and uni dishes. Overall, this is a decent and clean place for hanging out over some average sushi with BYOB.",

    "text": "I like Hana, and the service here is pretty great. I definitely think the quality of ingredients is up there, but I don't think the consistently higher price points justify the lackluster presentation and small portions.   Located in its own small plaza, Hana sports sparse tables in a dimly lit interior. Perhaps the dimness is for an intimate ambiance, perhaps it's to keep the inside cool, but it bordered on being difficult to see. Service was attentive and considerate, to the point where our initial host asked if there were any food allergies and our waitress seemed psychic in anticipating tea and soda drink refills.  $15 Rainbow Roll: I rarely mention pricing, but it seems that most of the rolls here are $15 or above. That would be fine if the presentation, portion, and quality all justified it, but I think this roll only did one out of the three. The fish was indeed fresh, but the roll seemed almost sloppily made, with one end obviously devoid of fish. The rolling was also not done well, and the roll fell apart quite easily while picking up.   $15 for Spider Roll: I honestly don't think I've ever seen a Spider Roll priced at $15 unless it included other fish or expensive ingredients. I expected this to be larger than the standard six-piece soft shell crab roll, but it wasn't. Again the ingredients were good, and the soft shell crab was freshly fried with a nice light batter. But again the roll fell apart easily, and the pickled carrot inside was clumsily cut and took up too much space within the already-sparse roll.   Uni and ankimo nigiri: I was so excited that there was uni and ankimo nigiri that night, and of course I had to try both. The uni was fresh and ankimo creamy, but the sushi rice had so much rice vinegar that I had a hard time tasting the delicate flavors of uni and ankimo. After the initial bite where I ate the nigiri in one piece, I took the uni and ankimo off to eat sashimi-style so that the rice wouldn't overwhelm them. Perhaps it's the norm in Arizona (I haven't tried enough places here to tell yet), but the ankimo was also twice as expensive as I'm used to.   $3 for hot tea and $2.50 for soda (free refills). Not a big deal, but it also seems that most sushi places here don't offer complimentary hot tea. Just a tidbit if you're used to it like I initially was. I'm conflicted about Hana; I may come back for the fresh ingredients, but part of me thinks that the price point and other factors don't justify the product.",

That said, the traditional steak and chicken dishes were also good (if a tad bland) and would satisfy those with a less adventurous palate. The sushi and sashimi were very fresh and delicious. The wait staff was really nice and the chef came out at the end of the night to greet us.   Two things to keep in mind. The prices are pretty expensive (typically $10-20/dish), so things can add up very quickly. It is also BYOB. The wait staff was really good about it, keeping our beers cold and frequently asking if we needed more of our alcohol.

The EEL SASHIMI is so succulent This is a Taste of the Real Japan. The owners do make you feel at home and that is a big plus.",

    "text": "It was Friday night and was out with my son, his fiance and his mom for Moms and Sons date night, and we picked Hana as the place to go.  We arrived about 10 minutes before opening, honestly we were not even paying attention to time just chatting it up and were like oh it's not opened yet, and so we just waited.  Hana opened and we were given a choice of where we wanted to sit, at this time they were maybe 3 other parties with us, when we sat down we were handed a menu, and after 5 minutes the server came by and asked if we were ready to order, we said no not yet, then after another 2 the server came back and asked are you ready yet, at this time, we quickly ordered some rolls and drinks, and said we need a few more minutes,  drinks were quickly made and then server was back again asking for our order, this time we just quickly figured out what we wanted.  The rolls came out, some California rolls, Spicy Tuna Roll, Vegas Roll, all the rolls were good, the spicy tuna was my favorite!  For my meal I went with the Miso Ramen, it came with ramen noodles, charred pork, green onion & seaweed and I added a dashi soft boiled egg to it.  The broth had great flavor, the pork and veggies were delsih, the soft boiled egg was a little over cooked to be a soft egg, it just didn't have the thick runny yoke that adds creamy texture to the broth, but overall this is a great bowl of ramen for 15 bucks.   Just mere seconds after I put my spoon down our server came to the table to ask if I was done, and I said yes, and my bowl was quickly taken away.  Our entire time at Hana was apx 35 minutes if that, it felt completely rushed, granted it was a Friday night, but there was no line and no one waiting to be seated, and not even  1/2 the restaurant full, but clearly they only wanted us there to eat and leave, no side talking and they did show frustration with us when we did not have our orders ready to be taken. Being rushed ruined the entire dining experience, sometimes you just feel unwanted and this was one of those situations.    I have been to Hana before, and have enjoyed it and have many friends that enjoy it too, but because of the rushed service, when it wasn't even busy has left a bitter memory with me and my return factor is pretty low.",

Accompanying green adequately dressed. Tempura was crisp, not greasy, and a perfect match for the soy broth and soba noodles. Very tasty!  But Hana, this is how I meant for the food to arrive. I did not want my entree of noodles, followed by my appetizer of oysters and then the greens presented as an after thought. Unfortunately, the three other diners that I was with had the same experience. Food arrived randomly. Rush! Rush! It was like Russian roulette. Then as we were settling into our meal, our server arrived with the check. Whoa Hana!  I know you have a small location and Friday is busy, but let me enjoy the good food that you serve instead of trying to turn a table.",

We got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $30 on a regular spicy tuna roll, a specialty roll and side of steamed rice. $30 seriously? And the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost. Looks like Hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing. A sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $1.50 charge on each bill \"given the recent economy.\" I find that pretty unbelievable. Anyways, the food is generally pretty good. One of my favorites is their Hana salad although I was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix. Again with the cut-backs. Don't get me wrong. I like Hana alot but I think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other Asian spots.",

    "text": "I think I have found my new favorite date night sushi joint.. Last week the illustrious David B.  was recommending Hana to the ole plus one and I .. being the adventurous couple we are ,we invited our sushi friend Paul and family to  join us to try somewhere new.. First Note : Hana is small groups are not their forte..although they nicely accommodated our large 7 person group.  After being seated we took in all the specials on the board and began making sushi plans .. Second Note  : Our waitress had a difficult time understanding our order, not sure if it was language barrier, ordering a little unusual , the larger party or what... daughter doesn't want any wasabi or garnishes on her sushi...  after getting order ins  , it wasn't long before some lovely  sushi began coming our way.  Unfortunate Waitress did not understand daughters order and it came with ta daa  onion garnishes .. the owner (?)  came out and rectified the situation with finesse.. We ordered for hubster and I : Hana roll  a tasty roll with friend shrimp sticking up all over  good stuff, rainbow roll  clean and traditional,  Vegas roll , nice touch because it was fried but not doughy or overly  breaded like some places get it , and a tasty  hot volcano roll  , not the fave but still  a good roll, we also had tako salad our favorite extra at japanese restaurants , theirs is a sweet yet vinegary concoction  that me happy loved it.. Friend   Paully ordered  a seared maguro dinner that looked tasty.  All the food was refreshing and delicious  but here is where it went wrong  Third Note , traditionally in a restaurant when you have a big party of people done with their food  and they are staring at the wait staff and fidgeting with the empty plates and suck on the ice cubes you bring them the check ...guess our waitress did not get that memo... we sat and sat.. finally the womenfolk took the kids across the street for Mary Coyle ice cream to let the men wait in peace. Fourth Note, how do you negotiate the 20% gratuity already added in when the service wasn't up to par?   Well once again owner ? Lyn came to our rescue and rectified the situation .. Hats off to Lyn who did an outstanding job of smoothing over a bad situation.  Because of her we will go back and give Hana another try  just with a smaller group and not the same waitress.  Oh and BTW  they use Sweet Republic for their ice cream .. got give that a try next time...",

It is located in a shopping center,right on the end. There is a decent amount of parking. The fun thing is you can bring your own booze in. Either beer or wine. You do not see that in many places, so I like it.  The food is really fresh and quite good. I am not a huge fan of healthy food, but I will do it for T's sake. I do like it here though, not too bad at all. It is a bit small in here. So it can get crowded fast. It is clean ,and the staff is fun and nice.",

We were a party of 2, and I had the dish with the buckwheat noodles. I wanted to try them. When the male server (probably the same notorious dark haired one found in other reviews) came by to ask me how it was, I said I didn't like it. He said, \"you're weird\" and walked away. Who says to their customer they are weird?? I'm supporting this business by coming in here. I'm paying your salary (in part). But apparently it doesn't matter because this place is still in business. Didn't hurt them any when I didn't come back. I also didn't take leftovers home.  Obviously no tip. They were lucky I paid the bill.  Anyone can do better than plunking down $40 here.",

We waited a bit for a table...probably around 25-30 mins, but once we were seated, the service was quick. Our food came out fast and our server was friendly.   We ordered a tuna tataki roll and a spicy tuna roll...they both melted in our mouths. The tuna was so fresh and I am salivating now as I write this review. Also we ordered the gyoza which was good, but standard. My husband partook in a ramen noodle bowl and he loved it. The bowl was HUGE though. Order with caution...must be hungry or plan on sharing.   We will be back VERY soon and I cannot wait. It's so rare to find a solid sushi spot in PHX, but now we have our \"go-to\"...YAY.  BONUS: It's BYOB!",

Once seated i was greeted by a nice young waitress who took care of me the whole time. Great atmosphere and great presentation. However, the most important part, is the food.  I was given a free rabit-food appetizer (that's a salad). It was pretty tastey and a very nice touch to the rest of my meal. There was only one ramen item on the menu, but when i asked the waitress, she listed about 5 i could choose from. I got the Tonkatsu. It came out farely quick but once it was in front of me, I was greeted by a pretty gnarly smell. How disapointing. It smelt like stinky pork that lived in its own filth. I'm brave,  so I dove in anyway. I did eat every last drop. Not bad at all, but i dared not go further. Check came quick and I was on my way with a smile.   Come here for the atmosohere and the service. Not so much the food.",

    "text": "If you are reading this review because you are planning to eat sushi alone, look elsewhere. I am not reviewing the sushi!  I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks). This place is tolerable if you want ramen. However, I cannot say anything of the sushi. I am not a big fan of sushi since I can only eat the non-shellfish variety. The atmosphere is lovely, the waiters are polite, and the service is bearable.",

We went on the Friday before Labor Day, so when we first walked in it was pretty slammed. It looked as if the small restaurant was overwhelmed with the fast paced staff, so we were a little worried about the service. It turned out we had nothing to be worried about, the service was great! We ordered the yellow tail nigiri, salmon skin roll and ebi yakisoba. The fish in the sushi was high quality and very fresh tasting (for Arizona). I don't normally order hot food, but decided to venture out and it was well worth it. The ebi yakisoba was very good, with shrimp that was marinated and cooked very well, and vegetables that were fresh and crunchy. I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Came here after our Diamondbacks -Giants Game at the Chase Field. It was a Friday night, and this place was packed; so we had to wait a little bit which gave us time to study the menu.  Then finally, we were seated at the bar; with a warm welcome from Lynn. Lynn was very welcoming and she took time answering my questions with the specialties on the board. Me? Lots of questions with Sushi??? I'm like a sushi goddess...but why? Well.... some of the Specials on the board were priced at $20/roll. Unless maybe it's topped with Toro.. (actually, with Toro and just Toro, it could be a little bit more) I've never seen a roll priced that much in the SF Bay Area. I was thinking maybe because fish in Arizona is expensive. Okay that could be it...  Anyway... here's a breakdown of what we ate...  *Poke Chips: Complimentary... Definitely a brush of flavor to get your tastebuds rolling....  *Uni Shooters: $5.00 each. My boyfriend who will never eat Uni Liked it. I loved it. If this gives a person a buzz, I'd get drunk with this every single day. The ponzu sauce brings, the green onion, the quail egg...and the uni... wow.. them all... is like seeing Unicorns in the sky.....  *Hana Pride: $20.00.. This roll is so refreshing; and different and FRESH. The 2 rolls in the middle ensembles a stash of sashimi slices of 6 different kinds of fish, all held by this cucumber warp. The insight on making this roll was amazing. First time i've ever seen one.  *Yellowtail Roll: One of their regularly priced roll... Good amount of yellowtail; artistically made... and Fresh hamachi. I like how the rice was even and there wasn't too much of it.  *Spider Roll: I was surprised how big this roll was. Definitely a favorite.  *Baked Salmon Roll: my boyfriend's favorite.... in the bay area, it's just like a Lion King... I loved the yellow sauce, the topping..and how perfectly it's baked.  ***Lynn made us try fresh wasabi... AMAZING. never had that before.  If you're in the Phoenix area... Hana should definitely make it to your list...  We devoured everything we ordered......and Lynn was amazed. The couple next to us only had 2 rolls, with some leftover rolls. haha!  Lynn, if you're reading this!!! Thank you so much for our amazing dinner!! we enjoyed your creations!   ps: They don't serve beer. BUT what's even better... it's BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!",

I've been to Hana dozens of times and have spent 3 birthdays there. I always order the volcano roll no matter what. It's so delicious. Baked to perfection! The spicy tuna roll is delicious as well.

The fish is extremely fresh and well cut. Hamachi sashimi is about as good as I've had in AZ. I throughly enjoyed the sashimi salad as well - tons of fresh fish mixed in with nice greens and tasty dressing.   As for everything else, service is good enough, pace of kitchen is satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing here, but all good enough to keep coming back. Waitstaff is friendly. They hurry you a bit sometimes but it does get busy often so it's somewhat understandable.   Overall a great place for fresh quality sushi and the byob is great as you can save the markup on a great bottle of sake or wine.   Sushi: excellent Service: friendly, satisfactory Ambiance: neighborhood joint. Nothing fancy, not a dump though Price: very fair for some stuff, a bit overpriced for others.",

If the fish required more than a 2 hour plane ride, I'm eating beef or poultry.  I moved to Phoenix about 10 years ago and was truly dismayed at the sushi options. If a California Roll with fake crabmeat is great sushi, I'm out too.  My wife found Hana about 6 years ago and we continue to make the trip over to the west side for truly excellent sushi. The proprietor (and everyone behind the sushi bar) is extremely knowledgeable and truly an artist in his preparations. We tend towards eating more sashimi than nigiri or maki sushi so the fish has to be extremely fresh! In over a dozen trips to this hidden gem we have never been disappointed.  It's BYOB, so bring sake or beer.  Their green tea is excellent too. They get busy so get there early or bring patience. It's worth the wait. Best in Phoenix and very reasonable!

There was something about the rice that was off, a friend of mine informed me it was a certain brand of rice very untraditional with sushi.   Anyway, the ambiance was great and the sever was friendly enough. I certainly wouldn't go back for the sushi as it was priced a little high and overall flavor lacked quality. However, I would go back to check out the regular menu. Also, it would be a fun place to go on a date which BTW....I was on.",

    "text": "Looking for cheap quality sushi and supermarket prices? Then Hana is not for you.   Looking for high quality fish that is well prepared and presented, and are you prepared to get what you pay for? Then Hana is for you.   I've been going to Hana since they opened years ago and have never been disappointed in any way.  I'm still amazed at how some conveyor belt sushi connoisseurs turn their noses up at having to  fork out a couple of extra bucks for what is arguably the best sushi in Phoenix.   So if you appreciate really good Japanese food and understand that you get what you pay for, then Hana is for you.  If you don't, and want to skimp, then there's some sushi at the Safeway right down the street.  If you can't find it it's right next to chicken tenders and mac & cheese by the deli counter.",

    "text": "IN MY TOP 5 WORLDWIDE FOR JAPANESE CUISINE. Perfection in execution from master chef Kazsan _every time_. Think Jiro-level. Your meal will always be excellent. Sometimes it will be life changing. Get on a plane and GO. I do.  No matter where I go when I travel, I am comparing technique to this temple of Japanese Cuisine, Hana. Each of the following is a delight, whether sets-the-standard best-of in the world \"standards\" from the cuisine, or Hana's own culinary creations. Where shall I begin? So many favorites. Let's go.  FROM THE CUISINE OF \"STANDARDS\" ++ Krab-stick tempura. (off-menu) My comfort food. Tempura is light, crispy, airy, hot, savory, unctuous, and delectable. They use potato flour. (Okay, this isn't a standard, it's my idea, but i love it.) ++ Miso soup. Served piping hot and steamy, instant nirvana of umami. Slurp loudly to show your appreciation. Really. It's a thing. ++ Okra salad. Sliced razor thin and with delectable carrot and sesame seeds. ++ Okonomiyaki. Literally \"How you like\", grilled. Cabbage, noodles, layers of your choice of protein, covered with sauces and flakes. Think \"Japanese Pizza\". Cut small pieces with the cutter and devour! ++ Shabu shabu. Delectable mild broth with thinly sliced beef and veg on the side which you place in the broth and cook to taste. (Book your table at 5pm and days in advance) ++ Tamago. Think delicate, light and sweet razor-thin layers of egg, wrapped over and over on itself into a \"cake\". Seaweed wrapper and nigiri rice. Best done in two bites. ++ Ankimo. Monkfish liver pate. With salty sour sauce (Mike, you should learn these names) and garnish.  ++ Chawan Mushi. Japanese savory seafood egg custard slash souffle. Perfect execution. Solid throughout, smooth, silky. Celebration of egg. ++ Ama ebi platter. Raw body and tail, nigiri style. Heads tempura battered and fried. Yum. Squeeze of lemon and done. ++ Miso Ramen. Think umami explosion in your mouth to the level that you may have trouble tasting much of anything else for a bit. It's sooooo good.  THE FISH. Ah the fish. Whatever they say is on special, get it. Full stop. Tuna, O Toro, Spanish Mackerel, Squid, Sea Urchin, HUGE Oysters (cut in three), Octopus, Scallop, ah the list goes on and on.  ++ Lamb chops (Lorisan) marinated and grilled. Heaven in each bite. ++ Uni shooters (Lorisan) squishy, salty, savory, eggy, fishy, sour flavor surrounds and complements the silky and nutty uni. Enjoy! ++ Hana Lobster. Creamy, sour, salty, luscious lobster goodness. With asparagus and pea. +++ Onsen Tamago. Japanese onsen is a style of bathing where you ladle water over your head while seated. Imagine a savory broth bath over an egg to slowly bring it to temperature. Yeah, it's THAT delicate. It takes 40 minutes and Kazsan must be in a good mood to serve it.   ++ Hana an mitsu. Red bean, berries, mandarin orange, strawberry, aloe dessert. With squishies and marshmallows. Oh how i love the squishies.  FINALLY, THE DON'T-DO-IT RULES Hint: this is not a place to go for your American-style rolls. Yes, they serve them, but that's not what Japanese cuisine is about. ## DO NOT rub your chopsticks together. It is SO rude. Believe me, they are watching you and secretly want to escort you out by your ear. If I see you do it, I might be the one to take you by the ear! ## DO NOT stick your chopsticks into anything and leave them there, especially rice. It's very rude, and connotes death.  I'm not sure why those three old photos below from my iPhone5 are linked here. Check out the main photo library. Many of them are mine.",

Even better, the food here is outstanding, so I have reasons to come back and try more of their cuisine.  On our visit we had the tempura appetizer, the Yakibuta (slow marinated pork), and the tuna tataki roll. The tempura was light, not greasy and had a fun array of veggies plus shrimp. Really enjoyed it.  However, the Yakituba and tuna tataki roll were unlike anything else I've had, and I would hands down order both of those again. The pork in the Yakibuta legitimately fell apart, it was so tender. And the tataki roll was so fresh and flavorful, but the little garlic chips on top gave it an extra punch of flavor that was fantastic.  Note: Hana is BYOB, and you are welcome to bring anything you'd like to drink without a corkage fee, so if you have a favorite wine or sake you like to enjoy, definitely bring it along with you!  Really enjoyed our meal here and cannot wait to come back!",

Maybe we ordered unwisely, but I just didn't love it as much as I wanted to. - Hana salad- baby greens were slightly tough, topped with a nice lemony dressing and shaved parm and some slice avo. Tasty? Sure, but not what you expect at a Japanese eatery. - Nimono- roasted root veggies were my fave with a slightly sweet soy flavor, yum! - Hana pride roll- $20- yikes! This is not a traditional roll, no rice, so be prepared. The fish was fresh, but the cucumber wrapper was thick and a bit tough. Fine, just not my style. - Sukiyaki- this was pretty tasty, with mushrooms, thinly sliced beef, big cubes of tofu, and a really fab soy sake broth that tastes nothing like miso soup. We took our server's sage advice and added noodles, too.  Service was great, food was A-OK. Though I wouldn't make the trek from home, I'd def return if in that neighborhood to try out a few more items on the menu- for sure more of the sushi options.",

With my favorite sushi place closing down I thought well I'll give it a shot. The girls walking in greeting me were so sweet. Sat at sushi bar I have never seen a group of sushi chefs so uninspiring and unfriendly. This put me off right away but ok I'll give it a shot. They had my uni so I was happy. I heard great reviews saw great pictures...of there sushi. Again not my experience. My ph was dead or I would of taken photos..16 dollars for 6 pieces of paper this hamachi just stuck on a plate was presented with any of the artistic beauty that you would expect from Japanese cuisine. Portions expensive and small. I went for uni...so disaponted it was poor quality I later that eve went to a different establishment not Japanese they had a piece of uni that I would of expected from a Japanese resteraunt. That one piece of uni was more than the six little  pieces I payed way to much for. The place I ate the uni was served over four gras it was 28. The uni on it's own was 20 at Hana it wasn't form it was watery mushy.  Dont serve it if you cant get high quality uni. Maybe I came on a bad night they have there locals but I have been to resteraunts with less hipe and better quality. Definitely more friendly sushi chefs I have never met a group of the most uninviting chefs.  I will not go back....! So what's more disgusting I went to a lower so call class sushi bar with better quality. Hana is over rated over priced unfriendly I'm so disappointed.  I guess that is what happens when you expand Dont go there so many better places .....80 dollars for horrible food. I may as well have gone to Safeway. In addtion I tried to lower star after going to a supposed lower rated resteraunt who's clearly exceeded Hana they live on there rep not quality.  There are far better places to go .....font go I'll tell you look downtown and more places opening all better than this place.",

It's hidden in a small strip center on 7th Ave and Missouri and doesn't look like much from the outside. The inside however is quaint, dimly lit and has the feel of a hole-in-the-wall type place (which are always the best). The staff was attentive and very friendly throughout our meal.   The menu is gluten free and vegetarian friendly, a must for me. We ordered a chicken dish appetizer, spicy tuna rolls, a rainbow roll and the Hana roll. The chicken was really just like chicken nuggets, nothing too impressive. The sushi was fresh, presented beautifully (my pictures don't do it justice) and arrived quickly.   However, the $70+ bill was a little shocking. The Hana roll alone was $20, which is quite a bit more expensive than other sushi places. While the food was good, I don't personally feel the quality, service, etc warranted the prices.",

HOWEVER there are 2 sushi restaurants in Phoenix named Hana and they are NOT the same.  The one you should end up at is called Hana Japanese Eatery and is located at 5524 N 7th Ave Phoenix. It is NOT the Hana Sushi located #3, 602 West Union Hills Drive  Phoenix, AZ 85027. We found this out the hard way after Googling Hana and driving to the wrong location.We realized right away we were at the wrong Hana and left immediately to find the right one.  Glad we did as the Sushi at Hana Japanese Eatery was some of the best we have eaten in a long time. Rolls were unique, large, an very fresh! Service was excellent as well and prices very fair for the high quality Sushi that arrived on our table. Also one of the best Miso soups wee have had in a long time. Our absolute favorites of the rolls we ordered were  the Spicy Tuna hand rolls and the Baked Salmon roll. Just incredible!   A first for us as well was that along with the standard Wasabi Paste you get at every Sushi joint, you also get fresh chopped Wasabi plant. It looks like relish when they serve it, but it's actual Wasabi plant. It's fiery hot and really awesome on the sushi. It is clear why this place is rated highy by Zagat and well reviewed. Amazing and Fresh Sushi with great service!! 5 Stars well deserved.",

If you want fresh fish and great staff thus is the place to be.   Lori the owner is always there when we come and she always makes sure to say hi even when she has a house full.   We love the sushi especially the volcano roll and the spicy tuna. We also order the hamachi Kama (sp?) which is a cooked underbelly of tuna. Amazing!   Try this place if you want great sushi!",

We went for a Valentine's Day dinner  since my husband is a chef and will be working tomorrow and were delighted to try their Walu special. It was absolutely phenomenal, cooked perfectly and delicious. However.... Walu is also known as escolar had my husband known that it was escolar we would never have ordered the fish. We got home only to have extreme intestinal issues that are commonly associated with eating this fish (Google escolar). We called the restaurant to speak with a manager to let them know that their servers should say what the fish is... Escolar when letting patrons know the specials for the night and got a bit of attitude. Under normal circumstances I would give the maximum amount of stars but considering I am married to my toilet for the next few days one could say it's unethical to serve customers something that is known for giving people who eat it horrible stomach issues. Escolar is banned in Japan for crying out loud and I would have preferred to have made a conscious decision on whether I wanted to consume it.",

The yellow tail, toro, golden thai, and the holomokosomethingorother were so good and fresh that it basically melted in the mouth.  The pickled wasabi root that came with the Yellowtail was also quite excellent.   Apparently they get their fish in on Thursday, so if you want it fresh, Thursday is the day to go.  That's when I went and I gotta say Wow!  So good. The bill wasn't exactly cheap, but it isn't every day that you get that fresh of fish in Phoenix that meets that quality. A+  I will definitely be back (on a Thursday)",

Their house rolls are worth trying.  2. you can bring your own beer.  saves tons of $$$ - and they don't charge you extra for the glasses.  3. the manager/owner is a very bossy, older Asian woman who gives you a real run for your money.  The woman doesn't waste a second, and will tell you what to order if you can't decide, even though you haven't asked.  It's entertaining, and I'm always a fan of the pushy Asian mother-types.  4. they serve your sushi in a big fancy boat, which is way too big for the table but satisfies my need for drama in dining experiences.  It's a real \"ta-daa!\" at the dinner table.  I definitely recommend this place.  It's fun, the food is good, and as I said before, you can bring your own beer!",

I usually order sushi and several items from the 'special' menu on the wall.  The fish is so tasty, raw or cooked!  Also, the rice is really good here. (I know, it's silly but it's really key to a good Japanese meal to me :))  The menu consists of variety of Japanese comfort foods too so you can try different types of Japanese food other than Sushi and Sashimi.  I love the BYOB so you can bring your own alcoholic drink, if you so desire.  They'll keep the bottles chilled and serve it to you when you want to refresh your drink.  I believe they'd also warm up your sake if you like it hot.  The inside is quite small so if you don't want to wait - for dinner -  (there's not much of a waiting area either) I suggest to get there right when they open :)  If you like Japanese food, this is the place to go :)  Arigatou!",

For those of you not looking to eat sushi, the rest of their menu is excellent. If you are in the mood for a traditional Japanese frozen treat, stop by and try the mochi ice cream! I recommend the mango.  Hana is BYOB! Take advantage of this and pick up a bottle of sake on your way. Kanpai!",

The spicy tuna was good giving a little extra per piece after the sushi was already cut. Quail egg shooter was delicious. Hamachi Kama was disappointing because it was over cooked and burned at some parts leaving certain parts of the yellowtail collar to be dry and not as mouth melting as it should be. The squid nigiri was good but not the best. I was disappointed they gave me a specials sheet but was out of some things I wanted to try. Especially the monk fish liver. The service was very quick and friendly. I would definitely come back and eat here again to try other things on the menu",

They accent with little ingredients  that make the food and presentation so much better and interesting.  The fish is out of this world.  We give chef Kojisan the option to create a dinner for us (my partner and I) and what comes out from behind that bar is natural goodness enhanced by a master's creative touch.  They know us at Hana.  We get the rockstar treatment along with good suggestions and samples of something new on the menu.  We are usually blown away.  We had the ramen noodles last night for the fist time.  Wow!!!  That pork was incredible.  For the first time we tried the Kobe beef sashimi.  Not bad.  Not bad.  The staff at Hana are super friendly.  They are always wearing smiles in that busy atmosphere.  There are seldom new faces within the staff.  The employees stick around.  It must be a great place to work.  It is a fun environment.  Hana does it right.  In all aspects.",

We ordered a bunch of sushi and were totally bummed that we didn't read about them ahead of time to know that they are BYOB.   But beyond lacking good wine to couple with the food, we had a great mix of the typical spicy tuna roll, hana roll (good...love tempura....even if it makes me slightly a sushi sell out), tamago nigiri, seaweed salad, and squid sashimi. All really really good. I was totally impressed.  The only downside about this place was that we waited about 20 minutes after receiving our first wave? of food to receive our squid sashimi. I also heard the table next to us mention that they had been waiting 30 minutes for a california roll (wtf?) and they had already finished their entire meal. The table behind us had the same complaint. So, I could kind of get it for squid (I assume you have to cut that extra carefully!) but california rolls...last I checked that isn't sushi science.  Overall, I was truly impressed. The only advice I would have is to send the entire order out at once...",

    "text": "This is some of the best sushi I have ever had, obviously fresh and made to perfection. The taste was rivaled only by the presentation, the Caterpillar Rolls looked like a caterpillar, complete with sprout antenna and octopus sucker eyes. My Calamari looked like a little squid was so fresh and tender it nearly melted in my mouth. The menu has a lot to offer for non-sushi lovers, too. The service was great, four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables. Highly recommended!",

Walked in, jammed, figured it would be a long wait......surprise, within 15 minutes we were at the counter - which was an awesome place to luck into sitting. Our waitperson, Carol - outstanding!! - guided us through the extensive menu......as usual when we're new to somewhere, we over-order.....but oh so good.  Sushi was killer - best I've had since Honolulu.  Love the BYOB - our Chardonnay was a tad warmish by the time we got seated, but staff brought over an ice bucket (classy!)..... We'll definitely be back - maybe just won't order so much.  Agreed with some reviewers can be a tad pricey - but given the quality, I don't mind paying........worth a visit if you have shied away so far.",

    "text": "Have been to Hana a handful of times and continue to be impressed. It is the freshest sushi I have had in Phoenix. It tends to fall on the pricier side, but the quality is absolutely worth it. It's also a BYOB, which is great. The servers are attentive and efficient, and can provide lots of information and suggestions. Don't forget to check out the specials board behind the sushi bar for some interesting choices.   The menu seems a bit more traditional, but exquisitely executed. The pickled wasabi is fantastic. I recommend using it with any sashimi. This is not a venue where you need to drench anything in soy sauce and wasabi. The noodle dishes are delicious as well.   And don't miss out on dessert. They have selections from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale that are brilliant.",

We all got sushi, I got a little bit ahead of myself and got a Hana Bento Lunchbox. The sushi was great, we were the first ones there when it opened so we got our food fairly quickly. The place did get busy as lunch time rolled around. I didn't give this place 5 stars because when it was time to pay our checks they told us that we were each going to be charged an extra $1.50 for a split charge fee. That kind of pissed me off because how hard is it to really split a check? And why wouldn't you do it for free knowing that you're located by office buildings? I just don't understand the fee and because of this none of us are willing to go back now.",

We were both blown away at the Hana Bento box ($15 and I was stuffed with leftovers).  We split two desserts, the creme filled tempura and deep fried mango ice cream.  Both were great, though the chocolate sauce was almost too much sweetness.  The waiter was very attentive, and when we asked to split the check with two cards he was overly-apologetic about explaining the $1.50 fee per card, which we were happy to pay. I've heard amazing things about this place and I live nearby, so I'm kicking myself for not having gone sooner.  It is so fantastic and Lori and Lynn are philanthropists to boot!

The photos on their website show such an assortment but no identifiable names to take to the restaurant to order.  Overall very good experience, but do not order the green tea ice cream - tastes like soap!  Green tea ice cream tastes like green tea!  BYOB is great plus!

    "text": "Bummer......I had high hopes, but I was disappointed.  Prior Yelp reviews have been quite good for 'Hana'. After I munched some sushi here last night, I re-read their reviews and found that my sushi  experience here was consistent with the most recent reviews......average at best.  I've been visiting Phoenix from my home in the SF Bay Area for several weeks now and my sushi jones was growing unmanageable.......I had to have SUSHI! Per Yelp reviews, I chose Hana as the provider of said sushi. I ordered  nigiri style sushi,(raw fish on a small rice base)......one order each of  hamachi(yellow tail), sake(salmon) and (unagi)fresh water eel. As opposed to most other types of sushi, unagi is not served raw; it's grilled on a hibachi after being coated with a teriyaki type sauce.  The sake and hamachi were no better than average and the unagi was sub-standard. The sake was lacking in flavor, the hamachi  likewise; the unagi had plenty of flavor, but the flavor was from the sauce on it....not from the unagi. Rightly or wrongly.....I WANNA TASTE THE FISH!...... I also had one order  of 'sake maki'; 'maki' style is fish with rice and nori(seaweed) rolled on outside of the fish. The roll is then cut into six small pieces for presentation......I like nori, and  'maki' rolls are more filling than nigiri style sushi; however, the salmon in my 'sake maki' was also lacking in flavor.    I attribute the flavorlessness in my sushi to the quality of the fish being used by Hana; in all the sushi I ate at Hana, the fish was 'lean'. As with good steak, sushi's flavor and tender texture are dependent on how much 'fat' is in the flesh. Hana uses fish that's low in fat content. Sushi grade fish is available from suppliers in different grade levels...... the higher the fat content in the fish, the higher the grade level(flavor content) of the fish. Higher fat content fish costs more from the vendor. Hana prices their sushi at high grade prices, but serves sushi made from standard grade fish, thus.....less flavor in the sushi.   Added edit:   Hana does offer sushi from 'wild' sake(salmon) at the higher price of $10; that price is more than a little expensive and as I didn't try it, I don't know if it has more fat/flavor than the 'regular' sake they serve.  'Nuff said.  By the way, fish fat, as opposed to red meat fat, is good for you due to the omega 3 content in fish fat.",

    "text": "Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, this \"one star\" rating is based upon the shockingly cruel service we received from our server, and not necessarily the food.  A group of friends and myself dined here on a Saturday night (February 2nd, 2008).  There were eight of us out to celebrate our friend's birthday.  Hana does not accept reservations and it was busy, so we did have to weight about an hour and fifteen minutes for a table.  Totally understandable, and I do not fault the restaurant for this at all.  However, when one of the servers directed us to our table and we started to sit down, another server yelled at us to get up because he wasn't done placing the settings (we did not know this).  This was the beginning of the abuse.  For the remainder of the meal, this particular server (a stocky, young guy with black hair) proceeded to treat us as if we were an inconvenience to him.  He threw menus at us, and would only return to the table for the briefest of seconds to see if we were ready to order.  When it took more than a few seconds for us to poll the table, he would walk off in a huff.  One of my friends did not see the water that the server placed at the end of the table, and so when he asked for water, he was yelled at.  Another friend who asked for a side salad with his sushi was told simply \"no.\" (a bunch of us just shared with him).    We all enjoyed the sushi.  My husband did not enjoy his ramen soup (the broth was really briney). When the server asked him if he wanted to take it home, my husband said, \"no thanks.\"  The server asked him directly if he didn't like it, so my husband said, \"not really.\"  But then assured him that everybody else really enjoyed their dishes.  The server then replied, \"everybody else is welcome back, then.\"  This was not said humorously, by the way.    The server would not let us split the bill on several cards (although it was almost $300) and so my friend, who's birthday it was, had to chip in for us to cover the bill.  You might ask yourself, why not just leave the waiter a poor tip to send a message on the inappropriateness of the service?  Well, because our party was large, gratuity was included.  In fact, I think the server knew this from the start and just decided to treat us terribly knowing that he would pull a $25 tip either way.  This was so embarassing, given that this was a friend's birthday.  I had a cake waiting in  the car that I was going to ask the restaraunt if they would let me serve.  Given how mean the service was, we decided to abandon that idea and just head across the street to Mary Coyles for dessert.  It's wierd, I've encountered bad service before, but never just downright cruel.  I'm wondering if the owners know about this guy's behavior?  So all in all:  good sushi, but not worth the abuse.  Maybe this is a better restaurant for one or two people to just sit intimately?  I'm really bummed about my experience since I had read really positive reviews.",

Maybe a three star rating is too harsh, because at the end of the day it is one of the better sushi spots I have been to in Phoenix. However, it is still worlds away from my favorite (see my other reviews). Anyways, a couple of things happened at our lunch that dropped my review from 4 to 3 stars. First, despite not serving alcohol, my party of two wracked up a $100 lunch tab...so it isn't cheap. Second, while we were eating they were cleaning the restaurant with a very offensive industrial type cleaner. The smell completely overwhelmed the delicate flavor of some of the fish. Finally, we ordered a toro tataki.,,which was prepared with a kitchen torch. Something must have went wrong because the fish took on an overwhelming flavor of propane gas.",

The BYOB is a nice touch and that doesn't seem to be changing.  You can get served outside now and even take you wine out there.  It's a little lackluster out there but gives that kind of 'urban feel' to your evening. Plan to wait on Friday and Saturday and I wouldn't suggest a group inside....tight space.",

    "text": "I love Hana!  I really wish I had gone there tonight instead of Moto, which is horrible.   But anyway, back to Hana.  I've been there quite a few times.  It's best to go early--around 5:30, right when they open.  When I've gotten there around 5:30-5:45, I haven't had to wait in line.  Otherwise, it gets pretty packed and you'll probably end up waiting.   Everything I've ever had here is good.  Salmon nigiri is my favorite, and theirs is delicious.  The salmon is so buttery and flavorful, and not nasty and fishy tasting like at some places.  They put pieces of lemon on each piece of fish, which makes the flavor come out in a delightful way.   Every roll I've had has been delicious.  I really like the shrimp tempura roll, and the Hana roll (which is similar) is also good.  Those are the two rolls I've had there most recently.   They also do takeout--so I get takeout sushi here when I'm stressed from work and feel like splurging.  It's always worth it.    Their squid salad is also delish, and so is the pork gyoza.   As for the service, it's always been great every time I've been there.  We've had the same waiter the past few times--not sure of his name, but he's kind of hipstery and has dark hair.  He's always very friendly and helpful.    Good to know--it's BYOB.  But I had a problem once--I brought a Jack Daniels brand malt liquor beverage--similar to a Smirnoff Ice or something.  I guess the owner thought it was pink whiskey, because they wouldn't let us drink it.  But, they're cool with beer & wine.  The waiter said he'd look into drinks like the ones I brought to find out if they're ok under the liquor license that the restaurant has, so I'm not sure if that rule has changed or not.    I definitely recommend Hana.  I plan to go back again ASAP.",

On two of the occasions we came in with large tables, about 8 people. Frankly the place is a bit small for that, but they accommodated us cheerfully and took very good care of us. Our last visit, on Saturday about a week ago was with 8 people. When we arrived the place, including the sushi bar and patio, was full and they had two other 8 tops. We were seated in about 30 minutes (they don't take reservations but if you have a large party and call ahead they do their best) and were immediately given drinks. Our waitress VOLUNTEEERED to split the check (unheard of!) and did so perfectly into four and with great care. While we were waiting they took our wine and Sake and Chilled it for us and brought it out immediately after we were seated, even splitting the sake into warm and chilled carafes at their own suggestion. The food came out quickly despite the full house and was well received; about 6 of our guests that night were first timers. Every morsel of every dish was eaten and then we ordered more. I see other complaints about the salads and etc. in other reviews, I can't comment I have never eaten anything but sushi there and it has always been excellent, fresh and carefully prepared. My favorites: Dynamite Scallops, Tempura Roll, Spider Roll, Vegas Roll, Poki Chips, Caterpillar roll. It also cracks me up that they sometimes play MXC on the flat screen at the back of the restaurant. Also, the last two times we took 3 or four bottles of wine and were not charged a corkage fee, I assume that this was a courtesy as we spent a couple of hundred dollars on food, but it was appreciated and noticed.",

I'm sure this influenced my perception in some way.  He has issues with \"personal space\", so being at the end of a crowded sushi bar with a server  reaching over us, which I must admit was in poor form (the serve could have easily taken two more steps to the edge of the bar instead of reaching over our heads) was not ideal.  Plus, I was out to dinner with my ex-boyfriend. Need I say more?  This is never advisable.  I may need to go back another night to sample the fare under more favorable conditions.  We shall see.",

    "text": "First time to Hana...it's in my hood and I've been wanting to try it.  Favorable reviews from others, so my neighbors and I decided to go.  Very good food (not up to par with some other Japanese spots we love in other cities, but still very good).  We were having a wonderful time, enjoying conversation while paying the bill, and no longer than a few minutes after our bill was paid, the owner (we suspect) came over to our table and ASKED US TO LEAVE!  \"I'm sorry, but there are people waiting outside....\" she said.  We were stunned!  First time in the place, had to leave to go buy wine as we didn't know there was no alcohol, but still ended up having a really good meal until the end.  Now, it was 8:45pm on a Wednesday when we were asked to leave so the people waiting could sit (don't know why just we were asked to leave).  We walked out to see three people (one party) waiting outside the door.  The evening mood was totally changed.  I've never been asked to leave...anywhere...even totally hip, very busy spots in Chicago, Denver, LA.  Weird.  Not sure if we'll go back which is too bad since the food was very good.",

The waitstaff were quite nice and very accommodating, and the rolls were quite good and reasonably priced. The restaurant is BYOB which I rather like.  The rolls were very good and the fish tasted very fresh. The tuna rolls are $8, California rolls around $7 and various specialty rolls for $11-$12. They will also make the rolls to your own spiciness liking.  On the fun side, the rolls are served on a wooden boat with a flaming sugar cube!  The place is small and i can see how it could be quite noisy in there if it is busy. They charge $1.50 fee per credit card if you want to pay with more then 1 card. Overall I enjoyed Hana and will most likely be returning!",

    "text": "We're regulars at what I strongly believe to be the best sushi in the Valley, and I've been meaning to write a glowing review on Yelp for some time now.  The staff is incredibly friendly, making the service seem effortless.  Its one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix--BYOB.  When you arrive, they put your beer or Reisling in the fridge, and you get it extra cold as they seat you. (Keep in mind that its a really small restaurant, and there is often a short wait before being seated.) They have the standard selection of rolls, with a rotating daily selection of specials.  The fish is nice and fresh, which isn't necessarily the case with sushi in Arizona.  The portions are also generous, and there are a few surprises to the standard rolls.  The specials are all generally good, and I think we've tried most all of them.  The poke chips (chopped up tuna on tortilla/wonton type chips) were a recent miss, but other than that, highly recommended to just let your server suggest what ever is the freshest that day. Another secret about Hana--if you reserve 24-48 hours ahead, they will shop at the market, and make a custom Sunday night feast for you which you can cook at your table. Its ideal for a large group, and totally seasonal and different than anything on the menu.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 but unfortunately that's not possible and I felt the experience leaned more toward 3 stars.    So first off we got there on a busy Saturday and it was packed and extremely loud, to the point where you have to yell at the people across your table and can barely hear your server. Then we learned that it was BYOB, but luckily there's a corner market nearby that you can acquire alcohol at.   We were told a 15 min wait and that it was a \"high guess\" but it still took about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad. Finally after getting our table and beer we looked over the menu which had a good amount of items on it and were all very tasty, albeit a bit pricey (20$ for 6 pieces of mackerel are you serious?!). Our appetizers came and they were very good although they were all fried and that's pretty hard to mess up, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and would recommend them.  By this point it really starts sinking in that it's very hard to talk and have conversation. I don't mind a rowdy atmosphere at a bar where it's expected and part of the experience, but at a delicate sushi restaurant that doesn't even serve alcohol, I was kind of shocked at the volume. You'll think I'm joking until you're in there and realize that there's no padding or insulation whatsoever and that sound is just reverberating off the walls. It was something we dealt with for the time being but when I remember this place I'm going to remember how loud it was and how happy we were to sit in a silent car for 30 min afterwards, it's pretty crazy.   Our sushi arrived with a cute little flaming sugar cube on top of a cucumber slice which was very cool and unique, although we ordered a lot of sushi and they put it on every time so by the third plate, the novelty wears a bit thin. All that aside, I really think the saving grace of this place is the food. If my mouth doesn't mistake me they have fresh wasabi instead of the pre-packaged stuff and the food tasted very fresh. My udon tempura dish took a while to come out of the kitchen but when it did it was very flavorful, rich, and delicious. If I could review different parts of the experience I would say the sushi  and food is a 4/5 rather than a 3/5, but I'm reviewing the restaurant and not just the food.   The service was pretty great I must say, but it's kind of dampened when I have to yell my order at you and when you ask me things I almost have to resort to lip reading (yes it's like being at a concert almost). I'm nitpicking a little bit because it wasn't the services fault and I would actually give them a 4.5/5 because they were that good.   So you may be wondering why after claiming the food is great and the service even better I'm giving it 3 stars. Bear with me when I tell you that I will never go here on a weekend ever again. There are many sushi restaurants in the valley that are just as proficient and delicious without such a horrific ambience. If you're going alone to enjoy a quick meal you will -have- to sit at the sushi bar due to a rule posted on a sign in the front, and when you're sitting at a bar, with no alcohol, and everyone screaming around you, it really kind of ruins the experience.  If you're looking for a place to go during the week I might check it out again because the food and service is good, but all the other small details seem to have been missed when it comes to having a truly fulfilling and extraordinary sushi experience. If you're nearby, give it a go, but steel your nerves because it might test your patience to the limit.",

Then, once we were seated, it took almost 15 minutes more for someone to even take our order, so we didn't eat for more than an hour after we got there.    As I said, the food is very good (not the greatest I've ever had, but still good) ... but I'm not sure it's worth an hourlong wait to eat it.

I was actually planning on going to the new Pure on 7th St, but when I walked into Pure, the restaurant smelled overwhelmingly like bleach, so I left and went to Hana.   Hana, as always, did not disappoint. The food and the service here are consistently excellent. It was lunchtime, and they were busy, but turnover was pretty quick, and there was no wait time. There was also ample space in the parking lot.  I had the Hana Bento Box, which could easily have feed two people! You begin with miso soup and a small salad, and then the box arrives, overflowing with food. In the box is a delicious assortment of vegetables, an assortment of tempura vegetables and shrimp (the batter was so light and crispy and perfect, the vegetables were a wonderful assortment, and both the shrimp & the veggies were perfectly cooked), 6 pieces of different sashimi, a California roll, and a slice of orange. My only regret is that I didn't take a picture because it was phenomenal!  Thanks Hana--I'll be back!",

    "text": "We have previously been a big fan of Hana for quite awhile.  It  is close to our home in the Biltmore Area and we have always enjoyed the food - which is fresh, innovative, and unique...  However, we have had the same issue regarding customer service (seating policy) numerous times during our visits - and in our last visit on Thursday, it actually compelled us to finally walk out..... Almost of all our visits were just made up of my wife and I (party of two) and I think the strict seating policy of not ever giving a table of four to a party of two is ridiculous.  Now, I completely understand the desire to reserve larger tables for larger parties - I actually worked in several restaurants in my pre-professional phase of life in high school and college - but to blindly apply it across all circumstances like - in our case - when there is no one else waiting in the later part of the evening on a Thursday night is short-sighted and just plain dumb.  Here was our scenario: - We arrive around 7:30pm - one table available with four empty seats, and we are informed \"I'm sorry, we have to keep that open for larger parties..\" Larger, really?  A party of four does not exactly make a massive celebration... - We agree to wait to see if something else opens up. - While toting a very nice bottle of chilled white wine from home, we continue to wait.  No one comes by with an offer of glasses, a wine chiller, nothing.....  20 minutes goes by...  If you are going to stick with a goofy policy like this - at least make the effort to keep people happy.  How hard would it be to bring glasses, and ice bucket, and maybe even take an order for an appetizer??  Again, nothing .... - It's now almost 1/2 hour of waiting - close to 8pm - no one has left the restaurant nor has anyone come in either..  The empty table of four remains empty not earning the restaurant a dime in revenues or (most shockingly) the goodwill of a customer who really does want to patronize you... - Finally, a party of three shows up - that's three, not four...  Of course, they are seated immediately while we continue to wait.  - At that point, I tell the person seating guests that we're leaving and we walk out...   At this point, I'm done.  The service received was not only inept - but basically rude as well.  My recommendation: don't even consider this place if you are a couple looking for a nice dinner out.  I will not be back unless someone takes an active interest in fixing this issue going forward.  Plenty of other choices in the Camelback Corridor where one does not have to put up with that BS...",

Total bill was about $39 and some change.  The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is.   Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it.  Overall, it was an underwhelming and unsatisfying lunch.

So that's the good part but you must be wondering Hope why would you go to a restaurant to not eat food?! Crazy I know, but the food was just that awful we could not force it down ! I ordered a few rolls and asked for cream cheese to be added because I like the creamy taste mixed with flavorful fish .. Keyword is flavorful . This tasted like eating a stick of cream cheese wrapped in rice, nothing else had Any flavor !!   When I explained to the manager she tried to say well you added cream cheese and now you're complaining it tastes like cream cheese , fair point if there was nothing else in the roll, however a tiny amount of it should not completely over power everything else, don't blame the poor cream cheese dude, blame your lousy quality tasteless fish! We tried sashimi too and it literally had no taste on its own.   The pork Gyoza was the only thing that tasted normal .. Speaking of which we asked for spicy mayo and if you have had sushi anywhere you know it's pretty thin and spicy. This was just regular thick globby mayo with probably food coloring as it was not spicy at all!   Also their drinks were Flat and when I pointed it out I was told that's not possible it was just changed today !   Seriously you guys with broken taste buds stop leading us astray! Sushi station which is a revolving sushi bar tastes like 20x better than here, we went there after we left here since we only had a few bites each and were still hungry !",

But Hana has some of the best tasting dishes ANYWHERE; the Hamachi sashimi, tuna misoyaki, tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, dynamite shrimp and crab... I could go on and on - and the BYOB only adds to the experience. Be ready to wait, but its worth it.",

It's truly one of the best restaurants for fresh fish in the country. And it happens to be in Phoenix!  We had two giant plates of sashimi. I can recommend any of the fish. We didn't have any rolls but I am sure those are good as well.   Oh... Bring your own alcohol!! They don't serve any.",

Both times the service was excellent the girls that waited on us were fun and didn't mind that we wanted to sit and chat and we weren't in a rush to get back to work.    The sushi rolls were interesting, they have the standard rolls that all sushi places have (tuna, yellow tail, california, etc.) but their signature rolls were crazy, for example, the Volcano Roll - california roll draped in white fish and a spicy mayo sauce baked to perfection  What surprised me the most, I asked for gluten free soy sauce, not only did they have gluten free sauce but they had low sodium gluten free sauce!  Their prices are the same as any sushi place in town.  What sets them apart other than their great service and fun fish combos, its BYOB, I really need to remember that for next time and bring a bottle of wine.",

    "text": "Nice sushi. Small building. Not designed for large groups. I went with a group of 7, and had it not been a Wednesday night, I'm sure we would have had to wait a long time. As it was, we waited about 30 minutes, which I think is totally acceptable. Because it is small, and packed with people and tables, the place was very loud. It is also BYOB - so make sure you pack some!  About the food - we ordered A LOT. Appetizers, salads, soups, hot entrees, sashimi and a boat full of sushi. Everything was tasty. My only complaint was that all of the food arrived at once. We didn't have any room on our table to hold everything, and I would have preferred to eat in courses, even if they were ad-hoc courses.   I love the \"neighborhood hang out\" feel that Hana had. There were obviously many regulars, and it felt friendly and casual. If it was closer to my house, I would certainly return, but I don't think it is remarkable enough for a long drive (for those in the east valley).",

The diners who had brought their own beer/wine seemed to receive better service. All three of us ordered ice green tea and were surprised to receive cans instead of brewed. I honestly thought the waitress was surprised at us ordering it.  We ordered a variety of items, including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri. The sushi we had was very fresh, and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had. The rolls in general were a bit losely made, and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion: there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites, so it kind of ruined the concept of a \"roll\".  While nothing was bad per se, there wasn't really anything special that inspired me to want to return, and the prices were really high. I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants.  We didn't bother with deserts with Mary Coyle's Ice Cream Parlor being directly across the street.",

    "text": "This place is the DEAL. No kidding. THE DEAL.  First, there's the sushi.  I'm not a sushi snob, but I do like it fresh, melt in your mouth tasty and of course to not SMELL fishy. This place delivers. Every bite melts in your mouth like butter.  Like fish butter!  Which sounds gross, but just go with me here...  It's yummy yummy all around, no matter what you get.  I like the fancy rolls with all the stuff smushed in them, and this place has them all!  In addition, it's bring your own wine!  I love when I can just walk in a place with a bottle or two of wine and it's totally no big deal.  Plus it makes the whole night more cost effective (unless of course you purchase some faaaaancy wines).   The sushi is VERY reasonably priced, wonderful, you get it fast, and have I mentioned it is delicious?  Cause it is.  DELICIOUS.  You will get weak in the knees, I promise you.  The ONLY downside?  The place is unbelievably tiny.  So it fills up to capacity almost as soon as they open the doors.  My advice is to get there AS SOON AS THEY OPEN!  Telling you, I've gone there about five times, and the two times I got there RIGHT when they opened? I just walked right in and got a seat.  Every time I haven't gotten there right as they opened?  Had a LEAST a 45 minute wait.  Believe me, it's still worth it.  But as we are a society of unimaginably impatient people, make sure you get there right when they open!  You won't regret it.",

Most of their sushi on their menu are basic rolls.  It was a bit overpriced.  We prefer other sushi restaurants in the valley over Hana, we probably won't be back.",

The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.    We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!  My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.    This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.",

I love that when you walk in they yell out the traditional greeting.  It reminds me of Monsters Inc at Harry Hausens...  I know a kid at heart.  I enjoy being able to bring my own wine, sake or beer.  We ordered the pot stickers and the fired tofu as apps and I love their pot stickers.  It was a first for the fried tofu which was quite good.  Kind of like fried cheese... mmmmm.  There were a few uni shooters with some very pleased pallets and a few quail eggs shooters with the same happy taste buds around the table.  Mike had the Ebiyakisoba (shrimp noodles, I can't spell it to save my soul) which are tasty! There was a steak at the table and it was quite good.  And then the sushi!  We ordered the chefs choice $80 platter of sashimi then about the same amount in rolls.  The salmon was rich and buttery, the tuna succulent, the striped bass was excellent, I didn't get any of the scallops but everyone said they were great!  For the rolls we had the dragon roll, the shrimp tempura roll and I can't remember the last two rolls because the champagne and wine had started to take effect. All were wonderful!  One the downside the space REALLY needs an update... it has been a few years and the Ikea touches need to go.    I know in most Asian restaurants the food comes out when it comes out.  Meaning the hot dishes come out first, or your apps come out last and Hana is no different.  Unfortunately the waiter who used to get it and would put the orders in timing them so everything would actually show up when it was supposed to is now gone.  He is the cute Rock'a Billy dark haired gentleman over at Windsor. He will be missed if only because he understood and was proactive in making the experience great.  But knowing this is just how it is and expecting in advance helps.  Overall a great experience.  For 8 people the food and tip were right about $220 not bad for really good sushi!  It is a must if you like or love sushi!",

The menu offers a selection that's more authentic than typical American-inspired \"teriyaki chicken and rice\" styled eateries. First on my list is the sushi, which really might be the best in the Valley. Hanna opts for minalistic perfection, offering a variety of high quality, melt-in-your-mouth nigiri, and a few foundation rolls, the albacore being especially noteworthy. Secondly, the atmosphere is genuine, with a packed bistro and sushi bar or outdoor deck--yes, a deck! We ordered clams, octopus tempora, pork ramen, and a sashimi bento. I wasn't blown away by the ramen, but then the price didn't blow up our wallets either. Maybe I'm just not that into noodles. All other items were a smash hit.",

    "text": "\"Irashaimase!\" means Welcome! Traditionally, proprietors shout this to you as you walk in to their establishment in Japan and Hana is no exception.   As a Japanese native, I have very fond memories of how my food tasted while I was growing up. So far, there are only two restaurants I've tried in Arizona that have traditional sushi and dishes unique to Japanese home style cuisine. Hana is one of them.  Sushi is meant to be eaten in a single bite. Unlike most sushi restaurants in America, the chefs prepare the fish for nigiri sushi/sashimi thin and tender. This is how it is in Japan! Not the chunky block of fish you usually get. Sure, you feel like you are getting more value for your dollar but the whole idea around Japanese cuisine is balance, taste and esthetics. Too much fish overpowers the delicate flavor of the seasoned rice. Either way, their sushi is always fresh and delicious and creative. While cream cheese is not widely used in Japan, you can still get your Americanized sushi if you want it so you get a nice balance between authentic and neo-cuisine. I highly recommend any of their nigiri options (slice of fish on top of a bite of seasoned rice). We've tried a few of their rolls too and were not disappointed.  My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu Ramen. It is sort of off-menu; you have to request it. And it is amazing. The broth is a rich pork broth, made from boiling pork bones for literally hours and hours. The noodles are tender with a wonderful chewy-ness to them and the garnishments are wonderful. Takes me back to my childhood, slurping soup out of the bowl from a tiny shoppe in an alley, steaming my face in the rich aroma of pork. A recent trip to Japan reminded me of just how much I love that dish and Hana does it up right. In fact, they've won awards for their Ramen! Best in Arizona!  They also have some of the best Tempura available! Tender, light and delicious. I have yet to have a greasy tempura dish set before me from Hana. Try their Agedashi Tofu - Tofu squares battered, deep fried and then served with a light tempura sauce poured over. The batter turns gummy (in the best possible way), the tofu is piping hot (as in, be careful!) and the flavor is delicate and comforting. Oh! And the Hamachi Kama (this is the collar of the Yellowtail fish) is out of this world. Broiled perfectly so that the meat has a nice char but is still tender and moist. Served with a traditional ponzu (soy-citrus) sauce. YUM! (I'm making myself hungry!)  Other traditional Japanese dishes are offered from their \"Japanese Menu\". It isn't always handed to you at the table. Sometimes you have to ask for it. Most of the items found on this menu are visible on the chalkboard above the sushi bar too. Be sure to try them! They're terrific. I recommend the Takoyaki (little balls of seasoned dumpling, stuffed with cooked octopus and then topped with Kewpie Mayonnaise and other delicious toppings) and the cold soba (cold buckwheat noodles that you dip in a subtle soy/ponzu sauce.) Wonderful in Summer and surprisingly hearty for such a light dish!. Their main dinner menu features steak, chicken and lobster prepared in their own Hana style. It's pretty yummy but I admit that I tend to stick to the more traditional stuff. Price-wise, they are within the typical range for a Japanese eatery. My husband and I typically spend around $50-60 for dinner but he eats a LOT of sushi so...  The staff is always friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. The place really has good food so don't be surprised if there is a wait. It is a small place (they are expanding soon) so there are a limited number of tables. But they turn their tables around rather quickly so typically your wait is not longer than 30-40 minutes on a very busy Friday evening.  This is a BYOB establishment. You bring your beer, sake or wine and they'll uncork it for you and provide fresh glasses. My only complaint (and this is entirely a ME thing) is that it can get rather loud in there. I'm accustomed to the quiet atmosphere you find in Japan but not at Hana. I'm sure it is just because so many people are talking so enthusiastically about how delicious the food is!   Footnote: My daughter is deathly allergic to shellfish but loves sushi. I like that this restaurant routinely asks about food allergies every time we order and they are careful to keep shellfish well away from her order so we can all enjoy without having to worry if we'll have to cart her to the ER!",

    "text": "This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)  The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.  The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.  They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.  They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.  The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.  If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!  Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.  FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.",

    "text": "Took my dad here when he was in town.  He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him!  We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by.  Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat.  They were correct.   It was almost hard to find a spot to park.  The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed.  They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5.  The hostess was very nice and polite.  The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian.  (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of \"Americanization of the food\").  The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it.  All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes.  There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children.    We ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc.  The edamame came out cold - never had cold before.  When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy.  All the food was good, not exceptional.  The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had.  We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less.  Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out...  Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again.  If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a try.",

For future reference, it's better to eat a little later to cut that wait time.  Food was amazing and can't wait to come back again soon!  Great fresh sushi - and tempura that was done very well - not greasy at all!  Good job Hana!",

I also ordered the Ramen and it had an unpleasant barnyard flavor that I'm not sure was supposed to be there, but was unwelcome. I was glad that everybody else was almost done eating when it came out because I would hate to be the one who ruined everybody else's otherwise pleasant dining experience. If you're looking for a romantic night out, this is not the place to go. It's so loud, you'll be yelling at each other and repeating yourself all night.",

The sushi is always top notch and ever since my husband and first dined at that sushi bar, we haven't been to any other japanese restaurant.  Why would we??    We get ridiculously excited when we find someone who hasn't heard of Hana's (getting tougher since it's fame isn't so hidden) and we quickly take them out!  BYOB is awesome!  I'd say it helps us save a little bit of cash, but that extra cash just ends up being spent on more SUSHI!  That or the great staff!  Anywhere else I my \"complain\" about the minimum seating, but here it makes you feel like you are in a dear friends dining room.    During our 1 year anniversary dinner we splurged big time and now I am ADDICTED to the Hana Pride roll.  It's everything good in this world all on one plate. YUM!  Thank you, Hanas, for always welcoming us into your kitchen and letting us peek over the counters as you masterfully create meals that warm our hearts!   -The Larsons",

Alcohol is BYOB as they do not have a liquor license.  It can get somewhat noisy form conversation, but they do not play loud music like some other places in the valley like 'Ra'.   Their tako salad is wonderful, the best I've had since Zen32 closed. Tuna Tataki is also outstanding.  UPDATE: They expanded and are quite a big larger, but still not very big. The new room is quieter and easier to carry on a conversation in.",

    "text": "When I go to a sushi restaurant, I look to make sure they follow the rules below:  1- Must have fresh wasabi. The paste you mix with soy sauce to your desired level of brown is great and all, but real, fresh wasabi is much much better. It has a biting taste, and not something you want to dollop on your rolls. It opens your sinuses right up, but in an awesome way. Best thing about Hana? It was free, and it kept coming!  2 - Limited American roll selection. If you like your Las Vegas rolls, good for you. I however like my raw fish, and my simple sashimi, sushi, and rolls. Hana has a very purposeful menu that sticks to the good stuff.  3 - Decor. Hana is tiny. Probably seats 40 on a good day. Very clean and modern feel inside though. No obtrusive posters or ads, all food (dinner and sushi) are made right there behind the bar.  Price was, Hana is a bit on the higher side, but you are paying for the quality and the service. Service was wonderful.  I ended up getting the Miso Soup to start (delicious), squid salad, Alaska roll, and an oyster shooter (best part of my meal).  This place is BYOB, so there is that. They also asked me about any allergies at the very beginning of the meal, which was kinda great (and would be even awesomer for someone who actually has any allergies),  Overall, is this a place you go weekly? No, not unless you are made of money. However, special occasions, dates, celebrations with a small group of friends? For sure!",

    "text": "I've been eyeing Hana Japanese Eatery for a while now as I have dined at the French Market that is diagonally across the street. If you haven't gone there you really should, but this is supposed to be a review of Hana Japanese Eatery. As I said I've been wanting to come here for a while, and tonight I said to my wife that this is where we are going for dinner. We got there a little after 6 and got a seat right away. We had a seat by the door so I was able to hear them tell people there would be a little wait. It was about 7. They have a rule about parties of 2. They will not seat you at a table meant for 4 or more, so that is why several parties of 2 had a slight wait. This is a small place with a small outside patio to match. The staff are very friendly welcoming you as you enter. This is a high energy place, at least it was tonight. Serving staff are moving about quickly, orders are being called out by the head chef to the sue chefs and announcing orders that are ready and for what table to the wait staff. I want you to understand this is not a criticism, it is one thing I really liked about the place. All around the sounds of people talking, having a good time, mixed in with the calling of orders etc. just made me love this place more. And even though the energy vibe was high, at no time did we feel rushed. My wife and I stayed for over an hour, and when we left we were wished a good evening and encouraged to come back soon. And I will definitely be coming back soon because of the food. A great menu of small plates and entree's that are carefully crafted. The fish doesn't get any fresher than this. Yes, fresh fish in AZ. Presentation is equally well done. When I asked the person serving me questions she was very happy to explain what it was and the best way to eat it.  There is so much more my wife and I want to try. Some other things you should know. This is a BYOB place. People were coming with their six packs of beer, bottles of wine, etc. They have a fridge to put your extra beers or bottles of wine to keep them cold until you need it. Also, no corking fee. They really just want you to come and have a great time. And we did. Oh, and as we drove up I saw in their front window a poster that said \"We Support Red For Ed\". As a K-8 Social Emotional Learning Specialist, I appreciate their support. So if you are a teacher or support staff you should bring yourself here to support them. And if you are not, you should eat here anyway.",

    "text": "A bit of good and bad all around -- expensive in comparison, but authentic Japanese food. Huge portions. Wifey has a tiny stomach capacity so we brought much of it home.  She took a very long time to decide due to the high prices, and we almost left, when she decided on the ribeye. A good choice, the steak was amazing and full of awesome flavor.  Though a bento box or a few rolls would have been nice, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was good with lots of delightful goodies in the broth.  For drinks, though they don't serve alcohol you can BYOB. I asked for hot tea, and got a can of green tea soda and cup of ice.  I ordered seaweed salad, and was brought a lettuce side salad followed by the one I ordered.   Next an oyster shooter. It was $9 for one presented in a small dark bowl which arrived the same time as the main course, I paused a bit, being used to seeing them viewable in a clear shot glass. Nevertheless it was tasty.  On to the service: Before entering the restaurant we were greeted then seated quickly. Parking was surprisingly plentiful given the small lot, we lucked out and got a place near the door. Quite attentive wait and sushibar staff, all appropriate pleasantries spoken in Japanese, respectful and honoring us.  Though the room temperature was uncomfortably hot, overall nice experience.  We're on a budget so could not splurge on things we really wanted to try. Would return again at a less busy time with lower prices and less heat.",

I made sure to order a wide variety of items to make sure I captured the gist what they were putting down.  First up: Miso Soup Very good flavor lots of seaweed, tofu, and seasonings. 2nd: Tuna Tartare Thinly sliced, a little smokiness, a little acidity but a bit disappointing overall.  It was lacking the pop I look for in this dish. 3rd: Octopus balls These were interesting.  Deep fried octopus with some mayo and a light sauce.  Good flavor but the cold middle just didn't work for my palate at all. 4th: Shrimp and Veggie tempura Perfectly breaded tempura.  Light crisp and tasteful.  Only knock was the dipping sauce was too simple and plain 5th: Phili Roll It's hard to make a really bad or really good Phili roll.  This was just as good as any in my book. 6th: Tuna sashimi Unimpressed with the freshness, mouthfeel, and color.  Expected much better pieces from such a highly regarded sushi joint.  Hana has a good ambiance.  Service started out good but kind of faded midway thru.  The price was average to high for the fare.   I understand lots of people love them and as much as I wanted to be in on that love fest I'm just not one of them and I am okay with that.  As overall both visits were just okay for me.  Wasn't great...wasn't bad...just really okay.  It is hard to see me giving them a third chance unless I am really craving ok sushi...",

We both wanted a cocktail but forgot they were BYO.  My friend went across the street and got beer and sake.  We made sake bombs and they were fantastic!  Between us, we ordered yellowtail sashimi, yellowtail roll, tempura vegetables, and a salmonskin roll.  The fish was great, really fresh tasting. The ratio of rice to sushi was perfect.  I was glad to see that they have added outdoor seating.  This offers another option for diners who want to enjoy the weather and a much quieter dining experience.  The best part of the evening was getting the check!  We ate well for under $50, an amazing feat for ANY meal, let alone sushi.  I will definitely be returning soon....good thing they're in the neighborhood!",

Drinks:  BYOB, so not much else to say.  The water was served in plastic as you'd expect in a reasonably priced place, but the water was fresh and didn't taste like tap.  Food:  Pork bone ramen.  The broth was delicious and the noodles were tender but didn't fall apart , you had to chew or slurp the whole noodle.  I recommend getting the soft boiled egg with it because the yolk makes the broth fairly rich which I like.  Sushi.  The salmon nigiri was buttery and fresh and the rice was good, not dry.  Those were the standouts.  We also had the Hana roll (deep fried goodness) and spicy tuna which were both good but not stand-out.  Service:  We were greeted at the door by a friendly guy with a cool haircut who advised a table would be ready soon.  After about 30 seconds he apologized and said the table was not available but that there were two seats for me and my girl at the bar.  I prefer the sushi bar anyway so no issue.  Server.  After seating we were greeted by our server who was friendly and gave us a moment to decide the order.  She recommended the pork bone over the miso ramen which turned out to be great advise.  Over the course of the meal she returned frequently to quickly check in, then let us return to our conversation.  We were served by her as well as the sushi chef handing the nigiri and rolls directly to us which was cool.  Staff was constantly circling the tables taking empty plates and it was a bit loud when chef and servers would talk shop, but felt necessary to keep the place moving at a good pace and it added to the ambiance which felt alive and fun, almost exciting to sit and watch.  Takeaway: Get the pork bone ramen and bring a bottle of white wine for a nice date at a good price.",

I know, it sounds absurd, but weather doesn't exactly dictate my choice for fuel. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, and buy did I make a good choice. The ramen came with a side salad, and for $2 more, you could add a soft boiled egg. The flavor of the broth was bold but not overwhelming. The ramen noodles were not too soft, and not too hard.. They were cooked just right! The portion was also quite generous, as I was completely stuffed after finishing the bowl. The pieces of sliced pork were thick and tender, with a hint of sweetness. The service was also on point. My water cup was never empty, and my table never filled with finished dishes. I'm excited to come back to try the sushi there.. Maybe next time when I'm not overly stuffed.",

Besides the great food and service, we also love the no-corkage BYOB. We usually bring a white wine, and they make sure to put it in an ice bucket for us.  Hana has a good variety of well executed classics and lots of unique specials. The Hana tamago was recently featured in the Republic's food section with good reason. It's a really cool dish featuring a tempura battered soft boiled egg set on top of a delicious creamy sauce. Get it and don't share! I also had the heirloom tomato sashimi a few months ago and loved it. As a vegetarian, it's great to see a sushi chef's attention to detail extended to veggies as well.  My husband is the meat eater in the family so he has got to enjoy some awesome seafood dishes. Most recently, he had a beautiful looking lobster dish (his favorite of the night) and an entire grilled squid. He also had high praises for a tuna roll topped with fried garlic as well.  We are really looking forward to coming back with friends and family so we can share Hana's goodness.",

Just walking distance across the intersection is a French grocery store that sells wine, sake, and Japanese beer. For appetizers we got the agedashi tofu (not too salty but very hot!), miso Ramen without butaniku (for meat avoiders!), and for nigiri sushi we got halibut, yellow tail, scallop, and albacore. As far as the fish goes my favorite was the halibut - very succulent! I do recommend getting some add ons for the Ramen because it's just noodle, broth, and a couple naruto otherwise. But, the broth was flavorful and the noodles weren't overdone or undercooked. Also, as soon as we sat down we were offered a couple bites of poki nacho...like a True izakaya serving otsumami (finger food)! I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for a some what un-americanized Japanese restaurant with good sushi grade fish. *Side note, the rolls didn't look particularly exciting but we were full with our 1 app, 1 entree, and 6 pieces of nigiri.

The waitress is very nice and attentive and polite. The best Japanese restautant so far in Phoenix.",

Waiter just plunked all our checks in middle of table and we had to figure out who they belonged to.  Checks were handwritten and confusing.  Made a $2 error in their favor on my check which I called to their attention.  I also did notice that when they include the gratuity they are basing it on the total which includes the tax.  This is not right. It is not the amount it is the principle.e noise.    I opted for an appetizer of sliced pork in order to avoid the fried as well as the high carb foods.  This was just average in taste.  They do not take reservations but this could be due to the size and number of tables.  Would not recommend for groups over 4.",

    "text": "Yesterday I was seeking out a sushi bar in our quest to locate the best sushi in Phoenix, and this place looked promising.  They had chefs who will make something interesting for you, and that is what I really like in a good sushi restaurant.  When we walked in and looked at the menu, it looked decent.  They had ankimo, so of course we got that.  We also ordered some scallops, red snapper, spanish mackerel with deep-fried body, a baked salmon roll, some uni shooters, the carpaccio, and we also told them to just make us something interesting.  We started out with miso soup.  It was pretty typical.  The carpaccio set the tone for the rest of the meal - on paper, stips of red snapper, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with a cucumber garnish and fresh wasabi should be awesome.  But it was missing something.  It was kind of bland.  The carpaccio we had last week was one of the highlights; this time it was boring.  If you have read any of my other recent sushi reviews, you'd know that one of my new favorite dishes is ankimo (or steamed monkfish liver).  The ankimo they served us happens to be the first ankimo I didn't like.  For some reason it tasted bland, and it was even a different color and texture than other ankimo I had.  I suspect this was overcooked.  They also brought us the ankimo sliders for good measure (hopefully they didn't charge us for this, because we didn't ask for it), and they were decent, but not mind-blowing.  The waitress told us people usually bite the lemon it is served on in order to balance it out; my friend tried that and said it totally ruined it.  Makes sense, as the slider has a lot of delicate flavors, and lemon is not delicate at all.  The sushi (red snapper, scallop, Spanish mackerel) was pretty typical.  I did like the deep fried Spanish mackerel body.  The fish itself had very little meat, though.  I've had Spanish mackerel with twice as much meat (see: Yama Sushi in Portland).  The baked salmon roll was a terrible idea.  I knew the idea of a cooked roll would not really appeal to me... But I was open to it.  I like to let other people order things they want, too, you know... But neither of us cared for it.  We think it actually had cheese on it.  Yes, cheese, on a seafood dish.  I would totally back legislation that made combining fish and yellow cheeses illegal.  The uni shooters epitomized this place.  It was an idea that sounded really, really awesome on paper, but was poorly executed.  You see, the uni shooter contains an oyster, a piece of uni, and a raw quail egg.  Sounds awesome, right?  Of course it does.  But it also had a sauce that was so strong that it completely masked the flavor of the things I actually wanted to taste.  The oyster could still be noticed, but the quail egg was barely detectable, and the uni might as well have been left out.  Uni is delicate, and should not be served with strong flavors.  Without the sauce, it would've been perfect.  I actually enjoyed the special item the chef made us.  It was described to us (by who I believe may have been the owner) as a Japanese comfort food.  Basically, it was a small stew/soup thing with eggs, uni, and a couple other things in it.  It really was unique, and I haven't had anything else quite like it.  Finally, the dessert menu contained one item I got really excited about: tempura ice cream.  It has been about nine years since I had the dish in Kingston, NY, so, of course, I had to order it.  Unfortunately, instead of one big scoop of ice cream, it was served in three small scoops, so all but a little ball of ice cream from each scoop was melted.  It was basically tempura soaked in cream.  Again, great idea, poor execution.  This is a place I want to like, because the owner does have some creativity, and probably cares about the cuisine.  It's definitely not generic, and that's definitely worth something.  But compared to the meal we had last week, it paled in comparison.  It was inferior in every single respect, and our bill was actually larger!  In Phoenix, you can't charge $90/person after tip and expect repeat business, unless the entire experience is spectacular.  Because there are places that provide that at that price point.",

We had the volcano roll (white fish), spicy tuna, Hana roll and my favorite off the menu item, chirachi bowl which has white fish, tuna, salmon, octopus, scallops and more over white rice. It is not cheap but worth every penny!! Love this place!!!",

The sushi tasted fresh with just the right amount of sauce.  My dad got a yakisoba dish and it was also very good. The veggies were so fresh and had a little crunch to them. I will be having some great leftovers. I take off 1 star only because their sushi selection seems a little short.

While its a small place with maybe 10 tables and bar seating, it is packed with fresh flavors.  We sat at the bar last night and while we were waiting, the sushi chef handed us a plate. It was a cucumber/crab salad on a fried wonton crisp. We ordered a bowl of their tempura udon, the Hana roll, the tempura shrimp roll, the spicy tuna roll and the squid salad.   The udon broth was seasoned perfectly and a great compliment to the tempura battered veggies and shrimp.  The squid salad was tender, lightly seasoned and full of textures. A must-try.   This is the only place that actually makes the spicy tuna roll spicy.   The food/fish is fresh and the staff is uber-friendly. I like coming here for good sushi, especially since most of Phoenix/Scottsdale usually is full of trendy or not-so-good sushi places.",

    "text": "Why does this place have a good reputation? In my three visits over multiple years I've never been impressed at all. The fish is not especially fresh or attractive, the rice is hard and not all that tasty, the service is chaotic. I want to like this place. I really do. But it's not nearly as good as Harumi or Yasu or Hiro.   The bright points were the green tea (best I've had in a long time) and the spicy tuna roll, which was very good. But the salmon skin hand roll was a disaster. Nothing about it was good. Instead of crispy salmon skin you get what I'll call salmon scrapings, meaty, but not in a good way. And there are these strong-tasting vegetables in there that are totally out of place and quite sad. The nigiri was kind of okay. Nothing at all special about the proteins, and the rice balls are dense and hard without that tangy vinegar flavor I expect. I've had bad tamago maybe once before in my life, and this tamago was maybe the worst. Ice cold, falling apart, and just not the right flavor. The eel was rather disappointing too, and I rarely feel that way about eel anywhere. The best protein was probably the scallop, but that isn't saying much. Salmon was disappointing too. Especially after the sensational salmon we've enjoyed at Hiro the last couple of visits.   Our server was enthusiastic and pleasant, but everything came at the wrong time. Our so-so tempura appetizer came out about 10 minutes after the sushi, and the soups we ordered never came at all. At least they didn't try to charge us for them.   I won't be back. There's much better sushi to be had nearby.",

    "text": "I have found my new favorite sushi spot.  I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.  You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.   On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.  The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. \"Hey, fire!\" I thought. It was a nice touch.  Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.  Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.   The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.",

    "text": "Pretty darn good. Tiny little place.  Really tiny.  The party of 14 waiting in front of me was surprised by the length of their wait time and left, but I mean what did they expect? In order to accommodate a party of 14 the place would have to pretty much clear out entirely. During dinner rush on a Saturday that might take a second. So, walking in and seeing they size, I imagined I too would have a bit of a wait. I put my name down but the hostess had no idea how long the wait would be, she simply told me there were \"a lot of parties ahead of you\". So, that was helpful. In any case we were there and wanted sushi, so we were in.  It gave the fellas of my party time to run to the store to buy some wine as the joint is BYOB.  I actually thought that was pretty cool, I like it.   We ended up waiting about an hour.  When we were seated our server was a little short with us.  She was busy.  So far this sounds like a 2 star review, amirite? But then we ordered.  First off, I really like that they offer so many non-sushi dishes.  My husband ALWAYS wants sushi, and sometimes I'm just not diggin' it, Hana's got me covered.  The Yasai Yakisoba was really good, the noodles had a nice gingery bite, the whole table enjoyed bites.  I've got my eye on the ramen for next time. We ordered a variety of sushi.  It all came in a wooden boat, a member of our party sang a bit of Andy Samberg's 'on a boat'' there were laughs, thanks wine.  There was a sugar cube on fire too, boy's love stuff on fire so half the table was really impressed. Every thing tasted fresh, and these are not the dime sized rolls that places like Sushi Brokers tries to pass off as sushi.  The only thing we weren't super impressed with was the baked scallop special, it tasted like sweet baby ray's bar-b-q sauce... not great.    So basically service needs work, sushi is good, fresh, and a fair size, and the noodles are bomb.",

Maybe this is a one off but it was a horrendous experience: I called ahead for pick up- though I had given enough time they were still very late (talking 25 minutes real time here) getting it to me. I drove home realized they had given me the wrong order so I went back, the manager wanted the Ngiri I was given by mistake back, to give to another person after it had been in my possession for a good 40 minutes. Gave it back of course, just thought it's weird. And guess what they made me wait another 20 minutes even though I had called when I got home and realized it was the wrong order.
