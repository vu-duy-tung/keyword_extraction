    "text": "Found this place on Yelp and I was pretty excited to know that they have Shaved Snow and Boba, but just found out that shaved snow is only available on Summer, and didn't get to try their Boba drinks neither, because part of the restaurant was out of electricity due to stolen electric wires, so they are not able to make cold drinks and desserts for few more days.  We were there around 5pm Monday, only a couple of tables occupied. We ordered #24 Eye Round Steak & Shrimp Pho, and #31 Beef Meatball & Shrimp Pho, $7.99 each, both taste OK, not the best but not bad at all.  There are 4 shrimps in each Pho, shrimps tasted FRESH, that's so important!  I ordered more noodles to my Pho for $2 extra and that was really a lot of noodles, satisfied with the quantity.   The price for each item is a dollar or two higher than the two Pho places where we used to go, but acceptable because this place seems clean and neat, friendly customer service, and the quantity of food is ok. Will be back to try other items and desserts for sure!",

    "text": "The ORIGINAL OWNERS just SOLD the place 1-2 months ago!!! It's under NEW OWNERSHIP and they are not Vietnamese. New waiters, new staff. You may still see the original owner there from time to time to help the new owners with the transition. You will also see some of the older waiters. They will be helping out for another 6 months to 1 year.  Been going here for over 2 years regularly. Loved getting the 'Bun Bo Hue' dish... I'm actually crazy about 'Bun Bo Hue'. My husband loved getting 'Pho Bo Vien' (Pho with meatballs). And we both loved the rice plates.   Ever since the new ownership, some of the food are not consistent and not as great. For instance, the 'Bun Bo Hue' tastes different.. still decent.. but not great... and just different overall. I used to think no one here in Phoenix can have superior 'Bun Bo Hue'... but I have finally found a place that does (restaurant is called \"PT Noodles\" in Avondale, AZ... rice is great there though... anyway... that's a different review). The Pho here is still good though!!  Some of the rice entrees have changed as well. Sometimes, the meat is prepared differently.  Never liked the Snow or boba here. They are stingy on the toppings. Go elsewhere for those products (I recommend \"Snoh Ice Shavery\" in central Phoenix)  The waiters need more training on how to be good waiters. Otherwise, they are actually really nice people.",

Normally pho restaurants don't charge for meaningless side dishes, but I guess I should've tried their boba to make my experience more worthwhile.",

    "text": "I've been to Pho Avina three times already, and each time it's progressively worse.  Especially as I start tasting other Vietnamese restaurants around the valley.  I ordered just a regular pho with beef shanks, and spring rolls.  Both of the dishes were very mediocre.  Lets start with the side vegetable dish they give you; I barely got anything.  Just a small clump of bean sprouts, a small twig of basil, a lime, and that's pretty much it.  It's just not enough for one person.  The beef broth tasted odd to me as well.  It does not taste like 2 year old continuously boiled broth, and there is a strange tang to it.  It might appease some others though.  The spring rolls was also disappointing.  There was two tiny shrimps and barely any peanut sauce!.  Three shrimp minimum is my rule for spring rolls.    Finally ordered a boba for kicks, and all I have to say for that is yuck.  I couldn't even finish it.  It was too sweet, and milky.  It tasted like they just poured a can of condensed milk into the tea and called it a day.  Their Three Colored Drink was equally bad.  The red bean was hard and undercooked.  Furthermore, there was barely any jelly in there!    The worst part?  It's pretty expensive for pho, and isn't worth the price.  They're lucky they have a monopoly there especially with Pho 35 closing down.  Place Pho Avina in a city with tons of Vietnamese restaurants and it'll go the way of the dodo.",

I went with the Egg Noodle soup which some would argue isn't True Pho but I say boo to that!  The spring rolls were great as well. They weren't too sticky and had plenty of meat inside them. The service here was great as well, what nice people. The lunch crowd was huge but they still provided very quick service and were attentive on refilling my drink anytime it was empty. I have a feeling I will be a regular here real quick!",

Based on the limited universe of Vietnamese restaurants I've tried, Pho Avina is the best, and has been so consistently.     Despite an enviably consistent business, the dining area is always clean but for any tables just vacated.  The food has been consistently excellent, the portions adequate or better, the presentation/appearance appealing,  the service always decent or better and the prices remarkable in a totally positive way.  An added bonus is the extensive boba drink menu, and the addition of a remarkable variety of Taiwanese shaved ice dessert combinations, always artfully presented.  These aren't the snow-cones most of us grew up with, and at about $4 and up, they should be something special, and though they may be old news to Taiwanese  and west coast Asian folk, it's a new-to-me delight in beautiful, ultra-light, cold dessert that I highly recommend.   If it's a little less appealing as AZ veers in and out of what passes for cold weather, have a hot pho first, and enjoy.  I don't think you can go wrong with either.",

No boba again and I also got cold soup and hard noodles. Server NEVER CHECKED ON US. Not once. Also took forty minutes to get our food that wasn't even cooked properly. Forgot our take out orders so we had to wait another fifteen minutes after already waiting thirty assuming they had remembered. We had to go to the counter to ask about it.

It is hands-down the best version of this I have ever had. The broth is so flavorful I dream about it. It is incredibly complex and it's hard to pinpoint what flavors are in there, but you won't care, you'll be too busy eating the bathtub sized bowl of heaven.   Also amazing are the grilled meats, especially the shrimp. They have a delicious sauce on them and taste smokey from the grill. Awesome on the rice platter or in the \"roll your own\" spring rolls (a very light and healthy way to enjoy Vietnamese!)  Also of note are the rice flower crepe (allow a few extra minutes for this one if you are in a lunch rush) and the fantastic creamy curry (chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu). The entree comes with rice, BUT if you order it off the \"sandwich\" menu, you'll get a smaller portion (the regular is huge) surrounded by warm crusty french bread. To. Die. For. Not spicy but full of flavor and the creamy taste of coconut milk.  They can get pretty busy at times and occasionally the service is a bit slow, waiting to check out etc, but not always and it's worth the wait. Just ask for your check a little early and don't be afraid to flag down a server. They are all VERY friendly.",

I clearly ordered something that's 10 bucks on their menu, but on my way out, they charged me almost 17 bucks. I pointed it out when i received my check, the waiter was pretty nice and apologized, however, the old lady, who i assume is the manager/owner? was extremely rude. She literally told me, and i'm quoting \"you ate it and you have to pay for it, you don't have to come back in the future\". Seriously? This is like the worst customer service i have ever experienced.  Then she kept saying something about a \"price change\" which makes no sense because if there was a price change, why was not shown on the menu?? I insisted on paying just the 10 bucks because that is the price i saw when i ordered my food. I wish i can give this place zero stars, the old lady was not only unprofessional, but straight up rude. Although the waiter was a pretty cool dude, but still, there will be no chance of me returning to this place ever again.",

My wife and I have been here more then just a few places and every time it is great.  I don't know how many times a week my wife is craving some of their pho.  This place definitely has a lot more to offer then just pho.  Between my wife and I, we have probably tried all the pho's on the menu.  The chicken and the beef are always are go to soups.  If you are feeling a little adventurous there are some more exotic meats you can try in your soup though, too.  Last time I was there I tried one of their other soups, it was a spicey beef soup.  It normal comes with the tendons, but I went ahead and skipped those this time.  it was fantastic.  It wasn't the usual rice noodles that you get in pho, which was a great change.  It was a giant spicey bowl of deliciousness.  While we haven't got much here other than soup, we have tried some of the appetizers and some of the Banh mis.  They were good also.  The Banh mis are pretty tasty.  Some are better than others, for my taste. If you go you'll just have to try a couple and see which ones you like best.  Don't worry, it will be enjoyable.    With all these praises, you may be asking why I'm only giving it four stars.  That would be a good question indeed.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the quality of the meat.  From time to time, some of the meat is little bit fattier and a little bit more grisly then I would like.  I understand that this meat selection is a huge part of what makes the broth taste so amazing, but It's my only real complaint about this place.",

I have eaten at several Pho stops around town (check my reviews) and this has got to be my least favority of the bunch so far.   Started with the egg rolls which were just deep friend and essentially flavorless. Ordered up our Pho Tai, and there was little meat to speak of. I mean, my homeboy had four gigantic bites and was digging for additional beef to no avail. The broth in the Pho (a much overlooked aspect of Pho) was really not great and the noodles were just OK. We ordered up a limeade to go with our meal and it was super sugary and not that appealing. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the check, but cheap Pho is not hard to come by anyway so.....   I don't plan on coming back to Avina ever, especially when I've got Maxim closer to home....",

    "text": "I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!  At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always \"something Asian\". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us.   So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word \"pho\" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me.   Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be \"out\" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.  Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say \"excuse me\" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.  We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell \"cheeseburger\" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills.   I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school \"beef and rice noodle\" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.  The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in.   I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.  The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.  I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact \"snow bubble milk tea\" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the \"McDonald's Choke\" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.  [Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted. Yay self-censoring!]",

    "text": "Simply the best. I'm pretty much in love with this tiny, hole in the wall Vietnamese stop.  In a small strip mall near ASU West, not many other Vietnamese places can compare in my opinion. For those of you who love Cyclo, I'm convinced it's b/c of Cyclo's cute interior vibe. It shocks me they consistently win so many Valley awards. Pho Avina is 100 times better, 50% cheaper, and has about 10 more offerings of pho than Cyclo....among many other things.  Ok enough of comparing...I would highly recommend one of their Banh mi (traditional Vietnamese sandwich). They have the specialty bread delivered daily from a local bakery, so these disappear FAST! The yummy pate is truly what makes this delish. Being from WA, these sandwiches usually aren't hard to find, but I've noticed in AZ it's a lot trickier to locate em.  The best pho ever, consisting of a large portion. Pho Avina also has great appetizers...I haven't had too many of the entrees b/c usually when I go, I'm craving pho. Lastly, they have a good selection of Boba (tapioca) flavors (I personally prefer mango) and desserts....oh and don't forget the Thai Iced Tea...a must here!  Friendly friendly service, everytime we go we are greeted by the owner, who couldn't get any cuter....Please try!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azcentral.com%2Fent%2Fdining%2Farticles%2F0613phoavina.html&s=e877095d66e953ec5992e9dd9c27bbc1ab3b932fa6075d4f123acc92c6d83c98\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azcentral.com/ent/dining...</a>",

I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, and have tried some pretty phenomenal places throughout my travels, but hands down, Avina is a gem, although I don't think its that big of a secret considering the amount of patrons that constantly occupy the place.   The perfect combo...  1.) BI CUN - shredded pork spring rolls 2.) PH TOM C BT - Beef & Shrimp  + Sriracha & Hoison hot sauces to top everything off because I love my Pho SPICY!!! 3.) Coffee Boba (amazing amazing flavor)  They also provide you with the necessary sprouts, mint leaves & lime, of course..  I think I'm in love.",

While I won't review it each time I come here, I skipped reviewing the last 2 or 3 visits. I love this place...it loves me back.  Owner not there today, service spot on and food, well I keep trying something new each time and each time a touchdown. Every table in the place occupied. Every time I have been there, it's been SRO. I don't think that this place is a secret.  Besides the egg rolls (hard to skip this and I just don't love sweet potatoes), today I went for the BUN REU, blue crab meat, eggs, tomato and vermicelli noodles in a chicken broth...and of course a mango boba.  All of my previous forays into Vietnamese have been rice noodles and reading other reviews about pho induced coma's seemed silly to me. Well, this wasn't a pho but 30 minutes later I just wanted to curl up and go to bed - I think the vermicelli had something to do with that.  I love the fact that I could meet Scott W there, the same service, similar food (he had the beef/shrimp pho) and he gives it 3 stars and I give it 5. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I should have told him that he could get wooden disposable chopsticks instead of the nice round plastic chopsticks and perhaps he would have given it 4 stars...",

    "text": "Every culture has their comfort soup.  American's have chicken noodle, Mexican's have menudo and Vietnamese have pho.  I must have been Vietnamese in a past life.   Pho is the national dish of Vietnam and a staple at any Vietnamese restaurant and Pho Avina has some of the best pho around.  Let me warn you - this isn't an appetizer, this is a meal.  A big, steaming bowl of soup served with your choice of meat and noodles in a savory, almost sweet, broth.  The pho is served with a large plate of fresh basil, cilantro and bean sprouts; the cilantro complimented the soup nicely.  I chose the chicken and shrimp and was pleasantly surprised with large shrimp and big chunks of all white chicken.   My eyes were bigger than my stomach, so I also ordered the deluxe vermicelli salad.  A salad of noodles, veggies, beef, chicken, shrimp, eggroll, sweet potato cake and fish sauce - toss together and enjoy.  I had it boxed up, but did nibble on a few items and the sweet potato cake is out of this world good.   I had come for the banh mi at the recommendation of a previous yelper.  They only serve the sandwiches Monday-Friday from 11-3; I had just missed them.  Darn.  I will definitely be back to try the banh mi and a boba, there were soooo many delicious flavors to choose from except for the fresh durian - icky, icky, icky.",

Last night brought in one of the worst storms in 17 years, but I braved the rain to get out and have a big bowl of noodles at Pho Avina.  Pho Avina is a family-run operation where they greet you cheerfully and remember your order if you are a regular. It's a small restaurant, but it's clean and the service is fast and friendly. I have always felt like it was family serving me when I've dined there.  To date, this is the best place for pho noodles that I've been able to find in Phoenix. I'm pretty stuck on the meatball and shrimp pho, which is my usual order, but I also love the Bun ch gio deluxe. The pho comes out incredibly hot, and after adding a good dose of Sriracha sauce, fresh basil, cilantro, and lime, is ready to eat. But first put your face over the bowl and inhale deeply, as that's the best way to understand why pho is such a wonderfully delicious meal. :)  I highly recommend a visit to Pho Avina if you are in the mood for some great Vietnamese cuisine, especially the pho. The spring roll appetizer is also quite delicious while you wait for your pho as well!",

I liked what I had and will most certainly return to try something else.

First off, this place is in a great location as it is less than one block from campus.  It is also clean and welcoming restaurant.  Secondly, the staff was extremely friendly; the gentleman who took my to-go order even opened my order to show me what was there and how to combine the ingredients for a traditional experience, although I already knew what to do.  Third, I ordered the #51 \"Bun Tom Bi Cha Gio Thit Nuong\" with chicken.  I waited for no more than 15 minutes as I watched the service staff effectively and quickly attend quests as they walked in.  As, I mentioned above the server who helped me showed me what I was getting and I immediately wanted to sit down and dig in.  Instead I drove to campus and hurried to sit down so I could and combine the cup of fish sauce seasoned dressing with the heaping traditional salad accompaniment and the noodles and meat.  Along with perfectly grilled and seasoned chicken there was a crunchy, delicious egg roll snuggled between shrimp and shredded pork both perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It was enough food for two meals and I will definitely go back for more, maybe some Pho next time.",

I also had the the chicken fried rice which has to be the best rice I've had in a long time. They get 1 star off for the chicken in the fried rice and the fact that they are closed on Sunday's. I think they could cook it a little longer as it was a bit chewy, but still on the all time best fried rice list!!! The entree I split with a friend was # 53. Rice noodles with beef and fried egg roll, pour in the fish sauce and enjoy what could be some of the best I've had since being in Vietnam while in the service. Last I had a boba Thai tea to go. Also the best Thai tea I've had in Az hands down. You will see me checking in here quite often and trying other things as I am sure the entire menu is going to be tasty! Great drive by discovery!",

I order the beef raw so it can cook in the hot broth to my liking. Plenty of beef was served.  The spring rolls were good.  The calamari was over-breaded and not cooked all the way through. It was also over-salted. More breading than calamari. I will pass on this item next time.",

Unfortunately, I need to echo what others have recently written. The service and flavors were nothing like what they used to be.   Spring rolls had been prepared a long while before and were very dry and unappetizing. Chicken curry had a few bits of chicken, weak curry flavor and lots of soup with little substance. The eggrolls were all crunch with nearly nothing inside.    I would have given it 1-star, but I intend to go back and try again in a few months. I like the people who run the shop and hope they turn this around. If not, then my next trip would be my last.",

Combo #52 bun dac biet and the spring rolls were amazingly good and totally comforting, and holy huge portions!! I also couldn't get away without trying the pork egg rolls, there's something so fun about eating Vietnamese egg rolls! If you've never had them I say, DO IT! But people please do it right! First take that crispy roll and wrap it in the lettuce with the fresh cilantro and herbs then dip and devour!  You can thank me later. Ps the staff was so sweet if you aren't familiar with the cuisine they'll help you out. I'm glad I went and it won't be the last time!",

Avina and her mother took over and did great things, but it's gone a bit downhill since they sold out.  Today, I got 7 orders of spring rolls to go with extra peanut sauce.  The rolls had less flavor and meat than in the past.  The sauce used to be great.  We dug in to find that it was watered down and just not good.  I called them to let them know that there was an issue, and was told that was the \"new recipe.\"  I expressed my displeasure and hope they go back to the old recipe.  There is no sense to cut corners at the expense of losing loyal customers.  It saddens me to give a less than 5 star review, with my years of history.  I originally was going to give them a 2, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll fix it, and restore the quality and guest experience provided by the past owners.",

We ordered the snoh and had asked for extra toppings. They gave us so much snoh and VERY little toppings (as you can see in pic below). Maybe it was just not the time to go since it was a couple days before Christmas, but if your not going to care about the food you serve before the holidays then you should just don't close for that time, just an opinion.  The service well let's just say it matched the food.",

First of all, the new people working here was rude and gives a little of attitude almost everytime they hand our food over to us.  Secondly, we order a roll, seems like that roll was not even fresh. We barely touch the roll and the roll fall apart and had to request a new one Thirdly, I ordered the soup, the soup was a bit blend now not wat it used too. The flavor wasn't there anymore and my bf ordered the pork chop n stuff omg the meet was not fresh and tasted like I was chowing rubber. And also my brother in law ordered a chicken curry and the worse part was there was plenty of curry but not chicken to be found. Like really?!?! And when we complained about it they come out with the new order in less than 2 mins when we waited for almost an hour on our order and constantly asking for our food is ready or not coz they seem to keep  forgetting our food out. Lastly, we order a boba I love boba but for some reason I really hate there boba. One of the worse boba places I've tasted. The boba they use was so tasteless.  I would never recommend this place to anyone anymore. It's not the same anymore  :(  This new management thing was a bad idea.",

    "text": "Being Vietnamese, it's not too often I got out for Vietnamese food. It's very hard to find a place that could compare to our homemade dishes. Although after trying Pho Avina, I can say I love this place! I discovered it because it is right across from ASU West campus, and I got out class early one day and had a mad craving for pho! I remembered seeing the sign as I printed off some work at the local FedEx. I decided that I was going to give them a try. NO REGRETS. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Walking in, they greet and seat you immediately and excitedly. It's a very quick and casual setting. They take orders quickly and bring out the orders quite promptly, perfect for tight school schedules. The first time I came I had the chicken pho and spring rolls. YUM. I really like how they added ground garlic to the chicken pho. When  I ordered spring rolls, the waitress asked if I would like the grilled pork, I said \"sure why not\". Traditionally it's usually just a boiled pork, but I must say, I am loving the grilled pork in my spring roll, add so much more flavor! I enjoy how there's a little bit of a personalized chef's touch to their food. Even though different, the chef pairs it so well! Since then, I've also tried their egg rolls and steak and meatball pho, which was also very enjoyable. So far, I'm really liking this place, they've got great food, service, and recommendations. -1 star because the pricing it a bit high for a pho shop, but I don't think I see that stopping my from coming back. I can't wait to try all the other dishes here!",

    "text": "Just what happened on this place? I have not dine here for 1 year because it was far from my new place. Today I gathered with the family and ate dinner here. A group of 10+ People with kids. The place is still packed like the last time we came here but the people that used to work here are gone. The old lady that greets us everytime is nowhere to be found. There are new servers,younger ones and this new servers are a bit rude. And iam being nice when I said \"bit\". Even the people who were with me noticed the change. This people are not avid yelpers but i knew I have to change my review when the oldest of the group said \" our server don't like us huh? \". . .  Attitude aside, I must also report the change on the food. Most of this people ate here before. I ordered more than I could handle tonight, and there's a reason for that. I needed to make sure that I was only imagining or if my taste buds were off. Yet I was not alone with my assumptions, this place has lost its flavors. I ordered G3, the springroll, a soup(pho), and a even a bobba. The soup alone would have been enough for me. But I really wanted to make sure that I  won't be making accusations with the flavoring. The soup is bland, very bland, my gf even ordered her favorite here: the meatball soup  and she puked :( (sorry for that info). Anyways the other soup I had was so bland that I needed to put alot of soy, sarachi,alone other stuff to get some kind of flavor on it. The springroll came undone and I had to ask them to rewrap it. The G3 was the biggest problem. I know I am no chef, but I know when the food served to me is not fresh. This meat were NOt fresh. U cut to them and their not tender rather they have a rubber band effect. Man I swear I could not t take any more of it.  Anyways as I always say on my reviews, please try them for your own sake. I AM pretty sure some people will still like them. But hey I know for sure I am not going back here. As an option please go to 43rd ave pho if you guys want a better quality pho and  oh and that service.  I brought the food home. My dog will have vietnamese food for supper.",

It took a word to flush 16 years of loyalty down the drain.  Won't be back and simply don't understand this mentality.  So when people ask me which Vietnamese restaurant to recommend I'll start by saying don't come to this place... ever! Then I will recommend that they go to a good place like Angelina's Pho & Grill or Phoenix Pho.  My only regret about this post is I couldn't rate it a ZERO, but I guess it one there's always room to go down from here.",

At some point I ordered the Pho Ga and the chicken tasted gamey like it had been cooked a few days prior and reheated. The taro blended drinks are gritty and overpriced. This past week I ordered a build your own pho with shrimp and tofu. The shrimp had discolored, dark tails, and some vein leftover from improper cleaning. The herbs and vegetables had some green mushy leaves mixed in for good measure. After all that, the cashier gave me the wrong change but it wasn't worth it to go claim a buck and some coins. I hope they step up their game and the quality improves in the near future.",

The pho was good although I wish there were more jalapenos in the sides and I wish there were onions as well. Next time I will be sure to ask for both.

    "text": "New: I went here with my my brother in law from Tucson last night. He loves pho and this was the only one close by open until 9pm. We ordered pho dac biet dinner portion and a pho gau lunch portion. The dinner portion was like the biggest bowl of pho ever served. My husband and BIL couldn't even finish their bowls....and they usually order pho xe Lua all the time. The soup was good. I am changing my star to a 3 because our dine in experience was better than our to-go order. The expensive price is worth the amount of food served. But only 3 stars because my friend ordered a strawberry banana Boba and it tasted powdery and like pepto bismo, $6 bucks. What a waste, she left more than half on the table when we left. Sad.   Old: I ordered some food to-go a few weeks ago and was super disappointed. I've eaten here many times in the past and really enjoyed their food but maybe since the new owners, they are not into quality assurance as the old owners. All I ordered was two sandwiches thit nguoi combination and a regular dac biet pho. 1) the sandwiches were horrible! I used to think these were the best Vietnamese sandwiches in town, even better than Lee's Sandwiches. The meat, the pate, and mayonnaise really made the sandwich stand out. I was very excited to have the sandwich again but after a few bites it didn't taste good so it definitely didn't taste like it used to. I opened it up and there was a smudge of pate on one side as big as a thumb print and on the other side there was a smudge of mayonnaise as big as a thumb print also. And there was very little meat, none of it overlapped. My husband and I used to fight over who got the last bite of the sandwiches but this time we both said you can have it I don't want it anymore. 2) The pho was nothing great. I thought the regular bowl is way over priced! $9? I asked them if that was the XL bowl when I was ordering and she said no the XL bowl is $11. Pho Avina is overpriced by $3 per a bowl. So basically their Pho better be the best...and it definitely wasn't so...I'm a NO GO!!",

But the ethnic ones are always a bit off the main strip, so we were excited, well I was, to find one of the few Vietnamese restaurants.   I'm excited to see certain authentic Vietnamese dishes like bun Bo hue. But I needed pho. This girl needed.pho. PHO!!!  Erik on the other hand wanted eggrolls. Not as an appetizer. Well as an appetizer but also as his main course. But I managed to order him something more substantial.    The eggrolls. They're small and that goes for the order size as well. Two, 2. That's all you get. It sucks.   Anyways, Erik wasn't too happy with the order size I've and the flavor. He wasn't thrilled.  He actually praised Viet Kitchen's eggrolls better.   The pho was decent. Erik got a noodle nest with sauteed veggies and beef. Be felt the beef was too chewy but they seemed fine to me.   So would I go again if I'm in the area? Probably, and would try another dish or two. At least I found a vietnamese place....yay!!!",

Ordered Pho and watched other people walk in after me and get their food 10 minutes quicker.   Or you get someone else's bill. I have placed to go orders and gotten into a borderline argument over extra peanut sauce. I had that happen 3 times. I didn't ask their opinion of how much I should have. I want more and will gladly pay for it.  The spring rolls taste very good but fall apart consistently.  The Pho isn't bad, but I can go many other places and not be annoyed. They do have good desserts that you won't get in most places .",

The convenience in location brought us back, even though it seemed like their portions were getting smaller and smaller.  Today we ordered a takeout and I found a a cut fingernail in my noodle soup.  I can't tell if its a finger or a toenail, but it still makes me sick thinking that I ate some of it.  Its too bad because the mom here seems like such a nice sweet person, but somewhere along the line, whether its the cook or someone by the takeout boxes, someone is cutting their nails where they shouldn't.  I obviously will no longer go there and suggest no one go there either.",

I've had numerous people tell me to go try this place out so finally I did.  I ordered the pho with just the beef(tai) and meatballs(bo vien), an order of spring rolls(goi cuon) and a boba shake.  The pho was delicious, very tasty and amazingly sweet without having any MSG added to the mix.  Thumbs up for me, the service was great and superfast and friendly.  This is where I shall eat pho this side of the valley from now on.  Only few places beat the dining experience here if you want Pho.  As for any of the other dishes they serve, I cannot comment because I have not yet tried them but will soon.",

They have tons of choices. What I like about their rice selection is that it comes with the BBQ pork. Shredded Pork Skin, Fried Egg (rare in Phoenix, I think), and crab cake (I think that is what it is called). Other places will only have the meat, shredded pork skin  and rarely the crab cake.

It wasn't even that the service was bad just....weird.  I eat at plenty of ethnic places so I'm used to people not understanding English but the gentleman would come to our table, pretend to take our order, leave and then the woman would come back and take it again. This happened over and over- \"Can I get a refill on my soda?\" man nods, woman comes back and asks what we wanted. It wasn't just us. There was a large family eating there and they were really having problems. The biggest issue for me was when I ordered something (crispy pork skin something or other) the woman looked at my date and said \"That is pork skin, she won't like it. She should order something else\" Uh, hello? I'm sitting right here! I think I can figure out that crispy pork skin means just that, crispy pork skin! Then I ordered some spring roll thing (Sorry, its been a couple of months now and I don't remember exactly what everything was) and again, she looks at my date and says \"She'll have to roll those herself. She should order something else\" WTF? Did I just become invisible or what? Trust me, lady, I have rolled plenty of my own, spring rolls and otherwise! It was one of the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant in the states. I've been in other countries where I was systematically ignored in favor of speaking to the man I was with but not in my own neighborhood! So, personally, I'll stick w/Little Saigon in a cute little house in Old Town Glendale where I'm dotted on by the flamboyant waiter and the food is better.",

I will eat desert first next time rather than miss it.   The pork chop is the best I have had anywhere and in any cuisine. The Pho is savory and memorable. They have cilantro. They have a wide variety of such soups. I had the mixed vegetable and meats in the bowl made out of crunchy noodles. It was huge with lots of beef, chicken and shrimp. It is served very vey hot, almost boiling hot. This kind of cooks the crunchy noodles but leaves them still crunchy. Don't burn your lips you will want to chow down on it. I am thinking of getting strawberry everything snow and munching bites of it between bites of the crunchy noodle bowl dish next time.  The noodle bowl combo is 12.00 and the pork chop 8.00. Our waiter recommended these two items as among his favorites. He was so seriously excited about these two items he forgot to give us the heads up on the \"Snow\" closing at 9:00.  You do not want to miss the \"snow\"",

    "text": "I have been eating at Avina's for over 30 years.  Back when the original restaurant was at 43rd Ave and Bell Road.  It was the BEST Vietnamese food in the valley.  When Avina sold it to the new owners they changed a lot of the recipe's and it just is not the same anymore.  They are always busy so I am sure they will stay in business but they are so disorganized and the service is horrible.  We keep going there hoping for the old Avina's and keep getting disappointed.  We were just there this weekend and our egg rolls were so cold we had to send them back.  Then we watched people that came in after us, order, eat and leave before our food came.  When our food finally came, it was cold!  Then they kept looking at the checks stacked up at the register and you could tell they were not sure which check belong to which table.  We had to go up to the register to pay, they never brought the check.  They never refill drinks, they leave the dirty dishes on your table until you leave, they don't ask if your food is good or if you would like anything else and as another review noted they don't ask about dessert which they could increase their sales if they did since they have Boba and Snow which is good.  I am so disappointed in the new owners.   They must not have owned a restaurant before and they need some serious help!  We have been trying other Vietnamese restaurants and have not found a new favorite yet.  If I had a choice for my last supper it would be Vietnamese food so I can't express enough the disappointment I have with the way this restaurant has changed.  Avina - Please open another restaurant, we miss you!  Sorry, I wish my review could be better.",

And on such occasions one of my favorite places is Pho Avina. They offer a good variety of  soup and noodle dishes as well as a variety of sandwiches (banh mi). Their rice dishes are also great; my favorite is their Pho Avina rice plate with grilled beef, pork, and shrimp. While the range of offerings may not be as extensive as Pho Thanh's, it is definitely more than adequate. Fast service, tasty food, good prices - all in this relatively modest restaurant in a  quiet strip mall across the street from ASU West.",

One of the waiters spilled broth all down my back. The waiter knew what he did and said \"Oh\"...but didn't bother to say a word to me. I only noticed what he had done after I felt the broth soaking into my clothes.  I grabbed napkins and started to clean off my clothes and nothing was still said to me. It was only when I went to ask for my check, a guy by the name of Andy simply said \"sorry about that.\" I asked what I was supposed to do if my clothes ended up with oil stains. He said \"It was only broth. It's not going to stain. It's not like it was red wine or anything...And it was really only a few drops...\" So I told him, \"No, there is oil...so it CAN stain! and NO, It wasn't a few drops. My entire back is wet.\" Again, his response...\"Oh, well sorry.\" I'm beyond furious and it blows my mind that if I hadn't said anything, they wouldn't have even cared!! Rest assured, they will be getting the dry cleaning bill if these spots don't come out!!",

The veggies were also very well cooked. The only thing is, the broth wasn't very flavorful. I got the chicken broth with my veggie pho. Even adding the basil and cilantro into the broth (and jalepenos because I like a little kick) still didn't give it much life. It was also $10 just for the pho, which was a little more that what I would have liked to pay. Maybe I was spoiled at my other Pho place I regularly visit which was only $7.95 and had amazing broth.",

Their pho is great and tastes even better with some sriracha sauce (make a full red circle in your bowl) and hoisin sauce (make a smiley face).  If I'm really hungry, I can finish the entire bowl.  Usually I leave some soup and let them take it.  We're interested in trying their macarons since I've only tasted Napoleon Bakery (which is fabulous), but they didn't have any the last few times we've been there.  It probably doesn't help we usually stop in there during the week well after normal dinner time.  Pho always comes out quick if you're hungry and can't wait.  I've noticed their other dishes take more time.  I like how they make their broth from chicken stock since we don't eat beef.  I think one time they ran out and used vegetable broth.  It tasted okay, but chicken broth tastes much better.  It tastes healthy too.  You can't ask for much more when getting \"fast\" vietnamese food.",

Good choice. My meal was pretty darn good. The only reason I didn't give more stars is because once my server dropped off my food (with bill), I didn't see her again.

I'm not a pho/soup kind of guy, but my girlfriend is a big fan of what's offered, including the option of just getting a little cup of broth on the side of a meat/rice plate.  Service has a tendency to go downhill when the place gets busy. They always bring food out at different times, meaning that someone can get their dish, while someone else might have to wait 10-15 minutes. I can't figure out if this is just the result of bad service or if it's just some kind of cultural difference, as it's not the first time it's happened at a Vietnamese restaurant.  If you want dessert, 90% of the time, they never ask you, so you either have to go to the snoh bar and pay for it separately (and hope no one steals your seat), or tell them when they bring you the bill that you'd like to add snoh to it. The whole system, or lack thereof, is just very disorganized.  The reason why I often overlook all of these annoyances is because their snoh is some of the best that we've found! Its creamy texture is absolutely perfect, as opposed to most places that end up with too much ice. The coconut flavored snoh with chocolate drizzle and bananas is one of my personal favorites.  Overall, while there are some places that I think have a better well-rounded experience, have a little patience and you'll probably enjoy Avina's offerings.  Recommended to try out.",

However, we did have some very long wait times both for dinner and for the dessert.  The food was very tasty, the servers were pleasant and concerned and the prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant was clean and they really acted like they were glad you were there!    We will definitely eat here again.",

I ordered a small iced Thai tea, shrimp spring rolls, and chicken and shrimp pho in a lunch sized portion. The Thai tea was really sweet. It didn't have much flavor and was just overpowered with sweetness. The shrimp springs rolls were very refreshing and fresh. The peanut sauce that came with it was also too sweet. Now for the pho, I believe the pho was perfectly balanced. It was not overpowering in the spice Star anise. I could taste it but it wasn't super strong like other places have been.   The customer service was amazing. We were never left hanging at any moment. There were multiple people going around asking if you needed anything and making sure it happened.   Besides the overly sweet Thai tea and peanut sauce, I liked Pho Avina and I would totally return!",

I was starving so I was eating it while driving home. The beef was inedible. I kept spitting it out. There were many pieces of beef but I would say I swallowed maybe 1 to 2 pieces and even then I was forcing myself to eat those. The rest of the beef was horrible. It was either complete fat or some other part that wasn't meat but inedible parts of it. I ended up just chowing down the lettuce and the noodles without the meat. I paid $10 for just plain noodles. Oh my, I'm not sure if I'll be back. I don't want to call them and complain but seriously, my dinner experience was the worst ever! It wasn't like I was gonna drive back and return it. I live half an hour away. They were just close to my work. Anyways, they need to not be serving questionable meats to customers just to save money cuz they are gonna lose their customers, like I'm returning anytime soon!",

    "text": "The only good thing about Pho Avina is the fact that it's clean. Besides that everything falls a bit short; in terms of service and food.  Came in looking for a new Vietnamese spot to try and to curb our Vietnamese cuisine and boba/snow craving.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, not too many people were dining at the time of arrival but quickly filled up. I ordered the Clear Rice Noodles with soup on the side (Hu Tieu Saigon). It's a noodle dish that comes with bean sprouts, onions, clear rice noodles, slices of bbq pork, pieces of imitation crab, shrimp and chives. The noodles are tossed in a sweet soy and comes with a side of broth (chicken). The dish was lacking in flavor and portion. Even with chili sauce and a spritz of lemon, the dish was lackluster and just had a sweetness to it. It was 35% onion and bean sprouts. Totally not a satisfying nor did it taste close to what Hu Tieu Saigon should taste like. We were given a plate of veggies and the cilantro was wilted and the plate looked limp as if sitting out for past it's prime.  The service was a bit spotty, it was good at first and kind of awkward. A few customers ended up leaving because they weren't being helped though there was a good amount of staff available. At this point I didn't order boba/snow dessert because I didn't think the food or service was good.  Price is decent if you're looking for a mediocre bowl of noodles and slow service, but you can get better quality Vietnamese food elsewhere. The only thing going for this place is it's clean atmosphere.",

I found that if you order pho to go, you can ask them to package the meat separately, as long as you swear to cook it right away. I did so, and the pho was much tastier when prepared fresh.  Another time, determined to branch out from pho, I ordered the special catfish. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of bottom feeders. They get that muddy flavor to them.   But not this catfish! It tasted clean and fresh, and it had a light, crispy breading on it. The whole dish was fantastic.   I also still adore their melon boba tea. I tried the taro one time, and it was OK. But melon is where it's at. My only criticism is that the boba pearls have a slightly gritty texture.",

Fortunately, we remedied that error and won't make it again in the future. Awesome pho at a good price considering the size of the portion. Don't forget to add the plate of garnish to your soup. I thought it was missing a layer of flavor until I realized that the fresh parsley, cilantro, bean sprouts and lime wedge were intended to go IN the soup. It was perfect after that, and the oxtail version was only $7.99 for a huge bowl of soup that came with three good-sized oxtails. I think in the future I'd try the soup with round steak instead since it is a bit cheaper. We also had a pasta dish I'm sure I couldn't pronounce but it was delicious too. The pho was my favorite though. I'd never tried boba before but the one we had was good and there were tons of flavors available.  I've seen some of the complaints about the service, but it was awesome when we were there. We were greeted at the door and they took our order and brought the food pretty quickly. Restaurant was a bit on the loud/echo-y side but there was a pretty consistent flow of people in and out the whole time we were there.",

    "text": "I LOVE this place. When I lived over here I would go here constantly, like every week. It's very small and the service isn't the fastest, but the people barely speak English, so I'm not complaining too much.  It's definitely a legit Vietnamese place. The menu is huge! My favorite item is the rolls. They bring out a forest of garnishes - mint leaves, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. I always get the spicy pork. It's got nuts and chili flakes on it. Yum! They bring out the moist rice paper and away you go! The absolute best part is their peanut sauce. It's to die for. I asked for the recipe once and the little old lady (the owner) just laughed and shook her head and said, \"haha no no...no.\" She reminded me of Superman's Hispanic maid on Family Guy.  Only con is their awful bathroom set up where you have to wait until the cooks are ready for you to walk back there. Kind of annoying. And they also can't accept credit cards for less than a $10 charge.",

Last time before this we were basically forgotten towards the end of our meal and sat for over 20 minutes and realized our waiter disappeared and we could hardly get anyone else's attention. Finally gave card to pay and waited another 20 minutes for our card back so we could get the hell out of there. Tonight my husband was craving pho so we gave it another chance. Big mistake. Tables around us who got there after us got their food, paid and left way before us. Again we were left sitting there being ignored. It was just awful. They also got our food wrong but decided to overlook that though we were annoyed. It felt like the waiter had no idea what they were doing and the constant waiting makes us never want to come again. Very disappointing since I've recommended this place to a lot of people over the years. Might come by for boba but that's about it",

You've never had Vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment.  For those two things, PA is awesome!     Nice people, decent food, and a very friendly environment. But their food doesn't stack up to the central Phoenix standard bearers.  I suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in.  Were they the only game in town, I suspect I would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a Bahn Mi every now and again.",

I love getting a boba tea and the veggie spring rolls after I get out of class or when my boytoy and I go tandem-ing. The service here isn't the fastest, but I don't mind waiting for the delicious food.   The peanut sauce really takes the a-ok veggie spring rolls out of this world. If I could find a discreet way to lick the sauce container after my rolls are finished, oh boy I would.   The boba tea compliments the spring rolls well. My personal favorite is the coconut, but all of the other flavors I've tried are good as well.   Just a quick tip: $10 minimum on all credit/debit card purchases.",

Spring rolls were brought out right away and were very delicious with a very yummy peanut sauce. Pho was brought out right after and I thought it the broth was very flavorful and vegetables were fresh. Lots of the seafood and pork as well.   They also have a \"Boba Bar\" inside which i can't wait to try.  I was very pleased, thought this one was of the cleanest Pho restaurants I have been to. Boyfriend who is Asian prefers his fave at 17th Ave and Camelback, I will definitely go back!",

I am addicted to spicy beef roll your own!  In the past few years, she added boba, snow, and macarones.  ALL DELICIOUS!

I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix (obviously trying to be a food badass, cuz I am) and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz.  For the record I ordered easy.  I went ZERO pho as it was 142 outside.  I went BBQ Pork bahn mi, spring rolls, bobas.  I GOT SOME MOTHERFACKINGSHITTASTICAMERICANIZEDBOOLSHEEET.

It just so happens this week I'm house sitting on the west side so decided to have an early dinner on my way out.   What's funny is this place is right on the edge of my old stomping grounds. My elementary school is just a few blocks from there.. of course there were memories of my first kiss.. my first girlfriend.. none of which actually took place there but hey memories, cant control 'em.  I decided that I was going to be hungry for a Vietnamese sandwich called Bahn Mi as well as a bowl of soup, pho. Got the sammie, the special with pork roll, cilantro, cucumber, jalapeo, pickled carrots and daikon on crusty French bread. This was very satisfying.. while not as great as Da Vang it held its own.   I also ordered the Vietnamese style beef stew called Bun Bo Ko.. thick tender chunks of beef in a rich and complex broth served with cilantro, lime, bean sprouts and jalapeo along with vermicelli noodles. This was off the hook tasty! The flavors were sweet, savory, slightly spicy and YUM-E!    The service is very friendly and welcoming. The interior won't win any design contests but here, its all about the food!  They take plastic.. this is always an important aspect to me as I rarely carry cash..",

You can tell because there's  a buttery taste that stays in your mouth even after drinking water. The ox tail pho was the soup with the most fat n grease.

I will have to remember that next time. So we decided on pork chop rice plate and honey dew boba. The rice plate was exactly what I expected. The meat had lots of seasoning and very tender. The boba was really good. Perfect sweetness and chewiness of bobas.  Would love to return to try their banh mi!",

Then the owners changed or something and their Pho broth changed and was really pretty gross, and I lost my taste for Pho after so many years of craving it. I read the reviews on Yelp and thought I would give it a try again because I had a cold and was craving the rich, flavorful broth that I remembered.  I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food. We walked in and I was immediately impressed with the clean, welcoming atmosphere. They were pretty busy, but we were seated and our drink order was taken right away.   We ordered a Shrimp soup with Won Ton and egg noodles, egg rolls, spring rolls and the fried sweet potato with pineapple, along with a combo noodle dish with beef and chicken. Wow, wow wow!  We got our food quickly and everything looked amazing. The herbs that came with the soup were super fresh, and the broth was complex, so rich and full of flavor, without a hint of greasiness. Everything we ordered was amazing. The Pho broth tasted exactly the same as the original Avina's recipe that I remembered.   I can't wait to go back!!",

Took making eye contact to get some help, and once we did it was snappy help. The food came out quickly but then once I went to pay (at this point we waited so long we were the last people there and they were mopping the floors... Couldn't that wait until we left so we don't slip and fall?) the woman behind the counter was totaling the receipts for the day in the register and didn't acknowledge me. No \"I'll be right with you\" or \"just one second\" she just straight up did not acknowledge my presence. So I left the exact amount in cash and got the heck out of there. I will never go back.

With that said, I do really enjoy this place.   Pros:   They have jasmine tea and it comes in a pot you can pour yourself with the cutest tea cup!   Comfortable atmosphere. I often come here solo to do some reading or just for a quick lunch in between classes since it's right across the street from ASU west.   Their broth is really tasty. Doesn't have too much anise which I like.   This place is cheap!! Large portion of pho and tea for 10 bucks can't beat it.   Cons:  Their meat isn't the best. The first time I got the brisket and it was really cut too thick and it was fatty. I wouldn't recommend it.   AND the meat to noodle ratio is a little off sometimes. But I prefer more meat to noodle and normally order extra meat but it costs 3 whole dollars extra for meat.   If you are starving and want the larger size bowl, it's also three dollars more.   Overall, a decent and convenient place and one I would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I have been a customer at Pho Avina for years. What initially led me to patronize this restaurant is the affordable entrees and quick service. Food quality was usually above average - good. Service has never been especially friendly, but at least it was expedient. However, I feel the need to echo the voices of several others who have indicated that the quality of food and service at this restaurant has gone downhill dramatically, to the extent that I am no longer a fan of this establishment.  First off, food quality at Pho Avina has been on the decline. Previously delightful entrees are now of mediocre quality. Service has also been on the downward spiral. Pho Avina waiters are definitely still as efficient as ever, but they are not responsive to customer needs. Errors in taking orders are common here, and I cannot count the number of times I have had to remind the waiter to bring an appetizer (usually spring rolls) or drink (boba tea).  To illustrate an example of bad service combined with bad food, take for example my latest foray with my wife and child to Pho Avina...  It seldom rains in Phoenix, but when it does, I love to get a bowl of hot Pho. Imagine my disappointment when, rushing in from the pouring rain, I discover that the restaurant is out of beef broth with which to prepare Pho. The restaurant was pretty busy, so I could understand that everyone else probably had the same idea I did. The waiter suggested I try some Pho with chicken broth instead. I decided to order the Chicken Pho from the menu. Wife ordered chicken friend rice. My wife's order came rather quickly, which is normal at this restaurant. Mine took a long time to come, which is odd considering that they usually deliver Pho at the speed of light. When it came, I was hungry and ready to dig in to a steaming hot bowl of delicious Pho... but when I took the first sip of the broth, I almost spat it out. I do not exaggerate when I say that the \"broth\" tasted like hot water with some oil mixed in. There was no chicken flavor, in fact hardly any flavor of any kind. I had my wife try the broth too and she agreed - the broth lacked any flavor. Even adding hoisin sauce to the broth failed to rescue the insipid soup. Normally, I do not like complaining to the management since I rather avoid drama during mealtime, but my wife convinced me to raise this issue up with the management. I told the waiter the problem with my Pho soup. He promised to bring this up to the attention of the management. My wife and I heard discussion emanating from the back kitchen with some recognizable words (\"chicken\", \"broth\", etc... you get the idea). About five minutes later, the elderly lady who seems to run the place comes up to us and apologizes. This could have ended, if not well, at least better. But here was the real kicker. She asked us if we would like another bowl of soup to replace the one that was \"defective.\" Bear in mind that this was at the end of the meal, after my wife and I had finished most of our food. The Pho bowl was absent meat and noodles (I was hungry as I had mentioned, and swallowed the edible parts, leaving the \"soup\" behind), my wife's fried rice was gone, we were both no longer hungry, and we were being offered another bowl of soup. I am assuming she meant without the noodles/other ingredients but we were at this point no longer interested either way, so we said that we were full, but extremely disappointed that the broth tasted like dishwater. At this point, the elderly lady explained that they had a very busy night, and that \"somebody\" had added water to the stock, diluting it, which was the cause of our tasteless soup.  And that was that! She walked away. No offer of compensation, or maybe a free bowl of Pho on our next visit, nothing. Also, I should mention that the lady had recognized us as repeat, loyal customers (she said that she knows that we patronize the restaurant all the time).  I want to say that I am not here to bring down any establishment unfairly and I am not one of those particularly fussy customers that demands perfection. I seldom like to complain, unless I feel really unfairly treated. But this level of service is deplorable. If the Pho broth had been reasonably tasty or even slightly bland, I would still have let the issue go. But it was completely devoid of any taste, and to have the manager admit the mistake and offer no compensation of any sort - well let's just say there are two other Vietnamese restaurants within 5 miles of Pho Avina, and I will be bringing my business to the competition in the future.",

Their chicken pho has more of a Chinese wonton soup broth, but it's still very good if you're feeling a cold coming on. They also do a great job with rice dishes, my favorite is #58. The rest of other dishes they offer like spring rolls and Vietnamese sandwiches are good, but nothing to rave about. Although, they do offer very good boba drinks. It's arguably better than Viet Kitchen and Pho Thanh. I go here all the time for the past two years and highly recommend.",

I don't like the smoothies and milk teas here either, they taste like the powdered kind, and the boba/tapioca balls are always too squishy like they've been sitting in the water for too long (starting to notice a pattern?)

This is the first place in Phoenix that served a whole large leaf of lettuce for me to wrap my egg roll and dipping sauce. This is the way I was taught to eat Vietnamese egg rolls. The rice paper skin was crisp. The filling was flavorful. I did not miss the meat.  Our bubble tea was also very good. The pearls were perfectly prepared with enough chew and still soft. The blended drink had enough sweet and had good flavor. They had a plastic covering just like we enjoy them in Singapore.  Next time, I will definitely have the Pho!",

Saturday evening at 7:30 and the place was dead. Used to be packed. Ate light - ordered egg rolls (longtime fave) and shrimp:/pork spring rolls. Egg rolls used to come with fresh mint for great flavor, now just parsley (and mint is in high season now). Spring rolls were a bit larger, but packed with far more rice and less shrimp/pork than previous. And skimpy on the peanut sauce, had to request more. Wait staff seermed depressed, and unhappy, replacing previous joyous and welcoming staff. But with few patrons, come few tips. Never asked if i wanted a drink besides the room temp water i was served (certainly an income loss for them:). My table view (photo attached) was of open storage and boxes, and a bus cart front and center that sat there the whole time (35 minutes) and never used! Also the place is more dimly lit. It lacks the welcoming and energetic vibe of yesteryear and when the staff were excited to see and serve their customers. I may still go here when i have the hankering for vietnamese because its close and historically the food has been very good, but Pho Avina no longer beckons me to be a regular patron or recommend/bring guests.",

I get either the vegetable egg rolls or pork egg rolls to start. My favorite pho dish is the Meatball pho but the eye round steak is good as well. The soup always is very flavorful. If you come here you have to try their shaved snow. It's similar to ice cream but is very light and airy. It comes in different flavors such as Toro, Coconut, Mango, strawberry, coffee, and great tea with lots of topping and drizzle options. Nothing beats pho avina... I HIGHLY recommend!",

I am wondering if because it was opening hours they gave me remnants from the day before?   I am amazed that the waitress even served it as they could have obviously felt the temperature of the bowl! I have never abandoned a bowl of pho but I just did.   This is the second time in a row between visits that this has happened. There won't be a third time.",

But this last few times I have dined there the service has been awful. This last time especially. They took forever to come get our order, and it wasn't a busy night for them. Then after we got our food no one came back to check on us or refill our water. We even had to get our own Togo containers. Then the check never came and we had to go up to the front to pay for our meal. It's disappointing because I do enjoy the food, but this will hinder me wanting to come back.",

    "text": "Although I live in Michigan these days, I still spend about 20% of my time in Phoenix.  Every time I visit, I make sure I go to Pho Avina at least once or twice.  This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, I can't say a single negative thing about it.  The food never fails to amaze me - every meal I've had here has been nothing short of fantastic.  The portions are also very generous, and the food is incredibly inexpensive considering how good it is.  One other thing I have to point out is how awesome the staff is here.  Everyone has always been so friendly and has taken time to answer any questions I might have.  I absolutely love their Vietnamese coffee (I get it black, without condensed milk), and I've never been able to figure out how they make it so flavorful and amazing.  On my last visit to Pho Avina, I asked one of the servers if he could tell me how they make their coffee, realizing that they might not want to disclose their secrets.  He showed me how to use a Vietnamese coffee maker (different from other kinds of coffee makers), wrote down the brand name of the coffee they use (Trung Nguyen), and told me where in Phoenix I could buy both the maker and the coffee.  I was blown away by how forthcoming he was with information and how helpful he was, as many places probably wouldn't do this.  One thing I can say is to make absolutely sure that you eat at the restaurant.  Take out will not be the same, as pho needs to be made and eaten immediately - even a 10 minute wait can have a really drastic impact on its flavor.",

    "text": "Pho Avina is \"OK\" at best. It is hard to give an accurate rating using a five star system. This place would rate a five on a scale from one to ten.   However, I'm not going to be too harsh just based on the principle that there aren't many options with ethnic foods in AZ so they earn a three for that alone.   I can't say the food isn't terrible, because it isn't, but it is definitely sub par from the Vietnamese that I am used to. I tried the rolls, pho and rice dishes from Avina.    Avina's fresh rolls were small, and as mentioned oddly sweet. The hoisin and peanut (that's \"seafood\" or \"from the sea\") sauce was also a strange pastel color rather than the dark purplish brown that it naturally comes in. Probably watered down.    Their fried rolls were also very plain. It was just pork in there. Not very Vietnamese/SE Asian if you ask me. What happened to pork, \"wood mushroom\" (I have no idea what the fuck it's called in English believe it or not), carrots, and \"phun see\"?    Pho is, for lack of a better term, the bread and butter of a Vietnamese place. Avina's pho was scant on meat, and the broth as noted by another commenter was oddly sweet (as a matter of fact, everything there that isn't supposed to be sweet was very sweet).   Another deal is this, every Vietnamese restaurant I've been to gives you size options when ordering pho. Size small for children and those who just want to dip their toes or watch their \"figures\" and size large and extra large for those who crave pho so much where one measly bowl just won't do. The herb plate that accompanied Avina's pho bowl was also on the scant side but I guess since the noodle bowl is small you don't need so many herbs and jalapenos to throw in there do you. Guess not.   The rice dish I tried was also a let down. Not on taste (other than the sweetness) mind you, but again, every rice dish I'm used to comes standard with a slab of egg cake and a small portion of a ground up pork, tripe, and peanut mixture, along with your pickled carrots, turnips, and cucumbers. The rice dish from Avina came with two cucumber slices, and a couple (and I do mean a couple) of other pickled vegetables. The pork chop was also small as hell. Weak.   Asian food (aside from sushi houses) isn't known for serving small portions!   To sum it up, Avina is pricey for the kind of food that it is, has small portions, and everything is oddly sweet when it isn't supposed to be.",

The staff is very friendly, and they think it's awesome if you're daring enough to order more traditional menu items like the special beef soup or the durian boba (which is really tasty, despite its stinkyness).

I remember coming to their restaurant before they even moved to this plaza. I know when it was Avina and just her daughter working the place. The food never faltered. I also remember seeing a family who had called ahead for dinner and she had all the dishes they wanted, done and served as soon as they sat down. I mean that was just awesome for this small whole in the wall place.  Now, I'm not so sure anymore. I do know after I have come back I have only had one visit to Avina's. I had Canh Chua with shrimp.  It was delicious as I remember but a tad too sweet. I had a Vietnamese iced coffee. It was a bit watery. It still gets the 5-stars because I love Avina and her daughter. The place serves good food for a good price. I miss the TV only having Vietnamese shows.   Dishes that I remember eating here that are always good:  Pho Tai Canh Chua  with Shrimp Vietnamese pork chops over rice Vietnamese beef stew with slices of baguette Spring Rolls Egg Rolls Vietnamese Pancake Vietnamese Ice Coffee  This is my general list of what has to be good at a Vietnamese restaurant. It's not just a Pho shop and it's definitely not a Banh Mi shop.",

Having left AZ a few years back, i visted recently and decided to place an order there and introduce some friends and family to the traditionally accoladed \"pho.\" At 3:45 on a tuesday afternoon I ordered 4 pho ga (rice noodle soup with chicken) and an order of spring rolls on the side. No problem taking the order, they ask me to pick up in a half hour.  I arrive half an hour later -as directed, pay my bill, and pick up my order. As I'm getting settled in my car, I have the sudden inclination to check my order.  Opening each hermetically sealed container they've provided me, I realize I am short an entire order of pho. I turn off the car, make my way in, and inquire about the missing pho. They say, \"no problem\" and apologize. I wait another ten minutes to procure the missing soup and its  botanical accoutrements.  Ok, \"no problem.\"  I'm a bit perturbed by the situation, but I'm also a realist; this kinda thing happens! So I return home from my half hour drive, eager to present the pho and spring rolls to my viet cuisine newbies.  Low and behold, the noodles for all 4 pho orders are crispy, dry, and unsoaked.  FAIL. Somebody missed a vital step in the prep process.  For $50 I expect my noodles prepped accordingly. No happy ending here...no moist noodle for me.",

Not that I am complaining one bit! I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp soup (Do you see a theme? lol) and my friend kept it safe and just ordered the fried rice, which he says was some of the best he has ever had. My soup came out piping hot with tons of chicken and shrimp and herbs. I was one happy campy. So why the four stars if everything was good. The bathroom had a weird smell to it. I know, I know what does that have to do with the rest of the place. Well if you got to go potty and the bathroom stinks, it kinds of throws you off you know.

    "text": "Low key, casual, tucked away into a strip mall. I ordered the B3 with chicken. Taste wise, the chicken was really good. The pickled vegetables (all 4 slices of carrot) were a nice edge to the noodle salad bowl. They added that much needed crisp.   The fried spring roll my bowl came with was reaaallly tasty. I probably could've eaten a few more of those given the chance. Pretty sure they were pork spring rolls.  The noodles I felt were possibly overcooked. They broke apart completely during the mixing process and it really just ended up being mush, but thats not a huge deal breaker. The \"tangy fish sauce\" that was meant to accompany my bowl either never arrived, or it was the vinegar oil mixture they gave me in a plastic resealable container. Which had next to no taste. And it wasn't very fishy in flavor? So I guessed that wasn't it.  We also had to ask to order drinks. Because our waiter never asked us. Maybe this is typical for this type of place? I found it a tid bit odd. I didn't bother to ask for the fish sauce that was supposed to come with my meal cause I ended up using chili sauce as a substitute.   I cant really knock a place down for me trying something that really isn't their specialty. You know? I should've had pho instead. But I'm an asshole. Ill try that next time for sure.  My better half chose a fried noodle dish with chicken and beef. Noodles were over cooked, and he mentioned there wasn't much flavor. Again, they have pho in their name. Not \"noodle salad\".   We were still peckish, so we talked ourselves into some smoothies. Which...WERE AMAZING. My bearded bear man chose the coffee smoothie sans boba (he hates boba, he thinks its like boogers). I picked the Thai Tea smoothie with boba. I was nervous that they were going to be overly sweet with not much flavor but I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee smoothie tasted like great coffee. And my thai smoothie was perfect.   The main reason for the less than perfect rating (other than what I mentioned about the food and lack of drinks which were never refilled) was I noticed one of the servers sneezing/coughing constantly...while handling food..and cards..and drinks. If you're sick, stay home if you work in the food industry, otherwise you're a hazard.    Ill come back eventually, but next time Ill be a bit more cautious.",

I order boba smoothie here several times already, hoping that they will get better, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Well, this would be the last chance I would give them for boba.  The smoothie taste diluted,  or in order words, flavor water with ice sloshing around in it. The tapioca balls are soggy, and bland, not firm, chewy nor flavorful.   I would just come back here for the food, but never again would I be foolish enough to give their boba another chance.",

We also didn't have to wait too long for our food. We ordered and it came out less than 20 min. My boyfriend didn't like the fact that they only had 1 size for the pho. And so I gave him some of my noodles.  We did arrive around 8ish which they closed at 9, so I expected to feel rushed which is understandable. Only complaint I would have...which didn't bother me much was that they forgot about my Thai tea, but luckily one of the servers went around asking us for any last call orders.   I would go back again just maybe not so late, so I don't feel rushed.",

I was there with my boyfriend recently asnd specifically asked that they not be soggy and overcooked. STILL the noodles in my Bun were overcooked along with the noodles in my boyfriend's Pho. I realized that they have no intention of going to the trouble of preparing the noodles per order. They want to soak them in bulk to have them readily available for hours of orders. (This happens in fast food Italian restaurants too.)  No matter how good everything else is, the dish is ruined with soggy, overcooked noodles! It's so important that they be \"adente\". I complained to the owner and she shyly said nothing. She knows they are overcooked and has no intention of changing because it will be too inconvenient to cook them to order.   I'll never go back!  The best place in Phoenix is Da Vang on 19th Avenue between Indian School and Campbell.",

I don't really like the mint leaves in there, but everything else is good enough for me to get it again.   The fried rice is supppper good! I've tried it without meat and with chicken, and something about the spice makes it sooooo delicious!   I've tried the boba there and I would say it's alright.

It has been difficult finding a great pho place ever since we moved out here and even though this is a bit of a drive for us, we happily make the trip out to Pho Avina!  The fried and non-fried rolls are absolutely delicious- a great start to the meal.  The pho broth has a deep and clean flavor!  The sprouts and side items for the pho are also very clean.  They take the time to cut off the stringy part of the sprouts, which I think shows attention to detail.  We always finish our meal off with snow!  Every flavor that we've tried has been amazing, but our favorite is the taro flavor with condensed milk and strawberries:)  The family who runs this place are also all very nice people!  The staff is great too.  We didn't realize that they stopped serving snow after a certain time, but they were kind enough to make it for us!  Good people and good food-- win win!",

I ordered my meal the waitress didn't bother to write the order down so I assumed she knew what she was doing. As soon as my order came out it was incorrect and again I had to wave the girls down to fix the order.

    "text": "Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food.  The food is fresh, and delightful.  The menu is extensive and has all the traditional Vietnamese dishes I expected.   In addition to Pho, they serve other noodle (rice noodle and saigon noodle) and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads. Under no circumstances would I compare it to Cyclo.  Cyclo is not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant... Pho Avina is.  I would compare the variety and quality to Saigon Pho on Alma school, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have a nice selection of boba drinks.  I had a coconut one this time. I have had Avocado, Coffee, and mango as well.  So far, coconut is my favorite.  I think next time I will try taro.  mmmmm.... so good. I was so enamored with this place that I expect to stop there on the way home from work at least once every week or 2.  I need to add this note now..... since I first reviewed this place, it has become a real favorite of mine.  I stop here at least 1 or 2 times a week, and when I do, I often run into friends who learned about the place from me.  I'm headed there for dinner tonight.",

    "text": "yes.. there is PHO in PHOenix.. (err actually glendale but my play on words wouldn't work here)  i was using yelp as my handy guide to eating my way back to LA.  after seeing mcdonalds and wendys every block of the drive anywhere i decided i needed to see what AZ's opinion was on vietnamese food..   i just happend to be there a couple days after Don V.'s post.. he laid out his credentials on his pho knowledge and then described it to be \"The pho was delicious, very tasty and amazingly sweet without having any MSG added to the mix.\" i was sold the nite before.. and i couldn't wait for lunch to come sooner..   so glendale is huge.. and i had only seen the chain fast food restaurants everywhere and then we head over towards peoria and well.. damn.. it's a whole different scene.. it looks like it hasn't had a makeover like the rest of the town.. and just had a real feeling in that area.  i have to say.. it really didn't knock my socks off but i've had worse pho in LA.. it's flavorful but lacking in someways.. and it was very greasy..  i don't like grease in my pho..   but i wanted to also try their spring rolls and egg rolls.. it's nice they serve in smaller quantities because sometimes you don't want 5..   2 spring rolls - $3 2 egg rolls - $2  the egg rolls took awhile to come out but the spring rolls came out in a flash.. i didn't think too much about it and stuffed my face.. and then i looked at it again.. and there was a twinkle in my eye.. so rather than using regular pork in their spring rolls they use their grilled/bbq pork. so you get a kick in the ass flavor explosion..   then i knew i had to order the bun cha with grilled pork for the friend because.. it was the best grilled pork i've had anywhere.. and i don't even like grilled pork.  they have a different sauce for the bun cha than for the egg rolls..it's got chili paste in it for a stronger kick..   i was tempted to order more spring rolls but didn't and got a thai iced tea.. they don't use as much sugar as the other thai iced teas i like.. and it wasn't as creamy as if they just used a teaspoon of milk in the glass.. it was still quite dark too..   i'm not one to complain especially if i don't know the expectations of the neighborhood.. but i'm pleased with the help i got from yelp to save me from getting #1 combo from McDs..  which means more to me than anything..",

    "text": "I just moved to Glendale from Northern California, where Pho restaurants are accessible within a mile radius of where I used to live and work. I was craving some home cooked goodness, but since my mom wasn't here to make a stew pot of pho that could feed me for weeks, I decided to try this place with a friend who heard it was the best pho in town.   For starters, walking in, it definitely looked like a Vietnamese joint with the cheap looking chairs, hoison sauce and sriracha sitting on a lazy susan on the side of the table with the typical utensils necessary for pho. I'm kind of used to walking into a pho place and coming out smelling like it, and as much as I was happy to come across this place, it was a bit of a bummer that I couldn't smell the soup from the parking lot.   The pho was good, not great or what I'm used to, but it hit the spot. I'm taking off one star for two reasons. Pho shouldn't be served with shrimp ( I don't know who decided to put that in) but it definitely aint tradition. And the second reason was that the Vietnamese Crepes that I dream about eating when I go home for the holidays tasted borderline nasty. I don't know if it was the grease or just the flavor, but I was a bit bummed that this didn't taste better. My friend can attest that I was very excited to order this to go for dinner!  I think that the rest of the food probably tastes good. I think I want to try their spicy beef noodle and chicken pho. It could have been hit or miss with what I ate that day. I definitely like the service that we got. Some places kind of rush you to get in, eat, and get out, but here, they came by and refilled our water, and checked to make sure everything was ok, so two thumbs up for that!  I'm still on the hunt for the best pho place in town, so if anyone knows of one, wanna shoot me a line??",

I've only been there a couple of times during lunch for the popular Vietnamese subs (banh mi).  The combination pork roll is a baguette made up of thinly sliced pickled carrots, daikon, onions, cilantro, and meat or tofu. Popular banh mi fillings include pork, pate, and chicken.   The subs were pretty good, but you can't complain as they are less than $4.  Also, the pho looked good and I will definitely return to try another time.",

I ordered Thai Iced Tea, Spring Rolls and Chicken Pho. The spring rolls were fresh and tasty, but I was not feeling well and looking forward to the Pho.  Within 10 minutes, a large steaming bowl of Chicken Pho was placed in front of me. While there were plenty of noodles, there wasn't much meat. Still, it was delicious and it hit the spot. After a few dashes of Chili Sauce, I was also feeling much better.  The food was good and cheap, the staff was friendly and I have since visited again with my husband.",

My boyfriend and I ate here on Saturday afternoon, the place was very comfortable, almost all the tables were filled. We started off with an order  of  Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls. They both were just \"OK\" nothing to write home about!!     Then followed up with #34..42...49.. I know sounds like a lot of food, which it was, we took some for left overs. My boyfriend and I shared The Pho (#34) and  with a touch of 'Sriacha\" (my favorite Chili hot sauce) it was delicious, I would definitely come back and order that again in a heart beat!   My dish was the #49 It was good,. It had great proportions of meat and noodles,  yet it was missing something.. I don't know what it was, it  just wasn't satisfying my 'Foodie' palate.. don't get me wrong it was good, I\"m sure others would like it...But......Well,  Lets put it this way,  My \"Foodie\" radar wasn't going into over drive. lol.   My boyfriends # 42, he though was 'OK' he wasnt a huge fan, but enjoyed it.   We  have a little tradition between him and I, the second we get into the car, we  rate the \"OVER ALL\" experiance (Food, Prices, Customer Serivce, Ect).. We both agreed on a 7 out of 10  The great thing about this restaurant is the prices. With ordering half the damn restaurant. lol.. our bill was only $32. so we cant complain, we did get a lot of food, for our buck.  I can tell you I will eat their again, Yet I wont be trying to run anyone over to get their! :)",

The soup definitely has some characteristics but ultimately lacks any oomph. The meat portions are on the chintzy side and the spring rolls are a pass. The service is above standard and there definitely is a family feel.   Is it worth visiting? Carbon footprint-wise absolutely. But is it really enough to merely alleviate that craving or does it need to blow you away like it was your first time every time?",

They hoarded BIG TIME with the Pho soups by putting less and less ingredients and charging way too much for what BROTH and a couple of noodles and a couple of pieces of chicken or beef.  I found another Pho restaurant which most of you will love, it's called PHOLICIOUS!  There is no other Pho soup in both Glendale and Peoria that make the best soups ever.  I've been going to PHOLICIOUS for two years and they haven't cheated with the ingredients very much like Pho Avina does.  They didn't have a working toilet for the six years I went there, you had to go to Taco Bell or Arby's nearby.  Occasionally you still have to.  The boba was awful, watery and no boba!  Too damn expensive for a bowl of water and a watery drink.  The vegetarian spring rolls were horrendous and amateurishly made.",

She said she really doesn't eat it very often since it's fattening (mind you I think she probably weighs about 80 lbs. so I think she needs more pho!!). I was feeling a bit under the weather so a big ol' steamin' pho bowl was right up my alley.  I arrived a few minutes before they opened and people were already outside waiting-a good sign I thought.  Upon entering I was surprised as this is probably the cleanest Vietnamese place I've ever been to-another plus! So, I order pho tai and pork egg rolls.  The service was quick, and as more patrons entered the restaurant the staff welcomed everyone as if they were long time friends. My food arrives and everything is good, the pho broth is a little bit sweet than I personally would care for but has a good complex flavor.  Ditto the egg rolls, you can tell they're homemade when they're imperfect.  I thought their prices were a bit high but I certainly left with a full stomach. Though Pho Thanh is still my favorite, I would return to Pho Avina again another bonus it's not too far from the house.",
