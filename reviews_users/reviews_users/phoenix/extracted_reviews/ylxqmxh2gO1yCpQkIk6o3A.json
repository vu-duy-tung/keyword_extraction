We all were craving gyros and got the Gyro Meal.  French Fries were crispy and fluffy and the onion rings were the right kind of greasy and crunchy.  The gyros were fantastic.  Among the best any of us have ever had.  Lots of real meat, just enough sauce and a little messy.  We took a menu back and will be returning soon.  Service, Cleanliness, Quantity & Quality all earned top marks!",

I've had bigger gyros, but this gyro tasted great and will be going back for more.  You receive a good amount of fries with your gyro plate. The fries are pretty good too!  Besides gyros, there are several other sandwich options to choose from, philly's italian beef, hot dogs to name a few..  The inside decor isn't much, but I'll take good food at a place rather than nice decor/surroundings and bad food.  Want a good gyro, stop by Niros!  Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items.",

I can't explain it, but I was feeling the need for some righteous shaved gyro meat, tzatziki sauce and sliced onions crammed into a pita. This place did not disappoint.  Niro's single gyro is generously stuffed with meat. And the meat is heavily seasoned, so you really get the spice you're hoping for. That's a gyro done right in my opinion. I developed a taste for these in the Sachsenhausen district of Frankfurt, Germany. They always had a gyro cart popping up in your path whilst trekking betweenst bars. Let's face it, even completely sober, a well-made gyro is a thing of beauty (and gluttony).  The windows on this place are so heavily tinted, it's hard to tell if there's any activity inside. It was late afternoon, so I happened to be the only person ordering at the time. But while enjoying my meal, hungry stragglers popped in and out, proving to me that other serious gyro lovers make the trek here for gyros that are built to satisfy.",

After laying around the townhouse most of the morning, I decided to take a drive to get something to eat and shop at Costco in Tempe.  For a year or so I've wanted to try out Niro's Gyros at the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee.  The restaurant is located in a stand-alone building that must have been built and then abandoned by Pizza Hut.  No matter, once inside it is clean, with brightly colored tables and chairs. The front counter is gleaming white tile.    I ordered a double gyro plate, which includes \"two toasted pitas served with a mountain of gyro meat with gyro sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries on the side.\" After adding a large soda and hand over $12.71, I only had to wait five minutes for my number to be called.    This is a casual eating establishment (i.e. plastic forks), so the gyro meat comes packaged within a white styrofoam container wrapped separate in white paper with the hot pitas and fries on the side.  There is enough meat to  overfill both pitas.  I found the whole meal very tasty and enjoyable.",

What qualifies me to make such a resounding statement?  My husband and I have been to Greece several times and were married on the island of Corfu (in the Ionian Sea).    If that isn't enough of an endorsement, our friends from Chicago also thought Niro's served the best Gyros -- and Chi-town has the largest congregration of Greeks (hence \"Greektown\") outside of Greece.  But it isn't just the gyros that rock, I love any of their fried food too -- Mozerella Sticks, Onion Rings, French Fries.   I don't know what kind of oil they use - but the taste is fantastic and they are fried to crispy perfection.  The facility itself is misleading and unimpressive.  If you can get over that, you'll find a tastey gyro winner.  Don't keep driving by - stop in!",

Both the chicken and the meat gyros are fresh, served on warm pita bread, daubed with tzatziki sauce and some interesting onion-tomato seasoning. The fries are hot and without any trace of staleness. The flaky, syrupy, nutty baklava is a must try- get it for take out, microwave it for 10 secs and enjoy the goodness!!!  Derek r. has compare the place to Spices but I feel it is difficult to compare uniqueness, love Niro's for its own reasons and the same goes for Spices.",

Not only did I really enjoy it, all of my co-workers asked where I went and said that they smelled amazing.

    "text": "Wayyyyyyyy overdue on the review.  I lived in the Ahwatukee area of Phoenix for about 3 years and sadly moved away from the area, so Niro's isnt quite as handy as it used to be.  Suffice to say, in the 3 years I lived just down the road, I ate here approximately once a week, on average.  I love gyros and will only vouch for them, on the menu, but if you really enjoy a good gyro - you cant go wrong here.  This is a mom and pop owned establishment and when they arent busy, the owners are great to chat with.  You can see their passion for providing great food and great service - even when they are busy.  I love this place and when I am down in that part of the valley I always take a quick detour to revisit and enjoy the gyros!  My choice - double diet.  Its double the gyro meat, without the fries and the pita.  Love it!",

I wish we hadn't had gotten it- after ordering, I noticed a bag of frozen fries in the kitchen- that must explain the taste of old french fries. The mozzarella sticks were ok too, but they also seemed to be frozen.   The cashier was nice, though. I forget her name, but she was nice and did everything correctly in my eyes.",

Prices are reasonable & family friendly too!!",

First, the prices were perfect for me since I am a poor college student. I ordered the single gyro... By far the best gyro I have ever had. Because of the price I was worried it would not be enough food for me.. so I also ordered the Italian beef. I have to say that sandwich was HUGE for six bucks. The only problem I had with any of my food was the beef in the Italian beef, it was dry and bland. Because I had already had enough food from the gyro, I did not mind. I will absolutely be back soon for more food.. I am excited to try the Philly Steak, and the Hot Dog. Maybe tomorrow.",

Their Maxwell Street polish is decent though.    Their burger . . . umm, no comment.  I have found a nice bright spot on their menu, and that's their Greek Salad with Gyro meat.  I have issues with it, because along with the lettuce it came with only maybe 6 cucumber slices, 4 olives, 2 rings of red onion.   It DID come with a TON of gyro meat though.

Store bought, store brand bun, not toasted and soggy. Ick. But again the fries are good! So that's something...  One of the most poorly made meals I've had claiming to be Mediterranean or greek food. The pitas were bread like, and dense not light and with air pockets. Kind of like a grocery store pita if you have ever had to substitute these last minute in a meal you will understand the difference.  The lettuce on the platter was a whitish iceberg that wasn't green in the slightest. Tomatoes where the white kind that you would find on a Wendy's burger. Honestly the meal just lacked anything good. This was more comparable to a fast food quality than a sit down restaurant charging around $10 a meal. Places like Hummus Xpress or Byblos provide much better quality food and ingredients. Super sad that the quality wasn't better, as this place is right across the street from my house.",

I called in an order and asked for a gyro with hummus instead of tzatziki. The nice girl on the phone said \"oh okay... sure!\" When I came in to pick it up, the owner was over her shoulder at the register and saw that she hadn't up-charged me for the substitution. He proceeded to aggressively scold her in front of me, ending with, \"and now YOU get to tell her it costs more.\" That's totally fine, I have no problem with the up-charge. What I do have a problem with is the terrible way he treated his employee, and total lack of discretion. Not that it would have been excusable to talk to anyone like that in private either. I'll never go back and support his business, that's not how you should treat your employees, or anyone for that matter.",

One example... She gave my friend her bag of food and when she noticed that my friend had napkins in her hand, the owner reached into her bag and took those napkins out.

I will admit, I've had better gyros before.  However, Niro's gyros do pass muster and solidly qualify as good and rather nicely sized.  I just wish it was a bit less price wise as some of the other places where I have had gyros have had similar quality for not so much.  The restaurant itself isn't swanky but it's nice for what it is..a family owned Greek joint.  The staff is also usually quite nice.   Overall, I'm not sure I'd suggest crossing the Valley to try it out, but if you're in the general area and have a bit of a jonesing for Greek eats, I'd suggest checking it out at least once.",

Well I guess I have only myself to blame for not checking it out earlier.  The gyros are quite good, and contain plenty of meat.  The gyros also pass the required 2-hour post consumption test (they don't wipe you out for the rest of the day :)).  Not the greatest gyro I've had, but a very tasty gyro, and eager to have again.  Niro also serves other chicago style fare (italian beef, hot dogs, etc.) and its good to see the owners behind the counter; quality restaurant.  Catering is also offered.",

When I called in my order I was told that at the time they do not take orders over phone anytime in 30 minutes before closing unless you are within 5 minutes of the restaurant. I told them we were on our way, and was told we could order then. When I arrived at the location, they locked the door and turned off the lights, even though they still were supposed to be open for another 7 minutes. Given that gyro meat is constantly cooking and does not require more than 3 minutes to make a gyro, and the fact that they closed up when we arrived told me everything I needed to know about this restaurant. They wanted to close up early,  so they screwed the customer, me. The only thing you need to know where is this, don't go there. Because obviously they have really crappy customer service and if they do really crappy customer service you don't know what they're doing with your food.",

I'm basing the number of stars I have given on the quality of the food. We ordered the double order of gyros .. Half regular & half chicken. It came with 2 large portions of meat, onions, tomatoes, & gyro sauce. By far, the best thing on the plate was the gyro sauce. The chicken was dry & tasted weird. I personally thought that the regular gyro was a little bit better but not by much. Additionally, as a side, we upgraded to the Greek fries, which was a mistake. The fries themselves were good (especially with the gyro sauce) but for $1.25 extra, it was not worth it for the little big of feta cheese sprinkled on top & a lemon wedge.  I will say that for the amount of money that we paid, the quantity was large. There are quite a few other Mediterranean places in town that I would prefer over this for the quality, however.",

    "text": "Fabulous. I know this is a gyro place, but I get the chicken Picado pita. It has chicken, green bell pepper, onions and jalapenos on a pita with tzaziki sauce I believe. To die for! It has a little kick to it (which I love) and you can order it with a side of Greek fries (fries with feta cheese and lemon... Mm). My boyfriend gets the classic gyro. He loves it, but I'm just not a fan of gyro meat. I'm sure anyone who is would love it, though. It has very interesting interior and it is owned by a sweet couple from what I remember.   If you like a little heat in your pita, order the chicken Picado. If not, keep it traditional with the gyro. You won't go wrong either way.",

A friend took me to another Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood and boy was it disappointing by comparison.

The building looks humble enough. Very clean. Very cute inside. I guess they've been here for years. The tables inside are laminated with business cards painted on them of local area businesses. Bet they're glad they chose that form of advertising, good ROI. I've heard this place stays VERY busy. Glad I came during a quiet time. So peaceful. The Little One at the counter was darling. She looks you in the eye and holds intelligent conversation. It's great to see that much postive vibe come forth from our youth, Our Future... My friend's Gyro and greek salad looked amazing (wouldn't give me a bite, though). I ordered a Chicken Sandwich, no side -sub Baklava. The dessert was very sweet and sticky, best served cold, but seems the layers were little dry- not right kind of flakiness. Chicken- AMAZING! All fresh ingredients. Both meals a feast. I recommend to all!! Next stop: Perhaps, The Grand Canyon!",

Their hallmark is the Gyro meat which is not greasy like you find in many places.  Niro's even makes their own house tzatziki sauce which is pretty tasty and the sandwiches are very large in fact their sandwiches are large enough for two.  Niro's must be a local favorite from the looks of the  line at lunch however, the service is fast and friendly. The prices at Niro's are very competitive.  In fact, the average lunch costs less than what you would pay at many fast food chains.   Good service, compare prices, and tasty food. Give this place a try if you're ever in the area.",

The rest of the review, and the upgrade from one star to two, honestly goes like this...  Food: 2.5 out of 5. The gyro was good, comparable to other good places. Fries were hot and seemed fresh, but not plentiful. The hummus was truly the worst I've ever tasted, it was actually bad,...and I'm a tolerant eater. It was bland and sour, too cold and thick and pasty.  Atmosphere: 2 out of 5. Colorful, but dirty. You eat on carpet. Carpet in a dining room? It's dirty. Tables and chairs are old and not terribly comfortable.  Service: Girl at the front was sweet, but completely uneducated about the menu. Owner, we covered that.  Pricing: Not great. Pretty expensive for the quantity and quality.  Would I go back? Nope. There are other gyro/Mediterranean options in the area.",

    "text": "So, after have passed this place hundreds of times going to Safeway, I tried it. Granted it wasn't even my idea - but I tried it just the same. Once inside I realized that my expectations were correct and the options were limited. I usually do not think this is a bad thing, since I rather have an establishment do something well and only serve that than going big and doing a half-assed job.   I had the gyro, low-carb version which is basically a gyro but no bread. I cannot have bread at this time, so I had to go that route. In a styrofoam box I got meat, salad, onion and tomato - and on the side some tzatziki.   I was not blown away. The meat is ok, even if it isn't what I was hoping - at least it was what I was expecting. The salad was fresh enough, but so few ingredients. It might be something they gradually have cut down on just to save money, I do not know. Since there is an option to double the meat I cannot get disappointing on the portion. Absolutely ok for lunch.   But the biggest disappointment was the tzatziki. I mean, yogurt sauce in all honor but there is no shame in flavor and that flavor should be garlic. I tasted no garlic, and I tasted not much of anything but a saucy yogurt sauce. I wanted this to be the highlight and it wasn't. I can see myself going back.. but now I know what to expect.   It is a family owned business, so I give them all props. We need this.",

They were not as thick as steak fries but reminded me of them in the crunchy outside, soft potato heaven on the inside. A bit disappointed they charged $0.30 for ranch but it was worth it for the fries.

The fries come in a tiny brown paper bag, and are very good also.  The service is super fast!  By the time we filled our fountain drinks and found a table our order was ready.  We were there for lunch and it was pretty busy, but they were serving up orders like crazy.  It also seemed very reasonably priced.  My boyfriend and I ate for $16 which is very cheap for us.  The portions are huge.  We were both stuffed after our single pita sandwiches and were only able to finish one order of fries between the two of us.  Which is unusual because we always finish our food...lol.  Definitely recommend you give this place a try.",

My friends also like the chicken artichoke pita, though I'm not a huge fan of chicken gyro meat in general. The service is always really friendly and the food is very reasonable priced. My only complaint would be about the decor - faded posters showing gyros and hot dogs really don't do it for my appetite. Luckily the food is so good I can ignore the visuals.",

I even really liked the fake cheese sauce that came with the cheese fries ( sue me! ). I found the interior very clean for a small \"greasy spoon\" not as dumpy as you would think.

I've actually been to Greece and had a gyro there, it's been a few years but honestly I absolutely loved the gyro I had at Niro's today and it may have even surpassed the taste of the one I had in Greece.  The gyro was huge and pilled full of the delicious meat, I wanted to order another just because my mouth wanted more but one was actually very filling. The gyro sauce tasted like tzatziki but possibly made with sour cream instead of yogurt, it was really good.   I had a Greek side salad as well and it was great, so impressed that they actually make their own salad dressing. The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, perfect for lunch dining. I definitely want to go back and try the other sandwiches on the menu, including the chicken gyro, italian sausage and meat sandwiches but I loved the gyro so much that I'd hate to go back and not have one of those also, conundrum...",

Their new yellow rice tastes amazing. My favorite is the hummus platter. I usually make/eat roasted red pepper hummus, but I like their plain hummus much better than their red pepper flavor. The platter comes with the choice of hummus flavors, pitas, cut up tomatoes and cucumbers. I do wish there was more cucumber.   Another great dish is the the falafel platter. Best falafel I've had in a while and that is my go to when I get Greek food, so I have a lot of crappy falafel by which to compare. I really do like the baklava, but for the price, I thought it was homemade. Was kind of sad when I saw the girls putting it out in plastic containers straight from the box. Maybe the vivid could come with that for an extra dollar or so? Maybe do that packaging in the back? The only negative is the bathroom is subpar, but if you don't have to use it, then don't worry about that. All of the workers are always friendly. Plenty of seating, lots of pick up orders.

This continued for literally 10 minutes only to hear her make a comment about how she doesn't have time for pick up orders and proceeded to hang up on me. I decided to call back thinking it must have been a mistake only to be asked to be put on hold again, I told her I would appreciate her taking my order considering I was already on hold for 10 minutes and was hung up on and instead of trying to remedy the situation and my frustration she proceeded to immediately hang up on me again. Considering this is a local business I would hope that they would care about each and every customer that tries to support a family owned business but that was clearly not shown in the way this particular employee treated me.

    "text": "I have been coming to Niro's Gyros for 15 years. I used to live in Ahwatukee and now drive all the way from the border of Queen Creek/Gilbert to indulge on their juicy delicious gyros. However today I was in shock to see that the original owner was nowhere to be found and so much has changed from the service to the food.   First thing is I can't stand in today's non-serving related restaurants is when they spin a touchscreen around expecting a tip with recommended percentages. Your meals are expensive enough considering there is no server for drink refills, utensils, etcetera. If I choose to leave a tip let me put one in your jar, not with expectations on a screen because I choose to pay with a card.   Secondly, you need to get the recipes right. I drove 30 miles expecting the tender and juicy Gyro meat that I have enjoyed for more than a decade just to be let down by dry and slightly burnt meat instead. If you're not going to do the \"Niro's Gyros\" Name justice with their recipes, than change your name already. Quite frankly I could've found cheaper and tastier Gyros closer to my home than a sad excuse posing as a former staple in the community.   Lastly, part of why I supported this restaurant for years was the ads that were listed on the tables from small businesses in the community and local car dealerships. The old owner supported the local area and this was a huge part of the charm. This was completely missing as all of the tables have been covered up.   Whoever is running the show now should really take my review to heart. You're not going to have the long standing success of the previous owners if you can't duplicate their excellent food, service, and commitment to the community.   -A Very Disappointed Yelper",

I would be willing to try the Gyro since everyone says the place is good but wouldn't order the salad again.  Nino's on 16th is the best just unfortunately isn't close.",

The service is quick, the food is fresh and filling and a great value for your dollar.  We had a catering need and were tired of the regular pizza and mini-burrito platters, so we decided to give Niro's a shot at our lunch catering - what a great choice!  Pauline was a delight on the phone, helping me to figure out exactly what would be needed for our group.  She even offered suggestions for our vegetarian staff that didn't just include a salad.  Next, Theo called the morning of our delivery to make sure that our order was correct, he was exactly on time with our food and even called back in the afternoon to ensure that we enjoyed everything.  Customer service WIN!  Come for the gyros. Check out the chicken. Have your fill of falafel.  Ignite those tastebuds with some Feisty Feta Dip.  It's all good.",

For those of you who don't like lamb the Chicken Pita's are legit too. This place has comfort food favorites like Philly Cheese Sandwiches and Chicago Dogs.

    "text": "Where to start? Perhaps Greece? That is my recommendation to Niro. I think because this family restaurant is located in the dessert, there is a belief that locals have nothing to compare it to as you would in Chicago, New York, or Philly. If this place was in one of those cities, would they stand out? Sadly no. But, when we consider it being in Ahwahtukee, we give some grace . Diaspora longing for their ethnic fix of packed pita pockets plump with processed lamb and beef, prepared possibly by expats of any part of the world...will be pleased.  But let me throw this in. There is no seen evidence by Niro to be anything but an iconic representation     of what a Greek fast food place would be like run by someone not Greek would be like. It saddened me for example to not see fries done as they do in Greece, and salads without tomatoes and cucumbers (mostly lettuce) and not even the occasional greek song playing on the sound system. Still, Niro did pack my sandwich with meat. That deserves distinction. If they would also not be sparing with the sauce, it would be much better. I purchased more for $0.60. I am not sure what the extra cost is to get the sandwich hot. Mine was actually cold. But I ate it quietly thinking about how I might be able to make a return trip and not  expect more. Can I?",

    "text": "My lady and I finally got around to eating here and did it disappoint.  I ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich, she an Artichoke Chicken Pita Sandwich.  First, the meat in my Italian Beef was bland, really bland.  I was sprinkling salt on my sandwich.  I can't remember any time I ever sprinkled salt on anything, after it was prepared.  I opted for hot peppers over the sweet (Actually, I asked for hot & sweet but he said it'd cost more for both.  Yeesh.).  I didn't see or taste any.  I asked for the sandwich to be dipped but I was expecting, y'know, an actual roll.  The 'bread' must've been like those premium hot dog buns that Costco sells because it just mushed up, completely.  That's probably what bummed me out the most because when your teeth just break the barely crusty exterior of that roll and the au jus bursts from the inside, that's what you get Italian Beefs for.  Just mush at Niro's.  I just asked my lady what she thought of her sandwich, \"It was plain and didn't fill me up.\"  Now, my girlfriend isn't the hearty eater that I am.  She's pretty slim and rarely finishes anything.  She's also allergic to onions so is used to having food that has no flavor (Heehee).  For her to say those things, it's bad.  We shared a side of fries and they were good, though. Not great.  We won't be visiting Niro's again.  I recommend Chizona's Pizza for a good Italian Beef, if you're in the Scottsdale area.",

    "text": "First visit was very enjoyable. The gyro meat was notably less greasy than other Greek joints I've been to. The gyro sandwich itself was great - nice toasted pita, fresh tomatoes and onions, plenty of meat, and the sauce was nicely buried inside. Was so good grabbed a second one! Knocked one star off for pedestrian fries but added it back for helpful staff and very relaxed atmosphere.",

I could only eat half of it, and the leftovers made my fridge reek of gyro meat for a couple days. Also, the fries, leftover, were a little gritty the next day.",

    "text": "Low quality Gyro. Practically thrown together in literally 3 min. I asked politely for cooked grilled peppers and onions she charged me an extra buck. They did not dice or cook them at all. No shears ever heard. Their meat is microwaved BS. The meal cost me 13.27 I got a drink a fry a gyro and Chicago dog. the fry was not well done when had specifically asked.... When I got the thrown together meal. I asked for a side of Ranch and the register girl goes into sales mode. This was not a very good meal. Not happy with their customer philosophy. Your going to nickel and dime some one that just ordered a 13.27 value, and assured them I will never be back and you should think twice before going to this frugal gyro joint. Sh**thole",

    "text": "From a veg point of view this place was a total flop. The online menu shows a fish sandwich, however in store the menu item was missing.  Unlike you usually Greek esque place, there is no falafel. I resorted to hummus $2.95 and for that price it does not include any pita, so I was forced to order a peta for $.90  The hummus came in a small Styrofoam cup not worth the $3 and the pita was soft and warm but again worth nearly a $1 I think not.  Most of the menu is beef gyros, gyro meat plats or gyro sandwiches.  There are a few salads on the menu but I am not a salad person.  I think I miss the pizza hut that used to occupy this location",

    "text": "Would've been 5 stars if the Au Jus for the Italian Beef wasn't so spicy! First of all, Au Jus is French, not Italian, but a good Chicago style Italian Beef should have juice. Au Jus means \"it's own juice\", so it's the juice from the roast beef. Making it spicy doesn't make sense. If I want it spicy, I can add the spice, but if I want it mild, I can't take the spice away.",
