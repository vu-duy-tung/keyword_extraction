    "text": "With a little trepidation... I will leak my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mac's is a nice little neighborhood bar, nice selection of brews on tap, good food of a great variety and excellent staff.  Its location is what helps make it a standout, it is in one of the best strips in all of Phoenix.  Book-ended by Tempe's best bookstore and Tempe's most in-touch record store, this is the perfect place to start or finish a weekend morning.  The thing about the breakfast here is that it has two of my favorite qualities:  good and cheap.  Not cheap ingredients, nope.  Apple cider bacon, pecan pancakes, heavy and delicious huevos.  All of their offerings center around 6 bucks.  In Tempe, which is notoriously over priced in the early morning offerings, that is very cheap breakfast.  The light enters the room just right in the morning, casting amber hues around the room as you sip coffee, listen to pretty bad music and enjoy your hearty breakfast.  Take a stroll to Trader Joes, buy a few albums at Hoodlums and work up an appetite for Tott's (which is right across the street).",

I've been known on occasion to drag my tired self in there on a Sunday for breakfast and mimosas.   The food is good pub/American fare and the wait staff is pretty friendly. (I snarked at one poor server for calling me \"ma'am\" but he rallied and we're now on a first-name basis.) I'm a fan of the breakfast burrito. The huevos rancheros are okay but not very spicy. The queso is tasty and they have a sinful grilled cheese sandwich. Plus, I like that they have Sunbru and Smithwick's on tap.  Mac's is sandwiched between two fantastic Tempe gems - Changing Hands Bookstore and Hoodlums Music and Movies. I definitely recommend you shop BEFORE you eat/drink, though. Trust me! I've learned from experience...",

Sometimes they are understaffed, which can be a bummer if you're hungry.  Aside from that, their food is top notch (for a bar/grill), the environment is warm and friendly, and the drinks are always good and cold. Try the cajun shrimp appetizer or the spicy roast beef sandwich.  Hell, even the chili is great, especially paired with a frosty Odell IPA.  I could probably eat here three to five times a week if Providence allowed.  Support your local family eateries!",

I'm not sure why since we both wanted breakfast, but I'm all about checking out new places in his hood since it is super unfamiliar at this point.  The breakfast menu is meat tastic.  No spicy veggie omelet for me.  I decided on the grilled cheese and Cajun fries.  It all went down just fine but it came up a couple hours later.  I have a stomach of steel so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I ended up spending my Saturday afternoon laid up and pukey.  Not cool.  I don't think we'll be returning.

What happens when you graduate from college and walking across that stage to get your diploma also means you grow into a need for local hangouts where everybody still knows your name...just without the fight song sing-alongs and the floor so sticky you can't make it to the bathroom without losing a shoe?   Mac's Broiler & Tap is a quiet neighborhood hangout that still has that ever-present Tempe college spirit...for grown ups. Delicious bar food is abundant, beer is flowing from the tap, great daily specials and the service makes you feel right at home.   I stopped by on a Saturday night and found it crowded with enough room to move around and enjoy the place. We easily found two seats at the bar at cozied up for a few drinks and some good conversation. Drinks are reasonably priced and you will nearly always be greeted by a stranger with a friendly hello.   What may be it's strongest selling point is Mac's phenomenal location. In what may very well be one of the best corners in Tempe, Mac's is nestled in between one of the state's most amazing independent book sellers, Changing Hands and Trader Joe's grocery store. With so much going for it, make a day out of it!",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to just get my Sunday NYT and go to Wildflower Bread Company (next to Changing Hands bookstore) for breakfast/brunch. They have the best menu and it is open till 2pm for us later birds. Problem is on Sunday, everyone else has the same exact idea. Peeked in, no tables. Sure, it can open up fast, but seeing the endless coloured flags on people's tables meant no food, no turnover for a while.  So, my brother in his Jet's jersey, sad we were already 45 minutes into the game against the Patriots saw the Mac's Grill & Tap serves brunch and snagged a booth while I surveyed the sad, busy, non-turnover rate at Wilflower.  Sometimes getting a seat fast at breakfast is the only thing to be happy about. Oh, and they had like eight tvs set up so he could watch the game. Both of these traits earned the star.  The waitress gave us coffee (and a beer) quickly. Water took a while. Out of grapefruit juice. Let me get you oj. This goes on for like 15 minutes. And she hasn't taken our order yet b/c everytime she notices something, she runs away in panic and comes back an average of 5 to 10 minutes later. So she is trying. But there are two other servers, four other benches, a bar, two high tables and tables in the front that serve maybe 15 people, not including outside. Okay, there was another server besides then. Breakfast was meat heavy, but cheap. Don't have homefries (panic button!), only hash. Bad sign, b-fest people.  It ended up being at least a 25 minute wait. My pancakes were huge, rubbery (obviously microwaved), the eggs were runny, the hashbrowns greasey-and no freakin toast-apparently have to ask seperately for that (?!?). The bananas and pecans to be folded in-there was a generous topping of 4 banana slices and 5 pecans on top! Score! Unappealing.  I have passed by this place a lot since I frequent Changing Hands, Trader Joes and Wildflower in the same complex-and I will continue to do so. Catch a beer and some greasey food to watch the game if you are into that and happen to be at Guadalupe and McClintock. But for christs sake, next time, I will gladly wait the 10 minutes for a table at Wildflower!!!",

    "text": "We have been to Mac's twice in the past week as we happened to be next door at Changing Hands, once for a book signing and then again to pick up our signed books (that we had to leave because the signing ran late).  On the first visit it was fairly busy due to the book signing but we were seated in about 20 mins.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with a side of red potato salad.  Both were excellent.  My chicken had no fat, and was cooked well but still very juicy.  The potato salad was very flavorful.  My only small complaint would be that a few pieces of potato seemed a bit underdone.  No biggie.  My wife had the BLTTA with the French fries.  She really enjoyed the sandwich but found the toast to be a bit hard and had to ask for soft bread to transfer it to, even so, she enjoyed it quite a bit.  The bacon was very tasty.  The fries were skinny and crispy, but nothing special.  We thought about dessert, but the menu is a bit limited there, so we decided on the ZoYo place across the street.  On our second visit it seemed even busier (Friday night) although we were seated more quickly.  We ordered off the menu for the appetizer and asked for a fruit bowl, which they were happy to provide for only $4. It was a nice way to start our meal.  For dinner I ordered the 7 oz. sirloin with a baked potato.  It also comes with a roll (yummy) and some grilled (I think) veggies, which were cooked perfectly.  The steak was ordered medium and was perfectly done and delicious.  The only complaint here was for the baked potato.  I was asked if i wanted butter or sour cream and after saying sour cream I ended up with both but no other toppings (chives, bacon bits, etc.).  I guess the menu didn't say it was loaded, but I expected more.  My wife ordered the pasta primavera and substituted the penne with linguini noodles.  She was initially hesitant about trying it because she thought it smelled weird.  I tried it first and it was fantastic. The pasta was done perfectly and the veggies were still a little crunchy and the white wine sauce was awesome.  Great dish.  Both visits we had more than adequate service.  The wait staff was attentive and we never had a need to track them down.  These two visits were our only times visiting the place, but we will definitely be back!  It is a great place to eat while out record (Hoodlums) and book (Changing Hands) browsing.  The yogurt place across the street was great as well.  We had a great evening both nights.",

While we were seated quickly and a drink order taken, it took 5 minutes to get them from our waitress and when we ordered another , it was another 10 minutes.  Order was placed after we were there for 15 minutes and then it took 20 minutes to get a salad and 2 soups. Had to ask about our actual dinner after 45 minutes for it to come out cold.  We asked to have it warmed up and the manager came over, apologized and said they had some new people.  She offered to but a round of drinks but we were done at that point.  We had to hunt down our check, and when it arrived, she did remove a beer and an ice tea.  Bill was over $65, she should have taken off one of the dinners.  We've had an issue before but like to support local however, we won't be back and I highly doubt they care.  The table next to us got so frustrated they left after waiting so long for just drinks.",

The food is a bit overpriced for what you get and the vegetarian choices are almost none.  I got a 4 cheese grilled cheese.  It was good but not what I would usually order for dinner.  It came with a choice of sides and I got fruit.  It was a little over ripe.   The mojito I had was yummy though.",

But, on a Saturday, when the work is done - there's nothing wrong with that.  The bartender, who was fantastic, recommended the Cuban sandwich - which was on special.  My buddy swore up and down that the bacon bleu cheese burger was spot on.  So, like any respectable men would do, we shared half and half.  The only negative on the burger was that the bun wasn't worthy of every other ingredient.  Some times the meat and cheese are so perfect, that an ordinary bun takes away from the delish factor.  The Cuban, while good, was very messy.  When sandwiches are finished in a press, I expect there to be minimal mess.  That said, the pork inside was roasted to perfection and the pickles were tasty.  Add to this a couple of delicious micro-brews and it was a very nice surprise.  I will be back, and would recommend trying this joint to anyone in the area!",

Server pointed to a wall menu across the restaurant which we could not read from our table.  So far, not particularly impressed.  Ordered Mac's Queso Dip to start.  Delicious!  A good sign?  Fish and chips, average.  Tarter sauce is too much mayo and not much else. Spicy Jalapeno Burger?  Also average, at best.  Could taste the jalapenos otherwise not much flavor and it was served on two bottom buns.  Positive note, we both requested extra crispy fries and they were perfect.  French onion soup is good but not the best I've ever had.   Chicken and Candied Pecan salad was huge, had beautiful presentation and was good.  Overall, nothing to bring me back.",

Why only 3 stars you ask?    The first star is lost because the service is consistently bad.  Really bad, like you were forgotten about bad.  Bad enough that a number of my friends will not meet  me there for lunch based on past visits.  The other star gone because the owners are pinching pennies in all the wrong ways, like serving Tempe tap water that is clearly not filtered and tastes nasty.  The water is bad enough that the employees don't drink it.   I have complained about it a number of times, and they make it clear that it is a common complaint but haven't fixed it yet.     Also kind of a minor thing that other reviewers have noted, unless a customer specifically says no lettuce, tomato or onion, include all of them without having the server ask. I understand that the business owner might save a few pennies by not wasting food, but could probably make up for it by retaining more customers.  All in all I will still go to Macs from time to time.  I have a hard time recommending it to friends but will swing in for lunch and a beer if I am in the neighborhood.",

Reviews are a tricky thing because you don't know what the writer's frame of reference is, so I will tell you I like the burgers at Zin burger, the Grind and Deluxe.  The steak fries are nice too.   Their broccoli Alfredo, add chicken, is amazing. The chicken is amazingly tender and the sauce is flavorful, albeit thick, and rich so I suggest sharing it with a friend. Love this dish.   The sauce they make for their chimi appetizer is fantastic too - rich and flavorful. This is a great little spot, yes the service can be slow at times when they get busy,  but its good food in a sea of mediocre and national chains.",

No matter what you get, sandwiches, burgers or a dinner, they do a good job. Their breakfast menu is limited but everything we've had is very good.  If you arrive after 6pm be prepared to wait.

Mimosa is $5 and it's large and in charge, unlike zipps up the road, for example. I can't stand mimosas in tiny flutes.   Garlic wings were badass.   Servers (two) are outstanding and very mindful of making sure we are taken care of. She even asked for permission to serve my son another sprite.

The excuse this morning was that our order took so much longer than usual because I ordered my burger medium well...so it was my fault.  So a word to the wise...the food is good but the service is very slow and they (the staff) really don't seem to care.  Their attitude seems to be \"stay or leave\" we could care less.

It had huge pickeles and cole slaw on it, which I love in a pulled pork sandwich.

Had issues from long wait for food, to meat being tough or paying for an 8 oz primerib consisting of 5 ozs of fat and the server having an attitude that it was my problem and not theirs. Unapologetic and not willing to make it right has been the ongoing experiences we had there.  After much hesitation we gave them one more chance, and   now finally decided its our last. There was the three if us. Placed our orders and when food came, one ordered hamburger with no pickles or onions and asked for skinny fries, not the thick steak fries. None of the order came out as requested. My dinner I asked for baked instead of mashed potatoes. That didnt happen. The third person ordered medium cooked tri tip dinner special. And after attempting to eat a tough, hard to cut and chew tri tip meat they finally gave up and left half of it when server cleared the plate. Was asked how it was and said meat was too tough. The server said they would talk to manager but never came back to tell us what happened.  So I had asked the server, what was the managers answer and she said maybe they needed to have cooked the meat longer. And that was it. No manager explaining directly to us and neither an apology. Nothing, period.  What.?? Do you want satisfied customers?  I think not and definitely not returning ones. Period.",

Half the tables were empty but took waiter 20 minutes to take our order and another 30 minutes before the food arrived.  My husband chose the classic cheese burger which was big and done just right, medium but his frys were cold.  I ordered Mac's fish sandwich which was not what I expected.  The white fish was undercooked, translucent and slimmy.  I ate the lettuce and tomato and the bun along with the coldslaw.  Not a good 1st visit.",

    "text": "Hello,  I recently attempted to have dinner at your restaurant on Friday night, March 17th.  I wanted to explain why I say \"attempt\" because, even though we say there for 40 minutes, we didn't ever get to eat.  We came in around 7:30-7:45 on Friday.  The hostess sat us at a little table, right by the door to the patio.  The reason I am giving you a description is because I did not catch the servers name, but assume you would be able to know who was in which section that night.  We were greeted pretty quickly, ordered waters, and immediately ordered potato skins as an appetizer.  The server stated she was going to put in our appetizer and be back to take our order.  She returned a few minutes later and took the food order.  We then waited 35-40 minutes for our app.  It never came.  Our food never came.  I then went up to the bar and asked a different server to check on our food.  Our server was told we were missing potato skins, looked back at us confused, came over and said we never ordered an app.  I said yes we did, potato skins.  And she said, no she doesn't have one coming.  I then mentioned I was 2 months pregnant and NEEDED to eat.  She told me the food would be 5-10 more minutes.  I was so completely sick and starving, that my fiance and I could not wait, we were forced to leave and get a cheeseburger across the street at the Habit.    Here are my areas of opportunity, as someone who trains customer service for a living, and worked in restaurants for 10 years. 1.  Write orders down, especially if you are busy.  Customers don't find it impressive to use your memory, especially when you forget things 2. Fix the problem, don't push blame! 3. Go get my food asap.  I know you can call things \"on the fly\" when pocket tickets are completed. 4. Don't look at the customer from across the restaurant with a confused look 5. When people say they are pregnant and starving, help get me something to eat!  We live down the street from Mac's and usually visit once a month.  After this experience, I don't know if my fiance or I can ever return.",

    "text": "I would give them 5 stars because I have never, EVER had something bad from there. I manage the Baskin Robbins in the same center, and Mac's is our usual dinner to-go place that everyone can agree on.   I wish there was a 4.5 stars, they don't really need to have a 4, but I have to give a 4 because for a \"Tap\" kind of place, their drinks can be pricey. I would love a large 22 oz option instead of just pints. The pricing of pints can be $4+, but it is specialty beers, not just Miller. I love that they carry Sunbru. Additionally, one time it seems my salad was made by a completely different restaurant! It was odd, just 3 croutons and extremely soaked in dressing... but I've probably had Mac's 50-60 times over the last 4-5 years, which is such a low disappointment rate.    What I get: -BLTTA- Bacon, lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado... how can you go wrong? I don't eat Mayo so I usually get ranch on it, it's to die for! Probably my most favorite, but I have been trying to cut back on calories so I opt for the salads. -Chicken Caesar Salad (it comes with a sourdough roll which is seriously bomb!) -Chicken Caesar Salad Wrap- one of my favorites -French Onion Soup- good amount of cheese, is always hot and tastes the same every time I get it -The cajun fries are super good but I have to get ranch because I am a wimp. -You can get steak or regular fries, and plain or cajun. All 4 options are good. You can also get fruit which is pretty fresh.  Everyone loves the burgers, but I don't usually eat burgers. I did try one at the Christmas staff party we had there and it was good.   Breakfast is not only good, but inexpensive. I get the egg, bacon and cheese croissant  with fruit, and it's only about $6.  It is a family style tap, so I don't think taking my friends there would be appropriate, which is a bummer because if it probably had a couple more HD TVs and bigger glasses, they would need to expand AGAIN!   Overall: One of my favorite lunch time places, but would definitely go more if it was more of a drinking, not just eating type of place.",

I realize that restaurants, like people, have off days, but if the experience is a negative one every time I come it no longer is just an off day. I came here to meet with my friend. My friend was coming a bit later so I wanted to place my order. I was completely ignored by my server - he ended up sending another server to take care of me even though the establishment wasn't busy by any stretch of the word. Instead of bringing my food out immediately when it was ready, they waited an extra 30 mins for my friend to arrive and to place his order and bring the food out at the same time. Normally, this would be fine but obviously I wanted my food ahead of time - that's why I ordered it early. The food here is subpar. I've tried something new each time and am lucky to finish half of it. No seasonings and either a stale or soggy bun. We also tried to order drinks, instead our waiter brought out the check. When we tried to correct him saying that we ordered a drink he became argumentative. Save yourself the trouble, go somewhere else. I certainly will.",

The only hang up was that the person who took my order via the phone, conveniently forgot two of the people on my order, myself included. I had to stand awkwardly int eh bar area waiting for my food to finished. It didn't take long though. I would have appreciated an offering of water or a soda while I waited, but oh well.

The beef was lean and tender, and the au jus sauce was very good. If I have one suggestion, it would be that they offer a couple of vegetarian options, as I was actually interested in ordering something meatless that day and was not in the mood for pasta. How about a good spicy black bean burger and/or a good lentil loaf entree? These would be two vegetarian options that could fit in well with the menu's comfort food theme. Other than this, I had a good dining experience at Mac's and would come here again. I also love its convenient location near Changing Hands Bookstore. What could be better?",

I always get the southwestern shrimp that comes with wild rice and mixed vegetables (which are always great veggies, never overcooked and always fresh). I've had great experiences with sandwiches here - but everyone else has had great luck with whatever they ordered.   It's just a really chill place, and I would come here twice a week if I lived closer. Friendly service, and although sometimes a little slow, it's just a great neighborhood joint.

We were seated at a booth with ripped up seats in a really weird spot next to the servers station. Our waitress was awesome and really helpful with drink selections. They've got a nice selection of beers, and the lemon drop was perfect. The Reuben sandwich was delicious with tons of flavor. The sweet potato fries were ok but not great. We'll come back but it's not at the top of our list. Also, lame that they don't have pac12 network to watch ASU football.",

When we finally got our food our sides were ice cold. Our burgers were overcooked and our server was unapologetic. They did remake our fries when we told them they were cold.   All of these things seem pretty minor if they happen occasionally at a place. Unfortunately, this or something similar happens every time we are at Mac's.   We won't be back. An hour is too long to wait for an overcooked burger and cold fries.   Sorry Mac's we want to love you, but we just can't anymore.",

After a substantial amount of time passed, I revisited Macs. Underwhelmed with my overall experience would be an understatement. I waited about 8 minutes to be greeted by the bartender (which never happened, even though she was behind the bar for about 7 minutes of that time) thin brunette didn't catch her name because I ended up moving to a table in hopes of quenching my thirst... Let me be clear the server that I had was great, (shorter, very curly black hair) she was polite prompt and personable. However after taking my drink order and ringing it in it took the bartender 5 minutes to even grab the ticket off the printer and another 4 for it to get to my table because the bartender spent three minutes talking and finally decided to pour my beer for me. Corey dropped by my table while I was waiting for my beer to arrive, had a great conversation with him, really nice guy with a good beer knowledge we talked about a recent trip I had taken to Washington and some craft beers. Unfortunately his was the only name I caught, I wish I knew my servers name so that I could sing her praises. More than that I wish I had the bartenders name. If the Mac's owners ever read these let me give you one piece of advice. Your spectrum of employees is either amazing or awful. There is no in between. I hope that the next time (if there is one) I return to Mac's I am not greeted (even though I never was) by the same bartender, she made my overall experience awful and I will give Mac's one more chance before I cross it off my list of possible destinations forever. Until the awful portion of the staff is no longer employed it will be few and far between visits that I make to Mac's",

Yesterday I got the hot pastrami on rye sandwich special and I didn't eat dinner because it was so large and filling. The pastrami was delicious and salty with a unique mustard and ooey gooey cheese.  Tons of crazy delicious black and tan onion rings made with dark beer and an ale made for a great surprise.  Those things were delish!  They also have a solid beer list, and being a beer snob that is important to me.

I've witness employees drinking on the job on several occasions. My husband is allergic to cheese, when his order came out with cheese on it, we simply asked for it to be re-made. Our server was actually very polite and helpful, the owner was the one with questionable practices. Even knowing my husband was allergic, he simply washed the cheese off and tried to serve it to me again. That was the last straw.

But in hindsight, this place deserves a negative review.  My second visit was for lunch on a weekday (June 2016). I had the day off, which turned out to be a good thing, because being served lunch took an hour and twenty minutes total. If your restaurant is mostly empty, there is no excuse for this. Your job is to get the lunch crowd in and out. And if there is no crowd, well, we should be in and out even faster. The delays were a complete mystery. Surely the time was not spent on food prep. Please see my photo of the pathetic Buffalo Chix sandwich that finally arrived (Mmmm. Shredded iceberg lettuce and a lame bun with blue cheese glop).  I can only guess that the entire staff is family. They'd all be fired if they weren't. The highlight was a kid wandering the restaurant, endlessly wiping tables which he had just wiped down minutes before. Yes, like a total m**h head. He'd repeatedly ask the few customers present (myself included) \"You okay?\" As if there was anything he could do to improve the situation except continue to polish the finish off of your table.  Sadly, this spot is almost par for the course as far as casual \"American\" style restaurants in Tempe go. But almost any competitor is a better choice.",

I tried to email them directly about our experience thinking we could talk to someone with authority, (because the manager today was so rude and didn't help us at all) but their \"feedback\" email they have listed on their website comes back as undeliverable multiple times. So, here I am to do everyone else a favor. Spend your money somewhere else, ANYWHERE else.   My mom's food was cold when it should've been hot. It took 45 minutes to get our food. They weren't busy... but we had to track down our waitress to ask about our food because she ignored us up until then.   It's less about the food being cold, but the way it was handled. Or lack thereof. The waitress offered to bring my mom new bread (is she supposed to make her own sandwich?) and when we asked for a manager, some lady (she didn't introduce herself, she only said \"I heard there's a problem here.\") offered to bring new bread as well. My mom said she felt her food was cold because it took so long for us to get our food and it had been sitting out. The \"manager\" literally only said, \"I'm sorry you feel you waited that long.\" (Backhanded apology?) And walked away never to be seen again. Then NO ONE talked to us. We were never given a refill on our drinks, we weren't even acknowledged again, except by the waitress who was helping the table next to us. She came up finally and asked if we wanted boxes and refills and apologized for our experience. I'm sorry she was the only positive part of the experience we had.   The food is mediocre at best, cold (when it should be hot) and in a time when service is the only thing that sets businesses apart, this place is not worth anyone's time or money. Wish I could've talked to them directly, but they apparently would rather this be posted on Yelp for everyone to see.",

They weren't full by any means, but it seemed to take a while to be sat.  The staff was pretty slow and negligent - drink refills went unnoticed and doing other tasks seemed more important than checking on the customers (it wasn't just us).  Our food didn't seem fresh out of the kitchen when it finally arrived and on a school night, I had hoped to be home sooner.  I really wanted this place to be a new regular for us, but it just didn't happen.  That's okay - plenty of places to dine in the area.",

My steak was easily medium well, an obviously not a ribeye, very likely the sirloin cut they offer. Service was sub-par; no questions about how the food was, or prepared to our liking.  Did not see the waitress again until plates were ready to be cleared. No questions at that time either about my meal, even though 80% of my steak was left and cleared away. The vegetables and steak fries were very good though.  Probably a two and a half star place, but.... atmosphere, service and food all missed the mark.",

Thirty minutes later she said that she could have the cook poke his fingers into the potato to see if it was done or not?  Really, I didn't even want to eat it.

The breakfast menu was pretty short and offered NOTHING in the way of healthy. I understand it's a \"bar\" but I expected some oatmeal or something light I could snack on. Regardless, I did order the short stack pancakes with bananas and they were yummy (not healthy but worth it) and my mom's eggs benedict were tasty as well.  Our server was SUPER friendly and helpful! My issue was the $5 per mimosa, I asked several times to go light on the OJ but everyone came out the same, a little more than half filled and still heavy on the OJ. I drink out often enough to know my monies worth on alcohol and 3 half filled mimosas later I felt neither a slight buzz nor satisfied, neither did my mom (and she is a light weight!). In general I like this place and have good experiences but in the future will look somewhere else to have breakfast and a mimosa.",

Yeah, there is a bar, but, I've been there many times -- sometimes once a week -- and for the most part the people sitting at the bar are conversational and mindful that there are a lot more people there to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  (Mostly the latter two if your agenda is sitting on a bar stool for a while.)  Once, a guy was totally bombed and, well, a complete jerk.  But just once.  If you haven't been to Mac's in quite a while, they have doubled in size (the bird feeder store next door closed ... sad).  But, Mac's now holds twice as many diners, the wait staff has never been slow for me, the prices are great, and I've tried most menu items and each one was delicious.  So don't discount Mac's as a dive bar.  It's a restaurant; like many, yeah, there's a bar and a choice of TVs with sports games showing.  But that's really a small portion of the place.  Go for the food and the wait staff who remember you each time you visit (or that you haven't swung by in a while).  Mac's is outstanding among south Tempe's offerings.",

But this weekend, Mac's is participating in Hoodstock and donating 10% of it's proceeds to my stepdaughter's school, so we gave it a try.    We waited for about 15 minutes for a table, but were able to get a snack for our girls and a couple beers while we waited.  Toddler meltdown averted.  RIght when they seated us, some friends of ours came in, also looking to have dinner.  We asked if our table could accommodate three more people and another baby, and since it couldn't they opened a bigger table for us in the back.  Pretty cool, if you ask me.  Once we ordered, it took a while for our food to get to us.  In their defense though, I think they were pretty slammed with additional business coming in from Hoodstock next door.  I ordered the spicy roast beef, my husband had the a California chicken sandwich (something along those lines) and our girls split some fish and chips (hold the chips, sub a side of fruit).  The spicy roast beef is no joke.  Now, I'm no stranger to spice.  I like my wings HOT, I add extra tabasco to my bloody Mary's, hell, I ate hot sauce straight out of the bottle when I was pregnant.  But this sandwich took it overboard.  Heat can be a good thing, but not when it's the ONLY THING you can feel in your mouth.  I couldn't even taste anything else in the sandwich.  Finally, I picked off the jalapenos and it was much more tolerable.  My husbands chicken sandwich was great, and the girls fish was mediocre.  Not the best, not the worst, but pretty good.  I'm not a fan of skinny little french fries.  There's just not enough potato for me.    But, the service was fine, considering it was a packed house with big parties and lots of kids in there.  And I have to give them props for donating money to Broadmor.  Next time we're in the area and in the mood for some eats and drinks, we'll stop in again.",

The breakfast is great (although they changed their bacon recently and need to go back to the other one) and the BLTTA is fabulous!!  Nice variety of dishes so you're bound to find something to fit whatever you might be craving.  So, in easy to read bullet points here are the pro's and con's: Food - Great! Never had bad food here but of course haven't tried everything.  Portion size is more than adequate for the price. Service - super nice but yes...sometimes a bit slow.  Of course they occasionally surprise me with breakfast before I get thru 1/2 of my Bloody Mary! Music - they play older rock and have decorated the walls with album covers.  Way cool! Booze - Good beer selection (Four Peaks, Kona & standards.  Super Bloody Mary's!  I get double, spicy w/extra limes! Atmosphere - casual and a very local neighborhood hangout feel. Wi-fi - they don't have it but sometimes if the breeze blows just right...you can get a decent signal from nearby Wildflower. Kid friendly - i suppose but why bring them?  :-)  Happy Hour - basic happy hour prices but the board will announce daily specials. Specials - They always seem to have the burger and a pint special for about $9.  I recommend the burgers!!  Yum!  I hope you try it and have the same great experience I do.

    "text": "I really really wanted to like this place. We have been looking for a close local bar & grill in Tempe with good draft beer choices, good food and a comfortable atmosphere. We got there early (around 5 for dinner) and pretty much had the place to ourselves. The server was friendly and sweet, and pretty attentive but....and this is the main issue...the food was pretty awful. I ordered a patty melt which turned out to be a thin, dry hamburger with a few onions on top and very bland cole slaw. My husband tried a steak (over cooked for his med-rare order) and once again, bland potatoes and veggies. Overall nothing to rave about. Darn. We live in Tempe and like to spend our money in Tempe establishments, but I guess it is back to Chandler and Teakwoods!",

    "text": "Mac's has all the makings of a good neighborhood bar, except it falls short.  If you read my previous review, I really detailed all the great things about Mac's.  Unfortunately, the things I don't like are getting worse and outweighing the great things.  THE UPDATED STORY  The specialty drink menu is mostly gone. The bartender explained that it was more expensive to maintain the specialty drinks than were ordered. Fair enough, but that's one of the things I liked.  The food menu has fewer selections. Their menu of home cooking was one of the things I liked. Although, I did try the fried zucchini and it was actually outstanding for fried zucchini.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  But the real issue at Mac's is the UNBELIEVABLY LONG WAIT FOR EVERYTHING.   I just can't understand why it consistently takes FOREVER to receive anything, especially food items.   The waitress explained that they make each item to order and that there is little done in advance. But it still doesn't explain it. And I'm sick of trying to figure out why.   I notice in the reviews that other people have been experiencing the same issues.  CONCLUSION  I still go there if I know I'm in absolutely zero rush and don't expect anything special to happen.  It's disappointing to give a poor review, since it has such potential.

I didn't eat dinner after putting this meal down.   On the second visit I had Mac's Fish Sandwich. This is a nice alternative to the typical breaded and fried fish patties you are probably used to. Worth trying.   Service was great on both visits. The staff was very friendly and quick to take our orders, delivering our food without issues - like some other reviewers have reported.   On one of my next lunch visits I need to try one of their burgers. I've heard nothing but good things about them from everyone else and menu offers a lot of different options.

    "text": "I visited Mac's with my lady friend last evening, a Saturday night. There were only three or four tables with customers, and maybe five people at the bar itself, so not busy at all by any stretch of the imagination. I used to come here quite a bit a few years back, I now wonder why I should ever bother in the future.  The vacuous and indifferent host, a young man, acted like we were from a 19 century leper colony when we walked in...I imagine we had 'horned in' on his precious Twitter and Instagram activities at a bad time. He gave us menus and said we'd have a waiter 'soon'. Frankly the wait was like watching paint dry on a humid day...any longer and I would be collecting Social Security.   Finally, after about 15 minutes the phantom waitress showed up and said 'hello'...we said 'hi' and, being parched, we asked for water first. That took about another ten minutes...where she went and what she did in the interim was a mystery...maybe she had a casual chat with the help in the back kitchen. Certainly this person was no ball of fire. I hate it when service staff in a public venue act like they would rather be doing their laundry, or maybe scooping dog doo from their back lawn, than just doing their job to the best of their ability.   We were not starving so we ordered one Cobb salad and asked to split it onto a couple of plates. About twenty minutes later we got the salad, which was large and looked tasty...but alas, no plates nor any large spoons or tongs to use to fill the plates. BTW, it took almost ten more minutes just to get the two plates...I think she had to go to the Dollar store across the street to buy them. Forget about getting a large serving spoon or some tongs to divide the salad. It's evident that management and staff have not had any deep Einstein-like thoughts about providing some sorely needed utensils. I think Neanderthals  had more at their disposal to eat their food with.  The food is decent and ample, and the prices are a tad above average for this fare, but the service is so slow it could probably be timed with a sundial from ancient Greece. The owner of this place needs to be proactive and hire some wait staff that actually gives a d*mn about their job, and who act like it when they serve customers who are spending their hard-earned money. Unless Mac's get the incredibly slow and indifferent service straightened out I doubt if I will ever go back to this establishment...there are better places to spend your time and your money.

    "text": "Being called a Broiler & Tap , you may mistake this place for a bar of some sorts. While the setting is definitely bar-like, with the plasma t.v.'s on the wall and sports theme. Mac's is much better at being a restaurant than anything in my mind. If you're going, make sure it's somewhat early, they close at nine on weekdays and ten on weekends, I believe.  Every time I stop by Mac's I'll order the sourdough chicken melt, which is always delicious. I would branch out for a different entree, but with this one you can't lose. I still wonder if they get their bread fresh from the Wildflower Bread Company next store because it's always so fresh.   They always have perfect, crispy fries and yummy side dishes as well. Sometimes I'll order a glass of Blue Moon, but I prefer to dine at Mac's.    There's not a whole lot of seating inside the restaurant,  but they do have some more seating on the patio (as long as it isn't summertime).   I love the atmosphere here and can't wait to go back there.",

They ask how you want your burger cooked so it is just right and  which fries you want. I love being served by Julia Stiles doppleganger or Silent Bob. They do have deals for burger and a beer. Often there are only one or two tables open when we arrive for dinner which is a testament to the popularity. I would take friends from out of town here.",

Lotsa families - which is fine, but I've never seen a manager or anyone else out on the floor helping those girls out. I've tried a few different things there...from the lunch and the breakfast menu. Everything's always been great. When it comes out an hour later, you're so hungry that I guess it would taste better than usual. They make great bloody marys too.   Overall, it's a good spot if you're patient.",

    "text": "I've heard about this place before, but last night was the first time we went there. We wanted to grab an ice cream nearby at Baskin Robbin's but it was too busy. I mentioned food to the wife, and Wildflower is good but boring (if you go there a lot, like me). We were with our 4 year old and were told we could sit wherever we wanted, so we grabbed a large table in the back (all the booths were taken).   Elizabeth immediately came over to get our drink order. She was oleasant and never stopped smiling. The menu looked fantastic, and because we'd not been there before, we skipped the more expensive specials menu. Burgers are a staple of bar food so I wanted to begin there. I ordered a blue cheese and pepper corn burger with fries, the wife got the Maryland crabcakes, and we ordered the kid chicken fingers and fruit. My wife also got a cup of French onion soup, which came out relatively quickly.   We both love French onion soup, and it was pretty peppery the way I like it, and it was more of a tomato base like she likes. Good for both of us. We asked for the kid's food as soon as possible since it was after 7pm. A short period of time, her battered chicken came out piping hot. We cut it up and the wafting aroma made our mouths water. We both tried a bite the battered breading cover was savory. We're not sure what it was but it was really tasty for fried chicken fingers. The fruit bowl was perfect for a child, and every  single piece looked great.  My burger did take awhile but that's because I always get them well done (can't stand reddish beef). It was more like an angus patty, and well formed. It was a light brown throughout, and the swiss I asked for was perfectly melted and a nice balance between a tasty bite and smooth finish.   My wife was in the mood for seafood when we went out, and she did order the crabcakes, which came with a house tartar that was different than I'd had before. It was a little spicier and richer. That smothered across the cake, with a little of the pickled cabbage from the plate, was to die for. I am not a big crab cake eater and I liked it; the wife said it was the best she's ever had.   The only reason it did not get 5 stars is 1) there is no wireless. I could run business meetings out of this place if it had wireless! and 2) my fries were burnt and terrible. They have those thin ones that get to crispy too fast. They should change to steak fries and I'd be very happy.",

    "text": "Excellent!  One word is really all that is needed to describe this place. It's a family-owned, cozy restaurant with a bar. Even before they expanded it was still family friendly, now it's somewhere I can go with friends for drinks or with my family for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I used to be a regular back when it opened and I can't believe I forgot about this place. It's the right size, not too big as to be loud, not to small as to have too much difficulty getting a table (at most times- watch out HH). Their happy hour is decent, their food is scrumptious and the staff is amazing! We had drinks on Thursday and then came back on Saturday for some biscuits and gravy last week. They are my new favorite place for biscuits and gravy! And a strong contender for spicy bloody Mary's. I love the wood interior. I think that's what gives it the warm and inviting feeling. Totally a neighborhood upscale restaurant. It's now permanently added as one of my go-to places for meeting people. Thanks Mac's for keeping it the same for so many years! Don't change a thing!",

    "text": "About 2 weeks ago I moved into to an apartment complex that is 1/4 mile away from the intersection of Guadalupe and McClintock. At this intersection there is upwards of 10 different dinner choices, the majority of them chain restaurants or fast food. Being of the \"shop local Tempe\" mindset, I ventured to Macs Broiler & Tap, a mom and pop joint sandwiched between 2 of my favorite places in Tempe: Hoodlums Music and Changing Hands Bookstore. I figured since it was in such good company, I would give it a go.   I walked in the door and walked to the (empty) hostess stand where a sign read \"Please wait to be seated.\" Being a good drone, I did just that, I stood there looking for the hostess for a good 3 minutes, waiting to be seated. Finally a girl busing tables looks over at me, apparently confused over why I'm just standing there, and says \"You know you can just sit where ever you want.\" So I go and grab a table, situate myself. And I wait. And I wait some more. About 10 minutes later a waitress comes over to me and tells me that she will be right with me. Five minutes later, she comes back and asks if I would like a menu. At this point, I've now been in the place for about 20 minutes. I wanted to say \"Yes, that would be just dandy. I would like a menu so i can order some food, which is the reason why I've been waiting 20 minutes.\" I bite my tongue and just say \"Yes, thank you.\"  The waitress grabs a menu for me, doesn't stick around for me to ask for a drink, and walks away. She returns with a water 5 minutes later, putting it on the table as she walks by, not stopping to ask if I had any questions or want something other than water to drink. By now I've looked at the menu, figured out what I wanted, and wanted to order. I try flagging her down, finally catching her attention, only to get a curt \"I'll be there in a moment.\" She meander's her way over, takes my order, and goes to walk away. I stop her and ask if I can get an iced tea with my meal and the look she gave me had to be akin the one she'd give someone who just demanded her 1st born child, a combination of confusion and incredulity and disbelief.   A bit later, she walks by again, nearly drops my iced tea onto the table (she never stopped walking), and continues on her way without a word. Armed with my glass of water and my reluctantly given iced tea, I began the long wait for my order, the Chicken melt sandwich. Continuing what appears to be the M.O. of Mac's, I waited for my sandwich. And I waited. And I waited. Then, get this:  I waited some more. I waited for over 35 minutes for my food, and not once did my waitress come around to see if i needed more water (i did) or more iced tea (I didn't, but could have used a top off on the glass as it's free refills). Just when I was about to flag the waitress down to ask why they didn't pluck, slaughter, and carve up the chicken into the appropriate parts BEFORE I placed my order, a she walks out of the kitchen with a plate in hand and brings a plate to my table, puts it down and walks away barely saying a word. In front of me is my chicken sandwich.   There was bread, chicken, bacon, cheese, and tomato's. Beautifully, they got my order correct. The cheese was melted, but kind of cold (as if it had been sitting there waiting for someone to bring it to my table), the bacon was very good. The chicken was a bit dry, but by this time, I was starving. All in all I was there for an hour before I got any food, and when I did finally get it, I was not about to voice a complaint and wait even longer. I understand that Mac's is not a fast food joint, nor was I expecting it to be. However, being \"Joe, party of One\" in a 1/4 full restaurant, I feel that I can expect to receive my food in WELL  under an hour. Hell, just by being by myself I should be in, fed, paid, and out in under an hour. The waitress never checked to see if the food was OK, never offered me refills on my water or tea, and basically pretended I didn't exist. For a local restaurant situated between two of Tempe's best Local businesses, I expected a lot more.   Needless to say, I am sorely disappointed with my experience at Mac's, what with high expectations due to positive reviews on here and from people I know. I never got my waitresses name and was basically treated as a nuisance and not as a paying customer, from the minute I walked in and stood at the empty hostess booth looking like an idiot to the minute I walked out the front door.    Bottom line? I could have gone to Trader Joe's to buy the ingredients, gone home, cooked, ate, and cleaned up in the time I wasted over at Mac's. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not.",

The meat is hand cut, ground in house and burgers cooked to order. They have many side options instead of fries. Happy hour is fun out on the patio. The food can take a little while to come out sometimes but well worth it. This is not a chain restaurant were half your food is microwaved.

I ordered a jalapeno burger medium well and my friend ordered the classic cheese burger well done, the waitress said it will take 20 minutes to cook which is a bit long but fine. After nearly 35 minutes of waiting our food came out, the burgers were huge but bland. Although the quality of meat was good I thought it lacked flavor! The spicy mayo and jalapenos didn't compliment the burger at all.   The fries were just fries nothing special. My friends burger was very medium and very pink, not well done at all. I am not sure why it took so long to get our food if the burgers didn't come out well done. I don't like giving local places so so reviews but I had to on this one.",

    "text": "\"The Mac's Attack\"     I assure you this is not about Mc Donald's, But instead it is about Mac's Broiler and Tap in Tempe, Arizona  I actually crave food from here!  That all by itself says a lot!  I am a \"foodie\"  But I don't really crave any certain kind of food.  That is until I tried the \"burger and a beer lunch special at Mac's Broiler and Taproom. At home my wife resticts us to white meat...Turkey, Chicken, Albacore Tuna.  One day a buddy and I tried out Mac's Broiler and Tap  6430 S. McClintock Dr. Tempe, AZ 85283  480-755-3050   Join their Fan page on Facebook It was a pleasant surprise!  Both of us thought the burger was the best we have had, I hear the French dip is also very good!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmacsbroilerandtap.com%2F&s=98dd1afbf04862f3886c10badb2abc82aaffcaec4d8c83cf7a09c838f8614e78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">macsbroilerandtap.com</a>  I have been there three times in the last month and I am never disappointed,  The burger is cooked to a \"Perfect Medium-Rare\"  My favorite is the Jalpeno Buger, cajun fries and a pint of O'dells IPA.    The Sunday Breakfasts are fantastic too!                                               This place has ties that go back to  The Firehouse Restaurant that served great steaks to patrons of Tempe from their location on Apache Blvd. for many years.  If you live in the area stop by and give it a try.  If you visit Phoenix, make this a must do!  I wish I lived closer to Mac's!!!",

I was just here with my inlaws and some of their friends from PA. Apparently, we've convinced them this is one of THE places to go for food when in the valley. And I couldn't agree more. I absolutely love their fish sandwich. It's one of the few that is grilled and not fried.   Their French Fries are the perfectly addicting kind of shoe strings and their rotating selection of craft beers keeps it interesting. Their mixed drinks are a bit of a crap shoot- not a fan of their \"macarita\".   Plus, as a local establishment, they keep things local. For example, this week is AZ beer week and when we ordered the Huss beer (another one of our local favs), the Huss beer rep came over to thank us personally for ordering their beer, gave us some free Huss swag and talked to us a bit about beer and running (a personal hobby that she overheard while I was eating dinner).   Macs is the kind of place that makes you feel like a local and that you belong there. It's my \"cheers\". Don't worry, I won't start singing...but I'm tempted.",

As in my prior visits, the wait staff was very attentive to our needs, check back multiple times to see how we were doing and in our drinks needed refillings.  For Lunch I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich on 9 grain bread  and Steak Fries.  The sandwich was very tasty with just the right amount of seasoning and mayo, so that it was not soggy and messy.  The others in the party ordered the French Dip with French Fries, and the Fish Sandwich with French Fries.   Both liked their sandwiches and on the way back to the office asked for the address several times, so they could return.  My only issue on this visit was that the steak fries were not as hot and crispy has I have had in the past, otherwise it would have been a five.",

Great place for regulars to hang out but was totally turned off by the owner drinking pints at with the bar patrons while we ate breakfast...made it not so family friendly and took off the professional edge and a few stars. Can't see how the improvements will last when drinking in the AM without regard to the impression this leaves customers is a priority to the owner.  Time to think about the underlying issue here.

    "text": "Stopped here unexpectedly last night (Friday) and was seated at a four-top even though it was pretty busy indoors.  I don't recall the name of my server, but he was oh so very patient w/ me as he tried to answer my food allergy concerns with everything from beer to specialties and the fish and chips (turns out his ex-girlfriend had food allergies, too).   I asked him for a beer recommendation since I've only started to appreciate beers; I've always liked fruity cocktails and sweet wines.  I've NEVER liked the taste of beers, although I did enjoy the sips of San Miguel light beer mixed with Sprite or Seven-Up that relatives would let slip for us kiddies to try.  However, with micro-breweries and seasonal brews a-plenty, I find that beer-tasting (and seeing which ones match well with food) can be as much fun as wine-tasting.  (Sounds like I've done a lot of beer-tasting, huh?  I can count the times I had a couple sips of beers on one hand!)  But I digress...  My server suggested a Blue Moon, which I almost didn't get to try since it looked like I was allergic to every dish I selected (he'd go to the back to double-check).  I think he could see I was about to bolt, bec. he suddenly appeared with a cold glass of Blue Moon, w/c came w/ an orange slice.  Since I didn't want to leave with an open bar ticket unpaid, I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the Fish and chips platter, even though the kitchen couldn't confirm that the batter was *-free.  Am I glad I did!  The platter took about 20 minutes to arrive, but when it did I was happily munching away on crispy, fresh-tasting beer-battered haddock, w/c I sprinkled with fresh lemon juice and occasionally dipped in tartar sauce.  Yessir, I was really living on the edge now!  *-allergy be damned!  I even sampled the itsy-bitsy side of coleslaw, w/c I'm pretty sure had * in the dressing.  Oh, and the beer tasted fine.  So much so, I almost bought a six-pack from Sunflower a couple of days later.  I'll be back to try other specialties and their burgers, of which Mac's is famous for.",

Immediately we were seated and waited on by Michelle who had the best upbeat personality we have encountered in a really long time. She told us all of the specials and helped us pick our meals. My 16 year old and I both had the ultimate grilled cheese which was absolutely to die for. My 8 year old had the orange stung chicken. Everything was delicious.

    "text": "My husband and I just finished having lunch here. When we walked in it was just opening and so we expect it to be a little bit slow to start and that's fine. The bartender was sitting at the bar on her computer and when we said hello she said hello and that was it. She came over and got our beer order and the beer was poured well. I noticed that they had a prime rib sandwich and onion rings on their specials menu and decided that's what I wanted. I have severe dairy allergies (not lactose intolerance) and when the bartender did not come back for more than 5 minutes I asked the gentleman server if anything in that order contains dairy product. He politely told me he would have to go into the kitchen and ask. He returned moments later telling me that there is no dairy in anything mentioned in that dish. I specifically asked if he double-checked the onion rings and he said he did. This made me very happy. I proceeded to order the special and upon arrival immediately noticed that the order was incorrect. Instead of onion rings I got French fries. I politely pointed out that it was incorrect and the bartender, whom never gave us her name, took it right back to the kitchen and brought me out the sandwich by itself on a plate. I thought this was normal and thought the sandwich looked good. But when I touched it, I noticed that not only did it feel different but it smells different as well and knew that it was basted in butter product. I pointed this out to the bartender and she went and asked the cooks and immediately came back out and told me that she was sorry and took my sandwich from me. I then sat there for 10 minutes while my husband enjoyed his sandwich while it was hot. When it came back out I double-checked with her and asked her if she would please check the bread package for allergy information containing dairy. She said then the bread was made daily and she was unsure about that kind of information and wouldn't even know how to figure that out. I trusted the waiter when he said it earlier,  but now I'm worried, so I took off the bun. Now, no longer enjoying lunch, I looked up the information on the black and tan onion rings and found out they also have dairy in them. As I sit here having to cancel my plans for the rest of  the day bevause I trusted my server and bartender, I am appalled at the way this business has handled itself. When someone comes into a restaurant and points out very specifically that they have a severe food allergy it should be taken seriously. I cannot believe that they dismissed the concern I had about my own health. The fact that in today's day a restaurant is still not taking allergies seriously is dangerous. I would never recommend this place to anybody and in fact had numerous conversations while picking up my kid from school today about staying away from this restaurant.",

    "text": "Friday night last minute and hungry and tried 2 other places and wait was 30+ mins~ Snap fingers.. Oh yea, Mac's! Its just around the corner from us! I hadnt been there since the kids  ordered from the kiddie menu.  Seated within 5 mins. The place was busy and  we ran into a few neighborhood folks. Mac's is a family/ kid friendly place with a down homey atmosphere. I liked the 70s and 80s rock band photos on the  walls. I ordered the  baby back ribs one-half rack simmered in a tropical boil. finished on the char broiler and brushed with mac's BBQ sauce. served with coleslaw and baked potato. I opted for Veggies instead of Potato. Veggies done  perfect , i like to see the color still on my vege. My ribs were divine!  Moist meaty and fall off the bone and lean.(nothing worse than biting into a mouthful of fat and trying gracefully to spit it out)  Macs Ribs  are by far better than a few rib places I have been to. And the value absolutely reasonable. Actually how do they stay in business with such reasonable prices?  My daughter got the grilled mahi mahi char-grilled until just done and topped with cashew ginger butter. served with rice pilaf and sauteed house veggies~ She loved it.   I had to try it  and was blown away! The fish tasted fresh fresh fresh and ginger butter made my mouth water for more more more! I have to say the  rice pilaf tasted familiarly  like Uncle Bens, at any rate I  am not  much of a rice eater in the first place. I had a great glass of Red wine, cant remember if it was Cab or Shiraz which is my go to Red of choice.  its literally 5 mins from our home and We cant wait to return!",

    "text": "Reasonably priced breakfast with large portions.  We had the huevos rancheros ($6.50) which was very flavorful and filling, and the pancake breakfast ($6.50).  The pancake breakfast comes with your choice of pecan or banana inside the pancake batter.  I chose pecan, and there were lots of toasted pecans in the pancakes providing a nutty crunch.  It was served with 2 eggs and breakfast meat.  I chose the ham, and it came out in a thick, large, grilled slice, a very good value for your meal.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the pancakes themselves were fairly large, and came in a stack of 2.  The coffee was nothing special ($1.50), but it did get refilled often by our attentive server.  All in all, a pleasant brunch for a Sunday late afternoon.",

So on Fathers Day 2013 we decided to try this for a fathers day meal.   And we were very pleased.   And being a chef for over 40 years I can be hard to please when it comes to food.   Even though the place was busy the wait staff was very courteous and prompt.  And the burgers were the best we ever had.   And I just love a good beer with my meal, and they more than met my expectations with their choice of beers on tap.   We will definitely return and have another very enjoyable meal.",

It's not going to thrill anyone but it's good at typical American bar food. I like that they always have an IPA on draft.",

The chipotle chicken sandwich was soggy, so I just pulled off the bread and lettuce and ate the chicken.  It tasted like dry and previously frozen, but it wasn't terrible. The coleslaw tasted like it had been sitting in a bucket for days. We pulled pieces of paper, which looked like they had come from a straw, from out of our little bowl, which I'll tell you, is pretty unappetizing. I won't be back.",

The steak medallions were weird: flavorless and slightly chewy and with the texture of boiled meat. Won't be going back.",

The tea is always topped off, When in Germany I listen to the Hoff, Sit on the patio and go ahead and stare, Hotties all around who just don't care.
