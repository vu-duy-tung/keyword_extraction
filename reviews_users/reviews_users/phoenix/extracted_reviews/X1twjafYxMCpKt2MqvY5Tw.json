On our way out of town, our 11 year old son randomly found this place online from all the great reviews, so we decided to give it a chance. Driving into the area, we thought we were taking a wrong turn, but there it was! We were doubtful, but can I tell you it was amazing! Not only are the owners just lovely, we had the best breakfast we think we've ever had. From the Rueben, the omelettes, the fresh baked bread, the bacon....everything was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend anyone to visit this sweet place. We would love to come back again!",

We were kind of afraid to eat it. We got pancakes, eggs and bacon. Pancakes were decent but my friend discovered old food stuck to the bottom of her plate while trying to enjoy. The man who served us looked dirty and like he didn't feel like serving. My friend accidentally spilled syrup on one of the menus and when he came to pick it up, we watched him take it to the back and show the lady working the register with a scowl on his face, looked like he mouthed something distasteful. The whole thing looked unprofessional and we were very uncomfortable. We ended up leaving with pretty much full plates. We weren't full yet..  Just didn't feel right.",

You'll definitely get your dose of scripture if you can find this tiny spot tucked in the middle of a very industrial area. I was traveling for business, needing to escape my hotel, and limited on time - so didn't have many options.  I didn't like... that my table was dirty (as were a couple others) in a nearly empty restaurant. As I sat, the place filled up a bit: prompting the owner/ employee sitting next to me to get up from his breakfast and help out (but not wash his hands first). Also... No fruit/ potato/ grit side options.  I did like... that my food came out quickly, the wrap I ordered was big and tasty. The coffee was hot and strong.   It's also an independently owned, little mom and pop shop. I dig that.",

    "text": "Wow is this just a hidden jem. Back on an industrial street. You wouldn't even know it was there unless you worked in the area but do they have really good sandwiches. Sure I have only been twice and not 70 plus times like some people. Lol. My really good friend Cheryl B, the 70 plus timer, has been raving about this place for a while now but it was just a little too far away from my work to go there for lunch. Now that I have more time I was finally able to give it a try. She was right. It is really good. The Tuesday special is a Turkey Relleno sandwich, my fav so far. It is a cross between a turkey sandwich and a chilli relleno, which I didn't realize at first, but wow it is so good. Just the right amount of spice. The owner, Peter, is either behind the couner or sitting at a table with his wife, who is also part owner, having some of their great food. They are both very nice. The place is not that big. Just a few tables inside and only a couple outside. It is a very nice and clean place. Simple. Nothing too fancy. The food says enough. The prices are very resonable. Especially for how good the food is. Everything was cooked just right and very fresh. Even the bread was amazing. The Patty Melt they have on special on Thursday was also very good.  If you are in the area definitely stop by and have a sandwich. My recommendation is to go on a Tuesday. Then go a bunch more after that. Why not finish out the week there. I will definitely be back. I want to try the Monte Cristo sandwich next plus all of the rest. A nice little Mom and Pop breakfast and lunch spot. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed.",

I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with wheat toast and sausage.  Not to mention for a very reasonable price. Looking around I could see that this place felt like home. There were customers laughing and having a great time as if they never left. I took my first bite of food and was amazed. Everything was perfect. The cook was extremely nice as well as the cashier. When I'm on another adventure I will surely come back and fulfill my destiny to feed my stomach at morning star cafe.",

I was already prewarned to call my order ahead, which I did,  I have to be honest I really didn't look at a menu, I just asked my besty what her favorite thing was and that's what I tried.   What did I try you asked?? Well I ordered the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and it was delsih!  It had chunks of chicken breast, diced green chilies and melted mozzarella cheese, this sandwich was amazing!!! Loved it, the flavors of everything was so fresh, it reminded me of homemade green chili for burritos, but instead severed on a sandwich, which worked, I would have never thought of doing that, but that's because in my house we use tortillas more than bread .  I also grabbed a brownie/cookie because it looked too good to pass up, and man was I glad I did! Deliciously sweet!   Glad I gave Morning Star a try, I do have to admit I did past the place up when 1st looking for it, didn't know it was in a industrial area, but now that I have found it I will be back more often, and calling in my order ahead worked out perfectly for me too!",

Given coffee as soon as I ordered, always nice if you need coffee first. I got the grilled egg sandwich w/ bacon. So delicious! Eggs well cooked and nicely seasoned, bread is a beautiful soft roll-like bread. Two slices of cheese on top and bottom. Perfectly cooked delicious bacon folded into the egg.  As others have said, keep your eyes out for it, it can be hidden by the trucks that park out front along the road. Very clean and well kept. I'm usually turned off by religious/God references in places but these are subtle and not in your face.   Very satisfying and a perfect start to my day, thank you yelpers!",

The omelette had at least three eggs and a giant pile of perfectly sauteed spinach and tomatoes with fresh cooked thick bacon nicely diced inside. The eggs were perfectly cooked and  hot when it came to the table. The rye toast was thick and buttery.  Coffee here is incredible.  The owners were very nice folks - told me they have been here for 14 years and get their coffee roasted fresh weekly and bread delivered daily. The focus on quality and attentive service is quite apparent.    I'll be back and encourage you to try it.",

To start we had coffee and tea (great selection of hot teas) and a homemade triple berry muffin with blueberry, raspberry, and blackberry. I had the Tuesday  daily special of turkey relleno sandwich and he had the one egg breakfast with sourdough toast. We even got a broken molasses cookie on the house which was lightly sweet and chewy. Very friendly and welcoming with decor that made you feel homey, like you were in someone's kitchen not a restaurant. They had a really cute patio area too! We're from out of town but we will return when we are back in the city and I'm telling all of my local friends. It's little and tucked away without a big sign so be careful not to miss it!",

Why 4 stars?  ~Service went along way, staff was personable and seemed to really care about the customers and I enjoyed the sandwich even though it was pricey.",

    "text": "The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, \"I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity.\"   I was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.  Furthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that \"You whites have been stealing from us for years.\"  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...  Sir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business.   If you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place.   If you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look.",

He lost me after he brought up \"all the black people\" and yes, used the \"N\" word.  Yes, that \"N\" word.    I don't know why this man felt he could be so candid with us, but I gotta imagine-if this is his public face I'd hate to see what he's like as a person.  The most baffling thing to me is the place is covered in his Christian beliefs-it's everywhere-normally a turn off for me but the food is decent.  How can such a \"devout\" Christian be such a hypocrite...and therein lies my rant of how super duper Christian folk usually turn out to be \"not so\" Christian.  Appalling.  That's all I have to say.  His daughter is very nice-hopefully she hasn't picked up the same beliefs as he has, or at least she is smart enough not to broadcast them.",

It was plenty of food and I couldn't quite finish it all.  I did steal a bite or two of my husbands pancakes-- thick, fluffy, and golden...who could resist?  The smooth coffee was the perfect compliment to a great meal. The only complaint would be a somewhat limited menu (no hash browns) Not enough of a complaint to detract from 5 stars!",

    "text": "I'm usually the one who takes people to new places they haven't tried before, but today, my good friend invited me to try this place out.  I'd seen this place a million times in my Yelp searches for good food near my place of work, but for some reason, I always skip over it.  I think it's because the main picture of three people clearly not standing in the actual cafe and the \"Caterers, Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch\" description probably led me to think it wasn't a sit down cafe.  Immediately upon entering, I noticed how hot it was in there, and my friend mentioned that they have no air conditioning.  I'm a fat guy, and we don't do well inside non air conditioned small crowded buildings.  I ordered a Ruben for myself and the turkey club for my lady who was back working hard at the office.  We grabbed a table which had a wobble to it and then waited in line to pay for our order.  We almost got skipped in line by someone, but my friend was brave enough to jump in and tell them we were next.  I could see the confusion though and if you haven't been there, you order on the right, and then pay on the left, BUT if there's a line on the left, get in it, don't jump over to your left.  Better yet, order ahead.  Once we paid, the food came out fairly quickly.  The owner brought it out himself, but, upon setting down our sandwiches, he proceeded to blame us for \"moving the table\" off of the napkin he had used to eliminate the wobble.  The Ruben was very good, good enough for me to not be completely annoyed by being accused of rearranging furniture causing it to wobble.  Fix the table and maybe don't blame people for moving it off the napkin.  That's all I'm saying.  Anyway, I'll be back for sure to try other menu items.  The salads looked amazing and HUGE and my lady liked the turkey club I brought back for her.  I'm often annoyed to see so many 5 star reviews for places here on Yelp.  I reserve 5 stars for places and food that is out of this world amazing.  This is a sandwich shop.  I give this place a SOLID three stars, taking off one for the fact that there is no air conditioning.  The other suites in the office park had wall mounted A/C units, probably wouldn't hurt to spend the $100 on one for the cafe.  The food is good but also a bit pricey for what it is.  I paid $15 for two sandwiches and an iced tea.  All in all, if you're in the mood for a really good sandwich, and don't mind the heat, come here and check them out!  I'm glad my friend brought me here.",

Soooooooo gooooood. The first time I only ate half and saved the rest for later in the day. Now I'll stuff the entire sandwich into my face and moan for a couple hours because I ate way too much in one sitting. The cakes and pies are delicious too. I try not to let my inner fatty eat here everyday. :)  The management and staff are very nice and pleasant to speak to while you wait for the delicious creations.",

You might not even know it was there were it not for a few covered tables on a make shift patio.  Really great food, super prices and almost disgustingly nice people who work there!    The place is so cute.  Black and white checkered tiles.  White bead board up to a chair rail.  Very homey without being overly kitschy.    While they do all the basics, and do them well, this isn't just your basic fare.  How about their Muffelatta for $5.15?  Or their Hot Sweet Italian sandwich - with sausage, onion, peppers and mushrooms w/ melted provolone cheese ($5.85)?  And their Spinach salad with egg and bacon for $5.05?  All good.  They even have a Monte Cristo ($5.15) on their menu! And their basics are great.  I had the Tuna melt ($5.05) on an employee's recommendation and it's one of the best one's I've had in a long time.  I haven't had their breakfasts yet, but I've got my eye on their Egg, Chorizo and roasted green chile wrap for $3.25.    And then there are their drinks.  Sure - when I saw I could get Hires Root Beer or Squirt with my lunch, I was stoked.  But then I saw their coffee menu.  How about a large (32oz) Iced Coffee for $2.25? Or a large Iced Chai for $2.05???  They also Cappuccino, Espresso and Lattes for similarly great prices.    But in the end, it's the folks who work there that have knocked me out. My first time there, the girl who took my order remembered my name and checked on me twice at my table - by name.  She wasn't a waitress, just worked behind the counter.  But when she came to clear a table, she just wanted to check on things.    I almost hate to give the place up, but the more folks who come by, the more likely I am to be able to keep this place around.  So I definitely encourage you to come by.  Even if it's to just grab a coffee and a baked good.  Yes - they bake things fresh on site every day.  Just one more layer of their oh so goodness.  If only they were open on Saturday...

The coffee is good and served in mugs.  There are also some tasty muffins to choose from.  Only negative to say is that they are not open on weekends (makes sense, based on location), and that you have to pull cash from an ATM if you do not carry cash with you.",

I had a huge (generous portion) of 2% milk for $1.75 and a cup of coffee, which I heard was some pretty great coffee. I liked it, yes, but I wouldn't rave that it was the best ever.   My colleagues loved this place. They said they can't wait to come back. Good!   I was able to talk to the owner about Yelp and how we all heard of this place. I'm glad I was able to do a lunch search in the area of Eba Cafe. This place is the perfect lunch spot, followed by a quick drive over for boba tea afterwards.   They serve breakfast all day. The prices are reasonable. And, like I said, it's super friendly. So, what are you waiting for? Go!",

Now for the bad news, NO HASH BROWNS......They said they don't have time to cook them because they primarily service a business community where customers need to come and go quickly, interesting to me especially since there appeared to be some sort of a mens group 6 or so guys meeting there maybe a bible study and the cook (I'm assuming the owner) even came out and sat at their table for a few minutes between customers and other patrons didn't seem to be in any more of a hurry than your typical american, therefore I call BS on their no hash brown excuse. The ham they serve is of the very thin sliced variety like you would get on a sandwich, not the kind of ham you usually get when ordered at breakfast. Finally with the large milk I ordered (very good and cold by the way) my bill was almost $9.00 & for that I got to use the cheapest plastic utensils money can buy and of course the fork broke while cutting my eggs, if your going to use plastic utensils at least get a medium grade please!  Personally there are much better options in Tempe.",

FANTASTIC  Fresh everything, passionate husband and wife team ready to offer suggestions.   Delicious, inexpensive. Really...for $5 I had a HUGE wrap with probably 3 eggs, chorizo (had the chorizo and chile---just enough spice) w/ a delicious salsa on the side.   And why Starbucks when, for about $2.50, you get a locally roasted cappuccino.   If I lived here, this would be my breakfast spot. An EASY 5 stars",

This place wasn't very busy but got pretty packed around noon. The food came out fast and the service was excellent   Good prices. Excellent company. Small, self owned business. (Christ centered as well) if that's something you're into.  I would recommend the chorizo wrap.. But I know my kids had pancakes and other breakfast things... Along the green chili chicken sandwich!   Overall great experience and looking forward to coming back maybe on our trip and even next year!! (Because we will be back)",

We had the Monte Christo and the Traditional 2-Egg breakfast and both were outstanding. On vacation from Chicago and while we want to try a lot of places we already decided that we're going back for breakfast tomorrow :)! Highly recommend this classic \"hole in the wall\" location if you want a great breakfast with great people. Thanks!",

    "text": "This was my first time at the Morning Star Cafe, a friend told me about it or I might not have discovered this hidden slice of heaven  that serves breakfast, lunch and homemade desserts located in an unlikely area tucked in between business offices in Tempe. We both ordered the Tuesday special, the Turkey Relleno sandwich, made with their fresh sourdough bread, tasty turkey and melted cheese! It was not just the best Turkey sandwich but the best sandwich I ever had! The bread was so good she placed an order for pick up on Friday for 2 loaves to share and enjoy over the weekend. We also ordered their fresh baked oatmeal apple square to split but  both of us were so full from our sandwiches that it had to wait. Lucky for me I took it back to the office and later, yes I ate the whole gosh dang thing myself. The owner brought our food to the table and it was obvious that he valued good service as much a the greatness of the food he served. I took a menu with me and on Friday called to order a Chicken Chili sandwich to go,  which did not disappoint! I have already made plans to go again with a coworker next week, if I can wait that long, their 5 cheese grilled sandwhich is calling my name!  The only down side is that they're only open Monday through Friday 6am until 3pm, but I'm hoping to make it for breakfast and coffee soon. If you're in the area or even if your not it's worth the drive and a definite must try, again and again and again. PS Bring cash, they don't take cards but they do have an ATM machine inside to accomodate you in case you forget.",

The bacon was a thick sliced applewood smoked version, delicious.  Coffee was hot and good. They only do counter service. Very nice and courteous.  They cater to a interesting mix of people.  The restaurant is located in an industrial park next to a Safeway distribution Wharehouse. No signage to speak of. I arrived at 0900 and was joined by a pair of travelers and some utility workers. You know it's gotta be good because if not this little breakfast house would not exist. Don't blink when you go by or you will miss it!  Very good home style breakfast food and good prices. Run by a mom n pop.  Enjoy!!!!",

Morning star is actually just down the street from my house, so it is incredibly convenient to get to and easy to find.  The place wasn't PACKED but certainly had a good amount of customers coming in and out; a good sign that this place is know for good lunch time fare.  I decided on the green chili chicken sandwich and boy was I not disappointed.  If you love green chilies like I do, this is your dish!  Just the right amount of spiciness, certainly not overwhelming.  The quality of ingredients were high, fresh bread and juicy chicken.  Best of all, the prices are really reasonable!    I believe I met the owner and found him to be really sincere and excited about his business.  I loved the mom and pops feel of this place, and I can't wait to come back and try out breakfast sometime.    My only \"dislike\" was the coffee; it wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly was nothing exceptional.  It was really nice for the owner to give me a free cup so that I could try it out.    This place just gave me a good feeling all around.  It's a place I'm happy to support.",

It's been a year because we live on the east coast, otherwise we'd be regulars! I ate a beautiful, enormous and fresh spinach salad topped with bacon and hard-boiled egg. Husband had a homemade cherry turnover, spinach, bacon, and Swiss omelet. Son ate the ham, provolone and olive omelet. Omelets were huge, cooked to perfection and came with 4 thick-slices of toast.

Its nestled in between industrial buildings and doesn't look like much from the outside but I was complete blown away by the customer service and food.   Peter and Peggy both greeted me and talked me through the menu. I ended up getting the half tuna melt and onion soup. I don't say this often but it was the best lunch I have had in a very long time, you could taste the love it was made with, I can't wait to try the breakfast! Also! Don't forget to grab a cookie...they are a MUST!!!",

If you know the area its literally across the street from a Safeway distribution center, tucked into a business area. Best bet is to use the GPA function on the \"Yelp app\" (shameless plug). The owner was a pleasant gentleman that explained how the produce and meats are fresh and the bread is from a local bakery in the same area. Always good to know that fresh ingredients are applied to the plentiful food! I ordered myself a corn beef sandwich. Seems like when I try out a mom & pops place I have to compare corn beef anything with NY quality! Let me tell you this has to be the best and I mean best corn beef sandwich I have had in the valley!  The toasted bread was so fluffy and fresh that you can tell by the texture and flavors of the bread that it was not process nonsense. I was very pleased and so were my work buddies with the meals they chose. We will be coming back from breakfast very soon!",

    "text": "One of the things Boyfriend and I try to do when we're on vacation is to find local restaurants to try out. I mean, what's the point of hitting up a chain restaurant we could easily find in our own town when there are usually awesome places to explore and local economies to support? We usually start by using Yelp to find places nearby that have good ratings, and this one came up first on the list.  We had some trouble finding the restaurant, which was really more down to Boyfriend's mistyping of the address into his GPS than the location of the building. It is in a bit of a strange place for a cafe, tucked in a fairly industrial neighborhood with very little other commercial property around, but I'm sure they make good money from the officefolk coming in for lunch breaks. Not a bad strategy, really.  All the non-vegetarians (meaning the three people there who weren't me) ordered Monte Cristos. If a restaurant serves one of those, you can pretty much bank on Boyfriend trying it at least once. I ordered an egg sandwich, myself, and when the owner heard I was a vegetarian he offered to add some extra vegetables to the sandwich so it wouldn't be boring.  The Montes were a big hit with everyone else, and based on the other reviews here, I'd say ordering one is a pretty safe bet. My egg sandwich was also delicious, and more than filling enough for breakfast. We liked the place so much that we came back two days later.  Two more Monte Cristos made their way into the bellies of my cohorts, including Boyfriend again. My sister's husband got a breakfast burrito, and I opted for a plate of French toast. When they say the French toast is big, they MEAN it. Three huge slices of Texas toast, dipped in batter and fried to golden perfection. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Again, everyone was pleased with their meals.  I was the only person who had coffee while we were there, and while I don't necessarily agree with the people who rave about it being the best in town, it was definitely not bad. I ordered it both days, which I wouldn't have done if I'd hated it.  As for the atmosphere, it's definitely a little more Team Jesus than I'd like. I'm not a huge fan of people using their businesses to promote their spiritual beliefs, no matter what religious text they choose to read, so being surrounded by Bible verses and crosses was a little bit uncomfortable for me. However, the good food balanced that out, and the owners were both super friendly and talkative, engaging us in conversation the first day and welcoming us warmly the second day. For good, veg-friendly food and nice people, I could probably put up with just about any decor.",

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, and since I can't actually give a half-star rating I give them 4 stars. Besides it is a mom/pop place and they are better than some national/international chain (rarely will ever give a chain better than 3 stars); I can't lump them into same category as the chains.

    "text": "I came here for breakfast after reading good things and ended up driving to the other side of Tempe to try it out one morning before class.  I ordered the Monte Cristo with a side of bacon.  The food is probably closer to 3.5-4 stars.  The Monte Cristo was actually really, really good - probably one of the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly sweet and just a bit savory and very fresh.  The bacon was good too, though just a hair under how I like mine cooked.  They brag about having some of the best coffee in town.  Nope.  It's crap.  I mean, we're not talking about drive-thru coffee, but it's at best standard diner coffee.  Two stars on the Joe.  Prices were average.  The ambiance, at least for me, is a one star.  Maybe 1.5 if I'm feeling generous.  I can't decide if it felt like I was eating at an old lady's house or a church waiting room.  The place is Jesused-out.  I'm not religious, but I don't really mind religion either - I just don't like sitting down to Coffee with Christ.  The whole meal felt like it was served in the green room for the 700 Club.  I guess that shouldn't have surprised me since the restaurant's website links to RBC Ministries.  The whole thing was just way too overbearing to be cozy at all.  Even my super-religious friends would probably wonder where the restaurant was.  Between that and the constant interruptions from the staff, my working breakfast was thoroughly thwarted.  Basically, really good food, meh-to-blah coffee, and a very uncomfortable dining room.",

We were walked through the menu, given suggestions, it was nice. The staff is a wonderful pleasure. I feel its pretty rare to get such personal and friendly service. We ordered 2 wraps and a couple cookies. Everything was really good and fresh. We had the chorizo and green chiles and turkey with cranberry salsa wraps. I'd recommend either. Overall, this place is a cute family restaurant. It has a homey feel to it and it was very pleasant. Plus, they show their love for Jesus! I'm down for a place like that.",

The only problem I had was that it seemed insincere because everything seemed pre packaged or made and then wrapped up and put on a shelf to sell. At the time we were looking for a mom and pop shop with homemade cinnamon rolls and a good two eggs, bacon, toast breakfast. We got kind of a cheap version of that.",

    "text": "Morning Star Cafe...I Love This Place.  This is your typical, but not so typical Mom 'N' Pop Deli.  The food is always fresh and creative and the specials are top notch.  I have never had a bad experience or meal at Morning Star.  Each day they serve a different special and I suggest you try all of them.  My personal favorite is the Turkey Relleno Grilled Sandwich which is served on Tuesdays.  They do more than lunch too.  Their breakfast's are also very good (check out the pictures).  This is a small place located in an industrial area; so, don't be surprised by its location.  You can eat inside or out side at one of a few select tables.  This is a fun place to find and the food is well worth the adventure!  Do yourselves a favor and check them out...Support The Small Local Guys!",

I asked how many eggs in the omelette, and was merely told \"it's big\". \"So I don't need to add an egg?\" \"Nope.\" Many places wouldn't say something that might discourage someone to spend more money, but he was right; it was plenty big, and very tasty. The coffee was likewise very good, and the sourdough toast was absolutely fantastic. Nothing but butter on it, and if I wasn't already plenty full, I might have gotten two more orders. I will be back, and have already encouraged my son, who lives nearby, to give it a try. He's a college athlete, so if the pancakes are anywhere as good (and large) as the omelette, he is likely to become a regular.",

I had a veggie omelette and asked for tomatoes and cheddar cheese added to it. Got to choose a side of white, wheat, or sourdough toast (usually not a big toast fan ill have maybe 1-2 slices) but this, I had 3 of 4 since the bread was just TOO good! The omelette tasted completely homemade- none of that fake eggs subway uses. The Cheese steak sandwich is also one to try! Friendly service, great big portions, fresh bread, and not bad prices, definitely need to go again!",

    "text": "I was in town for work and craved a traditional breakfast. I came across Morning Star Cafe on yelp and decided to give it a try since it was near my hotel.   They have various traditional breakfast options. I decided on French Toast and a large coffee. I placed the order on the phone and arrived within 15 minutes with the food being ready.   The cafe itself is extremely homey and reminds of an old school diner. It was cozy and a perfect place to have breakfast by yourself or with friends. I wish I had more time to enjoy the cafe.   The owners greeted me with a friendly smile and \"good morning\".    When I placed my coffee order I had asked for cream and sugar on the side and unfortunately that wasn't an option as they prepare the cream and sugar for you based on your specifications. I was hesitant on how the coffee would taste. Before paying the owner asked me to try the coffee to see how I liked it, and to my astonishment it was one of the best coffees I've ever had! The coffee itself was delicious and was perfect with the amount of sugar and cream they put in. I didn't need to make any adjustments. They let me know that they have a local person they go to for their beans and they know exactly where the beans come from and when they are roasted. Not many places can say that.   After paying for my food and leaving with my completely satisfied coffee I knew I would be coming back. I eventually had the French toast at work and loved it! It was the perfect breakfast.  With great service and even friendlier owners, I will definitely be coming back!",

The owners were also very welcoming and super nice!! They taught us a lot about the area and recommend fun things to do! If I lived here, this would be my go to spot for breakfast.

Fresh sandwiches, soup, and baked goods are what you can expect to find at the small cafe. The owners are very kind and personable.  They clearly care about their cafe, their customers, and community. After ordering I noticed a small hand written sign at the counter indicating that anyone who will be spending Thanksgiving alone is welcome to come and join them for dinner at the cafe which they will provide at no charge (donations accepted but not required)- that shows care and commitment to the community.  My first visit was great and I will be back.",

I became based out of Phoenix for a Seattle based company back in 2006.  My new coworker introduced me to this cafe when I first started and their egg sandwich with green chiles.  Wonderful Mom and Pop cafe with wholesome couple owners.  Food is heart-felt, the digs small but comfortable, clean and homey.  Dave loves the stuffed tomato, too.    The office moved not long after I moved here from Tempe to Chandler which virtually eliminated our visits but I've never forgotten them.  A short several years later, I got moved back to Seattle.  I felt I owed them this review which is an uncommon five stars.  Such a wonderful time of my life that is permanently associated with Morning Star.  Thank you so much.",

The cafe was quaint with several pieces of \"homey\" decor and a Christian theme.  The owners were very friendly and easily engaged in conversation.  We ordered eggs, sausage, the Denver omelet, toast, and pancakes.  The quality of the pancakes over shadowed all the other food.  Melt in your mouth deliciousness!

    "text": "Full disclosure, I came here mainly for the name in a tongue-in-cheek joke with myself. To me, Morning Star is an anonym of Lucifer (from the King James Bible) so, while I wasn't completely surprised it was highly Christian-themed inside with painted Bible quotes on the walls and \"family\" decorations, I wasn't sure why they'd choose to name their cafe that. I'm not Christian myself, so it must have a completely different connotation in other versions of The Book that I'm not aware of without consulting Wikipedia. It was also in a very industrial area, tucked into the outside corner of a warehouse building - easy to miss driving past, between all the semi trucks, even when you're looking for it. They probably get a lot of work and trucker traffic - but with the decor theme and location, it was all a bit confusing. The important bit, the food, was delicious. Very cheap and came out quick. My bacon and cheddar breakfast burrito and coffee were both better quality than I expected. My dad also enjoyed his chorizo and green chile burrito. The two people behind the counter, who I would assume were the owners in this mom-and-pop type place, were very personable and attentive. Overall, a nice breakfast, but I think I'll leave this one to the regulars. There are less  garishly decorated breakfast joints in the area to cater to us heathens.",

When you walk in the the first thing you are struck by is how unlike the inside is the to the outside.  From the outside Morning Star looks like any old breakfast/lunch shack jammed into an industrial park mainly to cater to the employees of the various surrounding businesses, but the inside actually reminds me of an old time breakfast joint replete with funny old time signs strewn about declaring how wonderful their fresh brewed coffee is.  I ordered the Italian omelet with an iced tea.  The first thing to point out is that Morning Star does not accept credit or debit cards.  They do, however, have an ATM conveniently located next to the register.  Luckily I had cash so this wasn't an issue, but I can imagine that first timers who hold up the line during the lunch rush could be on the wrong end of some dirty looks.  The omelet was fantastic, it was absolutely bursting with with tomatoes, marinara sauce, cheese, and Italian spices.  The wheat toast was thick sliced and the bread was made that morning, though not on site.  The owners, a married couple, were extremely pleasant to chat with and while I write this I regret not learning their names.  Overall I have to say that I'm sold on this place.  If I wasn't moving out of state in the next few weeks this would definitely be my short-drive breakfast place of choice.",

The food is a little pricey, however, it is well worth the price.  A typical sandwich is about 3 inches thick.  There is nothing that I have eaten there that I did not like.  The deserts are all made on site and they are to die for, True comfort food.  They also do breakfast all day.  My favorite ... their coffee.  Peter, the owner, I believe gets it from Mexico.  It has a caramelized roast so it is strong but never bitter.

I've never had a bad meal here, most of the time I call ahead and pick it up to go in the mornings and they are really good at handling those, always give you an accurate time, rarely more than ten minutes. The food - the breakfast highlight is the Monte cristo, but try it for lunch too! It's amazing with egg dipped bread, crispy on the outside and melted ham and cheese on the inside with generous slices of thick cut bacon. Comes with homemade jam to really make it just out of this world. Sweet and salty mmmmmmmm. The Rueben will be one of the best you've had in Arizona. And although it seems crazy, they have a tuna melt that makes me think about it randomly. It's just a simple tuna melt but the way they make the tuna is perfect every time, fresh and consistent. This couple does such a great job, and they do everything the right way. They don't mind letting you get creative and making your own things up either! Thanks for being so great to us these last years.",

It was delicious--one of the best omelets I've had anywhere! It came out fast and piping hot. You can taste the effort and care put into the marinara sauce-- a hint of sweetness and straightforward garlic but not overpowering. Generous amount of zucchini cooked to the perfect tenderness along with fresh tomato. Just the right amount of cheese.   The sourdough toast is also worth noting. A generous portion of two, thick-cut slices with tasty strawberry jam.   The prices are affordable. The atmosphere is clean and bright and the staff are very friendly.",

Located in a small business park in a larger industrial area the cafe is unassuming from the outside but upon entering the decor is reminiscent of a Midwestern bakery; quotes are painted on the walls and a hearty bookshelf is chock full of interesting reads.    The staff was friendly and efficient with the order at the counter.  I ordered the chorizo and chiles wrap with a side of sourdough toast.   Order was quickly turned around and it was great to see a Square terminal for the transaction.    Food was hearty and piping hot.  A thin flour burrito wrapped the filling which was nice because it was a ton of food.  Homemade salsa was flavorful but not spicy (would have liked more spice but still good).  Toast was buttered with a surgical precision, thick cut slices were overflowing on the plate.    Proprietors were talkative and cheerful as they made their rounds.  Definitely a locals only type of place but happy to feel like I was included in on the secret.   definitely recommend.",

    "text": "This place is a diamond in the rough. Literally, a small mom and pop restaurant in an industrial park/business center. It wasn't hard to find and there's plenty of parking. Usually there's no parking in a business center. It has a very cozy and homey feel. There's portraits on the wall as well as decorations, books, board games, and etc. that you can enjoy. They also sell homemade cards and scrapbooks as well as homemade granola bars? The owner showed me a scrapbook that his wife made with his children's picture and memories inside. It was very nice and sweet! You should definitely check it out if you're looking to buy a scrapbook. (:  The owner is very friendly and sweet. I ordered a roast beef and a corn beef sandwich with everything (pickles, bell peppers, onions, and alfalfa sprouts). You can decide your choice of bread, whether you want it toasted, and your choice of cheese. The sandwiches are huge! I was expecting to get a small sandwich like the ones you get at Panera. It was flavorful and delicious and I was full after eating half of it.   I asked for a box to put the sandwiches in and the owner wrapped them up nicely individually and put it in a bag with \"thank you\" stamped on the outside. Seeing this small gesture really made my day because it really shows that they care about their customers. It's the little things that counts. I just thought it was really sweet.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone. If you're on the go, you can call in to order so that you can avoid the wait. One thing that I would like to see them improve in the future is that they will be able to make their own meats, that would be totally awesome and I can see this business really sky rocket.  Try it out! It's as good as they all say it is (:",

The quality, freshness, and flavor of the ingredients makes this restaurant get it's 5 star rating!  The homemade cheese danishes are the best ones we've ever had!    We each had a variation on eggs and bacon for our breakfast.  My husband had a 2 egg breakfast, I had an egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwich, and my sister-in-law had an egg and cheese wrap.  The eggs were cooked perfectly in all 3 variations.  The sourdough bread was delicous.  The roll on the breakfast sandwich ......  YUM.  My sister-in-law was raving about the salsa that came with her breakfast wrap.    We are very excited to go back and try their lunch menu now.  (although I'm going to be craving those cheese danishes for a while!!).  Mouthwatering!!!  The last two things worth mentioning are the exceptional service and warm atmosphere.  The husband and wife owners both talked to us and made us feel so welcome.  We're new to the area and they gave us some great information.  It was like we were talking to friends we'd known for a while!  It really made the meal special.  Thank you, Morning Star Cafe for doing what you do, the way you do it!!   See you for lunch VERY soon!",

We took our 11U baseball team which totaled to a 24 people (parents, players and siblings).  They were so welcoming and handled us perfectly.....One person (the owner) was serving all our food and refilling our coffee and he did an outstanding job. The also make latte's and cappuccino's and my husband has the best nutmeg cinnamon vanilla latte. The food was amazing. The BREAD is baked fresh and is delivered to the cafe every morning from a local bakery.  You can really tell that everything is made fresh. I had the spinach, bacon and swiss omelette and it was so flavorful, not greasy and DELICISOUS.  Their pancakes and omelette portions are big enough to share. The owner's were a very sweet couple and they and their staff were incredible.  Thank You so much from the T2 Orioles 11U Baseball Team, Corona CA",

The owner suggested a white tea with my breakfast sandwich and I was sold.   The wait was not long at all and the food was served within a few minutes.

    "text": "We were on our last day of our vacation and looking for a last meal before heading to the airport. I checked yelp for restaurants that were currently open nearby and thankfully discovered the Morning Star Cafe. It is in a mostly industrial location that you would never just \"stumble upon\".  We walked in to a very cute cafe and were immediately greeted by the owner, offered coffee and given a menu. It was about 10 am, but neither one of us really wanted breakfast and asked if we could get one of the sandwiches offered. No problem at all, order anything you want! So, I ordered a turkey on rye, my husband got a muffaletta.   While we were waiting, the owner chatted us up a bit, asked a few questions, discovered that we were from out of town. She told us about her favorite places in AZ and even brought over some of her favorite magazines outlining things to do in the area (we are already planning our next trip back!). Very friendly! I can't even comprehend the complaints about the service being nil. There were a couple of other tables and each was treated with the same warm service that we were.  Our food came, and it was delicious. It is kind of hard to make something fantastic out of the common turkey sandwich, but they pull it off. The bread is about an inch thick, perfectly fresh and soft (delivered nightly by a company just a couple buildings down as told to us by the owner), lots of fresh veggies are offered with the turkey (to order, of course). My husband's muffaletta was perfect. Just the right about of olive salad. The coffee was fantastic too (as others have mentioned). As we were paying our bill (which was very reasonable), the owner gave us a little bag with a couple of their fresh muffins to enjoy on the plane since she knew we were headed out! One blueberry and one cinnamon, they were a perfect mid-flight snack.   So, I would hands down recommend Morning Star Cafe. This is the sort of place that I would visit on the regular if I lived locally. I am sure that I would be greeted by name and be handed a warm cup of coffee as I came in the door, it is that type of place. I love the fact that it is family owned, they have a guest book which starts with an entry detailing that this cafe has been a long time dream of theirs and describing all of the work putting the place together.  The cute decor was done by their friends and family, rewarded by home cooked meals . There is an obvious pride and love for their work that is often missing from your typical corporate chain that is so common in the Phoenix area (and any other city for that matter). If you are in the area, plug the address into your GPS and stop by, you won't regret it!",

The coffee was very good, freshly roasted from a place down the street. The coffee is a light breakfast blend, so don't criticize it if you are expecting burnt Starbucks (like some reviews). All the bread is also made nearby. Everything tasted very fresh and was prepared very well. The restaurant had a very homey feel to it. The owners took the orders, prepared the food, interacted with us and even gave us some ideas on what to do during our vacation. I highly recommend this place.",

It's clean, bright, but they need to turn the ac on cuz it was warm! They offer simple breakfast & lunch options and have a decent selection. I came in here for brunch after a job interview and ordered the veggie omelete. You order at the counter and wait for ur food. It came with two slices of toasted bread, each cut in half. A gal brought my order and asked what kind of jelly I wanted. Love grape jelly! The eggs were yummy and so was the toast w/ jelly. I wish they had apple juice. My only other complaint besides the temp is that they don't offer milk alternatives like almond or coconut milk. I think it's become a standard for most business and you'll lose a lot of business if you don't keep up. For example, I stopped going to Starbucks because they didn't offer an alternative other than soy (can't drink soy either). Starbuck's has recently begun to expand their milk options. You see, I'm lactose intolerant so cow's milk is a no for me. I would have liked to purchse an iced coffee w/ milk. Overall, I'd eat here again if I'm in the area.",
