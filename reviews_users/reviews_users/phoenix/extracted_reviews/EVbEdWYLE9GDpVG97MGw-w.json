It took almost 10 mins just to get menus and someone to take out drink order.  I am going to make this quick and to the point -- I don't plan on returning to this hot mess. The service is incredibly incrediblyyyyyyyyyy slow and sloppy. The food sucks -- delivered cold. I would have complained but after delivering the food we didn't see the waiter for like 30 + mins.   To sum it up -- our waiter was also the bartender. Bad move on the part of the restaurant.  Food and services were terrible -- will not return.  Oh AND a couple at our large table left early. So when we went to pay our bill they told us that that couple never paid and asked if we were going to take care of it.  We called our friends to ask what happened -- they texted us a photo of the paid receipt!!!!!!!!! This restaurant is extremely poorly managed --- double charge??? Keep it classy Macayo's !!!",

Waiter did a nice up-sell on the Cuervo margarita, which I got. He did fail to ask if I liked them blended or on the rocks tho. My wife ordered a regular margarita and our guest got a soft drink.   For entrees, I ordered the BBQ Chipotle Tacos, my wife got the Roasted Tomatillo Spinach Fish Tacos and our guest ordered the California Burro.   My entree was well prepared, with plenty of chipotle sauce and filling. My wife's tacos were equally impressive. Our guest had a fairly neutral reaction to his rather plain looking burro. I think he was expecting more sauce, since it was pretty dry.   Service was cheerful and adequate for a slow night.   I recommend Macayo's for those who are uninitiated in Mexican food. They actually serve Tex-Mex but it is a good step into the Mexican cuisine for Easterners like our guest.",

There's a large patio, but for me it wasn't a big lure because it was hot outside. It was only 90, so maybe when it gets to 100 they have misters? Who knows :)  My sister had a margarita & from where I sat, across the table, it was burning my nose, lol!  For an appetizer we had the guacamole. It could have used a squeeze of lime, but other than that it was good! Fresh.  For my main dish I opted for the blackened mahi tacos, which had a 2 chili rating, the highest on the menu. I was expecting hot, but it was barely mild. The ahi itself was good. On the menu it said it came with pineapple pico de gallo & tomatillo salsa. I got neither. I asked for the pineapple pico de gallo. It was so disappointing! Bland & not fresh. I don't think these 2 corn tortilla tacos were worth $15. I chose not to have the beans and rice the tacos come with, but if you want to get full you'd probably need to keep those :)   My sister got the California burrito and she loved it. Maybe I'll give that a try next time!",

The food is what you expect for classical Mexican food and better than average which is why this review has 3 stars.  If they made the ingredients better here this would be my go to for good priced Mexican food more often.  The margaritas are priced good, as are all other drinks, which makes this place a great spot for drinking a lot then having some Mexican food.    The reason this is a 3 star and not 2 is because I am a huge Mexican foodie.  I deducted 2 stars because the food could have some better ingredients and it is a chain restaurant.  Both are negatives in my book.",

Late in the afternoon on Saturday, we went to the Tempe location for the first time, and were very disappointed.  The food was as good as usual, but we had two issues.  First, I ordered a standard Margarita.  I hadn't eaten since morning, so had an empty stomach, and I could tell that there was no alcohol in that drink.  NONE.  Eight dollars is pretty expensive for a glass of Margarita mix.  Second, when our server brought the bill, there were two mistakes in the restaurant's favor totaling two dollars and 29 cents.  All together, about $10 overcharged!",

The weather was beautiful last night, so thought we would ride the light rail to Tempe and enjoy some drinks and food on a patio.  I've always been intrigued by the Depot Cantina, so that is where we decided to go.  We found a nice table on the patio and we were off to a good start.  But, it all went downhill from there....the service was so terribly slow and she didn't really apologize for it.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in...only because I asked another server to help us.  They cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out.  We told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal...took 30 minutes for that to be fixed.  The food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive.  The soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend's burro...seriously no attention to detail in this place.  I can't imagine a manager was on duty last night because I can't imagine they would let the restaurant run this way.  I hope they get their act together because this place is in a great location with a large patio.",

Our server was nice but not very informed or attentive.    I was extremely disappointed in the food. The salsa tasted like someone accidentally dumped a bag of salt in it and my  veggie fajitas only had broccoli, carrots and zucchini. It wouldn't have been so bad if there were sauteed onions and bell peppers to go with but nothing about it said \"Mexican food.\"  Food aside, I have to say that the entertainment was really good. It was one guy and a guitar who sang Boys In The Hood by Easy E and Lovesong by Cure (or Adele depending on how old you are).  I am sure that I will be back at least for drinks but I hope that they work on improving the evening service, Depot Cantina is a staple in Tempe and I would hate to see it go any further downhill.",

    "text": "This was the most embarrassing, disgusting night I've had at a restaurant.  First off all, the waiter was too busy making fun of my drink order (smaller size) to get it right, even after coming back to double check what I'd ordered.  The food itself was barely decent enough to eat since we were there and had paid for it, but I (and everyone else in my party) declined take home boxes for the leftovers.  Worst of all, we got about halfway through our chips before we discovered a USED sugar packet in the bottom of the bowl.  Apparently, they took a bowl from a previous table, refilled it, and passed it on to us without emptying it or cleaning it.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, we got nothing by a fresh bowl of chips and a surprised look.  NO apology, no words at all, from the waiter.  This was back in March (2008), and I reported it to the business the next day.  They, too, offered no apology.  In fact, the only apology I ever received for this potential health violation was from the friend who recommended that I go to this place.  Avoid it like the plague.  There are better places for Mexican food, no matter how Americanized you like it.  Update:  I mentioned my horror story to an acquaintance who had just gone to Macayo's.  He found it interesting, since he noticed the waiters now mash the chips as they pick them up from a table.  We wonder if they do this to make it clear which bowls have used chips, and which are fresh.  He said the food was still \"meh.\"  Over a year later, and I still never received an apology.  You'd think they'd take a health violation more seriously than that.",

    "text": "I finally ate lunch here after not being able to get decent parking for Quiznos on Mill Ave.  My coworker and I were starving and needed a place to shoot the shit so we decided to give it a try.  I really did enjoy the patio area.  The weather was amazing and I had cabin fever from being stuck in my office all morning attending boring meetings.  They do hand out the free chips and salsa (glad it was free b/c they weren't tasty enough to actually pay for).  I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a good portion and I didn't get sick so I was happy.  The wait staff seemed so busy yet there weren't that many people in the restaurant but we are talking about a college crew so I can forgive them for their lack of detail and attention.   Macayos isn't my favorite \"Cantina\" but I'm sure it will hit the spot on another beautiful day when I need to unwind in the warm sun.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on the open patio, good parking and the fact I didn't have to ride the porcelain bus later that day.",

As I started, call me nuts... Its Tempe.. I dont usually ... I just say, no. Neat patio...but too hot... we opted to get our drink on inside.. the place was hopping even at 2pm.. amongst the 6 or so of us... we had a few margaritas..a few apps, a few taco and enchilada plates... I stuck with a cheese crisp and margarita...lite on the salt, please. Strong..well, strong enough for me. Truly, I liked everything... Its a chain and I was surprised.. The waiter, could have been more attentive and a bit nicer, as the hostesses. And some of our party complained that the food came out a bit on the lukewarm side...Im going with the fact that our party wasnt small... and its Tempe..",

    "text": "3 stars because in my past I have always loved this restaurant, I will give them the benefit of the doubt that since we went on Cinco de Mayo it was a little bit overwhelming for them. Normally I love all the food & the service is fine. Unfortunately last night with it being so busy a lot of things were overlooked for our table. I ordered a strawberry margarita, when it came out I didn't realize they hadn't bothered to mix in the fake strawberry syrup, so the entire bottom was just an awful mouthful of strawberry flavored syrup- made me feel sick I didn't want to finish the drink, so I wouldn't suggest paying extra for \"flavor\" when it was that terrible. We didn't have any place settings, napkins or plates on our table so I had to ask for them after we had been served chips & salsa & still only half were brought to us, took about 10 min just to get napkins. I also had to ask for water & she never brought my friend any water. Then when we got our bill, my friend who had just ordered 2 chicken tacos realized her bill was too expensive for that & when we asked the waitress claimed she charged the taco meal (which should have come with two sides) so even though she was charged for the two sides, the server did not include them. So we asked for them to go since she had already paid for them. Again normally I love this place, but not sure I'd go back on a holiday night. Not really worth a gross drink & bad service. Definitely would suggest it for a regular less busy night, love the food!",

My beef taco tasted of burned meat and cheese enchilada had zero flavor. Also my rice had a strong red sauce flavor that was overpowering.  The entry way floor was dirty, otherwise seemed clean.

When entering the building, we always seem to wait for a period of time before someone greets us and finds us a table. Which overall is fine, I don't mind waiting a bit.   2. Our last visit our server seemed irritated by our table, which was sad because it was my parents first time there. I understand though.

My son had shrimp tacos and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I had the fiesta salad with angus steak.  The steak was a little dry, but I dipped it in the Baja sauce which was incredible.  The only factor that was a negative was an unpleasant smell that came through regularly as the wind blew.  Not sure if the garbage was full from a busy weekend (we went on Sunday) or if something nearby was impacting the experience.",

We waited there for about 6 or 7 minutes before someome acknowledged us. While we were waiting at least 6 employees walked by and not a single one asked if we had been helped, or offered to seat us. When someone finally came they told us it would be a 20 minute wait for inside the restaurant and a 10 minute wait for the patio. I looked on the patio and there were at least 10 tables open.   Once we were seated we quickly ordered our food. My husband wasn't with us but asked if i would order him food to go. He told me what he wanted which I then looked over at the menu to find. I couldn't find it anywhere on the menu so i asked the server. The waitress then told me what my husband wanted was on the lunch menu which we originally didn't get!  I couldnt believe that a lunch menu is offered daily from 12-3 and they didn't give us one!  The food was good but the service wasn't.  I would have ordered something from the lunch menu had it been provided in time. Instead, I ordered something comparatively more expensive. I will not go back to this location.",

    "text": "Great concept and whimsical decor here at Macayo's, however their quality of food and service makes this place look like the forgotten step sister of chain restaurants like Chili's, Rubio's or Rainforest Cafe.  The place looked completely empty, except for two tables of people and some individuals at the bar. We were served some chips and salsa as well as our waters, which is pretty standard. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler which came with a Verde Chicken, Cheese and Beef Enchiladas, Spanish Rice, Black Beans with Guac, Cabbage and Sour Cream on the side.  My party and I pretty much filled up with chips and salsa before the food came out, it was about more than 25 minutes before all the food came out. As another server brought out my plate, he mentioned something along the lines of \"Do you think you can finish that?\". The sampler is indeed large enough for two people to eat and looked unappealing and messy. The enchiladas were good, but not the best I've ever had. The rice tasted old, with hard pieces and was dry. The beans, gritty and you could see how much bean liquid had evaporated on the side of the plate (possibly from sitting under the hot lamp too long). I managed to eat one of the enchiladas before giving in and just boxing it for to-go.  Service was lacking, don't come here if you're in a hurry! Waiters hardly out front, food is mediocre to say the least and not worth the price you pay. The rest of my party didn't enjoy their Fish Tacos, since the grilled fish was incredibly chewy and over-cooked, they didn't finish their plates.",

    "text": "I CANNOT believe I haven't reviewed this place! I wasn't going to review this place for my experience last night (which was pretty par) because I assumed I had reviewed before, but apparently not. Anyway, Macayo's as a whole is somewhat a blight on society. I know that is a little strong, but it really is not good and not authentic and just not a place where people should eat ever if they have the option. I have been to this location several times (always against my will....I have a friend that really likes it...not sure how that is possible and went to grad school at ASU, so hard to avoid). Anyway, the few times I have had dishes with meat in them from this restaurant are by far the worst times. Their meat is horrible. It has a disgusting texture and is completely devoid of flavor. So meat is definitely out when eating here (that is probably safer for your health anyway....I am just imagining a Kitchen Nightmares type scenario behind the scenes at this place). The food that does not contain meat is significantly less disgusting, albeit pretty bland. Their one saving grace is their baja sauce (sweet cream cheesy sauce) which is obviously tasty, but so terrible for you it is hard to eat in good conscious (but sometimes.....let's just say it happens). So last night I got a cheese crisp, which is pretty unmessupable and it was fine, although it had several random food items on it that obviously fell onto it from other plates (some lettuce, a small piece of chicken, etc)....nice touch. I had their 'special' Marg which was actually pretty good (it was Grand Marnier and tequila), but when I got the bill it was still 9$, so it did not appear to actually be on special (or it is an incredibly overpriced drink to begin with). That brings me to another complaint....this place is WAY overpriced. Like, an entree costs 12$ at least and is lower quality than Filiberto's. The entrees are also way WAY too big....they should probably offer half or quarter size portions for less (although the food isn't good anyway, so it doesn't really matter). So why 2 stars and not 1? This place is a decent place to drink if you are into premixed type alcohol, but they have a good happy hour and the baja sauce is good, so I can't justify a 1 star BUT if I had it my way, I would never eat at a Macayo's again ever.",

The lunch specials are reasonable they have items from $6.99, 7.99, 8.99 and up. With the free chips and salsa i find that a $6.99 item and a water is just enough. Their menu had advertised $2.00 bottle beer which was a nice treat for lunch. I've tried their nachos and Bravo burro which both were decent, nothing special some of the $6.99 items don't come w rice and beans so pay attn. The service is good if your in a hurry for lunch it wont be a issue to get in and out plus the place is located a block off Mill ave and close to a light rail stop.",

Only thing is that happy hour is very limited in the time window so make sure you get off work early or maybe head somewhere else.

We were looking for a fun/casual/not JUST a bar but had a bar kind of place for our 20 year reunion.  The Caboose Party Area was PERFECT!  It has  a private entrance and enough space for a DJ, dancing, photo booth, tables, mingling and space to break off into more intimate groups - either outside or just inside the indoor bar area.  The food provided was yummy and the drinks were priced right & good!  The service we received was stellar - from the beginning to the end.  I had several people come up to me telling me what a GREAT place this was and how much more fun this was than their reunion or that they were going to suggest this as a location for an upcoming reunion.  We also used The Courtyard by Marriot Downtown Tempe as our hotel base - so people could do the drunk walk home.  ;)  My only wish was that Macayo's stayed open after midnight.  The party had to roll over to Mill. :)  Oh!  On a side note - Their blackened Ahi Tacos are KILLER!",

Overly greasy chips and the salsa was more of a from-the-jar and not homemade. Our food was good. Huge portions so we had plenty to take home. It took a long time to get drink refills...but I think our server was new as he seemed way overwhelmed. I'd return if I were in the area again.",

    "text": "After going to macayos a few times my friend and I decided to get the margarita glasses (11$ I think they were) that you can take home.   For that price you get the margarita glass as well as a margarita inside of it. Then after that, every time you bring the glass back they will refill it with margarita for only 3.99! And it's a huge glass. Pretty good deal I think.   Also, the staff always offers to wash the margarita glass so you can bring it home again after you are done drinking. I think that's awesome.   The only thing I don't like is that sometimes it takes awhile for the server to come over. I've had several times where I had to go get a server for our table bc we had waited for quite awhile.   Other than that, friendly staff, good food and good deals",

This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.",

I definitely like the location, and it's very big. There isn't a whole lot of parking, but it is close to the light rail. They also have a big outdoor patio which seems great for happy hours or birthday parties or anything where you have a big group. I didn't notice if they have misters, but there is a bar outside and I believe they have games outside, too. The service we had was good. Our food came out fast, our order was correct, and it was pleasant, except for the person at the next table celebrating her 28th birthday with a loud song from the staff. Never understood that bizarre ritual myself, but it seemed like she was enjoying herself, too, so good on Macayo's!",

    "text": "I must say that I am quite surprised by the lack of superior ratings given to Macayo's on this site.  I live literally right next to Macayo's and had never been there in my three years as a Tempe resident. When I heard through a friend that Macayo's was more than some college bar that is known for more than bar foods, I had to give it a shot.  The service was VERY friendly and efficient. Both my girlfriend's meal and mine was delivered in a very timely fashion. Not only that, but I was more than happy with the quality of the meal. The only reason I didn't feel that I could give this a full 5/5 was because the portion's weren't up to my standards. If I pay $12.95 for a burrito, I fully expect that I will be full. Given that the burrito I ordered was fit with two sides and extra meat, I was surprised when a Lean Pocket-sized entree came before me. However, it was delicious and I can't really complain too much.  I particularly liked the decor in the restaurant. Although the main part is quite difficult to access due to the gargantuan bar in the front, it's a very comfortable, friendly environment.  I'm definitely coming here again soon.",

    "text": "My wife and I really like the Macayo's on Central, and go there about once a month.  I haven't been to Depot Cantina in several years. Woody Macayo should make them take his name off the sign.  We went on a Saturday evening, after a concert at Gammage. The patio was dark and vacant, and we wandered in to the host stand. There was nobody there. We thought they were closed and were turning to leave when a server came up and showed us to a table in the bar.   Chips, salsa, and water arrived, and I asked for the \"hot\" sauce, the stuff without all the cilantro in it--the good stuff. Tick tock tick tock. We finished the other stuff waiting for the hot sauce, which finally arrived. Both sauces were awful. Super watery, it just dripped off the chip. Definitely not the same stuff they serve on Central. He took my margarita order and the food order. We asked for more of the watery, chunky salsa for her. It never did come.  When it came, my margarita tasted weird, like they had used an incorrect ingredient in making it. Based on the previous inattentiveness of our waitron, I decided not to wait another 10 minutes to send it back.  I ordered two enchiladas, and all rice, no beans. My wife ordered the chile relleno, all beans, no rice. The enchiladas were okay, but the rice was dismal. When was it cooked, on Thursday? I usually eat about half in the restaurant, and eat the rest at home later. I ate a few forkfuls and left the rest. My wife said her relleno was okay, but she only ate a bit of her beans, too.  The check came. We paid. We left, and vowed never to return.  I give it that second star because I have good memories of coming here many years ago.",

This one is definitely made for the college scene; part restaurant, part club (at least it feels like it).  We showed up around 6PM to meet some friends for dinner. Since it' was too crowded we sat on the inside.  I couldn't get enough of their amazing chips n salsa.. I got nuts over that stuff.  After more people decided to show up, we had to move tables.   We had a great waitress who was cool with us moving.  Unfortunately the new waiter we had seemed like he just started that week.  After ordering about six different drinks, I think one came out correct.  It was busy, so we only asked them to replace a couple.  We're not that mean.    So this week I happened to be on a vegetarian kick and I ordered the California Burrito.  Oohhhhh  it was tasty.  However eating literally a basket of chips, I could only eat about half of it.  So wonderful.  So yes I enjoy the food, just wish the services was better when we got moved. Just seemed a bit slow and getting our drinks wrong and one plate, didn't go over too well.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with my recent visit to this Macayo's. I had not been to a Macayo's in at least three years. I remember it being a much better experience back in those days. First off this restaurant is DIRTY. We were seated inside in one of the upper booths. One of the first things that I noticed was that the tile surrounding the booth was covered in dust. First bad sign. The second thing I noticed was that the stained glass windows beside the booth was covered in sauce splatters, ew. There was also a partial hand print in a white sauce on the side of the tile next to me double ew. Unwrapped my silverware and there was a large chunk of tomato and rice attached to my fork. Don't know how that even happens. Makes me shutter to think what they think is passable in the kitchen if they miss dried food on the utensils.  I should have probably thought twice about eating in an establishment so dirty but against my better judgment I ordered food. The chips and salsa were just okay. The chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery. We ordered an extra side of hot salsa but our waiter continuously forgot to bring it until we had already eaten half of our meal. It was not really worth waiting for, it tasted like taco bell hot sauce. The service was bad. It started off okay but our waiter was more and more forgetful throughout the meal. I had originally ordered a fireball shot but after about fifteen minutes had gone by and no drink, my fiance informed one of the other passing waiters that I still had not received my drink. Our waiter showed up in the mean time and asked what it was I had ordered again. He comes back five minutes later and informs me that they are out of fireball. I proceeded to order an extremely over priced $7.99 margarita (usually $8.99). It was decent.  The food. Mediocre at best. I had a Baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. My fiance had a bean burrito enchilada style. The Baja chicken enchilada was pretty good. The Baja sauce has a great flavor but I don't even want to think about how many calories a white cheese cream sauce has in it, it is a once in a few months indulgence but the other food does not make up for the calorie boat of this sauce. The cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh. The red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy. My fiance's bean burrito was luke warm inside.   We got the bill and I had been charged for the fireball that they were out of. It was removed ten minutes later. Will not be back here. Way too many other great Mexican options in town.",

They come topped with refried beans and cheese, and you can add any meat for .99 or other toppings like sour cream, pico, and guacamole for .49. I added baja sauce and ground beef. Was really delicious even if the ground beef was definitely greasy.   Highlights:  -Best refried beans I've had anywhere. I'm easy to please and really like a bean & cheese burro enchilada style, or deep-fried and smothered with baja sauce.  -Their rice side dish is also some of my favorite that I've tried  -Baja sauce is their version of fundido, and again, it's some of the best I've had. It's basically cream cheese, jalepeno, half&half, and spices.  -Their red enchilada sauce is awesome and I always buy the canned version in stores when I make enchiladas at home -Fresh salsa is fantastic, and comes in a spicy version if you ask  Most recently, ordered the spinach con queso. It is basically baja sauce with chunks of spinach. I remember it being yellow back in the day but seems like it's just cream cheese and spinach now. Still tasty, but of course very rich.   Grew up eating Macayo's, so I'm biased towards their flavors, but they're some of my favorite Mexican food, hands down. This location in Tempe always seems to be a ghost town, and I know they closed the Phoenix location where I used to go growing up. It's a shame!",

    "text": "We had our hotel shuttle driver recommend Culinary Dropout to us, but after being dropped off, we quickly changed our mind about staying (drafty eating area on a cold night, barely able to see the menu in the dim light, etc). I pulled up the GPS on my phone to find out what other restaurants were within walking distance, and I saw Macayo. The reviews on Google maps looked good, so we figured it was worth a shot. The restaurant is made from an old train station, which is pretty cool. I like it when people do a great job of repurposing a building like that, and I like unusual buildings in general. We entered the building through a patio/bar area that looked like a nice place to have lunch on a warm, sunny day. However, this was a cold winter night (40s), so we didn't even contemplate eating out there. We were seated promptly, and our friendly waiter, Antonio, brought silverware and menus. After mulling over the menu for a while, I chose the poblano chicken while my husband selected the carne asada burro. While we waited for our food, we snacked on fresh chips and salsa. Anytime that a restaurant makes their own chips, which they seem to do, I'm impressed. The chips were warm with just the right thickness. The salsa was just okay, as it lacked what I feel are the requirements for good salsa (no garlic or cumin), although points for having cilantro! The salsa had a strange aftertaste that we were trying to figure out, so we asked the waiter about the ingredients. He went into the kitchen to ask, and then listed the ingredients for us. It was the chili powder that didn't belong in the salsa, in our opinion. The food was delivered to our table in a surprisingly speedy fashion. Mixed reviews on the food. I absolutely loved the flavor combinations in my poblano chicken and would definitely order it again. However, my husband's burro was pretty bland, and the beef was unseasoned and burned. He mentioned it to Antonio, and he brought us a free fried ice cream to make up for it, which was very thoughtful. The rice had an odd taste, but if you mixed it into the refried beans, it tasted pretty good that way. All in all, for the good service, food taste, and ambience,  I would give the place 4 stars myself, but with my husband's subpar meal (I tasted his and was in agreement about the taste), I think I would lower the grade to 3 1/2 stars. I really wish Yelp allowed us to leave half stars, because this forces me to lower my review to a 3.",

The drink special are okay, but they don't have the variety that I'm used to....The food is hit and miss, mostly unexciting but edible without feeling the need to complain.  The wait staff is polite and friendly, but you can tell that they know the food is borderline between boring and sucky. My advice?  The patio in the evening is pretty, and you can relax and enjoy a fairly decent margarita without breaking the bank.  I'm not sure it's worth going for happy hour though since  during the day it's kind of boring. All in all, an okay experience that I wouldn't mind repeating, but I might eat before I go.  Maybe.",

So, consider this a happy hour/appetizer review, if you like.  They tried really, really hard to make this place feel festive, but succeeded only in making it look like a junkyard full of angry fruit salad.  If you're unfamiliar with that term, head on over to Urban Dictionary.  Go on.  I'll wait.  Are we all together again?  Good.  Let us proceed.  This place sucks.  Not even the free all-you-can-eat appetizers could keep me in here, and I am one cheap bastard.  The only thing they had going for them was the $2 Dos Equis during happy hour.   The appetizer selection was pretty shakey.  There were these things that I think were supposed to be beef enchiladas, a potato concoction, and chips and salsa.  The incognito enchiladas were... stretchy.. and bland.. and the potato thing was about the same, sans the stretchiness.  And how do you fuck up chips?  Seriously?  To top it off, the bartender was slow as shit.  I'll say one.. okay, two good things.  The happy hour is a good deal if you can stomach the food.  They also have a pretty neat lobster claw game where you can \"win\" a live lobster.  Might be worth going in there just to check it out.",

Typically, this would not be the case unless the place was slammed and leaking extraneous guests, but on this night there were not a whole lot of folks in-house.  The food was so-so.  Chimichanga was the best dish I sampled, but it was not impressive.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day.  The Sahara Rd. Vegas location is much better and much more accomodating.

Not that it was near where we lived, as all of us were in North Phoenix, but it was because we wanted it to be \"special\" than the other normal times we ate at the same Mexican food restaurants.    I think that is the highlight of this location.  It's a little different than other locations.  They have great happy hour specials.  Things get insane on Cinco de Mayo (at least 2 years we just ate at the bar because we couldn't even get a table).  It's Macayos level food, and a slightly more interesting physical location.  There are usually a few attractive college folks either working there or dining - and that can at least add to the overall atmosphere.  That said, occasionally large groups of said college folks can have the opposite effect.  You have to take your chances.",

I thought well yeah all the people from Ohio who moved here probably complained. But they finally did something that makes me say ENOUGH. We went here today and like always I ask for the hotter sauce right away. The kid brought some. Well that's what he said. He had a blank look on his face and NO PERSONALITY, so I was not sure if he messed up or was just slow or stoned. ANYWAY I kept looking at it. He finally said, \"oh you think I brought the wrong stuff, no they changed the formula a few weeks ago.\" It looked EXACTLY like the regular sauce. He admitted it was not hot at all and he didn't like it either. I can not stand it. If you are going to make the food more bland you CAN NOT make the hot sauce the same. That was the ONLY stuff that made the food better than Taco Bell. So for two of us, with no appetizer and no alcohol it was 45 bucks with tax and tip. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!",

They had uncooked potato wedges that weren't edible, spaghetti w alfredo sauce that was coagulated and cold, burritos filled w beans and rice and slathered w jalepenos also cold and tasted the best of the absolute worst.  Drinks were no big deal and overpriced for happy hour.  Big mistake going here.  Both hubby and I can't stop talking about how bad it was and how we got ripped.  8-18 just wanted to update.  Told the manager at the time how bad it was and the food they served wasnt food.  He insisted that it was food and told me that he would send me an email with a coupon to come back and have dinner on them.  I never got an email.  He was full of it and could really care less.  During happy hour they kept telling us that the premier marg was only .30 less than the house which was over 7 bucks.  Dont make the same mistake!  Go somewhere else!!",

After 10 minutes we received water.  10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders.  Then it was another 15 before we received the drinks! Then another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out.  One of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made.  A shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp. A chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos.  Another beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating.  So what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated.",

James was on top of it, within minutes he came out with my food, took my cc and brought me back the receipt.  Food was delicious (very expensive though....red burro, green tamale and a appetizer platter  $32.00 plus a $5.00 tip) James was great though, I love Macayos....even though it is getting to be a bit expensive.

We were told the Chimichanga was invented here..this one big as a burrito and is very meaty with a nice flaky crust yummm. The combo platter was great for trying a bit of everything you couldn't decide on from the menu too. Kids shared it along with some tacos. We'll definatley return again.",

Unfortunately the food and drink didn't measure up.  I sampled the spinach con queso, sour cream chicken enchiladas, cheese enchiladas, fajita quesadilla and beef taquitos.  Generally, the food was heavy and dull, with little in the way of interesting spices or flavors to liven it up.  Macayo's take on the quesadilla will disappoint cheese lovers, as it is mostly filled with meat and peppers.  I made the mistake of ordering the \"special\" blue margarita, which had a splash of blue curacao.  The server assured me it would taste just like a regular margarita, but it was dreadful - the cloying sweetness completely smothered the lime tartness I was craving.    If  you go, enjoy the fun interior but don't expect a breakout Mexican food experience.",

It really does not encourage you to come inside. The place once was more of a destination restaurant, rather than just a place to eat some crappy Mexican food (yes, Filli Bs is probably better).

    "text": "Since some coworkers requested to come here for their birthday, I begrudgingly complied. You'd think that in five years a location would improve enough to at least earn an extra star. This is not the case. It's been over five years now since I've been to Depot Cantina. It'll likely be another 10 before I return.  With seven of the ten already at the location that would be joining us for lunch today, the first person we spoke with stated that we had to wait for the others to show before he would sit us. Mind you, they weren't busy in the slightest. So we stood. Waiting. Eventually, another individual came by and kindly offered to seat us, that it wasn't a problem.  That's pretty close to where the good stops, sadly. It took over an hour to get our food. Our waitress at one point apologized, stating that it wasn't really her table (even though she's the only one we dealt with the entire time). And even when we did get our food, my order was incorrect not once, but twice. After the second round, I chose to forego any further attempts by them to get it correct. I don't blame our server really. She seemed very busy and likely didn't have the support she needed.  Also, if dust or cobwebs bother you, don't bother coming here. Most of the light fixtures and the various ledges around the venue are covered in cobwebs and a thick layer of what looks like very old dust.   I do not recommend Macayo's in any way, shape or form.",

I didn't actually have to pay for this meal, but I certainly wouldn't spend my own.  The places itself is rather cute. The restaurant is an old train depot and the patio is large and colorful.    First, the bartender was eating behind the bar. He was CHOWING on his takeout Chinese. He was nice enough, but yeah...  Our servers were prompt and friendly as well. It's just that the food is really not all that great.  I mean, it's fast food Mexican and that's fine; but the prices are too much for the quality.  The appetizers we had were basically as if they were purchased at Costco.  The chicken dish I ordered had a massive amount of hardened cheese and the refried beans and rice were hard.  Meh.",

I usually go to the one on Central Ave in Phoenix, but the concert was in Tempe so this is where I ended up going. The only difference between here and the one in Phoenix is the fact they have combos instead of the Mex and Match. The combos come with rice and beans and are $11 or $12 can't remember which. The guy substituted the rice and beans for the tortilla soup but I guess it is up to the guy running it if they do that or not. The quality of the food was amazing.

Food was outstanding this visit. But they have a huge management problem at this location. Coming from someone with a degree in hotel/restaurant management and who owned a restaurant i would immediately replace the General Manager here. Our food took forever to get to us. The waiter was rarely seen because it seemed he had tables scattered all over the place rather than in a specific section. The manager did come over to let us know they had a mix up in the kitchen and they were making our order now. By the time the food got to the table 45 minutes had passed. 4 entrees at 1:45pm on 12/22 with maybe a total of 5 tables in the place is disappointing. We all ordered chimichangas. 2 Baja, 1 Woody's original, and a kids combo platter. My daughters food did come with the side of French fries like we ordered. But our chimichangas did not come with any side at all despite us ordering rice with them. When the waiter returned to check on everything we asked for the rice that had been forgotten. The rice never came at all. Nor did the manager come back to see how things were. If I were running the place I would have triple checked the food leaving the kitchen to make sure the order was correct and I would have gone over as a manager knowing there had already been a mistake to make sure everything was perfect. The manger did remove 50% off the bill which I did not ask for. All I wanted was an apology and a explanation. I appreciate the gesture of the discount but I would have preferred him coming over. He just had our server tell us... I tipped the server at 20% of the full bills value with out the 50% discount and we left. I don't think we will be going back at all. It's to far and certainly not worth it...",

The food here is average, a little quick and sloppy, especially at night with the college frat boy kid rush. The security / ID checkers are pretty nice, the waitresses and hostess are pretty air headed, I've been here around 5 times, same experience each time. For example, I asked \"Did you see me come in here with ___?\" Both girls at the front stared at me blankly, \"Umm... I dunno, I don't really pay attention, ha sorry.\" Then they went back to talking to each other before I could respond.   Macayo's always has pretty cool events though, but those are separate producers of course, they never have enough events at the back area events either... staff is also pretty rude to me, and I'm always event staff, ignoring me and complaining when I said the main staff didn't get any food.  This place is good for people looking to scarf down some quick faux Mexican food, preferably a young person, college crowd, \"bro\", \"frat\", idk I assume someone that likes fart jokes. I does not appear to be good for children or families to me... not good for dancing. Get's 21+ around....7pm I think. Awhile ago I went with some older friends around 9, there was literally no one there, odd night, and 1 security guard with the kitchen still open. My friends went inside and used the rest room, got a couple drinks and I stood outside shouting to them by the ledge. Then we left.",

I asked for a fork which our server never brought so, once again, we had to get up from our table to go find another server.

I've ordered fiesta players, taco platters, fruit platters and rice pans in the past and always had the same great experience. Ordering is easily done over the phone and payment is done while picking up the order. The prices are fairly decent. The food is always delicious. My only problem is that the customer service is not always the same. There has been poor customer service a few times and other times above and beyond support. It's never consistent. Overall, I would recommend this place for catering needs.",

The food is good but the last few times I've been the service has been subpar at best. I want to reference the last server I had. I went with a big group with some out of town friends who fell in love with the place and we had come in after another big group. The waiter was communicative in regards to the kitchen messing up the previous groups order and had to fix it. Since we had apps and chips and salsa it wasn't too big of a deal but we were getting a little frustrated. After being there for two hours, the waiter tried his best by giving us free apps on our next visit. He gave us all these cards that required purchase of an entree. Our out of town friends said \"thanks, but we are from out of town and that doesn't really help\" the waiters response was absolutely appalling, \"looks like you're going to have to make some friends then.\" After a two hour wait and messed up orders at our table I felt like that was a terrible response and terrible thing to say to guests. We ended up getting 20% off our checks which was something but it was tough to make up from the experience.",

We had a party of 19 for a 30th birthday party. Having a party of 19 I would think you should have more help as a server. Some of us arrived around 5 for the happy hour which was particularly surprising at how good the happy hour pricing was. The appetizers came out very quickly and were palatable! The queso and cheese crisps were two of the best appetizers we had of the baked zucchini, sweet corn balls and quac. The homemade chips and salsa was also amazing!!  I did have three margaritas and did not catch a buzz at all. For me food cancels all disappointment in services and alcohol. The main courses were two of the best that I have had in a long time! Kudos to Macayo's on their skills of cooking amazing Mexican food!",

    "text": "This is the 2nd year in a row I've come to Macayo's with a large group because the space, location, decent food and reasonable prices have made this place a convenient go to spot. Unfortunately after this recent visit our large party will be looking to go elsewhere. I understand it is difficult with a large group and only using 2 waiters for over 30 people can be a daunting task but if you can't handle the heat.....  The waiter was asked to start orders with the birthday guest and his fiance who sat at the end of the table making it easy, it did not happen. Since we had so many in our party some had to sit at a separate table, no big deal. What was a big deal was never being given menus, asking 3 times for silverware, and 3 or more times for refills. My kids and another guest at the other table got their food  but then waited 10 minutes for silverware to eat it with. There didn't seem to be an issue keeping the booze flowing at the other table, perhaps because more booze, more money, more tips.  When I finally got my two Angus \"where's the Beef\" tacos (see photo) they were cold, complete with a saucer of a few small spoonfuls of black beans and Calabacitas for the bargain price of $12.49.  At the end of the evening there was an extremely long wait to get checks, they failed to realize or tell us they could not split so many. A beverage was added to mine but removed when asked but they could not split the bill for 2. But to take the cake...when they all finally got straightened out and only the birthday guest was left waiting to pay he got stuck paying for a bill of extra drinks. The waiter told them that someone left without paying their bill. I'm not sure how that could happen since everyone that ordered booze ordered food.  No birthday dessert so I guess that was his gift from Macayos!",

I opened the container they forgot the chicken! At this point I have to go back to work as I am on my lunch break. So I called spoke with Sydney advised her they forgot the chicken and could I speak to her manager. She puts me on hold for 2 minutes, comes back on the line and says.

    "text": "My friend and I were out and about and decided to stop for a margarita. When we arrived at the bar, the counter was sticky as if a drink had spilt and never wiped up. Once the bartender approached, we asked him could he wipe it up and he just answered with \"what can I get you\". I repeated and he just shook his head and said OK. We both ordered margaritas and once they arrived, he still never wiped it up. The margaritas tasted like sweet juice. We had to ask someone else to wipe off the counter. As we sat there for about 15 minutes, we looked around and noticed two other young women walked in and were seated and served chips and salsa right away. Our bartender noticed we were watching and approached us and said \"I'll bring you ladies some salsa and chips\" we both said to each other, \"now he want to bring us salsa and chips\". I've never had salsa so liquidy in my life, so much so that I couldn't scoop up the salsa to stay on the chip. The final straw was when he picked up two margarita Senorita mugs to serve 2 other ladies, looked in them and I guess he noticed something in the cup. He blew (what ever was in) it out with his breath, both glasses and proceeded to line with salt and pour in the margarita. My friend and I looked with disgust. We both decided that we were DONE but would inform the manager first. On our way to see the manager, we passed by the station that serves the chips and salsa. If customers were able to see the area in which they are being served from, they would pass on the chips and salsa! It was disgusting...dirty, dried up food matter all over, also the station where they drop off dirty plates and cups with leftover food still on them.  After informing the manager of my dissatisfaction snd letting him know we WERE NOT paying for our drinks, he said that he would talk to the bartender. Not good enough for me, we will NEVER go back there again! As I was leaving, I didn't feel right not informing those ladies that the bartender had not cleaned out the mugs they were drinking out of but did blow out whatever was in their mugs.  EWWWWW! That entire experience put a bad taste in my mouth for all Macayo's. Would have not given any stars at all but that was not an option!",

We placed our dinner order and even the food runner was awesome! We were just amazed at the quality of service from everyone we had any interaction with. As we were paying the bill we asked to speak to the manager so we could let him know what a fantastic job everyone did. Again, fantastic job to them all!!!! Oh, and the food was great as well!!! We will certainly be back again soon!",

The best thing I can offer up to say, The waiter, was on top of his game, He checked up on us frequently, If I could only remember his name.  I was here for a late, late lunch, As I was leaving the girls were pouring in, The patio here is nice and big, I should have stayed and made them sin.  The grilled fish tacos were just okay, Served with a side of \"baja\" sauce, Stuffed with a little cabage, After I ate I had to floss.  With my burrito I got rice as a side, Got my plate, that wasn't the case, Instead of rice it was black beans, No I didn't punch him in the face.   This place goes off on Cinco de Mayo, However I don't really care, I'd just end up sitting in the corner, Girls in mini skirts I would just stare.   Aribba!!!",

Inside the burrito is rice, refried beans, and I chose chicken over the option of shredded beef. The was some good spice used to heat up the meal and my tongue was on fire. But the tortilla was bland, and I could have whipped up the same type of meal at my house.  The patio area was the highlight of the restaurant, and had plenty of tables, and a large fountain, which created the illusion of water in the 98 degree heat.  $5.99 + $2 = $8 + tax and tip.",

We went on Cinco de Mayo, and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to. I thought that at 5pm, we could slip in, grab a table in the bar, grab food and beverage and get on our way.  To be quick, and to the point, the service was good, but the food was absolutely garbage. Bland, flat, uninspired...   Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop), the 20 year old manager, and the horrific food, I'll go out of my way to not go here again.",

Macayo's forgot several meals, yet constant reminders managed to get them served well after everyone else had ate.  Forget dealing with macayo's planners, they fail big time!  They might be OK with onsies and twosies tables, but I wouldn't count on that either.  Taco Bell would be a better bet.",

    "text": "I visited Macayo's because I heard that they had a gluten-free menu.   We sat outdoors on the cute, pleasant patio. The environment was somewhat marred by the presence of cigarette smoke. I know business owners can accept smoking on patios, but they can also choose to make patios smoke-free, and I find the latter much more pleasant.   Service was pretty good, but our server did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. Although it was 3 hours before close, she started asking if we wanted to-go boxes about 15 minutes after we got our food.    I had beef fajitas and my partner had a burro. We also ordered guacamole. The guacamole tasted kind of gummy, and the chips were too dry, papery, and flavorless. Also, we found cucumbers in the guacamole, and later in the pico de gallo. Who puts a freaking cucumber in either of those things?  My fajitas were very bland in flavor. The meat was cheap and had been chemically tenderized, with the result that the texture was pulpy. Instead of seared, it was just browned. It looked as though it had been steamed in a microwave, to be honest. Also, they used too much tenderizer, and it took the top skin off of my tongue. Gross.   Refried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste.   My partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor.   We asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten. There is ZERO reason that flan should contain any gluten, so I am guessing their flan was made from some kind of mix. Again, gross.   I won't be returning to Macayo's.",

    "text": "The one good thing about this place is it is always consistent, the bad thing is it's always a consistently not good.    The margaritas are so-so, the food is so-so and so is the service - this time we lucked out and got an adequate server.  Most of the staff are poorly dressed and unkempt.  Make sure to order your next cocktail way before your first is finished so you get it in time.    The kicker, the state of the restaurant - it is dirty, unkept and in desperate need of a face-lift or at the very least a fresh coat of paint and pressure washed.  A friend that was with us stated that it's because college kids don't care about the environment that they eat in.  Looking around I pointed out the families and said that if they appealed to the families and the corporate offices in the area, they may have a better environment for guests AND staff.  So why do I keep going back?  It's never my choice.  I only go at the request of other and don't recommend them to anyone.  Have I contacted them about poor device issues?  Yes - management has reached out to me in the past but with each visit, it is clear to me that guest feedback does not effect how they run their business.    The good news, it's America and they can run it however they choose and as long as they are in the black, they aren't going to do anything to change.  Can't argue with that logic I suppose.   I would suggest their Jimaca summer salad though - the dressing is the thing that made it great but I am going to be on the hunt for Jimaca for my salads at home.  I'll just keep going to Fuzzy's for my mexican food and entertain my friends at Cafe Boa.",

The venue is very large but it's organized well enough where you don't feel like you're in a swarm of people.  I've been to a few events there as well (in the back, outside area) and it's perfect if you want to be apart from the rest of the restaurant.  If you don't know what to order, just pick anything with the Baja sauce...it's amazing.  If you haven't been here on Cinco de Mayo, it's a must stop.

    "text": "Rating this place could go any number of ways, depending on where you sit. Due to the roundabout way in which we entered, we managed to experience a little bit of everything here.  My wife and I agreed to meet the in-laws here on a Friday night in order to hand off our daughter for the evening. They got to the restaurant long before we did in order to enjoy happy hour with some of their co-workers. So, when we entered, we did so through the patio area.  At first glance, the patio seems amazing. It's extremely large, has awesome seating, and has full bar. There were awesome heaters throughout in order to remove some of the evening desert nip out of the air. By the entrance, there was a DJ. His music was definitely quite loud, but I figure that's to be expected.  After just a few minutes, I figured out why the DJ had his music turned up so loud. As I was looking up at the stars along the back wall of the patio, everything on the patio seemed to go completely mute. An airplane passed by overhead that sounded like it was coming from the bar! It was SO loud!   Thankfully, once we arrived, the in-laws wanted to head inside for dinner. While we were at the hostess' stand, I took a look around. The place seems to have been decorated by a child. There are random nick-knacks absolutely EVERYWHERE. Steering wheel hanging from a ceiling fan? Check! Inflatable monkey hanging from a different ceiling fan? Why not? There's really no rhyme or reason to any of the decor...though, maybe that's what they were going for. It does seem to be a place geared more towards the younger crowd.  Decor aside, making the move to eating indoors turned out to be a wise one. Our server was fantastic. She was knowledgeable and extremely polite. In spite of the fact that the place was extremely crowded, the food arrived super fast. I can only speak for my meal, but my Baja Chicken Burro was quite delicious. It had just the right amount of spice to it, and it was massive! I could only comfortably eat half of the thing before throwing in the towel and springing for the to-go box.  Great service, good food, gimicky decor, and SUPER loud patio. If you can get past the bad, the good is pretty good.",

While I was sitting at the table and just got chips/drinks when I felt something brush up against my leg. I look down and sure enough there is a rat that climbed half way up my leg and then scurried off behind the bar. I didn't make a scene and waited for my boyfriend to come back so that I could tell him we needed to leave. The waiter approached us and could tell something was off and I privately disclosed to him that there was a rat. He said \"oh well if you told me that after you got your food I could have given you a discount, sorry\". We didn't even stay long enough to order anything and left. Unfortunately I will not be returning, I used to love to go to this place after ASU games. This experience definitely ruined it for me.",

The patio was filthy (I know its outside but it was awful- and half the chairs were broken ). Very disappointed- I will never eat here again!!",

Good portion of sour cream and guacamole, too. My husband got the green chile enchiladas. They were a tad on the spicy side (for us, we are wimps), but had good flavor.

First of all all the parking spaces are narrow so regardless of where you park you are barely gonna fit. I remember it being a light colored newer VW bug that was parked on the passenger side(the side of my car that got keyed) It is so juvenile that someone would do this unless they had a good time at the restaurant (drinking) or they have anger issues. Let just say I will NOT recommend Macayo's Depot Cantina on Mill nor will I be going back.",

I do like that Macayo's allows you to park there and gives you a gift card to offset the parking fee - good for them because you know you'll spent more than the gift card amount.    The food was good.  With the nine of us we ordered a variety of things - fajitas, nachos, tamale bites, cheese crisp, etc.  The service, however leaves a little bit to be desired.  It took a long time for us to get drinks and chips and salsa.  We probably sat there for a good 10 minutes before a server even came to take a drink order.  It looks like our server was overloaded - he stopped by and said he would be with us as soon as possible - and then we ended up with a different server.    This is kind of a tradition for us but the service hasn't been so great the past few times - not sure we will continue.",

It's pretty clear that I love Mexican food. And I appreciate the regional variations, as well as the degrees of authenticity. I would never claim that Macayo's is the most authentic restaurant, but I will happily proclaim its consistency. No matter the surroundings, in this case a train depot theme, the menu offers variety, value and lots of delicious options.  If I had the time, I would've ordered my favorite appetizer, the Green Corn Tamale Bites. The dipping sauce is outrageous! But I digress.  I actually found the Macayo's Depot Cantina by accident. I parked in their lot. So while I'm the area, I made my way over and ordered a simple, but satisfying lunch special. It was Monday so I got the Quesadilla with some rice and beans. The portion was good and I got my daily cheese quota covered.  The decor was a little different from other locations, but I liked it. Especially the rail cars and cabooses sitting out back. It's close enough to work that I'll probably drag along some co-workers next time. Gracias!",

Water constantly empty.  Chips empty.  Asked for lemons and they never came.  And to top it all we went for lunch and they gave us dinner menus. When she came to the table after sitting for 10 min and I asked for the lunch menus she responded \"I'll look but I don't know if I can find any\". Seriously? Oh ok. I'll just pay dinner prices at lunch if you don't have any. She finally came back with lunch menu's but wouldn't have if we didn't ask.  2. Atmosphere - they ask us if we wanted to sit by their pond. Sure! Why not?  We had the pleasure of looking at the cups, forks, menu, paper and other assorted trash items floating around in there.  And no...it wasn't windy out today at all.    The food itself was not bad but we all agreed we would never go back based upon everything above.",

Granted, it was a slow evening, so I can't speak for the service during busy nights.  When ordering, I wanted some fish tacos and was going to order the beer battered \"seasonal fish\", but the waiter urged me to get the seared ahi tacos (which was the most expensive taco item on the menu).  I agreed and wasn't happy with my decision.  The ahi is a great portion-- but for my taste, they were way too heavily salted.  The waiter saw I wasn't happy with his recommendation and brought me the beer battered fish instead, which were probably the biggest and most delicious fish tacos i have ever had.  One of the managers came over and made sure we were ok, and they even deducted the price difference from the original fish tacos.  I hate complaining about food, but these guys handled it like pros.    My only complaint is the margaritas were weak, but I was expecting that from an $8 Patron margarita.  There was a group of about 20 seated near me that seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I would definitely bring a large group here.",

Overall the quality of the food and ingredients was so sub par I couldn't believe it. Just nasty, low quality fare that makes Filibertos look upscale. (And I like Filis)",

Based on reviews, I didn't expect much, but my experience didn't even meet the meager expectations I had set going in.   The server, whose name I cannot recall, came to our table maybe twice outside of the initial order and serving of food. We had to wait forever for drink refills, the people who arrived later were forced to linger tirelessly while the server attended to the rest of the restaurant, which was roughly 2/3 empty.   We ordered several appetizers to start: Mini Chimichangas, Beef Taquitos, Fiesta Wings and Nachos Supreme. Every last bite we took of each item was mediocre-at-best and the chimi's were lukewarm by the time they arrived.   Upon venturing into Macayo's we all assumed we would order actual meals too but because of the slow, substandard service and the barely-edible food, we passed on entrees. We paid for our food and left.   Will not return.",

This place has an awesome outdoor patio bar and seating area and is convienently located next to a light rail stop. The inside decor is fabulous and the piece de resistance is the chandelier made from Corona bottles.  The menu is comprised of your traditional mexican dishes like tacos, chimichangas, burritos and so much more. I have tried numerous items from the menu but sadly have not found anything that wows me so much that I want to eat it every time I go.  I advise to ask for the spicy salsa when they bring you your chips and salsa.   The downside to this restaurant is that the service is never consistent. More times than not I get seated in a location that everyone forgets about and so it takes forever to be waited on.  Often times when I request a special order of no tomatoes, since I really don't like them in most of my food, I still get them served with my meal anyway.  Despite these inconveniences I still return.",

My margaritas (and I had several different types) definitely tasted different than any of the many margaritas I've had all over the place (not bad but maybe just weak and lacking tequila with certainly a \"different\" kind of flavor than I've ever had before).    The food portion size was very large but the wait staff got a bit irritating with constant upselling (we had a new wait staff being trained by a manager and the manager was over the top exaggerating the upsale).  We had ordered queso but thankfully with all the focus on training the upsale they forgot about it and my old boss and I were full to bursting.  The menu descriptions also seemed to be a bit different than what we received but we just drank more and let it slide.",

The margaritas are pretty good and they do margarita flights with different flavors. They're good, but a bit sweet for my taste from all the syrup they add. My waiter last time told me the regular margaritas are pre-mixed, whereas the Patron margaritas are made fresh on the spot. The price difference between the two is quite different.  They do have a good happy hour, with some $3 and $5 food options, as well as some decent drink deals. However, I'd only recommend going for happy hour since their food is just okay and not worth the prices for how much food you get. Taco Tuesday is also a good time to go.  Average food, but a pretty good vibe and plenty of nice outdoor seating. It's definitely not my go-to for Mexican food, but it is good option if you're in the area.",

This place has an old town feel to it with a large outdoors seating area as well as adequate indoor accommodations.   After looking at the menu for a few minutes, we settled on a carne asada chimi with rice and beans, Baja chimi, and a chicken enchilada for the Mrs. we were promptly greeted and had our drinks and chips with salsa in a very short time. As I checked in on my yelp app, a free cheese crisp coupon popped up. Don't forget to show that to your server. It is more worthy that the salsa and chips are delish. I ended up mixing the hot and mild together, yummy!  As for the main course, it came out promptly and served with a fresh order of chips and salsa. Usually retried beans seem to have a lard texture and flavor, but none of that was present here. They were good and had plenty of flavor. The rice had plenty of flavor with a slight touch of heat, perfect for most appetites. My carne asada chips came topped with a spinach queso sauce and stuffed with steak and pico. Very tasty, very slight presence of fry oil, expected of any fried food. I couldn't help but clean my plate. I haven't done that in a while. M son finished his Baja chicken chimi as well. It was served enchilada style with a jalepeno cream cheese. The sides chicken enchilada was very good and had plenty of flavor, a theme that was well covered in their food.  I apologize for the lack of photos, it was just to good to wait to eat.  Noteworthy, our server Gibson deserves cudos. He was prompt, kept our glasses full, and chips and salsa flowing. Hats off to him for the excellent service. The manager Jeff is equally attentive and helpful. Good service seems to accentuate the good food. Try it out, you won't regret it. If you see Jeff, tell him young Huskers sent ya.",

    "text": "I like how Macayo's is a good place to have a large group. They have a huge patio, but it can get really warm in the summer. I had some mini beef and mini vegetable burritos. I didn't like the mini vegetable burrito much. The mini beef one was better. However, I feel like it still needed a bit more flavor. This is where the salsa came into play. The salsa tasted good and the chips were crispy. I also had a cheesy dip, which tasted good as well. I wish they came around more often to refill the water glasses, though. After the meal we had the chocolate mini burritos. I thought they were ok. I wasn't a fan of so much flour tortilla. I think it would have tasted better if it had a thinner shell.",

Our server got the drinks wrong, the food order wrong and didn't even know what was included with our food on the menu when we first ordered. The presentation looked like they literally threw something together as you can see in one of my photos. The food was terrible and so were the drinks! Such a RIP off. They also made us wait 15 min when waiting for our change from $100 and then brought us back change in $2 bills. Racism are its finest!",

    "text": "I had come in with a large group of people for a corporate lunch weeks prior and was exited to bring my partner back to enjoy a great meal! We came in after 8PM on Monday night and there were large parties on the patio, and basically dead inside the restaurant. We sat at the bar for a quick meal and were greeted by someone slicing limes (it was her first day, so there's that). We were asked right away if we wanted drinks and that it was Margarita Monday and there were specials. We were given menus and then back to lime slicing she went. I had to ask about the specials, which she relayed, \"those prices might be wrong so don't quote me on that.\" Well, what are you here for then I asked myself; the turning point where we should have just politely left. The ambiance was very very strange. There were a few people at the bar surrounded by a dozen empty Modelo bottles and dirty plates that couldn't understand when the bartender told them they were out of wings, and one other party in the bar area. The bar area was visibly dirty and you could only hear crickets. Yes, the bugs the actual bugs all we cold hear was CRICKETS. Gross. We ordered two classic margaritas which were \"maybe $7 on the special\", which were AWFUL (I spared telling her they were garbage, sugary watered down tangy crap to be exact). Still no offer if we wanted water or chips & salsa, no music, nothing. There was a bartender that was pseudo assisting the new girl, but there was a lapse of time where no one was behind the bar. Another employee loudly shouted, \"well I guess I'm making my own drinks!\" and \"looks like I'm the bartender too!\" it was horrific, especially with many years of industry experience we share. We couldn't get out fast enough, but it was all for good luck as our change was all given in $2 bills! Moral of the story you may ask if you've made it this far through my rant? Head over to Fuzzy's Tacos on Mill Ave you will be much happier.",

My partner got wings, and for the record the original wings come out spicy red so if you want them plain you have to specify that. I also ordered the Arizona sunrise margarita which was really good. Fish tacos tasted like fried grease on tortillas. The sangria was pretty much straight Merlot. The waitress was very nice and replaced all items we were not satisfied with. I probably won't come back for the food but only for the margaritas.",

While the first 30 minutes of our visit, we were welcomed and treated like respectable patrons....that went down hill with a change of staff. We had a large, generous party and was neglected almost the entire time.  We had to get our own water, silverware, bus our own dishes and order our own drinks at the bar even when there were 4-6 servers in the area and an empty bar area.  A glass of water was accidentally tipped over and not one employee approached is to help.  We had to locate napkins to clean the area. One person asked for water and was promptly told that person was not her server yet no other server was sent over.   My friends and I have been this Macayos before and this was by far the worst service we've received...not only from Macayos but in the entire Tempe area in the last year.",

I wanted the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler plate, which comes with a beef enchilada, a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. The plate also comes with rice and beans. I specifically requested one beef enchilada and two cheese enchiladas - no chicken enchilada (I don't eat chicken).   When I finally got my food and opened it up at home, I was severely disappointed to see one chicken enchilada and two beef enchiladas. I guess it was my bad to not check the order when I was picking it up, but still. The beef enchiladas were OK but the rice and beans were gross. I only had two bites and threw the rest away.   I won't dine here in person because the atmosphere is not my scene, and I guess I won't be ordering take out from Macayo's again. There are many other Mexican restaurants in the area, so why bother with subpar?",

Not a single acknowledgement from our server Meredith until exactly 6:03pm.  Ask us what we want and told her if we could still get happy hour drinks since we had been waiting for a while. All she said was \"looks like you just missed it\" umm more like you did, but ok.  Ordered drinks and apps and mind you maybe one other table was in our section at this time.  We place our food order and shortly after two tables get sat near us. An hour goes by and no sight of our server. Our drinks are empty, we never got water and we realize this night is gonna be a total buzz kill.  We finally get our food and it was clearly sitting in the window too long. The chicken in my tacos were burnt and inedible. Rice was...crispy? Friends chimichanga had queso on it that was crusted and yellow. And again our server was non-existent. We literally had to go find someone to attempt to pay our bill, along with the table next to us who was having the same issues.  Spent two of the most frustrating hours I've ever had at a restaurant. And then at the end when we let our server know how bad our experience was,she yells at him and says \"well it's not my fault they over sat me!!!\" . Um ok, thanks for the apology.  There's so many wonderful eateries in this area, this is a forever pass for me.",

They had samples of the fried zucchini and Mexican fresca. We were seated promptly and immediately had a great introduction from our server Brian and the manager Jamie was quick to come by and introduce herself and enticed us with the new mud pie (which was incredible) and let us know she was available if needed. We ordered the combo platter, coincidentally we both wanted the same thing so we would have leftovers. The food was fresh, hot, and so delicious! I will come back again. The overall experience was the best I've had anywhere in a while. Go in, if you can ask for Brian, and just enjoy the experience.  In October I visited the Desert Sky location and that was not nearly as great of an experience. Like polar opposite. So I was hesitant to check out another location. Ran into Jeff and he said to give it another chance and I finally decided to check out one of the other locations. Not all experiences are the same. This one tonight was worth the trip and I'll absolutely recommend this place to everyone!",

The kids menu includes a \"build your own taco\" with basically a bento of taco fixin's.  Brilliant!   Service was great.

This is as authentic Mexican as P.F. Chang is to Chinese food.   However - the staff was great and very friendly. So its not their fault they work for a chain. But I can sum up my experience in one phrase: not worth the calories.   Pro: location, size, and staff.  Con:",

I'll say this, one of the stars is for the cool host Issiac and our server was fast. One-ordered a jalapeno margarita, no jalapeno margarita here, had to have a pineapple margarita- which was not good and the jalapenos were cut into what looked like chunks of green bell peppers. Ya, I drank it, I had been craving a margarita all day. The second star was for the tortilla soup the only thing served hot that was edible. My boyfriend ordered a crane asada burrito which was served lukewarm with cold beans and rice that tasted like they'd been sitting around all day. The cheese wasn't even kinda sorta melty inside and the meat tasted dry and old. Literally, it was not even edible. Overall, I felt really disappointed we spent any money on this at all but complaining to the server makes me feel like a jerk, it's not his fault the food sucks. Never again.",

The overhead fans and fixtures, as well as the rear car lights on the walls were greasy and Dusty and full of dirt - disgusting! The place is old and funky and that's OK but dirty is inexcusable for a restaurant. I had a carne asada burro and the others had chicken and beef enchiladas. Nothing had any flavor at all! My steak was like it was cooked that morning - tough, then microwaved at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The flour tortilla was brittle, dry and tough and the others complained that they couldn't even cut into their enchiladas! This is the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten! The management response to this review will not change our minds. We will never be back!",

How did we get charged 2 different prices for the exact same margarita? All the guy could tell us was that it wasn't a 10oz pour? Excuse me! We first ordered 2 of the $3 margaritas. Then I had a 2nd one and my husband ordered a beer. They refused to even correct the problem even though it wasn't our fault. We specifically ordered \"2 of the $3 margaritas, please.\"   NOT TO MENTION the fact that we waited over 10 minutes for them to even greet us after being sat at the table. The place wasn't even busy! We sat on the bar side on a Saturday night (Aug. 8, 2015). Only 5 tables were occupied at 7pm. Should have been a warning!  We ordered our food and were tended to by 4 different people that night. Not sure who was our waiter! When I ordered off of the 3-course menu I was told that I could not take off the nasty red sauce in exchange for green. It says on the menu that you can't substitute anything, but it's just sauce that I didn't want. Didn't think that I was breaking any rules by asking for green sauce instead of red sauce. Unbelievable! For the record, I was sick after eating the red sauce and sick to my stomach the next day.   If you want a bad experience, poor service, food that tastes like metal, and to be over charged come to Macayo's Depot Cantina! I'm sure it will be a meal that you never forget!   WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!! Much better places to eat than this place.",

California was showing no signs of ever opening up the job market soon so I did what I had to do.  So far, I'm really liking it and finding some cool new places to go and great places to eat.  MacAya's is one of those discoveries.    After spending two weeks with a group of people in a training class, some of us decided to go out and celebrate with lunch on Good Friday, which was a half day for us.  The company was great and I found the place very easily so that was a plus too.  I thought the open patio was awesome and I can see this place hoppin on a Friday or Saturday night.  Even at lunch they had $2 beers!    The service was a little slow, the chips and salsa were ok, and my enchiladas were pretty good, not great, but good.  Honestly, I think it's the atmosphere that got me though.  They had this big outdoor bar and lots of space on the patio, lots of tables and chairs.  I loved the outdoor waterfall too.  So in my opinion, the food is a 2 and I'm giving it another start for the atmosphere.  If you don't expect much when you go, you'll be fine  :)",

After standing around awkwardly for a few minutes waiting for someone to notice us...a guy that was busing tables came over and told us to have a seat anywhere.   After a few minutes, we got our menus and placed an order. Service was kind of \"iffy\", as we had a few different guys bring our drinks/app/entrees. The taquitos app was tasty, and when our server brought out my rather naked looking burrito, he asked if I wanted any sauce on it which was nice of him.

Honestly, it tasted really good after I put that salsa in there. The absolutely best part of being there was the DJ they had that was playing 90's rock i.e. Nine Inch Nails, Bush, Sublime, 311 etc and some of the new hip music. We were very impressed.   We weren't impressed with the waitress. She was lousy, not very attentive and took so long to get back to us. The place however was huge I did not know I was sitting in a  patio until my friend lit her cig and I finally looked up hah. It was clean and nicely decorated there was a large bar off to the side of the patio and a large fountain. It has a really good vibe to it. We were there early so I could only imagine how it was going to be later on that night.   So besides my waitress being inadequate everything was cool there.

I'm a creature of habit and stick to the chicken chimis. I most certainly have my ceramic margarita glass that I take with me for a dollar off my drinks too. Mmmmm...Tequila.",

Sat in the bar at a pub table and was not waited on, had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes and told him what pub table I was sitting at.  He was pleasant and under the circumstances, no fault to him the place was spread thin.  So he had to come out from the bar to help serve, it was a given our plates wouldn't be picked up cuz the bar was busy.  The carne asada tacos were just ok, not much flavor, I did like the beans veggies.  Horrible ownership and management for something like this to happen.  The service was as bad as I ever had, again not by the server, but there was not waitresses or waiters, never heard such a thing.",

I met up with some friends here some Fridays ago and the outside patio was loud and insane. My friends wanted to survery the scene so outside we sat, straining to hear each other. A couple of top shelf margaritas later, we were still waiting for dinner. I shouldn't put my expectations too high - I ordered fajitas and they were just ok. Nothing special. But I had to order dinner because taquitos wasn't going to cut it.   I will give them this, though. They have one salsa which is H-O-T. My generous friends let me have at the whole bowl. Serrano-less pico de gallo only goes so far for me.   So, well, am I going to go out of my way to drive through hell-ass traffic on the 202 on Friday after work just so I can sit at the Macayao Depot patio? Probably not. Although drunk Buffy and Taffy were pretty amusing.   But this place is what it is, and I shouldn't have expected much. And it doesn't make much of a case for me to try the Macayo's on Central but you know, stranger things have happened...",

I had made a reservation for a surprise party and our hostess was less than secretive when I brought my fiance through the door. She just pointed and said \"Yeah, they're in there\" -thus giving away with the fact that others were waiting for him. We were then greeted by our server. The first thing out of his mouth was \"You guys splitting checks?\" We were. He then told us \"K. Make sure to not move around the table then. You'll make it confusing for me\". I started to feel guilty about sitting in his section. Like we had done something wrong. Anytime we asked him for anything he replied with an annoyed look on his face and said \"Yeah, give me a minute\". Over and over. He left the table before getting everyone's drink order, forgot things, and we had to one person's food through the manager. In short, he sucked.   Shotty service aside, the food was AWFUL also. I ordered the Steak Cortez and every bite was pure fatty nastiness. Won't be going back.",

This was not the case. Immedietly we were put off by the manager at the front desk demeaning the staff around him. We had to stand and wait to be sat while he proceeded to yell at them. Later we asked our waiter what that managers name is and he told us his name is Casey. It took forever to get to our table, but when we finally did our server was wonderful. We ordered enchiladas and fajitas which were decent but overpriced for their quality. The margaritas on the other hand tasted so good I wanted more.

First time I came it was fantastic! Second time, food was great but service wasnt spectacular. This time was terrible!   We sat in the bar, when we showed up there were only 3 or 4 other parties. The bartender, Ben was our server too. There was another gentleman serving as well. It wasn't busy at all. We got our beers right away, but took a while to order our food. Food came out pretty quickly 15 - 20 minutes. After we got our food we were not checked on. We did get our beers filled though. Ben kept running into the back of my chair everytime he passed by and never said a word to me. It became quite annoying. No one was even sitting behind me. He wasn't very personable either. I was also charged for a side of burrito sauce, 1.99. I understand when restaurants charge for guacamole or sour cream but for a base sauce? I only wanted a teaspoon to flavor my bland burrito that I got.   It took us about 25 minutes to get our checks and cash out as well.   Food is mediocre, but service is beyond terrible. It's unfortunate because they have a great venue, but no friendly staff. I probably won't go again while visiting in the future.",

I have had my birthday here with my family(10 guests), drinks with friends(2-4 guests), and also my marriage celebration dinner(30 guests). All of which ran smooth and exactly what I wanted.  Most recently Macayos Depot Cantina was the location for a party I hosted for my best friend. I couldn't be more happy with how it turned out, and my guests shared the same opinion! We provided the restaurant GM with our budget and size of our party and he provided the perfect amount of food for the number of guests in attendance(which was around 40).   We went with a buffet style arrangement and when any item began to run out, our servers were quick to replenish! The food was fresh and I received lots of compliments on offering such good food at a baby shower! Thanks to the kitchen staff!   We had a perfect size section of the patio where we were able to seclude ourselves from the rest of the patio but still able to enjoy the atmosphere. We decided to allow anyone who wanted alcoholic beverages to do so on their own and we had plenty of staff come through often to check on everyone. Crystal was one of our many servers who helped our party that day and she was absolutely awesome! Being the \"host\", I was in 20 places at once and when I asked for the cake to be brought out from the fridge, she brought small plates and extra forks also, talk about anticipating customer needs! And when I tried to clean up at the end she insisted I leave it to them, no complaints from me...  Thank you to everyone involved! I have been meaning to leave a review since my wedding dinner but hadn't gotten around to it. With all the compliments I am still receiving on hosting my most recent party, I cannot thank the entire staff and management enough. Anyone who has had to host a large party for any event would know how hard and stressful it can be, let these guys take care of you!",

    "text": "I must say, Macayos has been hit or miss with me. I've had rather decent experiences, while many of my friends have had varying experiences. Some good, some bad.   Today, me and a group of three others decided to come and eat, and, while we were generally pleased with the food, the service was less pleasing great. Our server, definitely didn't provide the best service for various reasons, but, worst of all, he managed to upsale us multiple extras without telling us that these extras had an additional costs. He plainly asked if we wanted cheese, sour cream, and avocados, with our meals, without any indication these would cost extra. We were surprised and mentioned it after we saw the bill and he seemed more confused and just apologized before leaving and finishing the tab. He mentioned if it happened again to go to the manager, which confused us since he was the one who caused the problem.  I'm not sure if he was trying to increase his tip or was instructed by management to upscale subtly, but I found it deceptive and disappointing. I've worked at multiple restaurants and have many family members who are high up in the restaurant industry, and this sort of practice doesn't fly in most establishments. If you come here, be wary of what you order and of what your server asks if you'd like with your meal, and don't be surprised if they soon start charging for refills on water.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner on Saturday night. We were hoping to sit out on the patio, but it was extremely dark and deserted so we opted out. It turns out the patio was closed anyway, which was kind of surprising on a nice Saturday night. We were seated right away and overall the server and service was great. Our server was very attentive and friendly, he definitely made the night.   I ordered the prickly pear margarita and it was absolutely the SWEETEST drink I've ever had, it tasted like I was drinking straight margarita mix. Ugh it was awful and there was barely any alcohol in the drink at all. Very disappointing.   I got the chicken fajitas and my boyfriend had the enchilada sampler. The food came out in literally 10 minutes or maybe even less which was pretty impressive. He enjoyed his meal for the most part but it was definitely nothing to write home about. My chicken fajitas were good but I was very disappointed that it only came with 2 tortillas! Usually fajitas come with at least 3 or even 4 tortillas! I just ended eating the rest of the chicken and vegetables plain. Yeah I could have asked for more tortillas, but at that point I didn't even want to bother. Again food was decent but really nothing special.   AZ has so many great Mexican places but this place can't really hold its own food wise.",

It was unpleasant to see that nobody came to clean the table and chairs from the thick layer of dessert dust outside.  Overall still worth the visit just some details to take in consideration.",

Took 20+ minutes to get waters and when we asked for chips and salsa he just seemed annoyed. I asked a question about an enchilada on the menu and his response was \"uhhhhhh, ummmm I guess\". Nobody got refills or anything because Dennis was nowhere to be found. I went to go look for him when my son's dinner never came and I found him in the kitchen area talking with a handful of other waiters.  I like the food but the service is always an issue and is just getting worse. Maybe next time someone wants Mexican we'll have look for a different place.",

I'm so unsure as to why someone wouldn't give this place at least three stars.

I told her I wanted her to come work for me and she politely declined. She kept our drinks refilled, and my Baja chicken burro was incredible. The second time I came in, no one greeted us for 10 minutes. We had to ask for chips, our waiter looked like he had too much to drink the night before, and we saw a RODENT.

I'm kind of surprised its still in business. I went there most recently for Sunday football ticket with 5 friends. It may have been 40 minutes between rounds despite us being just one of two tables. We had to ask a number of times before anyone brought us anything. Terrible experience from a bunch of unmotivated college students. Our server had a Cardinals Rodgers-Cromartie jersey on. If he waits on you, be prepared to WAIT on him. Lazy as hell.  Bottom line is there are a number of better places nearby, pick one of them instead.",

Mainly because I have never ordered anything off the menu, and I have only gone on Friday nights. I am a college kid and there are three things than any college kid loves: 1.  Free Food- They have a buffet style chips salsa and queso bar that equals free friday dinner to me! 2.  Cheap Drinks- Gotta LOVE the $2 Dos Equis 3. Fun Music- Yes, they do take requests on the patio.  I have danced away many a night at Macayo's Depot Cantina!! and it gets a five star rating in my book!",

The buddy that I went with said \"man, the last time I came here, the service was BAD.\"  Why I didn't heed his comment and go to any of the other 50 restaurants within a 2 mile radius, I don't know.  We walk in the front door, and there are 10+ people waiting to be seated.  No evidence of a hostess, nothing.  We stand there for maybe 5 minutes, during which time several various employees walked through the room, none of who payed any attention to the fact that there are now about 12 people waiting for any sign of life and ultimately a place to park our rear ends and get a menu.  We decided to go into the bar area, which was pretty full with the same vibe of no employees, lots of patrons, nothing happening.  By some miracle, we were finally seated by a mute hostess, and it then took about 10 minutes to hear from anyone else.  From the time we sat down until the time we left, about 1hr and 10 minutes passed.  Every step of the way was us waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for the drinks, (just WATER by the way.....no bartender required) waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for water refills, waiting for our check, waiting to wait for something else.  The food - decent, but who cares.  Not going back there anytime soon.",

It is authentic.  It is consistently dynamite.  I can't say enough about the high quality of the food... Macayo's just never disappoints.  What I never got to appreciate as an employee there is what an incredible and lively atmosphere it is to dine in.  The patio is a blast.  There are lots of people, good music, plenty of shade, misters when it's hot, tv's to watch the games on, and servers on top of their game.  When our meal was finished, we cruised inside to the cantina where the atmosphere was just as energetic and buzzing.  They've got an impressive selection of tequilas and killer margaritas to enjoy.  The bartenders and cocktailers always seemed to be smiling.  Overall, the service was outstanding, the food delicious as always, and the atmosphere great.  My friends and I keep Macayo's Depot Cantina on our list of regular stops when we choose to hit up Tempe.",

The rice was light and flavorful -- even the beans which I don't typically eat were good.  My friend ordered the carne asada burrito and it just didn't compare to the combo.  Definitely go with the combos here.",

Shortly after eating the salad then suddenly felt ill. He couldn't even finish his beer. He threw up violently for the next several hours missing the football game completely. We are convinced it was the lettuce and poor hygiene from the kitchen staff. Just wanted to share this in hopes the restaurant reads and monitors the sanitation activities of this location. Hubby said he'll never have their food again.",

I ordered a Baha Chimi; their \"signature\" Chimichanga stuffed with your choice of meat (I had Chicken), topped with Relleno sauce, Macayo's Baja sauce, and cheese. I went for the grande dinner option, which adds refried beans, rice, sour cream, and guacamole for an additional 2 bucks and change. It was pretty good, nothing mind blowing. Their Baja sauce is unique, and quite tasty. By the waiter's own admission, nothing on the menu is truly spicy. They didn't even offer hot sauce in a bottle...eek! We sat outside under the patio cover and the music was a little loud for casual conversation. Overall, it felt more like a college bar that serves decent bar food, than a restaurant.",

FYI, If you go here during a tempe event you can park but you have to pay $20 to do so, then they give you a ticket that you give to the waiter to get your $20 back. If you want some tasty mex food and alcohol this is probably the best spot to go in the tempe/mill area. Lot's of people watching and places to sit.

Wife and I have been here for happy hour at least a dozen times since we moved to downtown tempe and the appetizers are good and the drink specials great also.  Had Mom in from out of town and figured we would walk down there for dinner.  Bad decision.  I had the chicken pablano special with rice and beans.  Chicken had a sour taste, rice was salty and bland at the same time (?) and beans were taco bellish at best.  Wife had smothered chile relleno dinner and thought the enchilada sauce was one of the worst ever.  Note to Macayo's: enchilada sauce should be red not ORANGE.   The only dinner that was edible was Mom's appetizer sampler plate. Go figure.   I'm thinking the reason we could eat the happy hour food was maybe they serve frozen appetizers and the rest of the menu was made by someone who has absolutely no idea what mexican food should taste like.  My advice, have all the food shipped in frozen and you might be OK with the great location and friendly servers and bartenders.",
