    "text": "Came in last night for probably my 5th or so visit here since they opened. Sad to say i continue to find the overall experience lackluster at best. It looked like the menu had changed from my previous horrific dining experience here with basically unedible and horribly overcooked food when they first opened...so I went for a happy hour special. Pretzel and beer cheese? Sure I'd been in for beers since then, but I'd always hesitated to order anything to eat. But I have a soft spot for pretzels and cheese!! Sounds great! Sadly, it was another huge let down. The pretzel was clearly store bought and soggy with a sad off-white color to it like they didn't even bother cooking it to the specifications on the box it came in, the beer cheese was not much better. I appreciate that they appreared to have made the cheese, however it started to congeal after about 30 seconds, the joys of Velveeta. Sure it was a happy hour deal, but it was gross and shouldn't have been served like that.   The waitress, while friendly was really uneducated when it came to beer and seemed to be either unaware or just oblivious to the fact that there was a beer event and special beer tapping happening for beer week. She took one person's order and then didn't come back for 20 minutes while everyone eagerly waited to get their chance to order the specialty beer. I really don't find this place to be a fun place to hangout and have beers and don't recommend it, I have given it several shots and came up empty everytime.",

    "text": "I discovered this place on Yelp as part of my research for craft beer-serving restaurants near our hotel. We've been to Four Peaks brewing. We've been to San Tan Brewing. I enjoyed both but for our very quick, less-than-24hour-trip, we hoped to find something close to the hotel with a menu that didn't mirror standard bar fare.  And did we find it! We wandered in to see a sign that said \"seat yourselves\" so we found 2 great spots at the bar and settled in. Our fabulous tender of the bar was David who quickly made it known that despite him being busy, he was there for us and that we were going to get along great. And we did. Fun conversation and camaraderie aside, David knew all there was to know about their beer list. Including all the specialty sours on tap. Now, I'm an IPA fan. But after a tiny taste of the Sour Gose, I was intrigued. I ordered another sour which was red in color. As David put it, it would be a cocktail to enjoy especially if I was a red wine drinker. Milder in sour-aspect and bright berry flavors. For sure! It was exactly that in a way I can't even describe. I even went back and ordered the Gose.   David spoke very highly of the menu and their chef and explained that they roast all their turkey in house as well as make all their sauces. My husband and I ordered the Farmer's Fry Basket to start which was a delicious combination of fried okra, fried green beans (the best!), corn fritters, spicy pickles and cheese curds served with a spicy aioli and a cool tzatziki. The green beans were seriously the best I've ever had with the perfect amount of batter.    Next we decided to share the turkey street tacos, which I had seen pictures of here on yelp. It came with a side David suggested that we choose the poblano that was stuffed with a sweet potato mash and bacon with the spicy aioli. Wow. All I can say is yum! The roasted turkey was moist and flavorful with cranberries and fried sweet potato shavings on top. A perfect flavor and texture combination. I had mine in a corn tortilla whereas my husband had flour. We each enjoyed our tacos and the stuffed pepper was fab as well. The pepper itself had some nice heat to it which you don't always get in poblanos. The mash and bacon was a perfect combo and we would order it all again.   The next time we visit the Phoenix/Tempe area, we will definitely be back to explore more of the menu and craft beers!",

    "text": "I'm traveling here for work and decided to try my hand at what appeared to be a well reviewed restaurant.  Before I dive in with my breakdown, the only additional detail I want to add is I ordered via the GrubHub app and the delivery was quick compared to other places I've ordered from.  My order consisted of Turkey Sliders and the two popular items, SOS Queso and Build Your Own Burger.  The turkey sliders were quite good.  I've never had a curry slaw before and I would certainly order it again.  I was looking forward to the SOS Queso.  I read and heard good things about the dip and just reading it from the menu made my mouth water.  As I am someone who loves a little spice in my life, I decided to go extra spicy.  When I received my food, I found the appetizer to be not at all what I was expecting.  If you are familiar with opening up a can of Rotel and mixing it with a block of melted Velveeta, then this dip is for you.  As we know what happens when you make that cheese dip, it hardens rather quickly and I considered myself lucky that I had a microwave to re-melt the dip in...I pity those poor patrons at the tables in the restaurant.  As far as the dip being \"extra spicy,\" they might as well have poured a little bit of Tapitio hot sauce on top of it, because judging by the looks, taste, and smell of it that's exactly what they did.  Highly disappointed.  There were a fair few burgers to choose from so I decided to build my own.  I love my burgers with a bit of pink and in the instance of the build your own, you are allowed two toppings, having to pay for any additional toppings.  I decided to go with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and pay the little bit extra for a 3rd topping, caramelized onions.  When I received my burger, I was happy to find I had bacon and a pink center, but that's where my happiness ended.  The cheese was not pepper jack but provolone.  Additionally, I was given raw onions as well as two big slices of tomato, a topping I didn't even ask for nor do I care for and generally ask to leave off.  I can understand the burger coming with lettuce, which this one did, and I don't mind...however...when I see on a menu that a burger comes with tomatoes, I always ask they not be included and nowhere under the \"BUILD YOUR OWN\" does it indicated such a topping is automatically included.  If it were, then why is tomatoes and option under the toppings?  Needless to say, based on the fact that I received a very generic and overpriced burger as well as very generic and overpriced Velveeta/Rotel dip with some Tapito poured on top, I was not happy with having to pay as much as I did for what actually can be called a good tasting meal.  The food itself was good, but for the price you are paying, be cautious.",

I must say I think I could eat the stuffed poblano every day for the remainder of my life, it is that good! They also have a good selection of beers.  Location: The location is nothing special, its just in a small shopping center. However the actual restaurant is rather cute and fun.  Service: The only thing that kept me from giving Spokes on Southern a 4 or 5 star rating was the service. We seated ourselves and it took 15 minutes to get a waiter to even come by our table. Beyond that food took an hour to actually receive after we saw it waiting in the window for about 15 minutes. My food was cold, I actually asked the waitress if she could pop it in the microwave for me,  which they cant after you have taken a bite. This does speak volumes about their food however because it was cold took an hour to get and was still stellar, then again maybe I was starving. I do think they were short staffed, but there were only about 7-10  guest their. I think If I do go again I would see about carryout options.",

The staff are all fun people who are easy to talk to, Cooper, the manager, works his ass off and does a great job keeping up with everything. Our favorite bartender there was Dave, he is hilarious.   As for the food, I am a vegetarian and they have some great options for me. I usually got the veg head sandwich or the carver burger and subbed in their amazing veggie patty that they make in house. My boyfriend loved the salmon BLT.  They always have rotating beers and you can always find something you'll love no matter what your taste, and a large number of them are local AZ breweries. They also have great Moscow Mules!  The restaurant is cute with the bike theme and very specious so it doesn't feel overcrowded. They have a lot of fun stuff like trivia nights and darts in the back, and in the daytime they are usually a bit slower so it's a good place to hang out. They also have a patio which is wonderful when the weather is nice and it sits right on the edge of a little business park/lake.  I recently moved out of Tempe and I can honestly say that Spokes is going to be one of the things that I miss most about it.",

You better believe they will get what they want before the rest of the bar, whether it be drinks or songs. I am very upset with the establishment and the karaoke company they employ. This is not the first time that I have come to spokes and been denied a song.  Although we spend a lot of money at spokes, I don't believe I will be in to 'say hi' for a while.  And if I could find the karaoke company's yelp page I would have a lot more to post. But I'll leave it at that.",

Sorry folks, I will just stick to my Coors and Budweiser. With that said, maybe this is wrong of me but Spokes is not really my type of place. Even when ordering my \"crappy\" beer it took a while to get a bartender and be served. I felt like it was a place where all the beer coneseuirs come and chat about beer - smelling it, takign a swig and swishing it around in their mouth, talking about the ingredients, and talking about how badass the brewery is instead of a place where you can have a steady stream of Coors Light sitting in front of you. Which is fine, I just personally don't really have a desire to talk about such things.",

I ordered the garden salad replaced the turkey with grilled chicken.   So here's the nice touch...I had just picked up my dog from the groomer and was hungry. I looked up places with outdoor seating and found this place. I called ahead to see if it was ok to bring my dog Desiree. The guy said of course. When I arrived I just walked directly to the patio which is right by this pond with ducks and swans. Really cool. A couple of minutes later the host brought me a glass of water AND HE BROUGHT MY DOG A BOWL OF WATER! one of the patrons came out for a smoke and actually asked if I minded if he smoked while me and Des sat there. This place has definitely got themselves a return customer!  **edit: so I sat there and ate my healthy chicken salad which was ok sized and delicious but was still hungry so I ordered some chicken wings which I found out were discounted because of happy hour... Happy hour IS ALL day on Saturdays! *chuh-ching! I wondered what my dog was so enamored with and noticed the pond was filed with big fish and even a turtle that crawled up the rock! What an awesome dinner! (No my dog didn't eat the fish or turtles lol). ***edit 10/3/15 me and my dog came closer to 1pm this time and the food was just as delicious if not better. Service was great as usual. One of these days I'm going to have to eat indoors here. It looks awesome lol...",

Seems that they are often running on a skeleton crew with employees running the inside as well as patio. My recommendation, designate a server to the patio whenever possible! Sat out there and found the service to be slow. Can't complain about cheap decent drinks! Had the Moscow mule, made spicy by substituting the vodka with jalapeno infused tequila.. YUM! I love their cauliflower wings as a vegetarian, who typically lacks bar food options. The hot sauce is delicious - will mAke your nose run. Guacamole is fresh but hardly any flavor.. not enough lime juice or jalapeno. Would be a higher rating if the service was more attentive.. took nearly 10 minutes to get waters. Again, I understand going between inside & outside.. seems excessive to have one worker making drinks at the bar and taking both patio & inside tables... take what you can handle. Another piece of advice, greet the table with waters made! Everyone needs water in Arizona summers anyhow.",

My favorites are the stuffed poblano pepper, turkey enchiladas, pesto turkey, pork sliders and the garden salad. HH menu go-tos are the wings, pretzel and fried pickles. HH is a great deal.     The bar tenders and staff are friendly and attentive. We have had had a long wait for food one time only. Great neighborhood spot and dog friendly. Hell, the customers are even friendly. We have NEVER had bad service.   You have to take Spokes for what it is. They have a very good selection of beer a very nice selection of alcohol and even have a decent selection of wine- it's basic but decent. The food is not gourmet by any stretch but it is very good bar food.",

I ordered the spinach enchiladas and requested that they make them easy on the spinach and kale, more cheese, since I'm not a huge fan of spinach or kale. They did a great job.  This was a great way to force myself to eat some kale, and I actually liked it better than if it was just a cheese enchilada.  The rice and beans were actually quite good too.   The service was excellent as well. Our server had to go to the kitchen to ask a lot of questions about the menu, but then she admitted to us that she actually was sort of moonlighting here -- she is a waiter at another restaurant and is just helping out because they had a big event here this evening. I'm really glad that they did make a point to have extra wait staff, because we had no trouble getting excellent service.   Really like the overall ambiance of this place.",

I am sad to say that due to repeated episodes of bad service, that will not be happening.   The first time we tried this place, it was right before Halloween.  The bartender dressed as Duff Man was really nice and knowledgeable about the beer.  He is the one breath of fresh air that we have experienced here.  The next two times, we walked our dog to the patio, hoping to enjoy a pint before the walk home.  Both times, we were neglected by the servers for very long periods of time.  The second time, we waited 10 minutes just to order a beer.  We asked for just a few more minutes while we decided if we wanted something to eat.  Thirty minutes later, the server comes back to ask us if we've decided.  Yeah, we decided about 20 minutes ago when you completely disappeared that we no longer wanted anything else because no server was anywhere to be found.    The servers act as though the patio is an afterthought.  I don't know if they pull double duty and serve inside and outside at the same time, but if that's the case, it isn't working.  A few servers should probably be stationed outside because the service on the patio is severely lacking.",

No. Just my view from my table at Spokes. This bicycle themed business is next to a shady pond with all of the lovely animals mentioned above. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at 11am and the sign said to seat myself and I did. I was the only person around, but my server spotted me quickly, took my order, and brought some ice water. She checked back with me several times during my meal to make sure I was doing OK.   I had the steak burrito (very tasty) with waffle fries ($10). The background music was Billy Joel, Crosby-Stills-Nash-Young, etc. A half a dozen flat screen TVs were scattered around the spaces (all tuned to sports stations for some reason). They have a gazillion beers on the menu, but what I was really craving was some apple cider and did not see any on the menu. Hey, it is autumn and not everyone likes beer. I know this is an ale house, but a nice Redds Apple Ale would have been nice.  The place looks clean. Parking is close to the door. The view makes me want to bring my grandchildren (they would love the ducks and turtles), but they do not appear to have a kid's menu and seem more set up for sports fans and bar patrons.",

We didn't feel rushed at all. Unfortunately, I was unable to try any of the beer since it was to early for me to start drinking.  From what I could tell, they had a decent enough selection and I liked that.  Place was open and airy with plenty of seating and a nice relaxed feel to it.  Overall this place is a good little spot.

    "text": "This place is so promising, you start out with the cool cycle-centric design similar to the new PedalHaus Brewery on Mill, and you add in a little dart board and ping-pong table action in the back (like The Yard) and top it off with a great list of craft brews on tap...you'd really think this place is going to be your new hang out. Then, you show up...  First of all, this place is deserted. It's a weekday, lunch hour, surrounded by businesses of all kinds a place like this should be hopping. Instead there's maybe 2 tables filled in the whole place. At least it'll be quick, right? Wrong. Turns out there's only one waitress and one bartender on duty, during what should be the busiest time of their day.   The menu is bare bones, with a bunch of weird riffs on \"southwestern\" food with attempts to elevate them with things like feta cheese and spinach wraps in burritos. We ordered the jerk seasoned wings, and we received some overly crunch wings that taste seasoned, sure, but definitely not jerk seasoned. The food was bland overall, decent portions, but definitely overpriced for what you got. To top that off, it took a good 40 minutes for us to get our food (4 people) in an empty restaurant. Craziness. To top it all of  the food was completely cold. If you're going to make me wait, at least make sure the food is hot when it shows up.  The real bummer though was the beer. I ordered a Goose Island Sofia right after we ordered our food. 30 minutes later, no beer. We asked and the waitress had forgotten completely. She went over and made the order with the bartender and the beer finally showed up about 15 minutes later. Honestly, it was nothing like described and the \"sparkly\" beer tasted quite flat to me. I gave to one of my lunch mates, he seemed to like it ok but he also enjoyed horse stable flavored wines (a review for another time).  Overall I'm guessing this place used to be a nice spot for lunch, I'm not sure what changed exactly but I'd strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The 4 star average must be for a spot that doesn't exist anymore. Go to PedalHaus if you want good brews on tap and the bicycle design features. if you want to play games while enjoying an afternoon happy hour go to The Yard. Skip this place. Great little location, but a waste of space in the end...",

Yesterday a group of us we're buying drinks during the evening and when our friend brought a drink, the bartender made a comment to him about the tips we were giving to him. He stated that he was mad that our table wasn't tipping him enough and called one of my friends carpal tunnel girl. Regardless of how much we tipped (many of us tipped generously but now I regret it), it is unprofessional to state that especially to a customer who is apart of that group. We know the service industry is hard and customers can take a toll on the work day (we weren't any trouble) but the way we were thrown under the bus has now caused us to take our business elsewhere.

The first time I was there for happy hour, but decided to get the salmon BLT with sweet potato fries and I think it was a great decision. For $10 or so you get a nice piece of salmon in the sandwich and most likely you will have to take half home. This place also has about 24 beers on tap to chose from including sour beer! I love sour beer but it's sometimes hard to find it on tap, and this place had 3 different kinds! Second time was also during happy hour, and I decided to try the turkey sliders for $3.99. They were good but had a very strong curry slaw on top of it so if you don't like curry you won't like the sliders.   Happy hour goes until 7pm which is nice and they also have a reverse happy hour starting at 10pm.",

The place we were planning to try was closed and I had just heard about Spokes the night before, so we decided to try it. We had a great time hanging out on the patio. There are Adirondack chairs! The patio overlooks a man-made pond too, which is lovely. I love that we didn't feel separated from the rest of the place just because we were outside, since there is a wall-sized opening from the inside to the patio. The service and the food were both great. I had the kale burger with curry slaw, bunless since I am gluten intolerant. If you're a fan of sweet potato fries, you'll be happy to know you can get them here.   The only thing I wasn't in love with was our table, because it was incredibly wobbly. Easy fix, but that means someone actually has to notice and stop to fix it. Please check your tables for wobbliness, Spokes! Thank you. :)  Oh, and If you want soup, don't go on Sundays. Soupless Sundays. I don't know what that's about, but...no soup for you.  I can't speak to the beer or alcohol selection because I didn't imbibe on that evening, but I'll definitely be back to check it out again soon. I can tell this will be a new hang-out spot for me.",

The bartender argued that it is what I ordered when in fact I was just taking her own recommendation. I don't remember her name (angel wings?) But she took the beer back and never brought me another beer. Even after my buddy said he would drink the one she brought. I had to order from the other bartender. Then service went downhill from there..... So .... make sure you verify with the bartender what you want before she pours. If the food is ok and there is nothing special about a place, then they need to have good friendly service if I'm ever coming back!",

The standard cheese basil tomato one was ok, though the cheese had been sitting at room temp so long it was mushy. The turkey one was cold and very dry and hard to eat, and the pear one had extremely unripe pear. The caramelized onion on it was ok and we tried it without the pear, but I don't love eating straight onion on bread. I am not sure how you miss pear being that unripe, it was crunchier than an apple, it would have had to be like cutting through a carrot. Fyi spokes, that's not what pears are supposed to like. The poblano was tasty, but cold. Slightly below room temperature. Not what I expect when I order something that's roasted. The cheese had congealed on the top, and there was barely any filling. The wings were ok, if a little bland. The waitress didn't come back to check on us for quite some time so we ate it anyway, we were really hungry. We will never be back, that was the most disappointing meal I've had in a very long time.  I'm not sure how there's so many great reviews for this place...",

    "text": "Came here a couple of times since a co-worker lives across the street and that made this a convenient place to meet. Same mall as Sweet Tomatoes and the southeastern branch of Los Reyes De La Torta. They've got a bicycle theme going - hence the name Spokes. Bicycle tires make up some of the decor and a few bicycles hang from the ceiling. When you walk in, you can go straight ahead to the back area of the bar or turn left and sit at one of the seats around the main bar. We sat at the bar and chilled. I had all sorts of crafty beers - can't remember the names now so I probably had too many. They give you a sheet with all the names of the available beers but I had to download the app instead - YES! they have a Spokes On Southern app! - mainly because I had to squint and use the flashlight app to read their tiny font beer list. Lindsey was our bartender/server and she was very nice - always smiling no matter what. Food - no soups in the summer, by the way. That was not mentioned on the 2 pager of a laminated menu. I had the turkey and bacon enchiladas. It hit the spot and was quite decent. Friends ordered the burger and Bruschetta Planks. This place also has one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes you can control from your phone via app. Unlike most places, this jukebox doesn't block out any songs - even the usual censored \"explicit\" labelled ones. Pro tip: if you wanna get on Lindsey's good side, fill up the jukebox playlist with requests for Operation Ivy tunes. Will be back for sure sometime.",

It is a lot larger than I thought, with a nice patio space and a huge area in the back which is where our group was seated. Everything was pretty average, I had a southwestern turkey sandwich and some cider. What I can say though is that they set our server up for disaster. We had a reservation and they only assigned one server to our group, so it took about 2hrs for us to all get our food, and even then there were some issues with wrong orders. Not our servers fault , and I would hope that a smaller party wouldn't have the same wait as us, but I was surprised that they would set it up like that. Also, the music is pretty loud inside.",

    "text": "Went here with my boyfriend and his daughter because his co-workers raved about it...Either we cam on a bad night or their tastes in food is whack.  Anyway, was so excited when my boyfriend said they had these awesome (sounding) Grilled Cheese sandwiches.  I chose the bacon and pear.  My boyfriend got a burger and so did his daughter.  We also the the app with all the diff fried veggies.  For drinks I got an Angry Orchard cider (wanted a heff but server said they don't have any... really??) My boyfriend go some other cider thing. and then since it was Sunday and their Bloody Mary's were $5, I decided to have one of those too (it was a rough day).  So let's start with the app.  Most of the veggies and cheese curds were pretty good (pickles, green beans, not sure about the Okra because I don't like it, but the BF and his daughter ate 'em.  The corn fritter things tasted like corn and raw pancake batter on the inside.  Some of the smaller cheese curds were like rubber.  The spicy aoli was good, the taziki was whack.  It was not smooth with chunks of cucumber or just smooth is was like they put the cukes in a food processor and threw them in a cup.  It was just weird.  The cider was good and so was the ale/cider thing my bf got.  the Bloody Mary was horrible.  Mix was thin and watery (f it was a mix) didn't have that \"zing\" to it, just blech.  The Food.  The server said they cook their burgers \"pink\" in the middle and that is how he likes them.  Nope, well done.  Secondly, his buns were BLACK like completely burnt.  Who lets that get out of the kitchen, huh?  They do.  His daughters was very dark too, but she was hungry so she just ate it that way, he asked for diff buns.  My grilled cheese.  First off, it was toasted bread.  Not yummy, buttery, crispy, crunchy deliciousness you expect from a grilled cheese.  No oozing cheese (supposed to have Brie, Blue Cheese and Cheddar) no brie, no blue.  I asked the manager(?) when he brought out my bf's plate with new buns and asked him about the cheese conundrum.  I opened the sandwich and told him to look.  He says, \"there is a some blue cheese right there (it was the size of the tip of pencil lead).  He also told me that they don't put a lot of brie or blue because they are very strong and pungent cheeses.  Brie is strong and pungent???  And yes, blue is and I love it, so I want the flavors come out in the sandwich.  That grilled cheese was $9.00! I was very very dissapointed.  I make WAY better grilled cheese and it doesn't cost me $9.00.  The waffle cut fries were gross but I DID love their sweet potato fries, and they did taste homemade.  Service was great!  The bill was almost $70.00 for that crap, never again.  Even his daughter said she didn't want to come back and she isn't a food snob like my bf and I.  Sorry Spokes on Southern, looks like you gotta flat.",

    "text": "Great selection of a rotating cast of beers. Lunch and happy hour specials are reasonably priced. It is usually a seat yourself operation but the staff always brings water and menus within a minute. Food is quickly prepared and consistently good. Events like karaoke night and trivia, so check ahead! Great happy hour specials. The chicken tenders and anything fried are perfect bar fare. Vegetarians can always find something. Outside seating overlooks a pond--smokers can't control the wind so be prepared for smoke if you're there on a busy night outside. Overall , they've accomplished a friendly and quality neighborhood bar that can accommodate college students, young professionals , and retirees comfortably!",

I love their patio, the music has been really loud each time I've been so it's nice to be outside to just hang.  The servers are always very friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back.  (Perfect for after a sporting event and a rowdy group.)  Their wings are good....the queso on the other hand....pass.  It was crusty within like 10min, yuck.  The beer selection is good, limited to local breweries so don't expect Blue Moon or Coors...they have the good stuff!  The servers are very knowledgable and happy to hang and explain the different types and bring samples.  All in all, it's a great spot to hang and try a few new beers.  I'll be back when I'm on this side of town. :)",

It took awhile to get an ice water.  We placed our orders before water was brought to the table and my husband had to remind the waiter that he ordered iced tea.  We tried the queso which was extremely thick, much like under heated Velveeta.  We also tried the breaded cauliflower in wing sauce.  We chose medium sauce.  It was like steamed cauliflower in wing sauce, not great.  The burgers were good.  The grilled cheese was good.  The waffle fries were good.  The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, no crispy crunchy outside.  The ranch was tasty.  We were given no refills on water.  We have so many choices here, we won't return to such an average place.",

Our server this particular evening was new, but she was friendly, courteous and efficient. Her timing was a bit off and she wasn't familiar with the menu but she was quick with the answers to my questions, got our drinks delivered, appetizer and meal orders in to the kitchen and then delivered to the table in a timely manner. My Pumpkin Porter was perfect, thanks to the bartender.   Our appetizers was strangely good.  Go figure, cauliflower stepping in to replace chicken wings Buffalo style.  I'm a fan. Our entrees were tasty and a pleasant change from the usual.  That sweet potato, bacon and cheese stuffed Poblano topped with queso was even better than I imagined too.  Thanks to the other server that recommended it. Yum YUM!  Overall, two thumbs up.",

It could have been a bit better had my food been warmer. I could have sent it back but I was already starving!  It didn't lack flavor. It just needed to be a few degrees hotter and for me a bit spicer. I had the spinach enchiladas with the stuffed  poblano pe bed on the side. Pretty tasty and not low cal to be sure. Lotsa cheese but I was in the mood for a caloric splurge.   I could be enticed to make this a regular hang out, especially because they have trivia nights on Mondays. If they were to get bigger TVs I might just spend my Sundays here come football season.  Could have hung out here for a few more hours but alas, it's nap time!",

    "text": "Spokes is definitely has a small-town-neighborhood vibe, despite being part of a mini-mall off a busy road. A group of friends and I came by late on a weekend night after a long day of being outside - so we all were ridiculously thirsty and hungry! One of the guys suggested this place due to it's close location to us, and he'd heard good things about it's new ownership. I'm stoked he did!  Later in the evening it was sparsely populated and there was no host to greet. So since I drove myself, I just kind of wandered in until a few more from our group arrived and we picked out a large row of tables. A waiter immediately came up and began taking drink orders from the handful of us who'd already arrived. A few wanted to order food, and he didn't mind that he'd probably have to take a few trips to the table to get us all taken care of.   Their craft beer list is crazy long and made it a little hard to decide - thankfully the guy across from me let me try his and I went with it. I was also impressed with their menu.- lot of variety. Most of our group went with the build your own burger - cooked to how we specified - and with a side. So bomb, I seriously thought about ordering another one.   After done eating we made our way to the ping pong table & darts area - ID is required to \"rent\" them from the bar. Our waiter was totally chill about splitting the check and bringing them to us after we moved up there. Cannot wait to come back and try more beer and food!",

I thought it was really good. It's pretty laidback, and the type of place you'd feel comfortable bringing grandma & grandpa for a beer or even your kids...depending on the time of day, obviously (there's an area where there's games a few of which looked specifically for small children).   They have a really good beer selection that rotates. I believe most pints are $5 and a dollar off during happy hour.   As far as food goes, my friend and I split the queso dip and we both really liked it. I also had the turkey tacos on corn tortillas. It was shredded turkey w/cranberries, shredded sweet potato, and some sort of spicy aioli. They didn't completely knock my socks off, but they were still pretty tasty. Both these items were on the HH menu and were $3.99, which is a pretty good deal. There's about 5 or 6 items on the HH menu total. Other food items include turkey sliders & pretzels w/cheese.   The service here is good. I can't remember our waitresses name, but she was friendly and seemed knowledgeable of the beers on tap.   Also, this place has Golden Tee & Big Buck Hunter! I'll be back.",

The soup was good, but the portion was very small, not filled to even the smaller inner ring of the bowl.  It's a side, so I had no real complaints.   However, They charged me $2 extra for it, but didn't tell me ahead of time.  Waitress said it was on the menue, but removed the extra charge for me when I said I wasn't happy about it.     Food took a while to come out  and the service was pretty slow even though they weren't that busy.   The tacos were only so-so, at best.  I used to come here about a year ago and remember it being much better.  Corn tortilla was stiff and cold, meat was flavorful but had no char on it.  The goat cheese was non existent, maybe A couple of crumbs.  I have to say that the tacos were not worth the $12.50.  I'm cool with not having large portions,  in fact I prefer it as long as the food is good.   But small portions and mediocre food is a real bummer.  At least the patio was nice.",

I've tried the Salmon BLT (sans the B, which I got 15 minutes later), chicken fingers (tasted like old fryer oil), queso with chips was straight up inedible, fried veggie basket was limp and soggy, other assorted apps and such. All below par. I would rather eat at Los Reyes de la Torta and then come here to drink.  Because the beer selection is good. Very good. And the servers are good too. Plus chilling with the lake ducks on the patio is a good time (when the weather isn't actively trying to destroy you).   Also, the ladies restroom can be just a tad funky smelling at times. But nowhere near the infamy of its predecessor Sneakers and Native New Yorker! Thankfully they fixed that problem!  So two star food plus four star beer is a three star experience.",

They have a lot of beers on tap, and the price during Happy Hour are pretty nice too (they also have Happy Hour from 10pm-2am, that's a big plus!) We came around 10pm on a Thursday night and the patio was pretty full. I was able to bring my puppy since it was pet friendly.  The only downside to this place is that it took a while to get the menu, we sat ourselves since we came straight from the parking (because of the dog). The table was dirty (plates and glasses). But the waitress was very nice and efficient.  We will be back again for sure!",

The Salmon BLT and the Southwest Turkey are probably my favorite from the sandwich menu but the grilled cheese with bacon, avocado and tomato or the Pesto Turkey are always good, too. The burgers are good and the enchiladas won't disappoint. Pro tip: If you order the enchiladas, ask for the stuffed poblano pepper as your side. You're welcome.   The beer? Yes, these guys know beer. The wait staff is always super friendly and they'll let you know about what they are currently pouring. They have a nice outdoor patio that happens to be dog friendly if that is your thing. Their happy hour is a great deal so don't miss it. Cheers!",

    "text": "Wow. Another 5 star post. :) I don't know if anyone's noticed (that's just the insecure writer in me talking), but I post a lot of 5 star reviews. Not to sound conceited, but if I go to a place, that means its good.  \"I'm just sayin'!\"  I know that sounds bad, but people like me are destined to rub people the wrong way.  That will not happen at Spoke's though. \"Spokes On Southern\" if I'm being exact, instead of lackadaisical.  This wonderful restaurant and bar is right in my neighborhood, and even though we have so much to choose from in Arizona to spend our beer dollars, this is one of the places that deserves the whisking of plastic against a terminal. That charge on your debit card will never be regretted. The beers on tap change constantly, which provides the benefit of variety to customers like myself, and the satisfaction of plentiful choices to the discerning palette. Examples include the \"Piehole Porter\" and the local Arizonian \"Inebriator\". I would find it hard to believe that a beer lover would leave here dissatisfied-especially when you can get premium local beers for only $3 during happy hour. Their food isn't half bad either, and even if it was, the value you're getting would make McDonald's marketing executives run back to their holes to do another SWOT analysis.  My humble request is that you would try this place after seeing my review. The service is great, and the people who work here are welcoming and friendly. It's great for groups, a get to know you meeting, or just hanging out by yourself at the bar. The last would be me. A vote of confidence from your friendly  neighborhood mom & pop reviewer-no red and blue spandex. :)",

It was kind of weird because the salmon was fat and round, like a ball.  So you can imagine how awkward it would be to eat a ball in the middle of two slices of bread.  It was good, I love salmon, I just think they could have chose a thinner cut.  They had an excellent selection of craft beers and I think I may have over heard the bartender saying at least one was a nitro beer, oh yum.    I've been back several times with friends and the servers are hit or miss.  The selection of beer is excellent though.",

    "text": "We decided to come here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon after work. It is a self seating restaurant, and luckily we were able to find a place to hold our group. There were areas that could hold large parties, but there were two or three people that had occupied the space.  Anyway our server helps me find the place where we ended up sitting, then disappears. Doesn't come back for over 15 mins to take our drink orders. By then we all knew what we wanted to ear, so we placed our orders. Our food took a while, but it came out and they had forgotten something on everyone's meal, including all the dipping sauces. So of course we ask for everything and it takes another eternity for it all to come back. I had the boneless wings with Jerk seasoning. Y'all! These things were dried out and barely had any seasoning on them! But I was hungry and it's chicken on happy hour, so why not!  So we must have gotten our food about 6:30PM... Happy hour ends at 7PM. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted anything before happy hour was over - like is customary anywhere else that has happy hour. This woman comes back at 7:02PM (realized after the fact) and asks if we want anything. When I proceed to ask for the boneless wings (on the happy hour menu), she doesn't say anything. When I get my check, this woman done charged my happy hour price for one order of dried out wings (cool) and more than double the price for the second order. And she proceeds to tell me \"oh happy hour was over 2 minutes before you ordered.\" Y'all! When I tell you I had to grit my teeth to keep my composure! I didn't fuss. Paid for my food. They took ANOTHER eternity to bring our checks/cards back. A different woman brings them back, tosses the stack of them on the table, whirls around and leaves without saying a word. We all look at each other like *insert your own form of profanity here.*   This place is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. The service was appalling, the food was below sub-par, and it is definitely not worth what they charge you for. NEVER AGAIN!",

The beers they have on draft never disappoint! And they're constantly rotating so there's always something new to try!

When i mentioned it to the server he kind of shrugged and asked if i had ever had them before. Well, yes, actually, and they're not usually inedible (at other places).  So he didn't discount or take it off the check even though all THREE dishes went back unfinished. Talk about unaware.  Please also note that sticky tables and worn chairs make a certain impression.

So when they brought our salad out, it was Romaine, we sent it back for soup. They brought out a smaller Romaine lettuce salad. Again we sent it back for soup telling the girl that it had a warning on it. She said, I kid you not, well we just got that warning about an hour ago. And there she stands with a CDC salad in her hand. Then the tacos we ordered , carne asada, was like shoe leather and no taste at all, wrapped in a corn tortilla that was so dried out, I guess it complemented the beef perfectly Ugh. Then we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check and another 10 minutes waiting for the server to come back with credit card.",

My wife and I also love this place because it is very child friendly during the day.  Great place for all types of occasions.  Aw",

    "text": "This is the most overpriced and mediocre restaurant I've ever eaten at. Just for example, it's a bit over $10 for TWO measly tacos...and another $2 to add a third. The steak in the tacos was so over cooked I could barely even bite through it at certain points. Not to mention it takes forever for the food to be prepared, even when there's not a single other person in the restaurant (which is most of the time). I've also ordered the TWELVE DOLLAR southwest chicken salad, which I was pretty excited for until I realized it was a $12 plate of lettuce, with about as much corn, beans, chicken, and cheese a person could pinch with 3 fingers buried underneath. Seriously, I had to search pretty hard for the other ingredients. In conclusion, spokes has slow service, poorly cooked food, and drastically overpriced food. The only upside is that the employees are very friendly.",

    "text": "Spokes on Southern is my go to any time I am in Tempe because I absolutely love this spot. The atmosphere is relaxing whether inside or out, the food selection is varied, and the beer selection is numerous. Plus, they more than welcome four legged friends on their patio.   The major draw that keeps me coming back to Spokes is the revolving beer selection. They've always got 25+ beers on tap and the taps change monthly. Always on tap are the typical staples you'd expect, but rotating are varied selections from local breweries or craft micro brews from across the nation. I've discovered many new brews here and I appreciate their dedication to keeping the tap offerings fresh and exciting.  While nothing spectacular or out of this world; the food is fairly priced and quite good. They boast of sourcing fresh local ingrediants for all their menu offerings and nothing has led me to believe that is not the case. I'd liken the menu to stuff you'd easily whip up in your own kitchen (assuming you were culinarily inclined) and would enjoy eating. I've enjoyed most items on their menu including their brunch offerings and havn't had a single complaint about anything I've tried. A good restuarant should keep their menu short and to the point which Spokes does and does it well in my opinion. Nothing worse than when a menu is all over the place with too many different dishes.  Service is warm and friendly. Of the numerous times I have visited Spokes I have never left feeling unappreciated as a customer. Staff is attentive and more than willing to answer any questions and provide quick small samples of any beer I'm curious of trying before commiting to purchasing an entire pint.  I'll continue to be a patron at Spokes any time I find myself in Arizona.",

    "text": "I ate here for the first time 8/26/15 with a group of people.  I waited 10-15 min for a waiter to come by to take orders(who didn't bring more menus...). I got a seltzer water to drink and it mildly tasted like tap water/dirt. I had been there once before, but did not order any food.This time, I asked for the Veg Head Sandwich (Grilled portobello, red peppers, fresh basil, sliced tomato, and fresh mozzarella) with extra of the balsamic sauce, a gluten free bun, and sweet potato fries. It took at least 30 min for my food to come out (conveniently when I went to wash my hands), and noticed I had waffle fries instead of sweet potato ones. I nibbled on the rest of my food, waiting for the waiter to come around to get the right fries, but it never happened before I finished the whole sandwich. The sandwich was lukewarm (so much for fresh grilled portobello) and did not have extra sauce. I waited a long time for a barely heated sandwich. The gluten free bun was crumbly and rather tasteless, which I know it's not their fault, but I should warn anyone wanting to try it. Really, the whole sandwich was pretty bland, even though it should have been awesome with the ingredients used. Now that I think about it, I don't believe there were red peppers on the sandwich. It took 20+ mins after I finished eating to ask for a check from the waiter. I know we had a decent size group, but the place was nearly deserted other wise besides another group outside and maybe 2-3 people inside at the bar. The waiter was MIA so much, I wondered what he was even doing since the place was not busy at all, being a week night.  So, if you like to pay too much for bland food and poor service, this is your place!",

There are places all over the restaurant and patio to lock up your bike, being a bike-themed restaurant. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the lovely afternoon. Kyle was our server, and we was always around making sure we had enough to drink, that our food was ok, etc. Just really friendly staff, but not overbearing. My husband had the turkey sandwich, which to his surprise was real carved turkey, not pressed deli meat. I had the smoked salmon Blt, which was delicious!! The waffle fries are amazing.  The next trip we sat in the dining room, and I really like the ambience of the place. The beer menu had been updated since our last visit (they rotate through kegs of craft beer, but there is always Bud light on the menu for the less adventerous). They also keep a cider on tap, which is awesome. Right now it is Sam Adam's Angry Orchard cider, which isn't my favorite, but still better than no cider at all. This time around I tried the shrimp tacos with a side salad, while Matt had the Salmon BLT, again both of us enjoyed our meals, and we had Kyle as our server again, so the service was fantastic. I haven't tried any desserts yet, but I'm looking forward to that on my next trip!  It is so nice to have a local restaurant within biking/walking distance of my neighborhood with good food (not typical bar food), and a great craft beer selection.",

I was a little irritated about the long wait until I realized the ladies sitting next to us had been there since before us and they got their food way after we did.

    "text": "I went here Sunday afternoon w/ some friends. They seemed pretty busy for only being open a couple days. My group started with the queso dip appetizer. The dip had a very delicious cheese flavor, the tortilla chips were crunchy and fresh.  While waiting for the appetizer we ordered some flights of beer. They were out of flight glasses so they ended up pouring 3 pints for the price of a flight for my friend and I ended up just getting a pint, no complaints there. The beer selection was quite nice as to be expected for a spin off of Boulders on Broadway.  Being brand new, I expected some kinks needing to be worked out and there were a few. I got the grilled cheese for my meal, excellent sandwich but I had to send the fries back because they were barely cooked. They made up for it by quickly replacing them with extra crispy sweet potato fries. Next mishap? Charging for the 2nd flight we never got. They quickly corrected the problem and went beyond redemption by 1) buying me my pint and 2) giving me a coupon for a free pint next time I stop by. Minor annoyances and they are clearly moving in the right direction.   The food prices seem to be in line with a neighborhood grill. The beer prices seem a bit cheaper than you'd find at most places (especially for craft beer, $3.50 drafts for happy hour? hell yea). Finally, a craft beer spot in my neighborhood within walking distance. I'll be going back for sure.",

    "text": "Last night was my first time at Spokes. I had never heard of the place before but saw a couple in a local flyer and saw that they had 24 beers on tap!!! Sounded like a great place to me.  Be warned this place is not easy to find without any kind of GPS!! There are no signs for it anywhere and it cannot be seen from the street. Upon walking in we were told to seat ourselves anywhere we would like. We chose to be sit over by the bar which overlooked a beautiful patio area complete with a pond. We sat for quite some time before a waiter came over to us (about 10 min). They do have a good selection of beers (I chose the SanTan Hefeweizen) and food seemed to SOUND good. So I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.   The food literally took 40 minutes to get to us. Keep in mind this place was not busy at all. Our food was okay but nothing too impressive for the prices. I had asked for my burger medium rare and it was almost well done. The side of black beans and rice was bland and cold. At this point we were ready to leave but we had another 20 minute wait to get our check.  Overall this place could be good if they changed a few things. Great selection of beers but food is lacking. May give it another shot but doubt it.",

He explained the beer list well, offered tasters, and recommended a couple. We were not let down at all. They had approximately 25 beers on tap and a solid variety, including AZ breweries like Historic and Huss, so there is something for everyone.   The food menu was a pleasant surprise to see. I don't eat meat so that can be challenging but Spokes had a number of vegetarian options. I have to highly recommend the Poblano pepper stuffed with sweet potato mash and queso (I skipped the bacon). The sweetness of the potato really balanced the bite of the pepper. It was an absolute treat.   I'm happy to say we have found a new neighborhood pub to frequent after last night's visit.",

The restaurant is older as it used to be a sports bar called Sneakers but the decor is cute with all of the bike stuff. Bikes are allowed inside the restaurant and you can even lock them up! They even have some games like darts, etc. The menu wasn't huge but had a lot of different options. We learned that most of the foods were local and we will have to come back for their specialty, a roasted stuffed poblano pepper. We ordered their medium wings as an appetizer and they were your basic fried crispy hot wings but were delicious nonetheless. I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich with a gluten free bun and a side salad. Both were good! My boyfriend got a made to order burger with bacon and he thought it was great but a little pricey. The only thing we would change is to offer a lunch menu/discount on some of the food items during lunch time as a sandwich and burger for $10 is a little much but since we had to use our Groupon, we didn't mind. Also, the porch is dog-friendly and they offer an interesting brunch every Saturday and Sunday. Happy Hour Mon-Thursday!",

Good happy hour food and beer selections. Turkey tacos were good, on the lighter side and cheap! Happy hour food is $3.99 and $1 off beers. Also had chips & queso, my husband had hot wings that he said were tasty, but could have used a little more sauce. He also had the southwest turkey sandwich meal that he liked. Good grub for a local pub. The food was above average..maybe a 3.5.. But the service bumped up my review. Good food and prices, comfortable & clean environment topped off by great service.

    "text": "I've been to spokes many times. I like their food and their beer. But tonight I had the worst dining experience of my long life. There were eight people at our table, which is a little large and so I expected some delays. However... What we received was absurd. It took more than 10 minutes after we ordered water for it to arrive. Three of us ordered beers. Then we ordered our meals. About 20 minutes later one of the beers arrived. After another 15 minutes someone told another diner when he asked for his beer that they were out of that beer. I asked for my beer 4 different times.  It took approximately 50 minutes for someone who wasn't waiting on us to come tell me that they were out of that beer too. After three more requests I finally received a Coke instead. One of my dining companions, a vegetarian, ordered the cauliflower wings. When she got them there were chicken nuggets included in the wings. When she complained to the manager the manager told her that it was normal for chicken nuggets to be included with the cauliflower wings and she should've told them she didn't want the chicken. I call BS on that one. Another diner ordered one plate of cauliflower wings and one plate of boneless wings. She received the cauliflower wings but the chicken wings never came. When the manager was called she was accused of not placing the order. Then when the chicken wing order that they had requested was later brought it contained bone in wings when the diner had specifically ordered Boneless wings. The manager proceeded to argue with the diner over whether she had ordered boneless or bone in, rather than simply apologizing. When they brought their food I still hadn't received the beer I had ordered 45 minutes earlier. Nor did they bring silverware or napkins. I had to go to the kitchen to ask for some napkins because nobody came back to wait on us.  For the first time in my life I left the waitress a two cent tip. Although I feel kind of bad about this because it wasn't all her fault, it's the only way the customer has to express discontent with the service. Although she was nice and checked back on us once our food had arrived, for the first hour we sat there she only came back one time and didn't inquire or check to see that we gotten our drinks and I had to chase down other servers and wait staff do you again ask for my drink 4 different times. (When she asked what she could have done to make her service better, she said that she had given our table more attention that she had given any other table that night)   I likes spokes. I want them to do well. I plan to go back because I know anyone can have a bad night. But I'm writing this review because not only was the service bad but the manager on duty did not handle it .well. He never  apologized or acknowledged in any way that our service had been bad. He took three dollars off my check. He argued with us when we complained. And he basically treated me like I was a bitch for complaining.  The owner needs to know that if only the manager had tried to make things right, or handled it in a non-defiant non-defensive manner I would have left happier. I shouldn't be made to feel badly for complaining about such terrible service.  On the upside I really enjoyed seeing the sugar thieves at spokes.",

Yet our appetizer order was still omitted for some reason.  Our first selection of beer was also a bust, as the well worn paper beer list was not up to date.  My fish tacos were lacking to say the least. The fish was small and tasted like fried frozen fish sticks on old tortillas.  On another trip I got to try a few apps for happy hr. The Queso is nothing special with some franks red hot sauce on top. The coli-flour wings are just fried (not breaded) coli-flour with sauce and the nachos were quite weak with a sprinkling of cheese and some queso sauce and a dollop sour cream. A far cry from the nachos of my dreams from other local breweries.   This location has been a revolving door over the years each business lasts 2-4 years, I wonder how long spokes will last.",

If you're looking for a dark, romantic place, go watch a chick flick with your significant other.   However...if you like really good food in a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, with plenty of cold beer on tap, Spokes On Southern won't disappoint.   Recently moved into some office space right next door and Spokes has quickly become one of my favs. Angie, the daytime bartender, has quickly become a friend. In just a couple of visits, she knows me by name and brings me a cold Kiltlifter before I have to ask. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but what I have tried has been surprisingly good. The Turkey Quesadilla on the appetizer menu is more of a wrap than a quesadilla, it's fantastic- as is the stuffed Pablano. Both were recommended by Angie and she was right, very good. I also had the grilled steak burrito and thought it was great.   I gave 4 stars, rather than 5, only because I'm a cheapskate and wish everything was a dollar or two less expensive. But the great food and Angie are worth a few more bucks. I'll definitely be a regular here at Spokes.",

My boyfriend and I had about 3 different appetizers and a decent amount of beer (~8 or so) between the two of us over a 5 hour period. Our bill was just a little over $50. We tried the boneless hot wings, nachos and cauliflower wings (which were to die for) and enjoyed everything.

    "text": "I finally got to come here after hearing about it for awhile now and I'm NOT mad I did!  My bf had the fish tacos and said they were good! I ordered the turkey sliders off of the happy hour menu along with the \"boneless\" cauliflower wings and i can't stop thinking about either! I was super stoked to see they had a happy hour on a Saturday (when we stopped in for lunch).   Super cool atmosphere whether you want to grab lunch with co workers or go at night to this chill, neighborhood bar/restaurant. During the week they have Trivia and karaoke which is super cool and hope to be back soon for that.   I also love the outdoor patio that over looks the pond. Makes it have a more comfy-home feel which I really enjoy!  I can't wait to try the sister restaurants- boulders on broadway or southern!",

    "text": "I came here with a friend early on a Friday for lunch.  We got to pick our table since we were the only people here.  Chose a nice booth, although it was a little snug, but I liked the green light that it had. I ordered what I thought was a quesadilla, but it was really more of a wrap.  It was better than expected for bar food.  You can tell the food is fresh and cooked to order. Nothing looked like it came out of a box, which is great.  My friend had the chicken caesar salad which looked amazing as well.   The only drawbacks were that the place was hot.  I had to ask the server to turn the air cooler, there were flies bothering us the entire time and the service was slow. Other than that, it was conveniently located, in a beautiful little complex with a pond that had Koi, turtles and ducks.  When the weather cools off, I'll be back to sit outside!",

We were not the only people there, though was a lot of empty tables for a Friday evening.   I would describe the place as the local drinking spot for sure.   Has that vibe about it, the cool patio and all that.   Also the kind of place where the tables are sticky and they serve RC cola instead of Pepsi or coke.    But the food left a lot to be desired for us.   Wife ordered the nachos which were lacking in quality and quantity.  Would describe it as one layer of chips with a very un-natural orange cheese on top.  Was supposed to have pico and sour cream on top but didn't.    I got the carne asada tacos, which were small for the price, and the meat tasted lower quality and dry.  I don't know if it was the meat or something they put in the taco but the taste was just not right.    All in all, if you go here and you love it, power to you.   But to me and my wife, the food was overpriced and not great at all.  We would not return or recommend it.",

Our dog looked happy and cool so we went in. We sat inside by the window so we could keep an eye on him.  The patio was completely empty and inside were only 3 tables of patrons. We ordered our food and were waiting for about ten minutes when a scraggly unkempt guy came over and told us we couldn't have our dog outside.  It was a \"liability\".  When we told him we had been given permission and had already ordered he said he hadn't even started our order, so we were still free to leave.  It was almost like the Chris Elliott looking guy didn't want us there. It was a very weird experience and we left pretty upset. Wouldn't go back if they paid me.",

Got the menu and it goes from sandwiches and hamburgers to what they call southwest-ish meals. Noticed right away how veg friendly they are. Me and my lunch friend decided to do the tacos: him, the carne asada tacos on flour tortilla and I got the veggie tacos. They offer many sides to your meal even include the soup of the day. Today was vegetarian chili!! ANOTHER WOW! I asked the server about the soup and I guess the chef's here are quite the \"soup-ies\" and create something new almost daily. After eating the chili I would tell everyone to ask what the Soup of the Day is! I bet you will never go wrong. Both our meals were great, service was great and peaceful pond view made this a perfect lunch!  Check out Spokes! Try the soup!",

Also love the French fries dipped in wing sauce and ranch.  The mini sliders were a bit dry.  I like watching hockey and volleyball on the TV's.

We went during their grand opening week and were seated right by two roll up doors even after telling the hostess we didn't want to sit outside (it was quite cold that evening) so we had to ask the server later to close the doors for us. Queso dip appetizer was probably the most boring I've ever had. Food took forever, my burger was simply meh. My wife's tacos were seasoned with a crazy amount of some oily concoction and the meat was tough and chewy. I had to send my cold fries back.   We waited a couple weeks to let them settle in and didn't have much better luck. This time the server was indifferent bordering in rude. I had pulled turkey sliders (seasoned with barbecue sauce and curry?!?!?!) on a soggy pretzel bun and my wife got the mediocre burger.   Beer selection is great and will probably keep me coming back occasionally for some late night libations. I wouldn't mess with anything else. It's sad/scary when I think I could legitimately do a better job cooking/coming up with the menu.",

    "text": "Had a great early dinner with my husband at Spokes. We're long time Tempe residents so have seen this establishment be many a restaurant. Am so hopeful Spokes will make it!!! When we arrived around 4:30pm, a sign alerted us to go to the bar for seating. My husband likes to sit in the bar (I'm OK with that, too) so we found our own table. I love the atmosphere in Spokes (as it was when it was Streets of New York and Uptown Brewery)... open area bar, outdoor seating. So, where we situated ourselves was great!   Didn't take long for our waiter, Max, to address us with a beer list (different than what was on their web site that day). He helped me select a beer that I absolutely enjoyed, as did my husband. Beers were great.  Food: We ordered to split a kale salad and the sirloin sliders. The kale salad was fairly standard in that it is a bitter green dressed-up with a blue cheese dressing (although for my tastes could have had even more of that dressing), pecans, strawberries served around the salad (would like better mixed within the salad). The best thing... the whole salad sat on a balsamic dressing. This dressing really helped cut the bitterness of the kale. So, only change... slice up the strawberries into the salad, add a bit more of the blue-cheese dressing (or offer on the side). Keep that balsamic dressing-so, so good!!! We took home half of the salad.  Sirloin sliders: A lot of places offer 3 sliders. Spokes gave 2. My husband and I didn't go for these right away- ate the salad, and munched on the delicious sweet potato fries that we ordered as a side with the sliders. So, perhaps if we had, they would have been warmer (hotter) to the palate. While there is a pecan pesto, it was lost on the sliders... pretzel bun was great... would like to have had some kind of dipping sauce or sauce on the slider that might be a horseradish/mayo variety... perhaps something the diner could control. The sirloin was tender...great... Needless to say, we ate both!!!  Our side of sweet potato fries was right on!!! These were crisp, hot, and meaty. None were left on the plate!!!   When ordering, we told Max that we were splitting the two orders, so would have appreciated that the food came out split on two plates. Not so. Max was observant and gave us smaller plates for us to do ourselves. Not a biggie, but one of those nice touches that diners appreciate.  Service: Can't say enough how Max was attentive and observant of our needs as diners. We also were eager to chat with Max, and he was able to do so as the early time we were there. The kind of people hired to represent a business matters... we hope to return to Spokes and request Max's area for seating... usually a Thursday through Sunday opportunity!  I look forward to returning. Max recommends the turkey quesadilla and the Carver burger which I will order!!!! For those who might not know, Spokes is a sister restaurant to Boulders on Broadway...",

They have a huge beer selection that always offers variety.  CONs Their beer selection is constantly changing.  I'm a creature of habit so it's frustrating when I find a beer that I really like they don't offer that beer the next time I'm there,  I think it would be nice if they had a few regular beer selections.  The food is pretty expensive for the portion size.   Our server had a really bad attitude.  Each time I came to the restaurant I sat on the patio and the server always seemed to be in a bad mood.  I understand that serving is not an easy job and everyone has a bad day every now and then but its a bummer to have the server consistently be in a bad mood.",

Now I can feel much better about my choice to go out and have a tasty burger!!  You add that their food is really inexpensively priced, they have indoor bike parking and their patio is dog friendly....I'm not going anywhere else for great pub food.   Also their staff were all fun to talk to.  So glad I tried them.  Hats off to Matt (our server) who was great to talk to and seemed like a sincerely nice guy.  We'll be back as often as we can!",

    "text": "I've been to Spokes twice now & haven't had a glimpse of disappointment!   They have 24 beers on tap- and a great informational beer list to match (in case you like to know exactly what you are ordering.) I love beer but I also like surprises. Both times I've been I have had super friendly & knowledgable servers who have helped me choose random beers that would please my palette. There is definitely a beer for everyone... who likes beer. We took my anti-beer best friend and explained her situation as she looked over the menu- immediately, they brought her a couple of samples hoping to find one she liked. When she wasn't pleased with any of them (crazy girl) they brought her a fun & creative tequila drink. It was very sweet!  We decided we were hungry and thought we would give their affordable food a try. I was surprised by some of the poor food reviews, because everything we had was very flavorful, well made, and unique! (It is still a new restaurant, so you have to give them some room to work out the kinks- but I think they are doing well & are open to hearing customer opinions.) I had the sirloin tacos with a side salad. The balsamic dressing was delicious and my salad was super fresh. When my two tacos came out, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food.. but they were packed full of goodness! They came with chimchurri and poblano peppers, and they weren't spicy- but moist and full of flavor! My light eating friend ordered edamame, and was given the choice of having it served salted or with pesto. Yum! My other friend got the Caprese sandwich and sweet potato fries, both of which she was very pleased with.   The decor and atmosphere inside are cute. It's bike themed with an at home, neighborhood bar feel. Outside is adorable! Especially with the great weather we are currently having :). It's covered, well lit, and overlooks a little baby lake I didn't even know was there. Also, they have happy hour all day on Saturdays- so who can go wrong with that? We enjoyed our Saturday evening there.  I had 2 craft beers I'd never tried before and plenty of food & my tab was only $17. The service was quick, down to earth, and full of jokes for our increasingly silly table.   Give Spokes a try- unless you hate beer and friendly faces you won't be disappointed. :)",

The waiter was well-versed in all the beers on tap and can help out with any questions. I wasn't impressed with the menu, but there is a little something for everyone. I got the turkey on ciabatta and it was good, though nothing great.   All in all this is a nice place to grab a drink, eat a little food, and converse with friends. i would not seek it out in any way nor do I see it becoming a go-to spot, but it is a good option if you are in the area.",

There was a little mix up with whose table we were, but the server we ended up with was awesome.   The draft list is better than average and there are a ton of vegetarian options on the menu. We got the cauliflower hot wings, the ultimate burger, and a kid's quesadilla. I loved the cauliflower wings. The sauce was perfect. The burger was solid.   The best part of Spokes is it has a great neighborhood vibe. Our kid saw a kid about her age and they went over to this area with couches and toys and games and played while the grown ups ate. It was kind of perfect.  I think we've found our new neighborhood go to.",

Nothing sounded that appetizing so we settled on fries only.  Mind you I live nearby and tried this place a few years ago and haven't been back since but there was a Groupon so I thought what the hell?     During the rest of the night, I thought what the hell twice more but for very different reasons.   First off, after ordering drinks and some fries, we saw a very large cockroach crawling down the walls toward our feet.  Then upon moving to another table another large uninvited bug tried to come join.  What the hell? You can't afford to spray for roaches every so often?    The second what the hell moment happened after we decided that we should just sit inside despite the beautiful weather.   Upon walking in, my nose was filled with regret as I sniffed a large whiff of puke. It was so pungent you couldn't breathe.  There was no visible puke just a horrid puke smell at the bar.  What the hell??  It's a shame because I live so close!  New menu, bug spray, and cleaner is what this place needs!",

The bartender comped me one to assist with my misery at being skipped over numerous times at my table. I do not blame the waitress, it was too much for any single person. I blame the boss man for setting her up to fail. The food was okay, when it eventually showed up about an hour later.  There were kids running all over the place, I did not see the parents of many of the said children. They were literally wrecking the place.

    "text": "I was disappointed to have a (less than) mediocre experience at Spokes On Southern after reading a lot of great reviews on it. We decided to try it out on a Saturday afternoon because the weather was gorgeous and we wanted to sit outside - Spokes' patio area is rather plain, but overlooks a nice little lake with some very social turtles and ducks. We sat ourselves (per the instructions on the welcome sign) and waited several minutes before a server greeted us.   Saturdays have an \"all-day happy hour\" special, so we ordered a soft pretzel with queso from the happy hour menu. It took quite a while to arrive at our table (10+ minutes after we put our entree orders in), and I was pretty disappointed when it arrived. It looked and tasted like one of the frozen pretzels you buy from the grocery store, and the queso was rubbery. I think it was $5, so you get what you pay for, I guess...but it wasn't even worth that.   Our entrees were also underwhelming - I had the fish tacos, which had no taste. The flour tortillas seemed stale and powdery, and the fish tasted like it had been microwaved from frozen. My boyfriend had the Carver burger, which he said had little flavor, as well. We both had fries (I had regular waffle fries, he had sweet potato fries), and they were decent. However, the table behind us ordered a side of fries and we overheard them tell the server that they had arrived cold. Hmm...  Overall, Spokes seems like a better place to grab drinks and bar food than to enjoy a meal - I saw on their website that they have a trivia night, so maybe I'll try it again for one of those events.",

Love that there's a small lake and ducks milling around, there were also pigeons flying above which could be startling at times.  I've been here once before and sat inside which was fine, but sitting outside was great save for all the cigarette smoke. I ordered cauliflower wings from their happy hour menu, which are lightly fried and come with your choice of dressing (ranch or blue cheese) and wing sauce, and I picked hot. They were good, just wish they were hotter in temperature. And they only came with one carrot stick and two celery stalks, lol.   Service was good and attentive, and we enjoyed our time here.",

The reason I was here for lunch was because of a meetup I had with a potential contact, as I am looking for new career opportunities.  I deferred to his choice, when he asked me.    I had the VEG HEAD SANDWICH with some waffle fries, and a glass of water.  This being a professional meeting, I chose not to partake of any alcoholic beverages (I also do not drink alcohol by my personal choice).    My sandwich was good, and the waffle fries were crisp.  The quality of the food was good.    I do not know though if I would come back, simply because it is not my kind of restaurant.  I tend to enjoy things a bit more ethnic, and perhaps a bit more unique, then the standard fare.    However, this being more of a professional venue for me, I did find the place quite good.  I wish them well.",

Every freaking time. Yesterday we went with our family from out of town, it was pretty embarrassing. Not enough waters were brought out for the table, no cream came with the coffee, chicken and waffles were toddler-size portion, we got the wrong filling in one of our breakfast burritos, and our server had to be hunted down to get a refill on coffee. I want the restaurants in Tempe to be great. I hope this place improves its service, the food gets better and becomes a little less sloppy overall. Because I really love that duck pond and I want to eat delicious food and have basic service while I sit next to it.",

I tried the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, bbq hot wings, and the salted caramel creme puff. The sweet potato fries were perfect - which isn't always the case in restraunts since the sweet potato fad hit - and the hot wings were also very good. The grilled cheese was super tasty and I chose avacado and bacon as my two topping selections along with a base blend of cheeses. The only thing that bummed me out was that the dessert was prepackaged - the server explained that they were running out of them because the supplier discontinued that dessert - but this isn't Applebees, so I expected the desserts to be made fresh! Very disappointing.  They had a lot of turkey-based items (tacos?!) which I found pretty unique.",

I was in town visiting with a friend and after only 2 hours of relaxing on the patio and having a couple drinks, we were told that we were not allowed to continue to drink. The company I was with are all responsible young adults and did not disrupt anyone or cause any sort of trouble. I was extremely disappointed because the food and waitress were very good throughout the evening until this all happened with the bartender (who had not even spoken to us) and the manager (who did nothing to investigate why we were asked to no longer eat or drink) overall, I would not recommend going to a restaurant like this.

Also  he noticeably respected when to stop let you enjoy your drink very diligently .   I was not there for Happy Hour but will be returning to take advantage of it soon. drinks look fair and have great food options. The beer was very great but all my compliments have to again to the bartender, David.   I am constantly disappointed by other bars and restaurants because their staff cannot make a near decent 'Old Fashioned' spirit.  I must be honest and say that Spokes' bartender made the absolute best 'Old Fashion' since my very first. It is amazing that they have this type of talent on staff.  The food I had was also very enjoyable.   Overall vibe was very positive, chill and friendly. I look forward to the summer because it looks like they have a great patio.  Probably the best first impression of a new restaurant that I have had in quite some time. Fair Prices and amazing atmosphere.",

The 2nd time I went here to see an old college friend.  I'm not a drinker but it seemed like this place was pretty relaxed. There's plenty of spaces to sit/lounge and it's not really crowded. It's like the place that people go to either hangout out with their friends or have a drink after work. There's karaoke but the its mostly people with horrible drunken voices getting on the mic. It's pretty laid back and somewhat \"friend-ish\" (as opposed to friendly) bc there isn't a meat market kind of vibe, but people just don't talk to strangers with ease. It seems like the beers are cheap and the bartenders are like \"whatever\" in attitude so that's a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for. I think the beers were like $4 or $5 during happy hour or reverse happy hour, or whatever. Me, I'm a \"whatever\" kind of person too, so I this place is fine with me.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Boulders on Broadway, so when the manager mentioned that Spokes is the same owner, I wanted to check it out. The food was really great with more things on the menu I hope to go back and try soon. I thought it might be a carbon copy of Boulders, but the selections were different, but maintained the focus on upping the ante for bar food.   The servers were so friendly! On a slow night - there was some improv think going on in another part of the very large space - they chatted with us, welcoming us as our first time at the bar. Happy hour was $1 off all drinks, not amazing but they said perhaps food specials are in the works, but for the friendly service, good food and super convenient location, I'll be back!",

We were there for over two hours just to eat dinner.  It took 20 minutes for my friend to get a bloody mary (she got it after she finally asked where it was), and my boyfriend spent a good 15 minutes waiting for a soda refill (after he had asked twice)  It took over an hour for us to get our food.  Two of my friends ordered the 10 piece wings, but when the food came out, one plate had 6 on it and the other had 7?  What was going on in the kitchen? We would've spent more time there and ordered more drinks, but the service was so slow that we were afraid we'd be stuck there for another two or three hours and we had somewhere else to be.  It wasn't busy at all in there either, so I'm not sure what the holdup was.",

The food was outstanding, good beer selection and Matt did a great job bartending, waiting tables and keeping a touch on all his customers. The kid zone is a nice idea for families to be able to being their kids and still have a little buffer while being able to keep an eye on them. One drawback of this is if you are sitting near the kids area it can be loud as hell and if you're not a fan of kids very annoying. All in all a very good experience and will return to try the weekend brunch in the near future.",

    "text": "I heard about Spokes from a friend, and the fact that it is related to Boulders made me want to try it even more! I came here with my man to watch a Lakers-Suns game and it was a good overall experience.  The bartender was nice enough to find the game we wanted and made sure the tvs facing us had it on. Our waitress was also very nice and very helpful with beer and food selection. I was feeling adventurous and chose their pepper burger over an easy bacon cheeseburger. It had different peppers and tzatziki on it and it was a unique and fairly good choice. I would like to try something different next time, but it wasn't bad. The thing I loved most was their tomato bisque, it was rich and tasty, I was very surprised at how good it was considering my low expectations of soup at a bar. I tried some of Eric's sirloin tacos and they were pretty good. I want to come back and check out that lake view and try other items on their menu.",

If your looking for something new and unique then you'll probably be delighted. If your looking for the usually staples, made well and tasty you might find yourself having a hard time making a decision. All choices seem normal until you read what they add. Seems like they are trying a little too hard to be different, which really isn't needed for a sport bar type spot. Ended up getting hot wings and a Cesar salad.  The salad had to be modified from the menu, just an example of how they might be trying a little too hard to be unique. Shouldn't have to modify a simple Cesar salad, at least I can't remember the last time I had to do that anywhere else. Probably won't go back, just because I don't want to have to special order everything I eat if I'm not feeling adventurous.",

The breakfast nachos consisted of a tiny portion of soggy waffle fries drowning in a bright orange cheese sauce and specked with miniature bits of egg and bacon. 0/5.  The kale salad was overdressed but tasty. Tiny portion for $9.79, way overpriced. 2/5.  The poblano pepper stuffed with sweet potato and covered in the same bright orange cheese sauce mentioned earlier was good, as promised in all the other reviews. 4/5.

    "text": "In Tempe, people don't go to biker bars, they go to bicycle bars. : )  Spokes serves up fresh, slightly healthier versions of your typical bar foods for a reasonable price (Less than $10).  They also offer more vegetarian options.  This is the 3rd day since their opening, and it was decently busy for a Thursday night.  The interior is pretty nice, and has various bicycle-themed accoutrements, such as a pair of silver owls made out of bicycle parts.  The bar and dining area is very spacious, and TVs line the walls.  There is a patio area which overlooks the gorgeous lake area outside, which I will definitely have to take advantage of once the weather is nicer!  They offer a wide range of beers available (20+ on the menu), as well as iced tea and soda.  A nice thing about their iced tea is they offer Stevia in their sweetener baskets.    Once we were seated, we were handed menus.  Despite it being just their third day since the grand opening, my menu was already splattered, sticky, and had a large tear on the side.  Putting aside my distaste at the sad state of my menu, I opted for the veg-head sandwich, while my husband had the carver burger.  The veg-head sandwich was decent.  It had fresh vegetables such as red bell pepper and eggplant in it, as well as fresh basil and mozzarella.  It had a sweet balsamic vinegar sauce with it.  As a whole, it did taste a little bland (Maybe it needed some more of the balsamic?) and the eggplant was tough and bitter.  I tried the carver burger, which I liked a lot better.  It was a sizable meal, with juicy, perfectly cooked to order meat, and very flavorful ingredients. The only real negative for my husband was that he felt the burger needed some more seasoning to bring out the flavor of the beef more. We both had sweet potato fries as a side, although you can also get sides such as salad, soup, or waffle fries with your order.  The sweet potato fries were awesome.  They were light, crispy, with just the right amount of seasoning.  Service was fast and friendly, and the owner came by to chat for a little bit, which I appreciated.  They offer happy hour and a reverse happy hour, and are open late until 2 A.M.    Overall, a pretty good experience here at a nice restaurant and location.",

    "text": "My guy and I tried this restaurant last year and were quite unimpressed with the service and food,  but after I read more positive reviews recently we decided to give it another try as we wanted to enjoy dining at an outdoor patio due to the weather finally cooling off.  There were only 4-5 people on the patio (and not that busy inside either), but still it took quite a while for a server to come to our table (choice of wooden picnic table/benches or table with hard metal chairs but we chose the chairs since at least they have a back on them).  We ordered and then waited at least 20 minutes before we saw the server again which was frustrating because I wanted to order some wine.  The server was pleasant so I didn't want to fuss but he should have been able to answer my question about what kind of red wine they offered.  He said he would go back to the bar to ask, but I said \"That's OK, I'll just have whatever kind of Cabernet you have.\" If I let him leave again there was no telling when he'd return and then I'd need to wait even longer for him to go back and get the wine for me.  The stuffed poblano wasn't good - very odd - and we only ate the actual pepper because the stuffing was yucky.  The hummus platter was also strange - odd tasting hummus with some kind of white cheese sprinkled on it, and it was served with white bread vs. pita or nice crackers of some kind, and the celery & carrots were dry and old. The so called bruschetta brought us more white bread (not toasted), and was decent but nothing I would order again.  The patio has no ambiance itself, but at least if you sit near the edge of the water you get a decent view of it as well as a bunch of ducks.  'Last time for us to give this place another chance.",

It seems as though the owner doesnt care, because there are a few reviews here about bad service.... oh well what can you do except give a explanation of how busy you were....  Busy enough to not care what people write on Yelp.  As a business owner myself, I would never let a bad review go unnoticed.  I would never recommend this place even if the food is good.",

    "text": "I can't get over how rad this place is. From the top down, this place offers an exceptional drinking and dining experience.   Spokes features well over twenty taps of rotating beers from around the country (though most are from the west/southwest). A not insignificant number of taps feature local brews, including beers from Four Peaks. If you like beer and enjoy sampling a lot of different brews, you will LOVE Spokes.   I would love Spokes just for the beer, but their food is even better. If you've never dined here before, you need to start with the grilled cheese. They start with a robust blend of cheeses and allow you to customize it with nearly fifteen different fillings ranging from bacon and tomato to pear and basil. I have never had a better grilled cheese from a restaurant before. My boyfriend fills his with tomato and avocado, while I usually opt for pear, basil, and onion (and sometimes I get adventurous with jalapeno, which they freshly slice in the kitchen). Served with a healthy helping of the most delicious waffle fries, this all-American classic will delight your tastebuds.   Desserts aren't on their menu, but the chef writes them out on a chalkboard on the dining room. There's an area for your little ones, karaoke starting at 9 on Tuesdays, trivia on Mondays, and a super chill vibe every day. The patio overlooks the lake and is dog-friendly.   Ultimately, a bar with great beer and fabulous food is nothing without great customer service. Dave and Scott are two of the bartenders here, and they are some of the best in the business. They clearly love their jobs, and it's fun to chat with them about beer (or anything, really). They're honest about what they like and dislike and are always good for a recommendation if you're not sure what beer to order.  If you're looking for a fab place to hang, drink delicious beer, and get a great meal, look no further than Spokes. You won't be disappointed.",

I liked the service we got, the bar was nice and clean, they had a really inviting patio area, but the TV's were WAY too loud. It was during a football playoff game, but they were so loud we were yelling at each other across our high top in the bar.   The food was decent, it wasn't terrible just decent. The beer selection was sub par - not sure if it was just that it was the winter season, but they mostly had micro brews that were all darker in color (ambers, IPA's, porters, stouts) and didn't have a good selection of Lager's or Pilsner's to choose from. I ended up with my trusty old Stella Artois that never disappoints.   With so many places in the Phoenix area, I will most likely be checking out someplace else next time we go out.",

Tucked away in a strip mall (it IS Tempe...) is a gorgeous place, right next to a little pond that even has ducks that wander around. Who knew?  I'm a card carrying beer snob and this place doesn't disappoint.  Their extensive beer menu feature a wide variety of beers both local and not that would suit any taste. I even experienced a new beer. That is hard to do.  In addition to a wonderful beer menu, the food is fantastic.  We started with the stuffed poblano.  A poblano stuffed with sweet potato and beer cheese.  need I say more?    I then ordered the grilled cheese. This was amazing.  Sourdough buttered bread with four cheeses perfectly melted.  What makes this grilled cheese sammich so much more is the fact that you can order options. Options?  Tomato, onion, prosciutto, avocado, basil , sun dried tomatoes. it's a stellar sandwich and well worth the calories!  My friends dishes were also amazing and I can also highly recommend the Spokes Burger. This is a fresh, not pre pressed burger with a ton of flavor.    Bike friendly bar, tons of spots for bikes.  They also have a huge patio as well as a spacious indoor area with tons of televisions.",

We understood it was a Sunday and there was a chance they would be reasonably busy. Someone who worked there opened the door for us and exclaimed if we planned on ordering food it would take over 2 hours. When we said we would be ok sitting on the patio they said \"well there's like 100 people out there but I guess you can test your luck\".  Not sure if they were just overwhelmed or what but they were so unwelcoming.   We did check the patio and there was maybe 35-40 people out there.   Overall pretty disappointed with our customer service experience and we didn't even eat there, which leads me what they treat paying patrons like.",

You get 3 cheeses on the grilled cheese if I remember correctly there are 3 base cheeses. I remember there is cheddar and blue cheese.  Then you get to pick 2 extra toppings from a very delicious list.  I chose bacon and sweet onions...it's was absolute perfection! I got the sweet potato fries, they were good but a little soft, next time I plan on trying the waffle fries.  For an appetizer we got the beer queso spicy style and it was soooo gooooddd.  It's been a long time since I've had good queso and this one was delicious!  The wait staff was really nice, explained things and were passionate about the things being served.",

    "text": "Yikes! We ordered well done wings and they came out rubbery so we reordered.  One of meals came out about 7 minutes before the rest of ours and the wings still hadn't arrived from reordering. Finally the waiter came back and said he didn't know what the delay was on the wings so he took them off the bill and he would still bring them to us if they cooked them.  The waiter was nice about the issues but it doesn't dismiss the major issues with the kitchen. Our other three meals arrived and two out of three burgers were under cooked, seriously under cooked. The manager ended up coming out and we told him about the burgers being undercooked and he did offer to take half the cost off, which was nice but still very frustrating. The wings came out and they looked exactly the same as the first time, nice and rubbery.  We tried to try and salvage the meal so we decided to order dessert, a house made brownie and salted caramel cheesecake, however, after placing the order, we were told they were out of two out of four of the desserts they offer. Really??? I'm done, we won't be back!",

They say it's because of the alcohol content...which isn't True...and they know it...or they should know it!! As a matter of fact just last night they pulled that BS on me and she said...\" Sir, anything with 8% or higher ABV is poured in 10 oz glass.\" I said well that beers not 8%....when she checked (because of course I'm wrong) she came back and said, \"well it's a really rare keg and it's about profitability\"....yeah. That's what I thought...$5.85 for a 10 oz Oskar Blues IPA...too expensive. You'd think a place owned by the owner of Boulders would be a great place too...but as they are quick to point out \"this isn't Boulders...\" To which I easily reply \"you're damn right it's not!\" The food is just ok...the wait staff is hit and miss",

My slider had a hair in it. I informed the server (who was very nice) and he sent my food back. I kept my fries so I could have something to eat while my friend ate. I waited for my food, and I kid you not, I waited 45 minutes for them to be delivered. They would have been ready before then but they got taken to the wrong table. My server kept checking back to see if I had my food... Nope. But he didn't seem to have the sense of urgency to get my food out to me, especially having it take that long. He took my fries away and said he would bring me fresh ones with my sliders... Okay. Finally, my sliders came out, but with the wrong type of fries. They really couldn't get this food out to me correctly... There was no rush to make sure I had my food, and my friend was long since finished with his food before I FINALLY got mine. The server comped my food and drink which was nice, but the fact I had to wait that long, for sliders, and the fact that I had my fries taken away and replaced with the wrong ones, was definitely a joke. Will not eat here again. Might come back for a drink though (maybe).",

My friend was on his phone reading off beers, and I was interested. The Entire Beer Menu and Food Menu are built into an APP? WHAT!!!! I was able to browse my phone right quick and know all about the best drafts on tap, and take a good look at the menu before the waitress comes to get my order.  It was really interesting. I ordered a San Tan Mr. Pineapple Beer, (very Taste, Much Pine, WOW) and some turkey tacos. I thought it sounded a little weird, but I'm a chef so I figured i can put Thanksgiving in a burrito, Tacos are a great choice. I grabbed some BBQ wings as well, the Happy Hour food here is really cheap but pretty good. Now this is my new local bar, it's right down there street, and the app even lets me know when my favorite beers are back on tap. AMERICA",

The food was disgusting as well. The steak burrito was more of an Indian, as in curry, flavored burrito than southwest, the burgers were burnt and disgustingly bland even with all the toppings (honestly have they not heard of salt?!?!?), and the pork sliders tasted like the Lloyds pulled pork from the tub from walmart. Thats not even mentioning the size of portions... All bun, no meat. Horrible experience and not worth the price given we couldn't eat anything... You know it's bad when you go to another restaurant right after...",
