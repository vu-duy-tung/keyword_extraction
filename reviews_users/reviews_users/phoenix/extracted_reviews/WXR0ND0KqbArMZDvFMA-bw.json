The staff is friendly and attentive. The burger I ordered was the Llano Burger medium rare and it was a good burger and the fries were good too.  However, the $15+ dollars that this meal cost leads me to not recommend it to serious burger lovers or even casual diners as you can find a better burger nearby (Shakeshack or Rally's depending on taste) and are really paying for the ambiance.",

Why would I tip a server who literally does nothing? All the food even the salad is served on a metal tray. Ugh it is not a flattering presentation. When i cut into my burger I get pieces of paper along with it that they use to cover the tray. Why is that there? Are the trays unsanitary? The service is horrible because no one knows whats going on. Everything is confusing. I know I won't be eating there again. Save a few bucks and time by just going to smashburger. Counter order, specialty burgers, pick your own table, they bring your food, no tipping. Simple delicious priced right. It's really not that hard! Hopdoddy Epic Fail for overpriced food and bad service.",

The set up is awkward: you are seated at a table, walk up to put in your order, serve yourself a drink and get your condiments (they don't have access regular ketchup m, you have to ask for it in tiny cups which is very weird considering it is a burger joint...) and then the \"server\" delivers ur burger and checks up on you. Just doesn't make sense. Also, the ingredients were fresh but I wasn't impressed with the taste of anything. It all seemed watery and flavorless. The sauces, the burger, everything. I ordered the classic burger. I probably won't be going back. It was very pricey also.",

The patties are fresh, and delicious, definitely can taste the difference. The combinations are different. I got the prime burger which I did forget what kind of beef it was, but it had carmelized onions, a Chipotle mayo, and basil. I didn't care for the basil, but the flavor combination was good. My fiancee got the buffalo burger which she really liked. We split a large fry, which they are to die for, fresh hand cut. To drink I got the black cherry hard lemonade, and my fiancee got the Lil prick, which was the prickly pear martini. I liked the martini over the lemonade. Then for dessert we split a oreo milkshake. It was amazing. They put cinnamon in the vanilla ice cream, which the combination taste amazing. The only problem I had us that is we got our food before our drinks.",

However, in the last year or so, the service has gradually declined with last night being the nail in the coffin for me. I went with a group of people and one ordered a beer. We watched it sit on the bar counter for 10 minutes, watching staff pass by it time and time again. Finally, my friend just went up and asked if we could take our beer. We ordered fries to come out with our burgers and the MANAGER delivered our fries to the wrong table. Once we notified staff that this happened, there was no apology or anything. We finished our burgers before the replacement fries even came out. The manager never reappeared while the remaining floor staff seemed blissfully unaware there were customers in the restaurant, opting to sit in a corner booth and chat with each other. The food is great but it's not worth going to with service like that.",

Then a tall server with nose rings came with our orders to go in two bags. He READ the order out from the receipt correctly and handed them to us.  I checked my bag once I walked out and of course food was missing from the order! Wow, after reading it??? He's like oh sorry! That's what happens when you don't do things yourself..\" Then when he brought the rest of my order, the truffle fries were cold and hard.

Drinks - good beer/bar menu, but we had the ginger lemonade - heavy on the ginger.  His Burger - LLano Poblano - fresh, flavorful, cooked to perfection, seasoned well, a bit on the spicy side but not over the top. SO yummy.  Her Burger - Greek Lamb - Raw. Not rare, but Raw. Inedible. Completely inedible.   My take - I'd return here for all the reasons you'd think. But.... I'd be sure to get my burger cooked through. I'd love to savor some of the flavor of His great burger in a lamb patty.   Why didn't I return my burger? Too crowded right at high noon, not willing to wait for a redo. Why do I even mention it?

    "text": "Hopdoddy the restaurant is immediately inviting  and everthing looks clean & new. The stars are for the food. Negatives is the weird 1-2-3 walk through.    When you first walk in  there is a bar in the middle of the restaurant. A hostess greets you & invites you to order at the counter on the side. After ordering then you walk to an assigned table. When ordering our items sometimes the servers were disorganized despite being friendly.   A manager helped us decide what burgers to get. I ordered the Good Cause burger that donates a $1 to a non-profit. All the burgers are organic, hormone free can you say hipster? There is a vegan option on the menu that my friend enjoyed with a multi-grain bun and avocado.  Overall, I enjoyed my burger you are paying for quality  here. But the major standout was the parmesan fries a MUST order here. Next time, i will order their shakes they look like retro american shakes.    Outside there is a nice patio that you can eat lunch and bring your dog, they even have dog treats.  It will be a nice hangout place in the fall.",

If you like gluten free options, grass fed beef, high quality ingredients made on site such as their ketchup/mustard/BBQ sauces this place is for you!  The green chile burger is my favorite stacked high grass fed beef patties cooked to your liking, spread on a potato bun, and paired with a cold DOS XX it was just what my hangover needed!    If you go during happy hour they knock off a few bucks on drinks, drafts, and burgers highly recommend.",

At about 5:40 she got slammed and she kept her kindness to every guest and was crushin it with all the drinks orders.   The female server with short hair was awesome and noticed the drinks were taking a while and the line got really long, she got samplers if the shake and passed then out to guests. What a great thing to do, and good marketing ;)  Again Kristen provided great service and truly made it a great last quick bite to eat.   Recommendation: prickly pear margarita with muddled jalapenos, delicious!   Will miss hopdoddy when I move, but highly recommend. Burgers are always top quality and taste amazing!",

    "text": "Why anyone in their right mind looked at this neighborhood and said, \"You know what we need? Another burger place!\" is beyond me. \"Premium\" burger bars have been rapidly growing in popularity this last decade to the point where I've found that the food, vibe, and slightly inflated prices all kind of blend in together. It's very difficult to tell one apart from the other, especially since they all seem to be located within a five mile radius.    In some ways, Hopdoddy seems to be following a checklist of what is required to run a modern restaurant that appeals to millennials. It's been proven many times that people are willing to pay higher prices for their food - just so long as they know where it's coming from. Throw in some slightly obscure sodas, a bar, some Sriracha sauce, and slogans laced with sexual innuendos, and you pretty much have your demographic covered!  I'm not a big fan of their ordering system. We were about to go inside, until I was told to \"step back\" and wait in line by some kind of bouncer-type dude. It was very weird. When we were granted permission to go inside, we were able to sample their Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake. As another reviewer noted, if there's actual Nutella inside it, we sure as hell couldn't taste it. I quickly changed my mind about ordering it as a dessert.  You order your food at the counter, they assign you a table (and a server), but you're still required to go fill your drink, grab your sauces, and stock your essentials. You also have to cut through the line in order to do this, which is probably the result of a poorly designed setup. I have no problem with \"do it yourself\" places, but I'm not sure why they still expect a tip when you've done most of the work yourself.     However, I'll give credit where credit is due. Hopdoddy actually has very good burgers! My girlfriend and I were both impressed with the quality of the beef on our classics. But, at the same time, it's not as if this was something I haven't experienced many times before. After all, it's not as if good burgers are scarce in Phoenix.  If you're familiar with the Smashfries at Smashburger, you'll get a pretty good idea of what their fries taste like. The green chili queso is embarrassingly overpriced, as it's essentially just broccoli and cheese soup similar to what McDonalds occasionally sells. It's not worth the cost, in my opinion.  For dessert, my girlfriend and I split a chocolate stout with Oreo. I'd compare it to a weakened horchata that's more milky than chocolately. We weren't really impressed.  Overall, I'd still give them a decent rating, because their burgers were excellent. But at the same time, there are so many places around here that serve burgers that are of equal quality, that I feel this place is only further over-saturating a neighborhood that has far too many identical establishments.  We'll probably return at some point, as I'm interested in trying some of their other offerings. If you like burgers, I'm sure it'll hit the spot. Just don't expect to get anything that you can't find by going to the fifty other places that offer a duplicate concept.",

With all of that said the Impossible Burger is amazing and I love that they offer the Maine Root sodas on tap.",

    "text": "We've been here twice.  The first time was amazing!  A busy Friday night... Great service and the burgers were excellent.  I got something with chili on it--way out of the norm for me--but it was really good.  My husband got the jalapeno and habanero burger and was sweating bullets (apparently that's the desired outcome).  Second time was a different story.  Weather was great so we opted to sit outside.  Before our drinks arrived we switched to a different table because the wind had picked up and our daughter was working on homework while we waited for the food to arrive.  Husband ran inside to let the staff know.  They gave us a new number and said it wouldn't be a problem.  Three different people came over to express confusion about us switching tables, our food was delivered, minus one item (a large fry to split among the family).  After that we never heard from or saw another person who worked there.  It was absolutely nuts.  We were the only ones on the patio at that point and were apparently completely forgotten about--as was our large fry.  We actually had to go inside and find someone to get the bill (a good twenty minutes after we had finished eating).  The sweet but clearly overwhelmed server apologized profusely and offered to have the fries we never received packed up to go.  We declined.  Not even sure he was working the patio or if he was the poor schmuck sent to deal with the red-headed stepchildren on the patio.  Hopefully this proves to be the exception and not the rule since the service was wonderful the first time we went and the burgers really are pretty good.   We'll probably give it one more shot before switching back to the burger-and-beer special Whole Foods runs.",

We also had a beer and a soft drink from their root soda fountain. I believe our total was around $26.   There was a long line that went out the door. It took a little bit of time to get to the counter but the staff was helpful and brought out samples of the shakes and fries while we waited. Once we got through the line and placed our order we were seated and our food came out fairly quickly.   The Green Chile Queso came out before our burgers and was very good as an appetizer and we continued to munch on it after our burgers came out. Both of these burgers were delicious. I really enjoyed my hamburger, it was cooked all the way through but was still juicy and the toppings really added to the flavors. I was a little skeptical at the thought of having pesto and goat cheese on a burger but it was a good combination and I am hooked. My wife's burger was equally as good.   Overall the meal was very good. I think the burgers are better than Zinburger and they cost a little less. I see a few comments about the order process and while it is different I did not feel there was any reduction in the service. I really like this place and we will definitely be back.",

I should have just went with the truffle fries like previously recommended but I went with the reg. I'll definitely try the truffle fries next time. The feel of the restaurant is quite nice. It feels laid back, kind of like a sports bar yet nicer and newer. They have TV's so you can watch a game, a bar area, and a sort of unique way of ordering (order food at the counter then they'll bring it to you).   This place isn't amazing but it's a fun, chill place to get decent food. Will go back again!",

Before Hop Daddy, holstein's burger restaurant at the cosmopolitan hotel was the best burger place I've been to, but tonight that all changed. Hop daddy was the best burger I've ever had. I have celiac disease and they were very accommodating. I had the magic mushroom burger on a gluten-free bun, with Parmesan truffle fries. They filled out an allergy ticket, and took all the precautions to make sure that my food wasn't contaminated.  The truffle fries were also excellent. We also didn't have the typical order from the counter experience. We sat at the bar which is full service, the bartender takes your order and brings the food right to you.",

I had never visited Hopdoddy before, so the ordering concept for me and the other person I was with was a bit overwhelming. But our cashier was right there and was very patient with all our questions!   I loved the options in the soda machine. They use the healthier option of pure cane sugar over the sweeteners and actual sugar in their drink options. Cream Sods is awesome! I hadn't had it ages and I have always loved it. A delicious healthier option.    Our fries were hot and delicious. Our burgers were tender and juicy and delicious.   Servers were attentive and even offered to fill drinks for us, although it is self-serve. Decor and mood was upbeat and urban hipster. I loved it and will go back soon!",

    "text": "This was my first time at Hopdoddy. I ordered a burger special with pimento cheese, bacon, onion, watercress, and a fried egg.  I believe it was called the Pinetop burger.  The burger was excellent.  Each ingredient was at its best showing...especially the meat.  The burger itself was juicy and flavorful with appealing texture. Kudos to Hopdoddy for using beefsteak tomatoes.  The fries were the typical skin-on fries of places trying to be more than In-N-Out. They were fine, but not special.  Oddly, some were super limp and soggy while others were shatteringly crisp.  If you get them (and I wouldn't again), try dipping them in Hopdoddy's Sassy Sauce (mayo, honey mustard, and a touch of horseradish).   The surprise highlight was my bloody mary.  Normally, I loathe beets, but I'm so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered it anyway.  Hopdoddy uses beet juice as an accent to their BM mix.  They use just enough to give a little earthy complexity for depth and lend a pinch of sweetness to smooth out the rich, savory tomato flavor.  It's spicy, but still friendly.  The bloody mary is a must try for a leisurely lunch or or a hair of the dog Sunday brunch.  Hopdoddy loses a star for execution of service.  It is uncomfortably straddling fast casual and sit-down restaurant service protocol.  It's awkward at best, and it's just screaming with potential for customer service disasters.  For example, our \"server\" didn't know we were there because we moved from Table 67 and no one told him. He didn't come over until we were just about done eating and never really had a chance to connect with us because the servers are all over the place seemingly doing a bit of everything.  In short, I think the front of house needs some re-tooling.  Either do away with the ordering window or make the experience more self-service.  However, the customer service issue was hardly a deterrent.  Considering the excellent burgers, spot-on cocktails, and the pleasant, clean, contemporary atmosphere, we'll back soon.  (BTW, do not sit at Table 67 because you're too close to the bathrooms.  Any closer and you'd know exactly who the chili burger disagreed with.)",

I tried the spiced cider they had on draft and it was yummy!  There are lots of seating options, booth, bar, outside. My reason for the 4 stars is the whole order process.  You order at the counter and you feel pressured, not by the staff, to make a quick decision.  You are assigned a table and a server so why can't you just do it all at the table and absorb the menu and all the beers and drinks??",

My husband orders the Llano Poblano which is an all beef burger, applewood bacon, pepper jack, seared poblanos and a Chipotle aioli. It's got a nice kick without being too much. I order the ahi tuna burger without teriyaki sauce and on a whole wheat bun. The tuna is accompanied by sprouts, honey wasabi and nori chips. The nori chips provide a nice crunch and the sprouts provide a freshness that I love. Personally, I wouldn't order the bun this comes with. With the whole wheat bun, you are eating a burger without feeling terribly guilty. On the unhealthy side, their fries are so good! They also make their own dressings and sauces which go perfectly.   If you like beer, they serve craft beers in huge frozen goblets. Every time I go I have to grab a beer because of the frosty delightfulness.   Writing about this restaurant makes me want to go get my ahi tuna burger and beer now. I cannot wait to go back!!!",

The jalapenos were actually spicy, with just the right amount of sauce to not only prevent the bun from getting soggy, but also allow the other flavors to shine through. Man, just thinking about the burger is making me salivate! The highlight of the bruger were the mushrooms; I eat a lot of mushroom and these were damn good ones.  I had a side of the kennebec fries, which were crispy and delicious, and paired especially well with the chipotle ketchup. Next time I do want to try the parmesan truffle fries though! Or the green chile queso with fries. Or the chili con queso with fries...  Although my s/o didn't like the whole ordering at the counter and paying before getting table service (because you're tipping before you get the service, so you can't adjust accordingly), I thought it was generally more efficient. The only thing I would change if I came back is not getting the ginger lemonade because it was a little too gingery for my liking.",

Not much time was spent to research Hopdoddy as it was within the vicinity of a store we made a stop at and based on the restaurant itself having nice curb appeal, we gave it a go.  It's an order at the counter and they assign you to a numbered seat in the indoor or outdoor dining areas type of restaurant.  Each table has a number placed on a stand, so you basically just need to find where your table is at after you pay and get your beverage glasses.  I opted for the bacon cheeseburger which was a total win. My husband tried the mushroom burger(?) and he loved it just as much as I loved my burger.  The burgers were juicy, not too messy and simply cooked perfect and to my liking. We also shared French fries, they were just as amazing and nicely salted. They also offer a variety of house made ketchup.  I wasn't entirely in love with them, but they were still good.  The restaurant itself has a bar in the center and the service was great.  We got checked on during our meal without it being excessive.  There are TVs throughout, so if you're interested in watching what's on the tube versus being on your phone or talking to the company you're with, make note of that.  I travel to Arizona for work every year for Spring Training, so this will definitely be my pit stop as I make my way to the airport.  Now if only they can open a Hopdoddy in San Diego, I'd be SUPER HAPPY.",

Both were outstanding- perfectly cooked patties and the exact ratio of bun you hope for on a juicy burger. They're toasted, but pillowy soft. A waitress came to check on us and we were so pleased that she invited us back for happy hour which sounded great!!  Feedback- upon entering, there is no signage telling you what to do. We saw some people in a line and no hostess. We wanted a booth so we took a walk around asked a waiter about seating. He told us to get in line and we would be given a table. When we got up to order we were asked where our table ticket was. Apparently you need to find an empty table and grab the little ticket number off of the paper towel stand before you go order. The problem is there's no signage to tell you to do this. I'm not sure why the waiter didn't mention it. No harm done, we got a booth and now we know. The barbecue sauce has too much Worcestershire  in it. Other than that this place was delightful!! We'll definitely be back!",

Right when you walk in you grab a menu and head to the front. The tables are all numbered so they bring you the food depending what table you pick. I loved the options of fountain drinks.   The burgers came quickly and were a hit. Juicy and had lots of flavor. The fries were okay for me. Service was great the whole time. Our server checked on us many times and was helpful in getting refills even though we were able to get it ourselves.  If we had one of these closer to me I'd definitely go back more.",

The whole place has a great buzz about it with nice vibes. Jason (the mgr) is clearly running an A team here. Keep up the great work guys!",

It was about 7 pm and the place was really busy, however only one person was taking orders, so it took quite some time. Once we ordered our truffle fries and milkshakes arrived within a few minutes. The fries were great, the milkshakes were average at best.  Our four burgers arrived, and of the four, two had to be sent back. One was missing bacon, which apparently was due to the kitchen being out of bacon but we weren't informed ahead of time and charged for it. The bison burger was sent back due to being undercooked but the kitchen also ran out of bison by then so a hamburger was subbed. Both times the staff was helpful and brought extra fries, but it was disappointing nonetheless.  The burgers weren't great and the price point was fairly high given the average quality.   Unfortunately, there are better burger places nearby I would opt for over Hop Doddy.",

Friends had recommended this location - and sure enough, when I walked in, we were greeted by friends at the bar!   They gave me the down-low.  If you sit at the bar, you get full service.  If you don't sit at the bar, you have to stand in line, order your food at the counter, then get a table, where they take your drink order.  So you have to pay two different bills - weird.   My husband is not a fan of ordering at a counter (too much pressure while others wait for you to review the menu).  So we opted for the bar - which was a great choice.   First - the serving team was fun and helpful.  They talked us into their daily milk shake  - pumpkin pie.  Yes, a whole piece of pie went into that puppy.  Awesome.  My friends said I had to try the Magic Shroom burger.  It was delicious!!!  The wheat bun was fresh made.  Hubby ordered the Greek lamb burger and an order of the Parmesan Truffle fries.  We let them know that he has a standard for the crispiness of fries (in a fun way!) and they delivered!    Although we felt the Greek burger was okay, we both LOVED the beef/mushroom burger with yummy goat cheese. Yes - we ate it all.  And to top it all, they offer a discount for veterans.   This is definitely a place we want to return to - sooo many more burgers to try.",

I ordered a regular burger and truffle fries . Was hungry for a good burger and fries so it was a $30 splurge. Had to do a quick reheat on the fries. There were a lot of fries and only one teeny tiny half filled cup of sauce. Then the burger... I took a bite and it was cold and pretty raw inside although the outside was charred. I mean raw and cold enough no juice..bloody or not.. was running out of it. So into the Nuwave goes the chunk of burger. Once I got it to a nice medium it was pretty juicy. I think the toppings are pretty sparse for a burger that pricey, although the burger itself was a good size. So, basically very disappointed in this place.",

I recently had their Poutine burger... and it tasted like heaven. Also their customer service is exceptional. They're always there to assist. I will definitely be back again.  The only thing that I wish, is that they had is better soda. I'm just not a huge fan of their fountain drinks. The only decent one is the lemon lime soda, because it tastes like Sprite.",

The deal is that you are greeted by a host/ess, sent to order at the counter where you don't pay, then sent to an assigned table to wait for your food and be waited upon by a server. You pay your tab at the table.  I feel like we were unintentionally rushed through the whole process of ordering and dining even though it wasn't busy.   The Magic Shroom Burger was divine. I'm actually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was sold on the goat cheese and pesto. I think the tomato on the burger was even salted, which is an amazing touch if that small thing were actually thought about when crafting a burger.  The Green Chili Queso fries were top notch, although the fries could have been salted a little more heavily.   The Nutella Chocolate Pretzel shake was ho hum. I didn't taste any Nutella. Hmpf!  I'll make a return trip. Yep!",

The Angus beef patty was cook medium rear and the combination of the condiments was a tasy perfection brewing in my mouth.  My eldest son had the classic burger with cheese and an Oreo milk shake. My youngest had the continental club with a stout chocolate shake and they both shared an order of the kennebec fries. Needles to say we all walked out with a smile. As for the service, it was AWESOME right from the start we were greeted and assisted in the process. Throughout dinner we were asked if we need anything else.  If you haven't tried it stop by.",

Anyway here's the MEAT of the review. I sat in the little booth at the bar...and Crista was the bartender. Super sweet and on it. She even waited to put in my drink order so it hit happy hour. Thanks girl.   I ordered the St. Germain cocktail and it's delicious. Simple. Clean and a nice break from a burger.   I was between the mushroom burger and the Diablo and thanks to Crista I got the shrooms...so so so good. Cooked perfect. Delicious. But what kind of burger place serves their burgers without a side....it's 3$ up charge for a small fry.   However, they are so yummo. I love a skinny crispy fry. My favorite! Also seasoned well. Try the house ketchup and the truffle aoli. Yummy!  Good little spot. I'll be back again.",

    "text": "Hopdoddy is always a great go to for a great burger and brew. I wish this place wasn't a chain, but it sure doesn't act like one.  Why go there:  Their menu is straight forward and simple. They have a great variety of burgers made with quality meat (since they ask you for a preferred temp). The array of burgers should please the foodie as well as the picky eater. The brews are mostly local and served frosted chalices. They fries come in a generous cone and their soda machine carries craft sodas. It's a good switch up from the normal Coke or Pepsi products.  Don't miss: I would suggest to pair up a good burger with the right beer. They do serve up a mean truffle aioli ask for that even if it doesn't come with your burger and fries. The shakes are also very well done. Big enough to share between you and yours.  Tip:  Keep cool with the seating system. It's a bit of a different approach, but they make it work. If you get a beer, have them hold it until your food comes out if you want the full effect. The Orange Blossom on tap is wonderful served in that frosty chalice of theirs.",

    "text": "We ate here several weeks ago in search of a non-fast food burger. I decided you can't go wrong with the Classic, so that's what I ordered, along with fries and the Sangrita to drink. The burger did not disappoint. It had great flavor, was juicy, and had the right amount of toppings. It was a little overdone for my taste, however. I think they said it would be medium to medium-well when I ordered; it was definitely well-done. One suggestion: ask for a side of the Sassy Sauce to dip your fries. The cocktail was tasty and generous with the booze.  The biggest detractor was the service. I didn't read the Yelp reviews before we went, but many echo my biggest complaint, which is how Hopdoddy straddles the fence between fast-casual and traditional table service. When you walk in, someone greets you, gives you a menu and assigns a table number. After we ordered at the counter, she gave us a different table number...next to the bathroom. No, thank you. The \"hostess\" sat us at a new table. Our \"server\" came to our table as we finished eating. He told us he didn't realize we moved tables, but he had walked past ours several times, servicing his other tables. After waiting for the check, we flagged him down to ask him to bring it. \"Oh, jeez, I thought I already brought you the check.\"   A definite big fail on the customer service, but that would not prevent me from coming back, as the burgers and the drinks were great.",

I had some of my husband's fries which I'm happy to say are not fried in oil that could cross contaminate gluten free folks.  He really liked the burger and will return without me.....good;) The total cost of the meal was kinda high. A burger, fries (which don't come complimentary with the overpriced burger), beer and salad was $34 and that did not include tip.

On your credit card copy, there is a place for a tip and a reminder than normal tips are 15% , 20% and 25%.  If you didn't notice that, the staff has a handmade sign reminding you to tip.  Can you see how it's sort of weird to ask for a tip before service? The service itself was good but it is limited which isn't the staff's fault.  You get your own drinks, ketchup, napkins, straws etc.   This time I had and IPA and the El Diablo burger and my wife had a classic cheese burger which they advertise as coming with Tillamook cheese. I can buy that cheese at Safeway so I don't find the value there. The beer comes in a glass goblet.  My Diablo was dripping in sauce but the meat wasn't seasoned enough for my liking. Wife said hers was just OK. The fries are very good here, especially the Truffle fries.    This was our second time and out my wife and I figured it was OK but that's it.  Both times it seemed like it was going to be better than it was.",

The staff there are always very polite and exude friendliness and help when needed. The only thing keeping this place from being 5/5 stars is that recently, they changed their soda flavors from some very amazing, out of the box flavors to some very odd-tasting flavors. We used to enjoy many of the flavors, and our favorite was the Mexicane Cola. On our last visit, we were disappointed to find out that they no longer had the same soda flavors. In their place were some strange, washed-down tasting sodas. We'll continue coming to Hopdoddy's because their food is that amazing, but we truly hope to see their original soda line return.",

About 45 minutes later get to the counter and I'm excited to order the impossible burger because I am vegan. Was told that they have been out of impossible patties for a while. I should've been told that when I first walked in. They named other vegan burgers so I got the black bean burger and it came out dry and crumbly. They also forgot the onions in the burger. I've had a decent visit before but the rest were not very close to being good and far from great. Don't plan on coming back.",

This time I got the Diablo, no tomato or salsa (salsa is chunky, like pico, and I don't really dig chunky fresh tomato). Regardless of the tomato, this burger was awesome. Didn't get much habanero, but lots of serano, which is one of my faves. Blazin' burger... Word of warning to those that don't like really spicy stuff...  Sat at the bar, Service was great. I like this place. Funny though, they have 2 of these within close proximity of each other. It's an Austin establishment and they only open one in Houston... In the midtown area.

I have driven by & wondered if the food is any good at what appeared to be a nice looking gastropub..., only after a very bad experience at a zero-star gourmet burger competitor, did we happen to try Hopdoddy & WOW! Exceeded our expectations so much we told our friends & encouraged them to come a few days later with all the kids.  Although every restaurant has its up & down days, H'doddy was short staffed & wasn't the WOW we had the prior visit (which is why this review is not a 5-star).  All in all, great place... with some interesting surprises like the different choice of fountain drinks, but for example, the charcoal-filtered water (or infused water) is delicious & our kids preferred water over the fountain drinks & that's not a bad thing (except for sales) for the family.  Definitely Hopdoddy will remain a family & friends favorite to our family.  Thank you Hopdoddy!",

It's a different texture but there is so much flavor and you don't feel so heavy after eating it.   When feeling a little guilty but still craving starch, I will order sweet potato fries but unfortunately never fully be satisfied. Not this time! The sweet potato fries were crispy, lite made perfectly! On top of our delicious meal I love the different ketchups. Seems simple but it's the simple things in life that we appreciate most!

When we first walked in we were confused if it was a sit down place, an order & find your own table place or what. It took a minute, but then someone came up to us & asked where we wanted to sit. He helped us get a table which was great, but he didn't explain anything else until I asked if we ordered with him and then he said no & explained the process. From there it was smooth sailing & delicious food. We had Goodnight/ Good Cause Burger & the Classic Burger with bacon & cheese. Both were great & cooked to probably medium rare, which was great for us, but if that's not your preference it could be an unwelcome surprise. We also shared their green chili cheese fries which were bomb. Definitely on the salty side, but so good. The only other downside for me (and this is just personal preference) is that they use a lot of plastic forks which 1. didn't really fit with the feel of the place or the real steak knife that came alongside and 2. Just seemed wasteful. For the food mentioned above we ended up with 4 plastic forks and we used 1. All-in-all I'll be back now that I know how the process works & can ask for not so many forks :)",

Happy to report that the restaurant is clean and comfortable and that we only encountered friendly people working there. The product is the same deliciousness that we expected and the Atmos is really nice. The only feedback I'd have for this restaurant is that I found it unappealing to have to stand next to a stack of dirty dishes with partially eaten food while waiting in line. The location of your bussing station right by the ordering station is odd and not what I want to experience before eating. You should add a higher wall there or something if there's not a better location for it. Otherwise, thumbs up all the way around.",

But anyways, the last time I went to hopdoddy and probably the last time my partner will ever go there. We got fries, drinks and burgers. I got the impossible burger and it was great ! I had no issues with my food. However, my partners burger was far from what they wanted. They said the flavor was very off, and it was supposed to be well done which means no pink at all in the burger and it was barely medium. They took 3 bites and left the rest to be thrown away. The server helping us didn't make any attempt to give them anything else. Maybe review with your kitchen staff what meat temperatures are.",

This is a trendy unique little place in a shopping plaza. The glass architecture allows for a brightly lit dining experience  Upon arrival you're asked to take a menu and you are seated. When you are ready to order just walk up to the counter and place your order. I ordered the El Diablo burger. They asked me if I was ok with a small ribbon of pink in the middle. I was good with it. Most places don't ask.  My burger and fries were out in a reasonable amount of time. My burger was cooked exactly as they said it would be. It came with lettuce, caramelized onions, tomato, habanero and serrano peppers, and a spicy mayo sauce. All this was piled on to a slightly toasted bun. For all the spice it didn't take away from the flavor of the burger. The fries are made from honest to goodness potatoes, not the frozen processed ones. They still had skin on the tips. Slightly over cooked, but still good.  This was a good dining experience and I will be back when I'm in the area. My only regret is that I didn't try one of their signature milk shakes.",

The second time, we ate outside and we were definitely forgotten about. The busser probably helped us more than our server. So it's really hard to say what kind of service here is the norm.   A couple of things we noticed both times we ate there: 1) there is not a lot of difference between a small and large size fries, but they charge twice as much for the large. If we're paying twice as much, shouldn't we be getting twice as many fries? I guess not. 2) the shakes are delicious. 3) I consider the burgers here to be \"pretty good\", but not excellent. For the price, I'll take Shake Shack or The Stand.",

After ordering, it's unclear if it's full service or not.  A waiter or waitress may get you condiments but you can also just get your own.

    "text": "Almost every single review so far - pretty much every one 3 stars and below, and a number 4 stars and above - have mentioned the weird setup for ordering.  So...I'll start there.  We walk in and are greeted by someone who directs us to the menus in a menu holding place and tells us to step up and order at the counter.  On our way to the counter someone greets us to ask how many in our party and looking like they also might take our order.  Nope, this person is only taking our name for a table assignment.  Walk to the counter and place our order, after which they give us our table number.  Pulled out my card to pay, but nope, that's done after the meal when the \"server\" brings us our food.  Get our own drinks, then find our table with the assigned table number.  Now...that's not confusing, is it?  Then a server comes with our fries.  Pretty ok - nothing earth shattering.  Then another server comes (a while later) with our beer.  Ok.  Then our \"actual\" server comes to say hi and ask us how we're doing.  Doing ok, thanks.  Just a little confused.  So...waiting for our food thinking - ok, weird system, but the food must be awesome, right?  Not right.  Burgers come and immediately notice they are about 3/4 size compared to what you can get at many excellent burger places in a 2 mile radius.  So...must be delicious, right?  Not right.  Average, and that is being generous.  Bill comes and we pay server.  We like servers.  We want to support servers.  But...no way to justify the typical 20% plus tip we would normally give these hard working people.  Not their fault, just the system they are stuck in.  Give her a 10-15% tip to be generous, then leave.  Thinking...nobody who is a good server will stay here for long, the tips will always suck.  The system guarantees it.    I'm sure some restaurant efficiency genius got some award for this creative approach.  For us...one time was enough.",

I mean, I don't know how bison is usually made but it tasted great so I'm assuming it was cooked well. It was spicy and savory! I strongly recommend it.   I also got some of the Parnassian truffle fries. They were really good but I wouldn't recommend eating a while order by yourself. They are full of flavor and it can be easy to go a little over board with them. But the regular fries were equally delicious! Very brown and very crispy just like I like them!   I thought I might as well try a shake while I'm here and boy am I glad I did! I got the pretzel and Nutella shake by recommendation of our server. She did not let me down at all! The shake was pretty thin and easy to drink and was topped off with pretzel chunks. Needless to say it was amazing!!!   Only gripe was that when I walked in I was really unsure of what to do. Took me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to order at the counter. But now I know :)",

Well then you don't really know what to do next. There is a path in front of you, one to the left and one to the right. Hmmmm I didn't go out to eat to have to make these kinds of decisions. There is no hostess. So you keep walking straight. Then you see a big kitchen. Above the kitchen counter they have a big board which displays the menu. By default you stop moving forward and look. This causes a traffic jam and people behind you also become confused. Then we were asked to step to the counter. We do as instructed and the cashier asks what we would like. I say I have no idea this is all happening to fast. I have never been here and the choices are vast.  Anyways. We order and apparently you have to take a piece of paper with you to find a table that matches the number they write on the paper. I asked the guy where table 96 was and he had a hard time explaining it... That did nothing for my confidence, being the one who actually had to do the finding.   So.., then we find out we have a server. Oh but not a regular one. This server only brings your food and refills your ketchup. Also you have to get your own drinks at a fountain far from your table.   The fries were yummy that's the one star. The burgers were raw not medium well and we had them send them back multiple times until we gave up and went somewhere else. We didn't have to pay because apparently you do that after you eat instead of when your in line ordering??? So weird. I'm not a fan.   So take all of that and add to poorly cooked burgers and I shout a big no thanks to you kind sir.",

    "text": "Another in a growing number of gourmet burger restaurants with bar service.  This particular Hopdoddy Burger Bar opened about two months ago, and so it still gets pretty packed at dinner time, and some of the waitstaff are, clearly, still learning the ropes.   The plusses include a wide variety of customizable burger/sandwich options. The parmesan truffle fries are exquisite, especially with thei chipotle ketchup.  My personal burger favorite is the Terlingua chili cheeseburger  (I substitute the bison patty over the standard beef patty.)  My wife likes the Ahi burger, minus the wasabi sauce.   They have a very nice selection of beers on tap, including several IPAs.  Our children love the burgers, fries and shakes.   Now let me get to the part that I don't like,  and I'll make it short and simple.  If I'm going to pay sit-down restaurant prices for a gourmet burger dinner, and if there are waitstaff who expect a tip for table service, then why does Hopdoddy expect me to stand in line at a counter and order my meal like I was at McDonald's or Wendy's (and where the food is cheaper and there are no waitstaff who are expecting a tip)?  I find this service model to be very off-putting and, frankly, quite irritating.  In fact, it is so annoying that I struggled to give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 3 stars.  But those parmesan fries are so darned good....",

We have all the burgers and pizza you could possibly want within walking distance. It's like everyone around here never left summer camp.   But I'm here to talk about this place, and not just complain about our national state of extended early adolescence. We're all callow goobers who watch superhero movies and eat pizza and wear little baseball caps and can't stop watching porn. America.   Anyway. Where was I? Oh, the burgers.  Yeah, they're ok. They're mainly salt. As salty as the burgers are, the fries are even saltier. I don't know why they bother with salt shakers on the table. I can't imagine anyone thinking anything needed more salt. I think I shrank 5% from dehydration from one meal.   Hopdoddy features a full bar, which probably explains the avalanche of salt.   There appears to be little on the menu you can't get at Smashburger, or Zinburger, or The Habit, or The Grind, or Delux, or . . .   Hey, did you know they're putting an In-and-Out across the street? At least those are more like $7 burgers. Burger burger burger burger burger. Burgers. We got burgers.  Anyway, what Hopdoddy lacks in a varied menu, they make up for with this: Ordering there is weirdly inconvenient. You walk to the kitchen counter after talking to a hostess who doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose, then you place your order, then you're directed to a table. Someone brings you your order. And they ask you what else you need. But see, you already have just about everything you need because you got your own drinks already-- just like at McDonalds. So you say \"fine, everything's fine\" and they smile and leave. But then you notice there's no ketchup. So you have to wait for them to come back ask them to give you ketchup. But they only bring you a little dentist-cup full, not a bottle. So you have to ask for more. And they make another trip. They're pleasant about it, at least.  There's a line for tipping on the receipt. I really don't know why. All the pleasantness, I suppose.  I suppose you could go to Hopdoddy if that's what you want to do. I didn't feel threatened or anything.",

    "text": "I went here on a Wednesday night date night. It was both my boyfriend and I's first time here so we wandered in and were immediately confused. We stood around waiting for a hostess, and apparently there are no hostesses here. So we asked the bartender if we just seat ourselves or how it works. Instead of explaining that you order at the counter, she told us to just seat ourselves. So we did, so after waiting for a hostess that did not exist, we now were waiting for someone to take our order, which was apparently also not the way things were done. Also, we apparently fill up our own waters, which we were unaware about for the first half of our meal as we sat there with empty glasses. Waiting, waiting, waiting. While, half of me feels like I have no right to complain about the service due to the fact that we approached the restaurant all wrong, half of me feels obligated that there was no signs or explanation on what to do. For someone's first time it can be confusing since this is not how a typical sit down restaurant is run.   On to the food, I ordered the \"Terlingua\" burger, my boyfriend ordered a classic burger, we split an order of small fries, and we split a shake for a total of just over $30.00. The meat was tender and the fries were well seasoned. I would have preferred that my burger be a little warmer than room-temperature just so the cheese was actually melted. Overall, it was an OK experience, but I can find a better burger with better service elsewhere.",

In&out Burger far more enjoyable and half the price and both require standing in line to order. ZinBurger also beats em. Too bad also, cause the place is nice to look at but that's not enough to return for another trip.",

We walk to the counter and I order the Diablo bu rger and the Parmesan truffle fries. We don't pay, but are given two empty cups (for water) and a table #. So we look for our table # and we wait....  I thought we had to find water and serve ourselves, but finally some employee came by to fill water for us. Then, we get this waiter of some sort - he asks us if we are ok, our food will come soon, etc. We finally get the food and the burger was a little on the medium side, but packed with so much spice and flavor. The fries weren't bad and I enjoyed it too. This waiter comes by again and we ask for ketchup and aioli, we get that in little plastic cups (kinda tacky).   When we were done, this waiter comes by again and drops our check off so we can pay. So yea, we assumed he was our waiter even though he didn't take our order and gave him a tip.

My husband loves spicy food and says the Diablo burger is one of the best in town with regards to spice level. He says that it's extremely well put together, with the perfect amount of spice. We usually get a side of fries as well with the aoli sauce. This place is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great burger in Phoenix.",

Given the restaurant was quite busy, our food was delicious and we were impressed by the presentation. Service however on my first visit was atrocious and I waited 2o minutes for the waitress to come and give me my check and another 25 minutes for change. This is now I believe my fourth time here and the service provided by Meghan has been the best so far. She was friendly and smiling and offered suggestions on my next burger: ad avocado to the poblano burger so it contrasts the spiciness if the peppers and your mouth isn't as fire for so long. I will continue returning to HopDoddy thanks to Meghan and her service and the quality of the food.",

You're not able to customize your burger all that much and if you do they'll charge you for every little bit that you change.

It's made of wheat, potato and who knows what else but it's delicious and I could eat one every single day. If you don't think about it while you eat, it takes exactly like a regular burger but BETTER!  We always pair our burgers with their Parm Truffle Fries and OMG those are the best fries! Always crispy, fresh, and always more than enough to stuff your face!   The waitress also recommended a Sea Salt Carmel Shake, and to add Nutella and Pretzels.

For my burger if you will, I went with the Thunderbird, it's a chicken burger with apple smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, avocado, poblano chili, pico de gallo and chipotle aioli. OMG this is my favorite burger from Hopdoddy! SO dang good!!!!  You really can't go wrong with any of burgers there, my second favorite is the Ahi Tuna Burger and 3rd and 4th runners up are the Llano Poblano and El Diablo! So good!

    "text": "Hopdoddy removed their best item, the buffalo fries. Sometimes me and my girlfriend would come just for h the e buffalo fries, and it was what caused us to recommend them to countless people just for these fries. Lately they changed the menu, removing the buffalo fries even though it was probably their most popular fry, and kept the honey and sage fries, which are so bad when we tried them one day we couldn't eat them and had them returned even. We aren't that picky eaters but those sage fries are truly disgusting, and yet the buffalo fries were removed and they are still on the menu, absolutely ridiculous. I just want hopdoddy to understand that it's a great burger place, truly great food, but to listen to it's customers and bring the fries back. It was there reason we chose hopdoddy over most other places, and now there's no reason to go.",

We came in at 7pm... put in our order, waited 25 minutes for our hamburgers that came without our orders of fries. We saw multiple orders bring processed before ours. Finally, all but one hamburger order came. And that one order never did despite one of the worker bees coming over to say it was on the grill as they had gotten his order mixed up?? My brother-in-law went up and asked the cashier for his refund as he did not want the hamburger anymore. Meanwhile, a couple had been seated after and next to us and received their drinks and order of hamburgers. The manager did nothing to compensate our wait/inconvenience. We were there an hour!! We left irritated and with a hungry man!! That's a wrap for us!",

There is a fairly large bar you can sit at or a number of booths throughout.    We ordered the classic cheese burgers - mine with a gluten free bun.  The gfree bun was really good and not the classic Udi's bun I usually find.  We also tried the chili Queso fries.  My friend liked hem better than I did.  I like my friends kind of crispy and a few bites I had were still a little mushy in the middle.  The milkshakes!!  Holy cow these were good.  I tried the Bananas Foster caramel one and my friend tried the malted root beer one.  These were chalk full of calories but so delicious every once in a blue moon.    I would definitely go back.",

Buffalo frys were awsome  ordered the mushroom burger (aka Shroom burger) medium / rare... very great came as ordered  Ordered the s'mores shake way too good.  They do not use peanut oil so it was super safe for me   Cons....   Frys do not come with burgers so the frys were extra  but was way worth it.   Bonus points ...  Also have a goodnight / good cause burger that donates money to the Alice Cooper foundation that gives culinary dance and music lessons to kids and teenagers. Even better : )  Thank you for a great experience  Will definitely be back",

    "text": "I've passed this place a thousand times, but didn't go until my wife found out they had the famous \"Impossible Burger\" which is basically the meatiest tasting vegan burger out there right now. I'm a huge meat eater and even I could be fooled by it. It's only available in a few places so any time she's sees it she gets excited.   I ordered the Primetime burger, their signature burger, with kobe beef. The burger was well dressed and tasted good, but in my opinion it could have been juicier, maybe because the lean kobe beef? I'd like to go back and try one of the other burgers without kobe next time I go.   The truffle fries are amazing. The truffle sauce was really good. The gentleman at the counter realized we were a first time customer and generously gave us a sample of their queso dip to dip our fries in too. Delicious and will definitely order in the future. All in all a great burger experience, a little pricier than your average burger joint but worth it in quality and all the extras.",

I also want to mention a 25% discount will be offered to all FED government employees (and family) until the shut down is resolved . YOU MUST BRING YOUR WORK ID!   Not only was the food wonderful but the service was excellent!  Staff was eager to help and accommodate our large party without hesitation.  Food came out hot and found to have deliciousness in every bite! Thank you for being the best part of our day!!  You are appreciated!",

You wait in line  to order and then someone gives you a table #.  I ordered the Hail Ceasar Salad with a Kobe burger add on which I requested M, thinking that's cooked through although it came to me pink. When I asked for a little more cook waiter said can't do that but will get you another patty. I decide to eat around the more cooked edges & take home to reheat.  The  salad was tasty.  My guy got the Llano Poblano Burger MR & he liked it.  He said it was nice & juicy & not too spicy.  He also ordered the Green Cheese Fries which is a cheesy peppery sauce.  I'm glad he got the sauce on the side since it was more like gravy, thick but tasty.  We both ordered the Topo Chicos.  The staff shares tips which sometimes is a good thing and other times not since some work better than others.  It also appears that Hopdoddy is 420 friendly since there was a nod to that on some of the t-shirts.  Fun and tasty, we'll be back.",

The actual patty was good, the meat is top quality, but it wasn't well seasoned. I had the Buffalo fries, and they were decent, although cold. Finally, I had a root beer float shake, I didn't like it, and it was room temperature. The tepid fries and room temp milkshake didn't prove for the best experience...

Cut each in 1/2 and shared so that we could each try each other's order.  Fries didn't get to hang around long as we scarfed them down! Delicious. Soda made with pure sugar reminded us of the old days, how soda used to taste.  We got the root beer. Servers we're friendly and helpful from the moment we entered. We are looking forward to our next visit already!   PS .. I read a couple of the reviews and people were very happy with the restaurant but only gave four stars. Not sure why.  It's 5 star  IMO",

It's like they didn't want to do counter service but had no real interest in full service either- so they just muddled the two to all oblivion.   Two employees (tried to) explain the process and we were still left confused and honestly a little frustrated before we even sat down. Order at the counter in the back middle of the place, walk backwards get your own drink and condiments, try hard to remember the table number you were told 8 minutes ago, sit down and wait. You're then repeatedly told that you're now receiving \"full service\" when you just did everything the same as if you were at let's say a Chipotle. I've served for 12 years and id still never leave 20%. I FRIGGIN DID EVERYTHING.   The food was decent but for $30 I'll go to Smashburger and have a feast, not two (smallish, super dry, and overcooked) burgers and one side of fries with a forced gratuity.",

I walk up to cashier who answers any questions I have about the menu. I would imagine that if it had been busy, this system would cause quite a back up.   After I place my order, I get my drink. 2 stars for having the best soda fountain around (Maine Root). I go to assigned table. Server brings food.

Everyone else liked their burgers but had the same issue. We also got the green chile fried and they were good but overpriced. Those buns tho...yum! Excellent! Even the gluten-free bun was good.

Tasted the Buffalo Bill made with Bison grind and a precious tasty red rover Irish ale. Superb.  Added House fries for a special touch. Sat at the bar and was superbly serve by the corporate Trainer, who opens the Doddy's all over the US. Needless to say, I barely had to speak, as Jeff anticipated every possibility within a split second. A force to be reckoned with!  The whole experience was top drawer and quite tasty! Do it! Do IT!",

There was still a line for lunch, but definitely not as bad as dinner. I was a little confused for a while, I wish they had a bigger menu in front of the line on a board where we can look at or something. While we were in line, they didn't have enough menus for people to look at -- by the time we got to the counter, we were still a little unsure of what to order.   We ordered the mushroom burger and the ahi tuna burger with a side of truffle fries. I also got the salted caramel shake which is actually really good! The food was actually very tasty! It's this fast casual service that's kinda turning me off. I'd still come back though for lunch! I'm curious to try the other burgers!",

    "text": "My friend from Dallas has been raving about this place for quite some time so we decided to check out their new AZ location on my lunch break. From the moment you walk in, you can tell this place is more of a restaurant than a fast food joint. Servers bring the food to you and you pay at the end of your meal, as you would in a restaurant, but you order in the beginning in a line (then they assign you/your party a table). It's an interesting concept that's for sure.  Anyways on to the burger. I ordered the Terlingua which included chili, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and the best part -- Fritos! I'm a huge fan of Taco Bell's Beefy Crunch Burrito so I knew I'd be a fan of crunchy Fritos inside a juicy burger. Just as I expected, the combo was a hit! I also tried some of my friends fries which were pretty good although I've had better elsewhere. I will definitely have to try the truffle fries and one of their amazing looking milkshakes on my next visit there (when I'm not planning on going for a run in the afternoon lol).",

I had the ahi tuna burger and it was truly fantastic, right amount of flavors!  However, I am still confused about the concept of HopDoddy. You get in and you're not sure what you're supposed to do.. Sit somewhere, wait, go at the bar.. I didn't see any signs that tells you where to go. After a few seconds, we were greeted by the bartender that told us that we were supposed to order at the counter ?  So I guess you stand in line, choose your burger, order at the counter and then they assign you a table with a server? That's a weird concept.. You have to get your water at the soda machine.   Why do we even have a server then? I'm quite confused. We did all the work already.. So it's between a fast-food and a restaurant.  Plus, there were so many servers walking around. I am not sure why they need that many servers.. It seemed useless.  Anyway, we will be back, however this time we will sit at the actual bar so we can get a full and real service! The burgers were really good!",

The burger had amazing taste and was extremely juicy. The fries were suggested by the cashier and I'm truly glad I took her advice. I would go back here to eat in a heart beat!   My only disappointment was the service. The kitchen forgot to make a plate of fries for one friend, and entire burger for another and the bar took 45 minutes to bring a margarita for another. That's the reason I give it three starts. Three HUGE mistakes for one table. The odd part, you order at the cashier and she's punching it all in. The servers only bring you the food. So I'm not really sure how they \"misplaced\" the orders. Great food, service sucks!",

I also heard that HopDoddy brings together the two greatest things on earth - Burgers and Beer.  So why not try it!  Let me tell you folks - the burger was thick and juicy and Kennebec fries were outstanding. Our server was great and was the manager.  We even got a treat.  When we got there right at opening we were the only guess. But when we left it was standing room only.  Definitely a place to try!",

The green chile queso fries were odd, the fries were not crunchy even though they were freshly baked, and the queso was soupy. I asked if the queso was supposed to be so watery and I guess it is.  The service set up doesnt make sense, you walk in they tell you where youre gonna sit, you go order your butger at the counter then take a seat. The fountain drinks are self serve but you also have a waiter . The experience felt broken up , all that said everyone working here was attentive and provided excellent service.

    "text": "We went to Hopdoddy to try it out, we love trying new things and it looked really great!  We walked in and were immediately confused. The counter was on the other end, there was nobody at what seemed to be the host area, then we realized we had to go stand in line. Someone came to use with a piece of paper and asked us how many we had in our party. There were two others in front of us and we weren't sure what was going on. He was annoyed because the gal helping us thought that we were all together but weren't. There was a lot of confusion with the staff on who had been helped and who didn't which left a lot of us in line confused. None of us in line had ever been there. Once we told her it was just two of us, she took our name and went up to the registers. We got to the registers and then had to order, but we didn't have any menu to go off of. There weren't menus to be had and there wasn't any menu board like other \"order at the register\" places. We chose what we wanted and then she asked us if we were \"Scott\". I said no, we are \"Daniel\". She rifled through a pile of small papers to find the little note the previous lady had written down of who we were. After we ordered we expected to pay there at the register, but they prompted us that we would be sitting at table 22 and then our server would be providing full-service from this point forward.   I am not sure what \"full-service\" means when we already walked to the counter, ordered our food, went to the other side to get our condiments and drinks. We never actually met a server. There was a food runner, someone passing out sample shakes, a manager who came to say hi, and then a random guy who checked on us once. I am totally fine with ordering at a counter, getting my own things, etc. It was just confusing. Is this a sit down restaurant, or is this an order at the counter burger stand place? Both are awesome...but combined it was chaos and really confusing.   Working in hospitality, no guest should ever be confused. I thought it might be because they were new, but then I was over hearing other customers saying the same thing. How confused they were, or \"what is the point of this concept\"? Nobody seemed mad or angry, just kind of like \"huh?\" Once we paid, we were prompted on the ticket to tip. I always tip, even if the service is bad...because I know it isn't always the servers fault or for so many reasons. I just don't believe in being a jerk and not tipping. However, what were we tipping? Nobody did anything. We still tipped, but yeah, didn't make sense.   The food was ok. My partner enjoyed is burger. I ordered the vegetarian option. I didn't finish it. It was a black bean burger, just like every other restaurant. Seems to be that everyone's answer to vegetarians is a black bean burger. This one had way too much going on. Beats, cilantro sauce, goat cheese, etc. It was a lot of flavors that made no sense. Also, I can literally get a black bean burger at every other place that offers burgers...which now I don't frequent because it's the only option out there. Restaurants need to start getting more creative. Southwestern black bean burgers are not what we vegetarians want.   The saving grace was the manager. She was so sweet and just came by to get our feedback. We gave some kind feedback and she was lovely. She noticed I didn't eat my burger and she asked why, so I told her very politely. She didn't comp the burger, but I wasn't expecting it. If I were in that situation and in a new restaurant, I would have done that, but again, I didn't expect it nor did I ask.   We have a lot of options in this area, so most likely won't be returning. I hope the manager gets the experience she is looking for and moves on to something better. She was great.",

I ordered the mellow mushroom burger. I like that the burgers were big enough but not ginormous. My well done was cooked to perfection. Plenty of plain and parmesan fries for all of us to share. Burger beef was excellent quality and flavor. The guys said habanero was super spicy but cold beer helped. Burger burns had lightly toasted buttery taste. Bread was not too dense nor light. It was just perfect. Very satisfying meal and great customer service. Sister said the milk shake was delicious.",

I asked her for condiments which she brought right back for me. She was also the one who cleared the table. My \"server\" was totally useless and did nothing besides walk by and ask if it was good. I did tipped him because I don't stiff people, but he was terrible. The girl running food out should have gotten the tip. I even had to have someone hunt down my server so i could pay to get out of there. I'm not sure why there is a line for tipping on the bill or why you just don't pay at the counter when ordering. That's pretty lame. The service was great from the person who wasn't my server and it was a really good burger, but not sure about repeating, which is the name of the game.",

What I don't get is that I already did everything so what is this person going to do for me.

It's not about the $3-$5 it's about how it makes no sense and is really more of an inconvenience.

    "text": "ALMOST perfect...  While I usually post reviews based primarily on the quality of service (or lack thereof), i'm going to base this review primarily on the quality of the FOOD. Reviews on food joints like this can be a challenge since we all have different taste buds and what one person finds delicious might be what another person finds average at best. With that being said, I think I have a pretty good palate at this point in life & i'm definitely a food-lover to say the least who can tell when the slightest thing is off when it comes to something I order.   To date, I have visited Hopdoddy at least 4 times (several times during the day, once in the evening). I ate onsite during the first visit & ordered to go during the other two visits. While I have yet to try ALL of the burgers &/or menu items, I can safely say that the FRESHNESS/quality of the burger & associated ingredients (lettuce/tomatoes/etc) at Hopdoddy is UNMATCHED. I have always been a fan of FRESHNESS when it comes to food. I don't like stuff to taste stale/frozen/reconstituted/etc especially when i'm spending a nice chunk of change on what i'm eating. Hopdoddy isn't exactly cheap, but when I know that i'm getting my money's worth when it comes to the CONSISTENT freshness/quality, i'm ok with spending a little extra every now & then. As stated, I visited this place several different times at the time of this review, & each time the FRESHNESS/quality was spot on. The way they season the burger is beyond my understanding because the patty is just bursting with plenty of flavor (unlike burgers you may get elsewhere, where you have to dunk it in all this ketchup/etc just to excite your tastebuds). In my opinion, any time you can visit a place several times & the food is always spot on, you've got a winner. The milkshakes are also delish, albeit slightly different from the norm (they make all of them with like this cinnamon-based custard, so any flavor shake you order has a noticeable hint of cinnamon): Thankfully I like cinnamon, but this might throw someone else off (as it did with my mother who gave me hers lol).   MY ONLY COMPLAINTS:  1. It has been a while since my last visit (currently on a special diet), so maybe this has changed since then: If so, please disregard this first complaint, but I wish this location had the option to call ahead & order &/or order online (or via an app). At the website, it states that online ordering is available in \"select cities\". Why Phoenix (the 6th largest city in the United States of America) is not considered one of these \"select cities\" is beyond my understanding. Aside from my very first visit, all of my visits were TO GO orders where I would come in from the gym (EXTREMELY hungry) and order. I realize that this is not a fast food place, but truth be told I hate coming in & having to sit at the bar (or a table) while I wait for them to cook my food. Maybe it's a ploy to squeeze a bit more money out of the customer for the bartender/etc but if I wanted to spend extra on tips/etc I would be eating onsite instead of ordering to go. Just my 2 cents.   2. Selection on the fountain drinks is limited. While tasty, most are carbonated & for someone like myself who has kept a good 15lbs of weight off just by eliminating carbonated drinks from their diet, it's frustrating to be forced into filling up with a carbonated drink unless i'm just in the mood for lemonade, tea or water (which are your only non-carbonated/non-alcoholic options at Hopdoddy).  3. When done RIGHT, the fries are also delicious... But during my last few visits, the fries were overcooked/burnt which completely ruins it for me. It's seriously happened like 3 times in a row & I don't know if it's a new chef or what, but I absolutely hate hard/crunchy/burnt fries. On my last visit, I actually drove back up there & requested to have my fries replaced & to my dismay the replacement fries were just as bad: On my next visit, I will definitely be inspecting the fries before I leave, & if they're not right i'll be requesting a refund for that portion of my bill.  4. OK, OK... I said this review would be about the food, but lastly I must say that some of the servers are quite rude. In short, I came in once for a to-go order & after patiently waiting then paying for my meal (in cash) the server walked off with my money & took it upon himself to assume that I didn't want my change. When I requested my change (which I had to request from another server because my server disappeared once he got my money), the server eventually returned & had quite an attitude over the fact that I actually wanted my change back. He was snobby, unprofessional & rude, but I won't let one bad apple (the type of \"apple\" that is quite typical in this area) spoil the entire basket here: I just thought I would mention it.  So yea, Hopdoddy is my favorite burger spot in town right now, followed by Shake Shack & The Stand (although Shake Shack may become #1 very soon)! Check em all out!",

I wanted a table, so I asked if I ordered some fries, if I could have a table, and was told yes. I had to pay for the fries and wine, and then got my table. I was also told that all food was had to be ordered at the cashier, so when my guest joined me, we had to go back to the cashier to order our burgers. So, by the time I left, I had to pay 3 different times (once for the original fries and wine, once for our burgers, and once for drinks we could order at our table). This makes no sense to me. The food is delicious, but seems like a hassle to have to pay 3 times? It also annoyed me a bit that there seemed to be a lot of people standing around (even dancing to the music), but we had to flag someone down to get a drink. The food is good, but I don't understand the overall concept!",

I'm excited about our next visit to Hopdoddy.",

    "text": "My Husband and I are staying at a resort down the street from here and decided to try it out. I ordered the continental club turkey burger: no mayo, add avocado, (+$1), and pesto on the side. I got 2 tiny slices of avocado and the pesto was on the burger, (wanted to be sure I liked it before covering my burger in it), it ended up being very tasty. Overall my burger was very satisfying, the peppery flavor of the baby greens, well seasoned meat, and other toppings were a wonderful combination, however, I was upset that they couldn't follow simple direction with the pesto and charged me $1 for 2 thin slices of avocado. My husband ordered the El Diablo burger, it was cooked to order and he enjoyed it very much. We also ordered the \"shareable\" buffalo fries, unfortunately the ranch container that came on the side, was not closed properly and spilled all over the inside of the to go bag. Making it impossible to enjoy the fries the proper way as they were very dry and needed that ranch. Also leaving us with a mess to clean up! I would definitely like to try Hopdoddy again, perhaps to go orders are not their thing as they are extremely swamped in the restaurant.",

If only the food could keep up.  $36 including tip gets you two burgers, one \"large\" order fries and a soda.  The kobe burger, call the PrimeTime should be renamed after one of Doctor Who's famous aliens, the Slitheen.  The first bite will launch the slimy little patty squirting out, leaving you with a caramelized onions, brie and arugula sammy.  Even if it were tiny and tasty, i would give them four stars, but this food wants me to leave two, bumped to three because of the sheer niceness of the staff.  What ever happened to a nice big juicy burger where there is enough to taste.  Hoppy will leave you hungry and confused, wanting to just get behind the grill and save these nice people!  Let's hope the owner takes a trip over to Texas where big can be good ;)",

We split a burger with truffle fries and ordered a beer and were pleasantly surprised with everything. They do a burger and beer special for $10 which is a great deal based on the size and quality of the burgers. The atmosphere is industrial hipster and they have a great patio. Neat little place, not as chainy as I expected it to be. We will be back!",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a try as we were in the mood for some good burgers!  Location & Aesthetics -- Located just off E. Camelback Road just opposite The Container Store that's off N. 20th St.  It could be a little difficult to miss from the main streets but with a handy GPS you should be fine.  Once in the parking lot, and there's plenty of available parking, you can't miss the restaurant with it's large signage. There's available seating on the outside and inside, but this time of the year, most folks were seated inside.  I can't remember if I saw misters for the patrons dining outside.   Restaurant is clean (outside and inside) and well lit indoors.  Noise level was acceptable with music playing at a comfortable decibel level. There is a central bar area with bar stools and, of course on the periphery of the restaurant, seating all around.  Seating was booth-like and very comfortable with spacious tables.  Service -- Staff are very friendly.  The concept of being seated and ordering is quite unfamiliar to me so I was a bit lost on the customs of the restaurant.  Thankfully staff instructed me what I had to do.   When you enter, you immediately join the queue to order your food.  Once you're at the front of the queue, staff will either call you up to take your order providing there's an available table.  You give them your order and they'll show you your table. If there aren't any available tables, then they will let you know and basically, everyone who's waiting for a table (versus folks there for takeaway), has to stand and wait in line (no orders are taken) until a table opens up then the line moves again.  Very interesting concept which I've never experienced before and do like.  Menu -- Lots of available menus at the door when you enter.  The menu was one sheet, both sides, and very easy to understand with lots of descriptions.  We had questions on portion sizes on some items on the menu and staff was exception at helping us decide.  Food -- I had the classic burger with the bacon and cheese (Angus Beef, green leaf lettuce, white onion, tomato, and something called Sassy Sauce).  Sides are extra so we shared a large Kennebec fries, with a sea-salt caramel shake. Working backwards, the shake was rich, creamy and semi-thick (not too thick that you'll need a vacuum to suck it through the straw) though they will provide you with a plastic spoon in addition to the straw. The Kennebec fries (in case you don't know is from the medium-to-late-maturing white potato) was fresh, hot, and slightly salted which made it perfectly delicious! The burger itself was fresh, non-greasy, non-drippy, well seasoned, juicy, tasty, and very flavorful! With the wide variety of burgers they have on the menu, I will most likely be back to try some of the other options on the menu and do definitely recommend!  I've also heard they serve a mean watermelon mojito so that will be accompanying my next burger order on my return!",

Parking can be a challenge but don't let it deter you!  You can also bring your dog and eat on the patio.

We walked up to the counter to order and was told which table we were assigned to. From there, we had a waiter. The only thing the waiter did was bring out the food so I guess I don't understand why a waiter was necessary. They could simply have us pay at the counter and get a buzzer for when our food was ready. Oh well! There was this worker there that we really enjoyed. He wasn't our waiter but he walked around doing tasks. He had dreads and was wearing a hat. He walked around smiling, giving us thumbs up to check if we were okay, and was overall a happy guy! We like seeing workers enjoy their job.   FOOD Goodnight Burger - This burger donates $1 to Lone Star Paralysis so all the better. Delicious burger. Meat was tender and not at all dry. Flavors blended perfectly and every bite was really tasty.  When I got to the second half of my burger though, the bottom bun was so soggy I had to fork and knife it.   Llano Poblano - The flavors were not too crazy and the overall taste of the burger was really nice with the white onions. The poblano peppers was definitely a nice touch too. This burger did not get soggy! Woohoo!  Truffle Parmesan Fries - I wish the fries were a little bit crunchier. They were a little soggy but still had a good taste.  Solid burger place.",

Walked up to the register, where I could see my order already bagged and waiting, was ignored for a couple of minutes before I was loudly informed that I needed to go to the bar.

    "text": "This was my first visit, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service at this restaurant. I don't eat burgers often, however I was in the mood for a GOOD burger. A friend suggested Hopdoddy's, and the restaurant did not disappoint!   Our server Kristin, was very friendly & personable.  She made the dining experience a lot of fun from the start until the very end. I ordered the El Diablo burger and the Lil side salad. At medium-well temperature, the El Diablo burger packed a flavor-filled punch of spice & moisture. It was delish!  While the side salad wasn't exceptional, it was fresh and tasty.  A yummy strawberry margarita complimented my meal perfectly.   The ambience is quite pleasant. We were there on a Saturday evening, and they had a pretty steady flow of people, yet it never felt overcrowded or frantic.  I will definitely return to Hopdoddy's the next time I get a craving for a burger.",

First, a few things that I didn't love: I ordered a small salad with my burger and they went a little heavy on the dressing but it was still delicious.  I also ordered the Magic Shroom burger and there was something in it that I couldn't bite into; I had to discretely take it out of my mouth and set it on my plate (it was white, flat and small - about the size lead tip on a pencil).    Now for the good stuff:  Despite the mystery thing in the burger (stuff happens so I'm willing to go back but not if that continues for sure!), the burger itself was really great.  I have some annoying diet restrictions and the gal who took my order was very patient and helpful with what substitutions I could make.  The atmosphere is trendy.  A few gals at the table next to us were drinking shakes that looked amazing (we couldn't stop staring at them) and the waiter we had was attentive and nice.  Next time I'm trying the tuna steak and getting fries.  I feel like they balance each other out.  :)",

On this visit I ordered  the Bison Burger with truffle fries and my lunch companion had a Bacon Cheese Burger w/Green Chile Cheese Fries.The quality of burgers and selection of fries were good and our entrees were fresh and hot.  The atmosphere is fun and casual. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The prcing is reasonable, just kind of an average burger joint.",

Nothing special about it just lettuce and tomatoes and it's twice the cost of of all the other meat burgers with all the different toppings. Also paid $4 for a lemonade \"no refills\" of course and you get more ice than lemonade so I asked for no ice and they shamelessly brought me a half full cup of lemonade WTF? so I asked what's going on there? And  the girl replied with \"it's Ginger syrup and  lemon juice with water and if she adds more water it will be watered down\". Ok, then add more! Right?  the glass full of ice would have done- the exact same thing in 2 minutes because it's 114of right now. And so much for \"handcrafted\" \"no refill\" lemonade that my five year old could mix together. 2 stars only because the servers were very attentive and friendly",

We entered in with our one year old and we were sitting and eating our meal, and the waitress came over unprompted and asked if our baby would like a free sliced avocado to eat. That's amazing!! I don't think I have to tell you guys how much avocado cost these days and how stingy places are about giving you them. Instant five stars in my book. Not to mention, burgers here are great, so far I've tried the wagyu burger and the thunderbird which were both excellent. And I had an egg nog milkshake at last visit which was decadent and delightful. Go here to satisfy your lunch craving!",

The texture is more like meat for sure, but the taste is pretty bland.  I wouldn't get again.     The good:  the farmers market salad with tuna was outstanding.  So much flavor.  The hot and honey fries were really good and I would get again for sure.   The decor is trendy and fun.  They're Moscow mule was really good too.   My daughter had the mini margarita and was deeply impressed by it.   Just enough was what she said.  They have the natural sodas which I always think is a good thing.    The average:   The impossible burger was average at best.   The caso fries were not as good as advertised.  But that could be subjective as I was the only one at the table who thought so.     The bad:   Nothing to report.    Final thoughts: I did feel this burger joint was a little on the high side price wise for the food quality.   Two drinks a burger and a salad was over $50.00.   I would eat here again but only with a coupon.  If you're into trendy hipster joints this place is probably for you.",

I honestly thought it sounded like a weird combination of flavors, but my boyfriend was so excited to try it! He loved it. I tried a bite and I was pleasantly surprised by how well all the flavors went together! There was a good balance of sweet, creamy banana and peanut butter and savory bacon! I ordered the truffle Mac & cheese burger, a throwback burger that was voted back!! This burger was huge and very messy, but that's how I feel good burgers should be! On top of the meat, there is a truffle Mac and cheese patty that is perfectly cheesy and creamy. There's also savory caramelized onions and a truffle aioli that brings even more truffle flavor into the burger. This is definitely one of my favorites that I've tried so far and you should definitely go in before January 29th to try it yourself!! And don't forget to get some Parmesan truffle fries!!!",

As the fries are served in large bowls for sharing we ended up with three different ones: buffalo, parmesan truffle, and sweet potato. The last one was the only food item during the visit which I found to be bland, however, this was a non-issue relative to the positive experience.

    "text": "One of the best burger joints in the valley.  This is the second location I've been to, and this place continues to impress.  The burgers are fantastic and there are tons of options.  Being the extremely boring person I am, I usually just get the Classic Burger (which is still one of the best you will find anywhere).  Juicy and delicious.  The fries are also pretty good too, although I wish they gave you more in the larger size.  I've also tried their S'mores milkshake, which was decent.  They cover it with pieces of graham cracker, however, these all just sank to the bottom once we started working on it, and they were a soggy looking mess at the bottom towards the end.  I'd be interested in trying one of their other flavors though.  As with the burgers, there was great selection.  Service is also fantastic.  Someone is always looking at for you even though it's not a real 'formal' restaurant.  If you love hamburgers (and really who doesn't?) you gotta give this place a look!",

Mine was tasty and juicy, the goat cheese added some extra flavor, which made the burger well balanced. My husband really loved his burger as well, it was super juicy, which might be a little bit of a turn off for some that don't like to see that much pink on their plate, but for us it was perfect. The waitress was friendly and efficient, we sat at the bar so we were able to get full service. Overall, I would come here again.",

Then we tried both the green chili queso fries and the Parmesan garlic fries.  They were great!  We also were given the chipotle ketchup and the honey mustard which were both totally legit!  I ordered the Terlingua burger which was amazing!  The chili was on point and the Fritos sealed the deal.  My husband ordered the Goodnight burger and couldn't say enough good things....I didn't ask for a bite because I was enjoying my burger so much!  We were stuffed, but kept seeing the milkshakes go out, so we ordered the Oreo shake....Wow!  The ice cream almost seemed to have a hint of cinnamon and the Oreo pieces were sizable!  We eat pretty clean, so if we are going to have a splurge meal, we want it to be worth it....Hopdoddy is SO WORTH it!  We truly can't wait to go back and try some of the other burgers!",

My wife got the classic burger with cheese, I got the diablo burger. We shared the truffle fries and each had a beer. The food was good. My wife enjoyed her burger and I really liked the diablo as well as the truffle fries. The ordering process reminded me of the habit in that you stand in line to order, get your drink and sit down then someone brings your food. Where it differs is you then have an assigned server to bring any drinks from the bar and any condiments. Just my suggestion, but for the $40 before tip that we spent on a burger lunch I think it would make more sense to be a full service restaurant where you are seated by a host, drink and food orders taken by a server etc. I felt somewhat awkward about how much I should tip based on the level of service I received. My server was great, I tipped 20%, but would feel better about that had I received full service from stay to finish. Just my two cents.",

Excellent prices on beer and in terms of cold beer, they give twin peaks a run for their money there! Normally comes out with frosty foam on top because it is so nice and cold. Of course, the best part, their burgers. I've tried a few so far and they are all so good. Best turkey burger I've had and I normally am not the biggest fan of turkey burgers but thought I would try it out one day, not disappointed! I think it had goat cheese, and everything that was paired with it just gave it the best flavor. As for the regular beef patties, they are just so juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to try them all! Also, if you are just craving a milkshake, try them out here! Salted caramel is sooo bomb, and my husband loves red velvet, so he got the red velvet shake and he loved it! Totally worth the price. Only reason I didn't give the fifth star is because I think that their waiters still need some work. I've sat at the bar and at the regular tables, and I thought the bar had better service. Regular tables you have to catch someone walking by if you need something.",

Some of their burgers had an asterick, and if you read the tiny print, they will add up to $5 extra for a burger....I have never paid $18 for a burger, and never will! I asked the bartender if the burgers were 1/4lb or 1/2lb, and the answer was they are 7oz, but they don't look like they are almost a 1/2lb burger! The fries were seasoned, not well seasoned, but seasoned. The burger was tasteless if not for the lettuce, tomatoes, and special sauce. I had to add salt to give it some taste. What this place is really great at: MARKETING! They build it up like a new experience that will have you coming back night after night --- NOT!!! Don't waste your money here, unless you don't mind paying $$$ for small tasteless burgers!",

    "text": "This place is not your typical fast casual.  Its really caught in between being fast casual and sit down.  Its actually very confusing and that is my only complaint.  I wish they would pick what they want to be.  A hostess greets you, gives you menus, and points you in the direction of where you can order.  You can also have a seat at the bar, I think, it wasn't very obvious if that was an option.  So once you do figure out what you want, you order from in front of the open kitchen.  If you order soft drinks they give you a cup so that you can get your own from a fountain machine, if you've ordered beer or drinks they have a waiter bring it to your table.  Then another part, which I didn't like, they assign you a seat and point you in the right direction.  Very odd, why can't I pick my own?  When you sit you are met by a waiter who handles everything from there.  They bring you your drinks, your food, any condiments or extras your need.  As for the food, it was great!!  I had the Buffalo BIll, the bison burger, which was really good.  They told me how it would be prepared, medium rare and you can tell them more or less.  My wife had the Ahi tuna burger which was sushi grade tuna pan seared on each side.  Both burgers and additional topping were fresh and really put together well.  Buns are baked fresh daily and it showed, very fresh.  The best part was the truffle fries side, wow, I could eat those all day.  The soda was very crafty as well, Maine Root company sodas, well above the quality of coke or pepsi.  I would stongly suggest going during Happy Hour, which lasts until 6:30 pm on a weeknight, didn't pay attention to what other days or times it was.  You get $2 off every burger, and the basic craft beers cost only $5 (instead of $6), and you get the side of truffle fries for $5 instead of $6.95.  I will return, but the odd order/sit/eat/waiters but order at counter did throw me off.  I have to go back for the shakes, they looked pretty good, and I have to know if they live up to Shake Shake's.",

    "text": "You know how negative reviews on Yelp always start with \"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would!?\"  Well, if I could give this place a 1 billion trillion stars (the estimated number of stars in the observable universe) I would. Yes, Hopdoddy gets ALL the stars in the universe.  We stumbled upon Hopdoddy while waiting for a trendy brunch spot a few doors down in the same strip mall last weekend. Our wait for the brunch place was 'somewhere been 35 and 90 minutes' while sitting on a bench we saw Hopdoddys and decided to take a look.   I'm glad we did. The place is clean, modern, and has a really cool set up. The menu sounded delicious and the photos on Yelp proved that this place was pretty solid. They had no wait and were offering a burger and a beer for $10.  The ordering is kind of strange, you take a menu from the host, proceed to order at the counter, and a server brings you your food, any drinks from the bar, and condiments. Speaking of condiments, the options here for dipping sauces are ENDLESS- aioli, mayo, sriracha, honey mustard, chipotle ketchup, ranch, and sassy sauce. Sassy sauce is their house sauce made out of mayo and secret blend of sorcery and magic that makes it truly delicious. I recommend it. Beers are served in a large frosty chalice. Our server Glory was attentive and awesome. Made sure we never ran low on Sassy sauce.   Now the REALLY good stuff: the burgers here are phenomenal. I had the daily special which was the Chicken Fried Steak burger - two beef patties breaded and fried with horseradish mayo and house made pickles. This burger was life-changing. I have never had anything like this. Easily one of the greatest burgers ever built. I am going to start a SuperPAC, an online petition, and engage Russian hackers to help get this burger put on the menu full time. It was just THAT good. Hopdoddy management, if you are reading this, please please please but the Chicken Fried Steakburger on the menu.  I'll get your restaurant name tattooed on my body somewhere if you do, I promise!   The green chili con queso fries were insanely good, too. Word of caution, the portions for the fries here are HUGE. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, that's a very good thing.   Let's Recap: greatest burger of all time? Check. A seemingly infinite number of dipping sauces? Check. Cool, funky, modern, and clean restaurant with no wait at brunch time? Check.",

That one is on him for sure, but it was a somewhat overwhelming amount of sauce, plus I just find it odd to completely mask the flavor of the bison like that.   I got the vegan burger that \"tastes like meat\"- I don't remember what it was called. It was ok. I've wanted to try that brand of burgers for a while and I wasn't super psyched on it.  Honestly wouldn't order again at that price.  The Ahi Tuna burger is DELICIOUS even cold. The flavors all mesh incredibly well.   Decent beer selection, the staff is friendly and attentive, cool environment and full service bar.  I'll probably return to try the black bean burger.",

Another bonus, they have unique sodas at their soda fountain like Mexican cola which were all made with cane sugar. Yum!!!!",

    "text": "Great food! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. Interesting topping combinations too!   I ordered the Good Day I believe. A dollar from this burger is donated to one of Alice Cooper's charity. How could I resist?! Caramelized onions, cheddar, jalapeno, bbq sauce and a special mayo sauce too. Perfectly cooked to medium and served on a toasted brioche bun. Fries are large enough to share. We ordered them with the queso and green chiles. So good!   The only thing off putting was the presence of dogs INSIDE the restaurant. The two I saw were well behaved but one was bellied up to the bar seated on a stool! I personally love dogs so it didn't bother me but I wonder how folks with allergies would feel. Hair in your cocktails anyone?",

When I lived in LA my friends and I promised we would never go back to Hopdoddy in Playa Vista because they have horrible service at that specific location. Well I can't say that for the Camelback location. We were greeted immediately by everyone as we walked through the doors. Halley, who rung us up was the sweetest! She greeted us right away, asked if we had any questions, and gave great recommendations. Our food came out fairly quickly and the burgers and fries were delicious! Food was awesome, but Halley made our visit to Hopdoddy Burger Bar a five star experience! Thanks Halley!",

The burger had an angus beef patty, cheese, arugula, caramelized onions, truffle aoili, all the goodies to make a tasty burger.  The burger I wish was larger in size, I finished it wishing there was more.  We also got the Green Chile Queso with Fries and that was addicting.  The queso was so good I wanted to drink it out of its' container.  The fries had really nice texture, slight crisp on the outside and so perfect with the queso or even on its own, comfort food to its finest.  Would definitely come back to Hopdoddy in the future, already craving for their burgers and fries as we speak.",

Their soda selection is lovely as well with their cane sugar options instead of HFCS crap. They also have a great selection of adult beverages if you're so inclined.

They assign you a table based on your party but you get your own drinks and they bring your food out to you. My boyfriend got the Primetime and he really liked it. I got the La Bandita and it was meh. First off it was pink which I was caught off guard because it's bean and corn, the goat cheese was very powerful that is all I could taste. The patty itself just seemed bland and tasted as if there were beets in it but that wasn't on the list of ingredients? Idk. Wouldn't order it again. The sweet potato fries were good and the sauce it came with was also super good! The restaurant was clean and I will give it another shot if my boyfriend wants to eat there again but won't order the La Bandita.",

Local beer selections and chipotle ketchup options are a plus (but you can just have reg ketchup if that's your thing)  The impossible burger was awesome. I ordered it \"OG\" style because I just wanted a traditional cheese burger. They cooked it perfectly. I've been weary of vegetarian burgers because they always either 1. Fall apart on me and make a mess (always classy) or 2. like with Black bean burgers are too dense so it's like eating bread and beans. This is different, it holds together perfectly, tastes great, and isn't too heavy.   Only thing I can say is the plaza parking lot is ridiculously packed but everything in the area has crowded parking lots. Just be patient, it's worth it.",

I was having a burger craving so we figured we would swing by and got lucky. When u enter it's super cool looking but very confusing where to order. I guess my husband and I looked very confused because someone waved us towards the back. She gave us a ticket, made a joke about us being y'all, pointed to the table we were assigned and walked away.  Confused again as we were searching for a menu or better yet what to do next (seriously the setup is tricky) we finally asked the girl behind the counter \"how do we order, we've never been here\". She replied, oh I'll take your order and your ticket. Okaaayyy....\"can we have a menu please?\" Her reply, oh she didn't give you one? Umm NO! At this point I was frustrated. My husband finally said \"we've never been here before, can you tell us what to do?\"    She kindly helped us and we went to our table to wait on our food.  The next issue!  Our table what dirty! The waitress came to introduce herself and asked if we needed anything. I said yes, can you please clean off out table.  At this point it wasn't looking good and I was annoyed but hungry.    The redemption begin!  Our waitress was overall very nice, attentive and made us feel comfortable. Our food was served to us in a reasonable time and did I mention this place has a BOMB happy hour. I see why it's always so busy. $5 for starters, wine, beer and specials drinks.  I hit a glass of Raviva, a red blend that was amazing!!!   The food!!!! The fries!! Where do I begin?! The fries melted in your mouth with a crispy start. Both my husband and I burgers we agreed were the best we've had in Phoenix. The place knows how to do burger and fries like no other. Wayyy better than Shake Shack.  I really wanted to give them a better rating but they do need to work on the service. I will return soon and hope they do better.",

This place is in the hipster district and gets a lot of traffic so expect for it to be busy. Upon walking in you grab a menu and stand in line to order. Once you order grab an open seat and wait to be served.  Since this was our first time the staff took really good care of us. We had two servers who gave me the skinny on off the menu items which led to me selecting a Salted Caramel Milkshake.   **Bonus if it's your birthday you get a free shake and I mean a full sized shake**   The nice thing about going with a large party is you get to taste EVERYTHING  personally the Green Chile fries are my favorite. They have a little kick to them but it's mild and trust me you can handle it because I am a punk when it comes to spice   I got a Poblano and it was delicious. Someone else got the mushroom burger and guess what that's also delicious. I even braved the spice to take a bite of the Diablo and you guessed it DELICIOUS   this place is on point with everything and they have excellent service to match   Thank you for making my birthday meal special and amazing",

I had the Magic shroom burger and the green chile cheese fries. The burger was pretty good but the goat cheese was a little much for me and I had to take some of it off as it was overpowering the rest of my burger. Everything else about the burger was delicious and was cooked perfectly. The fries omg the fries. Crispy and full of flavor I could eat those fries everyday. The service was good as we sat at the bar around lunch time it was pretty busy but we were seen right away. The bartender was very attentive.",

We arrived right when it opened at 11 am on Sunday so it was empty but got quite busy in a few min. The staff was extremely friendly. They have their own soda which stay kinda similar to the coke brands.  The burgers were absolutely delicious. I got the Kobe prime which was super moist. We also tried their chicken burgers and their sweet potato fries were also fresh and crispy.  They do also have a bar that I believe serves beer and wine if you feel the need for a stronger beverage.   Would highly recommend this place if your in the mood for a burger. Def way better than the traditional fast food joints.",

They seated us (we requested to be seated outside) and took our drink orders and such. They also give you reusable plastic cups to get just drinking water, so you don't have to order a beverage. For ordering the food, you go to the counter yourself and order. And they'll bring out the food to your table.  I got the vegan burger. It exceeded my expectations! I don't have much experience with vegan foods, I just wanted to try something new. And the flavors and presentation of the burger was very satisfying. It was a bit messy because it was a tall burger, but that's why don't take out the toothpick! This burger was ~$8-9. We also ordered truffle/parmesan fries to share, and it was delicious!  If I had to compare I'd say a slightly fancier shake shack.  It looks like it'd be good for big groups and small groups. I'd come again if I lived nearby. I recommend!",

    "text": "This place was a nice surprise for us. We have been disappointed in the past by some of the designer burger spots in the valley, so we came to this new spot with a bit of trepidation. Would we find ourselves desperately trying to corral an underdone burger in a sloppy, quickly dissolving bun?  Would our fries increase our sodium levels to dangerous heights?  Would we find ourselves wondering why we spent a small fortune on what turned out to be a mediocre meal?  None of our fears came to pass. I had the mushroom burger called the Magic Shroom, and my wife had the prime burger. The buns passed the strength test, the burgers were cooked well with just a bit of pink, and the dipping sauces for our reasonably seasoned fries were delightful.   Not being drinkers, we can't comment on any of the brews the restaurant serves, although we were offered a sample of some beer while in line. However, we did like their sodas, which are not your typical Coca Cola or Pepsi. We found the diet drinks to be quite refreshing.  To top it all off, the price of the burgers were actually fairly reasonable. The only reason why we dropped a star is that we found the order process to be a bit odd with being assigned a table, but still having to stand in line to order.  Plus, while standing in line, we saw that our table was given to someone else, and we had to sit at a taller table, which isn't as comfortable.  That aside, we will be back. Hopefully, just like another reviewer mentioned, they will either nix the table assignment, or nix the order line so that it doesn't feel so awkward to order.",

I don't usually eat onions but when it's caramelized aside from the truffle aioli you bet I would get it. It was good not great. It got a little messy when the patty started to fall apart.

    "text": "Food was great, service and concept had major hiccups.  My friend and I decided to try out this new Hopdoddy location for lunch. It was about 11:45 on a Thursday, and we only had about 45 minutes for lunch before we had to travel back to work. Unfortunately, it ended up being the slowest service, unprofessional servers, and most frustrating dining experience I've had in a while. It took a total of an hour and fifteen minutes to get out of there, after we waited for over 45 minutes to get our food.    Generally, the concept just wasn't working efficiency-wise from the moment we walked in. We walked in & two minutes later an employee taps us on the back and says \"OH where did you come from I didn't see you walk in\" and hands us more menus, even though we had already grabbed some while we were waiting in line.  After ordering, they place us at an unfavorable 2-top table by the line & Soda machine. I think in restaurant setting like that you should be able to have a say in where you sit, but the choose for you. We asked if we could switch our table to a friendlier one, given half of the tables were empty at the time. They gladly let us move to another one. 35 Minutes later, we still don't have any food or milkshakes. We asked numerous workers if they knew where our food or milkshakes were, they all said they don't know and the \"bar handles that\".    10 minutes later, it appeared no one had looked into anything, and we had to ask another server who had an unfriendly response of, \"you didn't order through the cashier because we don't see your order. Are you sure you ordered. and are you sure you ordered milkshakes?\" instead of an apology or appropriate response of trying to figure it out.  10 minutes after that, we received our food, which was actually GREAT. We ordered the spinach salad and Thunderbird burger. Both were very tasty. 15 minutes later we still had no milkshakes. Finally we received a milkshake, and then it took another 20 minutes and numerous times of asking servers to get our check.   I understand it's a new opening, and therefore I would wait a few months to try it again. Their food was great and I'm sure this was not a normal experience.",

It is a very confusing experience if you have never been here.  You don't know what to do. Do I go the counter and order or do I sit down like a regular restaurant? We were told to order at the counter so we did.  We ordered but could not pay and were told what table to sit at and that we would have full service after that.  So we sat down.  A girl came over and said she would be helping us but that was the last we saw of her until we needed our bill.  We had to get everything for ourselves drinks, etc.  I don't understand how this is full service if you didn't do anything for us.  Once she brought our bill we had to go up the bar to pay because we didn't see her again.  Why make it confusing for the customers?  Why can't we just sit down and you take our order?  I will eat here again just because the food was really good.",

Second:  the milkshakes are not made with ice cream... they are made from a \"machine\" with some sort of powdered mixes??? that was not made clear.    the worst part of this first time and last time visit - the staff absolutely would NOT stop bothering me and my party.  At least 4 different people came up over 6 separate times to see how things were, to pick up plates that were not ready to be picked up, to just chat???, to introduce themselves, to see if the check was ready.  I felt like I was having more conversation with the different staff rather than my friend.  It was very annoying to be interrupted so many times.  I finally just stopped talking and let my companion field all the comments and questions. good grief.  They do have out door seating .  We did not go up and stand in line, so a wait person did bring us drinks and food.  So now I know.",

What a pleasant surprise to find out Hopdoddy not only was there but easily accessible in Phoenix! As proud Texans, we can say the Phoenix location lives up to the Hopdoddy name.

My boyfriend and I came here when they had their beer and burger for $10 promo, which was a steal considering we got 2 of the more expensive choices. Who doesn't like a deal that makes your meal cheaper and comes with beer...haters (of course) lol. We got the primetime, the Buffalo Bill burger with truffle fries and 2 draft beers. The primetime was to die for, I finished my half before I took the first bite. The creaminess of the  brie (I love brie) just went so well with the tender akashi beef. The Buffalo Bill was a little disappointing, because the whole burger was overwhelmed by the hot sauce you couldn't really even taste anything else. I substituted the blue cheese for goat cheese which cut down on the saltiness caused by the hot sauce, but it wasn't enough. Sad really, because buffalo is delicious. The fries were good, not extraordinary nor poor, but a little pricey. The nutella pretzel shake which I trying to avoid, because calories you know, was fantastic. I would just give in and order one. I like that it was rich and creamy but not overly sweet to the point where you think you'll get a cavity. And the pretzels add that salty crunch that really contrasts with the creamy chocolate sensation. Will definately be back to try some of their seasonal offerings as well as that lamb burger.",

You walk in and order at the kitchen window, which was a little jarring at first because it was not busy and we had never been there, so as we took some time to look at the menu it felt like the entire cook line was watching us. We didn't like that so much, but the wait staff was very friendly about it. They assign you a table at the time you order, and you don't have to pay until after your meal.

Fries were great (is there cinnamon in the chili? tasty), Thunderbird was juicy and delicious, and the Greek was good until reaching the middle... where it was WAY too rare (we showed our server). Weren't expecting it, but they took the Greek off the bill. Didn't have any beer (gasp!), but the vanilla shake was tasty. Even with the misfire on the lamb patty, we'll definitely be going back.",

I walked in prior to them opening however the door was unlocked so I assumed they were open. I sit down at the bar and the bartender says \"we're not officially open but we'll serve you it just might not be as professional\" I would have preferred a different choice of words--or lock the door until you're ready to open. A waiter interrupted her and said he'd take care of me. My meal came and it was incorrect however they fixed it right away,  Parmesan truffle fries could've been at least room temperature especially being 1 of 2 customers in the restaurant so they have the potential to be amazing (based upon other reviewers), burger was cool nothing spectacular but good to know no hormones in the beef, and fantastic milkshake! This is more like an \"upscale\" smashburger with full service bar/happy hour, and occasional check in by several different servers. M Average priced for the area $22 for fries burger and milkshake",

We arrived at noon on a Sunday and it was 2/3 full. Good sign. We came here on a recommendation from a chef, so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed.   You approach the counter and place your order and then you are assigned a table. They have a seasonal menu so I got the Llana Poblano Burger, with pepper jack and big pieces of roasted poblano on a freshly baked bun. My son got the Buffalo Bill with bison, bacon, Bleu Cheese and hot sauces, which was my second choice. We each ordered fries too.   Our beers (huge) arrived in short order and Meagan took good care of us. Our lunch arrived 8 mins later. What excellent burgers!  Rich flavor, good balance of sauce-to-veggie-to-meat ratio. The fresh bun. Yum. The fries were cooked with spices that took them over the top.   I can't wait for a return visit.",

    "text": "I have been reluctant to try Hopdoddy because it seems like every week there is a new burger spot to try. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  Upon arriving, the restaurant is a bit confusing. When I walked in, there wasn't a hostess and I also didn't have a clear view of the walk-up counter. After standing confused for a minute or two, a staffer walked me up to the counter to order. What's even more strange - you don't pay at the counter. You're seated and a waitress will bring food, order extras, bring additional drinks, etc. So I'm not sure the purpose of the ordering style, but I'm willing to let it go.  The burger was solid. Very juicy with great seasoning and fresh ingredients. I was also impressed with the bar. I have low expectations when it comes to these bars - I usually expect a Red Robin type bar with pre-made cocktails and a small selection of beer. Hopdoddy hit a home run here.    I ordered a watermelon mojito, which was made right in front of me. It was fresh and tasty. The perfect summer drink! They also have local craft beers - and not just the Four Peaks Kiltlifter.  My girlfriend doesn't drink, but she was very impressed with their sodas. Apparently they are handmade using cane sugar. Very cool!  Overall, a good spot for drinks and a burger. It stands out among a valley full of similar restaurants.",

It was cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  The bun was nice and fresh.  It all went great together.  I also had regular fries and sweet potato fries with chile con queso.  Both of them were excellent.  I wouldn't crown them as the best burger in AZ but they are definitely in the upper echelon.  10-13 bucks a burger al a carte isn't cheap but you are not getting a burger this good for much less out there.

It's one of those \"order at the counter\" places which I'm not a fan of but at least they brought the food out to us. The burger was thick and cooked nicely and the \"sassy sauce\" was tasty - not quite a thousand island sauce but it really complimented my burger. I also ordered their local cider selection on tap and it came in a giant frozen goblet and was a bit frozen itself.  The counter said the burgers would have a slight pink middle instead of asking how we liked them but both ours were cooked totally through, which is fine with me. The side of fries was just meh - I'm not a fan of shoestring fries and the seasoning was a bit much. The burger would have been fine and plenty without them. Overall, a decent place - but since I'm not local anymore, not sure if I'd go out of my way for it.",

I know some people seem to dislike the odd ordering structure they have, but I think the food is well worth the irregular set-up. Just a bit of an overview: You walk in, grab a menu, go to the counter where you order and get assigned a table, then you go to your table. From there everything is structured like a normal restaurant, you can order more food, your food is delivered to your table, and your server brings you your check. Honestly, it seems to be an unnecessarily complicated system, but once you go through the process once it isn't that annoying.   Back to why I love this place-THE HAPPY HOUR! From 3pm-6:30pm Monday-Friday all of their cocktails(plus other drinks), fries, and seasonal hamburgers are $5! I love it because it makes me be more adventurous and try out some of the seasonal burgers that I otherwise might have missed out on.

They put you in line to order and it takes forever because they NEVER have more than one cashier/order taker.  Doesn't matter if there's 20 people in line.  Two groups in front of us today still took 25 minutes to order because they all decided to pay individually - why make the whole restaurant wait for 6 people to basically split a check and run credit cards one at a time?  So after standing in line for 25 minutes, you are reminded to tip and it's full service but it couldn't be further from the truth.  You get your own condiments, drinks and refills and you pay before you get your service... Nothing at this restaurant makes any sense and for $55 for burgers for a family of 4, I would expect a lot better service.  If it weren't for the limited availability of a good impossible burger I would have just not written anything and never returned.",

We shared an order of the truffle fries.  It was very good.  Burgers were juicy not dry.  Food was HOT when I came to the table.  NICE!",

    "text": "There must be a foodie-millennial term for trendy. What ever that term is, fill it on as a descriptor of this place.  I'm greeted by a youthful woman who introduces me to another who hands me a menu and we discuss the food items for a few minutes while standing  in front of the order counter where I was introduced to Alex (another youthful woman) who took my order and pointed me to table 54 - I found it - after filling my own soda.  My server introduced herself. And asked if there is anything I needed -catchup. Before my server brought my catchup another youthful woman (not my server) delivered my order. Then came the catchup. Great!  While munching my burger, I amused myself by observing the activities of the staff. All twenty-ish. Lots of swagger, lots of acne. It's early, but there are at least three staff members for every customer and they are eagerly swaggering around trying very hard to maintain their hipster-ness (I guess).   I get that attitude is what sells these days and that if I have to ask the difference between a Kennebec potato and a, say, Russet ... well I don't deserve an answer. As we oldsters might say, \"PULEEASE!\"  Oh the food. Burger was yummmy. Juicy. Fresh. All as promised. Hand-cut Kennebec fries, well, tasted like fresh  French fries. I liked the Mexican diet cola - not chemical tasting, refreshing.  I know that this is some sort of \"chain\" and I'm sure they have a formula ... if they're still in business  at this location in a year, I might try it again.",

I got the truffle Parmesan fries which were amazing, but you could get the plain fries and be very satisfied since they have all the great sauces.

    "text": "The $10 (and above) burger is commonplace in brew pubs and concept restaurants these days.  That doesn't mean the burger should be 10 bucks or eaters should put up with 'em. HopDaddy is the latest, clearest example.  We went on a Wednesday night, right before the rush of diners.   I ordered the prime time, the missus the s'hroom burger. I was told the PT is served medium rare and was asked if I'm OK with it. Great. What came out was a soggy, well-done burger -- did they keep the patty in a steamer, like some fast-food joint? -- that was flavorless.  The missus' burger was better but also overcooked.  The bun is just not right -- it's way too soft and weak -- for a burger.  The fries and beers are the best thing about our visit, although you have to wonder about $5 for a side of fries and $6 for draft beer served in a margarita glass (well short of a pint).  Lastly, and it's not a small point, the concept of HopDaddy seems like an afterthought. It's poorly thought out and executed: you ordered on your own, then once seated, get \"full wait service\"? The wait staff provides no insight or service, save asking whether we needed anything else with our naked fries (yes, ketchup is upon request and served in small paper thimbles, just like McDonald's) and bringing the check.  One might drop in for a brew if shopping in the area. Else there are many more options for a better burger experience.",

The burgers are all made with the freshest and highest quality ingredients and then cooked to perfection! You'll actually be able to taste the difference and then you'll wonder why you haven't eaten here before or why you've ever wasted time with any other burger place. Oh, and let's not forget about their fries! I swear the special seasoning in their fries is crack, because they are SO addictive! My gorgeous date and I shared a large fries and it was PLENTY! They also have a chipotle ketchup that was to die for!   If you've never been here, you owe it to yourself and your taste buds to stop by and sample some of the best burgers ever made! I recommend the El Diablo burger- it was perfection!",

    "text": "Been here twice. First time was good, second time was terrible. I won't be back.  Found this place back in March only because we parked on the north end of Town and Country to get to Pizza Bianco. Saw it, figured it was worth a shot as it was happy hour.  Worst thing you can hear when walking into any restaurant is \"Have you been here before\" and/or \"do you know how it works.\"   If the answer is anything other than \"sit your ass down, we'll take your order and bring you food and drink like every other normal restaurant,\" then chances are you're in a pretentious hipster hellhole and are going to have a bad time. Take a wild guess which realm Hopdoddy falls into... As if the douchetacular name isn't enough of an indication.   Thankfully, you can dodge this off-putting bullet by sitting at the bar, which we did. Normal service here.   First time, ordered the Buffalo Bill (medium) and fries, along with a beer and some sort of cocktail with a hip and \"clever\" name. Burger was surprisingly solid, one of the best I've had in restaurant. I rarely ever order burgers because they always disappoint compared to what I make on the grille. This one was great, and came cooked as asked. Fries were ultra-salty, and over seasoned. Pass on these, especially since they are an upcharge.   Beer list is typical AZ swill; nothing really good, but goes with their mission of being hip by sourcing local crap.   Service was pretty good on the first visit. Attentive bartender that was friendly.  Second visit, not so much. Place was practically dead during Friday happy hour, a far cry from how busy it was a few months prior. Sat at the bar, and had to deal with one of the worst bartenders ever. Aside from the fact that she looked like she just woke up seconds before we walked in, she was the polar opposite of the guy I had on my first visit.   And the burger this time was horrible. It was something made out of prime rib, ordered medium. Showed up closer to rare than medium rare. Bun was sopping wet with juice, sure sign that these are not cooked at a high enough temp, made far ahead of time, and likely frozen. No bueno.   The happy hour isn't anything special, and if the service and food are this hit and miss, then why bother? Plenty of other places that do it right and do it better.",

I'm not much of a burger person, I ordered their Continental club and it is to die for!!! It was a perfect combination of turkey avocado.  Truffle fries, I highly suggest. You will average spend about $15 but again, worth it. Treat yo self.   Also. Go during happy hour! Ive been back a few times for HH and Kirstin takes great care of us.   Love coming here whem I crave a good burger or just a drink!  Definitely a fun environment for a group",

    "text": "There's so much of this place I don't understand, and so much I don't like, I'll  just start at the beginning.   First, the name.  What's up with the name?  Hop is of course a beer reference. The sissy\" thing is...odd.  Made up.  I know 50's slang, and \"doddy\" is NOT one I've EVER heard.  Could be, but I don't think so. I thought they just made it up.  I've heard, \"daddy\" and \"daddy-o\", but never \"doddy\".  Server didn't know, either.  So they've go that going for them.  Oh wait. It's on the menu, it turns out It's the name of someone's pet cow.  I SWEAR TO GOD.  So now, I'm eating someone's pet cow?!?!!  Which is hardly a good name for a restaurant. And a stupid stretch. What's really funny is, the server, an employee of this restaurant did not know. But what's up with this?  Who thought this through originally?  Answer: no one.   Second, I hate it when you enter a restaurant and they ask you if you've been there before. Because why?  Why would it matter?  Loyalty points?  Not here.  It's not as bad as loudly asking a single diner, \"jUST ONE?\"  But it's close.  Well, here they ask you that because, even though they do have servers, you STILL have to go to the counter to place your order.  The server then will bring you your order.  Why \"half-a-server\"?  Doesn't improve service, doesn't do anything, near as I can tell.  And it's confusing.  And the server still wants to be tipped like a whole server.  Half-strange.  Somebody with too much time thought that one up and believe me, it's not going to catch on.  Third, the food.  The burger was bland.  Very bland.  Dry, too.  Not juicy at all.  Beef is too lean. Look, \"juicy is greasy, greasy is juicy\", and this was neither.  In spades.  VERY BLAND.  Not well-seasoned either.  More an effort to eat than enjoyable.  But worse and odder stil(!) was the onion.  My \"classic\" burger was lettuce. tomato, onion, I added bacon and cheese and \"sassy sauce\" on the side.  When the burger arrived, the onion was perfectly spilling out of the side of the burger.  Except it wasn't.    It wasn't a slice of onion at all: it was a SINGLE RING of and onion, (truth be told, it was 3/4 of a ring of the onion),  placed along the outside of the burger.  Which would have been great if we were TAKING PHOTOS of the burger, but this burger was to EAT!  I don't get it.  I believe that onion as a topping on the burger, in this country, means a SLICE OF ONION.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And unlike the name of the establishment or the 1/2 style of service they offer, a single onion ring isn't choice or cute.  It's amateurish, unprofessional, cheap or all the above.  Oh, wait: it's Instagram!  \"We'll design a burger MADE TO PHOTOGRAPHED!  Taste-schmaste!!  Just make it look good!  But what i wanted is flavor. Just flavor.   I even commented to the snooty waiter, before the Instagram connection had been made in my head, \"this would all be perfect, the onion spilling out, would be perfect IF WE WERE PHOTOGRAPHING THE DAMN THING!  BUT I CAME HERE TO EAT!\"   The truffle fries were good, not great, NOT a huge portion and $7/copy, if I were coming back, I'd forgo the fries.  Too pricey.  And that's the point.  I'm not getting the fries on my next visit because there will be no next visit, I'm NOT coming back.  Half a restaurant.  Half a flavor.  Half the service.  Less than half an onion.  Twice the price.  The list, my list,  BEST BURGER IN PHOENIX: * Lucky Boy * Zin Burger * Freddy's Steakburgers  **Last on the List: HopDoddy",

We were sat at the bar for a to go meal cause we wanted to have takeout.  The bartender, didn't catch her name but she had reddish brown hair. My husband said can I have a coors light and she quickly said, no...   Nothing else, just no. I think she was trying to make a joke. That's not funny to me I find that unprofessional actually. I have been a bartender and a server for many years and I understand the struggle. Although, I don't appreciate sarcasm from a stranger when I am paying them money....or at all really.  We looked at her like, are you going to tell us why?   Then we paused and waited about half a minute.  She then says, we don't have it as she is laughing.  Ok... so she recommends something else but doesn't seem like she even knows what she is talking about. While she is recommending something she is clanking two beer glasses together... WHY ? She keeps doing this the entire time we are talking. Why!!!?  My husband felt so uncomfortable cause she was acting so weird. I don't really know what else they were talking about cause I was waiting for it to be over so we could leave.  I told him I wanted to leave and when we got outside he was like thankyou, I did not want to eat there she gave me such bad vibes, I was like I know right!!  $12 a burger.. nope.   Went to Whole Foods and got a sandwich for $9.   Hop daddy's might be good ? We will never know cause we didn't stay to eat and I don't want to go back.   You guys should get a new bartender.",

Though I'm not a big fan of thin cut fries because restaurants that serve these tend to overcook them, the Kennebec fries I got as a side were  very good: crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Before coming here, I looked at the beer list on the website of their Scottsdale location and made my choice; unfortunately this Phoenix location has a different list, so I chose a different brew than what I was hoping to get. Hopefully they'll eventually follow the Scottsdale location's example and print a beer list that indicates the ABV (alcohol by volume) and IBU (International Bitterness Units); I find that helpful in making a choice of brew for ordering. Atmosphere is very casual and service is fast and friendly. The Town and Country location means that this burger bar is easy to find and get to, and parking will never be a problem.",

    "text": "I've been to Hopdoddy in Austin so I was thrilled to see that one opened in Phoenix! Unfortunately, this location has just entered my Yelp Hall of Shame for serving me one of the WORST meals I have ever had in my entire life.   I love cheeseburgers. Like seriously LOVE them. I eat them all the time, from the highest of the high end to the lowest of the low. My burger here was absolutely disgusting. I ordered the regular ground beef burger but I swear my burger was so poorly cooked that it had the consistency and texture of my aunt's nasty meatloaf that everybody HATED eating at family potluck dinners. Even the damn dog wouldn't touch her meatloaf, and this burger reminded me of that. It was almost as if the patty had been previously frozen and microwaved or mixed with something -- I don't know, but it wasn't right and it was super gross.   Even worse, I ordered my burger medium well and it came out practically raw in the middle. The photos don't make it look as raw as it was in the middle. I also paid to add on \"super crispy\" bacon, and it was flabby and sad and chewy and nasty.   I spent the majority of my meal sitting there seething about how unhappy I was with my burger. Why didn't I complain? Well, first, nobody ever came over to ask how our meal was and second, the place was packed and I didn't want to wait in a long line just to complain. I don't like to complain either and I rarely do, but I had to write this review to save others a similar letdown. Avoid.",

Not only are their burgers delicious, their happy hour is one of my favorites and their service is always on point and friendly. They have a $5 burger on HH that rotates each month. This month, it's was their Brew burger topped with a mac and cheese patty on top of many other things..did I mention FIVE DOLLARS?! I wasn't even planning on ordering food, but I couldn't turn the deal down. To add to that, almost all of their drinks are also 5$ on HH including this delicious frozen margarita complimented with a refreshing corona. The atmosphere is great and this is definitely one of my go-to joints for happy hour or a tasty burger. If I could change one thing, I wish the non HH burgers were slightly cheaper...though tasty they can appear smaller than the average. But over all..MUST TRY BURGER BAR",

It is clean, and with ample huge windows, it makes for a bright atmosphere. There is ample indoor seating, and outdoor seating on their patio, if you prefer to dine alfresco. We were greeted with huge smiles as we entered, and since it was our first time in, the hostess took time to explain how things work. We looked over the menu, and found a table. The menu has a variety of different burgers made with organic angus beef, and topped with fresh ingredients. There is also a choice of ahi tuna burger, turkey burger, and even a vegetarian burger! There are sides, drinks, milkshakes, and salads. I chose the classic burger, they asked me if a ribbon of pink in the burger would be okay. I said yes. My burger was cooked perfectly, and was topped with a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, onion, and sassy sauce (don't worry it is not at all hot). I opted to have cheddar cheese added to my burger. The burger is served on a toasted bun, and was delicious!! My husband and I ordered some fries to share. We ordered the regular fries, and they were thin, crispy and not at all greasy! They have a wide variety of natural sodas. We were going to try a salted caramel Oreo shake, but after our burgers and fries, we were stuffed, so that will be something to try next time for sure!   The decor inside is modern, upscale funky. You can bet I will be back to Hopdoddy when I am in the area to try a different burger, and one of their signature milkshakes!  Bravo for the great experience Hopdoddy!",

    "text": "Wow! Just wow! I tried to think of even one thing negative but couldn't come up with anything. That's how good this place is!  Upon walking in we were greeted immediately. We were told to look over the menu, order at the register and they would tell us which table to sit at.  I ordered the shroom burger and got it as is... delicious! Juicy, tasty and seasoned wonderfully. The aioli sauce was a great addition to this burger.  Hubby ordered the Buffalo bill as is and he thought it was extremely tasty. Sassy sauce was good on it also.  Daughter ordered the impossible burger (plant based) and we were all happily surprised by how delicious this \"burger\" was! That will definitely be ordered again!  It was very moist and the seasonings were fantastic.  We shared a large sweet potato fry which was plenty for the 3 of us. These were crispy and yummy.  The soda is a brand I've not heard of (Maine Root and Mexican Soda). I tried the diet with black cherry and that was good.  Meat is ground on site every day so it's always fresh which may contribute to the wonderful taste. Also no antibiotics or hormones in the meat and the condiments don't have any high fructose corn syrup and you can tell the difference.  A server came to our table a few times to check on us, fill up drinks and take away trays. All the time friendly and answering my questions (what's in the impossible burger-plant base with hem?, can we buy them for home-no they are made fresh daily, or questions about other menu items).  I would definitely recommend this place and the little higher price is worth the deliciousness, freshness and overall nice vibe of the place.",

This chain originated in Austin back in 2010 and has spread with plenty of support and plans to continue their expansion, mainly west from the point of origin.  I just think they are so basic! It's kewl that there is a $5 burger of the day,  but In-n-Out is right next door, and sometimes they put some questionable items as the \"deal.\"   Their beer is simply overpriced as major competition in the area can attest to. I think they had the idea this was going to be lie their Scottsdale location. Whole Foods might be near by, but even that store is more reasonably priced then it's Scottsdale counterpart.   I would say their meat's calibur is on par with Smash Burger, but with Applebee's prices. It was a bit awkward in their as well. Most of the staff was robotic and it didnt feel personable at all. I don't plan on being a repeat customer if they aren't able to step up and perform at an acceptable level of quality.   3 stars. You know this some somewhat helpful!",

There was 6 people in our party and everyone enjoyed their meal. People came by to see if everything was OK and to refill our drinks. My grandson had been there before and made a friend to one on the waitresses. She stopped by and they talked about action figures. My grandson is 5.

    "text": "Hopdoddy's a decent place. They offer wonderful farm-to-table food and surprisingly fresh in the thick of hot Phoenix weather. Their style is a little hard to grasp at first especially for newcomers to the establishment, though. Read on!  So when you first walk in, you walk into the bar. There's a sign with menus that you're supposed to pick up from. Sort of like Panera, Paradise Bakery, those kinda places where you order first, then sit down? Yeah, this place does that. Except the menus are in a stand that you pick up individually from, it's not on some big board like at those other places. So that's a little unusual. SOMETIMES there's an employee that hands out the menus, but more often than not there isn't. Again, unusual.  OK, whatever, so you order your food at the counter. I get the \"Good night good cause\" burger which is a combination of \"Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Jalapenos, Hickory BBQ, Sassy Sauce\" as described on their website at the time of this review. It's good, and at the time of this review is $8.50 a burger. Sounds pricey right? Their other burgers are even pricier.  What gets weird for me here is that there's a line to tip if you pay with a card, but since you haven't gotten actual service other than having your order taken, how do you know what tip to give? So I just default to 20% as a minimum out of respect. If the server deserves more after, I don't know if I'm supposed to leave a tip at the table or go up to the counter again?   Anyway, so then you sit down a table of your choosing. Each table has a number, but nowhere on your receipt is a table number listed, so I think the table numbering is more for some internal business process unique to Hopdoddy that doesn't have much value to the customer. Like I said, unusual.  Unusual stuff aside, let's talk about the food!  The food is fucking fantastic. The \"Good night good cause\" burger is a spicy, salty, savory delicious burger that gets pretty damn messy with meat juices real fast. Not surprisingly, every table at Hopdoddy has self-service paper towels for customers, sort of like at BBQ places.  If you haven't figured out already, Hopdoddy somehow integrates different restaurant styles, like the paper towels at a BBQ place, the self service menus of Panera, showing the bar first thing at you when you walk in etc etc. Somehow, that integration clusterfuck of different ideas works here. So truck on, Hopdoddy, you got something good going on, keep at it.  The beer selection is great, but what really makes this place shine on the drinks side is actually their \"soda\" bar, which is a wide variety of homemade root beers, such as orange root beer, blueberry root beer. This isn't some cheap, shitty Coke multi-touchscreen soda machine, it's old school, almost retro-fitted looking machine (look, we're in central Phoenix, if you're not here for hipster food/drink experiences, you're in the wrong city). Anyway, the soda is just as fantastic as the food, it stands out as something you probably have never had before.  All in all, this is probably one of the few places I am going to miss about Phoenix when I move away to Los Angeles. Just wanted to ensure I got this review in before my departure. For central Phoenicians old and new, this place is worth a trip!",

    "text": "\"You know what the valley really needs?  Another burger joint\" - no one ever.  I'm not picking on Hopdoddy I promise, but c'mon we know the valley is as oversaturated with burger joints as we are with pizza joints, taco stands, and coffee shops.  But being the devoted and resolutely curious Yelper foodie I am, I can't let a new buzz-generating joint escape my view (even if it is just a burger joint).  I've actually missed numerous opportunities to try Hopdoddy in the past (including their original location in Austin years back), but my Dad asked for a burger joint to meet up at for dinner.  So on early Saturday evening, Hopdoddy it was.  Hopdoddy is pretty hard to miss in the Town & Shopping shopping complex.  On the southeast corner of 20th Street & Camelback, Hopdoddy's Phoenix location pretty demonstrably stands out from the old red tile roof row structures next door.  Hopdoddy's two story window encased structure is an odd mix with the rest of the plaza, but the laid back atmosphere inside will quickly disarm the confused.  The ordering process here is a little different than other burger joints however.  Here you're handed a menu, study it while waiting in line and then order at the register.  Being that there was no line Saturday at 5pm, my Dad and I had to act quickly.  Fortunately it didn't take me long to land on my preferred meal of the night.  First, the burger.  In this case the appropriately named Primetime Burger.  American Kobe style beef, brie cheese, caramelized onions, truffle aioli, steak sauce, arugula and tomato.  Yelpers also raved about the truffle fries so I split a large order of those with my Dad.  And because I'm a sucker for shakes, gotta have one of those.  I had a delicious salted caramel milk shake at The Stand in Arcadia not long ago I figured I'd see how Hopdoddy's compares.  Total cost for my food, shake and tax came to about $28 and was all brought to our table in just under 5 minutes.  The salted caramel shake here was solid, though not quite as rich and creamy as The Stand's version.  Still, a perfectly good shake I can recommend.  The truffle fries came out in a huge portion and liberally doused with parmesan cheese.  The aioli coating was present but not overwhelming which I appreciated.  As for the burger, it was good (especially liked the fresh baked bun), but the sandwich itself didn't blow me away.  I think it was probably the brie cheese that threw me off a bit on this one.  I might've gone with cheddar, blue cheese, or even mozzarella as a substitute.  The burger itself was great and the onions and steak sauce were excellent accompaniments.  So not perfect, but a really good overall first experience at Hopdoddy.  Given their commitment to fresh made bread, scratch made sauces, and keeping hormones and antibiotics out of the beef, I can understand why this Austin born burger chain has taken off.  And for you veggie lovers out there, there are salads as well as a black bean burger option.  Is Hopdoddy good enough to stand up the mountain of burger competitors in the valley?  Time will tell.  But I thinks it safe to say we'll be seeing more Hopdoddy locations popping up in the valley before long.",

Our server went above and beyond and fulfilled our needs ahead of time; we never wanted or had to ask for anything. It was awesome because everyone at the table commented on how exceptional the service was. How often do you hear that?  Twyla and I have been here several times and have enjoyed each visit. The range of burgers that are offered is lengthy and the gluten free options FN rock for my Celiac girl. I have to take care of my gem. Our food was cooked to the proper temps and the buns on our burgers were as soft as a baby's _ _ _ (hangman) or a Charmin roll on your tush. The Truffle Fries bring me back to my San Francisco trip. Napa too. I love truffle fries.   It is located in a hub of activity. There is nothing you could want for: movies, shopping, eye candy, plastic personalities, coffee shops and I'm sure there must be a massage place close by too. I highly recommend it!  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

    "text": "Okay, Hopdoddy, this is starting to sound like a love/hate relationship.  I still love you, but we've got some issues.  First up, \"Medium Rare\"  When I order a burger medium rare it's okay for the cashier to confirm, as in, \"you like that with a warm, red center, right?\"  Yes, that is okay.  But when she asks a second time within seconds, you want a warm, red center, right?  Listen, I want it medium rare.  If somehow you think I am deviating from the standard definition, you are wrong.  Next, you deliver my burger and repeat, \"warm, red center\".  FFS already.  This tells me that either you don't trust me to know what medium rare is, you staff doesn't know what medium rare is, and for damn sure when the burger is delivered medium-well, your chef doesn't know what medium rare is.  Or, warm, red center for that matter.  So somebody needs to get a clue, and it's not me.  Second up, we requested a second order of your delicious Kennebec Fries from the server.  Eventually, he dropped off a ticket for this and said, \"just pay me when you are ready\".  We waited for like ten minutes for him to come back by, and I finally got tired of waiting, and went to the cashier.  Now the cashier cannot take my money, she has to go track down the server to have him take my money.  There's a flaw in that process if you have to track down a disappearing server to pay for your ticket.  Apart from that, my medium-well, warm, red center burger was just as fresh and tasty as usual.",

    "text": "Last night in Phoenix and I wanted a burger, wife wanted a salad. Hopdoddy was close to the Biltmore, so we tried it out.  I chose this place because the environment looked laid back, food looked good in pics, and I had to get some of that soda fountain with that Mexicane Coke.   Like usual, I didn't expect much because most places let me down. We had pretty good luck with the food in Phoenix though, and this place was good. I read other reviews, some good and some bad, so I try to base what I'd like off pictures.  Wife got the Cesar salad and she loved it. I got the regular burger and added bacon and cheese. I didn't want to go with someone too fancy because I wanted to taste the Angus beef they advertise. I also got the chili cheese fries, which I never get because we're not a big fan of them usually, but the description with the cheese and sour cream sold me. The chili was light, all meat I think, and the freshly sliced jalapenos were a nice touch. We loved them.  So the burger...it came out and I was shocked at how beautiful it looked. Now THAT'S how you serve a burger. I've never seen a burger that looked like it was from an advertisement. So I bit into this thing and the meat itself tasted SO good. The blood and juices dripped off. The bacon was cooked perfect for me. The only gripe I had was the onion. It was raw, which I don't mind, but I got those stringy pieces that you can't easily bite through. They kept getting stuck and I'd pull an entire slice out because it wouldn't break. Next time I'll ask for grilled onions.  Like others I find the tipping ahead of time odd. I wish you could just pay after. I went up later to get a shake and they told me to just go sit back down and they'd bring it with a bill...I didn't even get to the counter yet.  So when we ordered it was almost $30 the first time and it was awkward but I tipped a $1.00 because the cashier was helpful, and I planned to tip at the table. But as I went to my table I felt guilty, but I wasn't going to tip a lot BEFORE service. What if the food sucked and service was terrible. The half on half off service is a little weird. One girl offered to refill my drink, but I was trying different flavors so I said I'd do it. When the shake came we got a new bill so I just tipped 100%  on that bill.   The main takeaway, the burgers are delicious and I was happy to find out we have two in SoCal, although 45 mins away (15 miles or so but traffic!)  This capped off a great trip to a city I'm looking to possibly move to.",

Great happy hour from 3-7 and they are doing an AMAZING deal through the end of October that gets you any burger and any local draft beer for only $10. No time restrictions on that deal, open to close!  I had the Ahi Tuna Burger today: sushi grade tuna, sunflower sprouts, nori chips, teriyaki, honey wasabi, mayo, pickled ginger, red leaf lettuce, white onion and beefsteak tomato. This is a sushi lovers wet dream; dive in!  Staff is super friendly and very helpful if it's your first time in. (They have counter service or full service at the bar.) They are honest and knowledgeable about everything on the menu allowing you to order with confidence.  I've sat at the bar a few times w/ Mike behind it; he's the type of bartender I would want working at my family's restaurant.  If you want to get out of the house to get a great burger (or salad) but still want that neighborhood feel, this is the place.  Cheers!",

    "text": "Interesting concept that I am not sure about how successful it will be.  You walk in and are immediately directed to go to the counter where you order your food.  Then you self serve your soft drinks like soda and water, then a hostess takes you to your table.  There a waiter introduces themselves and says they will be serving you the rest of the way, but a food runner brings your food.  All that waiter brings you are your cocktails, beer, or milkshake, and hamburger condiments, and then you pay that person.  The whole thing felt off to me, disjointed, I just don't get it.  They are missing opportunity to seriously make more money for instance.  As a suggestion, take me to my table, and give me a knowledgeable waiter who can tell me about the menu, bring me a cocktail or beer to get things going, let me soak in all the Tv's and cool vibe, and then I will order my burger.  Speaking of the food, the hamburger was 4 star excellent, perfectly cooked, excellent cuts of meat in the ground beef mix, the bun perfectly toasted, and lots of different burgers to choose from.  Now the bad, which were the horrible french fries, which I sent back due to being cool, not crunchy, and coated with some fake crap that was horrible.  Can't they just hand cut a real potato and fry it well.  My replacement fries were just as bad as the first one.  So why this was a roller coaster of confusion, and the only thing good was the burger and the beer, I give it 2.5 half stars.",

It's not clearly marked where you need to go, but the servers are really helpful if you're not sure about where to go.  Chose to get the Buffalo Bill burger and an order of fries, which came out to be about 15 dollars for a take out order. A little bit pricey, but the burger was really big and the order of fries was too much for just one person at a reasonable price for a higher end burger place. The fries were really good, well seasoned and with good flavor. The Buffalo Bill burger, which was a bison burger, was a little too smoky for my taste, but still enjoyable and worth trying. They have a lot of other interesting sounding burgers on their menu as well, which is what I would want to try the next time I'm here.",

I had a couple of beers and an appetizer and though it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special. My second visit I had the El Diablo burger and a couple of cocktails. Both were quite good, but again the staff did not at all seem like they wanted to be there, no smiles, fairly inattentive. I had opportunity to mention this to a manager and was accused by them of seeming annoyed, which was exceptionally odd.   Overall, there's really nothing that would cause me to return.

I got a gluten free bun (extra $1.50) it was decent but not the highlight I would get the fresh baked bun next time and suffer a bit lol. Fries were fresh but just ok too skinny for me but they were real potato so that's good. Best thing was the ginger lemonade it was gingeeeery I loved it but no free refill which sucks for $3.50. I'd go again. Wanna try shake and lamb burger some day. Price point is a bit high but occasionally I'd do it, its probably worth it.",

Although the place is WAY trendy and VERY \"hip,\" it's still filled with friendly, helpful staff, delicious food, a full bar, and fantastic soda bar (no Coke or Pepsi, here; this is Maine Root Fair Trade certified, organically sweetened soda).  I got a bison burger, the Buffalo Bill: I was almost expecting it would be too hot, as many of the \"Buffalo\"-inspired burgers are, but it was nicely tangy with THICK bacon and a very savory blue/jack cheese mix. The egg buns are nice and sturdy, able to hold all the weight of the burger and toppings but not overpowering the flavor. I ordered the regular Kennebec fries, which was enough to share, and tried one of the sodas (\"Doppleganger,\" which appears to be their version of Dr Pepper -- as good as Dublin cane-sweetened). Tried the chipotle ketchup, which went really well with the fries!   My wife got the tuna burger, sushi-rare, and said the honey wasabi opens the sinuses, but wow, was tasty!  While not as terrific as Delux (also not as expensive), still, this will definitely become a repeat location for us. It's close, it's delicious, and I really liked the staff and the ambiance. Definitely worth five stars!",

    "text": "Drove in to AZ yesterday and stopped here on a whim, the fact that they are a dog friendly patio was a plus for us. Good selection of craft beer and the burgers we had were also good. We had the Diablo and buffalo burger as well as some truffle fries which were awesome. We ended with a Nutella and salted pretzel shake, also super tasty. But the one thing that stood out to us the most was the great customer service. Geo who wasn't even our server came out made some recommendations and told us about the place. Our server nathaniel took great care of us and we had everything we needed without asking. Also the girl at the door was super sweet as well as the other girl who dropped out food off. Great job guys we will be back when were in Phoenix. I highly recommend this place.",

We sat down and had a great waiter. He was super jealous and did a great job. We all lived out food and I LOVED the Kale salad with chicken patty. Excellent. So for us it was a great value and we will be making this a regular spot.",

All of the young women working were so friendly and helpful-from the woman who took our order, the food runner and server. Hopefully their boss reads this and does something nice for them. This location has been so much better in my experience than the one in Scottsdale. The good is really good. Tonight I had the diablo burger. It is spicy but good. The server suggested sassy sauce. It was great. We had truffle fries as well. This is a great place for quick but excellent service that also has great food and cocktails/beer.",

    "text": "I definitely felt the vibe of the place. We were welcomed immediately and given a review of how the place runs. A very solid first impression. Unfortunately orders are taken when you walk in at the register. I would have liked a moment to look over the menu at a table as I felt almost rushed. However, the food was delivered promptly and was fantastic. I had the special (we came on a Saturday) and my friend the shroom burger. As it is marketed as a full bar, drink menus at the table would have been ideal. Also, as first timers, the host followed up with us to check how we were doing which was refreshing. Overall a great experience and will absolutely be coming back again.",

They do none of that. They only bring out food & condiments, don't even refill your fountain drinks. How much do you tip for such an incomplete service? Food was good but nothing special.  We probably won't be back, there are better options in the area.",

    "text": "The food here is delicious. I have been twice and both times my burger was really good. I also love the fries either with the green chili cheese or the chili con carne...both are awesome.   The first time I went with girlfriends and we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive, although the person who closed our tabs at the end messed up and overcharged me...like by a lot. She reversed it but it took several days for things to correct themselves in my bank account. The second time my sister and I went and ordered at the counter. We stood in line about 10 minutes and we finally got to the front woman behind the counter said they were on a table hold. Since they assign you a table and all the tables were full you basically just had to stand there and wait for something to open up. Luckily something did and we were seated and eating in a short amount of time.   My issues with the concept are:   1. Why am I waiting in line to order and not paying? There were tons of servers who could have just waited on you in a normal fashion. That way you also know the wait to get a table before standing in a really long line only to be told that you have to wait even longer.   2. Why do the servers ask you if you need anything? What can they bring you? You've ordered your food at the counter and you've filled your own drink...maybe drinks from the bar? I don't get it.   Despite these issues I will go back for the burgers and fries...I just wish they'd rethink the wacky concept.",
