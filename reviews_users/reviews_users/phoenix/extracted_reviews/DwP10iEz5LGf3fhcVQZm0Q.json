The first time I decided to check this place out, I called in and talked to a woman named Julianna. She was so sweet and very inviting, offering to give me directions to the spot. When I came in, she greeted me and remembered me from our conversation on the phone. She also gave me DELICIOUS recommendations from the menu such as the rib-eye wrapped asparagus. I had a lot of questions about the menu and she had an answer for every one of them which impressed me. Julianna alone made my visit so great that I decided to keep coming back. She's my go-to gal at Sushi Roku and has even helped me coordinate a dinner for my friends and family. I love Sushi Roku!",

We decided to get entrees rather than sushi for our meals, so I can't say anything really for the sushi despite it being part of the restaurant's name.  The entrees had a very generous amount of food on them, and were pretty tasty.    Part of the price tag on your menu is reflected in the atmosphere, and while the meal I had was good, I probably could get something with similar quality for cheaper at a different Japanese fusion type restaurant.",

The staff are pretty friendly, although the one staff member I dealt with didn't know a lot about the wines on the menu so that was a little frustrating.

The server never came back and out drinks were not refilled.  Part of our order was finally delivered but our appetizer was not to be seen.  We were finally told that there was a problem in the kitchen and a few minutes later the appetizer and second roll arrived. You would think. Being the only table in the restaurant, everything would be perfect.  Not the case.  Maybe that is why they are so super slow for lunch?  We'll go back to RA next time. :(",

I made reservations through their website for 9pm on a Saturday night \"girls night out!\" It was VERY busy so I was glad I had made reservations. We were able to get seated on time, however we waited a while to get our food. There was only one person at the table who ordered Sushi so it is not fair for me to rate the Sushi even though she said it was good. The rest of the table ordered drinks and main entrees. I am not a big meat person more of a veggie lover, though I spilt a  Teriyaki Steak which included Mash Potatoes, Rice and Sauteed Veggies. Along with Tempura Vegetables. Everything was great! The quality and quantity was reasonable for an upbeat Scottsdale restaurant. Our waiter was energetic which made it more fun.   Overall the restaurant was very clean. The staff was well groomed. The scene was hip, young and vibrant.  The bar is small but very packed. Great variety of food selections for those with different food preferences and large selection of beverages. The restaurant is attached to the W hotel so you can mix and mingle in the lounge or upstairs in the patio bar.",

First off, Stephen Dean coordinated a party of 14 for my daughters prom. He was professional, super accommodating and very nice. His turn around time for responding to emails was extremely prompt.  He created a perfect menu that all the kids would like. And made sure everyone had plenty to eat. Lastly, the service was impeccable and funny. As parents, we all know kids eating at restaurants don't usually get great service unless their parents are at the table. My daughter (who frequently dines out) said it was the best service her and her friends have ever had. The service was quick and they were well attended to. Not to mention the food was excellent. A big thank you goes out to everyone involved in making my daughters prom memorable!",

The specialty drinks were good as well. We were here for a friends bday and this is when it went downhill. It took 15 minutes to receive our drinks, it took so long we would order our second round before even finishing our first. Our server rarely came around and was not very educated. Sadly I am giving them two stars not for the food but for the service we received. With paying that much for a meal/drinks I expect much more then what sushi roku provided.

The chicken fried rice tasted like refrigerator and didn't have an Asian flavor due to the bland flavor and lack of seasoning. The sauteed brussel sprouts were really over cooked and very dry. This might have been the intent but they should go more for the soy sauce and vinegarette flavor.  We could only stomach one bite of the tempura sushi that again had no flavor and required us to request what flavor did we order. Anytime you have have to verify your sushi type, is not good.",

Everything was going wonderful until a food runner was grabbing plates and spilled sauce all over my hair. I made it very clear that he spilled sauce on my hair, chest and shoulder he apologized and tried to wipe me down with what smelt like a dirty napkin. I told him it was okay and that I was going to the restroom, he then told me he would bring me a wet rag. In the restroom my attempt to rid my hair of the soy sauce was a complete failure. I returned to the table expecting a wet napkin of some sort that may work better than the wet paper towels but the gentleman was no where to be found, and never returned to check on me. I normally would of gone home showered and shrugged it off, but it was my sister birthday and I had to troop along the entire night (4 hours) in misery, smelling like thick, goopy, sticky, soy sauce.  Thank you so much for a wonderful experience at Sushi Roku  (oh he also spilled sauce on my friends hair so not only did he spill sauce on my hair and I made it known he continued to not be careful and spill more on my friend!!!)",

The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and put up with our sake bomb messes all night.   Food was well presented and tasty. Ordered seaweed and cucumber salads which were not the expected traditional versions but still good. Excellent Yellow tail small dish followed by various rolls. It's a fun swanky place for date night. A bit pricy and non-traditional but that's what you'd expect for a W Hotel restaurant. Enjoy!",

I've spent my time working in the restaurant world and I try to be very easy/understanding because I know it can be stressful.   First experience a couple months ago was great, I'd give it 4 stars. Atmosphere is upbeat and fun, food is creative, it was good but high priced for what you get.  I went back because I had a good time, my second visit was terrible.  Our server Michelle was very rude (we're very easy/kind/not demanding), she snapped at us, messed up the order multiple times, and wouldn't even divide a check between two couples.  Every time we asked for something she'd snap right away \"NO\" and acted as if we were an inconvenience.  It was really disappointing because I brought friends and bragged about the place to come celebrate a special occasion, and it turned out terrible. I rarely leave a poor review but my overall opinion is good is decent, little too high priced, but worst service I've had in the last 2 years .",

The main restaurant has nice ambiance but a very \"club\" feel with loud music so we asked to sit out on the patio where we could hear each other talk. Giovanni was our server and he quickly suggested that given some \"guidelines\" he'd be happy to select our dishes - a surprise for each dish, and pushing us out of our standard \"Philadelphia roll\" boredom. We said yes, and were then treated over the next three hours to a set of masterpieces from Brussel sprout flakes to fluke quat to oh toro to tuna tartar and more, finishing with a flourish of zen smores for desert. Each dish was presented by Giovanni with nuanced descriptions and clear love of Japanese food. The flavor of each dish built in the one before, was multi-layered and delicate- we were laughing with amazement at how many ways by the end we had eaten truffles, for example.  A masterful evening, and we plan to come again soon for sake tasting. Fantastic restaurant!",

We got water right away and our waiter was super nice. The only thing I liked about this visit was the waiter. He was helpful and friendly.  The water had a horrible aftertaste to it and the people that came in after us noticed it too. If there is a problem with the water, dont serve it. The food was just ok. The kicker is when we got our bill for $60! It was lunch! Highly overpriced for the product. Probably won't go back again, but hey, we tried it.  I also want to add I am a vegetarian and the only vegetarian item on the menu was vegetable tempura for $11. It was mostly broccoli which I don't like. I ate maybe 3 pieces. The bento boxes offered for lunch don't have anything that I could eat.",

The Korean bbq short ribs were so salty we couldn't eat it. They wouldn't split the bill so it made it a long difficult process for us to figure things out. The price is very expensive for service and quality. I get better service and sushi from hole in the walls. The only good thing we had was the oysters so that's why they get 1 star.",

The restaurant manager even came out to make sure that we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal. Really classy, Seriously, their sushi was some of the freshest I had ever had! We had an assortment of sashimi. The grilled salmon was my favorite. It came with mashed potatoes and hijiki seaweed.   The creme brulee was to die for! The perfectly torched sugar gave a nice sticky crunchy bite to the creamy filling which was adorned with mixed berries. It was a pack of sweetness and tartness. Truly, a wonderful way to finish off an incredible dinner.",

There wasn't an overwhelming amount of rice. And overall, they were good portion sizes.   What I did love was this crispy spicy shrimp that they offered. It was lightly friend shrimp so it didn't make you feel full and bloated with unnecessary carbs. And the shrimp were whole pieces instead of the cheap \"popcorn\" type. It was a good portion for sharing and we even placed another order because it was so good!  After that, we headed upstairs to their rooftop lounge. One thing I love about Scottsdale is the dry heat. Even though it was 80+ degrees out, it was so refreshing to be outside sipping on a cocktail.  The space is huge! It's great for a wedding/group outing of 50+ people. If I worked in the area, this would definitely be the spot I'd choose for happy hour :)",

Filet wrapped asparagus - some of the lowest quality filet meat (if it really was filet) I have ever had.  So chewy and fatty that I had to spit out several pieces.  Kind of awkward when the server picks up your cloth napkin and a bunch of chewed up meat balls come flying out of it onto the table.  2.  Albacore sushi - tasted very fishy.  That's all I have to say about that.  3.  Eel and avocado roll - eel was fishy and chewy (kind of a mix between and the filet and albacore)...the rice was hard.  4.  Chicken stuffed peppers - extremely salty and oily.  5.  Truffle oil edamame - excellent!  6.  Green tea - excellent!

They have tasty drinks for cheap, which are definitely a good deal. I had some drink that was fizzy and had fresh strawberries in it... very tasty indeed. My friend and I split two apps, the tostada sort of thing with raw sushi on it and the pork belly on top of the rice cake, on special for 6$ each. They both sounded good and were recommended by the bartender. The tuna tostada was ok, but overwhelmed by a huge amount of pureed avocado. The portions were a little on the small side. Neither of us would order that again. The pork belly thing, on the other hand, was crazy delicious... I would definitely get it again, but the portion was small... like two bites.

Granted I was eating sushi in landlocked Scottsdale, so perhaps the joke is on me. Alas I was tired from my travels and was in desperate need of food, so I can't say I thought about my dining decision before going in.   The interior is pretty sleek (as is the decor of the whole hotel) so I'd say it'd still be a fun spot for a date. Our server was pretty cool too.

The service was great - we didn't have to ask for someone at all (granted it wasn't a busy night).   Our favorite things were the blue fin sashimi and the knife jaw snapper sashimi. We also ordered another red snapper sashimi, yellowtail diced chilies, yellowtail roll, tako rolls, spicy octopus roll, Katana roll, and Makato roll.  We ordered the Passion fruit and spice and honeydew drink which were both refreshing. Overall a great experience, fresh fish and good service.",

The sushi is pretty good, but honestly nothing spectacular.  Pretty standard special rolls.  Definitely nothing wrong about it.  I have also had the chicken entree.  The eggplant appetizer might take the cake at this place.    The overall vibe reminds me of the W hotel.  It's trying a little too hard to be trendy.  Dim lights (like, too dim... I've bumped into a couple people here because I can't see two feet in front of me.   Can I get a little more than 2 watts up in here?), modern decor, etc. etc.  It's a good go-to for hotel guests, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to go.",

Although we cannot be positive our illnesses came from the restaurant we do know that we have not all shared a common meal at anywhere other than this restaurant. Will definitely not be returning.

    "text": "While staying at the Indigo on business, I was referred to this place by my hotel bartender after I asked for a simple sushi place close by.  Simple it surely was; there were only a few people at the sushi bar and maybe two or three couples at the tables. Actually it was a bit boring, but then again, a quiet, no-frills experience was what I had asked for. Perhaps Wednesday is a slow night.  What I gleaned from my experience was:  1. High sushi quality, on par with what I have found elsewhere in Scottsdale.  2. Good service; I was asked very frequently how things tasted or if I wanted anything further. You might say this was due to the slow night, but I have certainly experienced poor service at restaurants under the same conditions.  3. Low prices, certainly relative to what you get in this neighborhood. I believe that for six nigiri pieces, a roll, and a small sake; the total including tax was $27. Not too shabby.  The high quality I had expected out of a Scottsdale joint; the high value I did not. The only reason this place did not receive 5 stars was that it had a bit of a strong smell. Not fishy, more reminiscent of fried food. Perhaps a tempura order went out of control; things happen. It was not unbearable... yet I could smell it on my clothes later that evening. Then again, I am sometimes overly sensitized to smells. Rest assured, will still go back to Sushi Roku next time.",

This place needs to close . It is ripe for the movie restaurant gone wrong. We were seated at 7:30 for reservations at 7:15 table not clean ok not the end of the world. It took 30 minutes to get menus and acknowledged we were there then another 45 minutes to get drinks. We left at 9:45 waiting for our rolls we ordered around 8:25 PM. The W Hotel should be embarrassed to have them as a tenant. The manager assured me this is not the norm and gave me the employee discount. I am ashamed that I subjected my wife and daughter to this place. Should be avoided at all cost until they revamp close and re-open.  Rick",

We love the Sunday and Monday offer of 1/2 off all sake bottles! Some of the finest selections can be found on their menu.  The manager sat with us and even provided tastings of some of his favorites all because I asked, \" what is the real difference between...\"  in turn, I received a full lesson and explanation of the polished rice process. LOVED that!  A 5 star \" as good as it gets sake bar\" experience for Sushi Roku",

The atmosphere is very romantic. The lights are dimmed yet there is enough light fixtures to set the mood. It's a sophisticated environment. This is the effect place for a romantic date night, a first date or a night out with the girlfriends.   I will have to say that as far as the food it's not that great compared to sushi places in Washington DC or New York. However, considering this area (phoenix or for that matter Arizona) it's good sushi. It's very westernized and not truly a Japanese style sushi restaurant. So don't expect too much. A lot of people thinking they are eating authentic style sushi in the restaurant... (that's a different rant for a different time and place...)   They offer a great listing for cocktails! My favorite was their lychee drink. Their sake is on point too. With that being said, on the weekends, this place is packed with people drinking. There are a lot of drunk people eating dinner. It gets pretty loud and hectic...",

The chef's choice nigiri sampler is as fresh as what you would find on a coastal city, and the garnishes on the nigiri are distinctive, innovative, and absolutely delicious. I also loved the Chilean Seabass and Roasted Cauliflower- two dishes I try at most restaurants I visit- and I was definitely impressed. These are classic dishes done extremely well, and while the bits at the bottom were soaked in sauce and overly salty, they were still happily devoured. Restaurant vibes were great as well-clean, modern, and a great spot for dates/business dinners/when you feel like getting fancy.",

Happy hour (bar seating only) seems like a good deal here, but otherwise the extensive sake list is not that accessible unless you're willing to spend a lot more than what it's worth. I don't think I'd be back (unless with a group for work on company dime).

She has always delivered excellent service & is great at recommending items to fit our taste buds. Whether it be a glass of Kistler Chardonnay...or our newfound favorite Yuzu Salmon Roll. She even spoke to the chefs to have them add jalapenos to our roll when we wanted a little \"kick.\" Overall, Sushi Roku has great food, ambiance, & excellent service due to employees like Bianca.",

It was the perfect place for a special night out, and my maid of honor who planned the dinner said the manager was easy to work with. He arranged a pre-fixe menu and every single dish was exquisite! Great value for what we paid. We were seated later than our dinner reservation and the managers brought out a round of drinks on the house, which went a long way in making up for the delay. Dan, the manager who took care of us, is really professional and friendly, and made sure that our group was well taken care of.   Delicious food and drinks + great service + beautiful ambience = perfect night out with my friends. Thanks for everything!",

The cocktails were fantastic, freshly made and presented great. I've been here several times and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. This time we ordered the bento box with sashimi and shishito peppers. The sashimi was very fresh and we received 2 pieces of 3 different fish. The shishito peppers and a great sauce- they could have been a little more spicy. We also did the sushi lunch combination which offered a good variety of fish and the baked crab hand roll which came out nice and warm and melted in your mouth. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner",

My favorites are the chicken skewers, hanabi, and California hand rolls.   Overall, I highly recommend Sushi Roku if you're looking for good sushi in the Phoenix area.  I'm from Vancouver where sushi is king, and Sushi Roku is one of the few Phoenix restaurants that comes close in comparison.",

My parents were in town and I wanted to show them an amazing night and I can honestly say that they left blown away by our experience here. Neither of them are major sushi fans so to win them over is no easy task, they are already talking about making it a tradition to eat here.  From the minute we walked in the door we were treated as royalty, being greeted by the manager (Mike Kirsch) from the get go is a refreshing change of pace, he assured us that if we needed anything we would be taken care of. Mike checked in multiple times throughout the night to make sure everything we needed was being addressed and of course, it was!   From the second I exited my uber to the minute I walked out the door we felt special, which is not typically a feeling I have when exiting a restaurant but this place is truly amazing.  I'll be back soon! Mike Kirsch and our server were off the charts, I need to get that mans work schedule because anytime he's there you are sure to have a world class experience.  Thanks to everyone at Sushi Roku in Scottsdale for an incredible night!",

The sushi quality is like nothing you will find in the valley.  I forgot to get our servers name but she was a lovely young lady!

Water had no ice and was not chilled if there wasn't a need for ice. 6$ water. The waitress made us feel like we were too poor after I asked for tap water and was not friendly.

Each time we ordered a new glass of wine, it took at least 20 min to come out, one of our appetizers was the very last item to come out (about 2 and a half hours after we ordered), and the wrong order was brought to our table at least 6 times. We had to wave down multiple bussers just to get any type of service, and although the manager comped a round of drinks, both the server and managers seemed to want us to just get frustrated enough to leave.   And the cherry on top is that we refused the dessert that we had originally requested since it was a birthday celebration, so instead they brought us a round of shots. We didn't ask for these, nor did we want them as all we wanted to do was get out of there and end our terrible experience. The entire tray of shots was spilled on one of the girls at our table, and to our party it was hysterical after the horrendous dining experience we endured, however, the person who spilled them should not have been laughing like he was.   Our entire bill should have been comped and I probably wouldn't be writing this. I reached out to the GM, and gave him a chance to rectify this situation but apparently he could care less about his customers experiences just as his employees. It's no wonder where they get it.   All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant, or go back. If you want mediocre sushi and terrible service then you'll probably be fine, but I expected much more from a restaurant associated with the W hotel.",

I had the pleasure of staying at The W for a training seminar I was attending and my coworker and I were addicted to Sushi Roku as soon as we got there.  We ate at this restaurant on 3 different occasions and were never bored with their food or atmosphere.    We tried a few appetizers; spicy edamame and a shrimp dumpling soup which was to die for!  So flavorful, I could have eaten just that...but ofcourse it didn't stop there.  We also had a few of their speciality rolls *don't remember which ones...sorry, as well as some sashimi and the Miso glazed Sea Bass with mash potatoes...yummy!  All were very good and I would have again, but I have to compliment the waitstaff, bartenders and manager who made a lasting impression.  We dined at the bar our last night and everyone was SUPER friendly and made us feel like apart of their 'Sushi Roku Family'....you guys rock!  Till next time...Irrishai-mase!!",

    "text": "Sushi Roku stakes claim to an amazing ambiance. The modern vibe and styling of the W Hotel that Roku is located in, carried over and translated very well into the restaurant. I loved the upscale and hip vibe! My party and I decided to each order a roll... We're from California and are spoiled with our fresh seafood. There was a question mark on how the sushi in Scottsdale would compare to that of the bay area. Everyone was VERY pleased with both the portion sizes and the quality. The lobster roll was a table favorite. For dessert, we ordered the dessert spring rolls. They were amazing!!!!!!! Um... think spring roll filled with berries. banana, and paired with vanilla ice cream. Now, imagine what heaven would taste like, and there was our rolls!  Next time I find myself in Scottsdale, I would absolutely return!",

Our waiter Tim was fantastic helping us choose several kinds of rolls and sashimi, Tim even brought the food out over the course of 30 minutes allowing us  to savor the different flavors and have them smoothly blend through out the meal. Aftwards we were treated to a lovely frozen lemon tart and finished with a warm hand towel.",

    "text": "Well, after being in AZ for the week and being pleasantly surprised at the low price of our restaurant/bar bills, we finally ate/drank a $200 meal. Hubby insisted on trying a sushi place in Scottsdale because of the sheer number and high rankings. I dubiously complied. While you won't find anything exotic or too creative, you will find a solid selection and freshness as long as you remember there's no ocean front property in AZ. The sushi chef was a young man from Japan and the waitress was super nice. The restaurant is located inside a W Hotel with a corresponding atmosphere. Here are the turn offs: 1. I caught something moving out of the corner of my eye on my chopstick. I chased the bug down under my plate and didn't know what to do but smash it with my napkin. I did not want to look too close, flagged the waitress down and she took care of it wiping down and replacing my dinnerware. 2. Shishito peppers are drowning in a sauce that is overwhelmingly sweet and even more overwhelmingly salty. The menu does not indicate they are in a \"sauce\" and I expected them sprinkled with sea salt as I've usually had in other places. 3. I had the great misfortune of being seated where I had a bird's eye view of someone who was obviously a regular and her dinner companions shoving their tongues down each other's throat. Sigh, judgmental yes, but just not what I want to see while eating dinner and nothing the restaurant can do about that. Keeping in mind the context, if we are ever in the mood for sushi in Scottsdale again, we would return.",

I think the hamachi was some of the freshest tasting fish I've ever had - I could have eaten it until I exploded!  And not going to lie...was not so sure about ordering sushi in the desert :)   Their bottles of bubbly were decently priced and they had a good selection. I LOVE the sushi and champagne combo :)   The waiter was very attentive without being bothersome, even after it started getting more and more crowded. It did get pretty loud toward the end of our meal but it's in the W so not surprising.   I would definitely return.",

He also disappeared for long periods, yet other tables had attentive staff waiting on them. Once he found out we weren't ordering cocktails he stopped trying altogether. The food itself was nothing in particular either. Same as Roka Akor sushi wise. The food wasn't as good as Sumo maya though. Overall massively disappointed in the whole evening (especially considering a vey basic roll was $18.50, we had two appetizers and two rolls coming to $80) and won't be going back.",

I love how friendly the staff is but most importantly LOVE Dan the GM, congrats on the promotion Dan you more then deserve it! Today I visited Sushi Roku Scottsdale looking forward to the food, friendly staff and of course seeing my favorite person Dan who sadly wasn't there at the time but still myself and company enjoyed ourselves. The food was amazing as always and Sarah our server was phenomenal, she is so genuine just all around an asset to the company, I also had the pleasure of meeting the manager on duty Steve he was also great and very sweet! Steve had heard about my horrendous Experience at the Sushi Roku in LA ( Santa Monica) as that is where I reside and took care of our dessert as he felt horrible knowing what my experience was like at the Santa Monica Location. I was thrilled to know there was one in my area, I talked so highly of Sushi Roku Scottsdale to friends of mine and told them there was one in Santa Monica and decided to show them what all the hype was about, only to walk out embarrassed as the Santa Monica location was just terrible the service was awful and the food was less then mediocre the menu also wasn't completely the same, they didn't have the miso glaze popcorn shrimp tempura ( which Dan got me hooked on it's seriously amazing) and they didn't have creme brulee. So all in all I have come to the conclusion that if i want Sushi Roku with high end level of service, amazing food and phenomenal staff I guess I have to drive 4 hours to get it! Sorry I missed you Dan but your staff most definitely kept it consistent even with you not there major kudos! Until next time! -Ashley",

We are both servers so we can be picky about the service we receive but she was spot on & gave great recommendations. We started with the roasted cauliflower, & shared 2 rolls: the katana & the gensai (which Kris recommended). Both were amazing! the fish was fresh & the gensai roll was perfectly spicy & so refreshing. She also recommended the Yuzu cocktail which was excellent and so different ive never seen anything like it anywhere else. At the end of the night, even though we decided against dessert, Kris brought us the chocolate lava cake since it was my birthday. We had an amazing experience thank you so much for making my birthday so special!!",

    "text": "3 girlfriends and I had dinner here Saturday night, no occasion, just celebrating a girls weekend. We had a cute booth with a good view of the whole place, right in the middle of the fun. We ordered a carafe of sake and Sapporo. Really tasty and fairly priced. The food was amazing! We ordered edamame, Brussels sprout chips are amazing and buttery and crispy- loved everything about it, a few different sushi rolls and potstickers. The potstickers weren't my fav., but everything else was delicious!!   Toward the end of the meal the waitress brought out a few yummy shots, on the house, as well as a yummy dessert! The hospitality was unexpected and a nice treat! It's a great ambiance/environment for a girls night out, birthday or just a date night. Staff was friendly and food. Mae out relatively quickly.  My only minus star is for the bathroom :/ it is so confusing to find the men and the women. They share and entrance and then split off, but there is no sign to which side is which. So i definitely walked in on a man peeing. There is also a shared sink/wash up area, which I'm not a fan of. Privacy and separation is nice.  Otherwise, great place!",

I regularly eat at higher end restaurants so I expected it would be somewhat expensive since its in the W hotel.  To start I must say, the food was all delicious although the portions seemed smaller than typical for sushi restaurants.  We were suggested by our waitress that\" usually\" she picks the menu based on a few questions she had for us. Of course you know in that situation it's going to be more expensive.  We ate had sake and beer and it was great, until we all said we were done. Our waitress dropped off another dish and said she had already put the order in before we told her we were full.  Of course we said it was fine.  Then 10 minutes later another dish shows up.  At that point we objected sending it back. I think we were all surprised when our bill was just under $800 for the 5 of us. Maybe I'm just out of touch with high priced places but that's just too much for what we had.  Of course we paid and took care of our waitress but I don't see a return trip anytime soon.  I think I'll just go to the French Laundry in Yountville, CA next time.",

Several friends highly recommended this restaurant not only for great food, but for its outstanding customer service as well. Although the bar was set high from the outset, both my wife and I could not have had a better experience.  We were not that familiar with Sushi, or many other items on the menu. Fortunately, our server Nicole, did an unbelievable job in clearly explaining everything to us and even made perfect recommendations that made our dining experience top notch. It was almost like she knew exactly what our taste buds would prefer.   No more long delays in taking my wife for a romantic night out.    Sushi Roku is now a scheduled weekly destination.  I'll be sure to ask for Nicole as our server.  So nice when your server is as helpful and pleasant as her.   I'd recommend Sushi Roku in a heart beat!",

Wasn't very spicy.  All in all average sushi.  This was a birthday party for 3 people I will add and by the time they brought out the birthday cake over half the party had left as we had finished our meal about an hour prior and there was only a handful of people left.  At the end of the night the wait staff tried to charge us all for items we didn't order which included $65 dollars in bottled water.  After we disagreed we asked to speak to a manager who shrugged the whole thing off and walked off during our conversation (possibly to admire his over priced suit in the mirror) leaving us wondering what the outcome was.  About 20 minutes later we decided to finally leave.  Not paying for overpriced bottled water.  This place is probably perfect for you if you want to get drunk and go upstairs and listen to horrible dance music after a average to below average meal",

However the hostess was able to find us a table outside. The servers and server assistants were all very helpful. We ordered drinks as well as the sushi for two people platter. Three people asked to take our drink order and three people asked if we received our order. The sushi came out first which raised a flag to ask where were the drinks we ordered.  When we finally got the drinks everything else went smoothly and the sushi was very good. The server also took it upon herself to surprise us a molten chocolate cake dessert for our wait on the drinks. Very kind and generous and I appreciate the empowerment.

It goes without saying that the food is exquisite from the menu staple items, to the daily specials, and the sake selection! All of the employees are knowledgeable and friendly as they guide you through the menu to ensure a perfect meal. The team is lead by a great manager, Mike Kirsch. I booked a New Years Eve dinner at Roku for my girlfriend and I. Needless to say, it was extremely busy. Mike took the time to swing by my table several times to check on us and step in with refills and food drop offs when the wait staff was tied up. He helped make New Years a perfect evening! I've been back several times since, and have had the pleasure to meet the other manager Dan who hosted a business meal for me. Dan held the same high standards as Mike and guided us through a fantastic evening. This is by far my favorite sushi spot in town for any occasion. Don't miss out!",

My recent lunch there surpassed all of these and any expectations from my first visit in 2010.    Here's what I ate, all prepared by a young sushi chef named Moon, who is in my book a rising sushi star:  Uni sushi - this was two pieces of uni of the highest quality, sweet and unctuous, simply perfect  Spicy scallop hand roll - sweet and fresh scallops, so fresh they were almost a bit crunchy when bitten into, and the sauce was subtly spicy, but not overly hot.  The nori they use here is of the best quality - it crackles when you bite into it, but does not shatter.  Eel and avocado hand roll - Uber-rich, sweet and addictive.  The avocado was at its peak of ripeness, the eel sweet and almost melting, and the sauce, which Moon told me was cooked down from sea eel, lent a sweet and an umami flavor to this wonderful roll.  Baked crab hand roll - My favorite dish of the day.  Beautiful crab (it tasted like Alaskan king, but not sure), baked with garlic butter and wrapped in soy paper.  If you love crab, you MUST order this.  I need to have it again.  So good.  Service was great, I  enjoyed speaking with Moon about all kinds of food topics, and the sushi bar is a pleasant place to while away a midday hour.  I went on a slow Sunday afternoon and am so glad that I did.  It can be quite a scene on weekend evenings (lots of pretty blonde women in tiny black dresses), but come for the food, too!  Highly recommended.",

All the staff was fast and efficient, being able to clear plates as soon as they were empty. Refills were promptly taken care of too.  Food we had: - 16 piece sashimi of various fish, some were first time tries for me! - Brussel sprouts. They were super savory with bacon pieces, yum! - shishito peppers, delicious with a little kick at the end - tuna carpaccio was flavorful - yellow tail sashimi with diced chilled, super tasty with the sauces! Reminded me of carpaccio  - king crab handrolls were exceptionally good. I loved the butter dipping sauce on it. They bring out kind of last to coat your palate better.  - beef wrapped asparagus was really good with the teriyaki sauce and cool hot stone on the bottom - we had the flute sashimi special that came over ice. The dipping sauce had a little bit of a kick but it went really well with the cold fish. It was hard to take off of the lead though :(  Dessert: - we got the platter to share that came with the lava cake, creme brulee and a banana egg roll. The creme brulee was really tasty and not too sweet. The others were okay. I wish the lava cake cake with ice cream though to balance the chocolate in the middle. - we also got mochi. You pick 3 flavors and the ones we got were red bean, green tea and passion fruit. These were tasty but melt really fast! They cut each one in half too so it's easy to share.  Wine on Sunday as well as sake were all half off if under $130 so we got red wine and tried a sparkling sake called Pouchi Pouchi. It's a bit dryer with a hint of sweetness.   Bathroom - my coworkers told me the men's restroom has a picture of a lady looking at your package in there.. Seems interesting! :)",

Well here we go, We made a reservation for 2 for New Year's Eve some time ago and we were seated literally right at the entrance door at a high top table. Ok so still not a 2 star problem right, yeah it keeps going folks...we are down to 4 stars now.   So second the food was good, not what I expected from a restaurant at a location as this. When it couldn't fit on the table, the waiting staff didn't make much effort to make room but rather just left plates angled on top of each other. I like to give solution and not just complain, so what I would do is maybe give a little more time between serving dishes or make efforts to make room for it so things aren't spilling. Ok so we are down to 3 stars.  Now here's the kicker...the drink order we put in as the first thing...never came...she didn't even come check on us once the entire time. On any day but especially nye, not acceptable.  So there you have it, 2 stars. Pick a better place or come here for the hustle and bustle and no cares about service.",

Some items were pretty good, like the sea bass and the spicy edamame. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. It was pretty good; I would just warn any serious foodies that they may be a little disappointed.",

My girlfriend had the white lotus roll and it had a really weird smoky flavor. The waiter forgot to put my Hamachi order in so that took forever. It was good but the sashimi was paper thin so again not worth it. Not worth the money. IF I ever were to come back, I would just try sashimi and nigiri.",

We started to order 2 drinks at a time when we go now.  To be paying $800 and more every time we come to get sushi service should be amazing.  This has been going on for years here.

Then, we had 2 rolls, which were unnecessarily jazzed up with extra sauces/oils and the flavor was fair at best. We also had the ribeye, which actually was quite tough and fatty and pretty low quality considering the steep price.  All in all, this place is a nice destination if you are seeking atmosphere; however, if you are a foodie and are expecting a quality meal to match the steep price, you may be sorely disappointed.",

The sushi had a very fishy smell yet no real flavor, and the soup was lukewarm and also lacked flavor. Clearly not worth the surcharge let alone regular prices, but you live and you learn.

My server was pretty good. He was very attentive and nice. Even when I wanted to order something special that wasn't on the menu he went and found out what they could do (I wanted a crunch roll, which they didn't have the little, round, crunchy bread things).  The sushi was average. The water was... questionable. It tasted like dirty tap water (and I say this as someone who has never even asked for a lemon in their water and grew up drinking well water and untreated water all his life). The couple that walked in later after us also commented on the water being off. So if you plan on drinking water, plan on drinking bottled water.  The place is pretty cool. I could see this being a banging spot to bring that hot date you've been hankering to impress. It is like two rooms both with very large, nice-looking bars. Who knows, maybe it is even a club at night. I could see that - this is Scottsdale, after all. And part of The W, also.  Prices were pretty high (+50$ for two people, no drinks, 4 rolls).   And with that said, I feel like I'd rather come here and party than eat sushi. The hot GF agrees.",

And usually that precedent is set from the moment you walk up to the hostess stand. WHY is this an undervalued position at most restaurants? PLEASE, Sushi Roku, do not put someone at the front desk that cannot seat people properly. After two strolls through the dining room while walking back to tables that weren't open...not once, but twice... I finally asked to just stand where I was until they could find me a seat.   Maybe it was a bad night for them, who knows. But, if you read my reviews you'll see I'm an overly friendly yelper. The fact that I actually got irritated and let the hostess know I was frustrated speaks high volume.  Moving along, the food was great and the server was great. This wasn't my first time here. I've eaten here several times, including breakfast a few times. The  Dishes we had:  Organic Garden Salad - Delicious! Mixed Vegetable Tempura - Broccoli was the best American Kobe Potsticker \"Gyoza\" - Loved Baked Lobster Roll - MUST TRY! Salmon Sashimi - Maybe wasn't feeling the sushi, just OK  And if you like pear, don't skip the Pear Martini! Garnished with Parmesan Cheese! Amazing flavor and plus a little antipasti bonus.  I've yet to have a full experience at Sushi Roku, but that doesn't mean I'll stop going. It might be one of those ongoing hit and miss situations - I just keep hitting the miss. Looking forward to the hit!",

Their cocktails are yummy, I had a refreshing St. Germaine, as well as some miso soup and veggie tempura (not a fish person, ew).  Good place for girls night, or dates. If you're a resident of Scottsdale, they even feature a \"locals discount\" certain times during the summer.. Thumbs up to management!",

He knew the menu, was able to answer all questions regarding gluten free and vegan items, made great suggestions for the dietary restrictions and got everything right!  There were 13 of us yelling out food orders for rolls and appetizers and nothing was missed.  Our drinks were promptly refilled, table pre-bussed, set up nicely for dessert and everything was absolutely delicious!  Sushi Roku doesn't fall short in any regard...great ambiance, upbeat music, good energy, superior service and amazing food.    You can certainly tell that the management is exceptional!",

The head chef even payed a visit to our table asking if we enjoyed the food, and yes we did!! The restaurant is a winner for impressing your clients or casual night out with friends.

The fish was of high quality and everything was fresh! The atmosphere was very unique, loved it. We had the Toban Yaki which was very expensive but it was worth the money. The premium tofu is a must-have and the spicy tuna was great. We had Nicole as our server. Nicole was very knowledgeable and her personality was lovely. When we asked for suggestions she listened to what each one of liked and she went from there. Everything Nicole brought out to us left us with big grins. Very tasty! Great job Nicole, we will be asking for you and learn more about the menu.",

Their selection of sushi is good, but there are a few favs. they are missing.  *can't remember their actual names* Some of the dishes are fabulous like the beef wrapped asparagus but, their tofu sampler (cold) was not good nor flavorful.  When I come with my foodie friend we just tell the sushi chef to prepare some great sushi (omakase style), they make a specialty roll for me & we order our fav hot dishes with some nigori sake.  It is always great this way... however, I don't see the bill and probably wouldn't want to.",

Black Truffle Tempura Handroll  2. Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus 3.  The triple desert sampler (chocolate \"lava\" cake was awesome!\"  While it wasn't cheap -- it was well worth the cost.

    "text": "If I am in the Old Town area of Scottsdale mid-day, this is my go-to lunch spot. It's never loud at lunch and the atmosphere is totally different from a dinner service there, far more tranquil. It is a place I meet clients for lunch frequently because it is never louder than a dull roar.    For lunch, get one of their Custom Bento Boxes. In the bento box you get to pick two options I get mine with Chicken Kara-age (which I think tastes somewhat like KFC, minus their extra grease) and sashimi which is six pieces consisting of two of each of the following fish, yellowtail, salmon and tuna. One day they were out of regular tuna sashimi and they had to give me fatty tuna (Toro), what a fantastic mistake that was for me and my happy tummy.  I think I read someones review that called the place a \"hipster hangout\" I've never heard a more inaccurate statement made about this particular establishment. Hipsters like PBR and indie music, all they will get at Sushi Roku is a Sapporo and some fantastic yellowtail. I would call this place \"hip\" though, the decor is very intimate and interesting, especially at night and they do a very good job of being trendy which of course attracts the people that want to be \"seen\". What I mean is Hipster, no. Beautiful people and wanabees, yes. Having said that, I do not think there is a restaurant I have ever seen more actual celebrities at in Scottsdale than this one, recent spottings include Kristen Schaal and Rainn Wilson.    For dinner appetizers you can't go wrong with the yellowtail with diced chiles or the hanabi. For mains you can do the \"omakase\" at the sushi bar if you've got the deep pockets and adventurous appetite or just stick with the ribeye with Japonais sauce which is an umami overload!",

We were blown away by the ambience of the restaurant, it was modern, but had a timeless sense of class.  We stuck strictly to the happy hour menu, which features 30+ small bites and drink, including sushi rolls. We started with Edamame Hummus w/ Wonton Chips ($3). It was  justt the right consistency, and very refreshing. The edamame and wonton chips were a nice addition that gave this mediterranean dish a fresh asian twist. We also had the America Kobe Meatballs ($4). They were deep fried, but not greasy at all. The dipping sauce was also an excellent paring with the meatballs. Next up was the Hanabi for $5 (Spicy yellowtail on crispy rice). This was by far our favorite. The crunchiness meeting the soft texture of the sushi was out of this world. It was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had at a sushi bar. We also got A Spicy Yellowtail roll and an Albacore Salsa Roll ($3 each). Both were excellent, exactly what'd you'd expect from a cut roll. To top it all off we got the Bana Berry Spring Rolls ($3). The crunchy exterior meeting the sweet, soft center was excellent. The drizzled caramel on top made it only more perfect.   Overall we had a great experience with the food. We would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys asian cuisine. Also, if you love finding deals like we do, you should definitely check out the Whistl app on the App store. Free to download and no signup!  Enjoy Fellow Foodies!!",

Patrons ranged from a group of business associates to an 18th birthday party.    To partake in the specials, we sat in the bar area.  Our server was extremely pleasant and attentive throughout the evening.  We started with the Sushi Roku vodka drink special, a Kirin and a cold sake.  ($3 for sake and $4 for the vodka)  Sake was unfiltered and slightly sweet - we really enjoyed it.  Could have done without the vodka drink, which was way too sweet and seemed nearly non-alcoholic.  Moving onto the food... we ordered the miso eggplant, which for $3 was delicious and a steal.  Also tried the spicy yellowtail roll (average), tuna tartare (slightly below average - was practically minced and not well seasoned) and the Kobe meatballs (great).  Walked out with around a $40 tab and very pleased with the experience.  We'll definitely be back, as there were plenty of other specials on the menu which we didn't get to try.",

We loved it! The yellowtail sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious & all the specialty rolls we had were great too. And oh! Don't forget the toro tartare! Ermegawd, I was in heaven. The waiter we had was super nice, very attentive & even scored us a free dessert, as he overheard us mention our anniversary was coming up in the next month or so. Sunday nights are a great time to dine here, as all wine & sake by the bottle is 1/2 price! So we had some sweet M &C for a great price. In addition, on Sundays in their bar, they have an all-night Happy Hour stating at 4pm. The drinks were tasty, albeit kinda weak ( not a surprise) but the food was really good & generous portions for only $5 per plate. So we came here after a day of lounging at the pool..then went back to our room, napped, showered, came back for dinner 4-5 hours later. Good times. :)",

I don't go out that much, so when I do, I want it to be a relatively meaningful experience. The food is amazing -- MUST get the popcorn shrimp app which is the most elegant lightly fried shrimp I've ever had. The sushi rolls are great.

Miso soup = the same as everywhere else   The Katana roll = dude this thing is freaking amazing but for 16 bucks I dont know soo good though.   some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back   Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush   All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed   The waiter was soo weird and creepy. I was there with my gf and a friend and he asked my friend if she was having a rough night, WTF!!! Dont ask a girl if she was having a rough night. Might as well said you look like shit. So weird.

    "text": "This one is hard. The whole place is conflicted between excellence and douchetasticness.  THE GOOD (aka: the food) If you've been to another Roku, or even a Nobu, the menu will look familiar, as will the prices.  The sushi selection was pretty deep, with a good specials list, and lots of options. All the fish was very fresh, and as good as you can get in Phoenix, unless you're a regular somewhere else and get the special stuff. My benchmark for this is 'saba'. Usually, if you're not a regular somewhere, you get the dried out, pickled-herring tasting stuff. But Roku sent out the good stuff. Moist and delicious.  The sushi rice was excellent. Some of the portions were a bit awkward, with the rice ball minimized maybe to make the top portion seem larger...? But very good. I would sit at the bar next time.  The hot and cold plates were of the standard \"inventive new japanese\" type, but very well executed.  THE OKAY (aka: the bar) Decent selection of beers and sake. Some frou frou specialty cocktails. But if you can't make a Vodka Tonic, you're fired. That wasn't tonic. Sent it back, came back again. Not tonic. 1 of 3 things going on here:  1) waitress screwed up twice (doubtful, she seemed competent and sober) 2) bartender screwed up twice 3) tonic is on tap, and tap was screwed up and only delivering carbonation and no syrup. if so, the bartender isn't checking the taps - see #2 above.  I like a Vodka Soda too, so I let it slide and didn't send it back again.  THE UGLY (aka: the overal l experience) Normally, a W hotel is a chill spot in every city. You can count on upscale and relatively low key business/pleasure travelers, great service. Cool vibe. But I'm afraid this W will be plagued by the same velvet rope bullshit that haunted the James and Mondrian when they first opened.   We scurried through the lobby and were greeted by a nicely scripted hostess (who knew how to work the reservations system), and an Atlantic City magician in a Sushi Roku host's suit (who didn't know how to work the reservations system). Guido act in full effect. At least he didn't punch us in the face or anything. Probably not fair to judge him. I'm sorry. He's probably a nice guy, but the demeanor doesn't fit the place. I would be floored if he could point to Japan on a map. Or if he punched me in the face.  The decor is very upscale, modern and generally over-the-top, but well done.  Then as we get escorted in... Host bellows a Jersey Shore approximation of \"Irrasshai!\", to which all 3000 or so staff bellow back \"IRRASSHAI!!!\" This happens EVERY FUCKING TIME a new party is seated. The only thing louder was the table of seemingly underage rich kids getting hammered for someone's 19th birthday. \"We're bombin, dude!\" I think \"bombin\" means ruining both your sake and beer by mixing them in the same glass. The table was out of control and acted like they were at a Super Sweet 16, but were not approached by mgmt, as far as we could see.   Elsewhere, cougars on the prowl. Some horrified rich people. And some troubled foodies.  OVERALL The food was very good . The experience was pretty cheesy. Some of the staff must find it hard not to chuckle when they're trying to prepare and serve A+ dishes. They need to tone it down to keep a return business. The sake bomber crowd isn't gonna keep coming back at $100/head, and fine diners don't want their conversations (and even thoughts) drowned out by Vegas theatrics, unnecessary \"security\" and obnoxious guests. The servers are very young and inexperienced, and still in script mode. They need to be able to read when a table doesn't need to be taught about a menu. But I imagine the ones who make it will relax and hit a groove if management lets them.  We'll head back to the bar on a week night, as far away from the \"show\" as possible, and enjoy some sushi.",

The designers of this place had a clear vision of what they wanted in mind, and they executed it with complete, meticulous precision. You can dislike that vision if you want, because you hate Scottsdale's douchebaggery or whatever the case may be. But then, I would question why you'd bother to come here in the first place.   The environment was typical of W's I've seen around the country: upscale, chic, a bit clubby, all the things that attract male douches and female hotties. The service was professional and prompt. The sushi was the best I've ever had in the desert with the glaring exception of Yasu. The bill for four of us was well over 200 bucks before tip, but we left happy because we got what we paid for.",

I would compare it to Asia De Cuba (but better - not trying that hard) and decor blows ADC away!   Very hip and not too crowded (yet).  Hope it can keep a trendy feel (while still remaining sophisticated).  All sushi rolls were great and loved the Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus (very tiny, but tasty) Loved banana desert & signature cocktails.  The decor is amazing.  Upstairs bar with pool is pure eye candy.  Love the red shades.  A back drop for a great night out for sure.  Service was AMAZING.  Hostess was friendly and professional, GM came to our table - very cool and nice.  Waitress rocked - what more can I say?  LOVED IT!  Going back again tonight!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch today. Was a little disappointed in the service and food. The restaurant is connected to the W Hotel in Scottsdale, great location. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and modern. As for the service, the waitress took about 15 minutes to come by the table to get our drink order. Once she did, it took another 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. We then ordered the food. She brought out the first order of suchi and had forgotten to bring our edamame for our appetizer. We then asked her for it. Then she brought out another dish and forgot half of it. We then sat for another 15 minutes before any other food came out. I asked the waitress what was taking so long (since there was only 2 others tables in the entire restaurant), she said that everyone was ordering sushi and they were busy. That wasn't the brightest response because 1 we are at a sushi restaurant, so of course people will be ordering sushi, 2 she only had 3 tables to wait on. Once we did get our sushi, the rolls fell a apart. So it just seemed as though everything was just not up to par, especially for the amount of money you pay.   As for the food itself, we had the following:  Spicy Tuna hand roll Softshell Crab Roll Rock Shrimp Jalapeno Roll Cucumber Roll Kobe Skewer  The food itself wasn't bad, it was more of the experience that wasn't great.",

    "text": "My relationship with Sushi Roku is a love hate thing, from beginning to end. I went with a group of 7 friends on opening day and we were able to get a reservation simply based on our positions at various hotels around the valley, and saw a 30 minute wait after our 8:30PM reservation, which was ok seeing as they squoze us in. When I pulled up, I was amazed at all the vehicles in the valet lot, so I kept driving and parked around the corner. The place made me feel small from the beginning!  The entire space is beautiful and very well done. It's hip, yet upscale, and a very fun atmosphere. The servers are very friendly even though some of them are not fully trained in the restaurant. The food I had was delicous. Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious, as was the salmon and toro sushi. The yakatori sticks were very bland and almost seemed as though they were done with a greek seasoning, rather than a sweet Japanese. The food did come out quickly, even on a day when the place was packed way over capacity. Drinks, however, were not so quick. I had 2 greyhounds @ 14 each and I swear neither of them had any alcohol in them and have heard similar grumblings from others as well. I have to assume their bartenders have previous experience from other places, but it didn't seem as such. I heard a LOT of smashed glasses as well. The whole night seemed like a mess for them.  The restrooms were very cool, if not a bit confusing. They told me to go in through the door to the restrooms and I saw a lot of women standing around and figured I was headed for the womens room. But infact the men and women share the communal sinks and waiting areas, but have their own bathroom area, which was different. I feel the atmosphere was definitely typical Scottsdale but a little different in some areas where it was obvoius they put some neat touches in it.   I had one major gripe with the place, a little out of the restaurants control, was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department. These guys thought they were professional bouncers at Las Vegas night clubs.  We had been going back and forth between the restaurant and the lobby all night with no problems. At one point a big black guy said I cant come in, and this was after my whole party just went in front of me. I said \"look count chocula, I've been in here all night, and all of my friends just walked by you. Don't stand there and tell me your hands are tied or you are over capicaty or something like that, because I know it is bs. I'm going past you.\" His co-worker came over and told him to let me in. The guy would have beat  me into the ground if he had wanted to but it worked out.   They need to get their security department going in a proper fashion, and work on the bar quite a bit, and the place will be a real winner. I'm sure that it will come with time, so I'm giving it 4 stars under the assumption that it is going to improve in time.",

YELP would have saved me   I should have known better .... when you're waiting for a table and you see a sea full of empty tables that the restaurant could care less if you are waiting or not ..... god YELP me   I should have known better when the restaurant never seats you at a table, keeps making up excuses as to why you can't sit down, you find a bug in your drink and they only comp you for part of your bill .... its time to give that place a big YELPIN review  Ok so bottom line ...  Sushi Roku is a trendy place in Scottsdale, its kind of hip.. but again you're in Scottsdale   I should have known better and left restaurant after being told it would take 30 minutes to get a table.  But instead I decided to take my chances and that was my bad.   The saving graces of the night was my dinner party, and the very helpful and wonderful waiter STAN.  Stan allowed me to give Roku an extra star.    Sum it up: Roku ain't worth it... move on",

The irony is I happened to eat sushi earlier today at a different restaurant, and Sushi Roku's same dish, just blew the other place's right out of the water!  OMG!    Add excellent food (the prices were definitely a bit higher than other sushi places- but still the flavor and quality were tangible things you can actually TASTE), excellent service (Angela was a complete doll!- and the GM Seth rocks!), and fresh and fab decor, and you have a winner!  Mark my words, this will be THE place to be seen for quite some time to come.    On a side note, I also liked the trendy-ness (and yet very approachable and friendly nature) of the hotel in general.  Everyone was super cool and welcoming to my friend and I.....although it doesn't hurt that she is smokin' hot and we are both super friendly and nice!  But it did appear that EVERYONE was greeted and served graciously.  The fillet appetizer (wrapped around asparagus) was divine!  The spicy tuna rolls literally melt in your mouth, and the soft crab rolls are a little slice of heaven.    Be sure to look your best and have fun people watching while enjoying a great meal!  (But save up, 'cause it ain't cheep!)  BTW, we went on a Thurs, and it was pretty packed.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!!  Warmest wishes,  Kirin :)",

Don't get me wrong, I love a good rainbow roll but sashimi is the main event.  I had the chef's sashimi sampler and I have never had fresher fish in Phoenix. The blue fin had a perfectly delicate flavor while melting in my mouth. I'm usually not a huge fan of uni, but it was so fresh, I had to finish every last bite. The blue fin special with truffles (definitely not to be confused with a blue light special, mostly because of the truffles) was the perfect starter.  I was planning on going for a drink and a couple of small appetizers and ended up eating a full meal (I am powerless against the rainbow roll, especially after a few drinks of saki).  The place looks great. It is clean and well designed. The staff was also excellent with just the right amount of attention without being bothersome.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.",

I ordered a pear martini which took forever to get and it's even worst when you are trying to get the attention of someone to order a beverage or food. They were busy watching the football game, And avoiding the table. But the pear martini was delicious. The albacore salsa roll was very flavorful! We also ordered a few spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. The Kobe slider with bacon jam was sooo good! Didn't expect that. Most defiantly recommend that on the happy our menu along with the albacore salsa roll. The tempera asparagus with aioli sauce was also not so good. Too thick and crunchy tempera almonds a more simple asparagus would have been better with the sauce. Overall I enjoyed the night but probably would only go back to try the main menu on a different day then Sunday, unless I'm up for happy hour and a pear martini.",

Both have always been willing to go above and beyond to ensure we always have a great dining experience. The managers are always present walking around and make it a point to stop by to welcome us everytine we are there as well as the rest of the staff.

    "text": "Short Review:  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE 5 STAR RESTAURANT!!  Long Review:  Nestled within Scottsdale W, a 5 STAR RESORT, is Scottsdale's SUSHI ROKU, a 5 STAR RESTAURANT.  ABOUT SUSHI ROKU  Sushi Roku is part of IDG, Innovative Dinning Group. IDG owns and operates, SUSHI ROKU, ROKU, BOA STEAKHOUSE, KATANA, and ROBATA BAR.  Sushi Roku combines the finest, freshest fish from pristine waters around the globe with the kind of artistry that can only be provided by a mature sushi chef ensuring traditional sushi, together with a splash of contemporary California innovation.  Sushi Roku has locations in Santa Monica, Pasadena, Newport Beach, Las Vegas, and Scottsdale.  THE STORY  I've had the pleasure of eating at Sushi Roku a couple of times, and it never disappoints. The last visit was OUTSTANDING!  We started with one of their sake flights (see pic). Their sake flights are innovative and bold, and included some Arizona sakes. We had a couple appetizers, including the A-5 Japanese Wagyu Ishi-Yaki, which is grilled over a bincho charcoal, was the best meat that has ever been in my mouth. Sushi Roku's Wagyu appetizer alone is worth the visit. Everything was unique and fresh, and had DELICIOUS BOLD FLAVORS. We ended with desert, the lemon souffle, which was not only the perfect finale to the meal, but my photo was featured in their instagram! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fsushirokuaz&s=74b938e66b32bf53250bab584fc16d8517f62cc82360a2d77568abd51a88c7df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/sushirokuaz</a> (see pic)  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  The service was EXCEPTIONAL! We were treated like royalty and our main server was so fun and enjoyable, we kept mentioning that he should have his own show. It was the type of interaction that added to the meal, and was non obtrusive, which I always appreciate.  CONCLUSION  This restaurant is a gem! This is truly one of the best dining experiences I've had lately. As long as nothing changes, I would happily eat here again and again! I hope I get a chance to experience Sushi Roku's other locations too!  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *Valet Parking Available.  *Other Locations: Santa Monica, Pasadena, Newport Beach, Las Vegas, and Scottsdale  *Their Social Media is TOP NOTCH  *For More Information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsushiroku.com&s=aa2a472fcdb16e0f419962ce051b9bd91b72f1516ee3810cb21be0f40ada72ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sushiroku.com</a>",

We had a prime table for Scottsdale people watching - from couples to bachelor/bachelorette parties we saw it all here.   We had the bake crab hand roll, asparagus wrapped in beef, and sashimi sampler. Everything was fresh and tasty, but I certainly wish that they had gluten free soy sauce. I would assumed a restaurant this expensive and in a hotel would accommodate gluten free people.   Due to no soy sauce for me, I wouldn't come back for sushi but maybe I'd try something else. Service was fine for a busy Saturday night, but nothing spectacular to share.",

We can look past the noise, the yelling, the loud music...all of that is fine if the service and food are dynamite. Well, they weren't....with the exception of Kyle the manager who was fantastic.  Our server couldn't have cared less about our non-trendy family: our water glasses stayed empty, there was no \"how is everything?\" or \"can I get you anything?\"   My steak was so unbelievably salty I sent it back half eaten and she kept it on the bill.  At 7:30 on a Saturday they ran out of salmon and cod. The birthday boy had to order chicken, which was mediocre at best.  The runners had their thumbs in the food when they put the plates down on the table.  A salad was brought over that we didn't order and the runner's response was \"the server told me to just leave it here.\"  They cut a large birthday cake into 5 pieces and served it, I've never seen an individual piece of cake so big in my life.  Kyle stepped in and took excellent care of us which is why I'm adding the extra star, otherwise this was most certainly a one-star dinner.",

We placed our order before 12.45 and 35mns later the tartare and sushi arrive. 5mns later I am presented with a dish of asparagus and long stem broccoli. Nicely cooked except some pieces were hot and others cold! I was asked whether I'd like a fork with my vegetables. I replied I'd rather have my fish! I called the manager over who told me my cod  dish took longer to prepare. It arrived at 1.30pm.  Nicely cooked but not worth the wait. Because I had enquired about the whereabouts of our food 30mms into the wait and then twice after, the manager arrived with my fish and told me my meal was complementary. We had to ask 2 different servers for extra sauce. I enquired to 3 different servers about my cod dish. Each time I was assured it was on its way. The food being bought out separately is irritating.  Comping a dish is too easy a cop out for restaurants. I dont go out wanting a free meal but a decent one with good service. I will not be returning.",

We had so many things on the menu I'm not going to list them all, but the rolls were scrumptious, the asperagus wrapped steak was so delish, and my family had the spare ribs (unfortunately I couldn't try them) which they just drooled over! Also, to mention, I am gluten intollerant and the waiter was very knowledged on what I could and could not have. I was able to eat almost everything we ordered, so it made my experience even that much better! We had a great time and will definitely be back... Even with the cops showing up to arrest the half naked guy walking through the restaurant! Haha fun times!",

I simply wanted sushi so I searched for sushi restaurants near our hotel and decided to check out this place cause the star rating wasn't bad and reviews were decent compared to other sushi places.  This place is fancyyy. It's connected to the W hotel and has a lounge as well. We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 mins or so for an actual table. We went for the bar.  The staff at the bar were very helpful and knew they were behind due to the amount of customers, but were trying their best to get all the orders out as fast as possible. Their edamame had salt sprinked on it; I didn't mind cause it was something new. I tried some rolls here and they were good. Nothing exceptional.  I did try some fresh sushi for the first time (I usually just get rolls) and those were exceptional. My first time trying Toro and it was a great experience. It was so fresh and soft. Yellowtail was good as well. The Popcorn Shrimp Tempura was delicious. Warm, flavorful, and the gaze on it was just right.  Those who had a birthday received a special treat. There's a SURPRISE on that dessert! :)",

We had:   The Yellowtail with diced chilis in ponzu was ordered right away, that stuff is melt in your mouth flavor.  Popcorn Shrimp: Awesome!  Filet mignonette wrapped asparagus is super fun dish that comes out on a hot rock!  Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, Eel and Sea Urchin Sushi. Quality fish. Don't like sea urchin anywhere else.  The star was Toro sashimi / Caviar on top. Really decadent.  Katana and Mokoto Rolls   Baked Crab Hand Rolls! Always need these!  They have a good wine and sake menu, and one of the girls got a cold nigori, which is a milky sweet sake. The rest of us had some same bombs!   The best part is I was afraid to go because it was a double date and my co workers date is allergic to all types of stuff, including nuts and shellfish, but I assured him the steak was good, which I get sometimes. He ordered the Ribeye Japonais and loved it! It comes with potatoes and green beans and has this buttery garlic sauce that is so good.  Our server Jennah killed it as usual. I always ask for her, she really knows how to take care of guests. Waters never empty, no mistakes, very professional.  The employees in general are really trained well to keep the table clean, since so many small plates are coming and going.  This double date was important to me to have a bonding experience with someone from work! Thanks Sushi Roku!",

Located inside of the W Hotel, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful with an expansive circular Sushi Bar at the far end of the restaurant.  The service by both our waiter and the gentleman behind the sushi bar was excellent. They were very helpful with navigating the menu and making suggestions.   For dinner we had a few cut and hand rolls of differing varieties. The sushi was fresh and delicious. Benefit of ordering from the sushi bar is that you are able to customize and even ask for certain things off the menu.  The price does slightly leave a little more to be desired as this place truly is in the $$$ category which is why we can only give it a 4 star review. Overall it was a great meal and we plan on going back soon.",

    "text": "Sushi Roku used to be our favorite sushi restaurant in the area. We've been here to celebrate an anniversary, a birthday, and fun date nights whenever we got the craving for sushi. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have declined in the past year. Our most recent experience left a bad taste in our mouth and I don't think we'll be returning any time soon.  We came here on a Friday night before the Christmas holiday and were surprised the restaurant was playing such loud club music. We joked that we felt we were eating on the dance floor. The ambiance just wasn't as inviting or classy as it was previously. Things went downhill from here..   The Katana Roll was not as flavorful as it has been in the past and the presentation was different. For a $17 \"specialty sushi roll\" we were expecting something special and were left quite disappointed.  The Caterpillar Roll was also not as good as it has been in the past. I could've sworn that this inside out roll used to include crab meat inside, but our server said that I must be thinking of their Dragon Roll. I highly doubt it because the Dragon Roll isn't even on the menu. In any case, this roll was also quite disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty $16 price. The roll had a tiny piece of unagi inside, which was cold rather than hot and freshly cooked.   All in all, quite disappointing and sad that the quality of this once 5 star place has declined to the point that I can't rate it higher than 3 stars.",

You can move next door to the Living Room Lounge area which has a fireplace and nice lobby bar at the W, or go to the rooftop bar later for a club atmosphere. The Kobe sliders have changed from two smaller ones to a single big one, but remains very tasty. The Tuna Tartare was just okay. The Albacore Sashimi was decent. The Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos were good, but of course, fried. The top pick probably is still the Kobe slider and the Mini Chocolate Volcano. See photos.",

Came to try this place with 2 of my other friends and my fiance for happy hour. Called ahead to see if they were slammed or not..person who answered the phone said no we have 3 tables open to sit 4 in the bar area for happy hour. I said may you please hold it we will be there in 15 min..he stated no we're not that busy.  We got there and stated we have a party of 4 for your happy hour.  He states we don't have anything available right now but we can sit you in the sushi bar area if you would like..(He heard us say we r here for happy hour) so he takes us there sits us down. A few moments later our server comes and we ask for the happy hr menu..she states..\"that's at the bar area\" i said yes the gentleman brought us to sit here at this sushi bar since no tables were available at the other bar area.  She went and asked the manager to see if we can get happy hr prices ...he states no. I talk to him...his name is Mike who was very rude ...racist  ..and condescending.  I told him why would he not honor the price of happy hr since we told his employee from the beginning and he was the one who sat us here.  He told me that he will have his employees back..and sorry for the misunderstanding and that we can leave if we don't like the regular prices!  (Mike who's the manager there)....just bc we did not dress like we did not make enough money to eat at your restaurant (you treated us like dirt) we would never treated you like that if we provided healthcare and the tables were turned here...it was a matter of principle. Both my friend and I have doctorate degrees.  So please don't judge people based on what clothes or skin color they have.  Your doctor one day might be Indian...or Jewish so please stop the racism at your restaurant.",

It's a great place for a date. We like to walk through the W Hotel entrance to enjoy the lounge scene. Another plus is going to the W pool deck to hang out and schmooze post sake The food was expensive and good. To drop a couple of big bills and not be wowed is criminal. We had some winner dishes and the only real loser was some kind of steak skewer.  Our server kept pointing us to the specials. We like to sit at the bar and watch the artistry of the food being prepared. We tried a number of times to encourage the chef to be creative with a particular item ie, sea eel to no avail. It was right off the \"special\" menu and very tasty but not an eye roller. Guess these specials are tried and True throughout the entire chain of sushi restaurants this group owns. Perhaps therein lies the problem, the CHAIN effect... cookie cutter sushi; good and satisfying, but not memorable.",

He went through basically the entire menu with us after we said we hadn't been there before, giving suggestions and letting us know what was his favorite. Started with shishito peppers (ok, would have been better without the sauce) and green beans (sister enjoyed, I was meh, just didn't care the sauce). We went with the chefs special which included 12 pieces of his choice, a California roll, and a spicy tuna roll. I think it was about $40? Not awful and the pieces were tasty. The best of the meal for me was the sake sampler. 3 almost-double shots of different sakes for $12. YUM.",

My business partner and I were warmly greeted and chose to nestle in to a corner spot at the sushi bar.  We ended up in front of the Sous Chef Tony.  He recommended doing \"omakase\" and basically started flooding our plates with beautiful pieces of elegantly dressed fish from all over the world like golden eye snapper, live octopus and wagyu beef.  Our server Jonathan was attentive and recommended an awesome bottle of sake; the Gensai.  Even the manager, Dan stopped by to check on us and explain how sake was brewed and the grading processes.  We not only learned a ton but we enjoyed the experience as a whole from service to food to drink and even the ambiance.  Highly recommended and I hope to be in Scottsdale for business again soon simply for this establishment!!!",

While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?! I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of \"The Ugly Truth\" or \"When Harry Met Sally,\" take your pick. If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I wish I could say something. Anything. But, all I got is nothing, because that's what I got before I left the most craptastic table known to mankind.  I never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.  I got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.  They had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move.\" My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone.   The chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area.   That was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.  We left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces.   Basically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos. Not even a freaking glass of water.",

    "text": "Wildly popular Sushi Roku is now in Scottsdale at the W Hotel.  It's atmosphere is ornate and blends organic textures setting the stage for  freshly-prepared sushi and sashimi fare.   The food goes beyond the expected and blends ingredients such as jalapeno peppers into more traditional Asian fare giving a unique touch to every dish. The bar serves up some wild concoctions that will surely cure what ails you, and there's a good selection of sakes and a creative wine list.   Since I went to Sushi Roku last night without a reservation, my friend and I ponied up to the bar. We were greeted by a team of very knowledgeable and service oriented bartenders. Dylon offered some fantastic food recommendations. Oh, and ladies...he's total eye candy! He was very attentive and took care of us even as the bar got busier.   Stephani cured my ailments with one of the most unique and delish martini's I've had in a long time! It was the Passion & Spice martini. It's made w/ Skyy Passion vodka, muddled jalapeno, orange juice and some other secret \"sauces\"!  Its sweet (but not overly sweet) w/ a slightly spicy finish. If I had a tail it would be wagging over this drink!  My friend had the Strawberry Fizz martini created with muddled fresh strawberries. Very summertime!! Caution: these drinks go down easy!    The edamame hummus appetizer is refreshingly unique. It's made with black edamame and the beans are only vaguely darker, yet sweeter than the familiar green.  Their creamy, buttery texture easily adopts the flavor and spices of traditional chickpea hummus. It's served with 3 dipping chip varieties: fried won ton, lotus and sweet potato. Yum-O!   I also indulged in the Filet Mignon wrapped jumbo asparagus w/ Soy Mirin Sauce (served tapas style) and the mixed veggie tempura.  The flavors were perfect and the drinks compliment these creative dishes.   With it's critically acclaimed Modern Japanese fare and Zen-like atmosphere, Sushi Roku will be a favorite among both locals and visitors.",

If your boyfriend take you there and enjoy upscale/romantic atmosphere, it's a right place.  Service was good and their restroom is very unique. When I walked into the restroom, I thought I was drunk after a glass of sake. But the washing hands sinks are located between men/women's restroom.  A very kind gentleman indicated to me the women's restroom. Thanks to him.",

We were a little early so we sat in the bar with Regis who was super cool and outgoing. We had a couple of mojitos that were too sweet for us but still pretty good. We ate the spicy yellowtail, kobe potstickers and tempura shrimp. The yellowtail was amazing! We then got seated by a nice hostess (tall blond) and were put in Justins station. Needless to say, he was awesome! The happy hour on sundays is phenomenal. Half priced bottles of wine. So, we imbibed. My friend asked Justin a ton of questions and was borderline annoying but Justin kept his cool and treated us well. The manager, Stephen came by and was also very professional and courteous. We had the filet wrapped asparagus and the short ribs  were delicious. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would definitely return.",

    "text": "I went to Sushi Roku for lunch one day in LA and wasn't a big fan.  Since they opened in Scottsdale though and I love sushi, I thought I would give it another try.  It was only the second weekend they have been open so considering we had to wait an hour for our reservation wasn't so bad because the whole world seemed to be there so talking to everyone made the time pass quickly.  I didn't even think I was in Scottsdale.  Just watching the crowded scene at Sushi Roku and the W Hotel was enough to keep anyone occupied.  They offered us the sushi bar at one point but we opted to wait for a table since it was more of where the action seemed to be.  We got our table and instantly started eating because 1. The table sitting next to us starting sharing their sweet potato chips with us and 2. They brought us edamame without us even ordering it (that scores huge with me)!  At this point since we had waited for a while we weren't starving so we ordered the baked lobster roll and the yellowtail sashimi with diced chilies.  I was hesitant about ordering the lobster roll because I thought it would be heavy and it was actually the opposite - very light.  The yellowtail was so unbelievable I could eat it everyday, all day.  Now the table on the other side of us starting sharing their filet mignon wrapped in asparagus which was very tasty.  They also started pouring us their sake as well which was great!  The ahi tuna carpaccio arrived compliments of the owner as well as a dessert.  All of the desserts sounded so good we told our waitress to surprise us.  She brought some type of egg rolls with ice cream but we were too full to eat them so we reciprocated and gave them to the table next to us.  Our waitress for a new restaurant was perfect.  She was nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  The owner came to sit with us as we were finishing up and was asking ideas of where to possibly open a Boa Steakhouse (also one of LA's amazing restaurants that Innovative Dining Group owns).  I was so excited and told him that Scottsdale Quarter would be the perfect place for Boa.  Now we started our venture to the W Hotel Pool Bar.  To be able to describe all of this would definitely need its own review.  It was a little chaotic at first (with the line, etc - but we ended up only having to wait five minutes), but it turned out to be such a fun night.  I can't wait to go back and hope it stays this way for a while (not because it just opened).   It was fun running into so many people there as well all in a new atmosphere which was very cool.  I loved the pool!  I'll leave it at that and let Gabi write more on this since I wrote about Sushi Roku :)",

They are trying to be the Nobu of Scottsdale and it comes off as a sushi version of Mortons. No the atmosphere is not sexy; the W hotel is sexy, Sushi Roku is not! The service is definitely rushed and I certainly enjoyed my time more at Stingray than Sushi Roku. I like the variety of the menu but the execution is amateur. The food is good but incredibly overpiced. I certainly have no problem paying 200-300 for a meal but it better be good and honestly the sushi at Stingray, Ra and Kyoto is better than this place. The only nice thing about this restaurant is that it is located in the W. However, don't expect to receive any perks at the W for dining here. It may be connected to it but it doesn't get you upstairs or past the W hotel bouncers in the lounge adjacent to the restaurant.",

My \"date\" and I stroll in Monday evening and because it had just opened 3 days earlier I was expecting it to be much more crowded then it was. But that was OK.  The whole atmosphere of the restaurant was perfect; dark and sexy until they sat us next to the sushi bar where some type of refrigeration unit was running. I could barely even hear the waitress when she came to our table. She did happily seat us at a table further away from what ever that thing was.  They had a great cocktail list. I had a drink called the fusion which was the perfect blend of berries, watermelon and vodka. It was not overly sweet. They can make a mean dirty Grey goose vodka as well.  The tofu appetizer was to die for, for those that are tofu fanatics. They make their own tofu in house and serve it with truffles, caviar and green onion. Heavenly! The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town.  Now for the Sashimi. Their pieces we cut quite a bit larger than most sushi places but also not cut through all the way so you end up with a huge hunk of fish. We did mention it to the waitress. We also thought the sashimi was not the freshest around. We felt like splashing some water on it to bring it to life! Same goes with the ginger, it appeared freeze dried!  The roll I ordered was one of the best I've had though. It was called something like the Samir. Avocado and spicy tuna rolled in shrimp with rice paper, cilantro and some \"hot sauce\". Yum-E. It melted in my mouth and did not fall apart between my chop sticks! Impressive!  So overall, I will definitely be visiting this place again. Maybe not for the sashimi but everything else was top par!!",

We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.  Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.  In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu.   We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.  (The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)",

The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options. I'm not usually a big fan of yellowtail but a friend insisted I try their yellowtail sashimi appetizer. The fiand was so fresh and delicate and the ponzu sauce was so fantastic that I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I tried big eye tuna sashimi for the first time here and was blown away. I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku. We had some standard rolls which were also great but my absolute favorite thing I had was the lobster Roll with soy paper and a misoyaki butter sauce. It was so unbelievably delicious! I've been back several times for that roll alone. The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner.",

So I thought I would check it out myself. What I didn't know until I got there was they have a few different menus. We ended up sitting in the Lounge and everything on the menu was $5. We had the popcorn shrimp tempura, edamame hummus (it was incredible), tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, and several drinks. It was totally affordable!  They also told us about this Stimulus Menu. It's like $30 a person and you get your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. Which I think is a great deal. You would spend wayyyy more than that on a regular dinner. So next time we go I'm trying that for sure!",

My favorites: - Yellowtail Sashami with Chilis - light and so good. - Organic Garden Salad - almost too pretty to eat with all the vegetable curls, but of course I did and it was delicious. - Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus - SO YUMMY!!! Had a delicious glaze/sauce to go with it. - Hanabi Spicy Tuna on Rice Cakes - MY FAVORITE!!! Recommended by our server and I was hesitant but the spicy tuna and the crispy rice cake go so perfect together. - Chilean Sea Bass - YUM!!! I had gotten this to-go a few times after seeing it featured in Phoenix magazine, but was even better straight from the kitchen.  I also had some sort of specialty margarita that was so good and went perfectly with the food. Our server was AWESOME and the decor was beautiful (we sat in a booth near the sushi bar). Prices were in line with what we spent at Geisha House, which I thought was quite reasonable for a high-end sushi restaurant. Definitely the night out we were hoping for and we will be back.",

So we stopped in Phoenix for the evening and this spot came with highest recommendations. Panko encrusted salmon for him and veggie rolls for me. I barely saw the plate set down before the salmon was devoured. The veggie roll however...man, did they put some spin on a pretty basic dish. I'm never wowed by sushi restaurants simply because I never order anything wow-able. They sure proved me wrong. Totally filling, deliciously flavorful and made exactly to my particular orders (not too big, rice paper, no seaweed, etc. etc.). We had the pesto tomato mozzarella salad and chicken satay (both specials) as well and while they were devoured pretty quickly they just don't stick out in my mind like those veggie rolls. A pretty innocuous dish that most would likely never seek out but if you have a finicky friend on the fence about joining you for a night at Sushi Roku, they cannot go wrong with this order.",

The tasting menu was a GREAT opportunity to sample their sushi offerings as well as some of their other entrees.  I'm still a bit of a sushi virgin and while I thoroughly enjoyed everything, my more seasoned sushi-eaters said that they had had better. They offered a braised pork belly that was fantastic and as one who does not like miso soup AT ALL, I LOVED the miso that was served at Sushi Roku.  We were puzzled that the sake we ordered was served cold as we're used to warm sake, Our server, who was awesome (and a ginger I might add) explained that warming of sake is usually done to make the lower quality sakes more flavorful.....not too sure about that. So all in all the sake was not the best we'd had but we made the most of it.  The atmosphere is cool and the service is great. I would recommend it to anyone and there are some great dishes for any sushi-haters to enjoy.",

The food really was delicious.  My wife had a plate of grilled vegetables that were excellent and my steak could not have been better.  Our daughters had noodles and sushi and, again, delicious.  Okay for you Japanese purists out there.  We sat next to a group of 4 Japanese adults who didn't have enough English to get through Run Jane Run.

He loves sushi and we pretty much only eat California rolls but we are adventurous!  We decided on Sushi Roku.  At first, it was a bit intimidating for my family as we had not idea where to even start on the menu.  My kids are adventurous but if they didn't like sushi, we really didn't have too many other menu items to fall back on.  From the moment we stepped in and until we left, I was impressed.  The restaurant was beautiful and I loved that you can see the sushi chefs creating the dishes so close to our table.  We left the ordering to my brother as we had no idea (I actually thought the \"caterpillar roll\" on the menu was made with caterpillars).  Dumb, I know.  The food was exceptional!  We ordered:  Edamame Hummus w/Chips Yellowtail Sashimi (it was so good we ordered 2 plates) Baked Crab Handroll  California (of course) Popcorn Shrimp Tempura w/Jalapeno (excellent - not what I was expecting for a tempura dish) Spicy Tuna Mackerel Sushi Salmon Sushi Yellowtail Sushi Stir Fry Chicken Rice And 2 other rolls that I can't remember  I am happy to say that the food was very good.  My boys tried everything and loved it.   My brother (who eats sushi a lot) said that it was very good.  Our server Max was very attentive and allowed us to put the pace on the meal.  It was a very pleasant evening and now we are wanting to check out a good sushi place when we get back home!  FYI...unless your kids are adventurous eaters and well behaved, this is not the restaurant for kids.  At first we got a lot of strange looks (and some worried) when we walked in with twin 7 year olds.  It is a more upscale adult atmosphere.   But the pace of the dinner and spreading out the dishes kept things interesting for the boys so they were never bored.",

The sushi case was filled most variety of fish that I've seen since my days living in S. Cali.  Since dinner happens to land during their summer happy hour (wow...it's cheap) we did a mix between the 2 menus.    Oysters 3 ways - all I remember is the one with hami, hami oyster with uni & caviar (5*) ...OMG, I will be dreaming about this dish for a very long time. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=n3aVAzN_-SyGAdkuLyb4Ew\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP1...</a>  Halibut Special (5*) - thinly slice halibut on ice (tender, slightly chewy, with a light flavor) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=Fb5juM08pTBbFGH1WKtD8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP1...</a>  Seared Blue Fin Tuna with white truffle oil, micro arugula & parmesan cheese (5*) - the Spanish blue fin just melted in my mouth..yum!  Zuke Hawaiian big eye tuna (5*) - the marinated tuna has the perfect balance of ginger, tamari & maui onion  From the HH menu -  - Bacardi Moitos (5*) & Skyy Voka Fusion (5*) -Spicy yellowtail  roll (4*)  -California rolls (5*) - where else can you score real crab meat Calirolls for $3.50!?!??! -Asian BBQ Short Ribs (2*) - way too salty & tasted like liver - Calamari with ponzu (2*) - kinda of under cooked...not crispy at all  The service was awesome and ambiance was perfect (guess it's more causal during HH).  Yes, the raw stuff was kinda of pricey but worth every penny.  I hope I won't have to wait too long for another date night ....*sigh*",

Every one involved incredibly fresh fish with thoughtful use of ingredients with a beautiful presentation.  Each bite delivered often subtle but intricate play of flavors and textures.  The selection of fish was much broader than the usual good sushi restaurant.   All of the wait staff and sushi chefs I encountered were attentive and knowledgable.  And no one made me feel self-conscious that I had arrived in my jeans and walking shoes.

    "text": "If you are looking for a taste of the rich life without actually being rich, then consider hitting Sushi Roku at The W hotel between 5pm and 6:30pm Monday through Saturday.  This place is great for a date or a place to kick it with friends. You are at The W, so you have the upscale feeling of being posh, and because the prices are so good during happy hour, you can actually have the satisfaction of saying \"I'll have one of everything on the menu\" which is exactly what I did!  Atmosphere: Sushi Roku is a quintessential modern Asian establishment. While it is chic, it is oddly authentically Asian. It feels open yet intimate at the same time.  My favorites from the menu:  Sushi Roku Fusion ($4 a glass, $18 a pitcher). As you walk past the bar you will notice a gigantic glass jug filled with fruit and vodka. This is the Fusion, and it is deliciously addicting, yet sneakily strong.  My favorite sake, nigori sake (cold, unfiltered sake which in in my opinion has a lot more flavor and is smoother) and also hot sake for just $4.  Miso Eggplant ($5). I have never EVER desired eggplant or ordered it at a restaurant, but after trying this dish, at least once a week I find myself salivating over the thought of the Miso Eggplant. This appetizer is a big reason I keep coming back.  Sauteed Chinese Green Beans ($3). Crunchy and flavorful, these beans are the beans knees! I don't fancy myself a vegetarian, but I have never been so delighted eating a plate of straight veggies.  Tuna Tartar ($6). If you like raw tuna and avocado, this dish will melt your taste buds. Don't let the ugly name fool you. This is a beautiful dish with a beautiful taste.  Oysters ($2.5 each). These oysters have more flavor that most any other oyster I've swallowed. They have a garnish of Asian citrus flavors which subtly mask the True oceanic taste of the oyster, so if you are looking for the traditional unadulterated oysters, these may not be the ones for you.  On a side note, kudos to the staff. The servers, bartenders, and managers, are extremely accommodating, helpful, and very friendly. They all genuinely wanted us to have a great experience, which we did.  After your meal, take the time to meander upstairs and see the outside dining area which edges the famous W pool, the social epicenter of the who's who's and hooha's of Scottsdale.",

However, the service was extremely slow even though the restaurant was not crowded; instead, the waiters were busy flirting with the girls at the hostess stand. I was going to order more food, but got put off at having to wait over 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention.  This place is also extremely over priced. The fish inside the rolls were mushy - this just means that they take the leftover fish cuttings from the sashimi and mash it up to fill the rolls (you can see it in many of the pictures other reviewers have posted). At ~$10 a roll, I would expect much more. The Brussels sprout chips were very tasty and flavorful with the truffle oil addition, however they are deep fried and DRENCHED in oil (not truffle oil). The chef ought to let the oil drain off before serving as the sprouts were sitting in a pool of oil.",

    "text": "If you are looking between here and Roka Akor, as there are many similarities on the surface, I STRONGLY suggest you choose Sushi Roku.  We visited Roka Akor last weekend, had a nigiri and drinks course, left and went to Sushi Roku, and were so glad we did!  (Research!)  Sushi Roku had a great atmosphere, once you got in.  Parking is a bit tricky as the W valet was overwhelmed, but once we were settled into the cozy, elegant booth things were 100%.  Great service, delicious pieces of tuna (best bluefin!), salmon (including a fatty king!), albacore (not seared like Roka Akor!), chutoro and otoro.  Prices were a skosh high but we all understand Phoenix is not on the ocean.  Between us we also tried two cocktails and a joyous sake flight that was presented with a complete non-condescending explanation.  Large group of happy-looking women flanked the dining area along the banquette and couples and groups alike held down the booths in the middle.  We felt like we were somewhere :-) but somewhere that invites all.  Roka Akor, parking was a breeze and the hostess was a darling but everything else was supersnob, especially the sushi chef who wouldn't serve us our food (even though we were seated at the sushi bar in front of him) but preferred to yell to a server to come bring it to us.  The restaurant was also pretty empty.  Food was meh at best.",

Definitely ask to be seated in his area and you will sincerely enjoy your meal. The food was scrumptious and the preparations were different than what we have had at other sushi spots across the globe.   What we ate: - Eggplant miso: the miso sauce is amazing and the eggplant was so fresh.  -Albacore sashimi with fried onions: the fried onions add a nice crunch -Tuna tartare with truffle: literally the best tartare I've ever had, melted in your mouth- and the truffle was very present  -Beef ribeye wrapped over asparagus- the sweet sauce was finger licking good.  - Creamy miso popcorn shrimp (replaced with seabass instead of shrimp): thankful that the kitchen was ready to accommodate, also the best creamy Miso sauce. A must order!!  -Spicy tuna crispy rice (aka hanabi): a generous serving of the spicy tuna on top, and it was served immediately so you had a good mix of the hot rice cake with the colder tuna. -Tuna Jalapeno roll- super fresh, served with fried onion, and so much tuna!  Finished off with two of their classic melon mix shooters.   Overall an extremely delicious, and memorable meal. We would definitely recommend coming here and if we return to Scottsdale we would reserve here for sure.",

The tuna was a little small, the salmon was perfectly sized and absolutely delicious. I also had a custom-made role since none of their specialty rolls included tuna. I think there were probably 10 pieces so a good size. All in all excellent but I walked out with a $70 bill eating by myself. Not complaining. Just sayin.",

    "text": "Without question the single worst dining experience in memory. I kept glancing around for a candid camera or something. We left in a stupor of disbelief, disgust and regret.   Four of us show up around 10pm on a Friday night. The place is still fairly busy but not packed by any means. We were seated almost immediately next to the image I would expect to accompany the definition of Scottsdale d-bag couple in the dictionary. Over tanned, tatted up, huge biceps and pudgy middle, fake lips, boobs, everything, tons of makeup, absurd amount of jewelry. Cross between circus clowns and the cast of Jersey Shore. That was as good as it was going to get.   We sat there for at least 15 minutes before a single person stopped by our table. When our late 20something male server showed up he wasn't apologetic. He immediately tried to bond with us like we were long lost bros finally reunited. It was obnoxious, contrived and poorly received considering he was off to a miserable start. We order drinks, which ends up being very confusing for him. How many large bottles of beer? What brand? Five minutes later he stops back to \"double check\" our drink order. YES, that's the order. Now put it in already. We've been here 20+ minutes and you haven't served us a drink!?   He comes back again to take our food order. In his defense (he really doesn't deserve any), two of us are native Seattleites and consider ourselves sushi connoisseurs (not in a pretentious way - we just have a deep appreciation for and eat it frequently). We ask about the size of the sashimi and nigiri orders and he launches into a long description of the difference between the two. Yes, we know. We order an assortment of nigiri and a roll to start, which is our standard approach to ordering at a place new to us. Sample a bit and assess the quality. After more hemming an hawing, he finally takes our order and leaves. Five minutes later he comes back AGAIN to double check our order. \"Now that was all nigiri, right? The sushi with rice underneath?\" He says he's going to do us a solid and redeem himself by sending out a free warm crab roll. Ohh, yay! At this point we think this must be a prank. Is this guy high? Inept? Both? What is going on? We confirm, again. He leaves.   Then he FINALLY shows up with our drinks and he's got the beer wrong. At this point he launches into a sob story explanation about how he was called in outside his regular shift, only had 3 hours of sleep, blah, blah. He's now playing the sympathy card. I was getting nauseous. Please just bring the food and leave us alone. The last thing we want to hear about it your problems during our dinner.   At least 20 minutes go by while we enjoy some time without our server making us cringe and the food finally arrives. The portions are small to tiny. The quality is okay at best. I've had better at a conveyor belt place back home. The server comes back and says something like \"Isn't that the most amazing roll you've ever had?\" Dear God. No, actually, it's not. Please leave.   We foolishly decide to order a couple more items (we were still hungry) and our server tells us the rather expensive snapper on the fresh list is incredible. In the five years he's worked there they've never had it and it's the best fish he's ever had. That should have been our clue not to order it. We did anyway. It comes out and it's seared skin on. It was, again, just okay and certainly not worth the price. Here comes server guy telling us how amazing it was again. Please, please, please just bring the check.   He shows up with the check and, this will shock you, it's wrong. He's charged us for the roll he sent out to redeem himself. We point it out and request it be removed and he's stunned. No waaay. I'm so sorry I'll take that off right away. He shows up five minutes later to \"double check\" that we wanted the free roll he sent out removed from the bill. I almost fell out of my chair. Then he has the audacity to deliver the final, corrected check and tell us when we come in next time, to request him and he'll give us some free rolls to redeem himself. You have got to be joking? The kicker is the price of such a horrific experience. We were so ready to get the hell out of there we just paid and split. If it had been earlier in the evening I would have spoken to the manager and made sure I wasn't ripped off.   Quick summary - this place is in the W and it's targeted at what I can only assume is their typical demographic. They substantially over charge for mediocre sushi because they can and, based on other reviews, practice suspect billing (like trying to charge us for the comp'd roll). I will never, ever return and hope some day my friends and I can laugh about how we were literally robbed of a couple quality hours together while we endured this debacle of a dining experience.",

I went last night for a friends birthday dinner with a large party and I would say this was a great experience. The vibe definitely makes me feel like I'm in Old Town but more chill. They have a very nice environment and it's pretty dark. The menu is plentiful and lots of great choices. Starting out my party ordered the eggplant and the shishito peppers. The peppers were really tender and paired with a really flavorful sauce. We just ended up ordering a huge mix of appetizers and entrees and drinks throughout out the night. The chicken karaage was really good, dip it in the sauce with the shishito sauce. The rolls were delicious and fresh. I will have to say when ordering any steak I highly recommend telling them to go easy on the salt cause they literally emptied the ocean on all the steak dishes even including the mashed potatoes. If you guys ever wanted to get a kidney stone in 2 minutes this is the way to go. No really, everyone in my party agreed that the dish was seasoned with someone's tears. Besides that, I can say that this was good place to eat, and would recommend.  10/10 would go again.",

The ambiance is amazing and overall experience with service was fast and each staff member had a smile when passing by!  The food was very tasty, had a beautiful presentation, and was a good portion size. The price is a little high but that's what you get for a high end sushi place. If you are in need of great service and a face with a beautiful smile, for sure I recommend Kristen!!!! She's freaking awesome! Hope my review helps!",

    "text": "I don't know, I guess since Sushi Roku is in Oldtown's W Hotel, I thought it would be like much of Oldtown and like many fancy restaurants that are in hotels -- overpriced, overhyped, overdone, overconfident, overworn, overtired, overcrowded, overburdened, and overextended. Overall, however, I was overjoyed to find that it was none of these things.   While it certainly aims to be swanky and has some of the classic Oldtown vibes (i.e., the genre of electro-wavy, deep-melodic, bounce-step house music was definitely playing; there's aesthetically adventurous lighting; etc.), none of that became overbearing (had to toss in one more \"over-\" word). Ultimately, the environment was a nice lively place to eat dinner on a Friday before going out. Also, the food was very solid and that is the important part.  My friends and I started off with garlic edamame. The amount of garlic on these bad boys is aggressive, but, as a fervent and rabid garlic slob, I enthusiastically support it.  Then we split a bottle of sake and some beers. Though sake-lovers, we were all sake-neophytes. Thus, we put our sake-lives in the hands of our server (I believe she said her name was Blair) and she made a fantastic decision that led to us drinking some pear-flavored sake. Marvelous.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll, which obviously didn't reinvent the wheel but was exactly what I wanted, expected and then received. No complaints. Additionally, I ate some yellowtail nigiri and some amberjack nigiri. The amberjack had like a weird lemon-thing going on, which I thought I may enjoy but, unfortunately, found somewhat off-putting. However, that is just the classic case of me ordering incorrectly. So, no foul. The yellowtail nigiri, though, = straight fire-flame-swoll-bang-bang-pow. So, hell yeah.  Lastly, our server Blair (I really hope I am remembering her name correctly) was top-notch. As I already said, great sake selection. Anyone can do that though (except, obviously, me or anyone I was with that night). What set her apart was the complimentary green-tea shots that she hooked us up with because we were celebrating. Blair's the best.",

You can park in the hotel parking or there is easy to find free street parking right outside.   I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The ambiance was perfect. The 5 of us sat comfortably in their round booths. There were plenty of other parties in the restaurant but honestly, didn't even feel like they were around. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. There was never a time our glasses were not full, recommendations were amazing, and never a dull or awkward or intrusive moment when he came by to check on us. He always seemed to have perfect timing.  As for the food, we ordered a little bit of everything: cold and hot appetizers, steak, wagyu beef, sushi, sashimi, and sake. The fish is so fresh! The amount you pay, is definitely for quality. My favorite has got to the the wagyu beef and toro. Second was the oysters and chocolate lava cake.  Nothing negative comes to mind when I think for Sushi Roku. If you are looking for quality Japanese food and a good night out, this is your place.  Tip: Monday night - 50% off bottles",

But really.. for the price, I'd never go back.. its super expensive for what you get. And my teeny bottle of sake was double what it would have been at a restaurant in SF (and triple just buying it at a store).  The staff was nice, everything looked pretty.

    "text": "Were they out of their minds when they gave this place more than two stars?  Have they never had sushi before?  Have they nothing to compare it to?  Is this what desert dwellers consider good sushi?  Gag me!  Whose brilliant idea was it to place the sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant, and to seat every sushi bar patron with a loud greeting in Japanese as they were led to the bar as if they were royalty?  It was cute once or twice, but all of us sitting at our table by the entrance did not appreciate the fake sentiment by the end of our evening.  It was downright annoying.  While ordering, our server asked if we had ever been to Sushi Roku before in such a manner as to suggest that it was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  When he indicated that their food is served \"family style\" we initially thought that it meant that we would share dishes, which wouldn't work too well when five out of seven of us were vegetarians.  When he explained that it simply meant that the food is brought out as it is completed by the kitchen, I pointed out the fact that what he really meant is that the kitchen is not organized enough to assure that we will all eat at the same time.  This is unacceptable at a so-called high end restaurant.  I had to laugh at my vegetarian dinnermates.  They all ordered a tofu dish with what they called brown rice risotto.  After tasting the dish, which tasted like fried water, I understood why they thought the edamame was so good.  It's the only thing, other than the overpriced wine, that they actually tasted that night.  As for myself, I went for the sushi assortment, or should I say, the rice cakes with slivers of raw fish placed atop them.  I guess not enough raw fish survived the trek across the desert.  The fish was carefully rationed. I actually took one of the rice cakes and put all of my sushi on it to make a rainbow roll.  In the end, the server was right.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience for me.  Meaning, I'll never go back there.",

I mean I do come from San Francisco, where you can find some of the most amazing, mind-blowing, met in your mouth sushi... so maybe I am biased. However I can name plenty of other sushi spots in Scottsdale where you can get bigger, tastier rolls for the same price or less (like Sushi Brokers, for example).   Including our tip, the bill was about $150.... For two people!! We ordered miso soup, an appetizer, a bottle of wine (that was half off because of a Sunday special they had going on) and 4 rolls. Now I don't mind paying $75 per person if the food is outstanding, but these rolls were below average and I didn't leave feeling satisfied. Nothing to write home about.  Save your money and hit up Stingray or Geisha during their happy hour. Or, head on over to Sushi Brokers or Sushi on Shea in North Scottsdale but don't waste your $$$ at Sushi Roku. It's totally not worth the over priced menu!",

The cocktails were much better this time around, and cheaper, thanks to Happy Hour :)   Our server was very friendly and fun, and even brought a complimentary round of champagne at the end of our meal to celebrate the bachelorette party. Sushi Roku totally won me over this time, I'm glad I gave it another shot.",

    "text": "I will say this, the sushi, once you finally get it is amazing so the two stars is for the sushi only. That is about all the nice things I have to say.   I was here with a very large party for a friend's birthday. She warned them (and I do mean warned them) in advanced that it was going to be a large party so you would think that we would have maybe 3 or 4 servers for a party of 40. (not kidding on that number either) So the two servers we had were ok. I would usually name them by name, but alas I won't on this occasion because the service wasn't the best. I am not blaming the servers as they not only had our party of 40 but other tables as well.   Anywho, my gripe is this. For a busy Saturday night, you would think that they would have enough people to handle all of the people that were at this restaurant. The bar was super slow, the sushi bar was well slow. Let's just say everyone else in our party of 40 were almost finished with their sushi by the time myself and another young lady finally got ours. Yes again , it was good, but wow, it took a very long time. We only had three rolls between the two of us.   So don't got with a party larger than 6 max! I watched other tables with smaller parties get their food and drinks at record speed so size does matter in this situation. If you go, go early before it gets too busy so that you won't wait for your food or your drinks. Oh and it is a little pricey so be warned. I have no problem paying for good food, as long as the service is just as good. Catch my drift?",

My husband and I recently went to Sushi Roku on a date while visiting family in the Scottsdale area.  We are quite particular about the flavor and freshness of our sushi, but love to try new places when we get a chance.  We decided to go to Sushi Roku based on a recommendation from a friend who has been there.  We were SO glad we did!  The sushi was so fresh and flavorful and the presentation of the food and the service were just as wonderful. We also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant itself.  We chose to sit outdoors in a booth and the Scottsdale weather and the lighting were just perfect for an evening meal.   If you love sushi, you should definitely try this place.  We will definitely go back every chance we get.",

Granted, it was Saturday night and the place was fairly busy, but come on...  After we FINALLY got our bill...gulp....the prices are very high...we ventured upstairs to the open air lounge which is nestled near the W hotel's pool, which I've heard is an experience all in it's self. Lounge was small and a little noisy for us 30+ yr olds...LOL!   Nice experience...would return again.",

Went there for a Saturday lunch with only few people around and enjoyed the seating outside with such great weather, so the overall ambient was totally 5 stars.   I will check it out again at night and see how the scene likes ...   As for the food, me and my friend shared two of the lunch bento boxes with a variety of food from miso soup, salad, tempura, teriyaki, sushi to roll and dessert (green tea and red bean ice-cream)... Food was ok, not a whole lot to rave about. But again, this type of restaurant, you go there more for the atmosphere than food.  So in that sense, it met my expectation.   Will recommend this place for a night-out, or date place",

They have a fun offering of cocktails, and a decent wine list too.  Our table indulged in several sushi rolls, edamame, and other mains. Go for the panko crusted salmon (2 of us split the entree, and it was plenty), and pass up the beef skewers (they tasted *off*, and were ultimately sent back and taken off the bill).   After dinner, we were escorted by the restaurant manager to the velvet roped hotel lounge area where there was *LIVE* music.   SO FUN.",

Three of the four times I've dined here, the drinks came after the food.  The front staff are friendly but some of the staff was down-right rude. I've worked in the service industry for years and cannot believe the attitudes of the servers.  One of the servers lied to us and told us they were out of pitchers because she didn't want to sell $15.00 pitchers.  The manager actually admitted that she lied and there were plenty of pitchers.  She also lied on our tab and took advantage of a large table who would have tipped more than 30% had she been honest and courteous.  The food I would rate, okay.  I find that they don't use the best ingredients and inexpensive soy sauces, etc.    I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.  If you want bad service in a convenient W Hotel location, go for it, but Roka Akor far surpasses Sushi Roku.",

We got there in time for happy hour and enjoyed $5 appetizers and discounted rolls.  I had a bellini, my husband had a beer and we had a ton of food to share between us.  Delicious.  A little bit more on the pricey side, but very fresh and tasty.

We almost turned around and left because of that, but I'm SOOO glad we didn't. The service was amazing. Very knowledgeable, fun waiters. The place is gorgeous. My cocktail was top-notch. But the SUSHI... OH MY GOD. It was AMAZING. The best sushi I think I've ever had even outside of Arizona. Extremely fresh. Made to perfection. Melt in your mouth, delicious, truly authentic sushi.

Ok... the sushi rolls are just average. The Katana roll was puzzling in that it reminded me of a manufactured sushi roll offering at my local grocery store... it was NOT even interesting let alone compelling. The tuna/avocado roll was much better... simplicity is their strong suit. The tuna belly (Toro) was SUPERB! What's not to love? The surprise of the evening were the Brussels Sprouts. Order these 1st with a cocktail and study the menu. They are the perfect starter.  Note to self: I'll stick with the sushi in the future and forego the rolls. The guys behind the sushi counter know what they're doing... and the fish is uber fresh! But most important - I'll ask to sit at one of Tim's tables!",

They should shut the place down until problem is taken care of.",

    "text": "Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.We had a reservation for 530PM at this establishment, mainly because we couldn't have one for 5PM. It may seem early for sushi, but we had a show to go to and did not want to rush. We arrived a bit early hoping we could get seated a bit early but that was a hard stop. No way that you get seated before 530PM. I find it a little odd, but sure whatever.   The place is very nice, and adjacent to one of the most awesome lounges in the city (the lounge of the W). It is a premium spot and they have turned it into a nice place. The service is good and on par, however we did feel that it was a massive up-selling from the waitress. She suggested very elaborate and large creations when it was clear that we already had our minds made up in what we were having. A bit pushy, not too bad.  The food was amazing. I mean I feel I know sushi, and this was very very well done. Every roll was distinct from each other and never did I feel it was vinegary or otherwise flawed. The only thing I found a little strange was that we were the first to sit, and the place was at low capacity and yet our food came out over a long period of time. Now we were all sharing and talking so no real issue, but imagine if someone truly only wanted something in particular... they might have had to wait until the end of the whole dinner.    With that said, I will come back here though. It is a bit pricey, but for celebration or whatnot it is a very thorough experience and worth the cost.",

Everyone at my table had been drinking, except me, the night in question.  We ordered up, I collected cash from everyone, and I paid the balance on my card.  When we got the bill back to sign - I noticed it was a little light.  10 dollars was missing from the cash amount.  What ensued was a debacle of the waitress trying to tell me that I counted the money wrong (I didn't) and looking around under the table for the missing money.  I have seen this scam before, and I am sure it works great on drunk patrons.  Not so great on sober ones.  I didnt want to waste anymore time so I just took the 10 bucks out of her tip and we headed out the door.  She chased us down to tell us she found the 10 dollars under the table.  The same one we just looked under with flashlights while she was inside.  I have told several friends about this - and I dont think we will be back.  I can only imagine how many other people have probably been ripped off like this.  After all - it's only 10 bucks, who will notice?  This cheap bastard.  That's who.",

We checked in at 7:10 and were told it would be a few minutes before our table was ready. Within those few minutes, we were asked 3 different times if we had checked in. I'm unsure if this was a one-off because it was busy due to the holiday. In any case, we were seated closer to 7:30 and ordered right away as we knew exactly what we wanted. It was 7:45 before we got water for the table and 10 minutes later, we finally got the bottle of sake we had ordered.   We ordered 2 ramens and only one came out so we had to wait another 15 minutes for the 2nd bowl. The sushi and sashimi were pretty good. In short, the kitchen and wait staff seemed overwhelmed and service was definitely lacking.   3 stars for the food and the effort!",

My first cocktail was very pink and too sweet but I really liked the lychee mojito.  As for the food, it was more fancy fluff and flare than tasty. We had edamame, a bunch of rolls, the fried rice, and three or four desserts.  In my opinion, not one thing stood out as being great. Particularly disappointing was the grilled octopus. It's usually one of my favorite dishes and I was thrilled to see it on the menu but it was flavorless and a bit chewy.   I might go back for cocktails but likely not for food.",

We had the katana roll, the salmon carpaccio, Kobe skewers and quite a number of sushi pieces. You can check the pictures.   Although the decorations were quite amazing, I didn't really come here for the decorations. I guess you can say you are paying for the atmosphere, and if you really like the atmosphere, then it is worth your value.   However, I am more of a value of food kind of guy. I felt that I have tasted sushi exactly the same as this at other places that cost probably half as less. And I think I've tasted sushi better than this at other places half as much as this. I guess what I'm saying is the sushi is overpriced.   They have fancy names and probably have fancier presentation. If you break it down, it just tastes like every other place really.",

The karaage was ok, good texture but lacking a bit of flavor. It needed a good squeeze of lemon and a lot of the aioli.   The lunch deals are pretty good - we had the chirashi and an unagi donburi. The meal starts with miso soup, which is good but did not come out very hot and was cool very quickly. The chirashi (regular, not deluxe), had a pretty standard selection of fish on it. Everything tasted fine but nothing was very special (but also, can't really complain at the $17 price point). The unagi was a little better - 6 decently sized pieces of unagi that tasted pretty good, but definitely benefited from the eel sauce (needed extra for the rice as well).  Overall it's a pretty standard sushi place as far as I'm concerned, and I'd try others before returning here.",

My review is more of 3 1/2 star mostly because the inflation on very basic sushi. You definitely go here for the scene, not necessarily for amazing sushi.

Loud music in the bar clashing with louder music in the adjacent lounge bar- the cacophony is ear-aching and makes conversation impossible. Servers are friendly- but understaffed for the crowds on a Friday night. The place is a scene- and not in a good way.  Food had a few hits, but the quality wasn't good enough for the price. - Seaweed salad ($11)- this was pretty fantastic, loved the different mix of seaweeds - Organic garden salad ($11) had potential, but drowning in dressing - Uni pasta ($19) super rich with an odd sweetness, one bite was more than enough - Miso eggplant ($10.50) came out nice and hut, this was really tasty - Roasted cauliflower w/ red dates ($12) good, but a small portion for the price - Kimchee cucumber salad ($6.50)- big chunks were awkward to eat and a bit slimy. pass. - Senshi roll- ($16)- not impressed, small without much flavor  Will leave this place for the masses.",

    "text": "Swanky vibes, delicious eats and half off bottles of wine on Sunday. It's safe to say that Sushi Roku was a great experience!   Not many other restaurants in the area are open late night on a Sunday, so this was one of our only options when hunger struck at around ten pm. I went here because I was staying at the W, but if you are in the area and are craving solid Japanese food I'd say it's definitely worth going out of your way. Especially if you want some quality late night eats.   If you aren't a sushi lover then don't fret. The menu has a ton of meat, noodle and veggie dishes to choose from. I started off with miso soup. Prices are definitely steeper than your average sushi spot (what else could be expected at the W?). 7$ for miso soup is hefty but this was honestly some of the best miso soup that I've ever had. For my main I went with chicken fried rice. The portion was absolutely huge and came with a ton of high quality chicken and was topped with lots of fresh scallions.   When I passed by on Friday + Saturday night it was very crowded, so I'd suggest calling ahead for a weekend dinner. There is also a nice sized outdoor seating section with heat lamps.   Prices are high but so is quality and portions are big. Would definitely recommend.",

The Katana roll was very tasty,  expertly prepared and quick to my sushi bar seat. Perhaps marginally overpriced at $19.50, but includes three W hotel premium.    Kimchee cucumber sunomono also very good,  although came out well after sushi.  But,  I'd rather have sushi out quickly so not too concerned.    Pleasant desert choices from chocolate volcano cake to michi, to s'mores.  The frozen lemon souffle was delicious.     Esteban's service was attentive and engaging.

My wife and I went for lunch on a Monday - the place was almost empty at 12:30.  The first demerit was the fact that they had the AC turned down to 60 degrees.  Ironically, the doors were opened wide to the patio as if they were trying to cool the desert  - the electric company must love them.   We decided to stay warm and sit outside on the patio which fronts Camelback Rd  - pretty busy and loud with road noice (second demerit).  A salad, a roll, four sushi (8 pieces) and water to drink plus tip was almost $70... quite a bit more than your average lunch.  I would not have minded if the sushi was outstanding, but it wasn't.

I ordered a blackberry smash which was nothing short of wonderful.  I definitely could have ordered a double.  Another person in our party had a cold sake that I found was soo good, I had to try it twice.  Our waiter was very friendly, down to earth and low key.  Amongst us we ordered some sushi, I ordered the Ji-Dori chicken and the other person in our group ordered the Braised Pork.  Apparently they were out of pork so that was not available which was a disappointment.   Food was out at a decent time and the sauce with the mushrooms and potatoes had a wonderful zing and afterbite.  Our sushi eater had his eyes rolling back the entire time with his head agaisnt the booth so I can only assume the experience was nothing short of orgasmic.  We only had a small snafu with a groupon discount, but that was corrected without issue.  I'll be sure again to come to try the pork and have multiple blackberry smashes.  Even though I have not been won over to try sushi, I'm more than willing to have this restaurant experience again.",

(And it was an awesome Groupon)  The place had a very nice atmosphere and decor, and we went a little earlier so it wasn't super busy.  I always feel bad for the servers that get those groupons because I know some assholes dont tip very well when bills are discounted, but our server Zach, was upbeat and very helpful in helping us pick out menu items.  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The spicy tuna on the rice cake thing was soooooooo good.  This place is definitely pricey, but if you can afford it, its definitely worth it.",

The service was great, the waiter was very nice and helpful.  Sushi, I only had the california roll, but they do use real crab, plus their wasbi was really good, soo much better than Stingray, which in my opinion is over priced and not worth, and the rock thing, seriously, I don't know of any Asian that has a rock on their kitchen counter to set their rice spatula at home nor for their chopsticks.  I tried their Kobe sliders, I've had better at Roka.. I think if you are going to the W and the restraurant enjoy the sushi, serivce and maybe the drinks, but everything else, is up to you for review.",

On the odd occasion when I have, it was good not great which is why I can't with a clear conscience give it five stars. Also the Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio and Yellowtail Diced Chilies appetizers are amazing. We usually get two of each of those as well. If I could just rate the appetizers I would give it five stars all day long but like I said the entrees were just okay. The margaritas and martinis are tasty but a bit pricey and not very big.

I still prefer Nobu, but this chain is very comparable.  I had the usual mix of what I like: edamame beans, unagi sushi, a sashimi mix, rolls and their rock shrimp.  I first fell in love with rock shrimp at Nobu, and I think Sushi Roku does a very good version of it!  Tasty and good sized potions.  The fish has a nice flavor and texture.  The rolls were good quality - we had a spicy salmon roll (not on the menu but they allowed the subsitution), tuna toro with jalapeno, and a dynamite.  This place is pricey but I was happy with the meal and service and would return.",

    "text": "I'll admit I went here out of convenience, 100%. I was staying at the W for a conference, needed to get some work done, so I got takeout and took it up to my room. I got three pretty straightforward items: edamame, yellowtail sashimi with diced chiles (supposedly a \"specialty of the house\"), and the tuna jalapeno hand roll - and was underwhelmed with all of them.   The texture of the edamame was off on about half of the pods I got - grainy and not moist at all. The pieces that were prepared well were actually delicious, with just the right amount of salt. But WTH, why was half of it wonky?   The yellowtail sashimi was completely overpowered by the sauce it was covered in. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were good, just completely imbalanced. Way too much sauce, and somehow, something with diced chiles didn't even have a hint of spice to it. The yellowtail was sliced so thin that it was unrecognizable even as fish, and the sauce effectively cooked it. This is a dish I particularly love, that my favorite sushi restaurant at home serves perfectly, so I was very disappointed.  These two dishes behind me, I move on to my tuna jalapeno roll. Based on its name, I'm expecting a very clean, crisp roll. When I open the box, I am accosted with huge dollops of spicy mayo on top of each piece. I dab it off so that the roll looks vaguely appetizing, if a bit smeared. I've never tasted a roll so bland in all my life. Apparently that's why it was swimming in mayo - to give it some flavor. Also, it was supposed to come with toro, but they were out of toro and subbed regular tuna, but charged me the same. Toro is a lot more expensive than regular tuna, so I wasn't thrilled about that, but I was expensing dinner, so the cost was really didn't matter.   That said, if I was actually spending my own money, I definitely would not spend it here. Yeah, I'm not from Arizona, I've always lived by some water, so maybe this is the best you can do here, but I really doubt it.",

Sushi Roku, which means sushi 6, after the 6 chefs that started it, has both the bluefin belly as well as the choice cuts from the rest of the fish. The bluefin (Nigiri or Sashimi) will set you back $24 for 4 pieces of the choice cut Hon Maguro or $38 for 4 pieces  of the otoro belly. There's the master chef \"Makuto San\" who has a rotating staff of 5 assistants that he supervises. The master chef was born in Japan, and unlike most of the sushi chefs in Arizona, is actually Japanese and not Korean. They actually have REAL Kobe beef at Sushi Roku, which is also next to impossible to find. When ordering Kobe anything, please pronounce it \"Ko Bay\" not \"Ko Bee\" like a certain moron who's parents are too dumb to name their son properly. When ordering Sake, either Salmon or the drink, please pronounce it \"Saw Kay\" not \"Saw Key,\" you will avoid sounding uneducated. Remember that the best Sake alcohol is served cold, not hot and comes in several different varieties as wine does, and has subtle changes that will please pallet. Please enjoy, it's a great place to eat.",

I dined here with a girlfriend and we sat at a hightop table by the bar which was a great place to see the bartender making these unique drinks that entailed fire. We had to know what they were! The manager came to our table and told us all about this speciality drink which was Sushi Roku's take on a traditional drink, the Old Fashioned but with a twist that included smoking the cocktail glass with a cherrywood charcoal before pouring the drink in. I decided to try one with my favorite whisky Crown Royal; the smoky flavor mixed with the sweetness of the cocktail was delicious! I ordered asparagus wrapped with filet, which was another delicious treat! I cannot wait to return to see what other tasty cocktails the mixologist behind the bar has up his sleeve, and to enjoy another great evening with excellent food and excellent service.",

Was glad to get out of there and get to the \"Living Room\" at our hotel - the W Scottsdale where Sushi Roku resides.    Tip: if you stay at the W you get a card for a free \"appetizer tasting\" at sushi roku. This ended up being just an amuse from the chef that they \"took off the bill\" because of the card we received - and after lots of questions about what we liked and didn't like - 2 meatballs came out as the amuse. That is NOT an appetizer tasting experience - it was an amuse - which in nashville means super cool thing a chef makes that is free and makes you happy. NOT the same at Sushi Roku.

But last weekend I had dinner there, and it's definitely worth a try.   The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant inside a W Resort in Scottsdale. It's hip and trendy. If you hate the Old Town crowd, you may want to avoid this place on a Friday/Saturday night.   The staff is super friendly. We had to wait a few minutes for our table (even though we had a reservation), so we hit up the bar. The bartender was really good about recommending some of their specialty drinks, and explaining what was in it. When we did get to our table the waiter was really good about guiding us through their menu.   This place serves a lot more than the standard rolls you find everywhere else.  We had a Toro and Jalapeno roll. Excellent. Exactly what it sounds like.  A garden roll. Really good, it had a Mizuna sauce (think spicy mustard) which really enhanced the flavor.  And a Crunch Spicy Tuna with Avocado. I was a fan, and I'm not usually too thrilled by tempura.   The fish was all fresh and fantastic. Prices were a little more than most places in the area, but nothing to complain about. I would recommend anyone hit this place up with a group before heading over to the bars and clubs in the area.",

Their sunset menu before a show at the Gammage Theater was the perfect excuse. Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options. I went with my sister and we each tried something different off the menu and shared. For starters we got the edamame hummus and garden salad. The wonton chips with the hummus were so good and the salad was so light and refreshing.   For the second course I got the vegetable tempura and popcorn shrimp. Both of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp. The vegetable tempura was good but a bit heavy before the final course.   I got the salmon as my main course and my sister got the filet. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I didn't need the rice and the sauce was slightly too sweet for me. The filet was so good with a great teriyaki sweet sauce and perfectly smooth mashed potatoes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice. Not super crowded but we had an early reservation. I want to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

To top it all off I was forced to pay 20% gratuity for avaerage service.",

Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place!  The bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant...  I would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !",

Other sushi joints give you double the portions for the same price, if not half the price you'd pay at Roku. Quality was right on par with most other sushi bars. I did feel like I was being hounded to 1) buy a drink, 2) buy edamame, or 3) order more sushi (which many people probably do, considering the portion sizes).  I'm unlikely to return to this venue, unless I begin to miss the decor and snotty valet people.",

I had ordered their \"premium homemade tofu\" three ways (truffles, caviar and lemon oil, scallions and sesame oil).  The tofu had this sourness that concerned me about its freshness...and then I literally spit out the truffle tofu because it had a rotten taste to it!  Bleh!!    I wasn't expecting great Japanese food in Phoenix, but I thought Sushi Roku would be a good bet since it's part of a group that has restaurants in SoCal and Vegas.  Wrong bet.  The king crab miso soup tasted like the instant miso soup you buy at the grocery store with old frozen crab stuck in it.  Ironically, I had thought it'd be safer to minimize the sushi since I'm surrounded by desert, but the spicy scallop roll was the one item that was actually wasn't bad - nice chunks of scallops that weren't overly sauced.    I've had decent sushi/Japanese food in Phoenix before...but it was definitely not at Sushi Roku.  To add insult to injury, they charge high prices for the bad food and slow service.  Thank goodness I didn't get sick after eating that tofu!",

    "text": "This place never disappoints. I've eaten at  both the Los Angeles and Pasadena, CA location. The Scottsdale location did not disappoint!  The decor here was nicer than the other locations, still rocking that chic and hip vibe that the W hotel and roku restaurants always have. We came with a large group of people, so we ordered a ton of dishes. Here are some highlights and must haves: 1) yellow tail with diced green chile: paper thin slices of hamachi bathed in a yuzu sauce topped with tiny pieces of diced green and red chile. It was delicious as always! 2) spicy tuna on crispy rice: i always order this at every establishment that offers it on the menu and I find that roku does it the best. The rice it's served on is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and comes out warm. It's piled on high with spicy tuna that's bursting with flavor and heat.  3) miso marinated cod: this is another dish I always order when it's available. It's not as good as Nobu Matsuhisa's, but still delicious. The fish is so delicate, it flakes apart easily with a fork and melts in your mouth releasing the flavors and sweetness of both the fish and miso marinade. Absolutely delicious! 4) Chilean sea bass: this is another really delicate fish that had great flavor and served nicely seasoned sauted spinach.  5) crunchy spicy tuna and avocado roll: tuna and avocado with tempura flake crust 6) spicy tuna and shrimp in rice paper roll (I forget the actual name of it): the rice paper gives this roll a unique and delicious flavor.  7) rock shrimp: tempura style mixed with a sweet sauce.   8) mixed seafood tempura: the batter was light and flaky. The scallop and asparagus were my favorites.  9) edamame (soybeans): made al dente and came out steaming hot to our table lightly salted. Delicious!   Everything here from the service to the food to the ambience is great. This place rocks!!",

    "text": "Sushi Roku (and the adjoining Scottsdale W Hotel) is the type of place that you either love or hate. It's a total scene, with well dressed, beautiful people jockeying for position and pulling every string they can to bypass the line, get seated immediately, etc. etc. So, my advice to people is to know what you're getting into.....go with the right mindset....and enjoy yourself, because it's quite a show!   There are two different atmospheres to Roku, so you DO have a choice. The main dining room is fun, loud, and buzzing with activity. This is where all the action is. The only thing is, don't anticipate a deep, meaningful conversation with your dining companions. Yell some small talk, sip your drink, and enjoy the food!  The upstairs open patio is another story. While it definitely doesn't have the buzz of the main room, it is filled with large booths and tables, overlooking the W's pool deck. This is a MUCH more tranquil experience, allowing you to enjoy your conversation without straining or yelling.   The food is very good. And, for what they charge, it should be. It took me back to the couple of times I've been to Nobu........some of the best sushi I've ever had......some of the largest dinner tabs I've ever had, as well.   The appetizer selection is large and there are daily specials. On our last trip we tried a Tuna Tartar special, as well as their \"Hanabi\" Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice Cakes. Both are excellent. For dinner, we stuck to rolls, focusing on items such as Tako Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Katana Roll....all involving the adjective \"spicy\"....what can I say? We like it spicy.   On a previous visit, some main courses hit the table. The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent, so don't be afraid to order off the Entree Menu if sushi isn't your thing.   Lastly, the service is wonderful. We've been twice and everyone has been great to us. You are never left wondering where your server has gone and their GM, Seth, and the other managers are constantly making the rounds and ensuring that everything is to your liking.   All in all, I'm a fan of Roku. Beautiful setting, beautiful people, and the option of submerging yourself into the scene downstairs, or enjoying a quieter meal on their new patio.",

I had edamame, a california roll and a shima roll -- shrimp wrapped spicy tuna w/ cilantro and avocado.  They were both fresh and excellent.  The nice part was that I could see the sushi man actually making them about 25 feet away.  Nice!  I did think they needed more creative sushi rolls but was definitely happy with the two that I had.    The place looks great.  Nice tables, booths, everything.  A little dark with the lack of lighting but I'm fine with that--I know my dad would have complained about how hard it is to read the menu.    For hotel guests, I guess they serve non-Asian food here for breakfast and lunch.",

(be honest! if you dont like uni say so!!!, if you normally eat rolls try omakese at your local sushi spot befor trying it here!! ) the chefs here have a strong head chef that teaches not just cutting techniques for the numerous fish that other sushi bars nearby dont carry, but also about how to best \"service' the guest.  if your expecting super fast rolls and unrealistic low cost, you made the wrong decision.",

    "text": "Surprisingly I'm going to give 4 stars to Sushi Roku.  Here's why...  Being that it was my first time to this location I was SUPER skeptical because it sits at the W hotel in old town Scottsdale, which is nice but, it's a restaurant, not some hot Sushi/club scene that came here from LA as people portray it to be.   So I was smart, I went on a Monday night when I knew the affliction and UFC crowd would be to a minimum and the staff could actually concentrate and relax instead of bustling around rushing because of a shouting, rude clientele.   Not to my surprise the experience was exceptional, the staff was hands down friendly, confident in the chef and on track with recommendations including a delicious pairing with a bottle of chilled sake.   I opted for the steak wrapped asparagus to begin and the stimulus menu for a main course.  To those who don't know, the stimulus menu is a 3 course meal served for $30.00 where you can choose either \"Land\" or \"Sea\" and yes, it's okay to mis-match them too.   I had the \"Land\" as my first course which constitutes 3 of the restaurants most popular items, steak, chicken, etc and all were prepared absolutely to spec, well except maybe my steak was a tad cold but meh, everything was going awesome so far so why screw it up by complaining.  The second course however I had the \"Sea\" version in which 4 different pieces of nigiri are served with 3 different types of roll, also note, you can substitute fish in case you aren't feeling shrimp or whatever they serve you, a total plus.   Third course is green tea ice cream, always a winner in my book.  To sum it up I'd say this location met my expectations with what I had become accustomed to with the LA locations, I'll be back for sure, just never on a weekend, not in Scottsdale at least.",

    "text": "I was en route to Japan, when I flew over the W hotel in Scottsdale. I looked down and noticed a bunch of cool tables and booths located next to the sidewalk. I couldn't make out what the sign in front said because I was already at 2500 ft. and ascending. I asked the guy next to me if he knew, and he said \" I'm in the middle seat, I can only see wingtips you moron\".  So I made a mental note to myself  to find out which restaurant was located there. 2 weeks later, I had returned. I found out that it was Sushi Roku. I thought to myself, there's no way it could it be as good as the sushi I just had in Japan for the last 2 weeks. Well, Ive only been wrong 3 times in my life before the day I ate at Sushi Roku. Now I can honestly say Ive been wrong 4 times. I had no idea how fantastic everything is here. The decor blew me away from the get go. It's an interior designers heaven. Very modern and clean. I was floored by the warm greetings and smiles my wife and I received right as I walked in the door. Now then, there's sushi and then there's Sushi. The Toro sashimi I had was so fresh, I thought it was gonna swim right out of my mouth!! I mean Harrow!!!  Everything from the Filet Wrapped Asparagus to the Shima roll was fantastic. Ironically, our servers name was Ross too. Classic.  He was able to answer any questions we had, and he also suggested several menu items that we ended up ordering, which lead me to write this review. God he was impressive. Fantastic experience overall.   I cant wait to go back!!",

Breakfast service is not the best at all and is very slow. The food is amazing though. I've had the Huevos Rancheros multiple times and they are so good. They are not definitely what I would expect when you say Huevos Rancheros as I am from a very Hispanic hometown, but they are delicious.   Dinner service tends to be better as I am assuming this restaurant is made for dinner. We had a handful of rolls, Miso Soup, and the Asian BBQ Shortribs \"Yakiniku.\" By far the only stand out item was the Beef Skewers! They were to die for. All of the other food was definitely average to me. I have definitely had better sushi in Dallas, Austin, and Atlanta. For the price point I don't think this would be a favorite restaurant of mine, but for the convienence, it isn't horrible.",

I've eaten sushi & sashimi all over the world and looked forward to trying Roku Scottsdale (we've been to another location and were underwhelmed but thought we'd try again). We were staying at the W and based on their website (silly me!) we thought we'd give it a try (from the W website: \"Voted \"Top 10 Asian Restaurants\" by Arizona Republic, Sushi Roku, our Scottsdale restaurant, pushes the boundaries of modern Asian cuisine with a dazzling array of fresh sushi, luscious salads, thoughtful appetizers, and an extensive selection of hot entrees.:) Top 10 Asian restaurants? Pushes the boundaries??? Dazzling array???? Me thinks not so much.... The yellowtail with diced chilies (aka jalapeno slices) was the best dish we had, I would recommend that. OToro was quite good, the rest? Not memorable (I can't even recall what we had). We had ordered salted edamame as a starter, however, it came out after we finished all of our sashimi and sushi and it was burned, actually inedible. Great 1/2 price Sake deal mid week was a nice touch though. Again, the chefs and the servers were excellent, but I would recommend Kodo Sushi & Sake in No. Scottsdale WAY more.",

I got the softshell crab, spicy tuna and yellowtail roll. Very filling but was definitely still hungry after spending ~$60. The sushi portions are very small, and it's probably best to combine it with something a little more carb heavy.   Although it wasn't very busy in the restaurant, service was a little slow.

I'm leaving this review because the manager, Mr. Mike Kirsch, gave me and my friends amazing service. Simply top notch. I had friends from out of town that were visiting and they thought I was a VIP of some sort because of the attentive service I was receiving. Everything on my order was correct, and compliments to the chef as well (I believe it was Joey).   The popcorn shrimp was simply amazing. The timing of our different orders getting to the table was perfect! I would recommend Sushi Roku in Scottsdale to anyone and will be taking all of my visitors from out of town here so they can receive the same level of service I received from other members of the Sushi Roku team, including Mr. Kirsch (I hope I spelled that right haha).",

I am guessing the restaurant was short staffed, because there were 15-20min stretches where we wouldn't see our server at all. It took an hour before we were able to place our order, and the food we did receive was delivered over a 45min span - and we didn't receive everything we ordered. It would have been more acceptable if the server and/or manager would check in and explain that the kitchen is behind, but we were left to wonder what was going on, which obviously led to frustration on our part. We decided to cancel the food that we were still waiting for because we were fed up with how long it was taking, and hit In n' Out on our way home so we could actually have dinner. Maybe others will have a more positive experience, but we will not be returning.",

After we were walked back to the front, it took over 10 min to wipe it up and get it set up. Only giving us 2 menus for 3 people. Ok - I can deal with that...but the rest of the night went downhill!  It took a while for the waiter to come to the table. When he did, we ordered drinks & water immediately.   The bus boy finally came over with only 2 waters!??  Cocktails took over 45 minutes!  We were asked to order from the kitchen cuz the sushi bar was backed up!  What - we want sushi!  Food took forever to come! Almost sent the cocktails back since they took soooo long!  Our last order of 1 roll and 2 hand rolls took over 45 min and when the waiter came back he said they hadn't even started it yet. He had a look like \"maybe you people should cut your losses and leave\". Our order never came out so we decided to leave!  The manager actually came out and told us the waiter mentioned our issues and he gave us a discount. Really? It was honestly the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant.  He didn't want our take on the night?  After leaving we heard from others that they also had TERRIBLE service!  Needless to say - we won't ever go Back",

Service was a little bit on the slower side but the sushi was fresh and tasty. Downside of the night is when we ordered mochi for dessert (chocolate, green tea, and passion fruit) and it took 15 minutes from them to bring out the mochi but in the flavors green tea, mango, and Sakura. When I told the server who wasn't our waiter that we ordered different flavors, he then proceeded to tell me they were out of chocolate and that Sakura was their passion fruit (Sakura for the record is cherry blossom, not passion fruit). While still delicious, we did not appreciate the switcheroo and then the attempt to convince us that Sakura = passion fruit.",

The management is great there as well and if it's your birthday the hook up the desserts.  The yellowtail with diced chilis and ponzu sauce, steak wrapped asparagus and popcorn shrimp with miso sauce are our go to apps.  As for main courses there are too many to choose, but you can't go wrong with the sushi rolls and the jalapeno and sriracha rolls with tuna are amazing.  And for dessert you have to go with the assorted mochi ice cream. The best flavors are pistachio (when available), passion fruit, mango, and blueberry.  Enjoy!",

Although we were hardly bothered by the wait, the manager came by to apologize for the inconvenience, and even sent us a few free appetizers. He stopped by several times to see how we were doing, and our waitress made sure to make the night as special as she could for our group.

    "text": "We checked out Sushi Roku at the W for a fun night out with friends and sushi.  The restaurant was surprisingly quiet with an almost empty dining room. The dining room itself is serene and lovely and we were seated in a comfy half-moon banquette table perfect for our party of 4.   Our server (whose name I am forgetting and I'm so mad at myself!) was excellent - she had a wonderful, fun personality and gave some great suggestions on items to order.   One of our party is on a very strict diet and asked for vegetable sushi rolls. The server was initially hesitant about this as the way that they usually make vegetarian sushi is different than what my friend was requesting. However, she went to the sushi chef to see what could be done and he was kind enough to accommodate the request. Not only that, but the vegetarian sushi rolls were beautiful!   We started with delicious yellowtail with ponzu sauce and chiles - it reminded me more of a carpaccio because the yellowtail was very thinly sliced and a bit scarce to find amongst the other elements of the dish. We also got an order of the shishito peppers, as they're usually a favorite of mine! Their shishitos were pretty good, but the ones toward the bottom of the bowl were somewhat greasy and were really overwhelmed by the soy garlic sauce they were prepared in.   We began with Miso Soup (good, always a great comfort food) and then got a variety of sushi including the obligatory tuna, yellowtail, and salmon as well as scallop, a roll with eel, and a spicy tuna roll. We also ordered the teriyaki jidori chicken skewers, which was tasty.   We got a few different desserts including the Chocolate Volcano (yummy, as to be expected of a molten chocolate cake pretty much anywhere) and the banana spring rolls, which were not much of a hit.  The floor manager stopped in to check on our table, which was a nice touch and something I always appreciate as we were able to let him know that our server was doing such a nice job.  Overall, service and ambiance were excellent and the food was just okay for the price.",

I will start by saying they were very quick to help us figure out a seating situation for our group of 8 which was nice. We settled on the patio which may have been the reason for the poor service or the server could have been being over worked however when we could call her name for assistance we were often ignored u til she had time to help. It took a LONG time to get our checks and they won't split them for you. You have to do it.   The way the food comes out is strange. It was all at different times and so all of us were eating sporadically and not together. The food was average. I am pregnant so I could not have the sushi but my husband said it was good. The atmosphere is definitely what makes the place. Would likely come back for a night out with the girls for drinks and atmosphere and probably skip the restaurant.",

Suddenly I saw this very nice looking lady carrying couples of plates so she stopped and came over with a radiant smile and explained the dishes and introduced her self. It was very pleasant and great she said her name is Sarah and came back to ask us if we need anything and I ask a few questions about the menu and drinks. Due to her awesome personality and warm smile we all felt like we were at home. Sarah mentioned her passion for foods and the interaction with people,  she loves to meet others and make them feel at home. I WILL BE BACK JUST BECAUSE SARAH MADE OUR NIGHT MORE MEMORABLE.

    "text": "I love Sushi and have tried many Sushi places in the area, but for some reason kept missing out on Sushi Roku...well, a nice gentleman decided to take me there for my birthday dinner and what a treat!!  We were seated at a cozy booth with a view of the sushi bar, which is perfect if you want an intimate dining experience but you want to observe the excitement of the sushi bar in action.    Our waiter greeted us right away and he was outstanding throughout the whole evening!  Unfortunately I did not catch his name.  He told us about the Arizona Restaurant week menu and the alcohol and the 'real' menu...I had major conflicts of interest!  We ended up opting for a feast of a little bit of everything Hahah! We ordered two options on the AZ restaurant week menu because the variety of the options was impressive!  Seemed like a great way to try a bit of everything since we had never eaten there!  And I had to try one of the Signature rolls; when I go to Sushi places I like to try their 'specialty' or something weird and unique!  As for the drinks I ordered white wine (Citra Pinot Grigio, Italy) to go with the mounds of fish coming our way and my date opted for kirin Ichiban beer, and the AZ restaurant week menu surprised us with a complimentary Roku Fusion Cocktail!  The Breakdown:   The signature roll we chose was the Tako Roll: Spicy Octopus; it was my FAVORITE thing of the night!  I find sometimes at sushi restaurants when they say spicy it is just more like a bit of a zing that you have to spice up with Wasabi, but Sushi Roku wasn't lying!  It came with spicy tuna dressing the top of the octopus roll and an interesting spicy reddish sauce drizzled across the top...Delicious!!! Great way to start the evening!   1st course:  I chose 'Appetizers From the Sea' because I love fish, which came with Tuna Tataki, Salmon Sashimi and Tai Usuzukuri.  And my date chose 'Appetizers from the Farm' which entailed Kobe beef skewers, Fillet Mignon wrapped Asparagus, and Crispy Ji-Dori Chicken.  My favorites from each (yes we shared) were the Salmon Tataki, which had an amazing sauce (Truffle Tamari Soy) and the Kobe Beef Skewer (black pepper sauce)...my date liked the Tuna Tataki (close 2nd for me) and the asparagus wrapped with fillet Mignon (amazing).  We both decided we would forever pass on the Tai Usuzukuri (very blah) and the Crispy Ji-Dori chicken (over fried and just blah compared to the others).    2nd course: I opted for the 5 pieces of Roku Signature Style Sushi (Tai, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Tuna), accompanied with 3 pieces of Spicy Salmon Cut Roll and 3 pieces of California Cut Roll.  It was all quite amazing and a great assortment!  I loved the albacore sashimi!  But it was all good because I love tuna in general!  My date ordered the Grilled sirloin steak \"Japonaise\" with Japanese style potatoes; it was a pleasant surprise because we both didn't know what to expect.  It was a big tender steak with a unique gingery sauce and the potatoes and green beans that accompanied it were also Delicious.  Both plates left the table empty!    And yes still going: 3rd course:  DESSERT! The waiter brought out both the Mini Chocolate Volcano and a Fresh Fruit Sorbet!  They were both tasty but we could unfortunately barely eat them because we were so full!  The Sorbet tasted very fresh and fruity with beautiful fresh strawberries.  I love chocolate, so the Chocolate Volcano was decadently rich and wonderful, in which I dipped the fresh Strawberries from the other dessert; YUM!   Oh and when the surprise Roku Fusion drink showed up we were amazed at such a great Restaurant Week deal for $30!  BTW they did not skimp on the alcohol ;)  If you ever want to try Sushi Roku, Arizona Restaurant Week is a great time to go because you get a great variety from the menu!  It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks!!  I should also note the Tako Roll (spicy octopus) was not included with the Restaurant Week special.    I know I will be back because their anniversary falls on the same day as my birthday (September 26th) and everything on the menu is half off!!! WooHoo!    And one last thanks to my anonymous server!  I hope I get to enjoy your service again! As much as the sushi bar looks enjoyable and fun; I wouldn't have traded that for such an excellent dining experience!",

    "text": "Tonight we made the mistake of not making reservations, for their 50% off sushi night. I will own up to that. But myself and two others showed up at 4:55 not thinking this would be a problem. Three cold hostesses informed us that they don't open until 5:30, and that they are fully booked. Having worked in the restaurant industry myself I completely understood the fact that they were fully booked on this night, again, my bad. They told us the bar top (5 seats) was open though, and to return at 5:30 when they open. We went to the bar at the W to order a drink. At 5:25 we walked over to the hostess stand. The first thing they said to us was that we couldn't take our drinks in. Fine, understood. But the tone again was not appreciated. Then we look and the 5 seats at the bar are FULL. I'm sorry, at 4:55 you told us we couldn't be seated until 5:30. And at 5:25 those seats are taken? I'm giving roku 2 stars because I know their sushi is good. Which is why we wanted to dine there. And again, I get that we should have made a reservation. But the ice queens at the front door coupled with the early seating when we were told we couldn't sit down, made us feel like we weren't worthy of sushi roku scottsdale.",

The bf wasn't exactly pleased as he had spent a lot of time planning the evening. The GM Steve was very gracious though, and brought us some amazing appetizers! Definitely helped to smooth things over. Everything we had was amazing. My favorite was probably the yellowtail appetizer!",

Our waiter CJ was so nice & attentive. Wine was $10-16 a glass, I got a cab for $12 & it was good. We got an array of sushi for the table, all was great. The roasted cauliflower is to die for!!!!! The only weird thing was I got the baked crab roll and it wasn't sliced, it was just one long sushi roll, sort of awkward, especially because we just had chopsticks & no knife or anything. But food was great! Will be back.",

I think because I was sitting alone, they may have felt sorry for me LOL, not realizing it was quite fantastic.  The fish was fresh, I ordered the chef's choice sushi eight piece. They were single pieces of fish prepared with ingredients that would accentuate the flavor of the pieces perfectly.  All of the staff seem to know the menu extremely well and all made similar recommendations which turned out to be epic. The brussel sprouts chips were very decent and light.

We were honored to have the manager, Kyle introduce himself and offer his warm welcome.  We savored each selection that was offered us. I am fortunate to have dined at all of the top restaurants in Scottsdale and without a doubt Sushi Roku is amongst the best in quality, atmosphere, presentation and by far, service. We will most definitely return to dine at Sushi Roku again.

We thought we were lucky... nope.  Table wasn't cleared completely, so the hostess decided to help by picking up an almost full saucer of soy sauce and dripping it all over my lap and floor. She looked at me and just turned around and walked away. She was young, and i think embarrassed. Regardless, no apology.  When i returned from the rest room the server, who took forever was visibly over loaded. Between the mediocre sushi and slow service it was actually a terrible experience. The one highlight was the sea bass, exceptional and almost worth the trip.  Overall, the experience was crowded, loud and service was slow and very inexperienced (poorly trained) for such an upscale establishment.",

I used to really like their veggie tempura but for some reason, the breading is really thick on the veggies. It felt like eating fried bread instead of tempura. The Brussel sprout chips were good when done well, but really oily and lots of burnt ones so you taste the bitterness of burnt veggies. The rolls were pretty good. The tamago was done well too.",

I ended up sitting on something very sticky and gross and didn't notice until I got up to straighten out my blouse. We sat at the sushi bar and the counter was all dirty as well. I spent 95 dollars at what is known to be an upscale restaurant but was very disappointed by their lack of cleanliness.",

Waitress came up to us quickly to take our drink order and get us settled with menus.   We decided to get the fried chicken, Brussels sprout chips, and gyoza for appetizers. All were delicious! The Brussel sprout chips and fried chicken were my favorite!   For dinner we split the pork belly fried rice, tuna jalapeno sushi roll, and the daily special which was a scallop dinner. Again, food was great. Sushi was tasty, fried rice was amazing, and the scallops were good too. A bit different, as I'm used to typical pan seared scallops, but still very flavorful.   Drinks were strong and refreshing, and overall experience great. Would definitely go back to try more!",

    "text": "No one receives five stars from me.  I narrowed down the search for sushi by searching yelp within Old Town Scottsdale for sushi joints with two $$ and below. This one fit my budget for happy hour only. After happy hour, this place is too expensive for my budget.  Here, I order several things off of the the happy hour menu. My first choice was the albacore Sashimi with the ponzu sauce. I was very impressed by the flavor of the sashimi, and the fried/crisped slivered onion strips were a wonderful and not overpowering garnish. However I felt that the albacore was a little bit too thin. Not enough substance.   Next, I also ordered the spicy tuna hand roll - and boy was it spicy! It had a very good combination of spiciness and flavor it was not overpoweringly spicy, and the roll was of a decent size. Same deal with the salmon skin roll. Nice and salty just like how I like my salmon skin, and ditto with the size of the roll. A good solid flavor to the salmon skin - good taste.   I must admit that I ordered doubles of the wagyu beef on a skewer. The beef was well-cooked, not too fatty, nice and tender, and with lots of sauce on it. The sauce was delish, and the meat was very flavorful and cooked very well (not well-done, but just slightly less than medium). I ordered two skewers, but in all fairness, may not be worth $7 each skewer.   I do slightly regret not trying out the edamame hummus and spicy edamame, but I ordered enough happy hour selections to make me satisfied and empty my wallet, so I quit while I was ahead.  Keep in mind that, at this joint, you pay for the vibe and the rent just as much as for the food and service. I gladly paid, but it's not something I can afford on a regular basis.  The staff was very attentive. I had no less than three very good looking waitresses waiting on me as well as two other waiters. My food came instantly after I ordered it within about a couple of minutes after each order. And every time they brought the meal out to me they gave a brief description of what it was that I was receiving.   All of the waiters and waitresses seem very happy and I believe they are well-paid this place is a very well-run operation the employees are very professional and the appearance of the restaurant is very good and clean.   I do like the food dear however I would limit my purchases to happy hour it also helps that they have very good music and lighting inside the restaurant which produces a very nice relaxing ambiance",

Now that I'm a Phoenix resident, I've decided to take advantage of their happy hour anytime I'm in the area.   What I like most about this restaurant besides the delicious tasting sushi is that a business traveler can get in and out of this restaurant fairly quickly in between meetings. What I mean by that is if you're staying at the W and want breakfast, this restaurant converts to that. When it's time for lunch and dinner it turns into Sushi Roku.   Staff is great here, always friendly. There are a variety of rolls and the best thing about the sushi here is that the portions are big and you never leave hungry. Try the Truffle Tempura, the tuna jalapeno and if you can't make up your mind just order the Chef's Special and you get a good variety of fresh and creatively prepared sushi. The key word here is fresh. Everything is delicious.  Little tip, if you aren't craving sushi and have a bigger budget, try the filet mignon. It's really yummy and at medium rare, it's prepared to perfection.",

I wish I took more pictures of the actual food but it was all so delicious we gobbled it up asap.   Appetizers - Premium edamame, Brussels sprouts chips, Beef rib eye wrapped asparagus, Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi  Entrees - tons of sashimi pieces, plus rolls: Crunchy spicy tuna, Shima, Katana, Tuna Jalapeno (my favorite!), Spicy Scallop.  Dessert - Smores and Chocolate Lava cake  All of it came out quick and really tasty. The wait staff was really great and made awesome recommendations (the hostesses weren't the warmest but I'll chalk that up to a slammed waiting area and Brody Jenner and some guy from the Jersey Shore being there!).",

    "text": "I never write reviews on here, but had to say something.  Granted, we had dinner here on Christmas evening, but regardless of that it was an extremely disappointing experience.  I live in Chicago and have been to their sister restaurant Katana several times and have had a good experience.  There were five of us, and we were seated at two tables put together, and they squeezed three of us on the booth side.  The problem was, the tables were different thickness so the person in the middle didn't have a level area to eat on.  They reluctantly moved us to another table, where we were ignored for ~10 minutes and our initial order of drinks and edamame was seemingly forgotten.  We finally were able to get some orders in, and our waiter was very apologetic and nice (Jacob was his name I think?). The food that came was pretty underwhelming to be honest, and after ordering apps we were informed that last call for food was happening because they were closing at 8 (we were seated at 7:30).  No one had mentioned this beforehand.  I ordered a sushi roll and some sashimi - the sushi roll came and had Saran Wrap in it (what the sushi chefs use to make sure it stays in place, so I ate it anyways) but that was pretty off putting.  The sushi chefs were cleaning up and packing up everything, and my sashimi never came, so I never said anything.    As I mentioned above, I understand it was Christmas and they might have been working a skeleton crew, but then don't have the restaurant open if you can't deliver for your customers.  Overall was a horrible experience that didn't improve at any point to be honest, and the food was very mediocre. Scottsdale has some of the best food in the country in my opinion, spend your time elsewhere.    Note:they did remove some things off our bill but it was still a $200 meal.  A visit from the manager would have gone a long way.",

The list in order of absolute love:  1) Brussels sprout chips (tossed in truffle oil) 2) Shishito peppers 3) unknown name tuna role recommended by the chef with spicy tuna and jalapenos inside and fresh tuna on top - AMAZING 4) Beef rib eye wrapped asparagus 5) Crunchy spicy tuna tempura 6) Avocado Hanabi 7) Roasted Cauliflower  To reinstate, I loved all of it. Granted this list is short on sushi and it's not that we don't love sushi, it's that we LOVE appetizers and couldn't make a single choice. But for those on a budget, you might have to make some choices, and I hope this helps. It was the perfect filling amount for three semi-hungry ladies.   The vibe of the place is perfect. It's in a hotel, and the only way I would notice was the swim suit wearing ladies at the bar. But that's not a bother to me as the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and professional. Note, the night we were there it was mostly a young, handsome, male staff. I'm not complaining just noticing.   Next time I'm in a city with Roku, I'm coming back.",

The California roll was good but standard and you get 6 pieces for $10+. This place is overpriced.",

Scoped out the menu but was too afraid to commit due to the price and my lack of success with Asian food let alone sushi in Scottsdale.  I'm from Seattle where grade A sushi is sold from grocery stores.  This place did not disappoint. Their wide selection of fresh fish is impressive along with their A5 wagyu beef. The New Zealand King salmon melted in your mouth as well as their thick slices of sashimi (yellow tail, tuna toro, snapper) gave you the perfect amount of balance of flavor on your tongue.  If you're not into raw fish, their japanese fried chicken is crispy and juicy-you really don't even need the aioli that comes with it.  I did also have their BBQ short ribs that were supposed to be Korean style. It wasn't bad but it was doused in a lot of sauce and a bit too salty for my liking. I typically like short ribs dried and grilled without being sauced.  Service was impeccable. Rene was very knowledgeable of the menu and did a great job describing the seafood items and the chefs preparation of each item. Having worked at upscale restaurants before, I'm truly impressed by this individual.   Overall good place but probably a bit outside my price range for how much I normally eat on any given day. Great value during promotions such as their anniversary week.",

Immediately I felt comfortable with the decor, lighting and layout; it felt like a place I would enjoy. All of those emotions came to fruition with our server, John. He was friendly, energetic and clearly knowledgeable and able to answer all of our questions. Then the food came brining it all together. Starting with the edamame and though out all of our various rolls, I was very pleased. With all of this said, I cannot wait to come back and have recommended sushi roku to some friends ( and to sit in John's section if at all possible)",

As I walked in, the atmosphere seemed alright but man the hostess did not know how to greet or check people in. Waited about 10 minutes and not a single effort was taken to greet us nor did she ask if we had reservations. Took a little longer to be seated and the lighting inside was too dark which didn't do well with the tiny little print on the menu. Only highlight of the night was the sushi. The sushi was absolutely delicious. The appetizer did come out after our sushi but still overall the food was delicious and well displayed. Long story story food was delicious but service could have been better.",

    "text": "Never been here before, but they were having a \"half-off\" promotion to celebrate their birthday.  Basically half off your entire bill.  Great deal.  However if I was to judge this place based on their normal prices, I'm not sure I would've considered this place worth the money.  The place is set on the bottom floor of W Hotel in Scottsdale and it meshes very well with the reputation and the vibe of the hotel.  Hip, sheik, trendy, while at times bordering on over the top.  The hostesses are screaming at the sushi bar everytime they walk their guests to their tables (sounded like they were yelling fishaaaay or something).  Got really annoying after awhile.  But I digress.  For the appetizer we got the crispy rice asparagus.  Basically an asparagus skewer covered in a fried batter of rice and peanuts.  The saltiness took me by surprise.  Not bad, but not what I anticipated.  For the main dish, we got the twelve piece assortment to share.  In reality it was more of a 20 piece dish as they served a mixture of california rolls, crab tempura, and a mix of different sashimis.  Basically reads like a greatest hits menu.  The albacore and octopus weren't really my thing, but the crab, tuna, and salmon were all pretty good.  It was more than enough sushi for two.  We washed it down with some saki of course.  For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake.  They got this one right, as the chocolate was moist on the outside and liquid hot on in the inside.  All totaled, one appetizer plus the sushi assortment, saki for two, dessert for two, with the 50% discount and tip was $55.  Great deal with the discount.  Normal prices are somewhat in line with some of the popular sushi venues I've been to (though you pay a little more for the venue I'd imagine).  Personally I like going to the small local mom and pop Japanese establishments like Hana, Tokyo Lobby, and Cherryblossom.  The prices are right, the quality is just as good (if not better), and its feels like a more authentic experience.  But thats just me.  If you're not picky about atmosphere or price and just want a sushi fix, this trendy Scottsdale spot will suffice.",

The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.  The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

    "text": "We came here during anniversary week which meant our food was half off! What a great special and they were slammed. We will definitely go back even with out a special going on.  We started off with the sashimi which was yellow tail with a spicy sauce and fresh cut cucumber and jalapenos on top. YUM this was probably our favorite out of everything. The we got a couple of rolls  - soft shell crab and a crispy spicy tuna. The soft shell crab was huge and delicious. Great fresh flavor. The spicy tuna though is part of the reason for a star deduction. I was under the impression it would be, well... spicy and, well... crunchy. It was neither. The flavor of the fish was good and the sushi itself but the batter wasn't cooked until it was crispy so it took a lot of the flavor away instead of enhancing it.   We finished the night off with tempura popcorn shrimp which was very close behind the sashimi. These things are so delicious and popable and its a huge portion that could have easily been shared between 4 people instead of two. It comes with shaved asparagus and mushrooms and the sauce is just creamy and delicious.  Our server Kristen was amazing. She was just so cute and patient with the two tables next to us (one was really annoying and demanding and outright rude and the other just needed a lot of attention).   The other reason for my star deduction is that when a new guest comes in and is seated, the hostess yells out something that sounds like \"airhsay\" (totally butchered that but I dont know how to spell it) and the sushi chefs and staff yell it back. After hearing it about 50 times during our meal and having it interrupt our conversation, you just get mad about it. Please take note staff of the restaurant...its not you guys its the yelling during the meal! Its really, really annoying.  Anyway, I was very happy with everything in the end and would definitely go back there for sushi (I have been really picky about where I eat sushi out here).",

Yes it's more California style sushi vs. traditional but more mass appeal for a place like Scottsdale.  Baked lobster roll was absolutely delicious.  Spent about $200 for 4 people, but we did have sake, wine and beer to go with our meal.  Would gladly come back.",

    "text": "We love sushi and loved the unique spin to many of the items on the menu. The food was outstanding. However, the restaurant is noisy and filled with young, \"beautiful people\", so do not come here if you are looking for a quiet romantic night. The overall vibe of the W in Scottsdale is one of snobbery and elitism, very disappointing for a W, and we have travelled to many across the country and usually enjoy attentive and upscale service. The good news is that although the hotel is lacking, the wait staff at this restaurant is exceptional and really made our evening. CJ deserves special recognition for making it a great night. It was easy to see that he loves his job- he knows the menu, helped us pick great plates to share and was friendly and engaging. Because of the food and CJ, we will be back to eat, but will stay at another hotel.",

Truffle edamame - loved it, great flavor The sushi rolls were good, nothing amazing. Shrimp tempura was also ok.  Overall food was ok/ good- nothing exceptional.",

They have a great selection of drinks, sushi, entree dishes and desserts. If you enjoy good sushi and a quiet, casual but nice ambiance, you will enjoy this spot.",

Love the booth seating and the place is super clean with a very upscale feel, it is a perfect addition to The W.  We were a party of 8 and we had reservations -we were warmly greeted and promptly seated. Solid menu which also includes non sushi options(plus GF.) We had a few apps to share at our table - Filet wrapped asparagus, Edamame, Hummus, Oysters, Seared albacore. The wrapped asparagus was delicious and tender,  the Hummus and wonton's were a big hit as well. The oysters and albacore were fresh and yummy. Besides having a really nice menu they have a wonderful selection of Sake's and Asian martini's .  I knew i would be drinking so i steered clear of having sushi for dinner, so instead i had a fabulous Prime rib served with a super yum garlic sauce, my dining companions had the sushi assortment and the Lobster, scallops and prawns ..all plates were presented well and were delicious .Service was outstanding, they really took care of us and helped to make my birthday dinner very special .  Cannot wait to return ! We all had a brilliant time.",

I was on a short trip, this time, and made it a point to go twice for dinner this trip. Logan was our server on my first trip and the first dinner of this trip. He is exceptional in his service, manners, and brilliant recommendations. My second dinner was lovely and interactive thanks to Sarah's service. She made dinner a treat by her wonderful tasting suggestions, and her attentiveness to our experience. Great work Dan, GM for making this establishment so amazing! Service is exceptional. Can't wait to return.",
