Low dim lights red velvet walls, waiters in 3 piece tuxedo suits, and entrance has you walking thru the kitchen. Had the salmon with maple glaze with mixed veggies and a baked potato. It was literally the best meal I Have had in years. For dessert I had the strawberry cheesecake and it was a huge portion but really good. The customer service was spot on and all my needs were met. This a must go place if you like the mafia style movies or if it at all interest you.",

I think everyone who sets foot in this place knows that most of the evening's enjoyment will come from the classic feel of the place (well covered in other reviews), which includes the food.    It has standard steakhouse menu options.  Nothing is super healthy, nothing is disgustingly greasy, and portion sizes are pretty average (none of this tiny food silliness, but not over large).  Preparation is great (but not fancy or impeccable).  The drinks are well made, and the service is simple but effective to match the rest of the place.  If that sounds good to you, you'll have a wonderful evening here!",

    "text": "Where do I start? It had been probably 15 years since I had been to Durant's, but the Filet still stood out in my mind as the 2nd best I have ever had (1st is at a casino in Johannesburg). When celebrating our engagement, we decided to dress up and go be classy. Durant's was the first place that came to mind.  Fortunately, we made a reservation, because the place was packed. It struck me as odd the first time I was at Durant's that you enter through the kitchen, and it still does, but whatever.  We were seated in a comfortable booth, our server was efficient and very friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu. I saw some of the other reviews slamming the service, but that was not the experience we had, nor that anyone seated within earshot of us had with their servers.  My filet was so good I ate it with my eyes closed. Slowly. It was an experience. The sides were good too, but wow, that filet...  The deserts were just okay, and we took ours to go.  I knew the costs of the food going in, so there was no surprise when the check came. Yes, it was expensive ($175 including tip for 2 people), but totally worth it, if for no other reason because of how good the filet was.  The ambiance is definitely Rat Pack Formal. I'm a fan of that kind of thing, so I liked it.  I will absolutely be back.",

On the last night of that particular trip I decided to ask around for a really good steakhouse. Everyone talked about a Durant's. Little did I know it was that adult book store structure that actually housed one of the overall coolest steak houses in the country.  You walk in through the back and right through the kitchen. Awesome! The Goodfellas decor; awesome! And then there's the food...  It's hard to say if this this the best steak I've ever had but I think it would be fair to say it was the best steak house experience I've ever had. Proper service. Legit menu with the appropriate cuts available at appropriate sizes and appropriate prices. Of course I had the ribeye. Perfect! Also had the fried liver appetizer. Perfect! Nice wine list. And I only got a gander but the prime rib at the table next to ours looked succulent.   In short, I think this is my favorite steakhouse in the country. Good prices. Great meat! Perfect service! And the same old fella, yes one fella, grilling the steaks for something like 30 years. It doesn't get much better than this.",

You enter through the kitchen, which I know people trash as being a bit of a novelty, but whatever - I'm here to have a good time so the novelty is just something fun!  Relax for the love of Todd.  It's like stepping back in time when you enter here, but not in a dirty way - in a classy way.  The waiters are very formal and super polite.  The decorating is like something out of an old mobster movie.  In fact if you're going here, make sure you're dressed up like an old-timey mobster or dame.  And it's a steak place, so order some steak why don't you?!  They have everything from petite fillets to massive monster 96 ounce beasts of meat that you get your name on a plaque for actually finishing.  When I went, it was busy, so the service was a little slow, but you're not here to rush in and out - you're here to sit around and have a good time and enjoy some drinks and delicious meat.  Also, even though the service was slow, it wasn't 'rushed-slow', it was 'relaxed-slow' and attentive, so we never felt neglected.  It's 5-stars, so just go take a look why don't you?!",

Just ask, and the waiter will give you some choices not seen on the menu.  I don't know what they put in the martinis at Durants, but nothing else compares.   Most places are so keyed into \"turning\" the room at a good clip to maximize cashflow, they've missed the ability to host a slow paced dining experience ( say a special occasion). Durant's knows how to create a memorable dining experience at a relaxed pace. The wait staff will be as \"stuffy\" or as \"relaxed\" as you let them be. They key off your personality, but always within the parameters of Durant's culture.   The creme brulee is worth it alone...but have the Prime rib too. The horseradish is exceptional.  This is a \"once or twice a year\" evening for my wife and I, but Durant's is always top notch.",

The prime rib uses a very good cut of meat, flavorful with just enough fat. The interior of the restaurant and the food presentation is definitely old fashioned. This is not a calorie conscious purveyor who uses trendy ingredients. They use good cuts of meat and identifiable cruciferous vegetables as sides. As a first time diner, my server informed me that she would be bringing me a complementary dessert. I tried to wave her off since I was so full. She brought over Durant's full serving of its signature Strawberry Shortcake. This is a huge dessert that is more than enough for two. Despite being full, my dining party polished it off. It's that good. Don't forget to try their Lemon Drop Martini with your meal.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, my husband has been three times. He went last month, spent around $120, and had an excellent experience. So we decided to go here for our 25th anniversary. The majority of the food was good, and my prime rib and his steak were excellent, cooked perfectly. But there was something really weird in the garlic potatoes- two round, black, hard things that looked like rocks. Not something I'd expect or want to find in mashed potatoes.  The amateurish service was so bad . We had both a server and another employee, maybe a busser, waiting on us. The server, who had taken our order, came out with our soup and salad maybe five minutes later, and repeatedly tried to give them to the table next to us. They repeatedly refused the items and kept telling her they weren't ordered. She finally gave up and took the food out of the room. After a few more minutes, she reappeared carrying the same food and put it in front of us like we hadn't seen everything. She then knocked my husband's cocktail onto his leather shoes.  After our meal, in which I found those black rocks, the busser came over, picked up a plate that held a full little cup of sour cream, and dropped it face down on the floor, splattering it on his leather shoes again. She then said \"Oh, I hear you've already had a cocktail on your shoes.\" So the two had discussed their clumsiness between each other, but not with their manager on duty, because it would have been nice to hear, \"Sorry we've been dumping food on you, let us comp your drinks.\" Some acknowledgement. My husband was at this point just saying \"okay, okay\" because he didn't want to further ruin things by getting angry. We ordered a chocolate layer dessert to share, and it turned out to be this weird, gummy gelatin thing that I suspect was much firmer than it was suppose to be.  So, for nearly $200, we got nice steak, scary potatoes, gummy cake, ruined shoes and clumsy service. I can't recommend this place.",

    "text": "Our visit was disheartening to say the least!  Noting their fabulous ratings on the likes of Zagat, Yelp and Trip Advisor, my wife and I were dismayed with our recent visit to this Phoenix mainstay!  Durant's does take you back in time.  Coming in through its front/back door, impresses you with the feel of walking into an old Speakeasy!  You actually meet the kitchen staff before anyone else - fun!  The furnishings, booths, table and decor are a throwback to the 50's and 60' and you feel like the Rat Pack is about to walk past your table any moment - we loved the ambience!  That being said, that's where delight pretty much ended.  We began our evening and though dinner with an excellent Sonoma Chardonnay.  Our appetizer of Fried Calamari left a lot to be desired of, where it appeared to be over cooked, chewy and its coating tasteless.  We proceeded with our meal - my wife started with a Chicken Caesar Salad and I had the regular Caesar Salad, both of which were adequate, but not worth writing home about.  I was sincerely looking forward to a fine Sauteed Calf's Liver and Onions, one of my favorite dishes I'd not had since moving to Phoenix.  I'm sorry to say it lacked tenderness, (maybe needing better preparation or product) taste with overwhelming caramelization of the sauteed onions, rendering them slimy!  As a connoisseur of a well-prepared Calf's Liver, I have discerned much better...  of all the restaurants to have this dish across the country, Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington DC is a recipe Durant's should attempt to emulate, or come close to.  I did quite enjoy the au gratin potatoes.  And our dessert of Durant's Cheesecake was satisfying and tasty.  All things said, as a Speakeasy/Lounge it'll make a great visit for Martinis and chat.  Highly recommended for the business lunch set, but for formal or semi-formal dinner or romantic evening out, it left me pondering.  It was unfortunate that my Wife's Birthday Dinner, ended up being a nonchalant and unmemorable meal.  Besides my Wife's flowers delivered timely to the table - we rarely interacted with wait staff that just zipped by hurriedly doing their thing, at other tables.  I plan on returning, but that may be a slow process.  Caveat Emptor and Bon appetit!",

Who knew there was such a gem disguised in old building with old signage in the middle of Phoenix?!!  You would expect this place to be in Hollywood.  The leddies and I started off with a round of up and dirty Grey Goose martinis from the main bartender who was working most of the bar on this busy Saturday night.  He seemed a little annoyed when I added two more martinis just after putting in an order for two, but I tipped him well and then he was all chatty.  Well played, buddy.  His drinks were awesome too...made perfectly!  We then we seated and ordered a bottle of house Pinot Noir, which was delicious.  We then got the bread, which has some amazing butter garlic sauce oozing all over the top of the loaf.  My house salad was tasty, but the star was my entree - scallops with a baked potato.  The odd thing was the waitress asked me how I wanted my scallops cooked, which has never happened before.  They are not steak...just cook them normal.  And the chef did and it was perfect.  We also got a side of asparagus, but no one touched the hollandaise sauce.  That is how good the asparagus tasted.  Our waitress was attentive and took great care of us.  Even the water girl made sure our waters were filled at all times.  Durant's - I cannot wait to come back and visit you!",

It was the perfect amount of food and such a nice touch. And the big bonus was we got chips for free lifetime dessert!! Awesome. Can't wait to go back and try the creme brulee next time!",

If Sinatra wanted a great cocktail, he would come here.   Guys order a real drink like a martini up or a Manhattan and you won't be disappointed. They have a great wine selection and even offer the majority of it by the glass.   The food is unassuming, but good. Your steak isn't going to be overdressed or or over cooked, but just right. The oysters, when in season are almost the best in town.",

They brought out that delicious leek and garlic bread....that has got to be the best bread in Phoenix! For dinner the BF got the New York with rice pilaf and I got the filet and scallops combo (fancy, huh?)...We both got the pumpkin bisque soup to start. The soup was SO good... creamy and delicious. Sweet and savory. It was like savory pumpkin pie....we both loved it. The steaks were delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The scallops were slightly on the fishy side, BUT they were also cooked perfectly and had this wonderful creamy herb sauce with them. It was like eating a deconstructed clam chowder almost. Very good. I had the mashed potatoes with my meats and they were creamy and flavorful. The filet melted in my mouth. Despite the fact that we were both stuffed beyond belief, the restaurant graciously offered us dessert on the house for our anniversary. We got the brownie pie on the recommendation of our waiter. It was so rich and wonderful. Two brownies with nuts sandwiching vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and chocolate in a pool of chocolate sauce....ridic! The only problem with this place is it is very pricey....it isn't a place we could go to all the time for sure...but for a (very) special occasion, this place is top notch!",

And Durant's did not disappoint. This is the real deal for sure: think dark leather booths, heavy wood furniture, a dimly lit bar - yes, you MUST order the dirty martini....the froo froo stuff doesn't cut it here. As you look around the dining room, you think about all the stories the walls must hold. The service is some of the best we've experienced - very attentive, but not overbearing. They know the menu and will help guide if you'd like. And the steaks were out of this world!. To keep with the old school tradition, they serve a relish plate before your meal. Totally 60's and 70's....I love it that they have held on to this tradition. In my line of work, I do a lot of business dinners that are usually held at the usual ho-hum fancy-schmancy steakhouses. To me, they all blend together....Once you're inside you don't really recall WHICH of the many there are. Durant's is a unique place with a lot of character; a True legendary steakhouse. I will go again and again.",

I arrived 45 minutes before my reservation and, though I offered to wait in the bar, I was seated immediately at a table that happened to be open. My server Rebecca was also very attentive--she saw that I was struggling to slice my steak and immediately brought a sharper knife.   This place definitely isn't cheap. I had the 12-oz Prime Rib with baked potato side, glass of pinot noir, 6 oysters as an appetizer, coffee with Bailey's, and the creme brulee trio for dessert. My tab was $88 before tip. I didn't realize until I got my bill that the sauted mushrooms that \"came\" with my steak were a $5.50 upsell. Sneaky!  Tip: Much easier to access the valet parking lot if you come from the cross street--not the street of the restaurant's actual address (sorry, names are escaping me).",

The parking lot is too small for valet service, although large enough to park without issue.  Anyway, on to the food and service.  The service was off the charts excellent.  Thank you Alonzo. The food was phenomenal too.  Prime Rib with \"Atomic Sauce\", Chilled salad with REAL dressing (not out of a bottle), calamari cooked just the way I like it, and a slice of Key Lime pie to finish it all off.  It is rare when as I write a review I start to get hungry all over again.  :-)  Not only is this place a Phoenix landmark, it is old-school fine-dining as well.  If you come to downtown Phoenix as a visitor and do not go here, you will be missing out.   Full Disclosure: I do not, nor have I ever worked at Durant's, nor do I know anyone that works there.

No big deal, since we were all sharing, but that did mean I had to ask for coffee. I wouldn't be the person in a crowd to suggest the restaurant, and if I were to go again, I'd stick with a salad, since it's supposed to be served cold.",

    "text": "A trip in a time machine! An old school, classic, classy Phoenix  dining experience! Love the semi-circle booths, great wallpaper, huge pots of flowers and candles. We went for lunch, I had a dinner salad and the open-faced roast beef sandwich, thick sliced. I don't  eat the bread, so this was great! I also got sweet potato  fries instead  of the garlic  mashed potatoes.  They fries are crinkle cut and ok, but the skinny fries at Vig and Red Robin are better. I had veg- carrots, zucchini& cauliflower,  they were plain and boring, but we were served a small round loaf of bread that was delicious, it was served with a melted butter/garlic/herb/leek mixture poured over it, YUM!! I dipped the veg in it and wahla, awesome!  My lunch mate had the French dip sandwich, it was huge and perfect! We ordered the trio of creme brule- mixed berry, Baileys  and chocolate,  if you are a creme brule lover like me,  skip it...I was very disappointed.  They were  ok, but $9, very  small and flavor, eh! Our waiter was very nice and accommodating! I must say the hostess was a total idiot! We were the only people in the dining room in a booth, we were  ordering dessert and a second couple came in. They were seated at the table in front of us, facing us, it was like having dinner together!  Facing each other, so close we could hear each other essily. Really, only an idiot would do that. It is NOT about convenience of staff, it is about comfort guests! Especially  at these prices! 2 dandwiches, 1 orange juice, 1 wine, 1 dessert,all in the lower price  range was $74, could have been much more.  Was  it worth that much, not really for the total experience. But had to do it once.",

You know, the kind place where John Gotti would show up in lapels smiling ear to ear having just completed another hit.  The decor, the staff, the presentation of the food is right out of the 1970s--but I love it.  Even though the salad didn't look attractive, it was fabulous.  The house dressing was so light and delicious.  The homemade bread/foccaccia with olive oil and scallions was magnificent.  Finally, I had the prime rib, my friends had the ribeye and the filet and all three were deliciously juicy and tasty.  I will definitely go back.  It's not chic or expensive looking like Mortons or Capitol Grille but that is also part of the appeal.  I must add that it was fun having my Portland friends in town and after a great steak dinner we finished the evening at the US Airways Center watching the Suns mop up on the Trailblazers.

    "text": "This was my first visit to Durant's, the storied, central Phoenix restaurant that provides diners with a snapshot of 1950s and 60s Arizona power, politics and culture. Our guide, a relatively recent transplant with close friends who are long-time residents with strong ties to Phoenix, ushered us into the establishment through the kitchen. Although Durant's main entrance faces  Central Avenue, the preferred entrance after nearly 67 years of operation remains in the back.  As we stepped out of the kitchen into the main dining room, it took my eyes a few seconds to adjust to the mid-century steak house motif. Red wall coverings, dark wood, high-backed leather booths and subdued lighting still reflect a time when the proprietor, local gambler, Jack Durant presided over the smoke-filled, backroom center of Arizona legal, political and economic power.  It's impossible at this point to separate fact from fiction, but whether the restaurant's fabled mob connections are accurate or not, nobody disputes that Durant's was a favorite watering-hole for the rich, famous, and politically powerful.  Although Durant died in 1987 and the locally celebrated film starring Tom Sizemore, \"Durant's Never Closes\" -- <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FLXZQBsHevkg&s=d9884d344fa1494bf4c5f3cf89807f5d3801a41b7f89b1f1691cf2bf124de77f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/LXZQBsHevkg</a> -- chronicling his role in Phoenix history is barely a footnote on IMDB, Jack Durant and his restaurant still captures our imagination as we gluttonously ignore the advice of our cardiologist to become one with this bigger-than-life slice of Phoenix history.  Just off the plane and not yet hungry enough for a stroll through this carnivorous wonderland, the three of us opted to share a Grilled Shrimp & Dungeness Crab Louie Salad ($38.25). Recognizing that our waiter was tied-up at another table where he was patiently guiding a mother/daughter team of tourists through the extensive luncheon menu, another member of the waitstaff took our beverage orders.  Although smoke-free today, little else has changed since the Surgeon General's early warnings eventually snuffed-out the last cigarette and expensive cigar at Durant's and I was eager to try one of their classic martinis. The result was a perfectly chilled, ultra-dry, Bombay Sapphire  martini ($14) served \"a little dirty,\" in a classic martini glass with four blue cheese-filled olives on a small plate. My less adventurous companions ordered a wonderful glass of Sauvignon Blanc and Iced Tea, respectively, but unabashedly requested a sip of my martini.  When our waiter was able to break-free, he stopped by to reassure us and returned with our drinks and a wonderful, freshly-baked bread dish presented in a sea of melted butter, olive oil and herbs to complement our drinks.  Although our server may have secretly viewed our decision to split an entree salad three-ways with disdain, he complied without the slightest hint of emotion. Likewise, our request to substitute a Continental dressing (roquefort or blue cheese layered over a vinaigrette with a hint of balsamic dressing) in lieu of the standard Thousand Island dressing usually associated with a \"Louis\" was met professionally with exactly the right questions to assure no errors on the part of the kitchen. Crisp, and perfectly chilled, our salad was topped with three large grilled shrimp and supplemented with generous servings of shrimp meat and dungeness crab. This was, hands-down, the best entree salad I have ever consumed.   We topped-off this perfect luncheon experience with a generous slice of New York Style Cheesecake ($10) and coffee. I'm a cheesecake snob, and while my view of a perfect cheesecake can only come from the kitchens of either Carnegie's or Katz Deli in Manhattan, I found the flavor, if not the texture of Durant's version, spectacular.  Leaving a well-earned 25 percent tip for our shared entree salad, modest bar bill and shared dessert tapped my wallet for a C-Note, so there's no other way to say this: \"Durant's is expensive, but worth every penny.\"  While I may need to save my pennies, I'm already looking forward to dinner at this fantastic slice of Phoenix living history.",

The interior is as other yelpers note, a nod to the rat pack era, with dark accents, tufted back couches, and lush red wallpaper. It has a very unique feel that you don't really see in Arizona, where most businesses are so new that everything looks more modern.  When we were seated we were served a chilled crudite platter and bread with a flavorful leek-garlic mixture. After browsing through the menu I went for the 12 oz prime rib (~$38) and I also tried some of the rib eye. The prime rib is some of the best that I can remembering eating. It was so tender, flavorful, and juicy. Cutting through the meat was like cutting through butter it was that tender. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and very flavorful.  We ended our meal with a divine strawberry shortcake. It was the perfect amount of sweetness, creaminess, fruity flavor, and definitely a big plate so it was good that 4 of us were sharing it!  Service was impeccable as drinks were refilled constantly, our server was warm, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu, and a manager even stopped by to chat with us.  If you ever want to indulge in a perfect steak, this is the place to be.",

Their lunch menu is great, staff is friendly, and the whole Good Fellas vibe is pretty cool. If you want great food, and a taste of history, Durant's in Downtown Phoenix is a must see, feel, and taste... All the Feels.",

    "text": "The Durant's experience is great from the start when you walk through the back of the kitchen into the dining room, It makes you feel as though you are part of the Rat Pack stepping into an Old School Steakhouse. Service is on top of everything but they allow you your space so you can enjoy your company, which in my opinion is a hard balance to find and they find it perfectly! Classic Cocktails are extremely well made with me getting a Washington Apple Martini and my Husband getting and Old Fashion. To start we had oysters Rockefeller amazing and crispy chicken livers great but needed to add some salt. The Caesar salad was a perfect balance of dressing and lettuce and not too fishy. The prime rib 12oz which must have been closer to 18 oz and a 22 oz bone in rib all the meats where great mashed potatoes, baked potatoes and onion rings were all great. We shared the NY cheese cake which was great but the raspberry sauce was a bit over powering , next time we will just get it no sauce. All in all after going to every other steakhouse in Phoenix ie maestros, Dominick's, steak44 and others I find that Durant's tops them all with just the best overall experience.",

Only two steakhouses I can recall compete with Durant's, one is the famed Peter Luger's in Brooklyn, NY (extremely expensive and in a league of its own), the other, an Argentinian steakhouse in Tijuana. Everything here is delicious, the blue cheese dressing is exceptional, you are greeted with an ice cold tray of scallions, black olives and radishes and the bread comes smothered in the most delicious concoction of garlic, shallots and a few other alliums. It's pricey but worth it.",

As you enter through the kitchen you're greeted by the kitchen staff. Suddenly you feel like a high profile guest being ushered in a back way to avoid the paparazzi. The whole atmosphere is reminiscent of a 1940's steak house. Of course, the McLaren 720s parked outside was an indicator of things to come.   This is truly a place to go for outstanding food and service but it is VERY pricey. It's not kid friendly and there's no kid's menu but, if you don't mind the cost of the meal, children are indulged by the staff and exposed to superb food, including some amazing desserts.   A sad statement about the world we live in today is the shockingly shoddy way many guests were dressed; shorts, jeans and t-shirts were commonplace. This for a restaurant that describes itself as classy and dressy attire is sad and detracts from the experience.",

I say \"kind of\" because when you're walking in, there's some AC that hits you with a wallop.  Not to mention the outside area doesn't smell amazing, but that's probably being a bit picky.  The ambiance is very dark and romantic, but I would DEFINITELY recommend when you make a reservation, requesting one of their booths.  We were stuck in a smaller two-seat table that felt fairly cramped.  We were also next to a loud group, and put in the bar area next to TVs, which felt a bit odd for such a nice steakhouse.  Service was great, as were the drinks (my wife and I had a glass of wine and a martini).  I thought the Prime Rib was delicious, but the Ribeye was MUCH better.  For sides we tried the Crab Mac and Cheese, which was tasty, and also had some pretty basic side salads, a baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes.  The bread they serve is great, but they also serve a chilled assortment of vegetables, which seemed a bit random.  Overall, I would choose Mastro's or 'Ben and Jack's' over Durant's. It's delicious, but based on our experience, I would say AZ has better options.  ENJOY!",

I took a handsome fella here the other night to celebrate his birthday and we had a superb time.  Our server Angela was on top of her game; very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great unobtrusive service.    We started with the oysters Rockefeller (my half sans bacon, thanks for being accommodating!) and they were killer!  Each of our entrees came with soup or salad (we each got salads which were pretty standard), then for our main course I ordered the 8oz fillet and he the 12oz.  They were cooked to medium rare perfection and seasoned just right. The dinner was great, but unfortunately we were too stuffed to try dessert. I know, I'm surprised too...  Next time, I might skip the appetizer to save room for some dessert!",

Here, you pay in the $40 range and you get delicious garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, a large cut of meat, all without having to buy a bunch of sides. Of the three times I've been here, every single filet I've ordered has been cooked to a flawless medium-rare. And their BREAD. It's soaked in leek and butter and garlic and something else; probably the best bread I've ever had at a steakhouse like this. I'm not usually a fan of bread-y foods, but this is worth breaking a low-carb diet for.   Staff has always been personable and friendly and all had been there for over a decade! Talk about employee retention. And it shows in their knowledge and overall outstanding service. Their cheesecake is a must-try.

The restaurant has been in business since 1950 and the experience shows in the menu, service and ambience.   Whether you hang in the bar/lounge or are seated in the luxurious leather booths, you will be treated to an exceptional lunch or dinner. To start, the service staff throughout the restaurant were outstanding and made you feel welcome, this includes the staff in the kitchen as you enter the restaurant through the kitchen, a nice touch.  All of the food served during our restaurant week dining event was cooked to perfection and delicious. I will have to return with my wife to try their steaks. Although, my wife did enjoy the 12 ounce prime rib (8 ounce was the restaurant week special but she wanted to try a little larger portion) definitely was in the top three of the best prime ribs we ever had in our life. A restaurant week special that I hope they keep on the menu was the halibut, juicy, flakey pieces as you cut into the perfectly cooked fish, outstanding.   We were with another couple for a 7:30 dinner reservation on a Saturday night and never once felt rushed during the meal, another huge plus. Definitely looking forward to returning for one of the other steak choices soon! Enjoy!",

I looked over at Mike who was eating salad also and asked him, hey is your salad wilted, at first he said no then a moment later he said it is..I said that's because its pre made  and sat, it was only 630.. On our way out the door we went thru the kitchen and to the right were all the pre made salads, go figure.  The service was amazing, and I love the atmosphere at Durant's. But the food was off way off and for the price you pay the food should be impeccable and my salad should not be slightly wilted.  It's steak, potato and salad. Come on Durant's gets with it.",

    "text": "We've lived in Arizona for more than 30 years, and yet, we'd never gotten around to eating at Durant's. Perhaps it was the conflicting Yelp reviews, ranging from \"fabulous food\" to \"way overpriced,\" and from \"superb service\" to \"the worst table side service ever experienced.\" But last weekend, it was my wife's birthday, and we decided that we needed to find out for ourselves what Durant's was all about. Walking in through the kitchen instantly reminded me of the film Goodfellas (but far less intimidating). We had made reservations for the dining room (although you can also dine in their bar room), and upon arrival were promptly seated in a terrifically cozy booth. Our waiter, \"Jet,\" was inspirational. He is the kind of person who genuinely wants you to have a great experience at Durant's, not just enjoy the sumptuous food. Taking stock of our surroundings, I felt like we had traveled in a time machine. The understated 40's style decor featured deep leather booths, dark, slightly masculine wallpaper studded with photographs of the owners, their dog, a smattering of well known celebrities, and of course, several picturesque nods to the Rat Pack. This was a restaurant Frank Sinatra would have blessed. Durant's is the real deal, the way steakhouses used to be, serving up sizzling platters of perfectly broiled beef and cold Martinis. We chose the prime rib, cut thin (English style so that we savor the salty, beefy flavor of the meat). It was superb, on par with Lawrey's in Beverly Hills and Chiacgo. Surprisingly, the entrees included salad or soup, potatoes prepared in various styles, and a gorgeous loaf of bread smothered in mushrooms, garlic and butter. The martinis were big and ice cold. And because it was my wife's birthday, Durant's invited her to order any desert on the menu, complimentary. Nice touch! She chose the Creme Brulee trio, which was fantastic. Even with 2 cocktails and coffee, our bill was under $100. On the drive home we talked about returning to Durant's to sample their lunch menu in their beautiful bar (very romantic).  If you are reading this Yelp review, and you have never been to Durant's, then by all means, go there. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Wow! The myth of Durant's didn't disappoint.  I recently came here for a birthday dinner with my boo. Neither have us had eaten here before. You enter from the back through the kitchen, which at first was a little awkward but in retrospect was kinda neat.  The whole restaurant is like taking a step back in time. Even dressed up by my standards I felt underdressed. I looked around hoping one of the diners was a gangster arranging a deal or something. It's very neat with it's lavish decor and big leathery booths.  I had made a reservation and we were promptly seated. We ordered some drinks, all of which were delicious. My vodka martini was expertly mixed, as one would expect.  Clearly - we ordered steak. We had two cuts - I did the New York Strip (EXCELLENT)! My boo opted for the porterhouse - that's right 48 oz. of beef. Watching him pain through it was worth the price in and of itself (the waitress even helped egg him on by assuring he would be the first member of their \"Porterhouse Club\" for 2015). So, next time you're in, check out the 2015 plaque on the wall.  The experience was everything I could have hoped for. I can't wait to have a reason to come back!  The only thing I don't get - why isn't Durant's listed as a steakhouse?",

I know.  Problem #1 - You walk through the kitchen to get in. No hair nets. I shed like a mofo. Not sanitary for me.  Problem #2 - Its bright ass Arizona and they keep the lights to DIM and sporadically. A waiter handed me a little flashlight when I said loudly, WTH I can't see! LoL Like really, a menu is shoved in my face and my eyes aren't adjusted to the dark.  Problem #3 - We're a big group, about 25. So do they seat us where the long bench along the wall is? No. We're split up in 4 and 5 along the other side in booths.  Problem #4 - I work for the gov'ment with gov'ment pay. The cheapest item on the menu was 13.95 and there was only two different plates. And yes I got water with my meal.   I got the Chicken Salad on Crossiant bun. It was egh and the tomato's are thickly sliced. So much so that I just gave up and pulled it from the sandwhich and tossed it to the side. I do not exaggerate. A few coworkers also pulled the tomato slices from their meal. The sweet potato fries where the best part of the meal! Crinkle cut and if all I got was a big pile of these, I would've enjoyed my meal.  The special was some type of meat on a huge salad. THAT looked good! But not for $21.00!! My tablemate also got a chocolate cake at the end, $10.00!! She shared it and a we thought it was a bit on the rich side.   I felt like I was at a Casino. I don't gamble, my tribe doesn't get any money from them and I'm not lining other peoples pockets. So I hated it. No windows. No clocks. A coworker said it was more like a horror movie. LoL Which sucked since we were in the back and no exit near us.  I was told the bathroom's were very small. Thank goodness I decided to hold my pee, because I already hit my quota for small bathrooms that week and banged my head. LoL  It seems I have NOTHING good to say about this place!!! But there is: the servers were attentive for the most part. They dropped the ball a couple times but for our large group, I can understand why.  Would I go back? No. Maybe if I won the lotto....maybe...",

I have been told by multiple people that I \"had to try Durrants\". We ordered an old fashioned and oysters to start. (This is the reason i am giving this review two stars instead of one). The oysters Rockefeller were amazing and I highly recommend them! Also, I haven't had a good old fashioned since I moved to Arizona, and the bar tender really knew his bourbon and the drink was outstanding. Then we put our dinner order in.... I got the 18oz ribeye and my uncle got the bone in ribeye. I asked for Mac and cheese instead of soup and the same for a side. I was instead served clam chowder. My uncle is a huge chowder fan and was excited to try it. I let the slip up go and decided to go with it as well. It was like a bowl of salt with some clam on top. Our waiter noticed we didn't eat any of the chowder and we said politely it was salty, and nothing was done about it. Next the steak came out. We both asked for mid rare. My uncle was rare, mine was medium. Also, I am a salt-aholic. I am that guy who will eat steak with a salt shaker in my left hand to make sure every bite gets a portion. The steak came out to the table overly salty to my taste. Also, the cut of meat was flabby (not marbled as it should be, I understand it is supposed to be fatty, that's why I love ribeye). This was fatty in the \"I bought the cheap one at Wal-Mart kinda way. For a 166 dollar bill, I will not be back.",

With the dim lighting, deep leather booths and red wallpaper, I half expected to see Frank, Sammy and Dean breaking bread in the back corner.   I was there for a business lunch, so I couldn't go TOO crazy. I ordered the \"Fat Man's Special\" (because I'm a Fat Man), with the thick cut top sirloin. It included salad and sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables. The steak was very tender and huge (I only ate half), served up with horseradish and Au Jus. The warm loaves of garlic \"covered\" bread were an amazing accompaniment, as well.   While the steak doesn't hold court with the likes of Mastro's, Dunant's oozes the charm of days long gone.

    "text": "Every major city has a restaurant like Durant's. Old School place, been around for 50 years, with red leather half circle booths, red velvet wall paper, dim lighting, old-time professional waiters with grey hair, and expensive food specializing in steaks. You walk into Durant's from the back parking lot, through the kitchen; not because of the light rail construction out front, but because that is how it has always been done. The logo awning and valet parking is back there in the rear!   Most steaks are in the $40 range, which comes with a choice of potato styles (baked, garlic mashed, fries) and a choice of soup du jour or house salad (Caesar's Salad is $4.50 more, but it isn't the old school with anchovies or mixed at your table by the waiter with wood spoons like some classic restaurants like this do it. It is mostly just sprinkled with cheese. I long for the real Caeser's salad, not this version remeniscent of casual dining places that serve it with chicken!). Seafood selections are mostly in the $30 range. They offer Delmonico steak (In-Bone New York) for $41.50; the 8 oz Filet Mignon is $40.50 (they have a larger 12 oz, too) and the in-bone porterhouse of 32 oz is $72!  A large Shrimp and Crab Louis entree is $24.95. Spinich dip appetizer is $8.95, and a dozen oysters on the half shell is $24.95 (6 for $13.95).  All the food is good, but not fantastic given the prices. Service was very deliberate bordering on slow (from the kitchen , not the waiter).  They have a decent wine list. House wines by the glass include the Santa Barbara Avila Merlot, lighter and simplistic, at $6, and the Sterling Merlot from Norcal is $9, with more body but only average.   Drinks may default to premium brands if you don't specify at the bar. Myers Platinum rum and coke, $5.50. Tanqueray and Tonic, $6.00. Stolichnaya Raspberry Vodka and Tonic, $10.95. They do serve the drinks very stiff, though!  The best thing about this place is the bread. They serve a round loaf of sourdough like bread, sliced and soaked in olive oil and covered with minced garlic and basil. It is free and they will keep bringing more as you wait patiently for your other dishes. We had 3 loaves.   They offer typical classic desserts for this type of place, like Key Lime Pie, but we were so full with meat and bread, we passed on it.   This is the place you bring your significant other's parents to impress them with a classic, great old school restaurant, especially if they listen to Frank Sinatra and like meat.  But if you are a trendy chic diner, you should pass and try something fresher in ambiance and food but equally expensive (think Scottsdale's overblown newer mega-restaurants which are the new Durant's except with Sushi or Asian Fusion, or oversized Southwest flavored creations with names taken from Cactus varieties.)",

    "text": "Holy sh*t.... Who knew Phoenix could hold it down like this when it comes to food?  I've been to better steak houses, but most of them have been out of the country.  Let's start at the beginning.  We pulled around back to where the valet parking attendant was and the first thing that struck me was that in order to get inside from the parking lot you have to walk through the kitchen.  But the kitchen staff was used to it and even said a hearty hello to us as we walked in.  It was refreshing to see such openness in a restaurant; I wish more places pulled this tactic as it certainly set the mood.  And obviously, it got me in the mood to eat as the walking through the kitchen just forced me to smell the beautiful aromas of cooked cow.  I was salivating after the first 10 seconds of visiting this place.  And then the next part of the evening that was unexpected is that they don't allow people to use their cell phones.  Our waitress saw a member of our party on the phone while we were eating our appetizers and she approached him and politely told him that cell phone conversations were not allowed during dinner.  Wow.  How refreshing was that?  I mean, I'm one of the worst offenders of using my cell phone (for texting) during dinner... but to know that I wasn't allowed to lifted a weight off my mind.  Again, this place continued to set the mood.  And then the steak.  Oh  my  God.  If you're an atheist (like myself), the steak is nearly good enough to make you pray and give thanks and praise to the almighty.  If you're a Jew, you might just start to contemplate the second coming of Jesus.  If you're Hindu, you might start to think there's something to this whole monotheism thing.  My point?  It was a purely religious experience eating my bone-in ribeye.  I only managed to eat 1/3rd of it because it was so much and it was still incredible.  If you're in Phoenix, run DO NOT walk to Durant's.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go.  Wow.",

    "text": "This is a fantastic restaurant that is also a piece of our local culture and history.  First, I have to admit I read some of the other reviews before writing this one. While almost all rave about the place, I haven't a clue what glitch in the universe caused the two complainers to have bad experiences. I've been to Durants countless times over the years, often for special occasions. Not once did I have bad food or bad service.  I'm writing this review fresh on the heels of my most recent visit. The occasion was my mom moving to Phoenix and my wanting to introduce her to life in our fine city by taking her to one of its dining legends. After telling her a bit about its history, she really wanted to go despite my warnings that it's primarily a steak and lobster place, of which she eats neither. Durants did not disappoint.   Our waiter was outstanding. Not only was he polite and efficient, but he was charming and made my mom laugh several times. While at the table we chose not to drink any wine, sticking with non-bottled water only. As a water afficionado (not to be confused with \"water snobs\" who only drink the expensive bottled stuff), I can tell you that I don't know where they get their water from but it is tasty. It can't be Phoenix tapwater because we all know that Phoenix tapwater tastes like, well, poo. If you're wondering why I'm so fixated on the water, I was additionally very impressed by the fact that the instant my glass became half-empty, a busgirl would appear out of nowhere and quickly fill it right back up. I drank a lot of water, so she did this at least 5-10 times during the evening.   The decor and atmosphere were fabulous, and my mom was fascinated as most are upon seeing it the first time. Major political schemes and business deals by Phoenix's power brokers affecting our whole state have been hatched on the back of napkins in Durants. That's the kind of place it is, and that aura sinks in the moment you walk in. We happened to sit in a booth underneath a portrait of a dog. When my mom asked my waiter who the dog was, he explained that the late Jack Durant (google and read up on him at the Phoenix New Times website if you want some background) always had a dog by his side during his life, and this particular one was his during the 1970s (the waiter was more precise but I forget the dates).   The food was top-notch. The beef barley soup I started with was yummy, and I don't particularly like beef barley and wasn't expecting much. I skeptically ordered the coconut shrimp entree, something I'd previously only tried in Hawaii. It was damn good, and the shrimp were huge. My mom ordered salmon with salad and loved both of them. Every meal comes with free bread and Durants own basil sauce, and I wouldn't even mention such a trivial thing unless it was worth it, which it is. The desserts sounded delicious, but we were so stuffed we dared not order any.  In short, the whole experience from start to finish was first-class. They treated me and my guest very well and gave her exactly the lovely introduction to Phoenix I had taken her there for in the first place.",

Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.  I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.  I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*",

The three separate times I've been were riddled with lackluster service, improperly prepared seafood, and meat with the wrong temperature (medium means medium, right? or has beef fallen into the \"rare is the new medium\" fashion continuum?).   I remain altogether unimpressed. I would, however, hide here if the law was looking for me. It's just that kind of place.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. All of the Yelp reviews I saw before going paint Durant's as a place of mystique, a place where old traditions and dining styles thrive and don't change, even as \"fusion\" and \"new American\" restaurants surround it. I definitely felt the mystique. I definitely experienced the old traditions and dining styles. I just don't know if I loved how traditional Durant's was. Maybe I just expect that expensive restaurants will wow me with their flavors and need more from a dining experience than the old American formula of a protein and starch, especially when the starch isn't particularly memorable or flavorful.   Don't get me wrong. There were some great things about our experience at Durant's. The overwhelmingly red decor was romantically retro (although I can see it being an awkward color to be surrounded by while on a business lunch), the cream of mushroom soup was creamy and delicious, my lobster tail was huge (albeit a little dry), and our dirty martinis were huge and mixed really well. The service was also very professinal and attentive. However, sticking with an established approach to dining shouldn't mean not being attentive to quality, and I felt like for the price we spent, certain things (like my husband's salad and steak, as well as the pretty terrible rice pilaf and mashed potato sides) could have been brought into the 21st century or at least made more tasty!   As the dinner came to a close (we were there at 9 or so on a Tuesday night), we got to be parties to a very interesting conversation between a woman sitting at the bar and the *very* old-school bartender. She said that she had lived in Phoenix for 35 years but quickly moved to ranting about her daughter, who she claimed was \"gorgeous,\" a part of the \"happening Scottsdale crowd,\" and a former flame of Derek Jeter's! She even offered to bring her to Durant's and introduce her to the bartender. Wow, what a girl (if she does exist). This woman also had opinions on a variety of other subjects, including cell phone providers, and didn't stop talking during our entire main course.   This little dialogue (monologue?) made me realize something, though. Times change. Women who probably used to have meatloaf or roast with a baked potato and spinach for every meal are now sitting in restaurants talking about their daughters dating baseball stars and how bad their cell phone reception is indoors. I figure if they can get just a little bit \"with it,\" so can Durant's. No major changes necessary - just a slight stepping back and re-evaluation of the menu to decide whether rice pilaf would be worth swapping out for a roasted asparagus. I'm not trying to be a traitor to a timeless institution or asking that it change its essential character - I just think that a few little tweaks here and there would keep the local population loyal and keep folks like me, who want really good food (part-way there) in an amazing environment with friendly service (check), coming back.",

We ordered the clam appetizer, and we are the types who don't like a lot of added extras like sauce, seasonings, or cheese.  The clams were brought out smothered with cheese and tomatoes - yuck!  Neither the server or the menu said anything about this.  After sending it back twice we finally decided on mussels which were better.  The steak was so-so for the price we paid, had a lot of gristle. The chocolate cake dessert was the best part of the whole meal.  We left there feeling like we paid a lot of money for mediocre food & service. Many other steak houses in town are less expensive with better food quality.",

The decor is classy, old and dark. Very vintage-classic steakhouse. Its refreshing to go to a restaurant and totally feel like your in another time. All the staff was nice, knowledgeable and attentive. The food is to die for.   Seeing as I only went there for lunch, I had a sandwich and sweet potato fries (which were the best I have ever had). Hopefully one day I can go back and try what they're famous for, steak!   I would 100% recommend this place for anything from an intimate date to a place to impress your boss.",

    "text": "It takes guts to be a steakhouse with a pink exterior, red velvet brocade wallpaper and an entrance through the kitchen. I give them five stars just for having the balls to pull that off -- and for being able to pull it off for nearly 60 years.   Yes, this place is a Phoenix landmark. Anything over 20 years is considered a landmark here, so this place is actually ancient by Phoenix standards. Although I've lived in Phoenix my entire 31 (almost 32) years, I never had the pleasure to dine at Durant's until about a year ago.  I came for a work dinner and was pleased to have had a great first experience.  My second experience at Durant's was for lunch. And this time, the experience was better than great, it was fantastic! I had the French Dip, which is one of my favorite sandwiches. I've tired them at many different places, and have found a few that were pretty decent.  But that was until I tried Durant's French Dip. Holy Cow!  The meat was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  And there was plenty of it!  I seriously don't know how I managed to eat what I did.  It didn't look like that much, but man oh man, it was piled on there. And to add to the deliciousness of the French Dip, I got sweet potato fries.  Yowzer!  What a decadent meal. I needed a serious siesta afterward.  Both visits to Durant's were True culinary and mouthwatering pleasures. It is a little pricey for an all-the-time spot, but for a special occasion, it is definitely the place to go. Plus, it has got history and panache. And who the hell doesn't like both those things in a restaurant?!",

It was a birthday celebration and although we were a bit shocked at the sticker price that was not an issue. However, we sat for 10-12 minutes and the only acknowledgement we received was water delivered to the table. We saw a server tending to a large group but nothing to indicate he was our server. We expected a little better service and left. I would have said something to the host (who by the way was very nice and addressed me by name) but he was not at the stand.

I'm not sure if it was because we were younger than the average crowd, Hispanic, or because they were homophobic. One waiter (Cory) asked us not to use our phone in the restaurant, but yet everyone else around us was using their phones. Did I mention he wasn't even our waiter? I have never felt this disrespected. This restaurant isn't cheap and we paid about $60-70 per person (the same as everyone else). It's not like we had a groupon or some type of freebie . The manager offered us a discount on our bill, but that wasn't enough to erase the embarrassment that we had just felt. The food isn't even that great people! We ate about a tenth of our food and basically told them to keep their leftovers!   Too bad we can't rate zero stars because that's what I would do!",

Haven't been here for awhile but decided to take my mom out for her birthday and go back to what we thought was still a really high end spot, considering it stills says ($$$) and dress code says dressy and there were more good/okay vs. bad recent reviews.  Dress code was not dressy! We saw people VERY CASUAL, saw people with basketball shorts, flip flops, t-shirts, jeans, ball caps. Which is fine, but not what we remembered for a high end restaurant.  Food was good, not excellent. Overall we didn't feel it was worth the high end price. We got a spinach and artichoke app which was enough for 4. Prime rib, the bone-in rib eye, top sirloin, and clam linguini w/ white sauce and a free desert for my mom's birthday which were all good! Total came out to $307 after tip.  Overall experience was okay but the price does not match/make sense for what the dress code is, the quality of food and overall experience.",

This place is classic old school ice in the urinals, black vest, tux shirt, and tie type of place. You expect Frank Sinatra and The Don to be sitting in one of the round oxblood red booths. I'm almost looking for the old bullet holes in the red textured velour wallpaper. Best seafood and steaks you'll ever get in this town. The service is always impeccable. If you want a cool experience park in back and go through the back door. You go right through the kitchen and the back of the house welcomes you. They got nothing to hide here and they know it. I promise you won't be disappointed. When I stay in Phoenix my main criteria for a hotel is how close it is to Durant's",

I had to flag someone down each time when I needed something like water or the check after sitting there forever. Good thing I didn't want a dessert, that would've never happened.  It's one of those waitresses that have probably worked there forever and thinks she owns the place - but doesn't. I was surprised to see how packed this place was at lunch on a weekday, and my girlfriend and I kept commenting on how long it was taking tables around us to get their food.  Ours came at a reasonable time but seriously every other table was waiting FOREVER. I know it's a nicer restaurant but it's still lunch and the patrons were visibly on a lunch break. It's still a 4 Star review because my Salmon with Mango glaze with mashed potatoes and veggies were very good. The Cesar salad was not good.  I also like the ambiance in there and the restaurant used to be an old mob hangout. I mean come on, that's pretty cool.  I'd go back for dinner but would request a different waitress if I got stuck with the same one again.",

I have been there a few times over the years and it's remained the same. The deep velvety red wallpaper and perfectly dimmed lighting make it a wonderful place to enjoy an unbelievably good meal. I got the chicken and was shocked at how good it was. Sacrilege I know. I couldn't make myself  forgo the sticker shock of what I would have chosen (I'm sure similar restaurants charge the same). Yikes, that's sad. Loved the amazing waitstaff who are unobtrusive. And, the waiter didn't make me uncomfortable by having me test the wine first (very intuitive). The owner/manager was the one who asked how everything was. They are old school in that they leave everyone's plate on the table until the last person is finished. You are free to take your time without feeling rushed. We did laugh when our waiter asked if we were done with our dessert. Um. The only way we wouldn't have been done was to lick the raspberry off the plate and none of us are five ;). But, that was his way of letting us know we should take our time.   Our son got there before us and said he had a hard time finding the front door. I didn't know there was one. Do not use it. Going through the kitchen sets the stage. Everyone greets you almost like you're a regular. You can't help but think of all the business and government deals have been made. Plus, surely the mom ate there back in the day.  I almost don't want to say this so please don't only read this part, but for the love of God, get rid of the tv!! It's not a sports bar and if you can't go without tv for a few hours, go elsewhere. Unfortunately, the tv was a distraction and I did have to focus on the table. Had my ADHD husband been facing the tv, no amount of medication could have kept his eyes from the shiny thing on the wall. He doesn't even watch sports.   Anyway, it's a must. Maybe the other side doesn't have a tv. I'd certainly ask. Go!",

That was $20 for a hamburger patty and veggies.  How in the world do you make ground beef so tough you can't chew or cut it??  Service was very slow too.

    "text": "Another solid & delicious dinner!  My mom and I are back- we were seeing a show in Tempe so we came in for an early lunch.  Tempe is seriously lacking in decent steakhouses so lucky for Durants.  We came in around 4:10 pm and requested a bar table- unfortunately they were reserved.  We sat in a dining room booth, boring atmosphere at that time of day.  Would seem a tiny bit crowded if it were full.  I was in the mood for a margarita, as usual, and my mom got wine.  It wasn't the best I've had but obviously from fresh lime.  Nice to see our server bring the wine bottle out & pour a sip before committing to the wine.   The crudites and bread are solid starters and we were bad and got 1/2 order of onion rings to start. They were nice and hot and crispy- everything we were hoping for!  For salads my mom had the house and I had the wedge which was delicious!  They are generous with toppings and the lettuce is nice and cold.  For entrees we tried a 16 oz T-bone.   It wasordered it medium well though it arrived more medium than she prefers.  Our server came back to check at the perfect time and quickly replaced the steak with a perfect medium well T-bone with new potato.  So many restaurants would bring the same potato or left the potato when they took the steak.  Small things make a difference!  My Kobe sliders were yummy on pretzel buns with Caramelized onions and a horseradish mustard.  If I get them again I would get the mustard on the side.  It was still really yummy but very mustardy.  I had a recommended Cabernet Sauvignon that went great with this & ended up being on the happy hour.  Thank you to our server again for not trying to bring a $16 glass of wine when a comparable one is on happy hour!   We were way too full for dessert but reminisced about the delicious creamy New York cheesecake.  I get the impression this place really understands customer loyalty and what customers value.  Thank you Durants for another delicious, comfortable, and fun meal for my mom and me!",

Appetizers were solid: Raw oysters on the half shell, crudites, crabcake, spinach-artichoke dip.  Service was OK.  It was Saturday night and they were out of the pork chop. Unacceptable. Then the ribeye I received was incredibly tough. Very disappointing.  I'd give this place another shot if someone else wanted to take me, but I wouldn't go on my own.",

Let's start with entering through the kitchen, YES I know everyone talks about it but, I love that the staff greets you like you are a regular even if you are not. Next the red velvet walls, the booths, the low lighting, the old school photos, and an actual phone booth, all fling you back to the 50's when the place opened and when people dressed up for dinner.  Oh and the bar! That full length bar with rounded ends and the huge padded arm rest that always makes me think that after my meal I could take a quick nap before dessert.  The bar is actually where I prefer to eat dinner.  Don't roll your eyes until you try it.  On to the food.  I am not one to tell someone what steak they should choose, so let's just say they are all great.  What I am good at is telling people is what the must have items are on the menu.  On the top of my list are the onion rings.  These are the best onion rings on the planet and yes I have gone there just for those and drinks.  The stone crab is a must (if it is even available on the night you go) Oh and of course save room for the strawberry shortcake I mean it!  One last thought.  If you appreciate a great cocktail, and I mean cocktail (Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Martini etc.) that is made correctly with the right amount of each ingredient and has the correct garnish this is your place for happy hour!",

    "text": "Durant's, I wanted to like you. I really did. I'm a huge fan of steakhouses, particularly ones with as much character as you clearly do. But what you did to my $51 bone-in ribeye was too unspeakable to allow me to recommend this place to anyone. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  I was able to get past the fact that the server looked like a mix between an airport bartender and a blackjack dealer at a casino on an indian reservation. In fact, I kind of appreciated it as sort of a promising omen of the character and history I expected from the esteemed Durant's Steakhouse of Phoenix. Surely this veteran of the steakhouse circuit would have her routine polished and provide a truly memorable experience.  Sadly, I was mistaken. She could barely answer simple questions about the cuts of meat coherently. She was slow and inattentive, and got our appetizer orders wrong.  OK, I can get past that. Just having a bad day right? Well here comes my delicious bone in ribeye, mesquite grilled to precisely the \"just barely medium rare\" specifications I had so politely and clearly requested.  Wrong again. Perhaps near the bone was an area of steak that one could charitably label \"medium rare.\" most of it was much closer to medium and the periphery approached carbonization. In fact, I could not finish it (a first for me). Sadly, by the time our server reappeared to ask how everything was, I was no longer hungry. Of  course, she expressed remorse and offered to make it right (bringing the table a complementary order of passable strawberry shortcake), but it was going to take more than strawberry preserves, poundcake and whipped cream to get the taste of charcoal out of my mouth.  If you want excellent steak, as much as it pains me to say it, stick with Ruths Chris or Mastro's. If you want Old Phoenix flavor and are OK with rolling the dice with your meat preparation, give Durant's a shot.",

Also, this place is a little weird - very old-skool, in a weird part of Phoenix (the building from the outside is a trip - looks like a cross between a bowling alley and a strip club), and the service just felt a little bit awkward to me.  Maybe I am just so used to places with a more casual, modern vibe.  We had a good meal here, but I don't know if I'd come back or not.  I know it's a chain, but Ruth's Chris is more my kind of place, and I think the steak is better....plus i like the Biltmore area much better than this area (I don't even know what this 'hood is called - central phoenix?)",

    "text": "I met my husband at Durant's after work recently.  The bar was filled with downtown Phoenix professionals enjoying cocktails after work.  The only problem is that it was just before the smoking ban hit, so people were furiously puffing away while they could.  Durant's is a very nice expense account type place, so it was nice to see that you could also eat dinner at the bar, which several people were doing.  I was dressed casually so I felt a little out of place.  But it was totally self induced.  We didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat us in a cozy booth fairly quickly.    We started with Durant's Debris (my husband raved about it so I had to try it; it's bits of steak) and a Shrimp cocktail.  The seafood here is amazing, so don't feel you MUST order a steak.    For dinner I had the shrimp and crab louis salad.  Delicious and VERY generous portion.  We didn't make it to dessert because we were stuffed from dinner.  You might skip the appetizer if you want to have any hope...or share one.    One other funny thing.  If you use the valet parking, you enter the restaurant through the kitchen, a la Goodfellas.  There's a refrigerator on your left as you enter where they have one of their famous massive Porter House steaks.  It's huge, like 50 ounces.  It's the ultimate place to indulge.",

    "text": "Being in Durant's reminds me of being a bit actor in a movie remake of some 1950s cult classic.  Like oceans 11.  The original had Sinatra and Martin and Davis, Jr and Bishop.    The remake had Clooney and Pitt and Damon and Garcia.  And although the 2001 version was pretty good, maybe even VERY good, something about it seems disingenuous.    But when we talk about the cool-factor of the 1960s \"11\", there is no denying that the film makes you feel like you're walking around like your number one.  Well, translate that into this dusty steak joint, that has somehow passed its prime and now seems like a poor remake of its former (classic) self.  Their food has sadly nose-dived into average, while their prices have sharply risen like a Vegas hotel room on a holiday weekend.  I only feel marginally dapper drinking in here.  Sure the bartenders are cool and quite aware, but the setting is dank and I feel like I'm drinking in an 80s mob bar that is trying to thematically play homage to a 20s speakeasy.    Where once THIS was the steakhouse that others (even chains -- heya Bucco di Beppo) tried to emulate, everything just seems to have spindled out of order.  Its trying hard to work, but it just doesn't.  I'm also aware that they are under new mgmt and have changed some staples on the menu.  We shall see if they will return.  For now, I'm just going to stick to drinking the occasional scotch at the bar before moving on to Capital Grille or City Hall.",

We had to send back both entree's Steak prepared Rare instead of Medium Rare, and Halibut served raw in the middle. To compensate the did give me a comp glass of wine, and my husband a dessert, however he didn't get to choose the dessert, which was quite disappointing, since I had my heart sent on sharing the trio of creme brulee and we got cheesecake which I didn't care for.

The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance. Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well.  5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices.  However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer. It does ignite the \"romantic mood\" and will leave you reflecting on those \"good old days\".",

I miss the great times dining here with my grandfather when he was still around.  He could always point out the notable lawyers and politicos at dinner time, and I could tell that he enjoyed carrying on his tradition as much as I enjoyed playing a part in it.  What also used to be.... truly exceptional service!  It's still great, but I have the fondest memories of the last generation of wait staff.  They always recognized the regulars even if we hadn't been there for several months.  Likewise, they would often remember our regular orders.  This place practically defined classy dining for me as I was growing up, which is why I've always gone there for birthdays.  In more recent years, I admit I've been less loyal, although it appears that others are keeping them busy enough in the mean time.  But I recently learned a new way to enjoy Durant's on a budget.  A few weeks ago, I took some clients there for lunch and had yet another great experience.  The menu revolves around burgers at lunch time, which I wouldn't dream of ordering for dinner, but they are indeed tasty.  I think I will be back soon for another lunch, if not dinner and cocktails as well.",

They are awesome, in this cream sauce that is indescribable. I always get the filet (medium rare) with the garlic mashed potatoes.  LOVE IT!! really good place for a date, a small party, or just a fanciful dinner. Did i say that i LOVE IT??? It is kind of expensive, but completely worth the price. You are guaranteed to leave satisfied.",

Had a drink at the bar while we waited a few minutes for a table. No, make that had a perfect, delicious, wish-I-could-replicate-that-at-home martini! We were seated by a gracious hostess, unfortunately it was a teeny tiny booth and the bf is super-tall so he was a little squished. Our server was all around wonderful, the Oysters Rockefeller amazing, and our steaks cooked to perfection. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the sommelier. Our server sent him over to assist us, and his disheveled appearance kind of turned me off right away. However, it was his total lack of enthusiasm that really got to me. He didn't seem interested in helping us at all, he barely spoke two sentences to us. Our server seemed more knowledgeable and was much more helpful, thank goodness! Overall, a wonderful dinner and will return for future special occasions.",

Be on your A-game because Durants is all A game.  First, coming through the kitchen never gets old, no getting around it, you feel like you're part of a very cool club and the vibe just continues as you approach the hostess. Every time, she always acts like she had been waiting for me and my party all night. Then there is the decor.  It's better in person just go see it. Finally, the best thing about Durants is the food. The sides of spinach, potatoes are incredible but the steaks are what makes Durants so amazing. Truly incredible. Channel your inner Marilyn, grab your best man an have a meal that sends you to the moon.",

I was in Phoenix for business and went to Durant's looking for a good steak and a restaurant with character.  I was not disappointed.    The 50s are alive in the restaurant with the red upholstered booths and the red velvet looking walls.  Portraits and paintings line the booths.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the wine list if top notch.  You can't get a better filet.  5 stars",

    "text": "I'm going to qualify this review by saying that Durant's is an experience and definitely not for everybody. If budget is at all a factor, or if you're expecting Claim Jumper sized portions (or even a fifth of a Claim Jumper portion) this place is not for you. This place is classy, old-school. When you walk through the kitchen to get to the dinning room, you are going back in time. The place oozes with history, from the red leather upolstry to the lamps and carpet. Anyone who's read up on this place knows the history and famous actors who once graced Durant's with their presence. The servers are veterans, again old-school many East Coast. The menu has a lot of awesome selections but this is where the budget comes in as this is one of the highest priced menus I've seen in Phoenix. We're talking $125 MINIMUM per person if you're going to do dinner, apps and cocktails. Also, as I said your plate is not going to be piled with food. But I can honestly say the filet mignon I had was one of the best I've ever had:cooked perefectly and tender like nobody's business. I also have to point out that a good salad is included with your entree. Having lived in L.A. and gone to supper clubs like the Dal Rae, I have seen similar entrees priced lower. But as many such places ar ala carte, things balance out at Durant's since you're not paying extra for a salad. That is one thing the struck me straight off. So yes, you're going to pay a lot and you won't have to undo a notch in your belt when you leave. But in my opinion, the quality of food and the overall experience is worth the cost, especially if you want a really memorable place to go for a special occasion.",

From the entrance along the red carpet in the kitchen, to the velvet covered walls, high back red booths, and staff in tuxedos, you know you are in for a treat as soon as you walk in. Hell, even the line cooks will wave hi and bye to you.   Featured in the bar every afternoon is a killer happy hour, with half price domestic and well drinks. They typically draw a pretty good crowd that doesn't seem to let up until late in the evening. A lot of the clientele here is the well heeled group from Phoenix Country Club, Palmcroft, and other nicer neighborhoods. It's a diverse group from 20 somethings to the about to die blue hairs.   The honest truth, as others have said, is that you can find a better steak. I would barely put Durant's in the top 10 with stars like Donovan's, Mastro's, BLT, J&G, etc. But Durant's isn't all about the steak, it's about the experience, one every phoenician should encounter at least once in their lifetime. The owners aren't the least bit accommodating either, as they don't have to be. The restaurant fills up almost every night.   I still maintain that if it weren't for Durant's, a lot of people wouldn't even know what Central Avenue in Midtown looks like. I hear very often, oh, downtown, thats by Durant's right? Long live a Phoenix landmark.",

It's our special occasion place because it is expensive. Walking through the kitchen is a nice experience and the staff always greets us. They actually didn't have our reservation the last time we went for our anniversary but they sat us right away. A nice booth opened up after we were seated and they moved us. The service is impeccable and very detailed. I love the relish tray in the beginning. It's so old school. My husband says it's the best Old Fashioned in the Valley. The salad dressings are made in house. I don't really eat bleu cheese dressing but I always order it at Durants. The bread: how long can I go on about this bread? There's nothing like it! A nice, round bread mound drenched in melted butter, topped with a spinach artichoke schmootz served in a bowl? Unreal. I ordered the ribeye this last time instead of filet. So flavorful and juicy, perfectly cooked. I like to get the baked potato with my entree...served w/ butter, sour cream, and chives of course. Something about meat and a baked potato makes me think of my Dad who's passed and he always ordered baked with all the fixings. By this time we are wondering how we'll fit dessert in but we can't skip it! The creme brulee trio is the best and perfect for two to share. We always do cappuccinos and if we're taking a cab, Sambuca. And then we say night night. Always a top notch experience!",

I saw people in shorts and T-shirts walking in, and upon entering, thought there was clearly a disconnect and lack of keeping up standards.  All I can say is that I was WRONG!!!  I'm in town for a Father's Day weekend from NYC, and used to the great steakhouses in the country there.  The food here was comparable and in some cases, better.  My steak was amazing as well as being cooked perfectly, baked potato amazing, the bread drenched in butter and garlic, amazing, the salad, yup, amazing.   I will say the food is priced high, even more than NYC, which is fine, and it is worth it, but the wine list is so accessible to any budget, it isn't even funny.  Be sure to  take advantage of it. Some bottles less than $30. The waiter, bartenders and maitre D was great as well.  Wow, what a meal.  I'm full, I'm drunk, and I'm happy.  I highly recommend.",

    "text": "It doesn't get any better than this fellow steak lovers!  DURANT'S continues their tradition of PERFECTION. We arrived at 6:15pm  - 15 minutes earlier than our 6:30pm reservation. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. I love the cool vibe which totally takes you back to some of the classic New York City steak houses.   Here's what we ordered: 8oz. Filet cooked to perfection \"black & blue\" which is the only way to enjoy a juicy steak. Prime rib, and 2 orders of the 14 oz. NY strip. We ate every delicious morsel. I don't want to forget the outstanding Italian wedding soup, which was a heavenly marriage of meatballs and spinach in a flavorful broth. I sopped up every single drop of the broth with the crusty hot bread they brought to the table.  For dessert we all shared an apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream.   Everything from start to finish was pure perfection. Our expert server, David Hooley, deserves a shout out for everything he did to make our evening special in every way. I can't say enough about this place. Sure it's expensive. But as the saying goes: quality remains long after price is forgotten. I'd eat here every week if they were in my neck of the woods, but it's a two hour round trip adventure so we'll just keep it as our occasional treat when we're craving the BEST BEEF IN ARIZONA!",

Service is hit or miss and the quality of food you can tell has gone down as prices have gone up - seems like the economy has been hitting them harder than expected.  One bit of advice is to eat in the dining area, not the bar area.  You will get better service for sure.",

    "text": "This review is over twenty years overdue.  Durant's has changed over the years. The stern no nonsense maitre d that directed if and where you sat and whom would serve you has been replaced with a much softer version of himself.  Shirts and ties, or at least an evening jacket has become the exception rather than the norm for the male dining clientele.  The ladies still look nice, but don't tend to dress up as much as down to dine.  The fresh cut roses (enormous and fragrant) have have given way to much more modest floral decoration and (shudder) Mylar balloons.   Durant's is where those on the outside went to watch the power brokers of Phoenix have lunch and dinner.  Mayors, governors, sports celebrities and members of the powerful Phoenix Forty were a common sight.  Years prior the likes of Clark Gable, Jane Russell, Lee Marvin and John Wayne could be spotted as well.  (Guys, imagine John Wayne standing at that same ice filled urinal).  Not so much now.   What is the same?  First, the food.  I sincerely believe the food is the same first rate food and beverage that can/could be acquired and is as expertly prepared as was available in 1950.   Service is next.  The wait staff is first rate being personable, attentive and completely knowledgeable about the menu and drink options.  A high server to table ratio ensures your drinks are continuously topped up, empty plates are promptly removed and your dining experience is always a positive one.  Next the place itself.  You enter through the kitchen.  Think about that.  Any other restaurant of lower quality would might be afraid of what you might see.  Not here.  The food prep areas are spotless and orderly, the cooks and assistants are dressed neatly and are friendly.  When in there, note the mesquite wood fired ovens that make those steaks and chops taste so good.  (Sometimes newbie customers will wander around and come in through the front entrance, perhaps as their rite of initiation, but only once.)  \"Friends don't let friends use the front door\"  The red velvet patterned wallpaper, the large red vinyl private booths, the small toilets, the 1950's era phone booth where errant cell phone users are directed to take their apparently important calls are the same and hopefully never will change.  Don't go there for a cheap meal.  (The reviews by those complaining about the cost are borderline hilarious).  Do go for special occasions, but no, the waiters will not gather around to clap and sing happy birthday to you for the annoyance of the surrounding guests.  The Mrs. and I go two to three times a year, and it's at this humble establishment  where we first met for lunch and now enjoy our anniversary dinner each and every year on the 14th of February.     Our favorites?  The Mrs. prefers the Prime Rib with the knock you back in your seat freshly ground side of horseradish sauce. (Use sparingly  - you have been warned).  Mine is the Top Sirloin medium to medium well, and I steal a little of her horseradish sauce for effect.  You almost don't need a knife to cut the steak or Prime Rib, they are of the highest quality.  Do not insult the place by asking for steak sauce, it is not needed.  At least once have the shrimp cocktail..Words cannot describe it.  We have been married over eighteen years, I do not share it with her, it is that good.   And, please dress up a little bit, show some class and respect.  There are many other places in town where shorts, sandals and ball caps are adequate dining apparel.",

Don't order anything other then the steak you want. My spouse had Scallops added. Not a real good idea here. They were the smallest Scallops I've ever seen.....ever. The price difference was huge for what you got. They were not cooked all that well and were a bit gummy. You only received three (3) and they were no bigger then a nickel and not all that thick ether. Way too much money for that. My suggestion is, stick to steaks without the seafood add-on. They have no idea what they're doing. Go to a seafood restaurant for seafood not Durant's.",

It all started with the entrance through the kitchen (Goodfellas style)!This was one of his favorite parts as he loves the movie.   Then, we were greater by a friendly hosts who escorted us to our table. Our server showed up shortly after and the party has started.   For start, they bring you this amazing bread roll, soaked in olive oil and topped with mixture of leaks and few other greens. Then complimentary plate of raw vegetables served on bed of ice. Amazing!  We started of with some cocktails and deep fried chicken liver for appetizer, which was delicious. For the main course, we both ordered 8 oz. Filet Mignon that was served with super fluffy and delicious mashed potatoes. Easy 10 stars for the main course. The Filet was cooked to perfection and was melting in my mouth like butter.   The dessert was complementary on the house for a birthday boy! We choose to share Creme Brulee Trio for which, I easily give 5 stars.   The atmosphere was super nice. It made us feel like we were somewhere in New York. The story about the restaurant was super cool and our server was kind enough to share it.   Expect great food, atmosphere, service but also expect to pay $$$$ for it. For special occasions, absolutely worth every pennie!",

I felt like it was interesting and nostalgic, but it seems like they've let the place go...   We started with cocktails; of course, you can't go wrong there and they're heavy on the pours! Next we got some salads, eh, nothing spectacular, but oh well, I wasn't there for a salad. We ordered filets for our entrees and the steak was amazing, so full of flavor! The sides were not as good though, they border pathetic. We got the broccolini which was lifeless and bland. We also had the crab Mac and cheese, it was low on crab and needed salt.   I wish they would do a little updating on the way they prepare the sides, as well as fix up/clean up the restaurant a little, because the steak was really good.",

    "text": "Dissapointing. After my first experience of getting food poisoning,  I tried to give Durrants a second chance but was disappointed again. On our second visit we went for my husband's birthday because he wanted a good steak dinner. Our waiter was very nice and accomidating. Durrants has a very cool old town gangter restaurant feeling, including the entering through the kitchen. The atmosphere is loud but adds to the experience. We were seated in a hallway close to the bar, but we did not mind until a large group of men started to crowd into the bar area in front of our table blocking the hallway and facing their butts toward a our table. They were so close to our table that when someone tried to go by our table they would slide their butt across our table to get through. It was very disturbing while we were trying to enjoy our main course with a view of large Butts. We told our waiter and he apologized, offered to move us, and had someone ask the butts to move. The butts move for a second then were back in full view. The food was underwhelming; my husband's filet was warm and dry. Again, the waiter was very nice and knew these butts were annoying and offered a free dessert. Very nice but, our meal was already spoiled. On our way out we noticed the other part of the bar area was not crowded. Why the butts decided to hang out in the crowded area against our table was a mystery.  I felt bad that my husband did not get an enjoyable birthday dinner. I understand the butts were customers too, but I think management could have addressed the issue better since we were not the only table that had issues with this group and there was plenty of room on the other side of the bar. Needless to say, that was the last time we will ever go to Durrants.",

We were greeted pretty quickly and waited about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.   I had the bone in Ribeye and my date had the Filet and grilled Scallops. My Ribeye was ordered rare and came out easily medium and that's me being pretty generous. The filet was ordered medium rare and came out correctly but the scallops were exceptionally uneven. A couple were burnt, some were almost raw. I'm not sure what was going on. After being sent back everything came out as close to correct as you can hope for. The scallops were still a disaster but my date had given up on them and just enjoyed her filet. She told me to not make a big deal out of it.    I will say this, through all of this, our server kept her composure, apologized a billion times and tried to make sure everything was good. She seemed to be slightly overwhelmed because another one of her tables was having issues but she kept it together. I was just frustrated at the end but she did everything she could to make it right. Maybe the kitchen was just having an off night.   Going out to places like this is kind of a treat for me so when it doesn't go well it's kind of a bummer.

    "text": "Durant makes you feel like your in the movie GoodFellas!   You drive around back and you walk right through the kitchen......  The hustle and bustle of the kitchen had me on pins and needles.  What an awesome experience. We  were seated on all red leather seats with red walls. This place is so cool...   Let's get to the food..... This place isn't CHEAP..... You are going to pay some serious money. When a plate of shrimp scampi costs $48.00 (YES, HUNTEE, it's not a typo)  this better be the best shrimp scampi ever... and I must say it was good now was it $48.00 good... that depends on the individual..but it was good!   Now their steaks that's another thing all together. It was amazing.... but wait there shrimp cocktail gave me LIFE... It was so damn good.   The shrimps were butterfly style and the horseradish cocktail sauce was AMAZING.... sweet and spicy at the same time.  Yummy!!!   The wine list was 6 pages long.  You can get an entire bottle or a half of bottle. Of course I finished the entire bottle. Yes, ME not WE!   Who's ready for dessert.... I AM! I ordered the tiramisu, it was delicious..one of the best tiramisu I had so far!   Look this place is great for an anniversary, birthday or any celebration.    The bill turned out to be a whooping... wait..... It was over $340.00 that's not including tip.  It's an expensive place but it depends on you... to me it was worth the experience at least once!",

The reviews made me a Tad nervous but the girl I brought was already buzzing from the pool bar and I was tired so we went anyways.  Drinks were awesome and the service I got was also great. Of course the lady and myself were looking pretty good so that may of had something to do with it.  I had the rib eye and my chick had some sort of fish. Both dishes while not bad were rather uninspired. Nothing that I wanted to text back home about awesome steak or anything.  I will come back for the booze.

    "text": "My husband & I have been patrons of Durrant's for nearly 40 years.  The service has always been the best as well as the food.  However, on this trip, while our server did his best, some of the food was a disappointment this time, except for the Oysters Rockefeller.  The bread loaf was just too darn soggy from the olive oil.  Our lettuce wedges were covered with unedible black charcoaled bacon bits. We ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer & got the full dinner plate of shrimp scampi linguini.  The shrimp was way over-cooked & hard.  The linguini was dripping with oil.  What really got our goats was the fact that we ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer was less than $20, but the same shrimp w/linguini was $20 more.  So, basically, we paid $20 for a dish of linguini that I could not eat because I'm gluten sensitive.  We discussed the error with our witer & he insisted that's what we ordered.  We tried to send it back & just get the shrimp alone, but there was no doing that.  my husband chose not to make a scene & get our server in trouble for the screw up, because he was a nice man.  He treated us to a free dessert.  The other thing is that their prices have risen to the point of being ridiculously high, especially for being in a restaurant with a musty aroma from the old wall covering, booths, ceilings, & carpet.  The restrooms are the worst.  They are the tiniest, most uncomfortable public spaces we've ever been in.  One has to nearly sit on the toilet to shut the stall door.  They are not ADA accessible & the  women's smells of sewer at times.  This last visit will probably be one of our law visits.  They are so proud of their continued operation based upon an old reputation that the idea of being called \"nostalgic\" is an understatement.  The place is just really old & dirty feeling.  The high food prices do NOT reflect the quality & quantity of the food, & especially the musty outdated ambiance.",

While some diners may call a dirty and neglected restaurant as one with ambiance and atmosphere, I call it for what it is, a place that has aged without care of replacing or updating things as needed, and that goes for the food too.  It may have been quite the fancy dinner at one time, but unless your taste buds are as stuck in time as this place, nothing exciting or even worth remembering here - very bland.  I guess as long as people keep coming and swooning over this old and gawdy place, that will continue to be used as an excuse not to care or change.  At a minimum, they really should at least sweep up the broken beer bottles and all the cigarette butts up in their parking lot and sidewalk.",

    "text": "Honestly, they deserve 10 stars. Durant's on historic Central Ave is one of two favorite Phoenix restaurants, and I've been a long-time patron. First, the fare. Perfect. Every time. Prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes is a \"sure thing\" although the filet is equally delectable. Flavor, temperature, presentation, timing, all perfectly orchestrated. Great wine and mixed drink selection, strawberry shortcake (their signature dessert) is out of this world. Second, the ambience. You walk in the back door through the kitchen like you're a Don in Goodfellas. Everyone greets you as though you're a member of the family. The dimly lit dining room is encapsulated in rich, red velvet wall paper with matching red seating. It's also a well tended historic property, adding to its quaint charm. Third, the staff. Always affable, accommodating, and genuinely kind. I cannot recommend it enough. Bon appetit!",

    "text": "I'm not sure if Durant's is really 5-star worthy, but something about it, I gotta say I like...a lot.  I also don't know what mind boggling insightful information I can provide after 90 plus reviews, but I'll put in my 2 cents (dammit, here we go again with the lack of a cents key on my keyboard--typewriters have them you know!) which will buy you nothing BTW.  Yes, there's red velvet wallpaper and one could argue the interior is more like a \"before\" shot, but that's part of its charm (\"charm\"...one of those words you don't like to read in a real estate listing, much like \"cozy\" or \"up & coming neighborhood.\")  But I think anyone over the age of 40...I'm not saying I am over 40 mind you...will appreciate the comfortable, recognizable, glimpse into the past it offers you.  I would have never seen the inside of a place like Durant's as a kid since I would have either been left at home or sent to the car (my parents had no problems with sticking you in the car even when it was 110 outside), but I can imagine this is what I missed.  Service did start a little rocky.  Rocky as in at least 10-15 minutes for someone to even consider taking a drink order.  But when I ordered a sloe gin fizz, I did not get a blank stare, however, I'm pretty sure I did not get sloe gin either.  There was a little overkill on the sweet, so hard to tell.    Once we were able to order a drink, service was impeccable...see what a drink in hand can do for you?  We had oysters rockefeller which were seriously delicious, and I had the scallop and filet combination.  Scallops were perfectly seared and the filet was almost fork tender.  Garlic mashed potatoes were not hot enough, nor garlicky enough either.  But I forgot all about that when I saw the size of the strawberry shortcake.  When you're sharing, size does matter.  So I love Durant's in spite of a few shortcomings, and I would happily return.  Maybe in a few years, when my dad is really old, I can send his ass to the car.",

Thanks to Yelp, Durant's came up.  After confirming with the concierge at the resort, we realized the place is pretty legit.  So we are in the car, driving up, and we pull up at the stoplight across the street.  Looking across, the place looked like a strip club.  Pink building with no windows.....seriously, do we abort?  Ahhh heck, let's do this.\"  So the 10 of us go in.  When you walk in, you enter through the kitchen.  The wall paper is red and looks like it has texture to it.  \"ok, are we making the right choice? Yes, we are here let's do it\"  I ordered the Bone in Ribeye and let me tell you, it was to die for.  Even better than that was the scallops and loaded baked potato.   Dessert came, and oh snap daddy likes. Creme brulee in three styles: coconut rum, chocolate and berry.  Would I recommend it again?...heck yes!  Rock on Durant's",

Dimly lit with a somewhat mafia like gangstery feeling warm atmosphere, professional and prompt no b.s. service with THE BEST tasting 12 oz filet I have ever had. The walk through the kitchen is a nice touch, especially when leaving because you get a chance to thank the chefs that made that mouthwatering slab of perfection you just gorged on. I don't mind paying a bit more for a meal like I had last night. And they don't skimp on the pours, my martini was filled to the brim which is just how it should be. Mastros can take their pretentious wait staff and long speeches about how their cows are hand fed grass by some old farmer and his wife in ohio and seasoned with blah blah blah, seared in a 1200 degree oven and served with bleh blipitty bloop and if I order it rare it will have a cool pink center etc (I think I know what rare is)... just give me the GD steak and make it amazing like Durant's did and let me enjoy my company and my meal. I can't wait to go back!  P.S. Their Bearnaise sauce was great too.",

Earlier this week, my wife and I wanted to go someplace special for an early anniversary dinner. While we were thinking of restaurants to visit, she tossed out Durant's and the suggestion elicited a pretty instant \"YES!\" from me.  Durant's as you know, is classic old school Phoenix. Everyone from political big wigs to mobsters making time in the valley between New York, Jersey, California, Vegas, and prison made the Central Phoenix steakhouse the place to be. They still serve one of the best martinis that you'll find around. That and some quality time in their lounge should appeal to most people, at least as a one time thing.  In any case, my wife and I managed to slip in without a reservation; it was a Monday night so we weren't that worried. We both ordered the the 12 ounce top sirloin steak, which was perfection as expected.  Our server, Kevin, was the best. His easygoing friendliness was pretty great and he made us feel like rock stars. While Durant's has great desserts, Kevin was the cherry on top.",

Simply put - Durant's has the best ambience of any steakhouse in the Valley, from its deep booths (perfect for date nights) and red velvet wallpaper to its kitchen entrance and Rat Pack swagger. It also has the best food on a consistent basis: I've never gone wrong with a classic martini, medium-rare prime rib, and any chilled seafood choice.   Reservations are recommended, as is eating at off-peak hours or on Sunday nights, as the bar and restaurant can get crowded / loud. But no matter when you visit, you'll see people of all ages in all levels of dressy/strange/casual/business attire - and you'll enjoy your experience.

Like a place Goodfellas met for business ;-)  It really is not fancy by any stretch.  It's exterior is profoundly modest and, like I say, the decor is like what we remember as \"fine\" restaurants in our youth (I'm in my 60s).  The food was very good, and the service was truly outstanding.  But, oh!, those prices!  Most steaks were in the upper $50/$60 range, and some considerably more.  Ok, you get soup or salad, which were great, but still.  It reminds me of a cool old place in LA's Koreatown, Taylor's Steakhouse, but Taylor's prices are a fraction of this place.  I enjoyed it; it was like stepping back in time, but I really cannot see how they justify their prices.  That said, it's popular, so there you go.",

    "text": "We had a great meal at Durant's on Sun 5/17 and will come back when we are in Phoenix.  We enjoyed the steak and filet and good starters and dessert. The wine list was fine and the server was excellent. We called ahead, Steve told us to come on down and expect a brief wait.  The wait was really short and staff could not have been nicer to first time out of towners.  We were staying in a hotel nearby and when driving by noticed the sign. It looked like a long-established joint, and a quick check on Yelp revealed that this is the Phoenix version of the old-fashioned steak houses we love in the LA area - SoCal types who like Dal Rae, old timers who remember the Riviera and those who know and love Park Ave will be comfortable here, down to the crudite plate.  Note that some Yelp reviews of this place that mentioned the dress were by people who may not know what's expected anywhere.  We are here to correct that.  Based on Yelp reviews we read that evening, the place is dressy, so we hurriedly DRESSED for dinner.  And sure enough, the ambiance calls for people to dress a bit better than T-shirts and jeans. And yet, there were tables of lender/developer/broker-looking types in hawaiian shirts and tommy bahama wear. California no-rules apply in PHX, evidently.  Still, even if the clientele run the gamut the same way they do in SoCal, you won't go wrong respecting management by  dressing appropriately for a nice, clubby restaurant experience.",

One would wonder why they have not changed this; however, the entry only adds to Durant's charm.  Started off my meal with a martini.  Yeah, this is a martini kinda place.  I expected the perfect martini from a place like this.  Sadly it could have been a tad colder and been prepared with a drop less vermooth.    Had their navy bean soup.  It was a really good bowl of soup perfectly seasoned with nice pieces of ham.  Hit the spot.  Will definitely opt for the soup again.  I chose an entree salad for my main course.  Was 84 degrees in Phoenix last night and a salad sounded perfect.  The salad I selected had Dungeness crab and grilled shrimp with a remoulade dressing.  It was $32.95; however, tasted great.  The fish was fresh and all of the ingredients complemented one another.    Finished off my meal with their scrumptuous key lime pie.  The graham cracker crust was thick and buttery while the pie had a nice cream consistancy.  This is another item I will definitely order again.  My party of four split a bottle of red wine.  The wine was good but served too cold.  Either their wine storage unit is set unusually low because this is Phoenix or they had it in the fridge.  Regardless it was too cold and one does not have to be a wine expert to make that revelation.  The service was fair.  They were not that busy as it was a Monday night; however, could have used one more waiter on staff.  One expects flawless service in a place like Durant's.  Will I come here again?  Of course.  Probably will order the same things I had last night.  Food was great, service was far and the ambiance very special.",

    "text": "I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.    Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today.   So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service.   Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.  Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience.   Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato.   Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested.   A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.",

    "text": "Let's start by the fact that this fine dining establishment has been in existence way since 1950. I planned this restaurant trip in accordance to my visiting sister in law. I wanted to show her what Phoenix has to offer. This was the very place to do so. The history Durant's has to offer is priceless. I believe that is much of it's appeal to me. Another factor in visiting was that is was during Phoenix Restaurant Week.  As you arrive you enter through the back entrance and through the kitchen which is an experience on its own. This is straight up mafioso style in the likes of Goodfellas. That is just the beginning of the experience. Your senses are immediately assaulted. The whiff you get from the cooks making the meal of the patrons already there is invigorating to say the least. You see first hand who is working on the meal you are about to embark on. You hear the chimes of sizzling steaks and steaming veggies. Finally you're at the hottest stand and you tell them your name. They greet you with kindness you really can't buy. They tell you they've been expecting you. You move through the crowded restaurant as it was a very busy night for them. You get to your table and the feel of the leather booths are reminiscent of restaurants Sinatra would visit.  You are seated the waiter introduces himself and you put your drink order. I got a dirty vodka martini. They are known to have exceptional cocktails. Their wine list is extensive which my sister-in law loved. You are given a plate of iced veggies with ranch which for me something I had never seen before. They were fresh and delicious. Secondly we got bread not rolls we got a whole loaf of artisan bread. It was drenched in olive oil and leek concoction. It was buttery and delicious. I could practically live in the olive oil leek mix. We ordered two appetizers the Oysters Rockefeller and fried calamari. I'll start with the Fried Calamari I'm not a big fan of the dish. The calamari you can tell was fresh. It wasn't rubbery at all and crispy in all the right places. On to the best appetizer I have ever eaten. The Oysters Rockefeller came on a steaming hot aluminum plate that held 8 Oysters covered in ooey gooey cheese and bits of crispy bacon. As soon as they hit my palate my taste buds where dancing with joy. Each bite was tender with taste of cheese, bacon and oyster. Nothing over powered the other flavors they all worked in sync. It was an amazing experience. We then ordered our meal. We both got the restaurant week special which included dessert and a glass of wine plus a pre fix entree choice of 3. We both got the 8oz prime rib medium rare. Lets just say that this prime rib does not disappoint. The cut itself a fatty cut cooked to our perfection. Every bite came with a combination of juicy red meat and buttery fat. It was seasoned to perfection. My brother and cousin both ordered the ribeye which for them was cooked to order. It was perfectly marbled. We all had sides which were all perfect in their own way. The asparagus was tender and crunchy all at once. The baked potato perfectly fluffy. The soup was also quite amazing onion cream soup. The taste of sweet onions and delicious cheese was a perfect pair. Overall, you get what you pay for. This place is not cheap. You pay for amazing food, good booze and an amazing experience. If you get the chance to go you most definitely should. This place wins over any fancy steak house in the valley.",

First we had the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely delicious. The meat of the shrimp tasted like butter, so soft, massive and delicious. I then had the 8oz filet mignon medium well and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had a Bone in rib eye and it lacked something. It also was not very tender. It lacked something and I we could not figure out what! Anyways, I really enjoyed myself. Don't come here if your looking for new and modern. It is a place that should be appreciated for what it is.",

The red velvet is great BECAUSE it reminds you of an era long passed.  It is not an inexpensive place so be prepared for that, and I highly recommend getting classed up a bit. It's nice to see people go to a fine dining icon and show some respect by wearing a dress and a suit. At least a tie.  And nostalgia beckons upon you to enter through the kitchen....just like the wiseguys of old. It's a great place, and one of a kind. I hope it stays that way forever!",

I have been coming here since I was a little girl, as it was my grandpa's FAVORITE place to celebrate his birthday. Sadly, I had not been in 19+ years!!! I told my fiance that this is where we must celebrate our anniversary dinner in honor of my grandpa.   As soon as you sit down, they bring you ice-cold veggies and their delicious ranch for dipping in addition to THEIR BREAD, holy heaven. It is drenched in butter, shallots, and just pure goodness.   Then, you must order one of their famous martinis to start. I'm a cosmo girl! For an appetizer, their JUMBO shrimp cocktail really can't be beat.   All entrees are served with a cold salad or soup. I ordered the Chicken Piccata (my first time ever not ordering a steak here!) and my fiance ordered the Trout and said it was AHHHHmazing. ;) They're really known for their amazing steaks so if you're craving red meat, this is your place. We ended the night with a Choco-tini instead of a heavy dessert because we were so full!   The service is always top notch and we can't wait to celebrate another special occasion here in the future (sooner than 19 years from now!). 5 stars all around!",

The staff was incredible and remembered me by name, the suggestions from the staff were on point as well. Not only will I be back but I want to bring as many people here who haven't been as I can.

You walk through the kitchen to get to the dining room and the host stand is there to greet you. Oh yea don't forget to make a reservation. Dim lighting and red velvet on the walls. Man did I miss this place.   We started off with fried calamari and I would have to say that it was okay. Nice and flaky but it was good. I've had better. They also brought out bread with a basil and onion on top. The bread was so good. Really good but I had to control myself for my entree.  April S was telling me to get the prime rib cause it was so good and actually the best. I was planning on ordering prime rib but our server said that ribeye and filet was the most popular and I really can't resist a good ribeye. I got the 18oz ribeye (sorry April) and it was cooked just perfectly. Nice, juicy and fresh. Boy was that good and I gobbled it all up. Topped that with a baked potato and I'm totally stuffed.   My wife ordered the Salmon with a mango ginger glaze. She really liked it a lot. I didn't get a bite cause I was so fully but everyone who tried it really enjoyed it.   My son got the 12oz filet Mignon with garlic mash. He really liked it and finished it off.   So after dinner everyone had dessert. Let's see. They had Key Lime pie, strawberry spumoni, and Cream Brule tray. They all looked really good and no one was complaining. I just got a cappuccino and that was just outstanding. Just hit the spot after such a big meal.   The service was just outstanding too. Our server was very friendly and really took care of us. Always watching over us. Our drink cups were always filled and our dirty dishes were taken away in a timely manner.   Only complaint is that the restrooms were so tiny. Trying to fit a few people in those bathrooms can be very trying. Just interesting.   So overall we had a really great time. Great food. Excellent service and a nice ambiance. So what else could you ask for. Enjoy.",

Now to our entrees - prime rib and the bone in ribeye- what can I say, Both were cooked to perfection. Had a side of garlic mashed potatoes which were excellent and also a baked potato which was perfectly cooked with awesome toppings on the side. Finished with the strawberry shortcake dessert which was huge and delectable. On a side note the wine was delicious and surprisingly economical as was the after dinner martini.",

    "text": "Disappointing experience, our waiter (Greg) was a good guy but our NOT waiter CORY singled us out... definitely discrimination.  Walked into the establishment, you walk thru the kitchen which I thought was so cool since Food Network is my favorite, Hell's Kitchen, Top Chef, Beat Bobby Flay!!! Sat down and had a $200 dinner for 2, looked around, the Patrons were older which we don't mind, we came to Phoenix to see Fleetwood Mac lol!   Cory ( who was not our waiter)  told me to turn my phone off (in an extremely aggressive tone)I was perplexed because I was was looking at the picture the  Matrie'D had just took of us so I thought Cory's request was out of line ( btw, the Matrie'D (the bald guy) was also very respectful and nice).  We were shocked because we have traveled across the world  from Australia to Miami and never been talked to in such a disrespectful way.  Btw we ate about 10% of their glutenous serving and left the doggie bag in the kitchen on the way out but still paid the bill and tipped our server +20% because my mom taught me right, where was Cory's mom tonight? . Don't come here ever, unless you want to open yourself up to a bad experience... I can go on and on about my opinions of discrimination but I'm educated enough to to stop while I'm ahead.  Good luck Durant's.  Once the millennials are left you can close your doors, sincerely GEN X.",

The appetizer is the trimmings from all the steaks on skewers with the most delicious sauce. The meat was just melt in your mouth good. What can I say about the steak, it was great. The strawberry shortcake lives up to it's reputation.",

We wanted to order a couple of items off of the lunch menu before 4 o'clock as that was the cut off. . He was down at the Other end of the bar talking with coworkers and when we tried to order before 4 o'clock, he said I will be right back I'm sorry I'm busy. He then returned after 4 o'clock and we decided not to order at all. We had high expectations of Durrant's from recommendations we have received from friends.

The complimentary soup of the day was navy bean soup, surely the best I've ever had. The garlic/leek buttered bread was a little bit soggy but tasty nevertheless. The main dish was even better than we had before and we ended with a slice of the best key lime pie we ever tasted. There are a lot of fancy restaurants in Phoenix but Durant's is by far the best and the classiest. Can't wait to go back to Durant's in the very near future.",

Last night, we met some friends here for drinks before heading over to watch a show at the Phoenix Theater.  It was a great meeting place.

    "text": "If the Rat Pack invaded Phoenix, we'd know where to find them...Durant's of course! Enter through the kitchen into this windowless establishment topped with red velvet walls, red velvet booths, dirty martinis and old Phoenix at your fingertips. If you've ever wondered what the Valley was like before the sushi restaurant invasion, just take a look at Durant's and you've peaked into the past.   Drive by Durant's and you'll see nothing but a cement building with a mobster-like neon sign out front. If I didn't know better, I'd say it takes a secret invite to get to walk through the mysterious entrance. But, lucky for me, it's not 1950-1960 and they don't require a special handshake to eat here. I was lucky enough to go here recently for a Friday night out on the town and given it's the holiday season, I grinned from ear to ear when I stepped inside Durant's and saw old school Christmas decorations like I'd just stepped into a scene of A Christmas Story.   First let's start with the cocktails because that's how every 1950/60's classic movie starts. I know. I should have ordered the famous Dirty Martini. But, will Frank Sinatra haunt my dreams if I admit I'm not a huge Dirty Martini fan? I thought about it, but I just couldn't make myself pull the martini trigger. Next time, Frank...just for you, I promise! I did have a nice glass of wine though and after a taste of a Belvedere pim's cup, I also learned that Durant's knows how to pour one stiff drink!   After the cocktails, the evening of cuisine began with the most buttery and garlicky loaf of bread staring us in the face. It's worth every garlic breath bite -- as long as everyone at your table consumes it too. For the entree, I had the wedge salad and the scallops. The salad was creamy and delicious and I like to pretend it was fat free (most definitely not). My meal came with not one, not two but six scallops. I wasn't expecting such generous portions! Top it off with garlic mash potatoes (yes, more garlic) and I had one delicious meal! I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my scallops which I feel like is a sin and I should be ashamed of myself. But the meal was spectacular and I can't wait to go again.   And... here's a huge bonus! Durant's is celebrating 60 years of being fabulous which is such an amazing accomplishment! What's even more amazing is that they are giving their guests a present when shouldn't it be the other way around? I don't know how long this will last, but if you visit during their celebration period, you'll receive a black poker chip (so fitting right?) and it's good for a free lifetime dessert every time you visit and have an entree! So it looks like I've been targeted as Durant's future regular guest and I'm happy to take on the task!",

The whole time we were eating, people were stopping and gawking right in front of our table watching the game.  Not only customers, but employees would pass by (on purpose) just to take a quick peek at the game.  It was quite distracting and annoying.  On to the food:  The bottle of moscato was amazing!  We ordered the crab cake with chipotle aioli and it was quite tasty and very flavorful.  We ordered the sirloin steak (medium) and it was quite chewy.  I'm not a red meat fan, but I really was not that impressed on the steak.  I also chose the sweet potato fries and that as well was not that impressive.  I have had better sweet potato fries elsewhere.   The tiramusu, however, was to die for and probably the best thing out of the meal.  On the bottom of the tiramusu was some kind of crunch of some sort - I love crunch on dessert!",

    "text": "Although we have been going to Durant's for years, we chose Durant's as one of our AZ Restaurant week pick.  It is of course one of our favorite places. Durant's has a veritable plethora of cliental.  During restaurant week you may sit next to someone who frequents Durant's or someone who is experiencing it for the first time, as we did.  It can be difficult not to give direction but the staff is very good at pointing you the way.  We are fortunate to have made acquaintance with a few of the wait staff. One or two I have known prior to there tenure at Durant's. It is coveted and difficult to get a job at Durant's, you must wait for someone to leave and that rarely happens.  One person I really miss is John, the bartender, who served for over 40yrs.  He was an icon at Durant's. When I was younger and had a lot less money I often sat at the bar with friends and chatted with him over a martini.  He taught me some tricks and life lessons in his quiet way. I had my fist and possibly last taste ever of the most amazing liquid desert, Louis XIII de Remy Martin, cognac. When you have waiters who are dedicated, dressed, able to interact one on one with each type of client, they bring you the best food & drinks, how can you go wrong?  If you want the feel of a good old classy chop house, that has the character, this is the place.  There are some other Steakhouses that offer great stakes, however, Durant's will remain my favorite for more personal reasons. I prefer the Rib-eye or Delmonico depending on my mood. Hit Durant's at lunch and have one of their burgers. If you like chicken livers give those a try here, my friends dad, who is Greek, even got the chef to wrap them in bacon for us one time. Talk about heart attack but boy were they good.  The Oysters Rockefeller are great.  If you get to visit when Stone Crabs are in at Durant's, take advantage of the Stone crabs they offer. Or get the Crabs and Steak.  They offer and extensive fine wine list. My recommendation for red wine drinkers like myself, check out the wine list on their website prior to dining. When you arrive at to dinner, have them open the wine and let it breath at your table. This way it will come to temperature out of the cellar and open up for a much more enjoyable taste with your meal.  I always order the salad with Roquefort, Durant's house dressing.  However, on this last visit Christopher ordered the shrimp bisque and it was amazingly rich and tasty.  Once yearly in late spring they offer a few bottles from their end of bin list.  Great bottles at half the price. I am pretty sure that is in the month of May.  I can go on about the food and the dining experience but just go there and have your own experience, taste it.  From the time you enter through the rear kitchen door and are greeted with smiles & welcomes from the wait & kitchen staff you will get to the Maitre D' with a smile already on your face as your eyes adjust to the surroundings of dark wood and red toile wallpaper.  Hey, get there early and hit the bar for your favorite cocktail. With the new no smoking laws in AZ you won't get the cigar or cigarette smoke that reminds me of the old days sitting at the bar with friends, talking to John. Good Friends, Great Steaks ,& the Best Booze, are the necessities of life.   -Jack Durant, Founder.",

Nothing fancy just good meat and potatoes.  After a visit to Durant's recently, I get the feeling they are trying to compete with a Morton's or Ruth's Chris style, white table cloth place.  It was bloody expensive - even now when my wallet is a little fuller than it was back then.  Fancy wine, fancy food, replaced all the old grouchy servers with your chipper ones.  The food is still good but its so highfalutin now. Back in my day there were cowboys, and old ladies in bedroom slippers at the bar.  Awesome. Doubt if college kids could come in Durant's and be able to feast and still make rent.  The prices, just wow.  Keep it cheap and funky!",

This is the exact type of place I like for a Steak house, absolutely perfect.  Some of the negative reviews here have me baffled.  Either 1) They went to a different place and got confused.  2) Can't tell the difference between vintage or old.  3) If you put 5 different quality steaks in front of them they would have picked the one drenched in the most sauce or glaze and based their opinion of taste on that.  With that being said, Outstanding appetizers,  incredible meal,  superb drinks, impeccable service, friendly staff, and I could go on and on.  Place was clean, decor was great, maybe the negative reviews were disappointed that the word \"Infused\" wasn't on the menu somewhere, or the fact that there wasn't some sort of a pumpkin ginger martini twist thing.  This place is a real joint, not some trendy flash in the pan that you'll regret that you ate at once it goes out of style.  Lighten up and enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Phoenix, my husband and I decided to stop by Durant's to try out their steak.  From what I heard and read, we had to try Durant's at least once during our trip.   Overall, we were pretty disappointed.  The only saving grace for this place is the decor which makes you feel like you walked into an old style restaurant in Hollywood.   The place was packed and crowded which is nice to see but the food was average at best.  My husband ordered the Cajun steak, which was their special for the night but it was extremely salty.  I had to dunk the meat in water to wash off the excess salt in order to swallow down the steak.   The prime rib I ordered was over cooked.   The garlic bread that everyone is referring to is terrible.  It's just french bread dunked in a bowl of olive oil with some garlic shavings on top.  Nothing special there.      The sauteed mushrooms we ordered as a side was also extremely salty.   Do they even taste their food before serving it to people?    If you're visiting Phoenix, skip this place because it's definitely not worth it.  We wasted a meal by coming here.",

One came out perfect the other medium, validating some of the inconsistency remarks made about this place. Fortunately, I enjoy my rib-eyes rare, m-rare, or medium, so it wasn't a big deal.   The bread they serve prior to the meal was awesome. Bread drowning in leeks, garlic, olive oil and butter. Sounds weird? Don't knock it til you try it.",

Our table wasn't ready so we started off at the bar with some of their famous martinis, which were delicious. However, the bartender who served us seemed a little overwhelmed. It was pretty busy. And the barback/bartender who actually collected our payment when our table came ready acted as if we were an inconvenience for him. Boo. Lost a star for that.  But all was restored when we were seated and began our meal. The service was great. We had a delicious meal. The Humble Steak was amazing. The pork chops were amazing. And the sides and appetizers were amazing. The portions were bigger than expected and we walked out fat and happy with a full-on grocery bag of delicious leftovers. YUM!   Also, I left my credit card and the staff was resourceful enough to find my phone number to call and notify me that they would hold my card in the safe until I could come get it. When I came back to pick it up, they quickly and politely returned my card after verifying my identification.   I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Durant's is old school.  Rat-Pack old school.  The reason elderly people love it is that is their style of gourmet food-- very traditional gourmet American fare. This was the fancy food of the fifties. The reason young people like it is because they romanticize a past that they weren't a part of.  My point is, it is not a place to go expecting a culinary revolution.  The food is very good, but not gastronomically exciting.  That said, this place is fantastic.  When you arrive, you walk through the kitchen, which sets the tone for the entire experience.  I imagine myself scurrying through the kitchen with Old Blue Eyes himself, smoking cigarettes, entering the back to avoid fanfare.  The decor is a striking fifties art deco, and everything is pleasantly vintage.  I can't help myself, I always order seafood when I eat here, and recommend the scallops.  Gotta have a gin martini too.  If there was ever a time or place to have a real martini, this is it.",

Served medium well.  Brought out a new steak...very rare.  By this time everyone else in the party was finished eating.  I left without having an entree.  However, they were magnanimous, they did not charge me for the steak I did not eat.   This place caters to those looking for a window into a nostalgic past, which is why I scheduled a birthday dinner at this establishment.  I left realizing going back in time is not all that it is cracked up to be...sometimes it just leads you to lousy food from a place well past its prime.  Goodfellas, old school vibe, please....look past the pictures on the walls and the red leather banquettes and the actual output is really just mediocre at best at premium prices.  This place is really very weak...I am just sayin....  They do not deserve to celebrate their 65th anniversary.  Service recovery was weak at best.  They have their regulars which keep this place busy, but there is no longer any pride in serving a good meal.  They really do not care about you.  So sad to see this establishment with a great history to descend to mediocrity on a good day.",

I'm not sure if I would consider this restaurant to have too much of a romantic ambiance because the lighting was quite bright and it was quite loud.  I would definitely recommend that if you coming with a date (as I did) to ask for one of the corner tables because they are a little more private and allow the chance for conversation.  If we weren't sitting right next to each other we probably would not have been able to hear each other.  I didn't have to ask for the corner table, but I've heard that it is best to request it.   I didn't really get the feel that the waiting service was that different than most restaurants with people who actually know how to wait tables.  I got the filet and it was excellent.  I would recommend this restaurant more for a boy's night out rather than a date.",

The steaks are top notch, service is great, shrimp cocktail is to die for, I've never had a bad meal here ever. I've been a patron for 17 years and never hesitate when someone mentions going to Durant's intact I usually drop what I'm doing to go.  The ambiance is completely mobster from the kitchen entrance to the red tucked booths, and dimly lit atmosphere. You must experience Durant's if you have never been or doing business in Phoenix from out of town.  Truly a top notch establishment!",

We were greeted by one of the kindest waitresses I'd ever been served by; she was polite, charming and witty- the perfect combination of a hostess!   By the time I was done with the not-so-side-dish-more-like-giant-main dishes, I was stuffed! The garlic potatoes were heavenly and thick and savory without any fat gravy on top. After the giant side dishes, I was greeted by a humongous rib-eye steak. I was unfortunately too full to enjoy the steak in all its glory but I can say that the key lime cake for dessert had me swooning by the end of the meal.   I'd recommend this place for huge steak lovers but if you like a lighter dinner, don't be too ambitious and order an 8oz rib-eye like I did... A smaller steak with scrumptious side dishes and key lime cake at the end of the meal will more than suffice.",

I knew about the famous dessert chip, but I never tried to get one.  Every time we have guests from out of town, we love to take them there and guide them in through the kitchen.  It is always a hoot to see their face.  We went for our big dinner this past October and I had as usual my lemon drop martini and my husband had his margarita.  We started with the shrimp cocktail, it is really delicious, the shrimp are huge and the cocktail sauce has a lot of horseradish.  We decided to split the larger fillet and have it with the mash potatoes and some steamed asparagus.  The fillet was delicious, super tender and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicky.   For dessert we had the strawberry shortcake, it was good, but not my favorite.  I like their creme brulee much better, but I wanted to try this one.  I got my chip! I just need to remember where I put it, haha.",

    "text": "Very unassuming place. From the outside you wouldn't give this place a second glance. I found out about it by asking one of the guys at the hotel i was staying at and im glad i asked. Once inside this place reminded me of an old style steak house. Dark woods, dimly lit and the wait staff and bartenders in traditional black and white formal wear with bowties!! Ive been in these places before so i knew i was in for a treat.   Onto the food. I started with a half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were delicious. While eating the oysters they brought out some bread which i didnt think twice about really. I dont typically eat bread when i got out because it just fills you up. That said, after the oysters i decided I'd have a piece. The bread was so f*ckn good. Its a small loaf that sitting in a mix of oil chives garlic and shaved parm cheese. I couldn't stop eating it. I may go back after writing this just for the bread. Its phenomenal! Dont pass it up. I ordered the bone in ribeye. I was praying that the bread wasnt going to be the best part of the meal and it wasnt. The steak was cooked to perfection. If you even think of putting steak sauce on a steak here you might be asked to leave. Now I travel a ton for work and have ate in some nice steakhouses but this place ranks right up there with the best ive ever had.   I didnt get into dessert unfortunately and the place is pricey but break open your wallet one time if your in the Phoenix area and youre a steak lover. Its a thing of beauty. You will NOT be disappointed.",

I think it's really cool and really old-school and I like that they have an updated it in a long time or at least made it seem like it hasn't been updated in a long time. I ordered the prime rib and I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail. They were probably the fresh shrimp cocktail I've had in years the prime rib was perfectly cooked the owes you was great and the horseradish was extra hot which is how I love it. The bread that came out was unbelievable as well and I can't believe I ate as much as I did we finished off with my girlfriend getting the Apple cobbler and I got the cheesecake. I love that the desserts are so homemade. Don't let down is that that they used to have the desserts on a tray that they bring out and then you just check it off of it but apparently that's gone. Anyway Ricardo is been there for about 19 years was a great waiter make good suggestions and looking forward to not saying away for seven years this time.  I use this with Siri so if something looks really messed up blame Siri",

    "text": "Last night we headed here for dinner.  Neither one of us had ever been, but my hubby had heard wonderful things about it.  They were right!  I grew up in Miami during the 60's/70's, and this restaurant brought back so many memories of my family going to fancy steakhouses, that I practically couldn't contain myself.  The decor is dark wood paneling with red brocade/velvet wallpaper, dark red leather booths, fresh flowers and waiters wearing vests and bow ties.  Honestly, I was expecting Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack to come waltzing in any second.  Now, onto the food...  When we sat down, we were immediately brought a crudite platter and bread (which was incredible!!).  We both ended up ordering the same thing, end cuts of prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes.  I got a salad and hubby got the clam chowder.    A little side story here...when I was younger, my dad told me to always order the end cut of prime rib, because I don't like rare/bloody meat.  This way, when you order, they know that you want medium well.  In most restaurants, whenever I've ordered the end cut, they still ask me how I'd like it done, which sorta pisses me off.  Our waiter, Robert (who was attentive and friendly), just said \"a good choice\", when I ordered mine.  That made me smile!  He knew exactly what I wanted, and that's exactly what I got.  The meal was so delicious and everything was timed perfectly.  We received our appetizers, which were very good.  As soon as we finished them, the busboy (who also made sure our glasses were always full), came by to pick up the plates, and as soon as he did, our entrees arrived around the corner.  I'm telling you...timing is everything.  I really hate when they bring the entrees and you're still attempting to finish your soup/salad or any other app you've ordered.  The prime ribs were so mouth-watering.  They weren't too fatty and melted in your mouth.  I dipped mine into the horseradish cream (they also had the option of raw horseradish, which we declined).  And, the garlic mashed were creamy and a perfect accompaniment to the prime ribs.  For dessert, I chose a raspberry sorbet (something light and refreshing) and hubby got the trio of creme brulee's (mixed berry, Bailey's and chocolate).   Overall, it was an experience that brought back memories and tickled the taste buds.",

We had reservations, came in the back door were greeted inside the kitchen as well as by the host when we arrived in dining room. We had appetizers, Spinach Dip, Oysters Rockefeller and Raw Oysters. All were superb. We had cocktails with the appetizers (2 - Old Fashions 1-Cosmo and 1 Cabernet wine) Dinner arrived and it was hard to pick the best but I say it was the Lamb Chops that were divine. The Crab Cakes had a delicious dipping sauce sprinkled on the plate and the cakes were moist, meaty and delicious. The guys had a big slice of Prime Rib that melted in your mouth and a Rib Eye Steak that was medium rare to perfection. We know that its rumored that Durant's has the best martini's around so the ladies each ordered a Dirty Martini to go with dinner. We will definitely do that again! The guys picked a couple great glasses of wine from the extensive wine list. I might add our waiter was the perfect gentleman and catered to all our wants and needs. We topped the evening off with a couple Creme Brulee and a slice of Key Lime Pie. Thank you Durant's for such a memorable evening. The staff, the food and the ambiance can't be beat. Your the Best!!",

Those are my favorite  servers. From the moment you go into this historic restaurant (go through back door via kitchen), you are greeted with a friendly host. They all know me by name which reminds me of a Cheers atmosphere. Here is what I recommend. Start off with some oysters and shrimp cocktail, bone in ribeye (med rare), caesar salad with anchovies, either the waffle fries or garlic mash.A must is the martinis. Check out an extra dirty belvedere martini up with blue cheeses olives or get a bottle of their amazing red wine (Truly). And for dessert...the strawberry shortcake (massive). You can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "This is one of those Phoenix landmarks you simply must experience.  Like a blast from the past, the old \"mobster style\" steakhouse with the big red booths and red velvet wallpaper.  You're just waiting for one of the Rat Pack to come around the corner at any second.   I must say that food is only second to the service, which is first class in this joint.    The food is top notch and, in my opinion, the best steakhouse in Phoenix.  But that service and quality come at a price.  I admit, I have never been there for dinner, because it is simply way to expensive for my budget.  My co-workers and I like to splurge once in a while and have a nice lunch, which (even with my free dessert token) costs around $25 dollars per person.  I go for the hot roast beef sandwich served with roast sirloin of beef with gravy, garlic mashed potatoes, fresh roasted vegetables and soup or salad.  And the fresh baked bread with the garlic, leek butter is just too hard to pass up, and you'll find yourself asking for more.  A lot of my co-workers go with the burger which, as they all say, is the best burger in Phoenix, and can rarely finish all of it.  We are lucky enough to be holders of the \"free lifetime dessert\" tokens they have and so how can we say \"no\" to a free dessert.  The strawberry shortcake is a no-brainer and, as all their desserts are, big enough to share.  The strawberries are fresh and ripe, with fresh whipped cream, however it is served with more of a \"cake\" than a \"shortcake,\" which in my opinion makes it better.  So for a unique experience, this place can't be missed.  But if you are on a budget, plan to come for lunch!  Reservations are recommend, and in most cases necessary...",

We arrived early and grabbed a couple bar stools when they opened up, had a great straight up dirty martini and she had a glass of Cab. They poured her a couple tasters until she found the right Cab for her taste. Res was for 845, we were sat by 9 but it was very evident that the staff was working hard to get people seated asap so we were not phased. Dinner started with a great bottle of wine our server recommended, the crab cakes, soup and salad, then my prime rib cooked to a perfect med rare, and her grilled scallops in herb cream sauce (to die for!). Yes, place was crowded and busy but in our giant booth for two, we were just fine and unaffected by any excess noise. All in all great experience, and yes, bring your wallet. If you are looking for a quick cheap steak, I think there is an Applebees nearby.",

Have been many times over the years, and went again with a friend a couple weeks ago.  Entering Durant's is always the bomb.  Since there is nowhere to park in front, your best entrance is through the back door and the kitchen.  Talk about getting your stomach rumbling!  Walking through (on the red carpet), and having the cooks shout a greeting is always fun.  And the smell of all the meat cooking......drool!  The ambiance is always great, and the servers have always been very knowledgeable of their menu.  Food was there fairly quick, and absolutely enjoyed my medium-rare prime rib.  So goooooood!  I always recommend Durant's to any of my friends saying they are looking for a steakhouse.  Give it a whirl!  You won't regret it!",

My steak was very dry, so dry that I had to ask for Au jou  to go with it and that still didn't help. Told the waiter that the steak was not right, he never even offered to get me anything else. He said oh we will take it off the bill and I'll send a manager over to check in with you. Well that's fine and dandy except said manager never even showed up to apologize. Then decided to order the creme brulee for dessert since I really didn't have any dinner, I could've made better creme brulee at home. The waiter never even asked me why I didn't eat my dessert and by this time, I am just too tired to mess with it.  For such a \"high caliber \"restaurant I would've expected better. What a $&$!?

Also this story makes me seem way more awesome when it's left a little blurry... blurry like I started to get after a few strongly poured cocktails at the bar. Thank FSM I had my tape recorder rolling.  Also thank goodness the meal was in the contract, because the place aint cheap. But a rare prime rib, crispy on the outside baked potato, oysters, crazy good bread, are worth it if you have it. I just soaked the front of my shirt with my Pavlovian salivation.  This place is classy as hell and all Rat Pack feeling. Yeah, I assume every review of this place has some reference to the Rat Pack in it but I didn't read any so I'm not going to feel bad about it.   I don't know how I managed to make it to 30 before my first trip here. I'm a Phoenix kid and it's a Phoenix staple. The crowd was a little Luby's but I like old people. It's cool.",

The host wears a tux and the waiters were similarly attired. The service was, for the most part, excellent, though they did have a hard time keeping up with us on the water. But they figured it out.  Really it was the food that I'm giving 3.5 stars. It was good. But for those prices in that atmosphere with their reputation and history ... well, good just doesn't cut it. I could have had good in a couple of dozen places for half the price. For example, I had salmon. It was good. It came with mashed potatoes that were reputed to be garlicky, and a salad that was mixed greens, three croutons and half a bottle of dressing. It cost about $30. The thing is, I had an equally good piece of salmon recently at Arcadia Farms for around $12 or $13. We shared a fruit crisp for dessert and it was the same thing. We paid $10 for a scoop of ice cream, a bowl of granola and a hint of apples and peaches. We could have gone up the street a block to Fez and had a much better dessert for less.  So I guess what I'd say about Durant's is this: go somewhere else - twice.",

As you enter through the back through the kitchen, you step back into the 1970s. We dressed up but other folks wore shorts or jeans; no flip flops. Valet parking is available. The petite 8 oz. filet mignon was delicious; tasty seasoning. We definitely suggest adding a half order of sauteed mushrooms to complete your entree, which includes soup or salad and a side dish. The waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary; we chose the original house cheesecake & it was a-maz-ing!! So creamy it melts in your mouth. Better than the Cheesecake Factory. I only wish I had left more room as I overindulged on the main course. Yes, it's pricey (for the 2 of us we spent $175 w/o alcohol and including tip), but the meal was delicious, the service was first-rate and it made for a memorable celebration. I expected Durant's to be hoity toity and I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't. The only negative is it's noisy inside and hard to hear your dinner companions.

He started us off with cocktails and did not rush us at all. His knowledge of the menu as well as his recommendations were excellent.   The martinis were prepared in a perfect manner.  The appetizers (wedge salad and chicken livers) were tasty.  I went with the ribeye which was cooked to perfection.  My girlfriend had the scallops which were prepared in a garlicky cream based sauce.  Both entrees were amazing!  We also ordered a nice bottle of wine off of the extensive list. We had notified management via online booking that we were celebrating a special occasion and they generously sent over a tray of desserts which included two types of Creme brulee- it was so good and so appreciated !  What a meal!",

Personally, I love to dine alone so I sit at the bar...Every bartender has made me feel so welcome...Gail especially! This restaurant is a bit on the pricey side, but they are so generous with the complementary bread, veggies etc it's 10000% worth it! I recommend the mussels & also the boozy cheesecake. This spot is for dates, business meetings, casual nights out or just for grabbing a cocktail. Enjoy!",

On Monday 6/24 we met another couple there for some work celebrations. My hubby & I arrived a few minutes after our friends and we waited over 10 minutes to place our drink order.  Fyi, the place was NOT packed. So the meal comes, and we're sitting at a booth and both of us girls are along the backside and the guys are on the ends. A HUGE cockroach is walking along the top of our booth & both of us feared it was going to walk on us & we frantically pushed our husbands out of the booth. The wait staff was a bit upset at us for causing a commotion.  No employee attempted to kill the bug & they were annoyed with us for causing a commotion.  They moved us to a table and neither of us could finish our meal. No remedy was made and we decided to never return here. Such a shame BUT their lack of reaction to the cockroach makes me think that this is the norm. Under no circumstances do I believe that dining with huge roaches is OK.",

The menu is loaded with classics and radiates a feeling of the old Rat Pack or Capone days. The lighting is dim with dark wood notes that paint a picture of what is yet to come.  I had the Bone-In Ribeye with loaded Garlic Mashed Potatoes. For an appetizer, we tried the sauteed chicken livers, Jumbo Shrimp w/ Atomic Horseradish and the calamari. All were delicious!   We chose three decedent desserts and split them among us. Booyah! Lonnie, our captain, led the charge and kept us on track for our experience.   The wine list is deep and offers many fantastic options. I kept it simple with the Freemark Abbey Napa Valley Cabernet. It was wound a little tight, but once it opened up it was fantastic!   The entire staff were cordial and very helpful. There are so many items on the menu that I want to try, so next time I'll have to bring Twyla. It is not an every day stop but for sure resonated a calling to come back.  They will see us again sooner than later. My hat is off to the entire crew!  #Durants #Vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #IrishcatV2",

The waiter was rude and I felt very discriminated against being an interracial couple dining there. I've never had that experience at any other restaurant! Disappointed.

Our server was unable to handle his guests, overstretched and absent. So when I asked another server for a glass of wine and was told a few minutes later that we would not be served anymore I had you come over and explain the reason. I asked you to sit and have a conversation with us, you gave a horrible performance of having to be responsible seving drinks. When pressed why you thought we were intoxicated  you said the martinis are strong???. One Booker's at bar 45 minutes before our table and one martini at dinner, that was for myself. I'm guessing the server was covering for himself and lied as to why I had to flag down another server, his lie was we were intoxicated.  My girlfriend is embarrassed as am I for your behavior and ass-covering.  Not once did we cuss, speak loudly, or bad mouth anyone. We dressed nicely unlike others in shorts and t-shirts.   Congrats, you treated us like we were a nuisance. You admitted we we're  not intoxicated but no apologies, no, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. We  were half done with our meal but soon it was all boxed to go, a sign we were to go. You offered to \"comp\" our food, that was your apology.   We chose your establishment and you chose to be God. My name is Mike Woelfel and I'm far from done with this as we have never experienced anything like the way you treated us. On our way out, your employees all standing outside and smoking we're decent enough to pickup the boxed leftovers which happen to be deposited across your parking lot. We don't eat tainted meat.  You ruined a special night, so please go fuck yourself.",

The decor inside reminds me of an old movie lounge which reflects the history of this restaurant perfectly w giant booths to sit in. The garlic bread that comes out is so hard to resist which is why by the time my main dish comes out, I'm already full but come on! You have to try it. It comes out warm covered w butter and leeks. And w each dish you get a Cesar salad!! So good!! The lobster is to die for. It's huge!! Almost the size of my arm. And I usually get the filet mignon medium rare and ask for a side of horseradish. They bring out two types. A creamy horseradish sauce and one just raw horseradish. The steaks are delicious always cooked to perfection with such flavorful spices that explode in your mouth. You also have to try the baked potato which is topped w bacon bits, sour cream and chives. And the broccolini!! I usually eat so much that I have to be wheeled out!! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good steakhouse.",

    "text": "I received very poor service. My family and I drove from California to attend my graduation and stoped at Durant's restaurant after. The waiter seemed upset with all of our request. We waited for than 2 1/2 hours for our food. Mind you I am 5 months pregnant and tired from the long drive. The food was also mediocre for the high price ($235) Anyways at the end of our dinner my husband card got declined because he forgot to tell the bank we were driving out of town. So I gave the waiter my card instead and, while he walked away, I heard him say \" hope this card works\" in a demeaning way. If you want to have a good dinner with friends and family do not  eat  here.",

    "text": "First time at Durants! A gift certificate brought us in. My husband and I got the 48 oz. porterhouse steak, baked potato, onion rings, and broccollini and for dessert their fruit cobbler with ice cream (Apple was the fruit). The service was great, people were very friendly and our server was friendly and even gave me extra ice cream! Yay!!  We ordered our steak medium rare. The outside of the state came back almost medium however the middle was medium rare and delicious. I totally understand that cooking a steak that thick and large is not easy however for over $100 for that alone I would expect they have their system down.  I also added more salt to it which hit my tastebuds a bit better. Overall I enjoyed the steak but after I added more salt and butter.  Potato hit the spot and the broccollini wasn't warm or seasoned. I like plain veggies so it worked for me but it could've been warmer. The onion rings were delish! Crispy and light! Yum!! The apple cobbler was warm and tasty and not super sweet so I was diggin' it.   Overall, Service was great and the people were very nice but when paying that much for a meal  I would expect that it comes out almost perfect.",

Nice glass of wine and scotch on the rocks. Thank you Durant's for making available a nice, reasonably priced glass of wine to enjoy our dinner with (cheapest glass of red wine at steak 44 was $30.00 per glass, which really made me mad).  Waiter, Andy, was wonderful. Perfect service...not too little or too much, kept an eye on us and knew when to ask if we needed anything. Really nice birthday meal. A little spendy at $200.00 for two people, but it was really a perfect steak. Greeted by maitre'd upon arrival...very friendly. Overall great splurge.",

I've dined at other much more expensive restaurants where the management acts as if they are doing a favor by trying to get you in! Durant's treated us as if we were not just customers but important customers! That my friends is what customer service is about! Durant's never disappoints and you simply can't beat them for excellent food and service to match!!",

My boyfriend ordered the porterhouse and got his name on the wall (but it won't be available right away) . but he fell in love with his steak steak. I got a filet mignon. My filet was tender and juicy i really enjoyed it. I'm not one eat steak as a preference but I really did like it, but if you want it with bacon wrap you must ask for it since it's not something they automatically add unless requested.   I was told they had the best martinis in town so i tried them,  mine was a dirty gray goose martini. Very good, strong olive taste but so good on the goose, just like i like it.   For dessert i has the creme brule; the tray confess with three , a chocolate, vanilla and blubbery, my favorite one was vanilla, so delicious. I can still taste it!   Yet our main highlight was The service , our waitress was so welcoming and so kind, being our first time there we had so many questions but she was just great at answering them. Thank you Durant!",

Everything was delicious. Service was fantastic. The furnishings are well kept and classic. I love that red wallpaper - I just want to touch it! I loved how the ladies' bathroom still has a payphone in there with a couch. The whole place gives off this amazing reminder of an era of class that is long gone otherwise.   We had the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. It has a huge clump of strong horseradish, so there's your fair warning. Anyway, our entrees came and our steaks were absolutely cooked to perfection. The husband usually inhales his food before I can blink, but this is the one meal he happily savored. Somehow, we saved room for the strawberry shortcake and I think I died a little. Bye-bye, diet! And I wasn't sad about it.   I recommend you save this place in your back pocket for a nice dinner when you want to look like a baller. Unlike husband who suggests coming here every single day for dinner to eat the porterhouse for free with an end goal of spelling out a whole sentence on one of their plaques. More likely is that we'll be back just to chill at the bar with one of their flawless gin martinis or a glass of scotch and take in the ambiance. And I can't wait.",

Our waiter along with another near by were completely obnoxious, pushing deserts like they were trying to make a used car quota. Skip this place and grab a steak at another American Bistro. Most offer at least one great steak at a reasonable price and of similar quality.",

Three of us shared the 48 oz porterhouse steak and still had some to take home!  We had the sauted mushrooms and they were the best we have ever had.  Other steakhouses are all a la carte but Durants provides a wonderful salad and your choice of a vegetable (all included in the price of the entree).  One last thing: we went there with a $200 gift certificate generously contributed by Carol McElroy to benefit the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra.  She and Durants deserve a special thanks!  We will make more special trips to Phoenix to eat here.",

So I finally made the trip to Phoenix along with her (she was on business) and had a great meal at Durant's. It really is a wonderful restaurant. Fine service, great presentation, nice and large bar area with every spirit you could imagine, mood lighting, lively atmosphere, free AND valet parking, centrally located. Are these enough reasons to try it?  I had grilled swordfish and mashed potatoes. Very yummy! Girlfriend got grilled bacon-wrapped scallops. Those were the best. I could have eaten 10 of them. The leftovers were even good the next day.   Drinks were strong but pricey. The dish of celery, carrots and radishes on rock salt and ice were a nice touch too.   Definitely worth the price.",

Dining area has Mafioso decor and intimate table settings (as well as not-so-intimate larger table settings for groups).  They have a nice wine selection, and help you pair up the right wine with your food.  COME HUNGRY!! They give nice, ample portions!  For our appetizer, we got Fresh Oysters on the Half-Shell and Crab Cake with Chipotle Aioli.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  Very fresh, savory and delicious!  I wish they sold bottles of their Chipotle Aioli sauce.  I would drizzle that on everything!!   We got the prime rib, which was cooked and seasoned to perfection!!  Their au jus is heavenly, and their horseradish is creamy but not too spicy.  Their Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes is their signature side dish with their prime rib.  I can see why.  It pairs beautifully!!  My dinner companion had their stuffed baked potatoes, which looked to be a meal in and of itself!!    Not a steak fan?  Durant's also has a nice chicken, seafood and liver (yes, liver) menu.    The prime rib leftovers are even better the next day with some over-easy fried eggs!  Durant's will also fill sauce containers with their dressings/sauces to take home so you have even more than you got with your dinner!    I highly recommend Durant's for an intimate romantic dinner free from kids or noise.  It's also great for large groups from work, family or a special event for friends!  I will definitely return.  I wish I had tried this place years ago!!  I have been missing out!!   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fencrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcSEoH9_QCUKtvfgTGTsK9ajzDOEZoZWPD3yYdjMrw9T7VkwRi1V&s=7d737f5670f4927b73022043d73142d067e0344343dfc7f3cecb9686045cd7ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.c...</a>",

Truly wonderful, the only thing I would change,  is the brownie being warmed up would of put this incredible dessert over the top! Our serving was very friendly & well versed on the menu.

    "text": "This is your proverbial \"special occasion\" restaurant. It's the place to take someone you want to impress. You may see politicians and judges in one corner, football players in another and maybe even a socialite or two (you'll know them because they don't take their sunglasses off, either because they are too cool, or the botox hasn't settled yet)  The valet parking is free, which is cool, but you don't have to use them, the parking lot is huge and you can self-park. Entering through the kitchen is a unique touch, but remember to open the door on the right to avoid bumping into a server coming the opposite way!  The interior is old-school and dated, but harks back to the days of old. Red plush couches and velvet curtains. Dark wooden tables and booths.  Robert was our server and he was excellent. Very personable and engaging. He knew when to come to the table and when to stay away. An awareness skill that other servers could learn.  The food was very good, which is only to be expected given the history of the place, but the prices were outrageous! The shrimp cocktail was $17.50 (5 U10s or U12s), served on the rim of an oversized martini glass over cocktail sauce, just like your grandma used to make back in 1976. The crabcake app was full of meat, priced at $19.95.  For entrees my gf got the salmon ($33.50) and I got the 12 oz filet ($60.50). To be fair, the entrees do include soup or salad and starch, but no sides. Robert asked us if it was our first time, and when we said it was, he bought us a dessert. That was a nice touch.  The bargain of the night was the wine list. We selected a 2003 Jordan cab, which was only $63. Robert expertly decanted the wine and it tasted great.  Would I go back again? Absolutely! But only if it was on an expense account or a long-lost rich uncle was picking up the tab.",

My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place near by while in the city. We were originally on our way to a different restaurant in our lyft. But we asked our lyft driver what she recomended for steak and she suggested Durant's! So we changed destination. And I'm so glad we did! We entered through the kitchen area which was really exciting for us. I was a bit nervous at first because in the past when going to fancy restaurants we are judged for our excessive tatttoos and being younger. I've noticed people don't take us seriously. But not here! Kevin (pretty sure that was his name) did a phenomenal job as our server! He was really attentive and had great suggestions, conversed with us when he had time and got really excited with our Polaroid camera. The place is dated but tastefully, having served for decades and having famous guest I felt it had a lot of character! I never felt disappointed once. The food is pricey but it has every right to be, you get what you paid for and beyond. To this day when my boyfriend asks where I want to eat I jokingly say Durant's even though we live in Chicago. Probably my 1# steak place in the country!",

At first I was a little disappointed that there was no steak on the restaurant week menu, but that soon passed. Our server was on point for our entire visit, drinks were always full, and he had a sense of humor.   First of all, that garlic bread they give you is super special, very original. Topped with leeks, garlic, herbs, marinated  in olive oil, it was  gone quick. I had the baked brie with a raspberry reduction w/ toast.....this was sooooo divine, it could have been a dessert. I could eat this everyday and love it each time. My entree was the citrus glazed salmon, it was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented the fish. The husband had the pork chop w/ au gratin potatoes...that pork was slammin'!!! Wow, it was thick, juicy, and ooh so good. The potatoes were yummy as well. For dessert we had the creme brulee and the chocolate cake. The cake was my favorite, chocolate & raspberry goodness served with fresh whipped cream.  We paid $40 per person and this included the 3 courses, glass of wine, and any other non-alcoholic beverage ( soda, tea, coffee ).   This place is not cheap, but the food & service is worth it, we will be back.",

We didn't send it back because we knew the meat would be tossed and a new steak would have to be prepared.  It was a birthday meal, we told waiter and manager.  No comp.  We didn't ask, they didn't offer.  We'll go back, but next time....we'll be sending the steak back if it's not prepared as specified.  Shame on the chef.  Otherwise the place is to die for.

You park in the back of the restaurant and walk in through the kitchen, how cool is that?!  Before I took a bite of food, I was a fan of this place.  After my first meal, it went to the top of my list.    Since that first visit, I've been back several times for lunch and dinner.  It never disappoints.  Some items I've had here:  Wedge Salad w/Gorgonzola Beefsteak Tomato Salad w/Bleu Cheese Crumbles French Dip 12 oz Filet Chop House Burger w/Cheese Side of Rice Pilaf  For lunch, my 2 fav items are the French Dip and the Chop House Burger w/Cheese.  They're very good and fill you up nice.  For Dinner, I always get the Filet.  It's my favorite cut of Beef and Durant's does a great job with their Filet.  I like to have it with a side of Rice Pilaf....yum!  The Salads here are pretty big, so I recommend splitting them.  The Wedge Salad is my fav....crispy, juicy Lettuce and creamy Gorgonzola....yes!  Service here is spectacular as well.  Its always been perfect for us.  I wish I lived closer to this place.  Return Factor - 100%",

We started with the Oysters Rockefeller. Just diaster. Looked like an artichoke spinach dip with oysters at the bottom. Waiter noticed and took them off our check. My girl and I shared the $100+ Porterhouse Steak. As soon as it hit the table (it was cooked right medium-rare) the fries were cold and the steak was dry. The entire top was extremely dry...no moisture, extra chewy, and it lacked seasoning. How does medium-rare steak not have a juicy texture. It was almost like a dry Roast beef. We sent it back and passed on dinner. Unfortunately, we just had the asparagus. Celebration gone wrong, but the drinks were good. We also noticed that the table across from us had a similar problem. The kitchen was not on its A game. Huge upset.",

We decided to go back again on Friday and all I can say is the mood was completely different. The older gray haired man working the hostess counter and his entire crew were useless and act as if we weren't good enough to be eating there. The acted as if we were invisible. We asked questions about seating in bar area and were completely ignored. We ended up leaving! You liked us when we were in our suits but not when we were dressed in our casual clothes. Your loss of another $1000 sale and all potential sales. We will never be back.....  You lose!",

    "text": "Durant's - I love you. I really love you, but please don't do Restaurant Week next year unless you really want to make a go of it. The point of RW is to entice new customers, not turn your regular customers off.   My friends and I do the RW thing every year. The values and the opportunity to experience somewhere new at said value is pretty enticing. We made reservations on Thursday night around 8 and the place was more full than I have ever seen it on a weeknight. This made me happy, because I want this place, with it's cozy atmosphere, above and beyond service and fabulous martinis to remain the Phoenix institution it has become.   We chose two different entrees, ordered a martini (no let down here - see above - fabulous) and settled in to the big burgundy booth surrounded by coordinating crushed velour wallpaper. I just don't have a kind word to say about anything that came after the martini. Our appetizers were very very okay. I received possibly the most over cooked steak I have ever had. I've never done this, but I sent it back. The service was, for the first time in all my 10 years of visiting, sub par. I am not sure how our waiter wound up in a fine dining establishment, when he couldn't serve his way out of a TGIFridays.   I suggested Durant's to several people for restaurant week because I really couldn't believe such a great spot could have such an awesome deal going. Based on this dining experience I would really have to say this was a 2 star dinner, but that 10 years of 4-5 star dining experience is causing me to round up. In retrospect this may qualify as more of a rant than a review. But, I'd prefer to pay full price and have my previously pretty high expectations met.",

    "text": "We wanted to treat newlywed friends and I'd never been to Durant's. Thought it a great opportunity to see if it warranted all the good that I've heard about it.  It did and then some. Perfect prime steakhouse atmosphere, from the kitchen entry to the deep red leathers and dark woods that fill the surprisingly large place. We sat in the main dining room, but it appeared that the dining area near the full bar seated nearly as many. Lots of talk, laughter and fun everywhere without the noise level ever being a factor.  Service was impeccable. I want an attentive staff that will listen to what I'm expecting, not one that hangs over my shoulder to scrape every miniscule crumb from the table. We indicated to our server that we were in no rush. She timed everything prefectly, giving us time to enjoy our cocktails, appetizer, salads and meal without ever rushing one course on top of the other. Just the way it's meant to be done.  The food? Exceptional. The fresh oysters were just that, and I loved the spicy horseradish. I'm not much of a bread eater, but all three companions swooned over the garlic bread. Salads were all fresh, plentiful and flavorful. My medium-rare prime rib looked like a cookbook example. Truly didn't even need a fork to cut it, wonderfully trimmed. Superb. KT had the filet medium rare. Outstanding crust, yet so delicate and pink inside. Our friends each had the same (filet and prime rib). They preferred theirs medium and well (I love them anyway), and raved about how fantastic they were.  Durant's is a Phoenix dining experience that should not be missed. Can't recommend highly enough. Bring your appetite and your wallet, but quality of food, service and presentation of this sort is worth every penny.",

    "text": "Durant's is old school cool. I really dig the vibe inside. Very dark and red-velvety and retro chic.  The service was top notch. Our server was on his game. Our wish was his command. He even offered to run across the street to the convenience store and grab us a Twinkie for dessert if we so desired. He was joking, but I bet if we really did ask it would have been so.  Superb wine list. Massive and filled with great offerings. The sommelier was very new, but he was knowledgeable enough to confirm my hunch about '06 Cabernet Sauvignons from Napa Valley (they're good).  Get the shrimp cocktail. Do it. The shrimp are gargantuan, and they're served with an atomic-level cocktail sauce that will singe your nose-hairs and make you slap your knee or pound your fist on the table. That's a good thing. Life is too short for wimpy cocktail sauce.  The table bread was unlike anything I've had before. It was cut up into chunks and drenched in melted butter and leeks and other seasonings. Very tasty. Comes with the salad course. Oh yeah, order your salad with the Garlic French dressing. Don't ask questions; just take my word for it.  There were less appealing details about our meal too. The sides (of mashed potatoes and fries) came out lukewarm at best. That's a shame; and should never happen in a fine dining situation.  Also, the the steaks are cooked completely on a grill -- not a completely bad concept, except that when cooked even to only a medium rare, there ends up being a huge ring of well done meat surrounding the juicy red interior. What a way to ruin a delicious Filet Mignon. Other steakhouses will sear the outside of the steaks briefly and then finish them in a supremely hot oven for more even cooking. I doubt if Durant's wants to change the way they're doing things; but it's also why I won't return there for a steak.  I would like to return though. I found my dining experience at Durant's very enjoyable. I'll go elsewhere for a delicious Filet Mignon, but I'll be back to Durant's for the wine, and shrimp cocktails, and maybe I'll try those scallops I've heard good things about. Also, it's a Phoenix landmark, and just very cool Rat-Pack-ish place to hang.",

    "text": "You like old school? Downtown restaurants don't get more old school than Durant's. The decor and the atmosphere haven't changed in all in the decades they've called this building home (I know this only because my parents told me so).   I actually took a trip here as a matter of curiosity (and the fact my folks were treating me to a birthday dinner and it was therefore free). I didn't really have much knowledge of the place but I had been told it has the feel of a mafia hangout. They're right about that part, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you go. Aside from that, I knew little about the menu other than it was a steakhouse. Now that I've been, a few lessons I've learned.   First, I am the worst son in the world. I had no idea just how expensive this place was. I'd been to some relatively pricey steakhouses before, but yowzaa! $20 for a caesar salad??? $50 for fillet mignon??? $75 for a porterhouse??? My parents are saints for paying this much for a birthday meal. Second, happy hour at this place is absolutely packed. Apparently their bar area is very popular with the downtown workers during the week. And third, this place is top notch in terms of class and tradition. From the wallpaper, to the kitchen and waiting staff, to the lighting and furniture decor, this place is super elegant. You can definitely feel the ghosts of local and worldwide celebrities that passed through this place.   Now for the food. Mostly good, but price is needless to say a little over the top. I understand that ambiance and service count a lot in terms of how a restaurant prices out their menu. But I'm sorry, no caesar salad is worth $20 (and yes it was good). For dinner I got the 12 oz. fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and soup ($50 in case you're wondering). I was content to not make my folks buy dessert, but they insisted so I got the fudge brownie pie ($9). The steak was tasty and well prepared and the dessert was delicious. So in terms of the food itself, I have no complaints. I'm not even going to reveal just how much my folks dropped on this meal. Let's just say I owe a lot of favors after this.   So here's a brief summary for all of you. I would recommend giving this place a whirl at least once. Preferably when you've saved up enough to really (and I mean REALLY) splurge. As frightening as the prices are, you really are buying an experience when you come here. The waiters take excellent care of the patrons, walking through the kitchen area is an experience unto itself, and you won't hear too many of their customers ever complain about the quality of the food. If you can't afford a meal, maybe stop by for drinks during happy hour as its pretty lively. Granted, I can say all of this because I got to enjoy this for free. Would I pay to go again? Sure. Just as long as I'm in a great mood.",

We got our salads and soup about seventy minutes after we ordered our meals.  We never saw the steaks because the waiter still ignored us.  I asked her for the bill so we could just leave.  She never apologized she just said that she got a little behind.  Funny thing about her statement is Durant's was not very busy.  I guess others found out about the lousy service before me.",

The french dip is a large portion, tender, and with perfect au jus.  The bacon BBQ onion and cheddar burger was a favorite also.  Good starter salad and fries as well.  Wines by the glass were fine.  They were packed for lunch but they were able to seat us almost right away.  The quality of the food and service were both great.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.",

It comes with your choice of garlic mashed, rice, or baked... the mashed were good.  It also came with the choice of soup or salad before the entree. The first time i came here i tried the soup, it was a corn chowder, it was pretty good for a starter.  The second time i was here i got a ceaser salad, ehh.... We also had the strawberry shortcake.... very good... enough for about 4-6 people tho...  $$$",

From the low ceilings and red nail head upholstered booths to the vintage wallpaper, the decor does not disappoint.  It is so reminiscent of an era long ago and makes for a fun escape.  The bar area is terrific and I recommend going early for your reservation so you can enjoy a cocktail before your dinner just to take in the environment.  The entire staff is friendly and courteous and willing and wanting to make your experience wonderful.  The quality of the food is superior.  The wine list is extensive and the cuts of beef are excellent.  For an appetizer we enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and the presentation was terrific and the horseradish tasted superior.  The signature house bread was not my favorite.  It was covered in oil and herbs and quite honestly was difficult to eat and rather disgusted me.  I would have rather had no bread at all or simple crusty sourdough I could break into small pieces and top with fresh butter.  I had the house salad with blue cheese dressing and it was heavenly!  The salad was absolutely covered in the dressing. In the future I will ask for the dressing on the side but it was so delicious I didn't worry about it and enjoyed every bite.  My petite filet was medium rare and it was flavorful, lean and cooked to perfection.  For my side I had the garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and absolutely yummy.  Dessert  included a trio of creme brulee and coffee which was excellent.  I would recommend Durant's for your next special dinner out.  It is a Phoenix jewel and everyone needs to experience it.",

I totally see it, the place reminded me of some of the dark, cavernous, seething-with-history establishments in D.C.  The calamari was delicious as were the mini sliders.  We only went as far as appetizers.  Service, while it started out very good, started slipping.  We sat in a booth by the bar and while waters were constantly refilled and plates cleared, it took the waitress a half hour to bring the bill.  That is really inexcusable especially because we were in a hurry.  She also messed up a couple drink orders.  I admit that it was busy, but if she had too many tables, someone else should have stepped in.",

    "text": "This place is about as \"traditional\" as a steakhouse can get. Wood paneling everywhere, stuffed red leather chairs, linens, waiters in black vests and bow ties, the whole nine yards. It's like you walked into downtown Chicago 40 years ago. I also love the fact that you enter through the kitchen...nice touch!  This review is predicated on the fact that my wife and I both ordered exactly the same thing, so it's kinda one-note.  We started with a crab bisque...really good! Strong crab flavor, creamy, it's obvious they've been doing this stuff for a long time because it just had an old-fashioned, old family recipe kind of taste.  We both had ribeyes on the waiter's recommendation. We were going to order the 70 oz porterhouse for 2 but we had a nice discussion with the waiter about the difference in cuts and ended up with our old standby, ribeye. The waiter was very knowledgeable about steaks but you expect that at this kind of place.  Honestly, after racking my brain over all the steaks I've had in all kinds of steakhouses, I think this may be the best one I've ever had. Perfectly rare, nicely seasoned and loaded with flavor. It tasted as though they'd just slaughtered the cow. Just perfect! Also extremely good garlic mashed potatoes. The asparagus side was steamed, plain, and just eh.  The desserts were just okay, which leads to the reason Durant's only gets 4 stars and not 5. The prices were extremely high. Our ribeyes were $59 each; the plain, steamed asparagus was $9 and a slice of cheesecake and a slice of not-very-good key lime pie were $9.50 each! You could make an argument for steaks of that quality at that price, but certainly not for the dessert.  Overall though, still very good. We just know now to get the straight up dinner and avoid the sides and desserts in the future.",

Started with Oysters Rockefeller.  I have never had them as good as they make them here.  I could have probably just ordered that as my main course and been happy.  If you ever come here, you must try them.  I am not a fan of oysters but they are the best!  My husband had the 12 oz Prime Rib, which was quite tasty but a little too fatty.  My father also had the Prime Rib and mom had the ribeye steak.  I had the 8 oz. Filet and it was perfection.  I also had the spinach salad (came with the meal) and it was very good.  The wait staff was attentive and kept our water glasses, and coffee cups, filled.   It is expensive and was a splurge for us.  I have been here several times and the service and food is always consistent.",

I've lived in Phoenix over 22 years and have never been to this landmark Phoenix steakhouse.    The food was just OK.   It didn't WOW me.   I ordered a sirloin it came with salad, veggies and baked potato.  Other person in the party ordered on of the \"Fatman's\" specials.    These specials change daily.  He chose the blackened prime rib sandwich.   It had cheese and onion rings on top.   The bread they serve is topped with olive oil, basil, leeks and garlic.    My steak was way underdone and I had to send it back.    I think that if an establishment is noted for their steak it should be prepared correctly the first time.   The server was very pleasant and knowledgeable and did provide us with a complimentary dessert which was key lime pie.  Very good pie.   I probably would go back just to give it a second chance.",

From the moment you enter through the kitchen (which made us feel like VIPs), to the greeting at the host stand, to being seated at our oxblood-leather tufted banquette, you're treated as royalty.  Red-flocked wallpaper, luxurious floral arrangements (even in the ladies' room), and Sinatra crooning in the background -- who could ask for more?  Well, we could, and that would be food to match the ambience.  Oh, they did not disappoint.  We shared a calamari appetizer and both ordered the calves' liver -- delicious!!!  All of this voluptuous elegance was served up by the best waiter ever, Patrick McCausland.  He is a consummate professional and we'll definitely be asking for him next time.  The wine was nectar, the food was ambrosia, and Patrick was beyond compare.  We can't wait to go back!",

This is one of the very last vestiges of old school cool left in town.  This is one of the last places you can envision a star of decades past coming in and getting blitzed and creating history.  If that wasn't enough, they also pour some of the best martinis and specialty/throwback cocktails in town.  The Sidecar is fantastic, and if you are a Manhattan fan (this one's for you Dad), look no further.  As far as the food, this is one of those places where you can spend as much or as little as you like and leave happy.  If you just want a relatively affordable night at the bar, order the Durant's Debris and a Shrimp Cocktail, eat the complimentary garlic bread and leave stuffed and ecstatic.  If you want the full dining experience, get pretty much any entree (delmonico and salmon come especially recommended) a side of crab mac and cheese and the strawberry shortcake for dessert.  The service will be impeccable, that part is certain, and you will feel like you have stepped into a time or place where displaying a degree of class counted for something.

For an appetizer we had Calamari which was perfectly fried and came with a spicy dipping sauce.  It was probably the best Calamari we've had in awhile. My husband had the chicken and rice soup, the 12 .oz filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. We had no idea chicken and rice soup that you eat growing up a child could have so much potential.  It isn't your average soup.  His steak was cooked perfectly and he said it was the best steak he has had in years. I had the caesar salad, Chicken Piccata and garlic mashed potatoes.  The caesar salad was good.  I wish I had ordered the soup instead though.  The chicken was delicious, but I've had better.  I guess what they say is True, you don't order chicken in a steak house, but I'm just not a huge fan of red meat.  I probably wouldn't order the chicken again, but it was delicious over all.  For the price I would prefer something else and I would try a different chicken dish or the sea food.  Everything was great, even the service.  We would both go back again when visiting.  Our meal was $180.00 total, but totally worth it.",

The soup and sandwich that I enjoyed for lunch was reasonably priced an flavorful. In fact I was somewhat supprised at the lunch value of this higher priced establishment. For dinner the fresh Snow Crab was a nice compliment to my Surf and Turf experience. The menu is large enough to satisfy a broad spectrum of palates. The entry through the kitchen from the rear of the restaurant is somewhat odd but this has been the way for many years and is unlikely to change. Some may enjoy this peek into the kitchen while others may find it somewhat disruptive to the formal dining experience. I enjoy this restaurant with its fresh food and decor from years past. Avoid this one if you are looking for a casual quiet evening as Durants is often packed throughout the evening. A couple cocktails at the bar, business meeting or a social dinner with friends is a more the feel here. Service is fantastic as many of the staff has remained for more than a decade.",

As you walk in, to a pleasant surprise, you walk through the immaculate kitchen with wood burning fire and are greeted by the head chef and his sous' (which reminds me of the Steadicam shot in Goodfellas). Then you are greeted by the low lit, red velvet interior with the classical c-shaped red leather booth's. The waitstaff are very good and extremely consistent. They are in no hurry to move your table which I greatly respect. Don't forget to devour the complimentary bread and ask for another round. I recommend ordering the oysters rockefeller app, house salad with Roquefort and filet mignon w/twice baked potato. Sublime! You will be stuffed so wear your fat clothes. If you have room, the strawberry shortcake desert is delicious (or have them box it up to go!). The wine list is very unique and would please any wine snob or casual wine-o. Pulling up a seat to the bar is not a bad gig either as the bartenders are very friendly and good conversation can be made with the \"coug's\" surrounding. Best part, dress how you want. I've seen CEO's dressed to the T's and white-trash \"Chaz\" in frayed jean shorts with a mullet of Utopian proportions. Prices have jumped a bit in the last 2 years but still well worth it (and whose prices haven't jumped?).

    "text": "I have heard great things about this place and read many great reviews just to be severely disappointed. My first and last dining experience was on my birthday. My server Lonnie did say happy birthday at the beginning of our meal and that he would send out dessert since I was celebrating. We ordered a bottle of wine, a Tuscan blend to be exact and it was amazing. We ordered a second bottle of the same wine and were given a Chianti classico instead. We mentioned the label was different when he presented it, which he agreed with, but continued to open and pour it anyway. We told him it also tasted different so his solution was to bring new wine glasses. Not sure how that makes sense since it wasn't the wine we ordered or wanted. He finally went to \"check why the label was different\" and indeed realized it was not the correct wine. It took a long time and some attitude from the server to get the right second bottle. He made us feel like it was our fault he brought the wrong wine. Anyway, we ordered dinner. Appetizers and salads tasted great. We did have to stack our plates and move them to the side because we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for over 20 minutes. Dinner took a while to come out and when it did, 4 of the 5 entrees were ice cold. My prime rib was a grayish color and everything looked and tasted like it was sitting out for some time. He took the entrees back to the kitchen and returned a few minutes later with our dinners reheated. Dinner was still cold and the steak and shrimp were rubbery. I too am a server and understand things happen, but I am less upset about the food, and more upset of how we were treated. I am not a picky person when it comes to food and it really takes a lot for me to complain or write a review. The nicest thing I can say is those meals should have never been served. It took one of us looking for a manager to speak to for any of this to even be acknowledged. The manager came to the table to stare at us blankly and said we only were going to pay for the wine. If the roles were reversed I would not drop a check and send dessert. He didn't seem like he cared about anything or wanted to deal with what was going on. I left my birthday dinner hungry and dessert-less. I will not be back or ever recommend coming here to anyone.",

    "text": "It was a really nice experience.  Our waitress was wonderful and the steaks were very good.  I ordered the t-bone which I do not normally get so I'll return for the filet.  I enjoy these \"old school\" steak houses that take you back to the 50's and 60's.  You feel like you are on a set for either a gangster movie or Mad Men.  If anything Durant's was lacking some of the nostalgic quirks I've come to love from these sorts of places.  You do go in through the kitchen, the booths are straight from the 60's, you get this little platter of random veggies, and the service is great (completely out of place in 2014!).  But I would love to see the waitress prepare something table side.  I've seen them do the salad or baked potato at a number of places not to mention the dessert.  Durant's would be a talked about experience with some of those extra touches, but even without its a throw back gem.",

Clubby rat pack atmosphere, comfy leather banquettes, red lighting and wallpaper, stiff martinis straight up, tuxedo clad servers, entrance through the back kitchen (just like old-school LA restaurants).  So much character, so much CLASS, and you haven't even gotten to the food or service yet!  It's pricey here, so it's usually a special occasion/I'm gonna get laid sorta restaurant.   I came here for happy hour recently, and it was then I realized I hadn't reviewed this or eaten here in a long time.  I usually order a steak (New York), but yes, the seafood is pretty good here too.  The servers are top notch, (great sale pitches) and professional in every way in my visits.    The martinis here are easily contenders for the best martinis in Phoenix.  The bread loaf with the garlic spread is a good munchie, but let me tell you all you need is two martinis to call yourself done, if you know what I mean.",

They are also known for their martini's.  The problem was that I am a big Strip Steak fan and it just did not deliver. I might have had the filet last time, but it was just okay.  The garlic potatoes are also good too.  The biggest problem I have is that I made this reservation WAYYYYYYY in advance and my boyfriend and I were put in a table that basically was in the middle of the aisle.  I didn't think I needed to ask for a booth because I had a standing reservation, but apparently not.  That kind of bothered me.  I don't think it was worth the price and the table was HORRENDOUS.   I probably wont be going back again. BUT, I think people should try it. It is good, just not good enough for me to continuously return.",

    "text": "It was the perfect ending for an afternoon at the theater. My wife and I just saw \"Venus In Fur\", at  the \"ATC\". Durants opened at four  and was't far from the Herberger theater.  We were the only ones in  the room except for an older gentleman with two lady friends.  They were sitting 3 tables down from us and we could hear every word he said. He was talking WAY TOO LOUD.   Fortunately  the service and the meal eased our pain. Natalie from France did an expert job making our experience enjoyable  and memorable. When we sat down we were hungry and we did not have to wait long for relief. A plate of very fresh and crunchy vegetables  with a creamy dressing started us out. Next came a steaming bread plate with an oil and leak marinade to die for. Normally we would of gone for salads but we went for the soup and we sure made the right choice. It was a clam chowder a cross between Manhattan  and  New England. Lots and lots of yummy clams.   For our main course  I went for a 12 oz sirloin and my wife had the prime rib. Natalie's suggestions produced our meals coming out just the way we  wanted.  Natalie told us we could get half orders of the mushrooms and broccolini and we did.  There were no weak links. Durants hit the ball out of the park. A perfect meal ended with a perfect dessert, a Creme Brulee threesome, yummy !!!",

    "text": "I've had some great business lunches here, but I have to say I was incredibly underwhelmed this last visit.  I took my fiancee and a friend in from out of town there.    Let's talk food: Since my fiancee and I usually each order an entree and switch halfway through dinner, for the first time ever, I ordered something other than a steak. I got the crab cakes and he got a T-bone. The steak was good - cooked right, tasted as expected, but to me, wasn't a $47 steak. That's the price I would expect of an exceptional steak.  Then there were the $43 crab cakes. When I first got them I was disappointed because there was so much creamy sauce on the plate and I am kind of a crab cake purist: lump crab meat, minimal filling, a little lemon and seafood seasoning.  After a few bites of really dry, not so tasty crab cakes I realized what the sauce was there for.  We left one whole crab cake on the plate after pushing food around and decided to just finish the steak and leave it alone.  I decided that I knew better of this restaurant and that i wanted to finish off dinner on a positive note. I decided to order dessert to erase the crab cake incident from memory. I ordered an apple crisp, which was barely better than the crab cake.  Bland soggy crust, overcooked apples, no \"crisp\" or topping other than the ice cream...  I had three bites and didn't eat any more of that despite being hungry.   Then there was the service: The waiter we had wasn't outright rude, but he definitely was not nice, kind or gracious, and it appeared that he had a bit of an attitude with our out of town guest who happened to be foreign (but speaks English).  He never once asked about the food. Leaving half your dinner and 90% of your dessert warrants at least a \"Was everything ok?\" which we definitely did not get.",

We had to wave him down every time we needed something, he took my drink away, I guess he didn't think I needed any more diet coke, we had to practically beg to see a dessert menu. We all felt very rushed and un-welcome :(  On the bright side tho we left with 4 very happy stomachs!!

So I go to Duran'ts expecting the worst & hoping for the best. So what do I say? The sides are old school home style offerings & nothing to write home about. My steak was good & prepared to my request (which if you want to know is rare). However the creme brulee trio, martini's, staff & ambiance are what will coming back for decades. I psychotically love a good creme brulee. The fact that all 3 flavors were good blew my mind. The dirty martini I ordered was dirty, heavily poured & delish. The staff was knowledgeable & attentive. The ambiance is beyond awesome. It's also old school with high booths, wallpaper & old pics of the now passed owner & his pooch. My only request would be to revamp the sides & the bathrooms. I had a great time & will be back. Heck I've already been back for a lunch burger. That was good too.",

Service: was okay nothing over the top. Matter of fact the waiter forgot what I ordered about twice, but I wasn't upset. They were on point with keeping my glass of water filled, kudos.   Ambiance: Romantic, my Wife and I really enjoyed the booths, tapestry walls and red accents throughout (my favorite color).   Food; We had the oysters, saute mushrooms, 18 oz Rib-eye, 14 oz Porterhouse, Garlic Mashed potatoes, baked potato, cheesecake and tiramisu.   My Wife and I agreed the steaks where about a 9 out of 10, then from there the rest of the food was well average. In the case of my garlic mashed potatoes, that was below average they just had a taste and flavor or was paper or just some kind of pasty texture I didn't finis them, they weren't horrible just not what I expected. Backed potato and saute'd mushrooms where average (I could make these).... But the cheesecake and tiramisu... \"Damn!!\" so good... I'm not really into sweets as much as steaks but I'd almost go back to just eat that cheesecake again.  So at the end of it all... for the amount they charge and the flavor of food and well everything else.. I just wasn't that impressed. It's not horrible, mind you. For the amount of money, I've had excellence service, and outstanding food... Was nice to finally see what is was all about.",

    "text": "So...took a girlfriend to Durant's this past weekend for what I thought was going to be a delicious steak.  She had the sirloin and I had the filet.  Both steaks were WAY WAY WAY too salty, and very overcooked.  The atmosphere was stuffy and dark, felt kind of depressing and the price seemed extreme for a mediocre steak.  Also, the manager was handing out coins for a free lifetime dessert...BUT we could not use it that night.  After spending $80 on a meal that was ok at best, a free dessert would have been nice.  Not sure I'll ever go back and use the coin...",

There was even a diner at the bar wearing a cowboy hat, which, makes senses given a guidebook wrote that Durant's is the place where business deals are done by old school business men wearing boots and cowboy hats. And entering through the kitchen made me feel like I was in Goodfellas.     Ambiance gets  five for the novelty factor where the food gets a three.  What really makes Durant's worthwhile is that the price of a steak includes a salad or soup and a side and are what you'd pay at a comparable a la carte steakhouse.  In its category Durant's is worthwhile going back to.",

It was juicy and very flavorful.  My boyfriend's steak came with horse radish on the side.  This place know's the real meaning of medium rare and how to pair flavors!  My mouth is watering as I think about those flavors.  I came here with family, and I was not prepared for the awkwardness that ensued.  Everything is expensive!  I heard \"Steakhouse,\" and dressed in jeans.  I should have Yelped first!  I was very under-dressed and uncomfortable.  It was a situation where I regretted ignoring those etiquette lessons on which fork to use.  When a family member went to the bathroom, the waiter quickly switched her old linen napkin with a fresh, folded napkin!  My only real qualm, as my previous complaint was due to a lack of preparation and socioeconomic status, was the wait-time.  We had reservations, and we still had to wait over a half hour for our table.  We weren't the only ones.  There was nowhere to stand or sit as we waited because the place was packed.  Why bother with a reservation?  [That is sarcasm.  If you are coming here on a busy night, you better get a reservation.]",

As usual, the food and service were top notch. Durants always get the steak temperature perfect. The garlic mashed was hot and tasty. The bread is always a highlight and the homemade salad dressings are the best in town.  When you eat in the bar so you get skewered meats and cheese with your cocktails. I think that is great touch and its unique.  The bar had no IPA. They need to join the 21st century and stock some microbrews!!! Also the prices are approaching the limits of what I will pay for a great meal, but Durants is still tops in my book.",

I can honestly say not only have I had fantastic meals here, but, the service is always spot on. The decor is old school which I love. You really feel like you stepped back in time with the red booths and traditionally dressed waiters. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the maitre d. It is one of the few places in town where I love dressing up to dine out, as the atmosphere is totally conducive to that. (No worries if you want to go casual -it is my own personal preference when I dine at Durant's-something about the atmosphere makes me want to wear a dress.) :)  I love their shrimp cocktail. It is fantastic. I am not even a steak eater anymore-I realize that is what they are known for but I love Durant's none-the-less. Their fish dishes are really good.  I love their crudites when you are seated-there is something magical about their ranch dressing.  I need to mention the bussers. I drink A LOT of water. Those guys and gals hustle-they are top notch. My water glass is never empty long and I appreciate that.    Nice wine list, and their wines are reasonably priced.",

There is a reason they have been around for over 50 years and they are always crowded (which is pretty amazing since it is really easy to spend $100 or more on dinner for two). The food was spectacular, as was the service. The water they serve is bottled Perrier. The menu choices are expected, steaks, seafood, etc., but the food is exquisite in both preparation and taste. Best damn $10 martini I have ever had. This is a great place to go for a special occasion, an intimate evening or celebration.

So the front door is actually the back door that goes through the kitchen and gives me anxiety that I will knock a waiter out or piss off the chef for not wearing a hair net.  Once you get into the dining room, it's easier to breathe.  The decor is very Frank Sinatra chic.  Who doesn't love giant rounded leather booths, wood and brocade walls, and chairs whose fabric is attached with the giant nailheads? I had the prime rib, which melted in my mouth.  We also had an amazing strawberry shortcake that I couldn't force enough in my mouth fast enough.

I have to say that I love the fact that your entree comes with sides included instead of having to order everything a la carte, that is annoying. I decided on the  scallops and boy was I happy! There were seven scallops, and they were big ones! They were cooked perfectly- so tender and moist and amazing! I didn't want the meal to end. Someone ordered the halibut, which would have been my second choice and it was a great piece of fish! The steaks looked good as well but I only had eyes for fish on this visit. And potatoes. I had a baked but tasted the roasted garlic mashed and would definitely go with the mashed next time. They were incredible!  Everything about Durant's was amazing: the service, ambiance, food, the feeling. Its definitely a one of a kind establishment that we are lucky to have in Phoenix.",

I get the whole ambiance thing from the old days but it was not for me.  If we are going to pay that high of prices they need to do a lot things better.  You can keep the decor if you want but bring some elegance.  For you of those that have been to Houston's you know a good restaurant.  Houstons is the best balance of all.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu , the atmosphere is wonderful, you can dress how you please, and the prices are not totally crazy.  However, Durants was. The complete opposite.  They had a steak and lobster combo for ......drum roll please.........$189.95.  I got the trout and I could only force myself to eat half.  I asked the waiter if it was breaded and he said no.  That was a lie.  It was breaded and tasteless.  It had absolutely no seasoning or flavor.  A salad comes with your meal but if you want a Cesar salad it will cost you 5 extra dollars.  The lame veggie platter was beyond disappointing.  It also was really strange walking in through the kitchen but whatever.  The only good thing about that is they would be stupid to mess with your food cause they are constantly being watched.  So, 120.00 later me and my husband needed a \"do over\" for dinner.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and will not go back.  If you are reading this and want a good place to eat go to Houston's!",

    "text": "We were here years earlier, shortly after moving to Phoenix to see what it was all about.  Our impression then was so-so, but not worth writing about.  Food was OK, but not good enough to draw us back.   Friday night we attended a birthday for a friend of ours, and while we dine out frequently, including several higher end restaurants (Razz's, Caffe Daniel, Different Point of View and Urban Vine), were a bit taken aback by the steak prices.  My 8 oz. Filet was OK, and thankfully cooked properly at medium rare.  When I requested steak sauce, the server offered A-1 and another major brand of bottled sauce, as well as their own peppercorn sauce.  While I am well aware of rising beef prices - although $55 for an 8 oz. filet seemed on the high side - I was not aware that pepper prices had risen as well.  Sorry, but $4.50 for peppercorn sauce to accompany a $55 steak was outrageous.  It was not any better than the bottled Fresh and Easy brand sauce I use at home.  Other fine steak purveyors in Phoenix provide such accompaniments as part of the entree, which frankly one expects - especially at Durant's prices.  Such nickel and dining of patrons has no place at a fine dining establishment.   Ambience was unchanged from our visit in 2005 - not unpleasant, but quite dated.",

Either way, the situation is long to explain but the way the situation was handled by the server and manager poorly in my opinion. I work at Donovans in Phx, and many things that took place would never happen at lets say, Donovans. I later approached the manager about everything and then he tried to make it up in the end which was fine. Although after i was already frustrated with out food and the communication, then they can not give separate checks , so all 8 of us had to stay and extra 25-30 figuring out who was paying what and he would run all the cards at the same time.... smh, even at chills you can get separate checks in a  large party. I ended up transferring my share of the check to my mother in law so i could GET OUT OF THERE! I'm willing to give it another chance later down the road, but service was OK and food was OK .",

If you like that sort of thing, and good food, you will like this place.   I read that you enter through the kitchen, which we did and it's pretty common. I liked that but so foreign to me at the same time. We had a reservation and were seated right away.  They bring out a little veggie plate with radishes, olives, green onions, carrots and celery. If they had liver pate, I would have really been transported in time! You also get a round of bread with sauteed garlic, leeks, onions and yummy goodness.  Between the 3 of us, a Filet, the Delmonico and Scallops. Everything was great. The steaks were just delicious with perfect seasoning and char. We also had 1 appetizer and drinks all around and 2 deserts. The shrimp cocktail was wonderful, perfectly cooked, HUGE shrimp with nice, zesty cocktail sauce. Honestly though - the beef is the star.  The service was impeccable.  This will not be a regular place for us, more of a special occasion type as it is expensive. It came to just over $100 per person and only one of us got an appetizer. Worth it though to me!",

That was ok but I've had better. My friend had the wedge salad and beautiful large shrimp cocktail. My nephew ordered the raw oysters. These were quite pricey but he enjoyed them. He also got the prime rib and baked potato. He enjoyed that. The wine list was nice. This is a pricey place but good food. The atmosphere is like stepping back into the 1940-50s with the tufted red leather couches. I found it interesting that you walk in the back door and through the kitchen to get into the restaurant. The workers greet you and the maitre'd seats you. We were served a complimentary dessert since it was a birthday of one in our party. An interesting place.",

They start you off with chilled veggies and then some amazing garlic something bread that melts in your mouth. The salad was refreshing and the Prime Rib was probably the best I ever had. No wonder why they have been in business for so long.   Try the crab cakes too!  The day I went was for my best friend's wedding so I was wearing a tuxedo. It was great when I removed my jacket I looked like the staff so I almost started taking tables and orders. Even went over to the staff working on the POS system and said, \"Sorry I'm late, who am I following today for training,\" and one of the servers really did think I was the new guy.   Great, friendly staff, and awesome manager. She made sure everything was perfect with our party and will be back next time I am hanging out in Phoenix.",

Service is great attentive but they allow you your space so you can enjoy your company. Cocktails classic and well made. The food we had oysters Rockefeller amazing, crispy chicken livers great but needed to add some salt no biggie, Caesar salad well executed, prime rib 12oz which must have been closer to 18 oz and a 22 oz bone in rib all the meats where great mashed potatoes good onion rings and the bread it's ridiculous . We finished with cheese cake which was great but the raspberry sauce was a bit over powering , next time we will just get it no sauce. All in all after going to every other steakhouse in Phoenix ie maestros, Dominick's, steak44 and others I find that Durant's tops them all with just the best overall experience.",

Enter via the kitchen to receive a warm welcome from the talented individuals who will soon be preparing your meal.     Invest in the \"Fat Man Special\" at lunch, to split of course.   Look around, and be totally amazed by the sheer number of people having a martini at 11:30am on a Tuesday.  Then join them.    Your dinner will be flawless, your steak prepared more your way than you ever thought it could be.  Should you sit at the bar, make friends with your bartender.  At Durants, they have forgotten more about alcohol than you will ever learn.  Further, should you be lucky enough, you may just be issued a token.  It's unlikely this will happen, but if you do, it's yours to keep, and it will ensure you receive delicious free desert for life.      Frankly, if you can't tell, I love Durant's.  It has a special place in my heart.   My first visit here was for lunch, company treat.  Then I went back for dinner, then again, and again.  There's an ambiance that's almost mythical -- Durant's has been around for 60+ years, and you know where it has its roots as soon as you walk inside.  But even though the decor makes an \"old Phoenix\" statement, nothing feels dated.  It just feels....awesome.   If you're in the market for one of the best steaks of your life, one of the best meals of your life, one of the best dates of your life, or all of the above, give Durant's a try.  You won't regret it.",

Despite our reservations, early arrival time and only one other party in the restaurant, we were seated next to the kitchen door which kept hitting the back of the bench whenever someone came out. Due to the door and kitchen noise, we asked if they could move us but were told no other tables available and the only other option was move to bar.   Bar table was way too small for 4 people to eat comfortably.   To top it off, daughters steak which was ordered medium came out well done, charred and no pink whatsoever.   Pretty disappointed. Can get a better steak for a better price in a more comfortable environment.",

I love going to historic places. But this place needs some updating like needed repairs of cracks/broken items/etc. The carpet is dirty. If they want to charge what they charge I expect the food to be amazing and atmosphere to have a little more effort. This place has really low effort - they just assume since they have been around forever they can get away with crappy service, food, and atmosphere. No thank you!  They also lack vegetarian options which is a huge downside for many people. Not one dinner item is so steer clear of someone on your party needs that.   Our waitress was also snooty, which was annoying. She actually scoffed at me when I asked for a to go container at the end of our meal. I am a high paid attorney - you are a waitress.

    "text": "Must interrupt my catch up on here concurring with the well-deserved accolades Durant's has earned on Yelp and beyond. Arriving just on time for a 9:45 reservation, we waited a few moments as the genial host advised a booth would be our reward. We sat on a comfy bench and took in the sites, sounds, and delicious aroma in the interim.   Patience did indeed reward us with a mid dining room cushy red booth, in Marcelo's section; he and our lovely busser Gai (sp?) were full of genuine smiles, lively banter, expert advice, and shared that they loved their jobs because they were treated so well. It really was all you could want from an evening out.   Their bread is so tasty, and comes slathered in onions, garlic, and leeks, additionally crudite plates with a tasty dip arrived as we perused the menu. We shared a divine shrimp cocktail appetizer which consisted of a glass of four succulent specimens; Mom had a glass of Chardonnay, my dry Belvedere martini up with blue cheese stuffed olives was on point, and Scott enjoyed endless unsweetened iced tea with our meal.   Soup or salad, and choice of potato are included with every meal; we each enjoyed fresh and tasty salad, Mom and Scott both loved their huge baked potatoes; the former with a large portion of chicken Marsala, the latter with the largest prime rib cut they offer. My shrimp Giordano consisted of plump, jumbo shrimp in a garlicky red clam sauce, it was was truly divine, and I took more than half home, I also had a glass of Chianti chosen by Marcelo.   Having read Karen & April's reviews, I was looking forward to the strawberry shortcake, it is a favorite dessert, and their version is truly outstanding: Angel food cake with fresh berries, cream, compote, and dark chocolate shavings tickled my not-too-sweet dessert pickle! We did take half home, and I smashed it at 0330, XD.   Durant's is a classic PHX destination restaurant for a reason, and we will be returning in the future for more memorable meals. We truly felt that everyone wanted us to have an amazing experience here, even as we walked in and out through the busy kitchen, and we did with compliments to all as we left.",

One of the other diners at my table ordered chicken, and the chicken he was served was spoiled.  He took one bite and became physically ill, and was huddled over the toilet the rest of the night.  One of the women dining with us had a steak, which she said was horrid.  My potato was good, and the Creme Brulee for dessert was OK.  We had a nice wine, and service was acceptable.  The fact that this place is so highly rated leads me to believe that the food places in Phoenix are generally not very good.  It was kind of fun walking in through the kitchen, but I don't think that such an experience justifies the terrible food, and I won't be back.",

    "text": "This review is taking into account the price vs quality and experience.   I understand the restaurant has the old style layout and that adds character, but seeing as we had to wait 1.2 hours for our table when they told us it would be 20-25 min. Then they gave our table to someone else. We stood by the bar and drank and was constantly having to move to make way for waiters and other customers moving about the restaurant. It felt like I was in an overcrowded noisy college bar, not a fancy steakhouse.   My second issue was with the menu. I ordered the 8oz fillet mignon because it was one of the smallest portions of meat possible. They need a 6 oz portion. Also, the sides you can get with your steak are limited to Starch, starch, and more starch (baked potato, mashed potato, or french fries). Where are the brussel sprouts, asparagus, Mac and cheese, mixed veggies, etc. you have to order this type stuff as a la carte. Giving me much more than I want. To make matters even worse, they forgot to bring my side of mushrooms out with my food. We also ordered the asparagus and they were sub par. We ordered ray oysters and a few of them had sand grits in them, making them unpleasant to eat. The oyster Rockefeller were really good.   On top of this all, at the end of the meal they just took away my food, didn't even ask if I wanted it boxed to go. I had half a $70 steak left, so they essentially took $35 from me.   Overall this was a $950 meal and I would say the experience wasn't worth $100.",

    "text": "We decided to try Durant's because it was close to our AirBnb in central Phoenix and came highly recommended. So we made reservation for 8pm and arrived quite a bit early. Luckily there was free valet parking.  As we entered the door we walked through the kitchen and all we saw was meat being chopped and felt as if we were walking into somebody's home. We were greeted by the host with such delight! Busy night, we were accommodated even though we arrived early. The server approached our booth within minutes. Took our drink orders and shortly after took our food order. The ambiance is way overrated. Ordered an 8oz filet for $61!! that comes with a mediocre salad and your choice of carb. To be honest you could get a better salad at a drive thru. I had three bites of my salad and they had already brought the steaks!! For my choice of side we had garlic mashed potatoes that tasted like they came from a box. The steak was so lacking in flavor all you could taste was the freezer burn, so bad I wouldn't even dare bring it home to my Doberman. Quickly asked for the check and made our escape. Take your money elsewhere this place is overrated.",

    "text": "Even with the ever changing landscape of Downtown Phoenix, Durant's stands as an iconic rampart to change.  It seems to have eschewed all the conventions of modern restauranteering, to the point that any deviation seems heretical.  After all the years I've been dining here, nothing much has changed in this one story building that exudes the atmosphere of the former Las Vegas stalwarts such as The Dunes, Old Flamingo, Sahara, et al.  You come in the back. Are greeted with dim lighting. And are seated in red-velvet.   In spite all of this, one thing hasn't changed - the fabulous food, and the exemplary service.  We were leaving the Mesa Arts Center at a relatively late hour, and my wife and I were both famished. There are some options for late night dining in the Valley, but even on a Saturday Night, the options diminish past 9 PM.  Neither of us wanted to settle for sub-standard food, but we didn't want to eat a substantial meal this late in the evening. I contacted Durant's just to verify their closing time, and when their kitchen closed.  If an establishment's desire is to shore up as many paying customers as possible for the day, the person answering the phone should be mindful of their tone when questions are posed that could potentially be an inconvenience. In short, don't sound like it's a bother if we are asking what time you are closing. We can easily discern your attitude over the speaker phone, even as we are speeding down the 202!  The gentleman who answered the phone was cheerful and promised us that if we were here before closing time, that the kitchen would be open for us.  As we entered the premises through the rear entrance, which winds through the kitchen; we immediately noticed how welcoming everyone was - sans the eye rolls that we were expecting for arriving near closing time.  No sooner had we stood by the main reception booth, we had no less then 3 people apologize for taking so long to seat us. And at least 2 people proffering to hang my jacket. It made for a great initial experience, since it was us that were inconveniencing them for arriving so late.  Lonnie, our server, seated us in less than two minutes. You could tell that he wasn't a neophyte in his function. He was efficient, friendly, prompt, and his inquisitiveness towards our satisfaction - sincere. Even when he was taking care of other customers, he never missed a glance over at ours to ensure that we taken care of.  Durant's is known for its steaks.   There aren't that many establishments in town that are on equal footing. Steak 44, Mastro's are on par. Maybe Eddie V's, JB's, Orange Sky, El Chorro can potentially be a rival, at times, just to name a few that come to mind.  Such was not our desired course of dining this evening. We ordered a Ceasar's Salad with grilled chicken, and the Chicken Piccata. We also ordered the Shrimp Cocktail as an appetizer.  The Salad was cold and crisp. The chicken grilled just right.   The Sauce on the Chicken Piccata was rich and flavorful. And the accompanying Chicken was prepared in a manner that wasn't undercooked and raw, nor overcooked and hard. The texture and batter was just right.  The shrimp cocktail had an amazing dipping sauce that simply added zest to the large shrimp portions.  Times may change. Downtown landscapes may change. Urban sprawl may cause economic and dining centers to expand.  But, there is no substitute for the time honored masterful preparation of superb cuisine; as well as, the execution of professional and cordial service.  Durant's has both in great abundance!",

The meal started with some crudites and bread. They were both unique options. We started out with the calamari and the Kobe sliders. The calamari was fresh and tender and the marinara sauce was delicious. The Kobe sliders were served on a pretzel bun and they were pretty good, probably wouldn't order them again though. I got the bone in ribeye as my entree with mashed potatoes. Their soup of the night was a shrimp bisque and I ordered that. The soup was creamy and rich and it was filled with small pieces of shrimp. The ribeye was fantastic. Cooked perfectly and was very juicy and tender. The mashed potatoes were decent. Finished the meal with their famous strawberry shortcake which I don't really get the hype about. It could have been because I just got done eating 20 oz of steak but I really didn't care too much for the dessert. Cappuccino was just okay as well. This place is obviously known for their steak so that was the highlight of the meal. Great service and very cool old school atmosphere. Not sure how soon I will return but it's definitely worth checking out.",

We pull up and she asked if it was a strip club. Small, unsuspecting joint. We get in and the ambiance is real - red lighting and vintage vinyl-style seating. Felt straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. I knew we were in the right place. It was a busy night, but we were seated right away. Service was phenomenal - always attentive and super down to earth. Great people. And, let's not forget the main courses - delish. I got a 6 oz. filet mignon. Mom got the prime rib. We polished it off with a white raspberry cheesecake that could've put Cheesecake Factory out of business. All around great meal, great place. 10/10 would go again.",

So much so, that after deciding to marry a bf of 12 years I couldn't think of any other place I'd rather have dinner afterwards!  As my dinner for 18 swelled into 30 and after multiple calls of shame asking for more seats, I was touched when Durant's went from a business that wasn't sure about being able to satisfy such a large group to a committed partner in making it all a great night to remember.  I'm a fan for life, and we'll definitely be back for our anniversary dinners!",

The cauliflower soup is to die for & the basil, olive oil, butter, bread is super scrumptious. The raw oysters were also surprisingly fresh & delectable.  They are also known for their martinis which they did not fail to impress with their dirty martini. The old fashion was mediocre.  Nevertheless, the bartender sure knows his desserts!!  The key lime pie was out of this world!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!",

The overall treatment made me feel less than welcome, little did they know I was prepared to indulge myself with a great deal of seafood and drinks.  Too bad for them, we ended up leaving after we had literally no attention at all from anyone.  For those prices, they should be worshipping you as a customer from start to finish.  Couldn't even get a reasonable \"hello\" from anyone.  My suggestion, stay away.  Donovan's on camelback is a much better option.  Go there, they will treat you like royalty instead of trash.",

The lighting is dark, the wall paper is red velvet, and the entrance is through the kitchen.  Marvelous.  The food and drinks weren't bad either!  I had one cosmo that put me at just the right \"level,\" which I'm not sure if that says more about Durant's or my ability to handle alcohol.  In any case, the drinks were great.  I also had a New York strip, which was cooked at a perfect medium as ordered.    To sum it all up, the mood of Durant's prompted my boyfriend to propose to me at the end of the night.  Can you say romance?",

They greeted us with \"two?\" And after we said yes, they again asked, \"for dinner?\" Well of course for dinner..After my boyfriend's first comment I started to second guess what else they might offer.     Literally the only cool thing about this place was the kitchen entry. However, upon entering we apologized because we thought we went through the wrong door. Apologizing for entering the restaurant. Weird.     It was our anniversary on a Sunday night. We were there, as well as two other tables. We didnt make it a point to tell the waitress of our occasion,  but she didnt ask either. We exchanged cards with eachother near the end of the evening. Our waitress seemed to not care as much about us, as she did the older folk that were seated next to us.     The steaks were decent. I have had better elsewhere for half of the cost. Please upgrade your cutlery. I have seen sharper knives at a dive bar. I got a workout while trying to cut my steak. Extremely frustrating and killed my mood. I was unimpressed with the Delmonico. Skip it..no flavor. Waitress did not come back to see if our steaks cooked properly (although the were to temperature.)     Ive read in some reviews that the decor is old school, mobster-like. Well I wish I had read that before I went, because I did not get that vibe at all. I got the vibe of a cheap, old place in desperate need of rennovation.     Extremely dissapointed in every aspect of this place. If I had known how to properly exit, I wouldve left before ordering. (Although I guess the kitchen was the main exit, just awkward not knowing as a first time guest)    This experience was so lousy, that we decided to do a \"re-date\" to celebrate our anniversary",

My one word of caution would be to be careful of going with too many people. 2-4 is fine.

We did try some bread that looked amazing, even though we were full. Couldn't help myself as bread is a weakness of mine. Ciabatta loaf with a sauce poured over it of butter, leeks, shallot, garlic and basil. To die for. Their wine list is incredible, screaming eagle and sine non qua. Awesome.

He said \"pick a nice place\" and, of course, I chose Durant's! Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the \"I wanna put you in my pocket\" line.   See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was \"Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!\" We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated. Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!   One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap. The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient! The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty. The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.   We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream. The best touch, though, was the ambience.  Oh, and members of \"the Family\" at the table right next to us.  Ah, to hear that Queens accent again!   Definitely my top high-end restaurant in the Valley now!  I'll be back!  Not with the BIL, though.  I'll bring one of my boys.",

And at $30 an entree I expect my food to be served without a side of attitude.  The service wasn't bad, it was offensive.  Our server was rude, sarcastic, flippant, and completely disrespectful. My husband actually got up halfway through the dinner to pull him aside and alert him that we were not happy with the service and to give him a chance to step it up.  We were quite polite and discrete about it.  The server proceeded to come back to the table and make jokes about this and announced sarcastically to the table that \"he heard we were in a rush to get somewhere\" and he was going to speed things up.  Um.  Wrong.  We weren't in a rush.  All we wanted was to enjoy our dinner.  It was bad enough I brought my parents to this place.  But I would have been truly mortified if I had brought a client here.  I will never go back.    If you have read my reviews, you know I am not prone to writing harsh reviews unless it is totally deserved. This one is.  Durants seems to be one of those old school restaurants that is skating by on its history and once-deserved reputation.  My advice?  Don't bother.  I can think of at least 5 other steak houses in the Valley where you will get a better meal for about the same or less money with far better service.  Lets review:  expensive mediocre food, horrible service, loud chaotic atmosphere...  really?  Your still going to give it a try?  Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.",

    "text": "Having lived in Phoenix for over 13 years now, I am well acquainted with Durant's. It is not possible to live here without being told about the place, so unique is it in the land of strip malls and chain-fueled palates. Everything you've heard about the place is True - inside it is a temple to the masculine Hollywood of yesteryear, replete in red velvet and leather. I remember my first experience with the place all those years ago and if my memory serves me correctly, you could expect top-notch food and top-notch service for your top-notch bill.  Not anymore. Durant's has clearly become so enamored with itself that it is of the opinion that it is the destination alone that you will drop a Benjamin per person to experience, and the quality of the food and waitstaff are afterthoughts, annoyances. Their appetizers and sides are criminally paltry, but you won't care because they're terrible. Dry, flavorless, uninspiring. Except the crab cakes, drat it - they're still good - so good that after I ate my forkful-sized portion I was in such bliss that I didn't even think about the fact that that bite and my companion's bite cost me twenty bucks. Their steaks are prime cuts made well, but then again, they ought to be, no?   The real kicker here though is the service. When I'm laying down the kind of smack that Durant's commands, I hold my waiter to a higher standard. The tips are (or could reasonably be expected to be) exponentially higher than average, therefore they should have fewer tables and be far more attentive than average. I'm a very easy guy to get along with and I tip well, so it's not like I'm expecting a backrub or anything, but in both of the last two trips I have taken here, my order has been incomplete or flat-out wrong. In both the last two trips I have gone for ten or more minutes trying to even FIND my waiter, much less ask them for something, and when I did find them, their attitude was absolutely flip if not downright rude. I chalk it up to the casual attire I had on because everything about the waitstaff's behavior indicates that they engage in wealth profiling. In a place where a bad tip has to be somewhere around twenty or thirty bucks, you wouldn't think it would matter. Not so much.  Sorry to have to say it, but I won't be back. I give it two stars for what it used to be.",

    "text": "i had no idea durant's was so cool baby when i decided i had to go there. here's the story.  in my last semester of college i did a huge invetigative thing on don bolles (the reporter who was murdered here in '76). anyway, when interviewing all the old school reporters who were tailing the mob back then, the name Durant's came up every time. most of the hotels, restaurants, coffee shops they talked about for insider tips and secret rendevous didn't exist anymore, but this one did. so i thought how cool it would be to see this part of az history.  two years later i finally made it (god, i've been out of college two years? whew). it was nothing like i expected from the seedy stories i was told that went on here 30 years ago.  first, the entrance through the kitchen kind of rocks - it's hotter in there than it was outside in august, the chefs look annnoyed and it feels awkward, but  damnit where else can they charge nearly $20 for a caesar salad and make you walk through a hot ass kitchen to do it?  i had heard the martinis were the bee's knees here, so i ordered one, with vodka, dirty. i'm not just saying this - i was ready to have to defend my love of this place despite their overpriced whatever because i had decided two years ago this place was awesome - that was one damn.good.martini. not too dirty,  not too strong, BIG and about $10 (happy hour price). i almost didn't get it because i was hot and thirsty and dirty martini didn't sound refreshing, but it was somehow still delicious.  i only made it to the lounge, which is probably where i'll spend most of my future visits. long bar, great plush, vintage decor, wonderful service. the server was unpretentious, friendly, chatty and professional, right down to how he offered their dessert options. you know how most servers disinterestedly prattle off \"double chocolate lava cake, ooey-gooey caramel cheesecake\" ? not this guy, he sincerely offered up some of the most delicious concoctions as though he handmade each one as his chosen form of artistic expression.  this place is a time warp. it' still dominantly male business crowd, but i didn't let the polos, silver hair and understated expensive shoes and watches kill my mood (it was tuesday at 5:30, what can you expect?). plus it's on central, and i feel it's my duty to go uot of my way to support biz's stuck in the light rail construction mess.",

It's like entering a different world.  It's just so cozy, with those low lights and plush red velvet.

My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Morton's and Mastro's) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durant's had great reviews.  When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then you're greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere. Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.",

Don't miss the \"debris\" as an app, delightful little skewers of grilled beef and veggies (they make a perfect lunch as well).

What makes this interesting is you have to know that when we go to steak restaurants with each other we order the biggest piece of meat on the menu.  Usually that isn't a problem but at Durant's the biggest steak is a 48 oz porterhouse.  We looked at each other and knew we were in trouble.  Luckily you can order it for 2 but that is still 24 oz a piece.  Also, whatever is on their bread is amazing I can never tell because it is so dimly light in the place.  But it is delicious.  Even more sweet is that they have servers walking around filling your glasses with Evian water.  The piece de resistance is when the steak came out and we were in awe.  It was freaking great.  The best steak I have ever had.  I also had a several chocolate martinis and as the other reviews state they were strong.  I was so blitzed at the end of the night I don't even remember if we finished the steak.  I know we ordered dessert because I found it in my fridge later in the night.  I love that you can walk on the red carpet through the kitchen into the restaurant.  Can you say Goodfellas?  Although no one brought us our own table.  The red velvet walls and the dim lighting make it a very relaxing environment and I love the booths.  This is the best of Phoenix history. What else can I say!!!",

    "text": "So, I visited Durant's after viewing the menu online and reading some reviews.  The place is old school, which I love, and looks as if it hasn't changed much in 50 years.  Again...totally cool, and if you like the retro, Sinatra, Goodfellas vibe, this place has it.  The service was great, no complaints.  I ordered an 8 oz filet (medium), an 8 oz cold water lobster tail (surf and turf), a side of mushrooms, a piece of cheesecake with strawberries, and a coffee.  Bread and some pickled veggies come with dinner, and the entree came with a cup of soup and a starch.    Everything was cooked nicely and presented nicely, nothing to write home about, but it was all done as you'd expect.  The steak was a little more \"bullseyed\" than I'd like...the outer \"well-done\" ring of meat was a bit thicker than I'd expect for a medium steak, but it was OK.  Had I done it again, based on how they cook their meat, medium rare would have likely been ideal.    Now, the part that garners one star.  My total bill, with a 20% tip, was $185.  This was for one person, the meal I listed above.  The surf and turf was $118, if I recall.  The prices for the steak and seafood entrees were absolutely nothing short of highway robbery, in my opinion.  I've dined at many steakhouses, chains and smaller ones, and the prices at this one were so far out of line that I'd say they are probably 1.5x to 1.8x what they should have been.  Furthermore, the prices are NOT on the menu posted on the \"menu\" section of their website.  Had they been, I never would have gone there.  I checked other establishments, and the prices posted for Phoenix steakhouses were on par with what I'd expect just about anywhere.  I'm from Philadelphia.  For a comparison, in a top Philly steakhouse, and I mean one of the top rated in the city based on things like Yelp and Zagat, you can get a THREE POUND butter poached lobster, plus an 8oz filet for what I paid for an 8oz tail, and 8oz filet.  The prices are just unbelievable, and again, this is from someone that dines out often.  That, combined with the fact they don't post their prices online, is why the one-star rating.    So, if you're willing to pay for a retro kind of place, and I mean PAY through the nose, by all means.  Otherwise, there are plenty of other steakhouses in Phoenix with perfectly acceptable pricing that would be just as good, if not better.  These people should be ashamed of themselves.  Had it not been 9:30pm, I absolutely would have walked out and gone elsewhere, but having no car and no other reservations on a Saturday night, I had to suck it up and deal.  They got me this time, but never again.    -J",

And, patrons (donning fedoras and suits) enter their favorite place for a bloody steak/Martini through the kitchen?  Durant's has this. I promise. I feel like an O.G. when I eat here, due to the aging, red seats and dimmed red \"mood lights\". It really makes me feel like always having my back faced to the wall, as if a thug would bust through the doors and cap my azz! It has a dramatic vibe and I adore places with such personality.  I haven't visited in awhile, but they do serve up a very good Crab Louie/Shrimp Salad (generous amounts of seafood).  Hmmm... perhaps I'll suggest lunch here w/my friend on Saturday?!",

Just have to b careful if you come during the weekends because I heard it gets really packed! The waiter checked on us pretty frequently and made sure that our party was good.   I ordered the bone in rib eye which was extremely delicious and cutting the steak was like cutting butter. Mashed potatoes is a must! Just when I thought the experience couldn't have been any better, I decided to order the strawberry shortcake for dessert and it was the perfect follow up after enjoying a nice steak. Even when I was full, I wanted to keep going and eat my entire dessert because of how good it tasted! Overall Durant's is one of the best steakhouses in the valley!",

And when you enter through the kitchen at 8:30pm on a Saturday night, it's no reality show. It's a busy, functioning restaurant. I try to slow-walk as best I can.   After that, not so much. It's so old-school there's ice in the urinals. You're not gonna find that in many places.   To me the food is very average and priced at the top of the line. My 12 oz filet was quite good. No extra charge for the red-flock wall paper but I kept wondering what my steak would have tasted like at Steak 44, Donavan's m, you know.   In other words, you're paying as much is anywhere in town and what you getting for it is an old-school steak. You go. I'm done.   Except for the entrance.   8/10/2019 -- the guy sitting next to me at the bar was 93 years old. He told me. Couldn't hear a thing. But he offered up him s age and that \"our\"bartender was \"Bartender of the Year\". Hmmmm...  I question this because she took over 5 minutes to greet me. Well, to be honest, she never greeted me; she only \"greeted\" me because I put my hand up to order a drink. Perhaps the bartender of the year might want to greet people more quickly than that...for a $14 martini...  And here's the thing: I know she's got responsibilities, I know she's just working a job trying to keep food on the table and a roof over her head, but she's in the HOSPITALITY BUSINESS!  By not being hospitable, she's really just there to collect a paycheck. As a bartender, you can't be that obvious.   I don't mind contributing to her fund but the first order of business is hospitality!! Say hi!!  Be friendly! \"I'll be right with you!\" CAN last a lot longer than five minutes  Listen, I suspect there's DNA stuffed in the red flock wallpaper from the Eisenhower administration. You go there. I'm done.",

However, once you walk into the restaurant, you are completely transformed.  From the parking lot entrance, you enter the restaurant through the kitchen which is both a little weird but also a very cool concept. The entire restaurant is sleek and sexy with a red room vibe.   Now can we talk about their specialty bread?!? OMG that bread.. it was garlic, chives, butter and I can't remember what else but it was HELLA delish. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with garlic mashed potatoes. The chicken Marsala had to be the thickest Chicken Marsala I have ever had but it was so juicy and flavorful.   My boyfriend ordered one of the steaks with the baked potato. He definitely enjoyed the cut and said it was perfect. We finished the evening with a Homemade Key Lime Pie.  I highly recommend this place for a sexy date night out.",

    "text": "In the words of Jack Durant , ' In my humble opinion, Durant's is the finest eating and drinking establishment in the world'. It definitely is in Phoenix in MY not -so-humble opinion! When there is something to celebrate in my world, I always turn to Durant's. Things in food don't have to be overly done, they have to be good, here they are superb. When you enter the iconic restaurant that has been housed on Central Avenue for decades through the kitchen back door , you are greeted warmly and the cleanliness of the kitchen stand outs. The bar is fantastic; we generally come before our reservation to enjoy something at the bar. We have seen the same bartenders for years and they are always great. The maitre de always checks with us to ask if we are ready to be seated. We always make a reservation so we can have a booth. The steaks here are just superb. The last time my husband and I shared the Porterhouse and two Lobster Tails! Such a treat . We started with sharing the Shrimp Cocktail, which is huge and has the most amazing cocktail sauce I've ever tasted. We also love sharing the Wedge Salad, this time we did not, as the entree we were about to partake in was going to be A LOT! The Porterhouse is served thinly sliced : filet on one side and NY Strip on the other, even for two sharing, we have yet to finish this steak when we have ordered it. You can have sauces brought , as well. But, this steak, as all Durant's steaks , need no sauce.. they are just pure perfection. The bread that you begin with is amazing too; that oil and garlicky leek! Mmmmm! I usually try to not fill up on this and save room for my meal. Entrees here are old school , in that they are served with the soup or the great house or caesar salad , a side , ( there are many!) , and veggies of the day. The wine list is out of this world .. so are the martinis. Now if you happen to be a very lucky person, you have one of the rare , famed 'lifetime' Durant's tokens in your possession. We have been lucky enough to have dined here when the celebratory tokens were passed out on a few occasions. If you have one , you know .. ;)  \"Good Food, Great Steaks, and The Best Booze are the necessities of life!\" , according to the humble philosophy of the great Jack Durant.. I happen to agree that they are three! Keeping it simple on food and fancy with flare while providing perfect service , steaks , seafood and drinks make this a perfect place for me. Next time you sip that great martini in the iconic bar .. cling your glass and tip the man : 'Hey Jack!' You can almost hear these walls beckon his name !",

    "text": "Wow... this restaurant has to be in my top 3 of all time. Old school feel, but so classy at the same time. Enter thru the kitchen in the back and say hello to the wonderful chefs. Every time I've been here I spend about 3 hours here. I love the crudites platter, a nice touch. Their leek bread is out of this world. I've had the filet, ribeye, all been wonderful every time. Perfectly seasoned steaks. Desserts are great as well, strawberry shortcake is worth the try. Don't even get me started on their drinks! Durant's makes a STIFF drink I can only have 2 at the most and then I'm good for the night! I can't say enough about the quality and vibe this restaurant has, it really is the best.",

Durant's is one of those epic dining experiences.  Durant's is lush! From the red walls to the red seating, you feel as if you have stepped back into time and just know this is going to experience and having been during the holidays with the lights and decorations all around just gave it more of special touch.  I was absolutely tickled pink when a small dish of crudite to nosh on was brought to table. It had carrots, green onions, olives and celery served with ice, and is totally something my grandmother use to present before meals. Loved it! Also brought to the table was some of the best tasting bread, it was a bowl loaf cut up and covered in garlic, artichoke and olive oil! So good!   I have been craving prime rib for a while so after checking out the menu I went with the 8-ounce prime rib with baked potato and salad. Even though it was a normal side salad, it too was fancy, it was fresh and crisp and for the dressing I ordered Roquefort dressing, simply the best!  The prime rib was perfect, the outside was crispy, the inside medium rare and juicy! The au jus was amazing too, but honestly not really needed, the prime rib on its own was outstanding. Even the baked potato was divine! This was an amazing meal!  I also tried the strawberry shortcake, and this put all other strawberry shortcakes to shame! It was light, fluffy and decadent. So dreamy!   Service was impeccable, everything about this dining experience was excellent. This is the place to go if you are wanting to impress your audience.  Amazing company, superb service and fabulous meal. Cannot wait to go back!",

I will always love Durant's, but it is not the place I once knew. This is not a review to discourage you, it is simply the development of a foregone standard. The food will not disappoint you and the cocktails will carry on strong, but the reverence has dwindled a bit.",

    "text": "First time at Durant's celebrating a birthday.  Funny that the entrance is through the kitchen and yet one gets a great welcome from a management person and workers.  Despite being 15 minutes early, we were accommodated in a great semi-circular booth--red of course-- to go along with the red wallpaper and red flocking.  Really old school reminiscent of the saloon decor in westerns.  The bar was packed so there has to be a really good happy hour deal going on.  The place is dim so you better have a small flashlight to read the menu.  We had a bloody mary which was nice and strong just as we like it.  They gave us a small tray with chilled veggies and a dipping sauce. So fresh!  The entrees come with soup or salad and a potato side in various forms (garlic mashed, fried, baked and sweet potato fries).   We chose salads which were mixed greens with tomatoes--Again very fresh.  Instead of dressing we asked for extra virgin olive oil.  We were given very high quality olive oil which made the salads really delicious.      We ordered a ribeye with sweet potatoes and the cajun pork chop.  Unfortunately the ribeye was not rare enough and we sent it back.  They graciously gave us another ribeye which was cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.  The pork chop was very charred on the outside yet perfectly pink and juicy on the inside.  Beautifully prepared.  I mustn't forget to mention the complementary garlic bread.  A ciabatta round sitting in a dish with oil and lots of garlic.  My husband loved it.  They treated us to a delicious chocolate ganache cake which was amazing candle and all.   Dave was our server and could not have done anything more to make our experience better.  He was an attentive, friendly and respectful server.  We will definitely be asking for Dave when we return to Durant's.",

I also ordered the Chocolate Indulgence Cake. Both were good.  My server was excellent, kind, and very patient.   The bartender was talking about the stock market with a customer. And the customer at the bar talked about their outrageous purchases, $1,500 - $30,000 priced items. It was interesting. Reminded me of being in the Financial District in NYC. But their steakhouses are not as romantic as Durant's. Definitely bring a date here asap!",

People were coming in with shorts, flip-flops & raggedy tshirts. All of our meals came at room temperature. Not even close to warm. Just pitiful. And, we spent $$$$$$.

I found it and since Durant's has been in business since 1950  and still family owned I was excited for the drive and experience.  You enter in the main doors through the kitchen. Found a seat at the bar thankfully. It's dark, dim and red and wood decor but puts you back in the day. Bar was packed found a seat and the bartender was not happy or maybe a bad night.  Ordered the shrimp cocktail was delish....bartender was still not friendly.  Figured it was part of the ambience. Ordered a ribeye and mushrooms they were to die for. It came with a salad and veggies. Got the wedge was told it was a la cart ok....was told it came with 2 sides...ordered broccoli was told that was a la cart ok....it's what I wanted  Steak came it was amazing the mushrooms fabulous! No broccoli and a side of house mashed potatoes. I would have gotten a baked potato if I had ever ordered potatoes.  Food was amazing service not so much but figured it was part of the bar experience.  Steve was nicer at the end but why not giving 5 stars.",

For some reason beef was off limits, although I'm not sure why but I do have a theory.  I think it's because God never had one of Durant's boneless ribeyes cooked Pittsburgh style with a side of atomic horseradish, pre-dinner crudites served with roquefort dressing, and a nice garden salad with a baked potato. Had he done so, I'm pretty sure Catholics would have never had that silly rule about not eating meat on Fridays.   I'm guessing someone back in the day, probably Abraham, did sacrifice a cow to God at one point, but because Abraham was Jewish and didn't know how to make anything other than reservations, he grilled and served up one bad cut of beef to God. The result? God punishes Catholics and Hindus. Go figure.   Durant's won't punish you. Not like Abraham anyway.",

My wife loved her shrimp cocktail and had a ham and brie with apple sandwich which was not too big. The brownie pie completed her meal. Friends had crab cakes as a meal and his spouse had pulled pork sandwich special plus shrimp cocktail.  Somehow our Pre-tip lunch cost $65 per person but we felt it was worth it.",

    "text": "It was my birthday recently and my wife and I wanted to head out for some good old fashioned steakhouse meat! Meat served in what seems to be a set straight out of Madmen.  It is the quintessential steakhouse: windowless, velvety, leathery, a little musty, a bit smokey, a touch corny, and everything I ever want in a House of Meat.  Dinner began with delectable cocktails: for madame a Kir Royale, for monsieur a HUGE Manhattan. Lovely. We shared a 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell with tangy house-made cocktail sauce. On to satisfying yet run-of-the-mill Caesar salads. Nothing new here, just chopped romaine, perfect dressing grated parm and anchovies. I prefer a whole-leaf experience with crispy capers and shaved cheese. But all around a good salad. She had a gorgeous 8oz fillet done perfectly med-rare. She got garlic mashed potatoes. I had a 14oz T-Bone that was also grilled med-rare to perfection. I also like them bloody: as in \"If we got it to a vet it might have a chance!\" But this day was a brown and pink day and what a joy it was. I had a baked potato that was  peeled and wonderfully crispy on the outside. We shared sauteed broccolini. Both steaks melted in the mouth and were delicately and perfectly seasoned. I cleaned the T-bone fully, disregarding cutlery at the end to mad-dog it into submitting all parts flesh. This feast was paired with a nice bottle of mid-priced red. The restaurant brought us a complimentary slice of cake as it was the 21st anniversary of my 21st birthday. I don't eat dessert, but my wife enjoyed a few bites. I don't actually recall what it was. I think it was kind of golden in color.  This is the type of place one chooses for special occasions or important business dealings. I wouldn't say date place as it's quite busy and a little brightly lit. Though for date night with a spouse who also loves kitschy steakhouses it's perfect! It was pricey. It was worth it. I lived 2 blocks from this place for a year and gazed longingly at the pink edifice in which it is housed every time I drove by, wondering what delights lay within. Now I know, and so should you. Durants, we shall do the meat dance with you again some day...thank you.",

French onion soup was ok. I think the sweet potatoe fries were the same the I buy from the frozen foods section.

We were both pleased with the service we got with our meals that included a couple glasses of dry white wine, filet mignon and a large rib-eye. The total came to a bit over $100, but the portions were generous and to see my mom enjoy her dinner experience this much was totally worth it! The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because some of the tipsy and loud folks spilled out from the front bar to the dining area and detracted from our dining experience somewhat. Their gorgeous bar area nicely accommodates drinking revelry for those interested in that.",

The female bartender who is always there has no personality and is about as customer service oriented as an old shoe.

The story goes on with forgot drink orders, and the delivery of desert to those of us having the prix fix menu, and the rest had to ask for a menu, and again he was surprised.  So he said \"dessert    Is on me\".  You guessed it, desserts were charge on the bill, as was a salad price doubled .  This was the second try with the same results in 2011.  So YES it is a land mark, and YES it is red walls and old school cool, but.... Food is OK, and service keeps disappointing ..... For the price, I will go elsewhere.",

We each ordered different plates and sampled from each other's. I had the prime rib rare with baked potato.

I like the very dated velvety dark steak house decor.  \"It smells like coffee in here.\"  My son announced.  Almost like stepping into a timewarp when cigar smoking was allowed.  I decided to order Manhattan Clam Chowder,  Crab Cakes ($36) with chipotle aioli and a side of fries I shared with my cutie pie.  I've had crab cakes that are mostly bread crumbs with crab flavoring...well this one is all lump crab meat lightly breaded and pan fried.  Two six ounce cakes, one for me and the other for the little monster seafood eater.  Fries were thin and crispy, just the way we like it.  I still prefer New England Chowda with fresh clams thrown in at the very end.  This soup had chewy canned clams.  My hubby ordered the 12oz Prime Rib ($29), a side of baked potato and house salad.  When it came out, it looked like one full pounder!  Man, did that look good.  I begged for a bite of that juicy piece of meat!  Sooo good!  He couldn't finish the whole thing.  Even with a small bite, that was the best prime rib I've ever had!  FIL decided on a ginger glazed Salmon ($30) with a side of mashed potatoes and house salad.  If we had known, we would've taken him to a seafood restaurant instead of a steak house.    Thank goodness he was happy with his meal.  We had to take the complimentary dessert (chocolate  decadence) home.  We were stuffed!  We will definitely be back for more!",

Everything seemed to move in slow motion. Ran out of my beverage before she showed up again to bring a refill. I don't like that either. Server was not bad, just not great. And, at the premium prices, I expect better. I had the 8 oz. filet and scallops ($70) and my wife had the scallops ($42) and a margarita ($10). Food was cooked as ordered and to perfection. I did notice the pre-dinner bread with oil, cheese and kale as well as our Portuguese sausage & potato soup were both on the salty side. Total bill with an overly generous tip was $160.

Bread: The leek olive oil soaked bread is amazing. I dream of it.  Steaks: I have had their ribeye and prime rib. Both cooked perfectly. Both amazing in cut and flavor. Is this some USDA Prime dry aged marbled beast? Not sure. But that charcoal mesquite fire grill makes these steaks mighty darn tasty.   Dessert: Pretty solid. Basic usual suspects. Cheesecake, Ice Cream, Pie, Brownie.   Atmosphere: Durants has it in droves. Its like that scene in Goodfellas where everyone says hi to Ray Liotas character.

I had the 18oz ribeye, and it was delicious and perfectly cooked (Pittsburgh style - charred on outside and rare inside). My girlfriend had the scallops which were also excellent.  The wine list is reasonably priced and extensive. The martinis are awesome.  I've been to many high end steak houses, and Durant's is as good as it gets.",

    "text": "Without a doubt, good stuff!  The ambiance is just about universally appealing: dim, lush, old school class, and fun in a back-to-the-future-but-not-campy kinda way.  I sat at the bar, so I can't comment on the table service, but the sheer number of staff walking around leads me to believe it'd be on-point.  I was in the mood for steak and steak is what I got:  perfectly cooked to temperature, classically seasoned, and most importantly, well rested.  The only word of caution here is that if you intend to dine here, not take home leftovers, and finish your meal, the portions served could be devastating to any plans afterwards.  I ordered the 18oz ribeye, and it had minimal gristle:  add in the salad, a side, whatever you're drinking, and you are potentially facing a full 2 pounds of food in your stomach.  That's borderline competitive eating, and it might make you reach for the couch in a desperate attempt to take a nap.  Next time, I'll definitely be getting a surf & turf so I can have room to try the seafood since there seems to be a lot of great stuff to try here besides choking down a steak of flinstonian proportions.  All in all, very satisfied ... even as I write this review from my couch.",

    "text": "Durant's is a classy, old-style, American steakhouse.  We have been going there for 10+ years and have only been disappointed once.  We were not served the amazing bread with garlic butter and leeks - just rolls.  The waiter dropped a shrimp from my shrimp cocktail on the table and picked it up and stuck it back with his bare hands.  Then when we received our dinner we noted a rosemary sprig stuck into the mashed potatoes.  That never happened before.  Not a big deal, but we have never been big on foofy presentation and Durant's has never been like that.  Just really excellent service, cocktails and amazingly good food!  We stayed away for a while as it is a pretty good hike from home and didn't want to be disappointed again - after all, it's a really expensive place but worth it when you have NEVER, I mean never ever, been disappointed before.   To make a long story short, we had heard so many people had complained, they brought the bread back.  We decided to try it again a few months ago and again last night.  We have only ordered drinks and appetizers, so we don't know if they still stick rosemary sprigs in the mashed potatoes.  Last night we sat at the bar and the service was amazing!  We ordered Stoli martinis and there was absolutely no scrimping on the vodka.  I couldn't finish mine as it was a too much for me, but we certainly got a big bang for our buck!  We both got the Ceasar salad and I had the shrimp cocktail - huge tender shrimp in cocktail sauce with a dollop of sinus blasting horseradish just like I like it.  My husband had the Durant's Debris - perfectly cooked cubes of steak served with a very flavorful dipping sauce.  Durant's is again our favorite special-occasion restaurant!",

The baked potato and said salad were pretty good.  Our waiter was attentive, but he didn't ask us how are meals tasted or inquire as to why I took two bites of my meal.  I probably wouldn't have complained, but I found it odd he didn't even ask.  I liked the ambiance quite a bit. It was interesting...very old school.",

When I first walked in, I wasn't sure where we were supposed to go.  There was no hostess stand when you 1st walked in so I just asked a waitress that was near by.  The place has a mafia feel to it.  My boyfriend felt like he was in downtown Chicago and I felt like I was in NYC.  The service was decent, although the waiter seemed to have paid more attention to me in the beginning than my boyfriend, which is a pet peeve our ours.  But during the meal, the attention was equal.  The food itself was very good.  The restaurant was pretty clean although it is a tad outdated.  A HUGE thumbs down and a VERY unattractive thing about this place is that there was a prostitute sitting near us, at the bar with 2 older gentlemen.  This place is pretty pricey and it was a huge let down to see this.  There was no mistake it was definitely a prostitute as she was only wearing a bright satin bra on, very short, jean shorts with some kind of lightweight shirt on, completely unbuttoned hence the bra sticking out.  This was unacceptable and a big reason we will never go back and I will not recommend this place.  She should have not been allowed in.  Plus, there should be a better dress code enforced.",

Not only did our server know everything and make great recommendations (as he should), the bartender Gayle was phenomenal. We ordered 9 semi-complicated drinks while asking her menu questions and she responded to everything thoroughly while making all of our drinks to the tee. My dad is a diabetic and felt dizzy while we waited for the table (maybe because he ordered a dirty Grey Goose martini which looked like 5 shots of vodka in a glass) and Gayle made sure to bring him orange juice and a few cheese/sausage chunks to spike his blood sugar.   I liked that we were not rushed through our dinner. There was no set time to order anything and I appreciate that. My only complaint was the shrimp on my Cesar salad was cold, although deliciously seasoned. Desserts are homemade and you cannot beat the atmosphere of an old fashioned steak house.   Definitely recommend making reservations and using the valet so you can walk through the kitchen on your way in and out.",

They stir instead of shaking the martinis AND have my favorite vodka, Tito's. Gayle is just a delight every time I go in. I've also made a few friends hanging out there. OH and the ambiance!

Pleasant company made for a pleasant evening.    My companions wereecstatic about their Filet.  We all LOVED the sauteed mushrooms.   I never had better 'shrooms.  DURANT'S is a throwback to that scene from the movie \"GOODFELLOWS\".   ( I have never ) Entering through the bustle of restaurant- the customer finds bright red velvet walls surrounded by dark woods.   The other customers in DURANTS showed signs of well lubricated dinning-it made for a happy visit to DURANT'S.",

    "text": "So..... yeah.... this happened  As you can tell by the price rating on Durant's, this is not a cheap restaurant.  It is one of the most expensive dinners I've had while in Phoenix.  So when I'm going to dine at a restaurant when my bill will be $100+ I expect excellent service, close to military type precision, and Durant's doesn't have it.  Overall Service: Our waiters were sporadic when checking in on us, there were several times when we had to catch anyone just to tell them to get our waiter because we wanted either a new drink or to even order our dinner.  The our table wasn't even cleared enough either!  Empty plates and glasses were just left on our table, making it crowded after a while.  It became a running joke with my friends how bad the service was.  Such a shame.  Bread Service: There was a small round of bread that was actually really yummy with spinach, onions and olive oil.  Not enough though, and wasn't refilled to the table till the end of the meal (yeah exactly).  Also we were served a small plate of some random veggies with a ranch dipping sauce.  The presentation could have been better.    Drinks: When we ordered wine, the serving experience was special... The wine glasses and flights (both empty) were delivered first and then eventually the waiter brought the bottles of wine to pour into our flights, then pour wine from the flight into our glasses.  The staff really needs to be retrained on how to serve wine...  Wine was split while pouring my flight and i had to ask for a new napkin since mine was soaked in wine.  Mid-point into the dinner we got tired of waiting for the servers so we just went to the bar to get our drinks.  Appetizers:  We got the calamari, chicken livers, and crab cake.  The calamari, the cheapest appetizer at $10 was fine, nothing special.  Chicken livers were dry and with no dipping sauce.  Crab cake was my favorite and I would order this again if I ever find myself back here, for some unknown reason.  Dinner: The stakes were good.  Didn't really rock my world considering the price, but they were good.  They come with a salad and a starch side.  For the salad, make sure to ask for the dressing on the side, my friend's salads were drenched.  The prices ranged from $30 (8 oz prime rib) - $200 for the steak dinners (that cut came with two lobster tails), fyi.  Dessert: We ordered the chocolate temptation cake, the brownie, and the creme brulee.  They got our order wrong so we got a free key lime pie also.  They were all fine, again, nothing that was fantastic.  There was a chocolate creme brulee but didn't actually look like a brulee, more like a mousse, and it was grainy, like the chocolate wasn't mixed properly.  If this was a cheaper restaurant, my rating would be higher.  The size of the bill really make my expectations higher, and Durant's didn't meet them.  I doubt we'll ever go back.  Also, P.s. I don't think there was a handicap woman's stall in the bathroom.  I didn't realize it till later, but I find it unusual to not have one in this day in age.  So fyi.",

When we got there, the host looks up my reservation and then asks us if we want to sit at the bar?! WTF!!! Eat at the bar....WHY?!  I did not want to spoil the mood, so I politely said no, and that we prefer a booth. The dinner was amazing...the oysters, the steak, the scallops and the dessert....they were all good.  But I am never going back there again. I guess I wasnt an old white person and so they wanted me to have my 3-course $180 dinner at the BAR!! Really? Well, too bad, coz you lost my business forever. There are plenty of great steakhouses in the valley and I dont need this kind of treatment when I am out celebrating with my family.",

    "text": "Although I enjoyed the dining experience, Wednesday's visit to Durant's lingered on as a punchline that everybody but I understood.  Prices here are absolutely through-the-roof; higher than world-class steakhouses whose food is considerably better.  The restaurant is a main-drag spot which doesn't look like much from the outside, and the 60's era signage doesn't help.  Much attention is drawn to Durant's being here for over 60 years which, in \"Phoenix years,\" apparently equates with pre-Civil War.  Diners are paraded through what appears to be part of the kitchen into a long and narrow main dining room adorned in bright red velvet wallpaper.  Our server was excellent; thoroughly professional, personable and unobtrusive.    My order was for a 12 oz. prime rib (at $42, if I recall) on a dinner which included the soup of the day and one side.  The corned beef and cabbage soup arrived first; a thin and under seasoned broth with shreds of boiled cabbage, chopped potato and a fine mince of corned beef.  This was a choice which looked better on the menu than it did when placed in front of me; inoffensive, but inconsistent with a meal at this price point.  The prime rib and a large crock of garlic mashed potatoes followed.  Well-trimmed and nicely cooked to order, the prime rib was under seasoned and inadequately seared before roasting.  The meat was a prime grade, but \"wet aged,\" if aged at all; again, failing to fulfill the promise of its menu pricing.  A gravy boat full of seasoned au jus and a small dish of absolutely incendiary grated horseradish (I was warned by our waitress) accompanied the prime rib.  Each imparted some level of the seasoning so noticeably missing from the beef.  The potatoes were exceptional.  I understand that Durant's is Phoenix's old-school steakhouse; the place where politicians and the local business elite gather.  Two tables away a marriage proposal was made-- and accepted.  The food was very good, but the uniqueness and special niche within the local dining scene which added $10+ to a fair market valuation of the meal were lost on this visiting businessman.",

The last time, my date ordered the small prime rib 8 oz and she was delivered about 16 ounces instead -- because it was ALL FAT! For some reason I was foolish enough to order the lamb chops since I had heard they had been great lately. I won't order lamb at most restaurants because it is rarely done correctly, and Durants was solidly with the worst of them.  I gladly pay the price at other restaurants for great food, but if you are looking for some great steak, prime rib, or other great dinners, the best in the area I could send someone to is Feeneys on 12th. I don't think they are the best I've had, but consistently very good at the least.  Great place for happy hour btw, that is the ONLY reason this review isn't one star!",

    "text": "Seriously???  That's what we got for that high of a bill???  Read on...  Full Disclosure:  I know cows, meat, and steaks.  I grew up on a farm raising cattle with my family.  We harvested the stock and slaughtered the meat for the family restaurant.   I've eaten a lot of \"excellent\" and \"bad\" meat in my time.   I've also been to many steak houses in multiple cities.  Finally, I'm not opposed to paying stupid prices if I'm getting an exceptional meal, service, or experience.   The \"bar\" was (and should be) set very high for this establishment based on its cost, reputation, and competition.    Cost:  Prepare to PAY, a lot!!!!  AND....IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!!!   Minimum starting pricing for an 8 oz. steak is in the $24-$25 area.   My 12 oz. prime rib was $32.50 (including a starch, veggies, and soup or salad).  Lowest priced bottle of wine (Red only) is in the $24 range and can sky rocket to $2,000 if you desire.   AGAIN, YOU ARE GOING TO PAY A LOT FOR THIS MEAL!!!    Food:   The prime rib was AVERAGE at best!!!   I could not have been more surprised or disappointed in the meal.   Anyone who knows meat (even just a little bit about meat) could have cooked this meal better than the chef.    The meat was tough, over cooked for how I ordered it, and seriously lacking flavor.     Service:  The service was just \"OK\".  The wait team took care of us but weren't very quick and missed a few requests that were promptly corrected.   Wine:  The only bright spot is a HUGE wine selection that had a reasonably low price point for entry with a \"Wow\" factor at the higher end.   You won't be disappointed in the available selection.  Restaurant/Setting:   Parking is available via valet or a parking lot next to the restaurant.  Either one will cost you $3.00.    Apparently it is \"cool\" to walk through the kitchen before and after meals to the valet parking.   Based on my experience and expectations of this location, this is an over rated 'thrill\".   In fact, it's a pretty bad business practice in terms of liability for the restaurant.   The location has a old style, 1950's feel to it (not the good kind of Americana feeling but the creepy 1970's \"I'm in my odd uncles basement' kind of feeling.   It's a dated location that should be improved.   It's really not all that people seem to think it is for the nostalgia, high end clientele, etc.    Seriously, any steak restaurant in Boston, New York, or Chicago would bury this place.   Overall, save your money.   If you think you are going to impress anyone (or need to actually impress someone) by spending a ton of cash for the \"Durant's\" name then feel free to blow your money (or just give them the cash instead as it will be put to better use).    Go have a good night out is Scottsdale, the Biltmore area, or Arcadia.   You'll spend less on dinner and have some left over for a cocktail to cap the night.    NO, NO, NO, NO, NO....Not for a prom date, not for a proposal, not for your boss, and not even the wife or hubby.   Go somewhere else for better food and a less guilty feeling at the end of the night as you avoid spending your hard earned cash for no reason.",

I happen to like the old school signage / decor, it adds character to a restaurant that has been in the same spot for 60+ years.    They were busy, so it took a while to get drink / appetizer orders, but it wasn't unreasonable.  The only appetizer we got was the spinach-artichoke dip, and it was one of the best I've had.  My wife, my muse, got the wedge salad and it was fresh and also delicious.  I shared the 48 oz. porterhouse with my friend, and let me say that when a hunk of meat that big comes to the table you have to just appreciate the art that it takes to cook it so perfectly.  We got the mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin on the side, which were ideal compliments.    After getting the rest of what we couldn't finish to go, the waiter recommended the strawberry shortcake.  We were all full, but the four of us split - and was quite possibly one of the finest and tastiest desserts ever.  The only drawback, in my opinion, are the tiny, outdated bathrooms - but that's not a dealbreaker.  This is not a cheap night out, but if you have a friend in town and want a great steakhouse, this place can't be beat!",

    "text": "Giving Durant's a 5-star review isn't really all that shocking. It's the Meryl Streep of steakhouses in Phoenix. Still, a recent visit merited a review.  I had a reservation for 4 for a dual birthday celebration last week. The group grew to five and I phoned to ask if that was OK. The maitre d' informed me that they could accommodate, but since 80% of their tables were 4-tops, it might be a half hour or so. Not a problem. We just went to the bar.  We were seated in a booth after about 15 minutes. None of us are exactly slender, and the booth was a tight fit for sure, but we were willing to adapt based on the late change in the reservation. Our waitress, the wonderful Rebecca, would have none of that, and promptly cleared off a recently vacant two top and slid it over and created a much more comfortable dining area.  We started off with drinks and appetizers. Four at the table had the shrimp cocktail, and the shrimp were anything but. With a seafood allergy, I settled for the onion rings. I was pleased with my choice as they were large rings of sweet onion, dipped in a perfectly seasoned batter.  I ordered the prime rib, but was first treated to a very satisfactory dinner salad with (obviously) house-made blue cheese dressing and crouton. When the meat arrived (the medium sized portion), it was cooked to medium rare perfection. I was pleasantly surprised at the heat of the horseradish. This was no wimpy horseradish cream sauce like you get at many steakhouses these days. The garlic mashed potatoes were a great contrast to the bite of the horseradish.   And lastly, the desserts. At our table there were three orders of key lime pie and one order of the trio of creme brulee, along with various cappuccino and coffee orders. The fresh mint sprig on the top of the key lime pie was a nice added touch. And for birthdays? No cheesy song from the waitstaff. Instead, a simple candle on the pie. Perfection.  Rebecca was just what you would expect the staff at Durant's to be: knowledgeable, genuinely friendly, unobtrusive, and unflappable. The perfect addition to a wonderful birthday meal.  We left with our belts let out a notch and our wallets empty, but it was definitely worth it.",

If Mad Men ever had an episode set in PHX, Don Draper would eat at Durant's; no other restaurant would even exist for him. It's like eating red meat in a time machine.  The thing about it is that the charm of the place is not a gimmick. Everything is super REAL, from the menu, the clientele, the velvet setting, to the paintings of pugs over overstuffed booths, down to the cufflinks on our attentive waiter. No one here is faking it for the sake of authenticity, it really is this way because they nailed it, and they stuck with it, and if it ain't broke, why fix it?  We tried the filet mignon, the sauteed spinach, and the grilled scallops. EVERYTHING was remarkable, satisfying, and superb... But you knew that already.  You wanna be somebody? Head to Durant's.",

You can even a half order which is plenty for 3-4 people. They bring out a relish tray and some bread so a half steak is plenty and affordable. The deserts are divine. I think we have tried all of them and they have delicious coffee to go with them. One negative note is they do not carry dairy free creamer.",

Shared a dozen oysters, a spinach salad with the T-bone steak medium (a little pricey@$56) that wasn't the best cut nor did it taste properly cooked with garlic mash potatoes that were delicious and cooked veggies. Due to the taste of the steak our waiter immediately served another entree which was the filet that had more flavor and cooked to perfection.   Great service, cool ambience, easy to get to location and great menu selection to choose from. Thus getting 4 stars.",

It has classic old school charm with wood paneling and a red tint inside. You can enter through the kitchen, which is a great experience. The atmosphere is dark and romantic. Service is absolutely impeccable, as they make you feel like family.  But the food steals the show here.  They bring great, homemade bread with oil and leeks to start. It was difficult not to fill up on the bread because it was so good. They also bring a platter of raw vegetables with dipping sauce.  I had the calamari for an appetizer. The portion was huge, and it was perfectly fried. Unlike a lot of calamari dishes, it was not overly heavy or greasy. The squid itself was unbelievably fresh. All in all an excellent dish.  The Caesar salad was great as well. It was dressed perfectly and the vegetables all had a great crisp. The dressing was clearly homemade, well balanced, with a strong hint of anchovy.  Most importantly, the steak was excellent. A perfect medium rare filet mignon with a nice hard char on the outside. It cut like butter with a good amount of marbling throughout the filet. The baked potato served alongside the filet was cooked well and served with sour cream.  For dessert, I had their famous strawberry shortcake. It was amazing!!! One of the largest desserts I've ever had. Every element of it was homemade.  All in all, one of the best steakhouses in America.",

Some may consider it a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  For many, it is their go-to for special occasions. And you can always sit at the bar for happy hour, which I used to do on a regular basis when I worked downtown. I just booked a reservation for our annual family dinner with the kids and grandkids. The decor is what you would expect when you are talking prime rib and martinis, but we have found it even kid friendly when we book an early evening with the young grandkids. (They are extremely well behaved and have always been welcomed.) This place is a classic. How many times have I been to Durant's? Certainly in the hundreds. And never, never a bad experience.",

We showed up in shorts and tee shirts, my wife even had a hat on, and they didn't bat a lash. The seats are plush, red leather booths, there are giant bouquets of fresh flowers by every table, and the waitstaff are all black tie. The walls are wood paneled and red velvet wallpapered, so it's got a very old school vibe, but in a way that feels fresh. It seemed popular for special events or business meetings, and the staff was almost all male, but its cozy. Also, word to the wise, the back entrance goes through the kitchen!",

I wanted to linger but perhaps another time when they aren't so busy.   We were seated immediately and brought ice water and a crudites plate. Nice touch. Our server, Michelle, offered to place our drinks while another server brought the bread: a small sourdough loaf smothered in olive oil and sauteed leeks.   We ordered Oysters Rockefeller as our appetizer.  For entrees, my wife and I were thinking similar: Filet Minion and Shrimp for her, Filet and Scallops for me. We each got a salad but while she wanted a baked potato, while I craved the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes.   After we finished the bread and salads, the oysters arrived, hot and bubbly. Lots of sauce, cheese and bacon-excellent!  Our entrees were not disappointing either. The scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked and the steaks?  Incredible. Juicy, cooked to perfection, seasoned well and tender as only Filet can be.   The total bill, with tip, was $220. Definitely worth the meal. We took a considerable amount of food home but we couldn't bring the five star service home. Michelle and her staff excelled at staying professional yet comfortable.   I recommend Durant's for a romantic, very tasty meal!",

Service was good to excellent, nice wine selection, steaks were also good to excellent.  As far as others comparing it to Ruth Chris (and other chain steak houses), well it ain't Ruth's... thank God!  No R. C. has this atmosphere and look, really old school but still real.  Parking in rear was easy and free.  Construction was going on in the street making finding the place and access a little tough but that may be over by now.  I grant you the place is not for everyone one but I definitely do recommend and will return.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst dining experiences ever!  We, a party of four, came for AZ Restaurant week. We waited about 30 minutes before our order was taken,  much too long. We were brought a relish tray that was really meant for 2 but there were 4 of us.  Odd.      2 of us opted for the PrixFix menu.  The brie in puff pastry was really very undercooked, and appeared the kitchen was rushed just to get it out,  a revelation of what was to come.   The $5.95 upcharge for caesar salad and oddly placed anchovies on the edge of the plate was just weird.  Given the so called classy-ness of this place, they should have been mixed in with the dressing.    The pork chop was ordered medium and specifically so to the waitress that it not be dry.  It came out very dry, and nearly un-edible.   Prime rib was very thick and exceptionally dry. Both the pork chop and prime rib had to be taken off the bill.   Our waitress was not engaged for most of the dinner,  and was extremely busy for service...way too busy to attend to her diners.  Management was apologetic enough to comp the meals.  This place is very drab, dark and absolutely stuck in the era in which it was opened.  The same red velvet wallpaper is on the walls,   the clientele considerably older, as if the only patrons are the very ones who have kept the place going since the beginning.   Once these patrons are dead this place will be too.  Highly overrated, highly overpraised, way too noisy and highly overpriced.  This is NOT a place for people who expect and enjoy a very high standard of food quality, service and ambience.    I pity the diner who does not heed this review...eat at your own risk but don't say i didn't warn you.",

There is nothing like coming here on a weeknight and chatting with the bartender (the bald dude) who has been making me killer cocktails for years (especially when I lived just a mile or so away). The only reason I give four stars is because some of the hosts there can be a little surly. I understand that tables are only for dining, but when it's not busy this seems like a silly rule to enforce. Plus, when I go there only for drinks, I usually spend *more* than if I were going there for dinner and a drink or two. Anyway, may this place long live on.",

My young adult kids know we love this place so my daughter and her husband purchased two $50 gift certificates for Christmas.  They gave one to me and one to my husband. We were planning to celebrate our anniversary and my husband could not locate his gift certificate. Mine had a serial number so I called and explained that my husbands gift certificate would be the number right next to mine.  They were signed by a manager and I mentioned her name, I also gave the date of purchase. They said they would look into it but called back and said we can't get credit without the card.  This was the case even though he looked it up and clearly knew my daughters name which is obviously logged into a book.  What makes it worse is the fact that my daughter is in a grad program so has no income this year.  They are on a really tight budget and it makes me really sad to know they had to waste $50.  I take responsibility for my husband misplacing it but I've never had any other lost giftcard not be tracked and replaced.  No more gift cards to this place!! Why have serial number on your gift certificates if you still won't honor them.  It can clearly be tracked and we would have no intentions of using the card and making this up to try to use again.  It was such a disappointment that we just cancelled our reservations.",

There are all kinds of cuts available up to 48 ounces of craziness. But, since I don't eat beef, I can only report that the grilled baramundi was perfectly cooked. It came with garlic mashed potatoes that were excellent. I also ordered sauteed mushrooms and sauteed spinach, both of which were a good addition to the table.

I've been here a handful of times on business lunches, dinners and happy hours. The Crab Louie salad is what you expect, as is the Chicken Caesar, the French Dip is amazing (rivals Houston's) and save room for the Strawberry Shortcake, which is just enormous and looks boring but somehow you inhale it all.   I fully expect to make this stop a regular on the happy hour circuit. Sure, it's jam-packed with business tycoons and gold-diggers who practically bump you out of your stool as they lean over to see if your husband's wearing a wedding ring...but just sit back and enjoy the show that is Durant's.   On a budget but still want a snack? Order a beer, which is generously garnished with salami and cheese. Can't beat that.",

Positives:   Atmosphere Old school decor (straight out of the 60's) Courteous wait staff  Negatives: Horribly over priced-  I've had a better Ribeye at Houston's and it didn't cost $48.  Steak quality was not what I expected.  Ribeye is a well marbled steak, but these had a lot of gristle, were not nearly the quality I'd expect for the 5 star price.  5 Guys and Red Robin make much better fries....seriously, I have shoe laces that are firmer.  One person in my party complained about the lack of steak quality and had a plateful of gristle and fat on his plate.  My verdict.... I was anticipating a steak dinner that was top notch.  It was far from that.  Perhaps they just had a poor quality slab to cut the steaks from, but at $50 a steak, someone in the kitchen should gave caught it.  Plenty of other great places in Phoenix to eat a marvelous steak....and I prefer those after this dinner.",

For entrees we have the filet, ribeye, and prime rib.When the food came, my plate was missing in action.  Eh, whatever. They corrected it within about five minutes. Everything tasted delicious. The primerib is my favorite though - paired with garlic mashed potatoes and au jus to die for! Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Yum!  To sum it up: delicious food with a gorgeous ambiance.

Hanny's and AZ88 and others use fancy Schweppes bottles, why the skimping here?  #2:  I ordered an $18 Kobe burger.  I know its a steak place, but I figure a steak place should be able to make a decent burger.  I was wrong.  \"Kobe\" burger was a machine-formed patty on an uncooked onion bun with a pickle and some batter-coated fries.  Denny's has a better burger.  It was very less than marginal.

I was needless to say embarrassed and looked bad in front of my client.  My client stated he has never been asked to vacate a table for another party.  The old Durants that I used to know would have apologized and asked if we would be agreeable if they moved us to another table.  They just asked us to vacate the premises.

I called ahead of time to see if a reservation was needed and was told there were no openings until 9:30 at night but we could sit at the bar and have dessert (if there was any seating).  We showed our chip to the bartender and were told we could only use it with purchase of an entree.  We told her that nowhere on the chip did it state that fact.  She told us that if they just gave away free desserts they would be out of business (as if we were the idiots...we have no idea how many of these chips they give away or how common or rare they are).  We asked to speak to the manager who was just as rude when we tried to explain that coupons have to have their terms printed on them by law and you cannot just make terms on the spot.  There was no apology for the confusion or attempt to right the wrong.  Thanks for ruining our date night (although I doubt you care)!  If they would have said sorry and offered us a one time dessert we would have been understanding.  I hope the couple we gifted the chip to enjoy it because we will never set foot into Durant's again!",

I had the ham, Brie and apple sandwich, except I subbed turkey for the ham and it was excellent. Fries were good, a little overdone. Sweet potato fries did get rave reviews from the other people in my group. Burgers are MASSIVE.   Price was perhaps a little high for a lunch of sandwiches/burgers, but the quality of the food was definitely not lacking.",

    "text": "Okay, so this really ought to be a 4.5 star, but I'm rounding down for a few reasons.  Three co-workers and myself were in town for the weekend for a trade show, and knew we wanted to eat well while we were here.  John spied an ad in the airport, and when Yelp confirmed it was probably a good choice (and it ended up being close to the hotel!), we decided to give it a shot.  We called for availability, and they had seating at 8pm.  Great!  First off, I thought it was kinda cute to enter the restaurant through the kitchen, but to be honest, NOBODY in my party was feeling 100% well, as we were all fighting off some sort of crud.  This could have made for a hygienic nightmare if one of us had started coughing...  We were seating in a cozy booth (love the colors and the decor!), water was poured, and we were handed menus.  John was immediately drawn to the 48 oz. Porterhouse, but resisted the temptation and instead settled for the 12 oz. Filet Mignon, with a side order of the crab macaroni and cheese.  Sheri and Hayden both ordered the Prime Rib (8 oz. and 12 oz. respectively), and I opted to order from the special Restaurant Week menu that was offered (choose one item from each of 3 courses).  The waiter brought us the special house bread - served with garlic and leeks dripping in butter slathered on top.  The flavor was - interesting.  I personally would have preferred more garlic and less leek.  The bread was tasty, though, and the texture was perfect.  For my first course, I selected the Pear and Walnut salad, tossed with mixed greens, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette.  I have to say, this was my favorite course, and I ate EVERY BITE!  The goat cheese had a delightful flavor, and the pears and walnuts were a perfect complement.  The main courses came next.  Sheri and Hayden both enjoyed their Prime Rib.  John declared the Filet to have a bit too much char on one side to suit his taste, although other than that it was apparently quite good.  My Pot Roast was tasty, although a bit too dry.  The gravy helped with that, but there wasn't quite enough of it.  The vegetables served with the Pot Roast were very good.  I opted for the selected wine pairing: a very nice Pinot Noir, which i enjoyed  great deal.  The crab macaroni and cheese?  Marvelous!  I almost wish I'd chosen that for my main course (although it hadn't been an option).  Too bad I only had room for a couple of small bites of it!  At last, my dessert arrived - a chocolate espresso mousse with whipped cream on top.  It was thick, but still light, and only the tiniest bit too sweet - I usually like my chocolate dark.  I shared it with whoever wanted some, but we were all far too full to have more than a couple of bites, and the dessert went sadly unfinished.  Would I come back again?  If I ever find myself in Phoenix with a pocketful of money just itching to be spent, yes, I believe I would.",

    "text": "So when five out five people in your group all walk down to the lobby of the hotel and each coincidentally say that they want to try Durant's AND the concierge recommends it - it's a no-brainer. Plus, it was only two blocks away from the hotel we were staying at (Hilton Suites) and we could just walk there.  When you walk into this place, you immediately go back in time to 1960... and you almost almost want to walk up to the bar, order up a dirty martini and turn to the guy next to you so you can plan a hit on your latest rival... So basically, it's dimly lit, the bartender and waiters are dressed in snazzy maroon vests and bow ties and the bartender talks to you like he's known you for years and makes smart ass remarks about the drinks you order.  The menu is fabulous!! Steak and seafood - heaven. I was conflicted with so much emotion! Crab claws? Oysters? Prime rib? Rib eye? I wanted everything! I ended up ordering shrimp bisque and prime rib w/ mashed potatoes. They brought out some fresh baked bread that had a nice artichoke olive oil dressing on it - rave reviews from everyone at the table! The shrimp bisque was magnificent. I am a HUGE fan of bisques and I was not disappointed. My only resignation was the prime rib. I made a mistake in ordering it medium-well and it was not fantastic. I love prime rib and I usually ordered it medium-rare, but went for a more well. Next time I'll get it medium.  All in all, I was pleased AND I have this really neat token that guarantees me free desserts FOR LIFE. Too bad I don't live in Phoenix.",

I love the traditional food of the place, my succulent shrimp cocktail , oysters  with hottest horseradish know to man , thick meaty prime rib and a lovely lemon drop cocktail that  begs me to keep sipping away.  The place just symbolizes a different style and era of dining and I love it. If  they get rid of that red velvet flocked wallpaper I will seriously cry .",

Yes, walking through the kitchen may seem strange, but that is one of the things that makes it unique. There are so many chain bars in this town, it is nice to have something that has a bit of character.  I found the drinks to be a bit expensive, although they fill them literally to the top and they spill all over, so it's more like two drinks. Service is mainly good, depending on who your bartender is. Overall, I think this is a great place to have cocktails. I have not eaten the food as I am vegan, so that pretty much cuts out everything on the menu.  The one complaint I have is they need to bring back the music. They used to play Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin on the stereo, but no more. Good music makes the mood, so PLEASE bring it back.",

Or if you can get to Florida, Berns is what's up!  I thought it was odd to be sat in the bar area with reservations.  Parking is not clear. Signs say valet yet no one was out there. I had to ask a guy taking out the trash if I could park wherever I liked.    Walking in and exiting through the kitchen ... what is up with that?  I felt lost and as if I came in the wrong way. At least have someone there greeting you or something to let you know you came in the correct way. It was a bit awkward to me.",

This is only our 2nd time at Durant's.  I'm going back again next Christmas Eve for sure.  Hands down, we had one of the best meals ever!    PS - I love going in thru the kitchen.  Durants . . .

We attempted to call (phone was not being answered) to make a reservation and we attempted to make one on Open Table and we were not able to book one. Our out of country guests wanted to eat early so we took a chance and went by. Upon arrival we were told that they were completely booked. It was a Wednesday and there were empty tables but I get it, I'm sure they were reserved. Being turned away is not a big deal. What was disappointing was that when my husband walked back in to request change to tip the valet, he was met with a dirty look and pursed lips by the hostess. This kind of restaurant is right up our alley and we visit Phoenix often so I would like to give it a second chance even though it is never appropriate to greet a guest with a dirty look. However I will say that the kitchen staff was very friendly and apologized that we could not be seated.",

    "text": "Durant's is an institution and now that we live just 4 blocks away, the wife and I have been getting our prime rib fix from here far more often than we should.  Durant's knows how to steak. The meal begins with a lovely vegetable crudite on ice and their famous butter garlic leek bread, served by professionals who are friendly and on top of their game, and a support staff that ensures you never see the bottom of your glass.   Not content to simply deliver a solitary piece of meat on the plate like some ultra-high-end chop houses, their steaks include a salad and choice of potato, which is greatly appreciated.  We always upgrade to their Caesar salad, which borders on perfection: the dressing coats everything lightly, the plate is freezing cold as damn well it should be, and the lettuce is extremely fresh and crisp.  If you want to splurge, their shrimp cocktail, while a bit pricey, features four enormous, two-bite-each jumbo shrimp, with a stir-it-yourself-thank-god cocktail sauce with some of the hottest horseradish known to man. The details matter: the lemon they provide has a sheath to ensure that the juice goes on your shrimp and not your date.  The main event is fantastic, though I must admit I've simply never ordered anything other than the prime rib, rare, with a baked potato. It's seasoned beautifully, extremely flavorful, and always served to perfection. The baked potato is good, though I prefer when they're coated in just a bit more salt on the outside. My wife tried their garlic mashed our last time, though, and I think I may have to switch from here on out--they were that good.  Dessert, if your heart allows for it, is also typically great. The strawberry shortcake for two is actually for four, and, pro tip, you can order a half portion and still have enough for three people easily. Our last visit was for my birthday and they brought out their brownie sandwich, which was extremely tasty and appreciated.  We've always had great service, the decor is True to its roots, and if you haven't been during the holidays, Durant's does it UP at Christmas. Do yourself a favor and walk through the kitchen, and thank them for what you're about to partake.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.  So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.    The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are True professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.  Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.",

    "text": "We were downtown and looking for an uncommon dining experience, and on the car ride we were taking about crab, beef, wedge salads so Durant's seemed like a natural and obvious choice. My friend had never been, and its probably been five years since my last visit. It was destiny.  As I pulled into the packed parking lot (at 5:54 p.m.) on a Saturday night, the lot was filled and I giggled. Durant's has that natural 'it' factor that is such a nice pull and draw. I looked at my friend and said \"Uh, we're probably eating in the bar, this parking lot is filled and all these folks are inside that little restaurant.\" I was right.  So, I led her through the door that naturally guides you through the kitchen and then the dining room before you visit the dining room captain. Its a great part of the experience. The pristine kitchen full of hustle and bustle, and kitchen employees that speak perfectly good English and greet you upon entering and leaving the restaurant. I love this aspect of the restaurant; it feels really good to me. It smells of dripping hospitality to me and not in a syrupy way, but more of a \"yeah, we're proud of what we do, and we've done it longer than any other Mastro's-style-hip-newster in town, and we're still kick ass!\"   So, anyway, I speak briefly to the dining room captain, did I mention that they wear tuxedos in the dining room. Ah! Love it! So old school and its just fine with me. I look at the reservation system that he has on his desk and I laugh, because, our visit isn't planned and he has names collected and color-coded all over the screen. We're having a spontaneous dinner, I don't think spontaneity and a full service-dining-room-table-type-of-meal-at-Durant's goes hand in hand. So, I ask if we could have the full menu in the bar and they're thrilled. \"Sure, ladies, come on in!\"  We belly up to the bar (which I love anyway), and I \"sample\" two different sips of wine before I settle on the wine I want with dinner and my friend has a Martini that is classically perfect while we wait for our dinner to arrive. Our bartender was incredibly busy, but remained proficient, aware, thorough and we loved her! For me this was the classic Chicago-Gibson's-style steak dinner event that we were hoping to find. We weren't disappointed.  The bill came. I thought my friend was going to fall out of her chair - its not cheap and on the way home, we had a conversation about value. She'd give them maybe 3.5 stars on value orientation. I'm not wavering from my five stars and here's why:   I don't eat like this everyday and I have enough left over steak to feed my steak and eggs this morning, my lunch and dinner for the day, and probably tomorrow as well. It was a huge, juicy, piece of cow and it was perfectly prepared and yeah, I won't need to spend $62/person for another several years.   We departed through the kitchen and this time my friend stops and blows the entire kitchen staff a kiss goodbye and I am pretty sure they fell over themselves admiring her, well, naturally, God-given beauty and two of them rushed to open the back door for her. That was the kicker, she'll pay for this type of attention again.   Classic...",

    "text": "I really think that 2 stars is a fairly generous rating for this restaurant given my recent experience here.  Buy I will give points for the history and the ambiance, both of which I am very fond of.  The food, service and prices, however, were well off-base.  I took a group of out-of-town business associates here during a conference at the Phoenix Convention Center.  I wanted to take them somewhere that is \"uniquely Phoenix\", and I felt that Durant's fit that description.  I have eaten here before, and i thought it was OK, but many of my same complaints were consistent on this visit.  First, I hate restaurants where the bar makes you close the tab with them before you head to your table.  Any quality establishment should put the diner's convenience before the bartenders tip and allow you to transfer your bar tab to your table bill.  On a business function, this makes accounting very sticky, and is awkward when you have to stop, ask for the bar bill, run your card, sign it, then proceed to your table.  I know that bartenders do it to maximize their tips (I used to be one), but it is bush league, and should have no place in a restaurant like Durants.  Our waiter was flat out terrible.  This little weasel obviously did not want to be there and let the world know it.  Not only was his attitude poor, but his timing was awful.  We sat for almost 3 hours, most of the time waiting for him to take orders or bring food.  We never saw the guy.  Our drinks were rarely if ever full, but he was sure to try and up-sell more bottles of wine when the time came.  When you are paying that kind of money to eat in a place like Durants, the server had better be representative of the price.  He was not.  Durant's has a very, very strange pricing scheme.  some things are priced well, other things are absolutely obnoxious.  Specifically the appetizers are way out of line.  Apps were in the $15+ range which is flat out absurd.  I dont mind paying for food, but I do expect value, and you will NOT find it at Durants.  I ordered a stuffed potato with my steak instead of the standard baker and it was a $5 upgrade.  That is ridiculous.  The food was pretty good - the oysters Rockefeller were outstanding and were clearly the best part of the dinner.  My steak, a $51 bone in ribeye, was on the poor side of average and worth about $11.  Very tough and fibrous, I was not impressed.  It was tasty, but I have had far, far better elsewhere on many occasions.  Again, it was the value that annoyed me about this place.  Avoid the crab macaroni and cheese at all costs.  Horrible.  Barely edible, no flavor, the large rigatoni's didnt really go with the white cheese cream sauce and chunks of crab.  Pretty bad.  I will say that the wine was very WELL priced, and we appreciated that.  Once again, the inconsistency in pricing was perplexing.  The thing that really, really blew it for me though was the 48oz Porterhouse challenge.  The thing is like $85 and \"if you can eat it all\" your name goes on the wall.  We bet one of my colleagues that he could not finish it, and each guy threw in $20 as a prize.  The steak arrived and it was about 35oz of bone and about 12oz of meat.  My mother could have finished that steak and ordered desert.  This is one of the biggest marketing scams that I have ever seen in a restaurant.  The whole \"challenge\" concept is obviously designed to get you to order an $85 steak.  My ribeye had more meat on it and was probably harder to eat.  We should have known what to expect when we asked the waiter how many people finish it, and he said \"about 5 people order it each day, and about 3 out of 5 finish it.\"  Pathetic.  So if you are going out for a drink in Phoenix, head to Durants and have a martini at the bar.  Order the oysters Rockefeller while you are there.  These aspects of the restaurant are really, really great.  Then finish your drink and head to another steakhouse for a great steak that will not disappoint you like Durant's.",

    "text": "Went looking for a nice spot for dinner on our one night in Phoenix. Yelp came through. We made our reservations through Open Table. Even made a special request for a semi-circle booth (thanks to one of the Yelp reviews!).  Our reservation was for 8 pm on a Friday night. We were actually sitting in our semi-circle booth at 8:30- granted, had we not specified where we wanted to sit, I'm quite certain it wouldn't have taken so long.  Nevertheless, we got a chance to look at the restaurant decor and watch the staff in action.  Seems like this place gets a lot of longstanding customers and a lot of new people. An interesting mix- there was a guy wearing a bright yellow hawaiian shirt, brown suspenders and high water velvet tuxedo pants with sandals!  Then there's the date crowd, the middle-aged party animals, and random sprinklings of other like us.   I had the New York steak- medium with the baked potato and clam chowder for my appetizer (which came WITH the meal thank-you-very-much). The hubby had the Delmonico- medium rare with garlick mashed potatoes and clam chowda. We came to a consensus that my steak was seasoned far better than his...possibly his didn't have time to cook/marinate in its own juices since it was so rare? Who knows. We walked away satisfied for under a hundred bucks.  Side note- we came with a bottle of wine we were hoping to have...and quickly found out that since the restaurant has such an extensive collection of wines (over 450), they do not allow corkage. Back to the car we went!  Additionally, valet parking is complimentary and there really was no dress code. We came business casual....but found people in there in tank tops and jeans.",

It's also a lively and classy night spot, something that didn't exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durant's overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool.   And that's what Durnat's is really about. Yeah, the steak is pretty good. The seafood's alright. The bread with the hot garlic butter is awesome. But Durant's is just COOL.

Durant's is one of the restaurants that Phoenix truly tends to miss alot because of our young age as a city, and the amount of turn around in restaurants in the downtown corridor.  Many of the restaurants have gone out of business, so there are very few that aren't new and hip.  There is just something to say about a restaurant that has been doing it right for decades.  I went back this past weekend and really enjoyed my time at Durant's.  We started off with an order of Oysters Rockefeller and their wonderful bread covered in better and garlic and deliciousness.  The oysters were absolutely perfect.  Next up was the house salad with blue cheese, nothing special here, but it was done to perfection in a classic house salad manner.  For the main course, I went with prime rib, which is always perfect.  I went with the baked potato this time over the garlic mashed (both are great).  We have made this an annual tradition before a friends 50/60s Hollywood Christmas Party, and the atmosphere fits our attire absolutely perfectly.  I can't wait to come back.",

WHAT WHAT!!?? Ice cream, that through me for a loop.  I had no idea bartender goddess.   I said no to the ice cream and yes to half and half.  My Grasshopper was awesome with the half and half.  Next time with ice cream baby.  People at the bar liked the looks of my drinks and asked for their own.  I felt like little miss trend setter.  If you go to drink at Durant's, do some research on vintage cocktails and most likely the bartenders there will make it perfectly.  It's fun to try the drinks of old men. Wink ; )  On that same visit I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger and mashed potatoes.  The bun was crisp and flaky.  The veggies were firm and fresh.  The burger was juicy and primally good.  Meat GOOD!!!  Durant's has been around for a long time.  It is the place for a power lunch or a sophisticated dinner.  The only thing better about the food at Durant's is the superb service.  I think the staff are telepathic and they communicate our needs to each other.  Even the valet guy had our car ready as my guest and I walked out the kitchen exit.

My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach...   The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor.   It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there.

It still boasts weird pictures hanging on the wall of some unnamed man (hmmm? Mr. Durant himself)!? I always opt for the bar area weather having dinner or not.  I'm not one for big dining rooms and don't mind eating at the bar, especially with the excellent service the bartender offers.  This is a favorite among my friends for birthdays, happy hours, and of course Valentine's Day! (with your friends or your significant other:) My favorites on the menu: garlic mashed potatoes, fillet mignon, scallops, and all of the salads.   Go, dine, enjoy it is worth the extra dollars:)",

    "text": "Delicious food and top-notch service. Very old school, and not much of a younger crowd (it's pricey) but completely worth it. We came here for an anniversary meal (if 15 months counts as an anniversary?) and loved it but were stuffed afterwards. I would seriously suggest fasting before dining here! You're given veggies and ranch to start, along with some super-creamy bread with garnish. Many meals come with a soup/salad and side so it's a lot of food altogether. I had the 8oz filet and mashed potatoes, with a Caesar salad. The steak and potatoes were perfection. The Caesar salad was standard. Also had some good red wine with the meal. I don't know how anyone could have room for dessert after eating here though! It's a unique dining experience, and especially cool that you enter and exit through the kitchen. Servers are sweet and not at all stuffy. Classy atmosphere. No cell phones are allowed (except in the lounge) and there's an awesome footnote on the menu that if you don't see your fave foods on there, you can ask and they'll do their best to prepare them for you- what?? Pretty awesome.",

    "text": "Going to Durant's is like stepping back in time where the lighting was a bit darker, the booths leather, and the wallpaper a dark red with velvet. You get to the restaurant by walking through the kitchen which starts off your experience. You don't see many people on their cellphones and you can even find a pay phone in the restaurant.  Durants reminds me of dinner my mom use to talk about how they would last a bit longer. Your appetizers were brought out and you didn't get your salads until you were finished so expect to spend some time. People here are enjoying the slower pace and the extremely attentive wait staff and having fun talking to each other.  They start you off with some raw vegetables and then bring you this garlic bread that's covered in butter ( delicious).  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was very good, the breeding was very light and the calamari cooked perfectly. My friend and I both got the prime rib which was cooked perfectly and it was so easy to cut. We both got the garlic mashed potatoes and shared a side of asparagus which came with a delicious hollandaise sauce. The horseradish sauce was great as well. I opted to pay a little extra and get the Cesar salad which was good but their house salad looked perfect with dark greens (not typical ice berg). We shared the creme brulee for desert where you get a sample of three kinds; an amaretto, berry, and a chocolate. My favorite was the amaretto  This is a great place to go and experience but keep in mind the prices reflect the quality of food they are set of but it's well worth is from time to time",

It is as beautiful as ever and the wait staff is exceptional as always, but the food wasn't even remotely close to what it used to be. We spend 100$ for a light lunch/supper break. We ordered a side of broccoli with cheese on it and was brought out some microwaved broccoli (under cooked ) with a SLICE OF AMERICAN CHEESE ON TOP. I was stunned. The cheese wasn't even completely melted as the last culinary slap in the face. For what we paid, that should have been seasoned broccoli with grated craft cheese and maybe some pinon nuts or something nice. I was so embarrassed as I had talked this place up to my friend before I took her in. Beautiful ambiance, nice place maybe to have a cocktail, but the food is no longer worthy.",

    "text": "What do you get when you eat at Durant's? Atmosphere. Dark leather, heavily padded seating. Low lighting. Dark wood. Elements that would look appropriate in a Frank Sinatra film. It had a very 60's feel to it.   What you won't get: is easy entry/exit, or food and service to match the prices.   There are two entrances: the front is on a narrow sidewalk adjacent to a busy street on the opposite side of the building from parking, which is in the back. The parking is shared with other popular businesses, and is inadequate for demand. Upon arriving at 6 pm, the only slots available were held by the valets. There is no proper roundabout for valet service, with entrances from two streets interfering with traffic. Valets sometimes had to perform two and three point turns to get vehicles into the parking traffic lanes.   The main entrance is through the rear, which leads through the kitchen. This may be cute as an uncommon entrance for special customers, but seems ill advised as the primary entrance for all customers.   We were greeted politely, and seated quickly for our reservations, made just an hour before hand.   The service was good, but not excellent. The server himself was very friendly when facing you, but a little too curt. He cut off his sentences about 1/2 second too soon, always turning quickly to scurry away. He might have been overworked, serving four tables in approximately the same state of ordering/eating as our table. His assistant was more attentive and more pleasant, even though she was trying to be discreet: avoiding eye contact and being almost mute. She earned the tip.   The food was good, but not excellent. I had a bone-in rib-eye, with garlic mashed potatoes and a seafood bisque. The bisque was good, but unremarkable. The garlic mashed potatoes were the least impressive of any I've had in any restaurant. Better fare is available on this item from Texas Roadhouse. The steak was well trimmed, and cooked medium with a well controlled char, with a minimum of spices. It was good, but examples from The Keg are better. Oh, how I miss Monti's steaks.   My wife had prime rib, medium, with loaded potato and salad. The prime rib is in the bottom 1/4 of all I've experienced. A cafeteria provided by a former employer served better prime rib on average. Again Monti's won out in this category. Examples from Lawry's were also better.   The best item on the table was a side: the loaded baked potato. It appears to be a rendition of a twice-baked potato: the starchy interior is mashed, accompanied by bacon, cheese, and sour cream, and re-baked in the bottom half of the potato shell. It could be a little more creamy (Idaho native here), but the taste was good.   The signature \"leeks sauteed in butter over bread\" was the 2nd best item.   Several restaurants serving more traditional fare have closed in Phoenix in the recent past: Monti's, Pinnacle Peak, etc. The owners say that the restaurant public is moving on to new fare: lighter/more healthy foods, new menu items. This restaurant represents a conceptual and literal link to the past: it is a low slung, small building. Literally across the street are much newer sky scrapers with shining, mirrored exteriors. This building lives in their shadow. The customers seemed to be from the same era the restaurant came from: most were grey/white haired and Caucasian.   So to summarize: If you wanna feel like a (mob) gangsta, or want a piece of the past, eat here. But know you can have better food for 1/2 the price elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'd love to give Durant's five stars because it does so much right.  It gets soooo close to \"hitting for the cycle,\" but its home run--the steak--falls a tad short...   The unassuming exterior of Durant's is charming, in a way, especially when contrasted with the classic interior.  Velvet red decor, nostalgia captured liberally in framed pictures, power-lunch seating layout, a lovely wrap-around bar, adult-worthy martinis, a great wine list, and exceptional service.  It's just, the steaks...  You can walk into Durant's from the boring front door or through the rear, which takes you through the kitchen proper and to the hosting booth.  The kitchen would be right at home in a 1930's NYC spot, and it is oddly appetizing to see how the sausage is made.  I just wish, ugh, the steaks...  Every meal is preceded by bread, on the house.  It's round, has a dense exterior and soft interior, and is drowning in a rich oil rife with garlic and parsley.  It's quite a nice freebie for a steakhouse.  Have one or two of their epic martinis, some bread, and tell them to take their time on the main course.  Which will probably be their steaks....  If you want the full monty, take them up on their Oysters Rockerfeller or Stone Crab Claws.  The latter is flown in from southern Florida and quite lovely (though pricey).  Plus it's a model for sustainability:  the crabs are caught, the crabs are relieved of their burdensome claws, and the crabs are returned to the ocean where they will regrow those claws.  It's kind of a feel good way to eat crab meat, which combines so well with steaks.  Speaking of their steaks...  Did i mention that their desserts are phenomenal?  Doh, okay, I'll address my complaint about their steaks.  I've been many times, and have tried the range:  filet, ribeye, t bone, porterhouse, prime rib, etc.  Of them, my favorite was the prime rib, and that is the issue.   Every other cut should be superior to the prime rib.  I'm simply not convinced that Durant's is sourcing the best cuts.  The top flight of national steakhouses--and by virtue of price, Durant's intends to compete with them--source delectably marbled, prime steak.  And you can tell when eating it.  But Durant's doesn't seem to.  The steaks are generally dry and indistinguishable from something you could get at a mid-range grocery store, or at an otherwise fine restaurant that does not focus on steaks.  Those found at A-team alternatives (Mastros, Ruths Chris, Capital Grill, etc.) are consistently top notch, regardless of preparation technique.  Don't get me wrong, you wont confuse Durant's with the leather served at Applebee's, but I suspect you will question whether your steak was worth $45.  The prime rib is juicy, meaty, with a well-season crust, and very satisfying with au jus and creamy or raw horseradish.    Durant's gets A marks in all categories but one -- and the miss is in that most important category.  If you're into prime rib, it's all A's, no question.  If you're not, I recommend going elsewhere for your steak.  I didn't elaborate on lunch, but it may be the way to go.  Come in for a martini lunch on a weekend and try the prime rib or a steak sandwich as the main.  All the frills without the price tag of a choice steak masquerading as prime.  That sounds harsher than it's meant to be because Durant's is an experience worth having, but temper your steak expectations.",

    "text": "Filet mignon and scallops were on point. Thick cut, dry aged beef. Not the best steak of my life, but very good and well cooked. One of my three scallops was still quite sandy, which was disappointing in a restaurant where you would expect a better food preparation. 4 stars on steak, 2 stars on scallops. The garlic mashed potatoes had too much butter and cream in them for my liking, making the consistency and texture a little too smooth and pasty. Good flavor still, but probably only ate 3-4 bites out of a VERY good sized portion.   The Manhattan clam chowder was perhaps the best I've ever had. Tons of clam meat, perfectly cooked potato, and a nice thick (but not too heavy or rich) broth. 5 stars on the soup!  The bread was amazing. Great texture and the dipping sauce was fantastic. Hate filling up on bread, but I did have two pieces. :-) 5 stars  Had a piece of key lime pie for dessert. Had a much more subtle, subdued flavor than I usually find with key lime, which I appreciated, as it can often be too tart to really want to eat the whole slice. Very smooth custard ended up having a texture more like a good cheesecake, but still with good citrusy flavor from the lime. Would have liked a tad thicker base crust, but I'll give it 4.5 stars!  All in all, it is one of the more expensive places I've been from an entree standpoint. $75 for an 8 oz and 3 scallops? It better be dynamite. It was very good, but maybe not enough for me to come back, considering the higher price compared to Mastro's, Capital Grille, et al. But my mouth is happy, so I'll give it 3 stars.",

The calamari was so tasty followed but perfectly cooked steaks and THEN! Kenny our waiter surprised us with the most fruitilicious strawberry shortcake after we hesitantly denied dessert. Couldn't resist the mountain of fresh strawberries and cream!! Seriously, go to Durant's, ask for Kenny and prepare to be rolled out the door after a deliciously gluttonous meal!",

The Gentleman working the valet at our hotel Recommended Durant's.    We showed up at 10:20 and we entered through the back.   Walked straight to the kitchen which gave us a mobster feel.   Main Entrance you walk through the kitchen.  Brilliant!    The courtesy and proper way they wait on you is like none we've encountered before.  MARCELLO was AWESOME.   Our water stayed filled up and they even came out to change the napkin in which our water was set on because it had picked up moisture.    AWESOME.   At this point we were already loving the restaurant.   Figured we would a good steak and call it a night...    we shared a rib eye (medium).   It was the BEST STEAK I have ever had.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   You will leave happy...   WE DID!",

Let me just tell you the experience was terrible! The 4 pieces of steak that we ordered separately were disgusting. One was charred so black it was inedible, the others were cold. We ended up sending 2 back only to have a less than appetizing replacement... to top it off we ALL left the restaurant very sick and my boyfriend & 2 friends ended up getting food poisoning.  I did call the restaurant as soon as they opened and spoke with the manager - who was less than helpful other than to tell us that he will \"pass the information on....\" what's that supposed to mean?  A very expensive dinner with little to no help when we left as sick as we did! Unacceptable! I am utterly disgusted and upset with this whole experience and lack of help after getting food poisoning.",

We almost turned around but luckily someone caught us and told us we were in the correct spot, lol!   Our waitress was so sweet and accommodating! Our food was cooked perfectly! I recommend the spinach artichoke dip, the chicken piccata, sweet potato fries, au gratin potato's and cheesecake!   Durant's has been open since the 40's so it had a really cool vibe to it. It's a classy place but many people were comfy classy (it is Az after all)!   Definitely check out Durant's for your next date night!",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday this year. I have to say this was one of the best steaks I've had in a very long while. As my friend described it to me, it has a very 1950s/ratpack/mobster feel to it. The entrance is by the kitchen so you go through it before you enter the dining area. The dining area is a low lit area with booths. The booths have red leather couches and the tables are covered with white linen. The servers very attentive, most of the time I need to ask for a water refill but I felt like my water was refilled almost unnecessarily here when I had only drank a third of the glass. If anything it's a good thing.   The food here, in particular the steak, is exceptional. We got the Oyster Rocketfeller which were very generous portions. My friend go the filet and scallops and I got the bone in ribeye. Most of the time I actually don't get ribeye anymore because it's too fatty. Not the case here. It's incredibly well marbled but with very little extraneous fat. It was purely marbled cow attached to a piece of bone. Incredibly flavorful and done to order.   The steaks came with a small dinner salad and a side of your choosing. I got their waffle fries which were a little less crispy than I would have preferred but still good.   If you're in the market for exceptional steak and price isn't a concern definitely come to Durant's. Great steak at a great establishment. Terrific for a special occasion.",

When we arrived there was ample spaces for parking, no need for the valet service. Atmosphere was \"Old school\", great feel., busy, tables filled and moderately loud.  Our waiter Craig introduced himself, we ordered drinks while reviewing the menu. I took advantage of the AZ Restaurant week menu: A glass of Red Wine, House salad, 12 oz. Prime Rib w/Mash Potatoes, Chocolate Indulgence Cake and Coffee, all for $44 (good deal). My dining partners ordered the Shrimp Cocktail and shared the 48 oz. Porterhouse.   Service was a little slow in the beginning, long wait to take out drink order and then long wait to place our orders, but then picked up after we did finally order. Steaks were done to perfection (needs more seasoning though), mash potatoes (not good). Relish Tray, Garlic Bread, Salads were all good. Dessert was very good.  Service good, food good, definitely worth going for the experience at least once.",

    "text": "So, it's not bad by any means. Apparently it's a great dinner spot judging by it's other rave reviews and awards. We only ate lunch and kept it simple so I can't comment on the steaks and such which are probably amazing as I'm sure are the desserts. Four of us ate, sticking to sandwiches--the turkey and avocado bacon for me, different burgers for two of us, a Reuben for the fourth. The sandwiches weren't bad--mine was pretty, pretty good. I had a bite of the burger my wife ordered and like her, agree it was great beef (but the bun was stale and there weren't any toppings on it to write home about). For sides we had a variety (fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad). All were---fine. However, none were worth the $15-$20 they charged. The decor is, again, ,okay-- (like my dining companion in his 60s mentioned it looked like it hadn't changed since the day he was born). Valet parking is mandatory (but free). So, I suggest you stick to dinner and go all out with steaks, desserts, drinks and plan to drop a few hundred. It's not worth the price for lunch, really, with so many great choices in Phoenix.",

It was dark with red leather booths and all of the servers were career servers, not college kids working their first gig. Our server and the various busboys were exceptional.  We never felt rushed and they only came by to make sure the table was cleaned of dishes and we weren't in need of anything.    We ordered the stone crab and mussels appetizers.  The stone crab was just ok, seemed a little small but may have been out of season.  The mussels were exceptional!  For dinner we ordered the calf's liver and onion and the ribeye steak.  It's hard to find calf's liver but if your a fan this place does it right.  Thinly sliced and smothered in onions and bacon.  The ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  Two things of note on the negative side.  This place is expensive!  The stone crab appetizer was $33.  Steaks ranged from $48 to $108.  Two Tito's vodka drinks at the bar were $18.  Having said that, this is quality dining where the atmosphere, service and the food is truly exceptional.  Then there was the hostess.  She was nasty.  Not to us but to the poor women that took us to our table.  She chastised her for not standing in the right place while we were ready to be seated.  She must have been an owner or a family member.  Other than that 30 second exchange the entire dining experience was fantastic.  Everyone should experience this place at least once!",

It's a charming restaurant.  I was a little concerned when the cab drive dropped me off in the rear.  I walked into the kitchen and they led me to the desk where the hostess was.  Apparently that's the correct entrance, because when I left, that's also the way they had me leave.  Kinda different.  The food and service was outstanding.  My waiter was wonderful.  He brought me out first a small vegetable platter.  It had celery, carrots, radishes, onions, and 3 huge black olives with ranch dressing to dip it in.    The Bread was HUGE and so yummy with garlic and butter running off of it.    I ordered the Ribeye steak and it was cooked to perfection.  I had a loaded baked potato to go with it.    All the desserts sounded awesome, but I was already stuffed to the max.  I definitely want to go eat here again.  Thanks to the Phoenix Yelper that told me about this place!  I highly recommend it!",

As it turns out, the party became more and more rowdy.  I don't mind people having fun... and I tried not to let it bother me.   Our server came up and asked if we would like to move because of the noise.  At first, I said no.  After a moment, I realized maybe it would be a good idea.  The manager came over, apologized, and quickly moved us to another room.  Our server was able to follow us.  Service continued to be excellent.   The manager came by to insure that we were taken care of.  I'm impressed by the fact that the team at Durant's went above and beyond by offering to move us (without being asked) and following up in such a 'caring' and professional way.   We love coming here for the food, service, and a relaxed \"on point\" atmosphere. Not too many places provide this kind of experience on a consistent basis.  Good job, Durant's!

This place has lost its class and still charges ridiculous prices.",

We came here for lunch and Governor Doug Ducey was there so we walked up to walk in and there stood secret service. Anyways I got the hot open beef mash potatoes and mixed veggies. It was okay, meat was tender I won't complain I love the ambience of the Resturant waitress and staff very attentive. Next time I might just stick to what I like best calamari and fish. The corn chowder soup was very good. It's a good experience with a $$$$ menu so be prepared and happy Eats! enjoy!",

    "text": "Durant's is a household name in the valley when it comes to steakhouses and fine dining; unfortunately our experience for my moms birthday the other night left much to be desired despite the $250.00 bill.   Starting with the positives, the atmosphere and ambiance is absolutely lovely and wonderful. The red velvet walls, gorgeous old fashioned red booths, and the overall charm of the restaurant cannot be beat; you will not find any place like it. The traditional environment takes you back to the good old days and leaves you feeling relaxed. We had a reservation and did not have to wait at all. the table was ready for us right away. Our waiter greeted us promptly and took our drink orders which came soon thereafter along with the crudite platter of beautiful celery, carrots, onions, and olives (best olive I have ever had). We studied the menu for a while and then decided to go with the prime rib/side salad/garlic mashed potatoes, large filet mignon/side salad/twice baked potato, ribeye/chili/garlic mashed potatoes, and onion rings. Once we ordered our waiter brought us the leek and butter garlic bread which was outstanding...holy smokes I could eat that all the time. It all went downhill after that...  We waited and waited and waited for our food to arrive. We also were without drinks for a long time on multiple occasions (we were drinking water and diet cokes, so it wasn't a bar drink we were waiting for). Our salads and chili arrived and they were very mediocre. Oh well, we had enough bread to tide us over until our real meal came. We waited and waited some more and finally our meat arrived. The prime rib was cooked well, but it was so chewy and rubbery that it was pretty difficult to eat. I am a prime rib aficionado, and this was definitely lacking in flavor and texture. The filet mignon was WAY too done; it was overly charred and close to burnt and tasted awful. The twice baked potato was over done as well and was difficult to eat because it was too hard. The ribeye however got decent reviews, but wasn't anything to write home about. The garlic mashed potatoes were good as well, but they weren't anything fantastic either. However the onion rings were crispy and flavorful.   For the steep price tag and reputation of Durant's we were expecting greatness both in food and service, but we were extremely disappointed and left wanting more. We all decided that we would much prefer Ruth's Chris, Flemings, or Capital Grill next time.",

It really brings you to another decade. I love it!   The food was really good. They give you complimentary garlic onion bread before your meal. It was a must try. the bread was so soft and garlic sauce tastes just right. Our first order was the clam chowder. I don't think I've had any chowder better than this! So many clams in there and the flavor was on point. For our entrees, we got the Friday special of fried cod fish and chips, iron steak over cord salad, and the pastrami burger which was recommended by the waiter on the regular menu. I tried all of the entrees and my favorite was the pastrami burger. It was so meaty and I am a meat lover so it just hits the spot. Oh and the fries that come with it was so crunchy!! My second favorite was the fried cod, it melts in your mouth! My least favorite was the Cobb salad with iron steak. I don't know what about it I didn't like, maybe it was just because it was a salad.",

This is a historical place where many stories could be shared by the walls, if only they could speak. The entry through the kitchen adds to the ambiance as if it were a tunnel through time to the past. We pictured mafia families sitting in the round booths speaking softly about 'operations' in the dimly lit room. We ordered the Ribeye steaks as well as sauteed mushrooms to share. 18 ounces of tender meat grilled to order and perfection. The mushrooms are a generous serving - an entire bowl of scrumptious delight!! They were a wonderful addition to the already delicious meal.  It was all too much to consume for these two hearty eaters. We both asked for boxes to go home.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.",

Like the real, completely working kitchen. The chef's and waiters and everyone wave and say hello. I thought it was very unique and definitely added to the experience.   The interior gives off an old-fashioned, velvet walls, leather booth, old-timey gangster vibe. It's super cozy and you can tell the interior hasn't changed much in the many years they have been there.  When you first arrive, they bring cold vegetables and ranch for the table. They were very fresh and delicious! We ordered drinks - first, a classic gin martini with an olive. I'll admit it was too much for me, but my family enjoyed it! I ended up ordering a lemon drop and it was fantastic.   After you place your order they bring over delicious bread with olive oil and some kind of herb/vegetable topping. I ordered the Catfish, but my mom and grandmother each ordered the big ribeye, and our other guests had the liver and onions and a large Caesar salad. We all enjoyed our meals and everything was cooked to perfection! The sides are hearty and flavorful as well.   For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brulee trio and WOOOOOW. There was a chocolate one, a berry one, and a classic one that honestly tasted like butterscotch to me. They were all fantastic and it was a great way to end a meal.   The service was friendly and nice, and the whole experience was very classy and enjoyable. It's definitely a pricey place so expect to spend a little extra here! They were also very accommodating with my grandma and her wheelchair which was super great.",

We ordered a shrimp cocktail to start and the shrimp were horrible. Rubbery pre-cooked shrimp. It was like biting into a chicken breast, not good. We were then served complimentary bread which was just stale bread drenched in a pool of olive oil to try to mask the lack of freshness. The salad was really really sad looking, not worth eating. For dinner, my date had a steak and I ordered shrimp scampi. Again, the same rubberized over cooked shrimp. I didn't even bother to eat one. The scampi was okay but nothing you couldn't find at Olive Garden. The steak was alright, nothing to write home about. Our server was also a joke..when my date asked for a wine suggestion to pair with his filet the servers response was \"I don't know, I have no clue what you like\". LOL. So overall, if this were a 40-60 dollar meal it would have been fine I suppose, but since our tab was 179.00 there's no way the quality matched the price. I guess they're relying on the traditional style decor to bring people through the door but I most certainly wouldn't be back.",

We got the creme brulee trio and it was epically delicious.   I had a lot of fun here, but I was grateful the check didn't come to me. Most items on the menu are around $35.

When we entered the sitting area it was like we where dumped into a scene it the Goodfellas with how the dim the lights where and with the seating arrangements. We where sat quickly and everyone that worked our table wished us a happy anniversary which I thought was a nice touch to the evening  The filet mignon was honestly the best I have ever had in my life. I had it cooked to medium and it would start to fall about just with my fork! It was very juicy and melted in my mouth with amazing flavor and perfect texture. The chef changed my view on how a steak should be cooked for ever! Megan had a delicious chicken mushroom dish with a very interesting sauce that was amazing. We finished our meal with some raspberry sorbet which was the perfect end to our meal.  The staff was amazing, they where quick and efficient. Megan I enjoyed watching them as they seemed to dance across the floor helping each other in perfect unison and loved the chemistry that is brought to the place to make everyone feel very important.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone and although it is not required, I recommend dressing up a little, men put on tie. I say this because it adds to the atmosphere and makes you feel like you are apart of the experience.",

If you enter through the back door, where the parking lot is, you'll get a glimpse of the bustling kitchen as you head into the main restaurant.     Sit at the bar or in the dining room - both are elegant and dimly lit and will provide full service.  Servers are always knowledgeable and service is always attentive here.  Make sure to order a drink while you glance over the menu - Duran'ts makes one of the best (and well-sized) martinis in town and has blue cheese stuffed olives.  They also have a nice wine list and a full bar.  Upon ordering your meal, you'll be presented with a small dish of crudite (carrots, green onions, olives, and celery, served on ice) to nosh on until your bread arrives:  a warm, crusty round loaf generously doused in garlic leek butter.  You won't know whether to dive in with your hands or a knife and fork.  Steaks here are always great and, unlike many of the newer steakhouses in town, are still served with soup or salad and your choice of side.  Durant's is also one of the best places in the Valley for liver - whether it be fried chicken livers as an appetizer or sauteed calves liver and onions as an entree.  The only disappointing item I've ever had are the oysters.  They're not the freshest or the most flavorful in town although the presentation is lovely  Skip the oysters in lieu of another of their delicious appetizers, or just enjoy the bread.  It really is that good.",

Instead, we waited way too long to order apps and meals, for drinks, and had to remind our blond waitress that we needed water refills. She also didn't take away the wine glasses from our cramped table after we told her we weren't drinking wine. It was waitressing 101 stuff that she missed. She gave us attitude when we reminded her of a drink order and said she'd get it when she went back there... As she proceeded to another table. She just was not friendly.  Now that I got that out of the way, the food was great! There were 4 of us and we ordered 2 steaks, seafood sampler and crab cakes. Everyone was happy with their food. We had the artichoke dip and crab Mac n cheese for appetizers and they were both delicious, highly recommend ordering them both.",

The garlic mash potatoes were good.  Since it was our first time there, our waitress offered us a \"special\" free dessert. Three types of creme brulee: Chocolate, Bailey's and Fresh Berries. Delicious, and not just because it was \"on the arm\".  Also, since we had four individual glasses of the same wine during the course of the evening, our waitress charged us the bottle price instead of the individual glass price, because it was cheaper.

They were very patient and accommodating to my grandparents who are in their 80s.  My grandma sent her entree back and they removed it from our bill.  Since it was my birthday, they paid for our dessert, too.  We ordered sliders as an appetizer.  They were good and reminded us of the cheap, grilled onion burgers we get at the fair back home.  My Washington Apple martini was also good.  No complaints there.  However, my shrimp were stinky, overcooked and over-seasoned.  That means that they served me old seafood.  Strike one.  I had the 8oz filet mignon steak, which was around $40.  It was average and slightly over-seasoned as well.  Strike two.  My stuffed baked potato was huge and incredibly filling!  Potatoes are pretty cheap to buy and cook.  I wish a little more imagination and flair went into the preparation of their potatoes.  In sum, Durant's is on the very edge of categorically good food for a comparable price.  It is my assumption that you could pay a few dollars more at another establishment and be served much better fare.  As it is, Durant's is at the unfortunate level of being simply average, while charging exorbitant prices for the experience and the charm.  Though, I still find it difficult to imagine being served a subpar entree for over $60, it still doesn't change the fact that this is what I experienced.  Yes, it is overrated, but still quite enjoyable and fun.    Durant's receives 3 stars for their drinks, their desserts, and their commitment to excellent customer service.",

Although there were only 4 pieces, they give new meaning to the phrase Jumbo Shrimp and, despite their size, they were not tough or iodine-y. The flavor was fresh and the cocktail sauce could clear the very worst sinuses!  The roasted garlic mashed potatoes must use REAL roasted garlic -- like, roasted in house, not just minced garlic tossed in! The sweet, earthy flavor was subtle which was perfect, because it didn't destroy your palate for the rest of the plate.  I was surprised by the wine list: not a huge. very accessible, relatively speaking.  But, we're on a quest for the best steak. This one? It gets very high marks!  Excellent seasoning on the meat. Preparation in terms of temperature was adequate (although, it was more on the medium rare side; I would argue that is the side to err on!).",

When we first arrived, we walked through the kitchen to get to the receptionist. We all thought we must have gone thru the wrong entrance. No...they later explained that they want their guests to see the people who cook our food (what a great idea). Kitchen isn't big but it is definitely clean and organized. I was very impressed. The restaurant is very dark in the inside, but its bright enough for you to see all the historic photos hanging on the wall right next to you or from a distance. From what I was told, this restaurant has been opened since 1960's. The elegant old school decoration is definitely appreciated. As we looked around, we've noticed that we were the youngest people on the table. Most guests are at least 40's and up. Perhaps most youngsters prefer fast food over dining at a elegant restaurant such as this. Or maybe because their food is relatively expensive lol. I've found that very interesting.   Shortly after we were seated, waiter, Patrick, came over to introduce himself. He knows the menu extremely well and told us about their specialty and their best items on the menu. The manager, Chris, came over and introduced himself multiple times. He was making lots of small talk with us to make us feel very welcome. The service here is definitely outstanding. The complimentary bread was covered with delicious sauce. The only reason I didn't finish it was because I was saving room for a steak. I ordered a 12oz slow roasted prime rib for my entree. It was so juicy and delicious. It was so tender that I could tear it off without cutting it with a knife. My friend ordered a rib eye and it was equally delicious. As for dessert, we all shared a strawberry short cake. That was my first time having it BTW....it has just the right amount of sweet and the strawberry wasn't too over powering. Every bite makes me feel like angels were dancing in my mouth. Oh yes it was that good.   We all left this restaurant happy and satisfied. If I could, I will come here everyday. If you are a meat lover and enjoy fine dining...you won't find another place better than this. 5 star all the way",

This just says tithe customer that \"we are the best, we have nothing to hide and see for yourself\". My wife ordered the Florida crab claws with the shrimp bisque and spinach salad. The claws were a little difficult to manipulate but were delicious. I had the New York strip, shrimp bisque and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly. We finished off our meal with the strawberry shortcake for two. Absolutely delicious and a must eat! My favorite steakhouse I have ever been to, a must go!",

She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey, I'm the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!  Entering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadn't read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend still swore I was lying and I pulled a fast one on her. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen, she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was \"it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with customers walking through all the time, huh?\"  I know, the way I think is weird.  The garlic bread was good. I generally don't like a bunch of \"crap\" on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this bread. I could have made a whole meal out of it (I've heard that from others).  The taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenomenal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings I've had on a steak to be honest.  I actually undervalued the bill too. I figured I'd be hit with a Delmonico's (Vegas) tab but it wasn't so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty. My alcoholic drink (Long Island) was also good as well as whatever fruity drink she had. Not too alcoholic, but still very tasty on both drinks.",

My buddy took me there for a birthday celebration and I am pretty sure I reviewed it..so I had to add this one.   I had the obligatory martini which was amazing per Durant's standards. Still wish you had the original glasses, but I guess rules are rules. Anyway, I just wanted a snack of sorts and ordered... drum roll... the barbecue chicken wings. A bit of honey barbecue actually and wow were those wings awesome. Might be the best I have ever had. First the wings were not a one little bit, over baked/fried bits. These wings, all six had plenty of meat to pull of. The sauce covering was delicious and boy did I savor every bite.   So the next time you just want a great martini (they by the way make all awesome drinks) and some tasty wings drop on by. You won't be the only one there trying this out.   I know, go figure...a place known for awesome out of this world steaks makes great chicken wings for appetizers. Who da thunk!",

I hate when we ask for a drink recommendation at other places and we hear \"I don't know, I'm not old enough to drink, Or we hear, I don't know me and my friends usually just order shots\".   The decor is hasn't changed since it opened 40+ years ago. There are no windows in this place and you enter from the back, though the kitchen. We have been here a few times and Durants has never disappointed. The complimentary relish tray is first to make it to our table. I think I can still taste the green onions on my breath. The calamari is some of the best we've had here in Phoenix. Very fresh. The salads are also some of the best we've had. We both had steak which was very good. We ordered a ton of food, however the pace at which they time the courses are perfect. Price is a bit steep we walked out dropping about $200. That included drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.",

This is the kind of place they'd use as a set for the Untouchables or Godfather.  Very cool classic decor.  No windows in the whole place.  Plenty of booths and good service.  Clearly Durant's has a lot of history.  The food was good in taste.  Prime rib was cooked very well and had good texture.

We start at Switch, head to Portlands, eat at Carly's, a drink at Amsterdam's and then as a night cap, the great big, giant, delicious, vivacious, stupendous shrimp cocktail at Durant's with one last Martini for the night.  Its like getting the kiss from your dream prom date as a junior in high school with the promise more action to come.  The drinks they make are always spot on and the bartenders are dressed up in vests and remind me of Lloyd on the Shining \"your money is no good here Mr. Torrence.\"  Lunch at Durants is exceptional, although pricey.  But any of the cuts of beef are extrordinary and the salads (Seafood Louie) are magnificent.  The bread that they serve has a delicious olive oil pesto type sauce on it that is smooth and buttery, it makes my waistline grow as we sit at the table. The atomic Horseradish that they have will leave you with no nose hairs at all, it is very strong and so hits the spot with any of the beef dishes and they put a dollop of it right square in the middle of your cocktail sauce with your shrimp cocktail.  If you have a little cash to burn, or want to impress a lunch or dinner date with good food in a historic Phoenix downtown setting, or if you want a nightcap with drinks that are worth the price, I recommend trying this place. If you go in though, do me a favor and imagine yourself riding down the hallway of an old swanky hotel on a big wheel, where the floor alternates wood and carpet.....this place is the Shining baby!",

    "text": "Flashback to the 70's....picture Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway, Tommy DeVito and Paul Cicero crowded close together in one of the red circular booths in a darkened corner. Can you see it? This is how I felt when I walked into Durant's the other night after seeing Brian Regan at the Dodge Theater.   Red velvet flecked wall paper, dark carpeting with a design straight out of a casino and bartenders in ties......this place was the bomb. Our waitress was professional, attentive and efficient. You can tell that some of the wait staff have worked here for years (but not like in that \"I work in a dive diner because I have no other choice\" way). These people CHOOSE to work here, and you can tell they love their jobs. This attitude comes through in how they treat their customers.   While I was not that hungry and only had a salad and baked potato, my dining companion ordered the fillet mignon, scallops and garlic mashed potatoes. When he said the scallops were the best he had ever tasted, I skewered one and gave it a try....the rush must be what heroin addicts feel when they shoot up for the first time. It was perfect! Although the fillet was tender, the flavor was a bit off; however even at less than 100% it beat most steak places hands down. My baked potato was anything but ordinary...twice baked and stuffed with cheese and other gooey goodness, it was a meal in itself.   For dessert we ordered the strawberry shortcake for two. When the waitress pulled up in the crane to drop it on the table, we realized this thing was really for five or six people, not two. The strawberries were covered in a sweet and light glaze, which did not soak through and make the short cake soggy (I hate that).   We ate in the dining room in front of the bar, which afforded us a delightful view of the incredibly diverse crowd that came in that night. It was both a culinary and visual delight.   The cherry on the top? Exiting through the kitchen. As I left I thought I could hear the faint sounds of \"Layla\" drifting through the air....or maybe it was my imagination.",

The entrance through the kitchen in the back is odd, especially when the smell of freshly-cooked food mixes with the unpleasant odor of dishes being washed.   The interior is old-line steakhouse, somewhat dark with lots of red light. It has a faded-jewel feel to it, but not in a good way. More tired than careworn, if you will. They bill themselves as fine dining, but it certainly was not based on design or presentation.  The waiter was personable, if a bit bombastic, but it was clear that the John Gotti-esque party of ten seated next to us was the bigger tip and would get the lion's share of the attention. That was a shame because we were there for the experience and at least two of the three of us are generous tippers.  I ordered the Durant's 20-oz Delmonico with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, my friend Bruce the 8oz filet mignon. My steak was good, but not memorable. Bruce found the filet mignon to be very pleasant.  In sum: the decor was deadly boring/worn, the service punctual but perfunctory, and the food good but not an 'experience' as Durant's was billed. If I lived in Phoenix, I would not be back. When I return next year, I will pass it by.",

We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters (served on ice-cold black rocks), porterhouse steak (melts in your mouth), scallops, mesquite grilled shrimp, and my grandpa had chicken livers (though I've never tried them, I don't recommend them). My hubby and I shared a 4-layer chocolate cake consisting of a thick icing on top, two layers of mousse, and a moist cake atop a swirl of raspberry sauce.   Needless to say, neither my hubby nor I could drive, due to his enormous gin martini and my indulgence on the wine. The servers didn't mind that we sat a while after the check was paid. No pressure to turn tables here. Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for a delicious meal.",

We were pleasantly surprised by the back kitchen door entrance and the old fashion decor.  Complimentary bread was a plus with amazing butter herb sauce. You can taste the basil, the leek, and the onion... with lots and lots of butter. It was delicious!  Between the four of us, we had NY steak, Filet Mignon, and Rib Eye steaks. As tasty as the quality of beef was, it wasn't the best I have had and wasn't worthy of the $50 dollars that I paid for.  (Thought their garlic mash potato was a must try!)  We were also surprised how my friend's median NY steak are just as raw as my rare Rib Eye. We weren't able to get our waitress' attention during most the meal though she walked by our table a few times. I think he would enjoy his meal a lot better if he could have his steak done right.  The booth are also definitely designed for skinny figure individuals... We were almost elbow to elbow with one another.  I wouldn't mind going back with other friends, but I probably won't try the place again on my own. As my three stars indicated, it really was just \"A-OK!\"",

Very romantic and comfortable.  Tip-you enter through the kitchen, NOT through the front door. Once inside, the staff seats you, brings you cocktails, and all is well.  We sat in the bar (Tip-table 51 or 52 are the best). We had steak, Caesar Salad, stuffed baked potato and a tomato salad. An old school meal, over the top good, served perfectly not hurried and not too slow. Dining perfection.  All in all a top dining experience.

Prime Rib was awesome! Garlic mashed potatoes too! We have never had a problem with service - they have always been almost too nice!  They even comped dessert because it was our 10th anniversary! You can't ask for more!  You will spend cash here but, for my money it's way better than Ruth Chris, Flemings, etc.",

The bread they give you in the beginning is amazing. It is served with a leak, shallot and butter mixture that is so delicious.  But my rib eye was loaded with salt and a little tough for the cut of meat.  Overall a nice atmosphere for drinks but over priced food.",

    "text": "When visiting Phoenix we were so excited to find some unique place that locals call their own and all arrows were pointing to Durant's. So we went! When we pulled up, I was not sure if it was a shady front for the ol' Mob gentlemen of Phoenix or really a dry-cleaner/strip club - being adventuresome we continued in! Seemed though we walked through the wrong end of the restaurant because there was a fairly well dressed man that I believe to be the Maitre'd questioned us immediately with an Adam's Family type tone........Do you have reservations? Apparently for over 65 years tradition you enter from the kitchen, I would have never known. There was no one in the restaurant at this point but a cute lil ol couple sitting in the back with dim candles lit - I started to feel a lil Doris Day'ish, so we continued. We were seated, in the \"only\" available seat for the evening. The seating was uncomfortable with a tiny table for two which sided to the typical red velvet half moon booths that were against every wall. I honesty expected a Sopranos star at this point to come in and tell us what the special was. When we were offered the menus we about fainted. A salad, which was not included in your meal was $15.00 and simple 8oz steak with fries no-less was $40.00.....also a nice touch the friendly reminders on every page of the menu, that there is no cell phone use allowed at this restaurant At this point, this when my lover's eyes met mine and we ran like hell. We just knew this place was not for our pocket book nor the experience we were searching for on that particular night. Maybe we will meet Durant's again one night.............",

I love the classic feel of this restaurant - the staff is friendly, super polite, and polished in their bow ties. They were attentive without being overbearing.  He had a filet with garlic mashed potatoes and a small wedge salad. He devoured that steak. I had the salmon with mango glaze (nice kick without overpowering the fish) and a baked potato. We ordered a size of lobster mac and cheese for the table that was to die for. We finished off the meal by splitting a slice of cheesecake - so so good!",

    "text": "I wish I could give Durant's 3.5 stars.    My business colleague and I had dinner there last night based on a recommendation from a friend.  Neither of us lives in Phoenix, but we're there regularly on business and both of us were hungry for a high end steak.    The good part:  The food is excellent!  I had a New York strip and my colleague had a filet.  Both steaks had excellent flavor and although a tad heavy on the salt, were properly seasoned and presented.  The sides were also good and the bread was just amazing.  The service is very good, but not outstanding; one thing I REALLY appreciated were the discrete signs asking patrons to refrain from cell phone use in the dining room - THANK YOU for that!   The okay part:  My entree was $58 or so and my two mixed drinks were $12 / each.  Pricing of this level should be accompanied by outstanding service and better presentation.  Case in point:  The flatware, silverware, and glassware were Outback Steakhouse quality, nowhere near high end; for nearly $100 including a tip, I expect to be drinking from cut crystal bar glasses and using high quality silverware.  Lastly, the dining room itself was not consistent with the expectations of the typical high end steak patron.  More on that below.    The reason it only gets three stars:  The dining room is marketed as a throwback to an old mob restaurant - 'Goodfellas' or the Sparks Steak House where John Gotti whacked Paul Castellano.  It's also portrayed as a historic setting that looks almost exactly the way it did when it opened in the 1950's.  Well, not exactly........  I LIKE the old look of the red velvet wallpaper and some of the decor, but the rest of the dining room really needs work.  The carpets are worn and don't look real clean, the acoustic ceiling tiles look dirty, the lighting is bad, and most importantly - the dining room is a giant, wide open space.  If I were the owner of Durant's, I would incorporate some booths along the walls of the dining room that were semi-enclosed so couples or those wanting to have a private conversation could have that much needed personal space.  I would ditch the old carpets.  I would make the lighting more intimate, and I would impose some level of a dress code.  I realize patrons are rightfully valued by the amount of money they're going to spend, but the night I visited Durant's, there were a number of patrons wearing old shorts and flip flops.  If you want to charge a high end price, you have to provide a high quality product - which Durant's DEFINITELY does - and package it in a high end setting.    If you're looking for a really good steak and don't mind paying for it, Durant's is fine as long as you don't expect a high end setting.",

My companion was served an 8 oz dry, cold prime rib at $34.00....again with the gluey mashed potatoes. Please skip this very bad upscale tradition.  Phoenix has so much more to offer   After this review, Durant's sent me a full refund with apologies.  I was very pleased so I added 2 stars to my original one star review.",

Sides were mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Starters were house salad, ceasar  salad and soup (leek potato or some such thing).  Salads and soup were somewhere between ok and real good.  Sides, other than the onion rings were unremarkable.  Steaks were both good.  Sliders are sliders.  Crab cake was meh at best, a total miss at worst.  Service and ambiance (I'd classify it as french whore house chic) were ok.  Since the meal clocked in at just under $300 (w/tip) I'm just not sure the cost to quality ratio was right.  It's an interesting place to take an out of towner but I think in the future I just tell folks about the place and then go elsewhere.  Probably a 2.5 but that's not a choice so I rounded up.",

The cocktails were great.The real highlight of the night besides all that wonderful food and drink was our server, Lonnie. It was our 49th wedding anniversary and our friend's 53rd.

    "text": "After 18 years in the valley, we finally made the trek down to Durant's.  First, I will preface my review by stating that we did not stay for dinner. Long story short, we bailed after they brought out the bread basket.   Cutting to the chase....  Cons:  * Entering through the kitchen isn't the best marketing strategy when your kitchen really needs a remodel. * The entire place needs one of those remodeling shows to do a surprise make over. * Carpeted restaurants leave your customers wondering just how dirty that carpet is. * A bar tender should know the wine list, or at least be able to muddle through a question about a bottle of wine. * Bath rooms are a bit tired and need a remodel. * Wait staff needs some training, a tad way to \"Denny's casual\" for us. * Bread basket and vege plate need some work. If I am dropping 300 bucks for 2 people, pick up the level a bit. * Small detail, but the wine glasses and glass wear need to be updated. Nothing worse that drinking a 150 bottle of wine out of a Denny's type glass. Silver wear is also right out of an institution.   Pro's:  * Wine list was pretty good, with allot of great wines and reasonably priced too.  I am sure we are going against the grain here with this review, but its simply how we see it. We typically have in our steak house rotation, Mastro's, Ocean Club, Bourbon Steak (Michael Mina's place), and Morton's, this place just isn't in that league. While I will admit we never even got to the dinner, I simply made a judgment call that with all that we had seen up to ordering, the food would not have been that good to over come all the cons. If your a 30, 40's or even 50's couple looking for a hip crowd and great atmosphere, note to self... this aint it.  I am not a huge food critic. To me it is more important to have a great atmosphere, fun hip crowd. I get the whole \"oldest power lunch steak house\" thing, but eventually even the greats need to earn their keep through something other than their long lived reputation.",

The waitress was absolutely terrible! You can really tell she hates her job. The food? I asked what the USDA grading was on the steaks and never really got a clear answer, which tells me that it isn't \"Prime\"; the taste and texture confirmed it. I eat at Prime Steakhouses at least once a month. From Felmmings to Del Frisco's to Elway's in Denver and a quality piece of beef is at last some compensation for the cost. I won't get into that argument right now... but paying those prices for lesser cuts is just plain wrong.  Message to Durant's: Get a makeover! The restaurant and the food both need one badly. I understand there are very slim margins in the restaurant business, aside form the bar, but at least have enough pride in your establishment to give your patrons what they are coming in for.",

My father loves steak and while I was growing up it was always steak, steak steak, every meal all the time. I got to the point if you offered me a steak, I would have to go an meet a new probation officer.  Steak annoys me. A giant piece of meat? Really?  I don't like giant servings or giant things given to me with the expectation of me eating them as if I'm a contestant in some crazy meat-eating contest. The only things that I think that are better when you increase the serving size are cocaine and bourbon.  But, I have to say, I ordered the Delmonico and I loved it. It was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Delmonico because I liked the way it sounded -- old school. \"Give me the Delmonico and a bourbon.\"  I liked saying that.  And the waiter was very attentive and the buser was also right on top of things. The valet was good too.  I wish we could have sat at the bar, but it was packed. We had to sit at a table in the main room. The lights above us were so bright I confessed to three crimes before I caught myself.  DIM THE LIGHTS FOR GOD'S SAKE!",

They are known for their Steaks, Shrimp cocktail and the perfect martini. I would also recommend their Key Lime pie.",

    "text": "For me, Durant's is a drinking bar.  Not only is the menu unappetizing and contrived (to me!), but the flavors are blah.  Not bad, but blah.  I realize that their aim is to remain classic, chic, simple and distinctly American, so the things that I dislike about the menu are not exactly a deduction in my mind.  In other words, don't go there expecting artisanal, innovative food selections.  Expect steak, potatoes, and incalculable calories.  The drinks, however, are impeccably good.  The bartenders are career bartenders.  I've been going to Durant's for about 9 years, and it's usually the same two faces every time.  They are not overtly warm to everyone, and I feel that your chances of getting sassed by them are much higher if you are a younger person, but most of the time they're nice.   The bar is warm and cozy to me, I love the dim lighting, the famous decor, and the mingled scents of meat and coffee remind me of my grandmother's kitchen.    The assortment of people is fascinating, but there's always one sloppily wasted lawyer or other downtown denizen shouting about his divorce or John McCain to bring you down.  Ignore him.",

Waiters were quick with the refills and we didn't have to wait too long for our food.  I ordered the Top Sirloin steak and it was delicious. I recommend the garlic mashed potatoes, very tasty. I also got a complementary dessert for my birthday: I LOVED the Fruit Crisp a la mode. My parents shared the ribeye and they loved it as well.  Overall I'd definitely go here again.",

    "text": "With a mobster feeling upon entering through the kitchen, red leather booths, red velvet wallpaper, and my friend telling me how popular this place was for politicos back in the day, my imagination ran away with me picturing Durants full of politicians and their beautiful wives getting totally smashed on martinis and smoking their cigarettes looking bored while the men talked politics.   So in the spirit of the restaurant I decided to order the vodka martini and holy cow did I get hammered. Now, I have to be fair and admit that I am not one to hold my liquor and it probably didn't help that I had 5 glasses of wine before I went, but the martinis here- although good, are lethal. If someone had lite a match next to me I probably would have combusted.   My friend and I couldn't decide on a main entree so we decided to order 3 appetizers. The crab cake- VERY good, the spinach dip- also good, but similar to most places, and the seafood sampler- oysters and shrimp were good but the crab was obviously frozen and tasted horrible.   We told our waiter that the crab was bad, and he commented that the crab wasn't in season until the end of the month- which we understood, but were still disappointed that it was even on the menu. We had eaten the shrimp and oyster 1st wanting to save the crab for last and immediately sent it away when we tasted it. Truthfully, it made me sick to my stomach- or maybe it was the liquor that did it. Anyways, the manager came out and said he was going to comp us over $20 for the crab. That was very decent of him, although I am pretty ruined from trying the crab here ever again. I think I will probably play it safe by ordering the chicken or steaks next time.   I left Durants with a smile on my face and a stumble in my step. A little lighter in my pockets- this place is pricy, but Overall, a great night.",

    "text": "Oh Man. This is not the place I imagined I would assign my first 2-star rating. I woke up as sad and disappointed as I felt last night, leaving the legendary, old school Durant's after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service. Sigh.  Honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner. We saw Durant's listed on Restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bow-tie clad staff and velvet wallpaper. The instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience. Shall I fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prix-fixe menu? Perhaps.  Our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night. Watching the bartender mix the martini's the way my Pops used to was nostalgia at its best. I LOVED that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese. That is brilliant. It could transform me into a beer drinker after all. We met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening.  Moving on to the booth, our waitress was definitely in the weeds. Having been in her shoes before, I always try and accommodate the situation. We ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able. Appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy. Tortillas and garlic bread and warm, cheesy dip delivered promise.  The limited menu was just that. Okay first course salad/soup options. Main course offered Pot roast, a small steak or chicken fried steak. Stewed steak, grilled steak or fried steak. Really? Your menu is impressive...if you really don't want to participate in Restaurant week, then don't.   Honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option. J ordered the cfs too.   Food took a bit, but we had good conversation flowing, so it wasn't a problem. Salads and soup were fine. Main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak. I guess when you think of this meal from the past, it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy. This steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravy-esque goo on the top. Garlic mashers were appropriately placed.   My trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish. The trout was pain-fried and should there have been a light sauce, it would have been good. But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good.   The fried steak too, so not good. Mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness, but you really don't want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner.   We were devastated.  The whole experience was so not what we came for or expected. I do want to give Durant's another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many, but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen.",

    "text": "I know this makes me un-Arizonan but I am not a fan of Durants.   the husbands family loooooooooooves this place, so I find myself here at least once a year.   So right now its Durants 60th anniversary, and they are giving out free dessert for LIFE tokens. My in-laws are out of town and begged us to go eat dinner (on their dime) to pick up these dessert tokens. So we went this past Sunday.   We had a reservation and were seated right away. The one thing I LOVE about this place is the atmosphere. It is AMAZING, its dark, romantic, and has that amazing 50's vibe I love.   The food is what gets me. For the price you are paying you would expect something fantastic, and it NEVER is.   The salad they bring you is some mixed greens, **maybe** five croutons, and a couple pieces (and by a couple I mean 3 or 4) pieces of very very small diced cucumber overloaded with salad dressing.   The New York Strip has always been over cooked (I ask for it medium it comes out with no pink at all) chewy and full of grizzle and lacking flavor.   The garlic mashed potato's are spot on. But its mashed potato's, you cant really screw those up (unless you're my mom)   The desserts are generally fantastic, on this night we split the creme bruele trio and they were smooth and creamy.   I guess its the price that gets me, for the quality of food you are getting. For 2 people with no Apps or alcohol ordered, our bill with tip was $115. That is OUTRAGEOUS for a poor quality steak. I would rather go to Ruth's Chris where it is always perfect.   Sorry Durant's.",

    "text": "We've long heard about this restaurant, but frankly we don't dine in expensive steak houses all that often. Last time, I made the mistake of going to a Ruth Chris (Anaheim) and having a real disappointment. Here, the prices are about the same (high) but you get an experience to go along with it.   As others have stated, we walked through the kitchen to enter the restaurant and WOW what a clean place that was, filled with cheerful workers who greeted us as we walked in. I felt like Frank Sinatra when I walked through their kitchen - it was certainly a flashback to a better, earlier day.   The wait staff was fantastic - guys in white jackets moved aside for my wife as she walked in, making her feel like a special lady. Our server, Patti, gave us her business card. How often do you get a business card from a server? She TRULY cared about her guests. There were large bouquets of fresh flowers everywhere, even in the ladies room. There was a pay phone in the ladies room -- a real blast out of the past when ladies had to use a phone to get out of the occasional bad date.   The food was even better than the great atmosphere and staff. My wife's filet was perfectly cooked and my Prime Rib was the largest, juiciest slice of meat (about an inch and a half thick) that I've had in years. Really, really good food that we are still talking about a day later. We'll be thinking/talking about this meal for a long time.  Make sure you order their Key Lime Pie or their Signature Strawberry Shortcake. Both were superb. My son and I also enjoyed the bread with special garlic, basil and leek treatment. Wow.  Thank you Durant's for making our 35th anniversary so special! We will be back soon, I'm sure.",

The booths were red as was the wallpaper but I liked it. I thought it was romantic. The food was also great! The steaks were cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the Chilean wine we chose. In addition, the price of the meal was fair. Each dinner comes with a salad and potato/rice and relish tray included in the price. Not True at Mastro's City Hall, Capital Grille, J&G Steakhouse and Ruth Chris where nothing is included and you must purchase each and every side item you order. And finally, the service was excellent. Our server was friendly and very attentive. We had a wonderful experience and you can bet that this will be one of our go to places.",

This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...can't vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red \"leather\"? booths are welcoming. It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent.",

I've been to most of the other high-end steak/seafood restaurants in the valley and others can't compare because you get so much more for your money spent at Durants. Example, an entree at Durant's INCLUEDS a soup/salad AND a choice of potatoe. Remember getting sides with your dinner?..just like in the old days. You will pay extra for ANYTHING else on your plate at the other high-end restaurants in Phoenix. The coffee is very nice (maybe Italian roast?) and the desserts are amazing.  I wrote this review because it was my fourth visit to Durant's and we always have a great experience here. If you want great food with a pricing structure that doesn't insult you, pay this charming little restaurant a visit.",
