    "text": "Me and my husband went here last Saturday for an early dinner. There was a short wait of about 15-20 minutes not that big of a deal since you could eat peanuts out of the barrel. We were seated and the service my our waitress was pleasant and fast. My husband ordered a chicken salad and I ordered the 6oz sirloin well done. When our food arrived his salad was fine but when I cut into my steak it was red. No slightly pinkish brown but the whole middle was red. I kindly asked the server if they could take it back and provide me a steak well done. She assured me that she told the kitchen the right thing so it wasn't that she made a mistake. So I kept my potato and nibbled on that while I waited for my steak to come back. Minutes later and my potato finished my steak comes pretty black and shriveled with the same piece I had cut off and examined. Here's my thing... I believe when something leaves the kitchen that it should NEVER return and then be placed back on the grill. When we politely addressed the issue of obtaining a new steak the cook took it back with a tiny bit of resistance after trying to explain that it was fine to just eat the steak. Once my new steak came out it looked amazing. It wasn't blacken for it to be well done and it was juicy. I was taken back a little when the manager came out to deliver it and when we explain to him our concern about placing food back on the grill he just stated that they ask and do that sometimes when people don't want to wait for another one to be cooked. We were never asked and I told him that. He never once apologizes for the mistake made and didn't seem concerned at all. Maybe I am making a big deal out of this but I could have touched the steak with my hands or couched, sneezed, or licked what have you.... And then it would have been thrown back on the grill with everyone else's food who was eating that night. Turns my stomach and I wish that the customer service was better for the manager to take some responsibility and ownership. Oh and in case you were wondering we payed for the full meal and we won't be going back to this location anymore.",

You have no chance of losing anything (maybe your boyfriend or husband) if you come here with any regularity.   Remember the name of the place? Texas Roadhouse? Well these folks take pride in serving 'Texas' sized meals. Which for the normal person should put them about two meals ahead of their eating schedule.   Service was friendly and fast. Food was superb. And judging by the looks of the women in this place, they have no clue we'll be in triple digits in about 90 days, relegating them to a nice big onesy at the pool  this summer.  Nice job TR. I enjoyed my pulled pork. Fried pickles, salad, and bucket 'o peanuts.  I thank you.

The atmosphere is a fun one, the bread basket with honey-whipped cream was delicious, however, I had to stop myself from eating it all by myself, because, I started to eat more low carb. But it was really yummy! The peanuts in a bucket seating on the middle of the table was our welcome to the place, really neat! I ordered the \"Roadkill\" platter, with a cup of chili and a Caesar salad. The salad was good, and it came with an extra item, a mini MARSHMALLOW!! I don't know why? But I didn't mind at all, it was just funny! The chili was good too, and the roadkill, which was ground chuck steak with mushrooms and onions was good, the flavor of the mushrooms was really good, but the size of the onions were too big, and they were not cooked through, so it had a strong raw flavor to me. And I don't hate onions. Our waitress treated us very good, always minding our empty glasses, and was never in a hurry to turn our table.  Kudos for the wait staff!",

    "text": "I have been to many different locations of Texas Roadhouse over the years and had pretty good experiences. Last night this location was just okay. Upon walking in there was an extremely loud country song playing (to the point of not being able to talk over each other) and it turns out the employees were doing a line dance in the middle of the restaurant. I do know that Texas Roadhouse employees do participate in various line dances throughout the night but this location is particularly \"enthusiastic\" about it. Maybe Saturday nights are country nights? Not sure? But quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing.  My fiance and I were seated in a very small two person table in the back corner of the restaurant next to a party of at least twelve. Our waitress did come over right away and greet us and our drink orders were promptly served. We did find a mystery substance on one of the rolls we were served which was somewhat branch like, maybe a stem of some kind. We ate the other rolls in the basket which were still good and warm. Service was good despite being right next to a very large party. The noise level was quite ridiculous. I also a had a three to four year old child directly behind my seat who was in the most shrill way possible screaming in my ear throughout our dining experience. Yay great way to spend the evening. The Texas Roadhouse birthday announcement was done a total of four times while we there (lots of birthdays last night I guess). It is tolerable maybe once but NOT four times. It goes a little like this - ATTENTION TEXAS ROADHOUSE IT IS (insert name here) BIRTHDAY TONIGHT AND THEY ARE TURNING (insert age here) CAN I GET EVERYONE IN THE PLACE TO GIVE A BIG YEEEEEHAAAAAW!! The party next to us was particularly intoxicated and just about blew my ear drums out with every yeehaw given. After 4 of these I was going a little insane. I needed a shot of vodka stat.  The food was okay. Not bad. The steak that I had was good. Cooked just right and tender. My salad was meh and my fiance's ribs were a little dry. I have had better Texas Roadhouse experiences in the past. This location is particularly lively. If you enjoy shrill screaming children, drunk obnoxious diners screaming yeehaw multiple times throughout the night and extremely loud country music with line dancing in the middle of the walk way, this is your place. I had never been to a Texas Roadhouse quite like this one.",

Well it turns out she knew the people at one of the tables because she spent a lot of time talking to them. By the time our food got to the table, our drinks were empty. She left them empty, she asked if we needed something else, we told her what we needed, she was gone for at least 10 minutes and came back with nothing. My husband had to take all of our empty cups to the bar for a refill. My steak was over cooked but that wasn't my biggest complaint, it was Anna our \"server\" she was horrible.",

I thank my lovely waitresses who's name escapes me right now :( for letting me know it would be cheaper to order it that way instead of how I was a going to order. I ended up only eating the salad and taking everything else, along with about 4 rolls home with me.

I looked around and saw a layer of dust on all the lamps.. also on the tops of the booths. I could run my fingers along the edge of the booth and get a thick layer of dust on my finger. It was disgusting! It made me hesitate to even finish the food thinking if the dining area was this unkept, imagine the kitchen!

It took us reminding her about about the beers until she brought them.. The server was ILENE (horrible). When she brought our order 1 was supposed to be Oven Roasted half chicken with ribs and she brought out Grilled Chicken breast. When I told her the order was wrong she told me \"Oh we're out of that chicken\" and she gave me no option to send it back or to even ask if I wanted something else. Also my whole family (4) ordered a cup of chili and when she brought it out we asked for spoons her response was \"I don't think we have any\" and she never came back with clarification if they \"had\" spoons. About 40 minutes later we reminded her if she ever checked for any spoons. She said \"let me check, I don't think so.\" I said \"I'm sure you have spoons somewhere.\" When she finally brought the spoons our chili was already cold. Mind you this was around 920pm and they close at 11pm. When the two that got beers asked for another one she said \"it's last call\" (@ 930PM). WTFFFF!?!?! When finally brought the second round of beers one asked for lime and her response was \"They threw them away...\" Without any ATTEMPT to find one. The last annoying thing she did was ask me if we wanted cups for our DRINKS to go and we said \"Yes\" this lady brought out To Go Containers for SOUP. (like are you kidding me).  By far, the most unpleasant experience I've ever had with a waitress. She will definitely make me think twice before coming back. AGAIN THAT WAS ILENE FROM TEXAS ROADHOUSE ON 75th & MCDOWELL.",

The best thing about Texas Roadhouse that beats out their competition is the food is made in house, the steaks are cut in house and the service is personalized. For the money it's a better choice for a cheap night out for steak.",

She couldn't get a sweet potato if her life depended on it. It finally came, after we finished, and then a second sweet potato came out and we already had one sitting there. All of the staff was helpful and courteous to us, but they just missed out on the details. Management has issues in the kitchen. Hopefully they will get them fixed before we drive 3 hours from the White Mountains to enjoy a steak.",

The service was absolutely horrible, not to mention the facility wasn't very clean (see the photo of the shelf next to our table). Our server must have forgotten our order as it took way too long to get our food (close to an hour). The table that sat down next to us had their food before we even got our salads. The drinks took a very long time to get and refills were pretty much nonexistent. We never got additional dinner rolls that we asked for numerous times and the food quality was subpar to other locations I've been to. I wanted to leave a very small tip but was talked out of it by my better half. I felt compelled to ask to speak to a manager but we were on a time crunch since we were attending a concert at the nearby Ak Chin Pavilion. We won't be visiting this location again any time soon.",

    "text": "Though I've had some decent food at Texas Roadhouse out of the area, this location, unfortunately, did not do well the several times I went there for lunch or dinner.  Service was great, or at least our waitress had an amazing nice shaped arse which made up for some of the otherwise poor dining experience.   On to the food - wifey ordered a steak and it was so tough she couldn't chew it. We were going to send it back but it took them too long to notice -- on the plus side, they took it off our bill and apologized. Thanks +1 star for that.  There are TVs on, not loud. There is music, also not so loud, it's just overall loud as hell  and I don't mean because of the constant barge of yeehaws or call/response for birthdays.  I don't know if it's bad acoustics or what, but if I were a sound engineer I'd map that place out, then do something to dampen the noise.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare. On the plus side, it was cooked perfectly. However, although these are hand picked and carved, I guess they cut corners better than meat, or maybe the chef missed this was about half fat which I had to trim off, along with stringy parts I wasn't able to cut.  Evidence of a bad slice left for the waitress to see, she got a good look but stayed silent as she removed my plate at the end. Not a question \"Did you enjoy your steak? Was it cooked well? Did it taste ok? Was it a bit too fat?\" None of that. -1 star there.  Drink menu has a few fruity cocktails and margaritas, beer selection awful unless you like commercial lager/pilsner in a frozen glass, then go ahead. They were out of the seasonal Sam Addams brew so Boston Lager was the thing and it tasted stale, also served in a chilled mug. I happen to like the taste of beer, don't mask it with ice cold containers please.  For a steakhouse, some darker brews compliment the meat. (Point here: Texas Roadhouse doesn't have them). Try a Guinness or a porter, really. Room temperature glass. You'll thank me. You're welcome. Every other bar in the area has at least a few locally produced ales and usually given in a proper glass. It's a science like wine, different shapes for different tastes. Keep the cans of cheap beer for hot summer days where you don't care how many or how often you drain them. Nuff said.  Parking is decent though at times odd because of the way these places are right angled along 75th, you may have to circle around or use adjacent parking for Desert Sky Mall.   Tip: They have lunch/early dinner specials so come earlier to get in on that or for when it's less crowded.  Note to management or brand owners: I really really want to like Texas Roadhouse, and not just for the cute staff. Please fix the problems with the food and the beer selection, so we can enjoy the full experience like a Texas Roadhouse is supposed to be.",

My wife and I just moved to Phoenix and we are huge fans of Texas Roadhouse, the moment we walked in one of the servers refused to serve us due to it being the end of her shift. That is very unprofessional, most of these people get paid by the hour and you cannot refuse service to someone just because your shift is almost over. I work in fast food and although I am ready to go home an hour before my shift, if a customer walks in a minute before I close the door I have to serve them. If you want control of your own schedule, become your own boss.",

However the food is hit or miss for me I've been here a total of five times and on two of those occasions my steak was cooked properly. It's very frustrating because new go to a steakhouse and order a steak a specific way you expected to come out in the way you ordered it. I ordered a steak twice medium rare and one time it came out nearly raw, and when I mean rawI mean almost on cooked in the second time my steak him out closer to medium well or well. I come back here because my family when they travel and likes this place. But I wonder how much longer will keep going there if they continue to make these mistakes",

However, my prime rib was very rare even though I ordered it medium. I didn't think it would be a big deal. They took it back and I expected it back quickly. My husband was halfway done with his burger and my steak was still not back. The server came back twice to inform me it should be out soon but it wasn't.  My husband literally finished his meal when my prime rib arrived looking like it has been ran over and later burnt. It looked black and gray. It smelled old and could I barely cut into it. They also forgot my baked potato when they brought my plate. Overall, I expected for the manager to come over and apologize for the long wait. I took that one bite and asked for a to go box. No discount, no customer service. The place was nearly empty and the cooks should have made a better attempt at cooking my steak. So much for a quick lunch.",

Unless he makes more in tips with less drama, then do what you do Sheldon.   Five stars because I've had tequila and my steak was insane and Sheldon was a total boss. I'll come back maybe. Phoenix is a happening spot!  Please mail me some bread and cinnamon butter. K thanks. #drunkyelping",

The steak was seriously one of the best steaks Ive had.  It melted in my mouth.  I felt like I was at a high end steak house...minus the bucket of peanuts on the table and the servers randomly yelling Hee Haw lol.  It was fun!!! The warm rolls with the cinnamon butter was also a treat!!! If I lived in Phoenix, that would be a regular go to place for sure!",

    "text": "I would have given it FIVE STARS- but removed TWO stars for the server, service. Usually I get their dinners for pickup/take out only. I really enjoy the food, it is quite good and never have had a bad meal.  My first Dine In experience is my LAST dine in experience, ditto for my diner-mates, as it was their first T.R. experience and they were turned off.  First, we (three adults) were seated in the \"Noisy loud children and families\" section and in the VERY furthest seating all the way to the back and in a corner. We were not asked where we would like to be seated, and whether this seating was fine (it was not).  The ambience: depressing. The very large and loud family seated next to us (no fault of the restaurant of course) after finishing their meal, got a To-Go box and literally scraped every last crumb, crust, and condiment left on plates into the boxes to take home. I noticed another table unrelated was doing the same- I mean scraping off every little crumb.   Our server was a way too familiar. She spoke to us as if we were close friends and often interrupted our tables conversations without asking for her advice or help.  Our table was in the midst of deciding what to order while our server waited beside us (we're fast orderers by the way, I already knew what I wanted) I urged my friend to \"get their mashed potatoes and brown gravy, they're dreamy\" the server then butted in and said she (and I quote) \" I mixes [sic] up my mashed potatoes and the rice together and eat it up, it's so goooood\"  ... I told my friend \"well, this is the first time I've ever been repulsed from ordering something on the menu, by the waitress!\" We received our dinners just fine, everything was fine. Server comes back- \"is everything ok?\" Yes, yes everything's fine.. Waitress : It's GOOD, huh?!\" she pronounced \"good\" like \"geeeuuud\". and nodded her own head up and down at us energetically.   The whole atmosphere of the place, and the server, gave our table a sad and pathetic feeling, like we were there just to get \"filled up\" and were lucky not only were we receiving food, but LOTS of it.  Just sad and I felt dirty and icky when we left. Dining is supposed to be a fun, happy and better experience than what you get at home, not lower.  What's bad is, Texas Roadhouse probably will have no idea that their servers are like this, and probably won't care they lost at least two diners. Me, I will continue to order, but only TO GO orders, never dine in.",

The manager Tina then ran it 2 more additional times prior to bringing us the card to contact the company. After waiting there for over an hour with multiple employees staring at us as if we're going to walk out with literally only one exit. As we leave, we hear \"they're walking out\" with the manager replying \"they paid\". Why we have to be treated like criminals, because of fraud warning, is ridiculous. Not to mention our entire order was cold and more than average wait time, leaving us to simply take the meal to go. Never returning.",

So she sends it back and it comes back after we have finished eating and it's now over cooked. I understand it is difficult to cook a stake rare but they are charging $15 for this stake and after all it is a stake house. She didn't finish her dinner. Second my wife orders a stake as well. She doesn't like pink in her meet (yes she is weird) she orders medium well. Again it's under cooked it's bleeding this is a problem as she is turned off at the sight. She doesn't finish her dinner.   Third  my daughter orders chicken strips and fries. I can't tell you what they served her. She said it looked like tongue. She didn't finish her dinner. Fourth I ordered a full rack of ribs. The meat was so dry I had a hard time eating it. I forced down half and I couldn't eat any more.  So, I paid $100 for bad food and good service. I got to say the staff was great but the food was terrible.",

I give them five stars on every facet of running a restaurant.  The hostess is always friendly and efficient. They keep you informed as to the length of your expected wait time and get you seated quickly. The servers are always friendly, helpful and attentive; they do their best to make your dining experience a positive one. The menu is varied, with a great choice of meat, poultry, seafood and salads.  I believe their steaks and ribs are second to none. The steaks are always of good quality, deliciously seasoned and cooked to perfection, exactly as you order them.  The ambiance is very informal, or better said, rowdy cowboy.  You may even be treated to a spontaneous line-dance by the staff.  When you have a restaurant with great service, great food and a fun atmosphere, what's there not to like?",

The last two times I've been, the food has been great, hot, delicious,  and plenty to fill me up and still take some home, and I definitely love their reasonable priced large draft beers :-) My problem is with the servers, the last two were both moody, non attentive, and last night she straight up told me No when I asked for a water, and wasn't joking, I had to finally ask the other woman who brought our food as I had waited from ordering until then to see if she was kidding...  I  realize you're busy, especially on a weekend night, but don't take your bad day out on my family and I, she never smiled once, visited our table a total of maybe 5 times including to cash us out,  which we sat with empty plates for over 10 minutes waiting for our check before she came and asked \"do you need any boxes\" umm no thanks, we don't want any more drinks or anything either even though you didn't ask.   Anyway, to the management, I hope you work on your staff, because by the comments, it's not only me that sees the poor service and I'm willing to give you guys one more chance because I love the food and drinks, etc, but if you blow that, you've lost another customer.",

So we went & the parking lot was full, the wait area full & the restaurant full. The wait was just under 10 minutes. The service & food was both fast & yummy. I really enjoy the peanut deal still this day. It reminds me of the local Big Apples as a kiddo. Anyway we had 2 burgers, 1 kids burger & pulled pork. All were loved. I really appreciate the server letting my senior Mom order off of the kids menu. She couldn't make a dent in their regular portions & don't' have a senior menu. So this was really great.

As we were leaving I needed to use the restroom. as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean.  Than another worker comes in and they began to talk about another worker that just got hired and why the manager is thinking about promoting her and she just start working there. That's not that worst part. One of the workers leave out and and one stays in. The one that stays in is sweeping the floor. While I'm in the middle stall she sweeps my jeans and immediately apologize. IM PISSED!!!!! My question is why are you sweeping in stall #2 when you are in stall #1. That tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing.  So I come out to was my hands and notice that my pants were wet. I also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign. The young lady was in the 3rd stall sweeping so while washing my hands I said to her \"dis you just sweep my jeans with that dirty ass broom\" she says I said I'm sorry I say what is your name she says I said I was sorry I say I didn't ask for an apology I asked for you name. She doesn't say anything so I walk into the stalk that she is sweeping in and ask for her name again and she REPEATS herself and says I'm sorry.  Now I'm irritated and ask why she won't give me her name she meekly says ALYSSA. I walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager.   IT GETS WORST......  I asked for a manager and I got a manager I don't believe she gave me her name neither do I remember asking.  However I do remember that as she walked up  with ALYSSA telling \"her side of the story\" the manger was very defensive when I told her what happened in the restroom.  The manager wanted to know WHY was the employees name so important to me and if she was wearing a name tag why did I need the employee to tell me. I explained that ALYSSA was inside of a restroom stall and I could not see her until I walked into the stall. The manger than told me that ALYSSA was intimidated my me and she was on the verge of crying. I said well I'm sorry this is her job she works around PEOPLE everyday I don't care about her crying she swept my jeans with a dirty ass broom. The manager said well I talk to her. I looked at her dead in her eyes and said I JUST SPENT OVER $100 IN THIS PLACE TO BE TREATED THIS WAY. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN!   THE SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT THE MANAGER WHO WAS THERE ON OCTOBER 17, 2014 ABOUT 10 PM YOU SHOULD TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS WAY BETTER.",

I was out to dinner with my wife and felt like I was shouting at her and she was sitting right across from me. ROWDY is one word to explain it. I honestly walked out and breathed a sigh of relief, I could hear myself think. I honestly don't know if we'll be back due to how loud it was. We've been to other Roadhouse's and nothing has compared to this. It's not like I wanted a quiet, romantic dinner. I just wanted to have a normal conversation about my day but could barely be heard. Ruins much of the experience.",

He never came around to give us refills till we asked someone else. We wanted more rolls we asked him he said yes I'll bring some well he didn't he came back o take our order and said ohh I'll bring the rolls he didn't we asked someone else then that's when Kenny came with the rolls. I didn't like his service at all. Then when we hot our food my husband ordered bone in ribeye this steak is expensive OK and it had more fat then anything it was nasty we go to a restaurant for a steak not for a ball of fat. I was disappointed. I took a picture if they need to see it.",

The only complaint that I have is the side salad is very white and bland! A salad should have a variety of dark green lettuce not iceberg lettuce which has no taste. So thumbs down to their side salad! Overall they are known for their meats and that was delicious!",

After She brought us the Check the restaurant was still charging us For that Dirty and disgusting Drink . I again Ask Her For the Manager and She TOLD me that the MANAGER , ZACH L. was to busy to come and give us the attention that We demanded. I asked Her to Show Me where was the manager.   After several attempts she finally complied and when I approch the manager to demand a explanation about why was unable to come to our table to give him our Complain.  HE JUST TOLD ME WITH EXTREME ARROGANCE .YES it WAS A FLY I KNOW.   AT THAT MOMENT I TOLD HIM IN HIS FACE THAT I WILL CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT And For Him was No difference . He apologized only After He Saw Me raise my Voice which at The End was the only Defense that I was able to Use in order to vent my Frustration. From that Point On I raise my Voice even louder to Advise all the Customer about the poor Health Conditions of this Restaurant . PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN IN THAT PLACE , BETTER YET DON'T GO THERE .

Our waitress, Kimberly was her name, was very friendly and helpful and kept getting whatever we needed even when she accidently brought a sweetened tea to the table instead of an un-sweetened.   Our food was pretty good. I hadn't had the chicken \"critters\" in over two years, but they were just \"ok\" this time. Maybe because I hadn't had them in so long?

    "text": "I have been to this Texas Roadhouse before and the food has been acceptable.  In fact, on Veteran's Day we went in and I ordered the cheeseburger and asked that it be cooked \"rare\" and it was perfect and delicious.  I wanted to experience that great burger again so we went back tonight.  First, I requested no lettuce on the burger - it came with no lettuce, tomato or onion.  The waitress was absolutely wonderful - she took it right back and had the problem fixed.  The problem arose when I bit into the burger and it was cooked to the point that no taste was left.  I had eaten a portion of it when the waitress came back and I told her the problem.  She said she would get me another cooked properly but I was half done at that point.  I have a healthy appetite and almost never leave food on my plate.  Half of the overcooked burger was all I could stomach.  While the waitress was sweet and very apologetic I thought that a manager might have come to smooth over a disappointed customer, but that never happened.  Service is generally good but the food is inconsistent but fairly cheap, so just be aware that this the situation before you go there.",

Would've liked to try the beer but was driving. Had a 10 oz ribeye which was done perfectly. Sweet potato was great. Rolls were delicious. Other person's chicken sandwich (road kill? Not sure of the name) Was excellent. Moist and flavorful. Another's pulled pork sandwich was one of the best. The restaurant is great value. Will try to hit others if I see them. Could do without the country music but heck, if you go to a restaurant called Texas Roadhouse you'd better be expecting the slightly kitschy decor and country themes. We wanted to take our remaining roll with us on the road and asked for a box. They gave us a box and a whole set of new rolls! Highly recommend this. If I'm in the area, definitely will go back. Hope they bring one to LA with the same quality.",

The food is always made exactly how I ordered and it is always quick to come out. The bread and butter they give us is flippin amazing. Yes yes I know too much carbs, but every bite is worth it.  Last night we sat at the bar and Ian was our bartender. He was super friendly, attentive, and was  able to deliver great customer service. The mugs they use for beers on draft are the best because they are super chilly and keeps the beer at a perfect temperature :)  You must try this location! Just a heads up they do get very busy so if you can call ahead or if you don't have the kiddos go straight to the bar no waiting to get seated.   Honestly the wait doesn't even bother me because I know I will have a good experience.",

COLESLAW!!!  Sheesh!  Even Costco has a decent fancy pulled pork sandwich...WITH COLE SLAW!  I must've checked Yelp all day long, for total of at least an hour or more to find the best prospect. Sort of why Yelp is valuable, right?  Honey Bear was my 1st choice but closed too early. Next up?   Texas Roadhouse.   I got there, ordered a beer...find out, they no longer serve  cole slaw. Wait, what?  No longer slaw. Ok. No, not ok. A mess.  Hard to justify to you that my meal was now ruined. But it was.   That was a week ago. Last night, went back for a steak salad. Looked good on the Denny's-like picture-menu. Ah...  First up: rolls and butter. Ugh. If you like these rolls and butter, I'll bet you think those Starbucks frappucino-crap drinks are still coffee. They are not. This bread is so sweet...sweet like Hawaiian Kings which is waaaay too sweet for me.   Not since I last ate BBQ at a TGIFridays, RIP, have I eaten anything that sweet. Certainly not in a bar, that wasn't dessert. Cannot get that horrible sweet out of my mind.   The steak salad was a 6/10. Inferior, cheap cut of meat. flank not properly cooked?  Italian dressing waaaaaaaay too sweet. Outback same steak salad 8/10 -- at least. And not too sweet.   Listen, the place was packed. I'm probably the only one complaining. But if you want to get a cavity from just watching people eat, go to Texas Roadhouse. I'll be back in someone else's lifetime. Horrible food, sweetened beyond need or belief.",

Three table changes and 15min later we finally got seated. Our waitress had two tables totaling about 30 people and she was overworked and extremely busy. She should not have been given an extra table. I asked the waitress if I could use an expired Birthday coupon and she said she would have to check with her Manager but she was sure it was fine. She served the side ribs but didn't check until the end of the meal. Lawrence the service manager than came to our table with a rude attitude and said no its expired that's self explanatory. He didn't listen to what we had to say and disregarded our concern. I will NEVER be going back to this location until their management undergoes some customer service training and simple decency and communication training.   I have a background in the service industry and this could have easily been avoided had the Manager listened.",

I absolutely LOVE the food and the bread is to die for ! The new your steak strip is my favorite !  Now customer service  IS HORRIBLE when it comes to the hostess. I understand that we came at a busy time and there is call ahead waiting but the policy I think. Reds a little revision. So you can call ahead BUT all your party has to be here . I think this is a little unfair I understand why they do it I've known people that have worked in the restaurant business before and I get it but my party of 7 was only missing 1 person and they wouldn't seat me . I was going to order for the person and everything but no couldn't even get on the wait list . I've been to places where if at least 80% of the party is here they would seat you.   Back to the hostess - when I asked if I can at least be out on standby she said \"um nope al your party has to be here \" but in a very snarky stuck up way . They she proceeds to talk to the other hostesses and say \"ugh I hate working weekends I have to deal with these people \"   Sorry you hate your job you choose to work in The food / customer service industry  So now we get seated 45 mins later because the 1 person wasn't here and my server took about 20 mins to get us drinks and our food took about another 30mins  Don't know if it was an off day or maybe the staff or location but never have I had this type of \"I hate my job\" environment. Don't believe I'll be returning to this location . Disappointing to say the the least",

The employees don't seem to have any sense of urgency and tend to watch their bigger tables more so than the smaller number of people ones. Wish they would realize that just because there are more people doesn't mean that they will get a bigger tip from it.   The wait wasn't that long for being busy, we came right before 4. Actually still sitting at our table.  Server came over in a decent amount of time so that wait wasn't long. It took longer for her to come back with the drinks (and we didn't order from anything from the bar so can't blame bartender for being slow).  We ordered right away because we usually get pretty much the same thing whenever we go to any Roadhouse. I get having a longer ticket time when the restaurant is full so the wait for food wasn't all that bad. However, I ask for the extra things I'll need when I order so when the food arrives I can just eat instead of having to wait.  My food didn't come with the one thing I asked for so had to wait for her to come back and then wait for the one small thing I needed to come back. And now the rest of my food has gotten cold.  But that really didn't matter because my steak wasn't even cooked right anyhow. I guess they only know how to make medium steaks today because mine was not mid-rate and my nephew's was not mid-well. They were both medium. It isn't a huge difference....but when you are famished and really looking forward to your order, it sucks.   The manager was supposedly informed, but I guess they don't do table visits here either.  Seems like they go more for volume than repeat business",

Nice touch. I liked this location better because there wasn't too much shell debris on the floor.  We had a coupon for an appetizer, so we ordered the Blooming Cactus. We enjoyed two orders of Caesar Salad and a House Salad with a tasty homemade Ranch dressing. For our main meals, we had a huge rack of ribs that we shared and also a 16 oz rib eye steak that was cooked to perfect medium rare. So far so good. The loaded baked potato was also lovely. The mashed potatoes with gravy was okay. The chili my son had some robust flavors working to is favor. Our favorite item was the sauteed mushrooms. Yum! I could've enjoyed two servings. The sad dish was served to our guest of honor: smothered chicken. They did not serve it with the cheese or the sauce. We returned it, and it looked like it was microwaved. That made the dish utterly unappetizing, and she hardly touched it. I ended up taking it home to be re-purposed.   Mike honored our coupon and gave us $5 off our bill. We used a gift card and paid the balance off. It was a nice meal except for that one dish. We will be back.",

I love the trashed shells scattered throughout the restaurant floor, it gives it character and a unique \"country\" feeling. And if that mess on the floor bothers you, you've got a stick up you a** and need to take a deep breath and relax a little. Haha Anyway, the bbq chicken was pretty good and the price was great at $9.99 and that comes with two \"homemade sides.\" (They preached the word homemade about 6 times while we were there). My buddy got a half slab of the \"world famous\" ribs and he said they were pretty good but needed just a bit more bbq sauce. The drink prices were reasonable and the location is great, just north of interstate 10 and 75th ave. in the west part of the phx valley.  Service was above average and the music volume was at a good level. Nothing crazy awesome, or really special, but very good and at a good price!",

The prime rib was nasty and burned all around , it was very dry and we told our server which she was understanding and talked to her manager to make us a new one but it just seemed like they just cut the edges. No discount was given and the steak was still dry. I'm disappointed because for a steakhouse it was a disappointment.

The rolls are the only reason they don't get 1 Star.  If you're looking for just good steak this is definitely not the place to come. Your better off broiling a steak in the comfort of your home. Customer service was a little below average. If you want a good steak dinner I would recommend going to gen Korean bbq in Tempe. All you can eat for $15 (lunch price $23 dinner) so many different steak options it's so amazing. They have 4 different steak cuts on the menu my favorite was the Hawaiian. Forgot the whole name of it. Just remember it started with Hawaiian. Aside from the steak the best thing on the menu there is the KFC. It's like an upgraded version of orange chicken it's amazing.",

The food was exceptionally good tonight. I had the beef tips with onions and mushrooms in brown gravy. Portion was huge, meat was tender and the mashed potatoes home made. My husband had the filet and could not believe how good it was. We had a birthday dinner this week at one of the very expensive steakhouses and he said his filet was as just as good at 1/3 the price. Don't let me forget the fresh bread and cinnamon butter as well as the really good house salads. I know it's a chain restaurant, but they are consistently serving good food at a really good price. Hope this helps.",

Everything was yummy including the three baskets of rolls I fucked up. The food could have been hotter and my steak more rare but it was still good. It was seasoned to perfection. The rolls with the cinnamon butter are so yummy and addicting. The rolls taste a lot better when they are straight out of the oven. Service was ok and was weak compared to the other waiter that was attending the other tables around me. I will return in the future.",

So because there was no seats available we went outside and sat on the benches they have. In the past, the seating hostess would stand at the door and call us, so no big deal. As we were waiting, she came to the door and called for some customers with a party of 2.  Maybe 5 min later she came out and called the other people milling about that had a party of about 18.  We only had a party of 4, and it was now about 25 min wait, so we went in to ask how much longer, only to be told that \"they already called your name\"....problem was they didn't.  So we ended up going to Taco Bell, which was very disappointing, as we had a family member with us that was flying out the next morning. This was to be a nice send off.  We have noticed that this particular restaurant has really been getting busier, so now the service is really suffering for it. Going to try Longhorn Steakhouse.",

A party of 8 was called to be seated; yet we had been there waiting an hour.  5. I decided to leave and asked them to change the party size from 10 to 9, because I was leaving.  6. I started to question the staff employee, then unbeknownst to me the manager was standing near and yelled at me not to yell at her employee. I clearly was not yelling.  She then proceeded to kick me out.  Natalie got into an argument with my family and kicked them all out too. 7. I finished my cordial conversation with the employee. 8. Found out (supposedly) there was a party of 22 prior to us; in addition to another large party.  This was not communicated to us when we arrived.

We ordered Chili instead of salad, when it didn't come out we asked the waitress and she said she brings it out with the meal... Usually it's brought out when the salads are brought out, so she went and got them. Seconds late here came our dinner with more chili...she asked of we wanted it, we told her no, then she went to the table behind us and asked if they wanted it. She told them not to tell anyone she did that and then came back and took the chili from our table and gave it to them.  Needless to say our food was not up to par, not was our service or experience!",

Well upon getting our table our server was very friendly. And after looking through their menu they had very few selections of dinners to chose from. My family and ordered their sampler starter which was delicious it had snake bites, chicken wings and potato wedges covered in cheese and bacon. I then ordered myself a ribeye with a side of cole slaw, mash potatoes and I had to special order Mac and cheese which I found odd for a steak house.. Most steak house have Mac and cheese normally. Well I got my plate my steak and 2 sides were delicious but my Mac and cheese looked and tasted like Kraft Mac and cheese I wasn't to pleased with that.. Overall my food was pretty delicious the waiter was friendly and checked on us periodically and gave us pretty fast service. The environment was very loud and crowded. So For two plates and one child plate our bill came out to $70.00 not including a tip. Upon exiting Texas Roadhouse a homeless person was waiting at the sidewalk and approached me and my family and begged me for our food which was very sad but killed the what was romantic evening.. Not one of the best steak houses I've ever been to and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "My daughter's best friend recommended this place and said everything on the menu would be fantastic. My young adult son and teenage daughter and I went on a Saturday, around 1pm. We were promptly seated, at a wooden booth.  A bucket of peanuts was already on the table, along with a basket of rolls and linen wrapped silverware. The peanuts were fresh and the rolls and cinnamon butter delicious! I ordered a (frozen) margarita, son a Cherry lemonade and daughter water with lemon slice   . The waitress then offered to refill our bread basket.  We promptly agreed and thanked her for the consideration. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so it took a while for us to choose. We couldn't hear the music for all the screaming babies seated at neighboring tables. We finally decided to order the combo appetizer which included cheesy potato skins, buffalo wings, snake bites (breaded jalapeno cheese balls). For lunch, I suggested my kids pick from the lunch time special ($8.99). My son chose smothered steak (sides french fries and corn), daughter grilled pork chop with peppercorn sauce (sides mashed potatoes and corn) and I opted for (blue ribbon) half slab rib (sides french fries and a salad). We didn't have to wait long for our appetizer to be served and had barely finished before our main course(s) had arrived. The food was plentiful. I was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy. The ribs, while tender and falling off the bone, were also mushy and seemingly water logged. I thought maybe the cow had been drowned! Of my entree, only the salad was great! I nibbled from my kids plates. My son's smothered steak was da bomb! My daughter's pork chop was dry as dust, even after she drowned it in sauce! ! For dessert, my son ordered the big brownie, daughter strawberry cheesecake and I ordered the apple pie. My final bill, for all of the above, was $81 not including the tip. We were all stuffed and couldn't complete our meal so we asked for plastic boxes to take our food home. They were promptly given.   Later, when I reheated my ribs at home, I was just as disappointed as I'd been at the restaurant. Overall, the service was great, decor great, floors a little greasy, noisy with all the  babies screaming, and  the food (although plentiful) left much to be desired. I wish I'd gone to the Big Apple instead.",

The staff are all smiling and welcoming you, and just the atmosphere of the place was great! Roasted peanuts await you at your table, along with some delicious bread! I had a bacon cheese burger, which I could only finish half, while my husband had a steak that he actually enjoyed! Our waitress kept up with the drinks and checked up on us enough, but not to much to where she was bothering. All in all the service and food was great! I will definitely recommend it to others, and be back myself!",

    "text": "Rolls. That is my primary reason for going to a place like this more than once. Texas Roadhouse has the best dinner rolls when they are served hot. Throw in the cinnamon butter and it's a little oral fiesta. I am NOT someone who likes going to Outback Steakhouse-type chains. I only set foot in Texas Roadhouse because I won a gift certificate. But considering the prices, the quality is more than decent. Their ribs are truly fall-off-the-bone. I had their country fried chicken which wasn't very greasy--points for that. They also serve really tasty catfish fillets that aren't dry and are flavorful. I also like how one of their many sides offerings includes sweet potatoes. And they are big potatoes. You can easily come away with leftovers which means, two meals for the price of one.   If you are not in the mood to be in a place where the wait staff highlights birthdays very loudly, then skip Roadhouse. When it's someone's b-day, they actually have the person sit on a saddle and get everyone to sort of \"yeehaw\" along. It's like a bad commercial. Anyway, I can see myself going into one if I'm in the neighborhood and want to splurge on food that isn't the healthiest.",

I was involved in three birthday celebrations, I like to have fun when I'm out so I cheered people on.    As for my star rating, I would like to give four stars but the corporate feel always pulls my mouse towards the left  The last time I ate Texas Road House was in Phoenix.  I can say the restaurant delivers what it says it does. I haven't ordered the steak but I plan to come back one day, and give them a try, the ribs were satisfying.    So what is my review, well give this place a try for a corporate Texas feel.  The place has a dedication to serve high quality food and is ready to get you wasted in a family environment.",

Nobody in town can match that value and quality. Incredibly consistent every time. Love having the peanuts available, plenty of TVs here if I want to watch the D-Backs, Cardinals, or the Coyotes. Let's not talk about the Suns though recently. Also have had the Rib-Eye here which is also great, flavorful, and consistent. I guess they hand cut the steaks here and the gritle and fat are always trimmed off.   Good salads with good dressings, huge potatoes done nicely, flavorful rice if you are in the mood for that (and I frequently am).   Can get very noisy there, but I guess it's part of the western cowboy atmosphere. The employees line dance, and yell at the top of their lungs for customers birthdays. Servers here are ALWAYS pleasant, efficient, and into their jobs. Tips and management must be great. Very high recommendation for TR. It isn't a prime steakhouse if that's what you're looking for, but the steaks are very close to prime quality and the prices much better...",

But I'll keep going. If you're a steak lover you gotta order yours smothered. Not only are the steaks juicy and flavorful but the are cooked to perfection. I've eaten in fancy steak houses in Vegas and they got nothing on Texas Road House. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Chicken tender and juicy, hamburgers are big and delicious, shrimp are succulent. All of the side dishes are to die for, BBQ beans, corn, sweet bread with cinnamon butter, mash potatoes, Caesar Salad, and loaded baked potato are all amazing. The full Bar has the best margaritas. I can't say enough good things. I've been eating here for over 10 years and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Where it's a romantic date or a family dinner you will have a great finger licking time. Enjoy!",

It was fast as soon as we got in. When they sit you down, the hostess has a basket of bread and sweet butter which was good. There are a bucket of peanuts at every table. Portions are good size. I had the mushroom burger and my girlfriend had the rib eye. Both good. It's lively place with lots of tv's. They also have steak you can buy and bring home to cook.

Your dinner starts with warm rolls that taste like they are made with a slightly sweetened dough. Cinnamon sugar butter is served alongside them. We ordered the baked salmon dish with a side of steamed vegetables. The salmon was cooked perfect with a slight crisp on the outside. We also ordered the T-bone steak and rib combo. You are given the option to add mushrooms and/or onions atop your steak.  I opted for both. I had a salad and sweet potato as my sides. The steak was juicy and ribs were tender.  The house salad was a fail. It will only anger you. The lettuce wasn't crisp and the rest of the salad was eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and croutons. Bland and boring. So aside from the sad salad the rest of the food was good. During dinner the wait staff performed a dance routine which was entertaining to watch.",

The ribs are delicious fall off the bone tender but what restaurants call a full rack isn't a full rack so if you want a rack like you buy at the store you wont get that here.  The T bone and Rib Eye's are amazing, could use less salt for me but excellent steaks.  The service is warm, friendly and attentive NO COMPLAINTS, well worth $60 (including tip) for a T Bone, prime rib and fixings plus a beer and a frozen drink. Ended up with enough food for 2 to have lunch the next day.  Dressing is made fresh, if you don't like cheese on yoru salad order without or get the Cesar its fantastic, ask for extra dressing and put in your doggie bag for the next day! its that good!",

My wife's ribeye was too salty, but they quickly brought out another when we told the waitress. We had ordered a combo meal, with a 12 oz ribeye and some ribs, and this was more than enough for the two of us. In fact, all of us ended up bringing home leftovers for the next day's lunch.  Our waitress was very attentive. She also participated in a staff led line dance next to our table. They made my son-in-law's birthday special with their birthday saddle and free ice-cream.

The warm bread provided was excellent, and the only reason why I didn't eat everything was because I wanted to leave room for the beef.  Ordered the bone in ribeye, prices were really affordable. I wouldn't say the quality is on par with the best steakhouses, but for the price, the typical result is usually crap. Not here, it was well charred, nicely done with enough salt and pepper to bring out the flavor. I had a great time with the ribeye, definitely worth it (and great for my pocket) when I feel like steak for dinner.  The shrimp add-on was a surprise. Lots of garlic made the shrimp really delectable. After I went through half the steak, I decided the shrimp tasted better =)   Great meal, and I'll be back!",

We are regulars at a different location and never have to deal with this crap. I assume poor management at the west side store is the reason for such poor service.  At last he food arrived and the order was taken WRONG!!!!!!! I would expect nothing less!!!",

It could get much better if you remember to get there before 6Pm for the earlier bird specials.  I had the steak and rib dinner. The portions were large and cooked to perfection.  The ribs were tender fall of the bone delicious! I will be back and bring my rib eating friends.   The steak is so melt in your mouth tender it really is like butter!  Better than any Ruth's Chris or Morton's out there and at a great price!! The service is as good as the food. Lots of attention from the staff.  This place is amazing - its #1 for me in the steakhouse category and will be my go to spot when i want to have an amazing dining experience and great food!",

    "text": "Mistakenly ordered the chicken fried sirloin. I did this about a year ago and I actually had forgotten how wrong this dish is. This is a special Texas dish that should be so tender one can slice into it with a fork. It should be made with ground sirloin or double tenderized steak. The sirloin at Roadhouse was a thinly pounded out piece of leather with several veins of hard  grizzle running through it.. The fried outer layer was overcooked, over salted and smooth. It fell short of the layered, fried chicken crust this dish should have. They did get the creamed gravy right. The brown gravy is also  good, but salty.  Husband's sirloin was ordered medium well. What he got was charred on the outside, dark pink on the inside, throughout. He had to send it back, and we have never sent a dish back int he 15 years we've been together.  I did not complain about my meal because I realized this is just the way the dish is prepared there. But....I will never order it again. I don't even think we'll bother going back there.  If you do go, the rolls are still yummy and amazing. The beer is still cold and good. Don't bother ordering steak unless you are ordering filet, however, because their steak seems too leathery. It was pretty awful.  We were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible. It is NOT the delicious, tender, forkful of yum from your Texas childhood. It is the stuff of nightmares.",

Then they display your number but tell you to stay aside for another 10min while the waitress stand around talking. This time the hostess tried to seat us but call the wrong number so she asked us to go back and wait.   We finally got seated at a table with no peanuts.  The new waitress was nice & did a good job.  The menu has nothing healthy on it. So, I didn't order much.  My order was a house salad & water.  Simple order though my ice berg lettuce was yellow & bitter. My one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok.  My man ordered Road kill- GROSS! Our was so salty. It was a thick burger smothered with salty onions, mushrooms & cheese.  Baked parasite was the only thing good on the plate.  My son ordered a burger with fries. It was just ok...nothing special & can get a better burger @ Red Robin.  The bun was the best part of the meal he said.   Before leaving the waiters & hostess were dancing but NONE OF THEM looked happy having to do it. All in all...we will not be coming back.",

The fast friendly service and large portion sizes surprised us. My prime rib was not cooked the way I ordered it and they couldn't have been nicer about redoing it. We took home tons of leftovers - enough for an entire 2nd meal the next night. The prices were lower than you might expect for large portions of very good food.",
