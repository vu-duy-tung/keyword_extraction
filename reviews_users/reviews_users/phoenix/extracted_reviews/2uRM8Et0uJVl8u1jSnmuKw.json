    "text": "A little disappointing in light of all the rave reviews we read before going there. The eggplant curry was very salty and the spice level definitely tasted more like a level two instead of the level one that the menu indicated.  The pad tai was a little too sweet for us. The pad seew (flat wide noodle) was very greasy and had some noodle pieces that were charred and tasted burnt. The food took a long time to come even though there was no one else there when we sat down. I understand that the ingredients are fresh and from scratch so maybe that's why it took longer.  As other reviews have mentioned, the price was high for the small portions, especially the hefty upcharge for the forbidden rice. The owner/chef was very friendly when we sat down, but the wait staff was not attentive, probably because there were only two people (one of whom was the bartender) working the whole room which filled up quickly. We are glad we tried something new but probably will not come back.",

A little difficult to find as it is set back quite a ways from the SE corner of Shea & Scottsdale.  I entered for lunch and two white guys were working the tables.  Nice interior, food was tasty and fast, but seriously small portions.  Then again the lunch special only costs $7.95 which gets you a main and a soup.  I had the spicey noodles (Phad kee mow) with chicken at 3 stars (out of 4 possible).  It was tasty and I enjoyed it, seemed slightly reserved on heat but they probably didn't want to offend anyone and I still enjoyed it very much.  Where the rip is on the drinks as they charged $2.95 for a soft drink.  Add 20% for tip and it pushed it to over $14.   That's just not good value and it hit me wrong.",

The restaurant is located at the intersection of scottsdale & shea .... when you drove by, it is very easy to spot as this is probably the only restaurant / shop open in the plaza.  Inside out, the ambience of the restaurant is great if you can overlook the shopping center is kind of run-down.  It doesn't look like your typical thai restaurant. It has low light and very chic deco, quite a cute place I must say in term of ambience.   In term of food, the quality is a OK ... nothing to wow about. Ordered basil beef and the uncle som's seafood ... both are good traditional thai food. It's good but nothing out of the ordinary, both the cut of meat and seafood are not great ... I can get the same quality of dishes at another Thai restaurant right around the corner for 50% off their price. This is not a place for the value of food, rather, the price you pay is more for the ambience.  And I must agree with my fellow yelpers that the service is SLOW ... yes, I do undersand that everything is made to order ... but honestly, so do any other thai restaurant. Thai food is not something you can pre-cook anyway.   And in term of slow, it's not only in the kitchen, also the front end service. Our server was slow , not in term of time to place order and checking ...  but he was slow to understand ... or he was plain ignoring what was requested.  I asked for the pepper tray THREE times .... still no pepper tray when I paid the bill. And he got the bill wrong and I kindly pointed that out to him, and he brought back the exact same bill :-\\ ... not the kind of service I would expect in this type of restaurant.   Overall, good place to spend the evening to have long conversation and have decent food with good atmosphere if you are willing to pay for the ambience",

Those that don't know better may be OK with the food here.   The Thai Beef Salad was very disappointing.  Very salty, overly seasoned, and not tasty.  The beef itself was hard and chewy. This can be such a wonderful dish when prepared correctly.   The Tom Yum chicken soup I ordered 2/4 stars on the spice level, was incredibly spicy- focusing on hot spice rather than balanced flavor.    We walked out with a $35 bill and still very hungry, as we barely ate 1/4 of our feed before just giving up and leaving.  Truly an expensive and greatly disappointing dining experience.",

I enjoyed it so much the first time that I came in the next night and ordered another bowl.  It is the first thing I order, sometimes even before I decide on my drink. I love that it is locally and independently owned.  I also think Pete (our usual server/bartender) does an awesome job.    The Pad Thai is not my most favorite-maybe because I like mine with tons of sauce,green onions, lime, and cilantro and Takeda Thai's is more restrained.  I think the Green Curry is fresh, light, and perfectly seasoned.  I also love the Pad See Yew.  I wish they would offer Moroccan Tea ALL the time- if Moulay had this available daily, I would be there daily.  It was a life changing tea experience.  I have to settle for the Thai Iced Tea, which is good, but not nearly as delicious.  Overall, I love supporting my neighborhood and avoiding the chain restaurants and am always satisfied here.",

I had just passed one Thai restaurant on Shea Blvd and thought of turning around to go back, but then I spotted Takeda Thai through the parking lot.  It was amongst some businesses which were not restaurants so at quick glance, I thought it might be a massage parlour or spa.   Anyway, my stomach must have subconsciously known the deal, because I continued straight in that direction and upon entering rejoiced - it was in fact a  restaurant.  Two seconds later I was kindly greeted by a gentleman who led me to the bar to order take-out.  He let me know that everything is made-to-order and any dish I wanted could be prepared vegetarian.  Super cool!   He also let me know the spice scale.  All the curries sounded delicious and I finally opted for the eggplant curry.  Good choice.  My weakness for spring rolls got the better of me at the sight of the word \"crispy\" on the menu and I asked for those veggie as well.  Excellent choice.  They. Were.  C R I S P Y.  And fried in an oil that wasn't heavy.  So were they gobbled up before I got home?  Naturally.  The eggplant was very delicious too.  It's mild flavor had a hint of spiciness which was perfect.  Mild should not mean \"flat.\"  Garlic and basil were prevalent as well.  If I could change anything, I would ask for a larger serving.",

It wasn't crowded so I was nervous and didn't know what to expect.  However, the blew me away with the service, food and ambiance. We chose the patio, quiet and unassuming.  It happened to be a beautiful evening so it was romantic for us.  We started with the lettuce wraps.  All I can say is \"outstanding\"!  I honestly felt like I was in another country!  The flavor was unlike anything I've had.  We also ordered a curry dish and we both ate it all up!  It was absolutely tasty!  We are not potato and carrots people so we left those behind but other than that it was also outstanding.  This restaurant is a diamond in the rough.  Don't hesitate if you're on the fence. I'm glad we did....we'll be back.  Thanks!!!",

I spend 15 bucks on lunch and leave hungry.    Very nice dining room and atmosphere.   Opens for lunch for 3 hours or so then closes till dinner.  Closed at weird times some days as well.  Knocked off a star for that too.    It is definitely worth trying and you be the judge on the price to portions.",

We had two of their specialty curries with tofu: mango curry and pumpkin curry. They were so fresh and delicious, the best curries we've ever had.

    "text": "This place is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley. Let me give you a run down on my visit. As I am walking in I immediately spot the herb garden in the front. We get seated and our waitress takes our drink order. Comes back, drops our drinks off after about 5 minutes. Leaves and comes back a few minutes later to take our appetizer order. We order a Spicy Edamame. Super, super tasty and it is certainly spicy. Thank goodness we were properly taken care of with a glass pitcher of water for us to refill when we needed. After we finished our appetizer our waitress takes our dinner order. I order the spicy noodles, with vegetables instead of chicken (level 3 spicy). Do you see the trend here? Each visit by our waitress was individually catered to a specific need. She didn't take our order while dropping off the appetizer; instead we enjoyed each order. This visit was certainly about the experience--and I loved it because we were celebrating a birthday.   The food was homemade--everything, even the noodles. The spices were grown in her garden and the dessert was absolutely fab; homemade coconut ice cream and friend bananas for the table to share. The guest I was with was celebrating a birthday so the owner brought him a drink which was a combination of a mojito and a margarita (Basil-rita), and yes, it, too, was made with fresh basil from her garden. It was delightful.  So this place gets 5 very bright stars. The owners came up to our table, talked to us and gave us a mini version of the story behind the place and the waitress was full of life and energy.    The place wasn't noisy and it was the atmosphere was not what I expected from the outside. I will return very soon!",

We had attentive but not overbearing service and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the owner(s) Ms. Sarah Takeda and also really enjoyed our chat with Moulay himself!   But of course we were there for food! Sarahs recommendations were on point!  We really enjoyed the Coconut soup (cant remember the official name) and my husband was delighted that he got to have sweet and sour chicken!  A rare treat when you are gluten free, the chicken isn't breaded and the sauce isnt overly sweet=PERFECT!  We also enjoyed a dish of homemade coconut ice cream and oh.....I almost forgot the Thai tea with RUM!!  YUM!!!",

Unlike other places it doesn't matter if it's dine in or take out, the food is consistent and flavorful. Make sure you branch out and try different things or eat family style sharing dishes. One thing to note is the dishes aren't huge but about average size to feed one person.  It is a little more on the expensive size in relation to the amount of food you get. If you are looking for a nicer Thai restaurant to eat at with consistent quality and taste I doubt you will find one.",

The coconut milk creamy thai soup, with shrimp and mushrooms was phenomenal. It had an excellent amount of thai basil, lemongrass and was deliciously savored.    The chai tea and the jasmine tea were a hit with my son.   My sisters like the spicier tastes, and Chef Moulay brought out different spices for them to try. Luckily for them, they had drinks to cool their palates off with.  My mom eats just enough for a bird to get by on, but she LOVED the charred veggies and rice. She needs to try the forbidden rice next time.  We enjoyed the Sunday evening, it was a great time with family, and we think we found a nice place to return to when we are all in town again.",

If you get the Thai  craving, don't expect anything special from Takeda Thai. Our bill was $45.57 for TWO People. That's a little high for tiny portions and subpar flavor. They charge $3.99 for Thai tea! Without telling you if there are refills and their famous coconut ice cream? Is a joke. We got two baby scoops that were the equivalent of a tablespoon for $7.95. After we were done, our waiter took close to 40 mins to close is out because he was busy talking at the bar. This place needs a lot of work and better management. They also need to lower the prices. The $45.57 would be worth it if it was amazing food and service, but they fell very short. Save your money and keep looking for another Thai venue",

My menu arrives promptly but with sticky residue all over it.   There was one food runner and one server/bartender and while it is not a big place, he stood and talked to what I can only assume were \"regulars\" for so long that other guests were neglected. I wanted a Thai beer but thought I would try one of their cocktails and order the beer with my meal. I was finished with my meal before he saw me staring him down and then I sat drinking my beer while not enjoying food with it. I also wasn't offered chopsticks or even a knife so I was awkwardly pushing the food around on the plate with just a fork.   The red curry that I got was very delicious - I read online that they don't make the food spicy so I ordered it \"Thai hot\" and even with the ultimate spicy option, it was so so spicy.   After my meal, I sat for over 15 minutes waiting for a box/check/acknowledgement.",

I came in a little late to meet my family and the waitress wouldn't even look at me to offer me some water. She was only interested in their orders I suppose?? After I mentioned I'd like a drink she walked back to get water and slammed it down on the table half full and warm. My family and I looked around and it appeared she was the only server working on a Friday night???? Way understaffed and dirty dishes and drinks lined the entire bar!! Not one clean table. We were shocked! The owner came over as we looked a little annoyed and mentioned \"I'm the owner, we are busy, would you like to move?\" We prob all looked confused and simply replied \"no?\" Which was extremely strange? After that the additional chef/owner/manager came out from the kitchen and strait up demanded what the problem was. After trying to mention they needed more staff and it was a little dirty he cut us off yelling \"do not interrupt me!\" I was in utter shock. He then proceeded to say we should be grateful he cooked 200 meals himself and he was doing the best he could??? Umm... what?? Get some more help! Be prepared for a weekend shift? He was about 2 inches from our face explaining we were in the wrong. I have never in my life been in such an uncomfortable situation. I would never go back here due to the verbal abuse and out of line staff. Great food... HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!! Ahhhhh!!!",

    "text": "Choose your spice 0-4.  3=hot, 4=Thai hot.  I think any Thai place you go you might as well put a Thai qualifier in front of all spice levels bc it's always hotter than asked for.  My 0 spice curry was thus Thai 0 spice, as it definitely still had a kick.  Not too bad, but enough to be bothersome when you have inflammation and are real sensitive to spice and emphasize NO SPICE. Anyway, enough of that rant, it looks like there are some quality items on this menu but it's very expensive.  My yellow curry was $14 for a medium sized portion and was just okay.  At other places in the area I have gotten the same quality curry in twice the portion size for cheaper.  If you really want to spend, they have some delicious-sounding specialty dishes that run around $25+ (e.g. grilled curried salmon or roasted duck dishes).  Anyway, that's not me at my age and budget.   Overall, my impression was a Thai restaurant with a nice atmosphere that wants to present a fine dining experience but the food is just slightly above average.  Of course I've only had one dish, so make your own judgment on the food.  I would say that this place would be great for a date night if you are willing to spend some money.  Very nice atmosphere.",

The two times I have been there there appears to be only one server for the whole restaurant (at least at lunch).  He did great, but I did wait a smidge though;  that's my issue since I and others probably are conditioned for blazing fast service.

Eventually a gentleman, who I assume is the owner, sitting with some patrons came up and sat us. Besides him there was only one waiter so the service was quite slow. We got the lettuce wraps with larb ga to start. The larb was tasty but the lettuce was small chunks of romaine that was mostly just the core. For mains we got the red curry and panang curry which tasted really similar. I thought they were both mediocre. The consistency was on the runny side. The portions are fairly large so that was an upside.",

Our food was great!  I loved the flavors here, and the dishes were all complex and True to their authentic roots.  I agree with the other reviews though, that this place needs more servers.  We were going out on a Saturday so our party was patient and more than happy to wait.  Had this been an intimate dinner date, I'd hope the pace would be quicker.  Most of that can be attributed to the fact that the place is short staffed.  Hopefully, people will visit this place and change that. :)",

    "text": "After reading the reviews and ratings for this place, it sounded worth trying.  I had missed the review below about all the added costs and small portions.  I explained to the smarmy waiter that it was my first time here and asked for a suggestion and the Eggplant and Zucchini dish was great.  From there it went downhill.  He upsold the Forbidden Rice for 2.75 and made it sound like it was a choice that came with the entree.  I could have let that slide, but when I asked for the Fried Bananas for dessert, he came back at me with something about did I want the fried banana with coconut ice cream.  I said \"yes\" thinking that must be the ice cream they were serving with it.  The irresistible photo someone added here had 4 fried bananas drizzled with honey or something similar with a scoop of ice cream in the middle.  I got 2 very dry, fried bananas with such a tiny scoop of ice cream that they had to serve it with a very tiny dessert spoon.  When I looked at the bill, I had been charged 2.95 for the substitute of that tiny bite of coconut ice cream.  So I paid almost 11 dollars for this small, boring dessert!  (The outstanding Bananas Foster at Eddie V's is huge compared to this and might actually command the higher price, but the cost is much less.) The waiter seemed to think that their ice cream was something spectacular.  I don't eat a lot of ice cream but I've had coconut ice cream that was equal to or better than this.  All I can say is that by treating customers this way to make a few extra dollars on the bill, in my opinion, will do nothing but turn people away, especially locals.  I would have gone back because the atmosphere was nice and my main dish was pretty good, but I prefer to give my business to places that are genuine and honest.  There are other Thai restaurants I will try next time.  Sorry, Takeda Thai, you didn't earn my business.",

    "text": "To start, the food was 5 stars.  It was just several other things that would keep me from going back.  Where do I start?   First, the only wine choices, (3) they have are all $11.00 a glass.  $11.00?!   Even very expensive restaurants have choices in the $8.00 range.  Some even less.  It's a very simple concept that Costco started....sell them for less and just sell more.  I'm sure the high dollar Scottsdale lease is very expensive but I would have had two 7.00 glasses....which makes 14.00.  That's 4.00 more then 11.00.  Very few people are going to have 2 glasses at that price....which for a couple is 44.00 worth of wine by the glass.    Next....we were a party of 6,  that's not a \"large\" party.  When they brought out our checks and we sent them back with our payment....when they return with the CC slips, they had added the gratuity.  Instead of adding it when they first brought the check out as everyone else does.  It felt like a bait and switch.  And 6 people, come on?   They added 20 percent to the full total even on the tax.   I would have tipped 15-18% naturally.   Next..... Our friends had a superfluous charge for brown rice....they hadn't ordered a side of brown rice.   They only ordered a side of white rice.  The brown rice side that was about 1/2 of a cup of rice was 2.75.   That was on top of an already 14.00 dish.  Really?  A dimes worth of rice for 2.75?  Just bring another side of rice if your patron isn't satisfied with the 1/2 cup that came with the 14.00 meal.  Just because.   And when my friend dared to ask the charge to be removed.....we all got the feeling she...we....were being thought petty.  I don't care if it's only one nickel over.....it's not YOUR nickel, it's the patrons.  They actually debated with her about it and I think it took two tries to get it off the bill.  She would have dropped it and paid it....no way. Next...I ordered a side of 7.00 crispy green beans.  When he went to write it down he repeated something completely different then what I said.  I caught it and asked.  He had instead ordered me a 14.00 meal that has  green beans.  The two sounded nothing alike.  I'm not sure how he confused that.  In any case, I conceded.  And later I was irritated I had. Next...I don't want to be told I'm having dessert.  I want to be asked. \"Save room for the coconut ice cream\".   How about \"did anyone save room for dessert\".  When we replied that we were maybe going to have dessert at the Maverick coffee house next door we were told \"that place is closed\".   And it wasn't.  To be fair, normally it is closed at that time but it was open for a special event.  But it was still an abrupt weird reply. We were a party of 6 and another table of 2 who were also connected with the special event at the Maverick were in the restaurant that night.     Other than that there was another 6 or so people in there in the time frame that we were there. So...had the special event not have been going on....half the people there wouldn't have been there. The main problem I think is the price.  Thai food should be reasonable.  Usually is.  Even high end like Wild Thaiger on Central has dishes mostly in the 9-12 dollar range.  And 8.00 glasses of wine.  And is way hipper design wise then this place is. Although it's nice in there.    So my advice.......they need to adjust the prices, get better wine options price wise and keep making that wonderful food and they'll  be packed out on a Friday night at 8:00.    They won't need to upsell or charge for a extra side of rice or haggle over 2.75.  People want the Trifecta.....fabulous food, prices and service.   That's called Durants.  It's very upscale but worth every penny.......they have a 6.00 glass of wine if I'm not mistaken.   And I spent 91.00 tax and tip for 2 people to eat rice and sauce.....I could have gone to Durants.  Durants lets you spilt a 28 oz. slab of meat and it comes with a extra set of sides for only 5.00 more....and they tell you that when you say your going to \"split\".  That's why 60 years later they are still around and packed out.  You can't walk in on a Friday or Saturday usually. We shall see how Takeda fares.  And I disagree with Yelp...it's 3 $$$, not 2.  Especially since its Thai. Another positive....the person who I think was the owner but wasn't waiting on us was very nice and welcoming.",

It got to the point where I could tell the 4 tables in there noticing how strange it was that the servers were acting like I was invisible. After the 12 minutes of feeling like chopped liver, a girl came up to me and said \"we aren't sitting any more tables tonight\". Oh thanks for telling me 12 minutes later while I just awkwardly stood there watching all of you walk past me. And no sorry? What the? I was a server for yearssss and I could not even imagine ignoring someone for that long at the door.

We waited 30 minutes for someone to even come over after we were sat and ask if we wanted drinks and another 20-30 minutes for them to get our food order. Then half our table didn't even have drinks/water and I had to actively grab our waiter's attention to get anything done. I watched another table get sat, wait 20 minutes without being served, and walk out after being forgotten about. Our server got the order wrong and getting any refills or additional drinks was up to us to go up to the bar or grab another server. I feel bad because I could tell that the guy with the beard was working hard, but he is frankly not cut out for the service industry. I would've tipped less if the gratuity wasn't already automatically included in our tab. I've honestly never seen anything as bad as this. I just want to clarify that it takes exceptionally bad service for me to go out of my way to write such a negative review.",

    "text": "Go for the food!! Seriously this is hands down the best Thai food in all of Scottsdale/Phoenix!! And, YES, I have eaten at nearly every Thai place in the valley...  I have had exceptional service even when the place is packed and extra busy. In fact, I recently went with a friend visiting AZ with a 2-year old child.  The owner went out of his way to make sure the child was happy and occupied with food to keep her happy.  As for the spice issue I just read the review-- not everyone can handle spice and I am often asking for additional chills and peppers to enhance my food, I just know to ask for it THAI HOT now. For those who do not tolerate any spice, I have seen the kitchen send out very mild and wonderfully flavored food for my friends who have sensitive taste buds.  Raves and accolades each time!  Let's just get into the food-- The quality of the ingredients used are always fresh.  I have ordered many dishes on the menu and have made substations that have all be delivered with a smile. The soups are divine, the papaya salad is almost as good as when I was on the beach on Thailand-- BTW, I spent three months in Thailand and have a minor obsession with Thai food...  At first glance the seafood dishes look pricey, but once you try any of the dishes you will taste the quality that you are paying for!  The standards-- Green Curry, Pad Thai, and others are spot on delish! Uncle Som's Pad Ped makes my mouth water for days after... The spicy edamame rocks!! The home made coconut ice cream-- YUMM!  The bar is well stocked, although the wine list is pretty Meh... All the great Thai beers and a few others too.  Here is where you will find a kind, honest, hard working owner who makes the very best and most authentic Thai food in the valley.  If you want the best Thai you must try this place. You will be greatly impressed with the quality of food, preparation, and the taste of each dish you order.   If you really enjoy Thai food and want a high quality food experience this is your spot!  Since you will be back many times after you try, I look forward to meeting you at this amazing Thai place.",

For curry, I think the Mango Curry is my favorite. Mix of spicy curry and sweetness of mango mixed together to create yummy dish. I ordered extra rice and finished the curry sauce.  It was just spicy enough, my Thai tea helped me sooth spiciness in my mouth.  I tried two different types of fried rice.  They both were good, but I think I liked Korobe fried rice. It doesn't look like standard fried rice you see in any Chinese restaurant, but it taste like authentic fried rice I ate somewhere in Asia.  There are so many other dishes I haven't tried yet. Can't wait to come back to try them all soon.",

    "text": "Sadly, I only just went for the first time last week, despite living a short walk a way for the past three years. I suppose this is due to general dissatisfaction with the state of Asian restaurants of all kinds in Phoenix/Scottsdale. They seem to be very hit or miss, and it seems like people out here don't know any better. Suffice to say, my experience today made me regret my not giving at Takeda Thai a chance earlier.   First, the food was great. Thai food is usually good but not great. I ordered the soup after I heard a passerby raving about it. It was rave-worthy. I also ordered drunken noodles (pad ki mao). The waiter (who turned out to be the owner, Moulan), did not bat an eye, and the food came quickly. The noodles were also amazing. I ordered them with beef, which turned out to be tender, appropriately-seasoned top sirloin. They don't have cheap beef there apparently. They charge $3.50 extra for this but it is a no-brainier--get it anyway. Moulan also brought some sort of thin egg roll (?) thing which was also fantastic. Imo it was fresh made; I would be shocked if it came frozen off a truck like many restaurants serve around here.   Second, the service was absolutely fantastic. Moulan is great. He has wonderful manners, and is very charming and friendly. After I learned he was from Morocco I asked if he could make Moroccan mint tea. I regretted this immediately because I've heard it is a PITA to make, and started to reconsider, but he would not have it. Do I even need to say the tea was amazing--the genuine article.   Third, despite being in a *slightly* aging retail area (SE corner of Scottsdale and Shea), the ambiance was great. I sat outside on their enclosed patio with beautiful brick flooring. It is not apparent to me that any expense was spared in making the place look great. Needless to say, everything was also spotlessly clean.  Usually people say something bad here to balance out the review, and I would if I had anything bad to say, but I don't. This place is definitely going to the top of my rotation, and I would recommend it to anyone. I had the best dining experience I've had in recent memory there today, and it was only lunch time!",

They were small but with six per the order, they were tasty. We ordered the green curry, yellow curry, Tom khai Gha soup, and the Pad See Ew noodles for dinner. All were good. I am not a huge spice person but I tasted no heat at level 2 and thought level 3 was too hot. But, it may just be me. We had fun and will most likely go back if we get a craving for Thai.",

When we came here on a Saturday night, I was surprised to see that other patrons had clearly put on their best sparkley outfits just to dine here.  This is in a strip mall, people.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the many upscale Asian restaurants in Minneapolis where you can eat, drink, dance, mingle and lounge in your best outfit all night long.  On to the food... First of all, why doesn't Takeda Thai have fresh spring rolls?  This was my first disappointment.  I settled for the lettuce wraps for my appetizer instead - which they happily veganized for me - making it with with tofu rather than chicken.  The flavors and textures were really blah though.  I wouldn't recommend that appetizer to anyone. I shared my main entree with my boyfriend, not realizing how teeny-tiny the serving would be.  We had the Thai Basil with tofu.  The flavors were amazing.  Although,sadly, the entire dish was made up of about 6 pieces of tofu and 6 thin slices of red pepper.  I would've been a lot more impressed with this dish if there were more vegetables involved.  When the dish was set in front of us, I actually felt misled by the menu's description.   I also think the up-charge for brown rice here is a little ridiculous...but at least they offer it. Our server was spectacular.  He knew we were in from out of town and did his best to impress us.  At the end of our meal, he asked us how we enjoyed ourselves, and I didn't have the heart to tell him that Yelp's phrase was ringing in my head...\"meh, I've experienced better\".",

Two is nice and spicy three is pretty hot. We've been to some great Thai places in NJ & NY and this place is just as good.  If you like Thai, don't miss this place",

The dumpling on the inside lacks a little bit of flavor, but to me, that's okay, because the dipping sauce that comes with it is so good and well balanced with acidity and spicy chilies. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Red Curry with chicken. I like it pretty spicy, but if you don't they can make it any way you want it. They also give you extra chili sauce on the side that you can add. The jasmine rice here is perfectly cooked and fragrant. If you drink here your bill can add up pretty quick. It isn't inexpensive, but for the quality it is worth it. The restaurant is in a strip mall and you would never know it's there otherwise. When you walk in through the curtains, it is a quaint space with asian decor. The staff is stellar and very helpful with the menu if you have questions about anything.",

As a person of Thai decent, I have been to Thailand numerous times and the authentic food that is served at this restaurant really gives me that 'homey' feeling. Also, I can't say enough about how beautiful this restaurant is!! Although it is tucked away in an older/less-flashy part of Scottsdale, this cozy restaurant is decorated with classic Thai art which provides a wonderfully romantic and classy ambiance. Such a great date-place! :) Anyway, as far as food is concerned.. I haven't found a dish that I don't LOVE- the curry is on point (all flavors), firecracker chicken is to die for, pad-thai is a classic, and the thai basil and spicy noodles are delish!! Any of those paired with a Thai iced tea or Thai beer is a sure bet!! ALSO- If you're looking for an EXTRA SPECIAL TREAT- try the HOMEMADE coconut ice cream or banana spring rolls! DELISH DELISH!",

Their pad thai, soups, chicken  and fish entrees are incredible.  The food is very fresh, served with a smile and presented perfectly.  The banana dessert is wonderful, too.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the service is great and the food is delicious.  What more could a patron want when they are dining out?  I like the fact that whether you are dining alone or eating with other people you receive a genuine warm greeting when you walk in the door, receive top notch customer service and wonderful food.   Moulay and Sarah have done a fantastic job with this restaurant.  They are truly passionate about Takeda Thai and it's evident in how they treat their customers and the quality of their food and services.    I have and will continue to recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for the best Thai restaurant in the Valley and will definitely be back for more.",

I love Thai food and always get especially excited when I find a place that serves pumpkin curry with tofu as an option. Plus they had a variety of other specialty curries as well that I found intriguing. My boyfriend wanted to get the cucumber with lime salad to start and we both loved it! It was fresh and crunchy, very refreshing. I hadn't had a salad like that before from a Thai place. The man who served it to us told us he was the one who made it too which was cool! For this meal he ordered red curry noodles with chicken. He enjoyed it! I got the pumpkin tofu red curry and it was amazing, creamy, and flavorful but I was sad about the portion size, like I left the restaurant still craving more curry. Not to mention it was quite pricey for portions that did not fill us up really. However our food tasted good and everything seemed fresh. I'd recommend for a splurge every once in a while! But maybe don't come if you're starving and wanting a lot of food like I did haha.",

We fell in love this place and will defiantly be going back soon. The atmosphere was charming. The service was great and the food was amazing. We ordered the Wok Charred Edamame, Chicken Pad Thai, and Yellow Curry. I would order it all again. The owner/chef is great! Best thai i have had!",

It was a late lunch maybe 4 tables were occupied the place felt a tad small inside so we opted to have the patio all to ourselves. Waiter was nice and helpful. I ordered the Pad Thai w shrimp and my mom did the red curry. The shrimp were a nice plump size they were cooked perfectly, I wish there would have been more shrimp on the plate but ce est lavie. The veggies were nice and fresh I thought it was very flavorful compared to other places I've tried Thai food. Not too many places have even left an impression on me the food is usually pretty bland. I tried my moms red curry and it was delicous. The Thai Tea was awesome I wish I had one right now. It was good I will return!",

    "text": "I want to give this place 4 stars, but overall the food just wasn't 4 star caliber.  Started off with the crab fritter things and the tempura shrimp.  Neither were that good...the crab fritters were more or less just a really garlic-y creamy filled deep fried pocket and the the batter of the tempura shrimp was pretty oily and thick.  For the main courses I tried the pad thai, chicken panang, and the pepper garlic tofu.  The pad thai was typical but it was served with skinny noodles similar to spaghetti...personally I prefer the wider, almost a smaller fettuccine type noodle with pad thai.  The pepper garlic was pretty tasty and the veggies on that dish were the best part.  The most memorable part was the chicken panang.  Served with rice...it was rich and coconutty and really tasty.  Actually it could have been a little spicier, but it was definitely the best thing I had that night.  The service was great and the restaurant had a great atmosphere.  The more I think about it, the main courses were a little bit above average taste wise, but I think the problem for me was that it was the most expensive Thai place I have been to.  You weren't really getting that much more for the higher price point.  However, I most likely will be back.",

The pad thai isn't my favorite though. Ordered with a \"5\" heat factor it was more sweet than hot but my companion didn't seem to mind (although he did agree that my dish was better).  We overheard another patron complain about her food being too hot. This prompted the owner to come around to each table and inquire if anyone else felt their fare was overly spiced. We happily disagreed and said if anything we thought it wasn't hot enough! I liked that the owner checked it out before going back to the complainer and letting her know (politely) that she was the only one in the place that was unhappy. THe only complaint I had was the wait. Someone must have called in sick because there was only one server for the whole place! The bartender was helping out but it all took way too long. I like the place, so I will be back and hope more staff is on when i go.",

First off, let me say that the service was very good.  Our waiter always kept our drink glasses full and was very attentive. Now on to the food... We decided to start off with Lettuce Wraps.  They were very good...although a little spicier than I would have expected for a \"2\" out of \"5\" spice level. I ordered the grilled shrimp with the thai peanut sauce.  It took a while for the food to come out and when it did the food was lukewarm.  The shrimp tasted like it had been pre-cooked and then tossed on the grill to heat it up a bit.  It was very dry.  The veggies were steamed but cool and the Thai peanut sauce was also on the cool side.  The brown rice was pretty dry and a little tough to choke down.  Definitely not worth the $17.95 for the dish. My friend got the Thai Basil with chicken - I tried a couple of bites and wasn't that impressed.   I was very suprised at the small portion sizes - I would have exprected more for the price we paid. Unfortunately, I can't give this place another chance since I don't live in Scottsdale but even if I did live there I can't say that I would go back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Don't be fooled by a pretty face. Every review I've read about Takeda Thai raves about the fancy facade and upscale interior of this small strip mall restaurant. I think belief is suspended at the door, as most reviewers go on to praise the food. Phoenix Magazine even rated it one of the 23 best new restaurants in its October issue. That actually is my reason for writing this entry - to give a dissenting view.  For lunch today, we ordered pad thai ($7.95 from the lunch menu, $13.95 at dinner), garlic mini pork ribs ($10.95) and angel wings ($11.95) from the appetizer section. Our very nice waitress brought us two bowls of soup instead of the one we were entitled to. It was a mild chicken soup with a few vegetables and some tofu floating in it. OK, certainly not notable. Then the rest of the dishes came out. I was truly shocked by the plate of riblets. There were 6 tiny riblets on a bed of wilted lettuce. Remember, these cost $10.95!!! They had been fried to death and had no garlic taste. I looked closely at the lettuce and noticed a few bits of overly browned garlic sprinkled on it. These clearly had never touched the ribs. This was downright insulting. The portion size of the angel wings was somewhat better. Angel wings are large chicken wings which have been boned and stuffed with vegetables, minced chicken and glass noodles, then fried and sliced. Like the riblets, these had been overcooked and were totally dried out. The insipid \"sweet and sour chili dip\" tasted only of sugar, and dunking the slices of wing in it did not revive them. Somehow the \"chef\" even managed to turn out dry pad thai with a horrible fishy back taste. When our waitress came over and asked which was our favorite thing, the only answer I could give was \"the service\". Our cost, even with a 10% discount coupon, came to $40.  I guess I could give the restaurant and its reviewers the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps since it was lunch time a talented chef was not on duty. However, if that's the case, and no one better than the person who was in the kitchen could be found, then lunch should not be served  The only review I read that got it even partly right was from AZ Central. It said \"the kitchen assumes you don't want to play with fire, so everything here is mild enough to feed a newborn.\"  I hope you won't think I'm a grouch, but I did want to warn you.",

We tried Takeda Thai tonight and were overjoyed to discover it is even better than our (former) favorite place. We ordered the mango curry and the Pad Thai. Both were delicious. The Chef even brought out an appetizer he made for us on the house (also delicious). This place is a gem!",

Curry was amazing. As I was eating it got busy so that was a good sign. Only thing I wasn't completely satisfied with was spicy level. I like very spicy so I asked for hottest which is \"thai hot\". Was decent but not what most \"thai hot\" places serve. But as I looked at the receipt I saw spicy level 3 and I could hear other people ordering and being offered up to spicy level 5 so maybe there was some confusion there. Either way very good meal.

We were greeted warmly at the door, seated immediately and given water and menus promptly. Each of the staff came through and introduced themselves, our server Rebecca tells us this is a family operation and apparently so because her mother and step-father (guessing here but probably got enough info to make this accurate) eventually come through, introduce themselves, offer to help with menu selections and we all feel welcome and well attended.  Food was very solid...rib appetizers, awesome. Green papaya salad was entirely tasty, but not spicy. Pad Thai and Thai Basil were not my choices but I certainly wasn't complaining either. Food was well prepared, pacing was perfect, rice was perfect.  If I had one complaint, it's simply the prices which just seem to be more than I would have to spend elsewhere in a good Thai restaurant (though I'm not going to name any names for comparison). Price setting is a marketing decision that they have made and perhaps given their location, decor, quality of food, many will think their pricing is reasonable but I don't.  Food, staff, experience all say 5 stars, pricing says no and that's my opinion.",

I think the dinner menu is a tad bit high compared to what I'm used to paying back in San Diego for the same quality. While the price is higher than what I'm used to, I think they are spot on for the area, so keep that in mind when reading my criticism on the matter. The lunch menu has some great specials on it though, so I would highly suggest checking that out if on a budget.   Anyone on the search for a good Pad Thai should give this place a shot. I've tried several places since getting into Scottsdale and this is the best as of yet. I'll be making this place a regular destination.",

When I asked for 8 out of 10 heat, I got exactly what I expected.    Moulay was in the restaraunt along with his wife and they talked freely with me about their concept in opening the restaraunt and what came through loud and clear was their commitment to making dishes fresh when they are ordered.

And when I go to a Thai restaurant I expected something with more than a passing resemblance to Thai food. I ordered \"Thai hot\" for my meal and what I got...let's just say I've had bowling alley nachos with more kick. Ordered steamed white rice..got some zero-gluten (read: non-sticky) brown rice. And they forgot to include my soup in my \"to go\" order. Finally, I ordered a Thai coffee and got what can only be described as plain black coffee with lots of heavy cream. A disaster. This all would have been made okay if what I *DID* get was actually tasty or well prepared. It wasn't. Undercooked beans, overcooked tough beef, a broth that seemed to be made from black pepper and water.   I honestly cannot think of a worse Thai restaurant.",

Moulay is a very gracious Executive Chef, Proprietor and I was blown away by his down to earth interaction and great warmth.  A Moroccan who does Thai like a Thai native makes me happy.  Great mid day meal and I'll be back ... I am pretty sure my dinner picks will move me up to five stars.  Oh... and for rice... go ahead with forbidden rice... nice nutty flavor and a great complement ... Ok ... never mind .... FIVE STARS it is now that I thought a little more on it...   Highly recommended though I can't tell if Moulay hypnotized me or not :-)",

    "text": "Avoid Takeda Thai by Moulay at all costs! My boyfriend and I came here last night and had a terrible experience. I rarely complain about food or service but tonight there was chicken bone in our lettuce wraps and I bit on a piece and it hurt my tooth really badly. THEN when I got my Mango Curry, the chicken was still raw on the inside! Completely unacceptable. Besides the food, the service was terrible, we waited over half an hour just for one appetizer, and another 20 minutes for the second one. Our curries took over an hour to get to us. Not to mention the manager was completely rude. At one point she reached over for my fork and took it off the plate that I was still using and placed it on the table, but didn't pick up the plate. It's like, why did you just touch my fork in the first place?! For the prices you pay, the food is subpar and portions are extremely small. $10.95 for five crab rangoons that are extremely small? Not to mention a $15.95 curry that comes in a small bowl with an even smaller bowl of rice? I can justify paying those prices for portions that keep up with cost. Come on. The manager didn't even want to apologize for the service we received and for the bone in the lettuce wrap or for the raw chicken in my curry. We offered to pay for what we did drink and eat but she said we didn't have to pay. Instead of apologizing, all she did was ask if we had been there before and after I said no, she looked at me and said \"No, I'm pretty sure I've seen you before.\" I kept telling her no, that I haven't been here. They treat new customers like trash and praise returning customers from what it seems like. Avoid this place like the plague. There are much better Thai places out there.",

The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, although, it is a smaller space the intimate setting is quite enjoyable.  The food was delicious, it was flavorful and full of bold spices!  The best part of our experience at Takeda Thai was our interactions with Moulay and Sarah. They were both very charming, sweet and genuinely interested in getting to know their customers and making them feel very welcomed. I would suggest Takeda to anyone looking for a low-key dining spot with great food and terrific service!",

    "text": "I've been here several times, and have yet to have an experience that I would classify as unpleasant.  First, I would have to say that all the comments about the service being slow are 100% accurate. I don't know what it is about the atmosphere here, but everything just goes really slowly. My water glass has never been left empty, but there have been several moments where I wondered where our server was.  I've never noticed the longer food prep times that others have mentioned, but I usually expect a slightly longer wait for Thai food in general.  The staff is always friendly and sociable.  Pricing is definitely an issue here, but its due to the small portions. I've actually not gone here on more than one occasion due to the price point/lack of value on your dollar spent.  Menu items I've tried:  Beef Salad (excellent, my favorite dish here) Edamame (get their special version, not the plain version) Beef Jerky (a little salty for my taste, more of a seared beef than jerky) Red Curry (just what you would expect, nothing great but not bad) Green Curry (just what you would expect, nothing great but not bad) Panang Curry (just what you would expect, nothing great but not bad) Tom Yum Soup (very good, get it with shrimp) Tom Kha Gai Soup (their best soup, very good with chicken or tofu) Drunken Noodles (excellent, good texture, good spice, great flavor) Pad Thai (love their version, not too sweet, good choice of noodles) Papaya Salad (not very good, I\"m more inclined to the Isaan version that's spicier, this version is too sweet for me) Mahi Mahi with Black Mussels (very good, I was pleasantly surprised by this dish, it was an excellent recommendation by the server)  I would go back more often, but the portion sizes are small and the location is far away from me.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants good Thai food with a great intimate atmosphere. Bring a little patience with you and you'll be in for an excellent evening.",

    "text": "If  perchance you're one of the many Scottsdale residents who believe Malee's is the only place for good Thai, think again. You have another choice, it's Takeda.  Takeda's dishes, the result of generational family recipes prepared by the owner rival anything on Malee's menu and, I don't have to drive half a city away for it.  Last night I tried Uncle Som's something or other. It was splendid. I went with two and a half on the heat scale. I don't recommend this level of spice unless you're a seasoned pepper aficionado, one who routinely eats raw habaneros. My wife typically orders the same dish each visit, the green curry. Spicy and wonderfully delightful. But the coup de gras is their 'forbidden' rice.  We were informed how this rice got it's name from the King of Thailand who apparently forbade anyone to eat it except for him.  What an asshole, right?  Well it's a damned good thing someone smuggled the shit out of Thailand and got it into Scottsdale, where now, I can eat it at will.   Purple in color, short in grain, and when cooked to al-dente perfection, has a unique flavor all unto itself, never having tasted anything like it before.  The best way to describe it is this:  If I was King (Scottsdale), I'd command Ken Singh of Singh Farms to grow this stuff for me, and only me. Nobody would ever get to try it.  Well, maybe my wife if she was nice to me for a change and not alla-time smarting-off.  I'd let Ken Singh keep some for his trouble, but not very much.  And that's it... no-one else. Well, maybe Takeda.  Yeah, probably Takeda, since they already know how to cook it and all.  But that's it. No-one else. The rest of you would be shit out of luck.   Why I'd even post up security guards to make sure the kitchen help doesn't try weaseling off with their pockets loaded.  And all of you?  Forget it. Nobody gets to try my forbidden rice. Nobody. Why, I wouldn't even let you SEE it.  Not without paying a cover charge or something.   But sadly, I'm not the King of Scottsdale.  Shit.  Go to Takeda. Eat the forbidden rice and know, you're eating something that only a few hundred years ago in Thailand would have probably gotten your head chopped-off or something.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to try Takeda Thai  after her reading glowing reviews of this ethnic establishment.  So on a weekday lunch we decided to give it a try.  At around noon only one other table was occupied.  We both decided to order the green curry with chicken as that's one of our favorite Thai dishes.  When the dishes were brought out, we were dumbfounded at the small proportions on the plate/bowl..(see accompanying picture- using a spoon for sauce depth reference. The vegetables in the picture look sufficient enough, but that's because I spread the mound of them out in the bowl.)  We decided not to bring this issue up but when the check arrived my friend mentioned to the waiter how SMALL the portion was for the price - $7.99 and explained that at Thai House - located very near to this establishment - portions were much more generous - take-out being in a quart container for $9.99.  The waiter (who was actually the owner, as he told us) said:  \"It's a lunch\" -although that was not denoted on the menu - which was kind of confusing in itself.  Then he said:  \"You want MORE???   I'm the owner, I can give you all you want.\"  We agreed to that.  When the entree came out, there was only one entree instead of the expected two - and two plates were put down  - his expectation that we would SHARE the one entree!!  The portion was just as small.  When my friend examined the check, he CHARGED for the additional serving!   In addition, we both had Thai tea that ratcheted up  the bill another $8.  I've usually paid around $2.50 at other Thai restaurants for Thai tea.  Needless to say, we won't be going back there - ever!  $42. (including tip - don't ask me WHY she left a tip) was way too pricey for an afternoon lunch.  I might add that 3 small bowls of soup were ordered for a child that was with us - those at only  65 cents each.  One dessert touted as \"homemade\" - coconut ice cream was $5.95.  You can see a picture of that if you type Takeda Thai into Yelp's search bar.  Looks like the serving is one scoop :(    Post Script....I thought I could add a pic to this review but turns out I can't",

    "text": "Service is terrable. We went on a Friday night, there was 1 server, 1 bartender, 1 busboy for the whole restaurant.... But, at the end we realized our server was actually the head chef and the owner! Totally changed our view.  Do not order a mojito, it's not impressive, I sent mine back. The table next to me was not impressed either.   Food on the other hand is delishious. We dinned on the following: Fire roasted Edamame Chicken Satay Yellow chicken curry Pumpkin chicken curry  Coconut ice cream   Everything was amazing, truly impressive. I highly recommend a visit to this little gem of a place. I would give it 4 Sayra based on the service but, knowing how hard everyone was working I felt bad and have to give them a 5.",

We did not wait for long and left immediately .",

    "text": "I totaly agree with some of the comments on here, the food was good, but not specatacular. The expereince was grade \"f\" Very disapointing.  The menu was limited because , the witer said\"there would be 100's of people lined out the door in a few minutes, \" it was 7:30 pm then.  He acted unexperienced and kept touching us as though he were a relative.  When asked to explain the dishes all he could ay as that it would be lovely.  They nevver did get busy and we were only given a fork no other cutlery.  After the food was finished we ordered the famous cocunut ice cream which is all they ofered, sat there and waited, then our waiter came and asked how we enjoyed it, we told him we never got it, and at that point just wanted to leave. He was seen as others offered on here, visiting with the staff and regulars there. There was a wait girl who had on jeans and sports shoes under a chef coat, very down beat addition the expereince that they so badly try to give.  it wass so dark with no candles, very hard to read the menu. The owner wh we spoe to and offereed our feelings about the eperience said he is very wealthy and this is his hobby, he offered a refund and we refused, so he gave us the ice cream to go.   Let me jsut say it was not the money, but for the prices the service and the ambiance should have been top notch.  I feel the proces do not match the atmophere or the service, and i might add the owner wanted to do nothing but argue about that as well.",

I had a group of 10 come in and I called Takeda to see if they could accommodate us and Mulay (who I found out later was the owner) was so great and said in a funny way \"you bring the people I'll get you the table\"!  All of my friends loved the food.  We had spicey edamame and some people had the red curry.  I had the Spicey Noodles at a 2.5 level which was the perfect hotness.  The owner was so kind and generous and I could tell he was a really good guy.  The food was amazing and we will all be back! Go check it out!",

It is kind of hidden in the middle/towards the back of a strip mall area at Scottsdale and Shea -- find it; IT IS WORTH IT.  The restaurant is small, intimate, dark, and would be a great date spot (however, I was allllll byyy myyyseeeeeellllff).  It is a super cute place that I am planning on returning to with my mom in the next week or two.  The prices are comparable for North Scottsdale.",

As stated, I ordered the Pad Thai with a spice level of 4 (their highest on the menu).   My food arrived and the presentation was average, but I'm here for food. I take a bite and I am immediately disappointed. The Pad Thai was sickening sweet! and the \"4\" spice level I asked for was non-existent. I am not the type to waste food but I left about 80% of my food on my plate and had no desire to take the leftovers home. How bad was my food, well, let's just say I left the restaurant hungry and ate as soon as I returned home.  I would not go there again for their overpriced sweet meal. This would be a 1 star if not for the good wait service.",

The pad Thai we recieved was in incredibly small portions and not even made with pad Thai noodles.  I will not be attending this restaurant ever again.",

We went back a third time in late April and had papaya salad and egg rolls, both of which were good.  We then ordered one of their specialties: roast duck.   When it arrived, we noted that it was a small duck cut into quarters, as opposed to slices of duck that you normally find. We each took one bite and immediately spit it out.  The duck was very old and spoiled.  (It seemed older than me and I am on Social Security.)  We asked for the bill and wanted to leave.  The owner/chef came out and asked us what was wrong.  We told him.  He offered to cook another, as it our duck had a younger relative in the fridge.  The owner reminded us that he has studied to be a chef in his home country of Morocco, not Thailand.  We asked for the bill and wanted to leave.  He brought the bill without charging us for the duck, but asked us not to write up a description of this restaurant.  We did not agree.  It might be that they do not serve duck often and it was just very old and badly prepared.  In any event, it should never have been served.  We will never go back.",
