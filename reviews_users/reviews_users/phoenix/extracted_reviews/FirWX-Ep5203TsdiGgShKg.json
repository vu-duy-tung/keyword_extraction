    "text": "So, for some reason I thought that this Vig would have a bit more to offer than the other Vig, considering The Vig Uptown is listed as a 'restaurant' and the Vig is listed as a 'lounge'. The only difference is that the Vig Uptown is much bigger, with a lot more tables. The menu is exactly the same.  The food is good (not like insanely good, but good) This time I ordered the Greek Salad, which was very flavorful and filling. Service is mediocre....a little faster and more attentive than The Vig. The wine I ordered (pinot noir) tasted like it was a day or two old.... :/  It has a cool ambiance, but not my first choice considering the plethora of cool places to check out in phoenix, which much better service and food.",

My bf and I went there with a couple of friends and were really surprised we hadn't been there before.  The atmosphere is pretty cool and the bar area is big for when two people or yourself want to go and enjoy a drink.  They have a pretty cool enclosed patio area with seating and a fireplace for those cool desert nights.  The food is great as well.  We all tried something different and were amazed at the flavors and the portions are enough to take some home.  We had an amazing waiter who gave us recommendations and made sure we always had a full glass of wine.  This is someplace that I will come to again for sure!  I think that it is way better than St. Francis or places like that in the area!",

Hey, Monday still makes it a $6 burger and fries, so I'm all good!  We get there a little after 5 now and take advantage of some half price appetizers!  Then at 6 we put our burger order in.  We are cheap but the food is NOT!  Value, quality and great service.  Sometimes you wait when they're packed but who cares?  Best darn value on Monday in town!  Nicole is my favorite waitress!!!  Ask nice and they'll sell you some dip for the sweet potato fries!! ( I cannot duplicate it at home but still want it when I fry them myself!)",

No seriously, 5$. I love this stuff, and to see it out priced so reasonably was fantastic. Made me a fan for life.   Oh yeah, getting a chance to whoop some friends at bocce wasn't bad either.

The renewal of the old Arizona Bank branch has yielded a wonderful open, naturally bright-but-not-too-bright  human space. The area with the bocce court feels like an ideal patio straight out of Sunset magazine or something.  They have one of the better happy hour menus around. A favorite of mine is the Indian flatbread (with the tastes of tandoori chicken and chutney). Good deals on drinks as well.  The Saturday-Sunday brunch is served from 10 to 2 each day, and there's a whole lot of creativity going on with the items offered. I've never had a bad dish here.  Complaints? Well, no self-parking during busy times--all valet. At least these guys know how to drive a stick. That's not always the case.",

We had a group of five, and only received two meals and a side of fries that no one ordered.  After about ten minutes, we finally asked when we could expect the rest of our food.  He half way apologized and said he forgot to put it in.  So we reorder the remaining three meals, and only received two more.  Again, we asked when we can expect the fifth meal, and were again told that he forgot to put it in.  We ended up telling him never mind on the final meal and asked for the check, to find out that we were being charged for items we didn't receive, and items we received but didn't order.  They fixed the check with no problems but obviously it was too late to redeem themselves after that.  At no point did we get a sincere apology, get to speak to a manager, or receive any of our items comped, except the ones that no one got to eat.    The food was good, so one star is an accurate review for our dining experience.  By far the worst and strangest experience we have ever had, how can they forget our meals not once, but twice!",

The Uptown Vig as I've stated, serves up a mean hangover brunch menu.  They literally have a dish called the Hangover Helper.  Does it work?  I'll let you be the judge, but I tell you what as a runner it's great way to carbo load!  I recently had the Monte Cristo, which I'm not too sure why it's called that, but wowza!  French Toast sandwich with ham and over easy egg! Whaa!?  Sha-yeah!  If I had a hangover I've forget about it already.  Top it off with some fresh strawberry preserves and whip cream and you're golden boy (Outsider reference!).  Enjoy!",

Not fun considering you don't get the fair share of \"bottomless.\" We were hungry so I ordered the Monte Cristo and she ordered a burger. It took literally an hour for it to come out. We kept asking where our food was and our waitress had to keep asking. And when it finally did, I had a hair on my plate! Disgusting.   I'm only giving two stars because our waitress was nice and felt bad about the hour long wait on our food that she didn't charge us for it.   I'll stick to Hulas for brunch and mimosas from now on.",

Brunch is super relaxed, get coffee or a vigazz bloody mary, it's not too loud, people are playing outside, get some Guinness braised corned beef hash.. with potato pancakes, poached egg, and chipotle hollandaise (hell yes), or the hangover helper, chilaquiles rojas for the win.  Bottomless mimoas for $15, I miss living walking distance from here, lol.    Late nights, it's packed, and loud, and there is a dj spinning.  I remember tacos, lot of different kinds of tacos, and they were all tasty.  Grilled fish tacos, deconstructed fish tacos with swordfish, short rib tacos with kimchi!, fresh guacamole and chips, 16th st nachos, and Thai sweet chili wings.  It's local southwestern food, upscale, many many steps up from bar food, and it's a lot of mimosas.",

If you don't meet someone you already  know or find at least one person here you'd like to give the \"what's up\" nod (and that counts for you marrieds too), then I don't know what's going on...  The building used to be a bank. I like to think of it as recycled. But there's nothing secondhand about the visual. The decor is trendy chic, and the seating is all pretty comfortable - go ahead and be a Goldilocks, there are couches, booths, chairs, barstools, all for the trying.  Smokers hang out in the front yard, leaving the back patio and bocce area for diners and cocktail drinkers making for a very pleasant alfresco experience. You can try the specialty vodka distilled in Alameda, CA or go for your tried and True. It's all good here.   Like other places in town, the food is American Bistro with good deals, spendier items, and always solid, savory flavors. I've had good service even when it's hoppin'.   Complimentary valet parking makes this a pain-free experience.",

Last night I brought a friend to The Vig to experience life in his new neighborhood, and can truly say I doubt we will ever be back. We waited 20 mins at our table without ever being contacted, or even given water. I had to get up and ask someone if they have servers on the patio.   I was told they are \"slammed\" (not sure about this as there were many open tables inside and out) and will be with us soon and they apologize for the delay.   We were then rudely asked by a server what we would want, only for her to never return with our drinks. Another 20 minutes goes by (still an empty table..not a sip of water) when we decide to take our hungry and thirsty selves across the street to the Garage where were seated and fed within minutes of our arrival.  There were four people in our party, and between the food and drinks we would have easily dropped a couple hundred dollars here.   With so many other choices within walking distance, you guys really need to step it up. You used to be the first choice in the neighborhood, but due to your decline in service, you are losing many customers.",

    "text": "So I totally love the Vig on 40th St and I was glad to hear they opened a new location.  I have been wanting to check it out since it opened but just never had the time.  So what better time to go then on a Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine :).    I really love the new location's look.  It was a little hard to find if you have never been but after a drive by I found it on the second pass.  The building is very modern and really open inside.  Instead of the outdoor patio like the 40th st. location they have a huge Arizona room in the back.  It still has a fireplace but instead of a fire it's lit with candles.  This will be really nice for the summer months when the other patio is way too hot.    So on to the food and wine.  I ordered the starter crab and artichoke dip which was heavenly.  For beverage I got a bottle of Lapostolle Casa Sauvignon Blanc.  It was very good and with the half off price it was only $10.50.    On to the entree I ordered the Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa.  The salmon was good but being from Seattle I could tell it was Atlantic.  It's not necessarily a bad thing but I'm kind of a salmon snob :).  Anyways the Chorizo Arepa was very good.  It's a little sweet corn cake with Chorizo in the middle.  EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH CHORIZO!!!!   Overall a great atmosphere, great food, and a great restaurant.   I can't wait to go back for Sunday Brunch they have some great stuff on their menu for it and they open at 10am till 2pm.  MMMMMMMM",

Parking was a breeze and apparently there is another lot I could have self parked close by. When I mentioned this was a first visit for me the awesome hostess gave me a tour! (Seriously. How nice was that?)   I have to give credit where credit is due. And perhaps our experience isn't representative of what to expect on a regular night, but, if you can try and sit in William's section. He's new from New York (I'm from there) and his acting background was evident. Well, I shouldn't say that. What I meant is that his comedic timing was rocking. I was seated in the back of my booth but the jokes between my friends up front with him were side splitting. That kid (and I can say that as I'm *older*!) has got some spunk in him. (While being polite, efficient and presenting a wide knowledge of product knowledge.)   Good stuff, can't wait to go back!",

A good yoga friend is actually the designer on the project.  For these reasons and that I really wanted a Vig Azz Burger today(with the fried egg), I had to be there for the FTR.    This place is a goldmine, literally, it was a site of a former neighborhood bank.  I mentioned that on the review that was offered after the meal and my willingness to invest ( i wish...)!  Ask for Raven, she will take great care of you.  Imagine the Vig Arcadia, with more of an indoor/outdoor feel and the prerequisite bocce court.  The vibe is similar, yet more open.  From the moment you chance upon the exterior, your not quite sure what is to come.  The anticipation builds, so no interior photos for you on this review!  You have to visit and see for yourself!  I like that and much more.  There is even a firepit!     Go once, go back, go often, but first, just GO to the Vig Uptown, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I had a pleasant experience with a few friends in the outdoorish area of The Vig, but if it weren't for the good company and the hip, open-air atmosphere, I probably wouldn't have been as pleased.   The Pad Thai was mediocre (Imagineer that... Pad Thai at an American restaurant was sub-par? Shocking.) But actually, I feel like it was our fault for not figuring that out prior to ordering it. The deconstructed fish tacos were satisfactory, but somewhat bland. Also, I'm not so sure how keen I am on assembling my own food. I probably would have stayed home if I was in the mood for a good assembly session. My food-cracker friend loved her kid's mac 'n' cheese, although any person with an eight-year old's taste buds would. The highlight of all of our meals was probably the side of sweet potato fries that came with a burger. I may have stuffed a few in my fish tacos. Next time, I'll probably just order a platter of fries and call it a meal.",

But it's the staff that makes this location so great. Everyone is super friendly and attentive to your needs. If you're lucky enough to go when Madison is working the bar, you're in for a treat. She is hilarious and just has a great attitude and always makes sure your drinks are full and the food is just how you order it. I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "What's not to like about a second Vig, this one MUCH closer to my house? Actually, just a couple things. But let me start with the good.   I love the feel of the place as you walk in the door. Cozy and yummy colors. It's nice that they used an existing building. Would of been cool if they had used the first proposed name- The Vault. I just love the whole place...until you walk to the back. I understand why they are calling it a PATIO or OUTDOOR SEATING, but I'm not feeling it. It's cold, dark, gray, and not the same loveliness as the original Vig patio. Both times I have been here, it's been with friends and they were already sitting in this back area. That is what I am calling it from now on, by the way, the back area. My smoker friends appreciate the fact they can go out the back door to slowly kill themselves, but they've also almost been hit by the Valet guys pulling cars around.   I need to go in the sunniest part of the day and enjoy those big windows when they are doing their thing best.   The food is, of course, the same quality as the other Vig and you can always count on getting a yummy, if not slightly overpriced dish.   Kudos to James, the server. He handled our large group well and was prompt and friendly.   Overall, I am very excited to have this Vig in my hood, within bike riding range no less. I'm sure they are still getting some kinks worked out and they could use to add a few more light bulbs in the 'back area'. I know I'll be back to enjoy the Vig for fun times are always had at the Vig.",

    "text": "Oh @TheVigAZ, you usually do so well, but when you fail me, it's always an epic fail. Last night, you fell flat on your face.  I ordered the Vigazz Burger, anticipating greatness.  My girlfriend and her daughter received their food, and finished their meals. I got nothing.  While my girlfriend was still eating, I inquired with one of the back servers about my burger, and was told it was almost ready.  15 or 20 minutes after my party finished eating, I was still waiting.  The other people around me, who'd ordered around the same time as I (some before, most after) were finished with their meals, and still I waited.  I had by this time decided I no longer wanted my meal, but no server was present to inform.  While I waited for the server to come by to deliver the inevitable check, I noticed people who'd arrived AFTER we ordered, getting their meals.  And still, I waited.  Finally, after over 30 minutes, and nearly having to yell to get her attention (she was delivering more food to people who came long after we ordered, right next to us), our server came over.  When we informed her that I did not receive my meal, and that my girlfriend's order was incorrect (onions and tomatoes present, despite a request to not have them), and instructed her to remove my meal, she just asked if I wanted it to-go.  When your service comes up so short as to completely miss a meal, you don't merely offer to make it to-go.  In fairness, when she brought the check, she stated she'd spoken to the manager, and he'd also removed my girlfriend's burger from the bill.  It was a nice gesture, but last night it was too little, too late. I went home hungry, with a major headache.  I love The Vig, but sometimes it's a major disappointment...",

The reputation did not disappoint. The building is beautiful, the parking lot is full of expensive cars and the place is full of beautiful people eating, drinking and playing bocce ball. No ironic hipsters here drinking PBR, this is a place where you want to be in shape, dress up and head out for a fun night. They even have a \"Vig Rig\" to give rides to from the bar to people who've had too much to drink. I was just there to socialize so I didn't get a chance to try the food, but friends said it was good.   Its exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix.",

We walked into the outdoor patio area- there was a sign that said to seat yourself. I walked by a waitress and asked her if it was ok to sit at a two-top and get a high chair for my son. She said sure. About 15 mins later, we still didn't have a high chair or menus. The same girl walked by and said sorry, she would be right out with water. I said that I'd really like some menus and a high chair for my son.   She said sorry Your server will be right out--I was kinda surprised because this whole time I thought she was my server. So a couple mins later, my real sever came out to introduce herself. I told her that she's lucky my son is so good because if he wasn't I would have been losing it. I ordered him food right away- Mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, all very good. I ordered calamari for me, which was also very good. My waitress was very nice. She apologized for the delay and mentioned that they didn't have a hostess.   The beginning of my lunch was super awkward- while the food was good and the waitress was very nice--as a a mom taking her two year old out for lunch, this was way more stressful than it should have been.",

I came this past Sunday for happy hour. $4 Bloody Mary's and $3 mimosas. Worth a shot, right?  The Vig clearly has character. With the dim lighting and a full bar when you walk in is very inviting. I agree it can be a bit pricy so I wouldn't come for food.  I love me a Bloody Mary. Easily the best stocked Bloody Mary bar I've been too! And the mimosas are very good too! If anyone from the Vig management is reading this you gotta give Brandon a shout. He was our server for the evening and he was outstanding. Funny, quick, and attentive without being over bearing.  Although I will not come for food you best your money I'll be back again on Sunday!",

Something else I love about the place: great happy hours prices on a satisfactory variety of beer and alcohol.  I'd say this place's service is pretty standard and unremarkable (which I prefer because I'd rather just not focus on restaurant employees in general).  I dislike being here on nights with live music but that's a personal preference too.  The only reason I can't give the place five stars is that their parking is pretty inconvenient during peak times as a valet only or a walk from a nearby office parking lot.",

Realize your uber customers are your real life customers too. If uber is not successful for your business just don't do it. It's all good.

Skirt steak, fries, chimichurri, and pico de gallo.  It would have been nice if they said it came with pico.  It wasn't in the description on the menu.  With everything in one bowl, the pico on top made a good portion of the fries soggy.  I also am not a fan of pico flavored french fries.  If I would have known it came pico, I would have asked them to hold the pico.  When leaving, I saw many tables with thin frites.  They looked great and I think it would have been great to have those instead of the fries that came with the dish.  Next time I'll see about switching fries.  Overall, I liked The Vig.

No food was consumed since we already had dinner but the menu was read with envy.  Such a trendy place!  It was super busy, the bar was gorgeous, and the place itself was lovely.  The patio looked really nice from what I could see.  The stylish patrons made me feel under-dressed but whatever.  Give me my draaank!  Music was blasting for this energetic crowd and there were lots of couples on dates.  Kazi didn't enjoy her Bloody Mary and the waitress let her trade it for a Moscow Mule with no grief.  $4 Tito's vodka all summer long, kiddos.  Yes!  Our table already had a trivia game in place so that was fun.  We sucked at it but it was still fun.  Thanks for the bev, Tomcat!",

We ate nachos with pork and ordered no green onions so they put the guacamole, pico and sour cream and the side, I think they were being condescending but I couldn't really tell. There was nothing wrong with them, besides having to build every bite, but they were unimpressive. Pork was tender but lacked flavor and it seemed like we could have made them a thine with cans and at least had them still be crispy. GF had Mac n cheese with chorizo and broccoli added but again nothing great. Lastly, I had the smoked chicken club and it was the best thing but still not going to race back for it.   Sum it up, Good service, ok food, excellent beer= 3 outta 5  I wish it was as good as the menu reads!",

It doesn't take much more than some nice meat on some nice bread to make an out of this world sandwich. A sandwich fit for a king and queen should be thoughtfully laid out with ingredients that add up to a filling meal, but the most important thing is that all should be of excellent quality. To season your sandwich, simply salt and pepper the meat, and that's it. You get all the zing you need from glazing the sauteed vegetables with a little steak sauce added right to the pan. That's all you have to do to it. The waitstaff serving you should be trusted charming and beautiful.  If you answered \"The waitstaff needs to be trusted, charming and beautiful\" you are correct. ***See photo attachment***",

Their kitchen was open, so we checked it out around midnight on a Saturday.   Very modern, very hip-- almost trying too hard to be so, but it was cool. DJ playing dance music was alright.   Most importantly, the service was good, the did was good, the drinks were stiff, and it was very affordable. A place like this in San Francisco would have $8 well cocktails and $5.50 Bud Lights. Here they were $4.50 and $3.50.  Nachos with pork were amazing, the sliders aren't just a miniature burger type thing, they're good sized and are absolutely delicious.   Great spot!",

    "text": "I use to be a big fan of the vig.....but over the last year they're service has dropped significantly and tonight was enough! I called and placed an order for take out. Was told 20 min it'll be ready for pick up. I waited 25 min to arrive hoping it was ready. It took 10 min for me to get bartenders attention and was told I must have called another location they didn't have my order. I confirmed I called THIS location. After hassling with it for 20 min they didn't have my order so I placed it again. Hostesses and bartenders are too busy, some on their Phone to give me any attention, I had to go out myself to get their attention to get some water while I wait. I have upcoming events that I need to host somewhere, and the vig has a great patio, but I can't afford my guests to experience these issues I've had time and time again as the service gets increasingly worse.  Perhaps coincidence, but since they've opened more locations, the service and slightly the food quality has diminished.  Ran into one of the manager who said he hasn't seen me in a while, said he won't see me again soon! I was told to contact the GM about my issues....cause apparently they can't make things right for tonight's fiasco?! I'll be calling with my complaint, but sorry Vig, you've lost a regular and use to be happy patron!",

Now they have their own parking problem and provide valet during busy hours.  Anticipating what turned out to be a non problem I parked in the underutilized lot on the Southwest corner of the intersection.  I LOVE the space.  Our group of ten was seated at a long table on the \"patio\".  This space can be open to the air or heated or cooled as necessary.  The main interior can be wide open or closed off from the patio.  The patio area also has a second bar that can serve when they are busy.  I had the Vigazz burger.  The burger was really good but I would hesitate to call it great.  The sweet potato fries I chose were perfectly cooked.  The Bloody Mary was OK and the iced tea was pretty weak.  I also had a chance to try the guacamole, I liked it but I thought it could be seasoned some more.   Most of us had portions that we either had to abandon or take home.   The service was great.  The bathroom seemed a little weird, They were clean enough, the sink was a modern sloped design but they had old style folding towel dispensers.  I would certainly go back here again.",

When it comes to food, I wasn't impressed at all. Ceasar salad is good and that's about it. Other menu items I tried are just plain average - in one word disappointing. Had Vigazz burger, Salmon salad, The Trifecta - only thing in common for all of them is that they vere very bland and missing taste. However Vig Pinot Noir is highly recommended. I will be back",

    "text": "To celebrate our 2 year anniversary, my boyfriend and I thought it would be a good idea to treat ourselves to dinner at the place we had our first date exactly 2 years ago.  I tried making a reservation prior to our arrival in hopes to make the night as smooth as possible.  Unfortunately, even after mentioning that it was for our anniversary, I was informed by the hostess who answered my phone call that they did not accept reservations for parties less than 8.  Kind of odd to me seeing how it makes it hard for their customers to have an intimate celebration.  Seems like this company is a little more concerned about making their dollar than our experience.  Regardless of the lack of accommodating my request for said reservation we still decided to travel to have dinner here.  Due to the fact that we couldn't make a reservation, I made it a point to arrive 30 minutes earlier than the time I had wanted to set the reservation just to make sure we got a table in a timely manner (was informed by the hostess that we should be fine without a reservation and if there was a wait it wouldn't be longer than 15 minutes...very reassuring) and was able to make it to the other things we had planned.  When we walked in it wasn't very busy and made me feel a little better about not being able to make the reservation.  We decided to sit at the bar and ended up sitting in the last two seats available that just so happened to be almost the same two seats that we had sat in on our very first date two years ago.  Excited by the coincidence we sat and waited for our experience to begin.  And so we sat, and sat and watched as the \"busy\" bartender walked behind the bar and casually made a few drinks here and there.  The funniest part about this was the fact that he went out of his way to not make eye contact with us.  We were sitting at the very middle of the bar, so he had to try pretty darn hard to.  There was a pair of ladies sitting next to us sipping on some martinis and he decided to instead greet us and hand us some menus, but to ask if they wanted another round.  After they responded yes, he walked right past us again, did not make eye contact or say hello and continued to casually make their martinis.  At this point my boyfriend and I decided that said bartender did not think our money was good enough for him, but for the sake of our anniversary we decided to leave our seats at the bar and ask the hostess for a table.  When I told the hostess that we decided to move to a table because the bartender seemed a little too busy with his measly 15 seat bar to tend to us, her response was \"Oh sorry, yeah he's been a little grumpy today.\"  If you don't like your job, man up and find another.  The service at the bar was a little better.  The server was a bit boring, but was able to cover the basics like say hello.  Unfortunately she didn't get the idea that we wanted to enjoy our appetizer before receiving our entrees and after a few bites of our appetizer we were apparently ready for our entrees that seemed to had been delivered by a manager (saw some keys on her arm).  We VERY awkwardly accepted them.  The manager that dropped off the food apparently did not notice the almost untouched appetizer and proceeded to leave us with our rushed meal.  All in all it was an uncomfortable experience.  This is a big change from the service I used to get from here, but it had been awhile since I had come in.  Needless to say I won't be rushing back here anytime soon, there are too many great, unique restaurants in the area with staff that actually enjoy their occupation.",

Some stuff is vegetarian. The service is usually alright, nothing special.   The thing I enjoy the most about the Uptown location is the architecture. The back of the restaurant has huge, huge windows that keep you distracted when you just can't ogle whoever you're with any longer. There is a turf strip inside (and thankfully out of the way of) the restaurant in the back where you can play cornhole (that beanbag tossing game goes by a few different names I've heard) with your friends.   Apparently the happy hour rules. Too bad I've never made it on time. This place gets pricey quickly.   I'd probably take my mother here if I wanted to pretend like I was fancy.",

Last time the server not only took an hour to get orders and food out, but it was cold too.  They were not busy.  We ordered from the lunch specials and he charged us for drinks which come with the lunch special.  He also told me I could pick any side but charged me for the side.  Asked me if i wanted to pay with the CC I gave him to hold my order(wtf?) without me looking at the bill.  I said as long as the drink isn't on there.  So I guess he charged me for the side instead.  When I questioned him about it he seemed to not care at all.  Terrible service.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant with high expectations. Maybe that was the problem.  For months, my husband and I had wanted to go to The Vig because we've always driven by, and it looks really cool. So we finally decided to just knock it off our \"to try\" list and go one Saturday night.  The place is cool. It seems like a fun atmosphere. The cocktail list looked promising, but they ended up being a bit too sweet for me. No biggie, right?  Well, the real issue is with the food. There is nothing unique or exciting or amazingly delicious on the menu. It's regular American food that you can find anywhere. Nothing special. But, you'd think that, if the restaurant wanted to differentiate themselves from a nearby Applebee's, they'll cook the traditional American style food a little differently, or better, right?  Not the case. The food was boring. I mean, really  boring. Their sides of potatoes come straight out of a plastic baggie that has been steamed/microwaved in the back. Spoiler alert - this is exactly what Applebee's does. My sandwich was blah, my husband's tacos were dull, and we had to ask three different people for our sides when they had been wrong when our meals were first brought out.  I was actually really disappointed in the experience. I'm glad we tried The Vig, because we had wanted to, but now we know that there is nothing special about this place at all, and that we can get food much better at many other places nearby.",

I can only imagine how difficult/annoying it can be to have larger parties who come at different times, leave at different times, and pay separately but this place has their ish together and I really enjoyed my time with friends. Beyond all this, the food was good and the drinks were GREAT!! For all my friends that had not been there before, they were impressed by all aspects of The Vig. Thank y'all for making my day stress free and fun.",

So our party including execs had to sit at the 'community table' which my manager was not excited about, thanks, Vig.  Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.  Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.  My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.  Also, who thought that putting chipotle in everything on the menu was a good idea? Not thrilled, not going back and certainly not recommending this for any corporate or group outings.Really disappointed, I've always heard good things about The Vig and enjoyed going to the bar there.",

They were served as a trio of minis, with lots of cilantro crumbed on top (note to self: next time I order these, ask them to hold the cilantro).   While I thought the dish was very good, and the presentation was nice, the actual pieces of fish were tiny. Granted these were mini tacos, but I had expected to have large helpings of the fish. So although I was disappointed, the prices are reasonable enough that I basically got what I paid for.  This place is hopping. Trendy, loud, full of activity and with a nice patio out back where you can eat or just sit and relax with a drink while you wait for your table. A second bar is in the patio so you don't have to look too far to get your drink on.",

The cranberries on the sandwich are a nice touch! As much as I enjoy the food I always have to think twice before going because I know the service will be god awfully slow. The wait staff have no sense of urgency (especially the male waiters) and they act like they are inconvenienced by having to wait on you. THIS IS CONSISTENT EVERY SINGLE TIME, never fails. One time we sat there for 30+minutes and the food never came so we had to take it to go. The only reason I keep going back is the great food, I just have to mentally be prepared for terrible service.",

I cant remember which salad I ate, but it was so good. Either way, you'll be satisfied with the food options. Alcoholic drinks are good as well.

I ask if the waiter recommends the salad or salmon which she responded she's just not an overall salmon eater so the salad but I get the salmon anyways.  My hunny goes for his usual turkey pretzel bun sandwich.  My salmon was cooked & seasoned nicely with fresh prepared accompaniments.  His sandwich was Delish as always.

Trust me, for a long time, as I kept seeing \"The Vig\" constantly pop up on my Facebook newsfeed, I instantly thought this place was just a trendy restaurant.   Shame on me for randomly judging because The Vig is by far one of my absolute favorite restaurants.   The atmosphere is relaxing but fun. It definitely has a bar type feel but the Uptown location is much larger than the original location off of Indian School. It has about three times the number of booths and a huge outdoor space. The bar area is spacious and the environment itself is just really calm and modern.   The food. Can we talk about the food?! It is I-N-S-A-N-E. Try having giant tator tots stuffed with cheese. Or a queso dip that will make you scrap the bottom of the bowl. OR...THE MAC AND CHEESE. Seriously. The Vig is not messing around: they even circle for you on the menu and have a big arrow that points to it and says \"wow!\" At first I thought that was kind of arrogant and gimmicky but really, this dish is iconic.   And if pasta isn't your thing today, they have loads of sandwiches, burgers, and salads (I think). Something for everyone.   Go to The Vig. Trust me. You will LOVE IT.",

It gets really packed n crazy busy here so one time I was very upset cuz my food was taking longer than normal. An hour wait. I was pissed cuz I was starving but the general manager Andre knew how to defuse the situation n took care of my entire party. He came by our table personally and explained the situation n apologized. And for us waiting so long, he got us a round of drinks. Now that's how a manager should be.

RECENT GOOD NEWS:  - Short Rib Melt = \"TO DYE FOW-AH\" (in my best Jersey Shore Voice)  its seriously the bomb.  - ALSO: the pulled pork samich Lacie just pushed on us like a pimp (seriously, she \"skinny-shamed\" us into eating 1) and.... shut the front door- its yum-delish.....  YUP, ITS THAT GOOD.  - Speakin of Lacie-??? Shut every door in the house. Best wgin in the Vig since Heather, Jen P, and Megan, fer reals.  ... maybe, just maybe, they bring back the Carne Asada on A Potatoe Pancake, and Logan...

    "text": "Brunch! I always get there early especially with a group just because it can fill up, this particular weekend morning it was not bad no wait. Here is a tip I learned the parking lot right outside \"bank parking only\" signs are all over, I am pretty sure the VIG Uptown used to be a bank so the signs are a carryover, it deterred me at first but my friends have never been towed. $3 mimosas and a pretty good brunch menu. The decor is cool I love their ceiling murals I had to snap a picture of that one at a different table. Service is usually good, drink refill orders took a while and when we told our server we are waiting for a few more people, I assume our server took this as we are waiting to order food (understandable) which initially we were but 30 minutes later we decided we were just going to order and alas now our server was nowhere to be found, super nice and professional but MIA a lot. Breakfast sandwich was pretty standard, potatoes were good I sometimes have a love/hate relationship with their potatoes. My partner had the enchiladas Del Pollo, shredded chicken, corn tortillas cream and white cheddar over eggs. It was so good! I am going to order that for sure next time. Menu is bigger than a lot of brunch menus so that's always a plus people can have a good selection of sweet or savory.",

    "text": "I like that the Vig locations around the valley have a different feel and vibe to it. The Vig Uptown has a modern, casual atmosphere to it. It's your typical dim lighted bar with chill music which I can't say about The Vig Filmore. Both locations are awesome depending on what you're looking for.  We came here for dinner last night and sat at the patio to watch the game. Honestly I feel like The Vig has one of the best nachos ever. Everything in their nachos is quality - we always like to add shredded chicken. For dinner, I ordered their famous mac and cheese with short ribs. Everyone at the table had a bite of my dish because it was incredible. It wasn't overwhelmingly tasty like other mac and cheese dishes. The pasta was cooked perfectly and served in an iron  skillet. You can order their burgers or sandwiches and upgrade your side to a mac and cheese or pozole for just $3. So worth it! My boyfriend always orders the pozole. I am not a fan of pozole in general but The Vig makes it so well.   For drinks, our server misunderstood my order and gave me a Four peaks peach ale instead of the AZ peach shandy. She took the drink off our bill when she realized her mistake but I actually liked the four peaks peach ale more so than what I ordered. I wasn't a big fan of the AZ peach Shandy and would probably not order it again.   The service is always great at the Vig. They also have complementary valet.",

He made sure that the restaurant compensated me with a gift coupon for the amount I spent and actually called a couple of times to make sure I received it. Also custom made a vegan stir fry (which was delicious) and edamame when I went to pick my gift certificate up. Great customer service and given how the restaurant ensured they made the situation right makes me want to go back for sure.   Older review -  Just ordered for the first time from the Vig through uber eats. I'm so disappointed with the restaurant. I specifically asked for a veg black bean burger with no cheese but instead I got a BEEF burger which I almost bit into. It's just so wrong.......  to add insult to injury I was placed on a long never ending hold when I tried to call the restaurant to tell them about their mistake.",

In a previous life, the building was a bank; I love that they respected the integrity of this mid-century modern building by keeping a lot of the original structure - the outside bar used to be the drive-thru teller window! They did a great job the overall design both inside and out - the atrium area is a wonderful place for large groups to gather. Being a former bank, so be forewarned that there isn't much parking available - love the valet option!  I wish I was as enthusiastic about the food. Generally speaking, although there is a variety of menu offerings, it's all pretty much upscale bar food. It was good, no complaints, rather just average and nothing special or outstanding.   The staff was friendly, and our waitress personable and attentive. The place is pretty noisy, though - so if you are looking for a place for a quiet conversation, this isn't it.  Will I go back? Sure but probably only for drinks. It may be over hyped, but it's got a great atmosphere and great libations.",

He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!  So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.  I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.",

The giant indoor patio has got to be a pleasant spot to enjoy a good meal even if its a hot day in the desert.  The patio and the dining room are both quite spacious.  When you have a sandwich on the menu called best turkey sandwich, you better be able to back it up.  The Vig certainly does.  It really shouldn't be anything you haven't had before, but the pretzel bun takes it to a whole-nother level.  I would like to thank the Vig for helping to prove my theory that everything tastes better on pretzel bun.  And if you want a great deal, you can save a few bucks at the Vig Uptown with local dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=3b565d2feddc9611106a5f381cdfc79375def3cf80dc25cda3383cd62ceed3ed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>).

They asked our group to wait by the bar which left no room for anyone to get by us while they got our table ready. After waiting 30 minutes, they finally escorted us to a lounge area with sofas and coffee tables. After much discussion, they concluded there was nothing else the could do to accomodate us. Our group called a competitor who gladly accomodated us within 30 minutes with a private room and dedicated wait staff. We spent $1400 at the competitor that night.

The courtyard with the cornhole arena is an excellent touch. And the food... Well the food was dec.  I had ordered the hangover helper, a monstrous plate atop of which sat a tower of chilaquile layered with pork, cheese, sour cream, and housemade salsa. Then nested above this foundation were two over easy eggs. Was I served a plate of food or a work of art?  And upon first bite, the flavors were very good. The textures were varied - starchy tortilla against gooey cheese and shredded pork. And the housemade salsa made everything taste incredibly fresh.   But then halfway through the dish, I found the flavors began to lose their pop. The dish became heavily reliant on the salsa to sustain itself. It had very quickly begun overstaying its welcome... The chefs here must learn that less is more. While great proportions is generally appreciated, sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good. Pride is not the opposite of shame, it is the source. And the only True antidote to both is humility.  I'd definitely go back here but not for brunch. Rumor has it that they have a mean set of burgers that I'd love to sink my carnivorous teeth into...  To be continued...",

Hard to believe it used to be a bank!. Brandon was our very cheerful and patient server. Informed us that the signature cocktails were only $5.00 as compared to the usual $10.00. Sweet! I ordered the chim chereau (sp?) And my guy order a beer. We had the calamari. Pretty good considering we are both west-coast seafood snobs. (sorry, we are- don't hate)  I then ordered the classic burger and he had the blackened chicken blt. We were both very pleased. My burger was very, very good on a nice toasty brioche bun. His sandwich was very big and I loved his fries. I had ordered the onion rings, and as with many places they make those huge thick rings that unfortunately I really just don't like. Not their fault, but would really love to see those uber thin fairy-like onion rings in more places.  I ordered a second cocktail to be told that they had run out of ingredients to make it. Sigh. Brandon suggested a replacement, that was not bad, but reminded me a bit of my grandmothers perfume.   I will go back. Would like to sit on the patio, however the musician they had playing was so loud I had trouble talking over him inside let alone being out there. Check it out. Next time will try the charcuterie platter!",

Jazz was so engaging to us and made me have faith that the Vig is back on point the service  we received is why I must   rate my evening a 5 star experience.   Ashley another employee always greets me with a friendly hello and is who I usually request if I'm dining away from the bar I'm very picky and her expertise really helps me with my food choices and special requests which  I do admit I make often.

I ordered a mango Ciroc and Sprite and the Sprite was so flat it tasted like Mango water in 3 minutes (that's me being generous). I told the waitress and her reply was \"Do you want to try something else?\" I didn't want to be rude but in my head I'm thinking \"Umm no ma'am I would've asked for something else if I wanted to try something else\"! She didn't even offer to get me another since the first one was so bad I mean what's the point of mixing your liquor if the \"mix\" taste like water?  As for food I got a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it. First of all this was the sloppiest burger I've had in my life there was more cheese on the burger than there was meat! The French fries were cold and I mean cold and they were hard. I mean hard like stale saltine cracker hard. I was so disgusted by then I just paid and left. The only thing that tasted like it was supposed to taste was the Water and those mints at the front! I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of food here. I should've complained but I had to be somewhere to be. Long story short this is the worst food and service I've had in Phoenix!",

Both are personable and charming yet completely down to earth. My girlfriend and I have had our fair share of crappy service where we've been forgotten about and dismissed. Who wants to spend their hard-earned income just to be disappointed. Not only were we given options, but recommendations were made. CJ and Ashley treated us like friends not just another visitor. Michelle the manager is just as sweet and inviting like CJ and Ashley. Ashley recommended the Thai Sweet Chili Wings which are sweet, crispy and and the meat deliciously tender. My girlfriend ordered the Pozole and she enjoyed every bite. CJ creates your drinks exactly as you request but will also offer suggestions pertaining to your palette. The Vig participates in local charities on a monthly basis. Great food and even greater people!",

    "text": "A group of ladies and I chose to have Brunch here today and let me tell you, the food and management was absolutely amazing! It is not often, I can go to a restaurant and they have real Ginger Ale, versus 7-Up. So that was icing on the cake for me! Management was beyond amazing. He was extremely accommodating and attentive to our needs, even after we decided last minute we wanted to be outside and closer to the live music they provide. Which ALSO was absolutely amazing. Their voices.  The energy. Amazing. I unfortunately could not leave a solid 5 stars because our waiter just was not doing it for me. I ordered a Ginger Ale the same time I ordered my food, and it seems like it didn't come out until AFTER our meals. We ordered chips and guacamole as an appetizer - which also, was AMAZING, but it too, didn't come out to our food came so we didn't get to really enjoy it like we hoped. So after our meal we asked for a ToGo box for the Guacamole & Chips and it seemed to take far to long.  Our waiter on 3 separate occasions came to our table, no box. Which I believe is unacceptable. And we could not wait any longer for one, so that was a waste. But as we were leaving and I told the waiter not to worry about it, that we had just left it on the table because we had an appointment to get to, the manager stepped in and tried to get it for us personally, which we appreciated very much and will definitely be returning, it was just too late. We were already running late. All in all, if you ever are in the neighborhood, definitely check this place out! Great restaurant!!!",

Today, I went with a female friend who's also black and our server was Kellin (according to my receipt). Kellin was a light-skinned (possibly hispanic) male with a goatee and visible tattoo showing around his neck.   My friend and I were ignored after our orders were taken and drinks served. I literally put a finger in the air to get Kellin's attention before our food came, to get a refill on my drink, at which point he looked at me twice and looked right past me. Thankfully, five minutes later our food was brought out by a different server who also offered to refill our drinks. Kellin only returned to our table after we had finished our meals to take our plates and bring us the check. So, I left a small tip on my card ($3 and change) and walked over to the server who brought us our food and refilled our drinks and gave him the $8-$9 I had in my wallet as we left the restaurant. I won't be back here to eat.",

Food runner brings out the steak and salad for dine in. Told him it's supposed to be to go. So I left with a pre-dressed salad that I threw away because it wouldn't last 12 hours in the fridge.   At least the hostess said goodbye to us. Oh wait, no she didn't. Too busy on her phone.",

Yes, they have a greasy vegetable sandwich, and Yes, they can modify many menu items to be vegetarian, but a salad with no protein, is just not exciting.  It really frustrates me when restaurants say, \"Well we can do this without the meat...\" that may have been acceptable 15 years ago, but NOT when 10% of the US population follow a vegetarian diet!  We like to eat good food too!  Sorry for ranting, but for a new restaurant that portrays a Hip/modern image, they are not living up to it.  I've been to Vig Uptown several times because my BF likes it, but last night he said his potato pancake was not very good and the portion size of his carne continues to decrease every time he orders it.  I will say that the Vig has great sangria, tasty specialty drinks, and I've always had good service.  It's hard to say I won't be back, because that's probably not True... I can say I will not be back for the food!",

Sadly, they don't have the pullled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun that's at the 40th St. location, but the Persion Chicken Kebabs more than made up for it.  Terrific draft and bottled beer selection for folks like me that like microbrewed pale ales and IPAs.  Went back with my wife and another couple for a Friday happy hour ($5 plates, drink specials) that turned into 4 hours.  Great Indian pizza and fun appetizers.  Very attentive service both times I've been there.  One word of caution -- it can get LOUD, especially at happy hour.",

    "text": "I pulled into the Vig on accident one day while meeting a friend for lunch across the street.  The building is very chic and the place looked exactly like a place I wanted to visit later. So today my fiance and I went in for lunch.  Let it first be mentioned that we checked the star rating here on Yelp...4 star...too bad we didn't read the reviews because this place was not worth the effort.  The design of the restaurant is great.  I guess I should start by saying this is not a real restaurant...this is more like a lounge with an extended menu.  Ordered the hummus, sliders, satay and pad Thai.  Hummus was not good...much better out of a jar at any supermarket.  Sliders were okay a little greasy looking.  Satay was cold...not on purpose...just not properly cooked or served.  The pad Thai was a disaster...normally we are intelligent enough to avoid ordering something like this in a mock fusion restaurant but the menu was so limited we didn't really have a choice...the noodles were so overlooked they were mushed and the dish was over spiced probably to overcompensate for the poor quality. We ordered the bread pudding to go...for the record...I love bread pudding...any bread pudding pretty much...this stuff was terrible...I literally spit it into my kitchen sink.  Beyond disappointed.  What a waste of potential. Now I have to look for someplace to deliver because I couldn't eat anything at my $80 lunch. My fiance had a \"Clemintine\" specialty cocktail...they should be embarrassed to serve something like that.",

I ordered the Turkey sandwich and my friend ordered  the Classic Ceasar. food was great but the drinks are always the best at 40th so i figured this place would be no different. I decided to order the 40th street special called Breakfast in Manhattan. Turned out they did not have any bacon for the drink there at the moment. no biggy but what made the issue much better is that the bartender came over to our table and apologized personally for not having the ingredients and made me another drink on the house.. what, free booze.. umm SCORE.. had to pay for the rest but that kinda service makes for a GREAT experience and a hell of a first impression on me. this place is a bit of a ways from me since I live in Tempe but have gone back for more and will keep going back anytime I am in the neighborhood... got my vote",

The restaurant was really busy but had a fun and relaxed feel to it. We were greeted by a bartender who instantly had us in stitches, casually making jokes and pouring drinks at lightening speed at the same time. He became our entertainment for the evening without even knowing it! I ordered the shrimp summer salad and wished that I ordered 2! I'm always looking for a good salad as the weather heats up and this very well may be my new go-to. The bartender (curly hair, red beard, can't remember his name sorry!) made me a Coug Cup Champagne cocktail. Being a self proclaimed cougar, the novelty of the drink would have delighted alone but, the cocktail turned out to be incredible. My friend had the pit beef sandwich with roast beef. He loved it and would scarcely allow me a bite to try, delicious!  I've been to the Arcadia Vig on many occasions and have never been displeased. The uptown location is a little closer to my home and I have to say I prefer it to Arcadia due to the open space and vast array of windows and lighting. The decor, music, crowd and staff all posses the perfect elements of hip without pretentiousness, bar without the sleeze, casual without the lazy and delicious without the huge price tag. Fun place, will go back for sure. If you sit at the bar, make sure you ask for Red Beard!",

After being patient with him, and waiting for him to wait on the three of us, I decided to call it a night. I do have to admit it felt like he was being a snot and was letting us know he would wait on us on his own time......Yet  I do have to say  the turkey sandwich was very good that night.....  So, when i heard my sister and parents were going to The Vig yesturday for lunch I asked if they could pick a sandwich up for me. They came home and complained how the waitress thought she was too good to be waiting on tables and she also took her time taking their order. What was the real kicker was my mom didnt like her sandwich and asked to send it back because it was too \"soggy\" it took over 20 minutes for them to make a new one. Well of course the family got upset and asked her to cancell the reorder. Soooo, what do you think she did? She gave attitude of course.  They finally came home and brought my Turkey Sandwich.... you will never guess what it had on it? READY?..... Mold!!!  I dont know what to do. After our two last experiences I cant even imagine how the management will react if I were to complain.  You can decide if you want to encounter slow, rude waiters/waitress or moldy food.",

    "text": "Yea, I would say that the place misses what the original Vig has, mainly warmth.  Food was average, not bad, nothing to dream about and want to run back for. Had steak sandwich, not that interesting, basic. 14.00 was a bit steep I thought. Signature cocktails list, all 9 bucks. Kind of steep I think in this economy. My buddy had Pad Thai, which if your going to do a varied menu and add unexpected dishes from other parts of the world, you better do it well. This was not the case. Bland. I would guess that they do not have a Wok in the kitchen, which is really needed for Asian Pad Thai, because of the high heat.  For the interior. Very masculine, needs to be warmed up. The \"patio\", is very stark. Reminded me of a waiting area at an airport, very sterile. The other odd design element is the bar area. You would think with this large space, the owners would have been licking their chops to do a large bar, especially after years of having a smaller bar at the original Vig. This is not the case at all. I think I counted 12 bar stools? They could have made the bar much larger and wrapped it into the kitchen. Really missed an opportunity. Another very odd design choice to do the front door and window in an orange plexi. The exterior light coming through gives a very odd, sort of dirty, hot orange glow, that takes away from the stained glass windows. It reminds me of a hot, polluted day over the valley in Los Angeles. Interesting, but erie at the same time. Does not make me want to eat. Strange choice. Did love the wood panels though. The acoustics are also pretty bad. Very loud, hard to have a conversation.  Hey, maybe they are aware of some of this and are already working to warm up the space. I hope so. This space just does not have what The Vig on 40th Street has. Warmth and soul.  Oh, and if you really want to read what this place is all about, read Brad H. review on his experience of The Vig, which he sees as positive. What I get from his review and where we differ is, if you like hanging out with Duesh bags that need to buy a high end ride to impress and spend way too much time in the gym, then this indeed is the place for you. No, your not going to see too many downtown urban types in this place, or hybrid cars for that matter. Its Scottsdale in Central Phoenix, thats for sure",

Lucky for me it was their one-year anniversary and I was able to score some half-off appetizers and drinks with two other gals. We ordered three appetizers and a \"couple\" drinks and our bill was $37. AWESOME. . The restaurant itself was very roomy and seemed to occupy a large amount of people.  It was neat the restaurant walls were completely open to the patio giving the place an open atmosphere.  I was really impressed by the live music, although I'm not sure if that is a normal occurance on a Sunday afternoon here. Our drinks were delicious, service was attentive. Our server and James let me charge my phone somewhere in the back and continued to remind me they had it.... not that I could forget it. I REALLY enjoyed that it was in the neighborhood of my lovely \"Phoenix\" friend Teresa who invited me, needless to say I will be back if I'm in the area.",

The new Vig has great bartenders (Ashley) and nice staff who make you feel like you're home. The food is not exceptional, but it ain't bad either. The mimosas are delic and it's nice place to just hang. BUT the reason they got three stars instead of four, is because they have the WORSE coffee ever. The only place that has nastier tasting coffee is Ticoz. I was also surprised they didn't have 2% milk for coffee drinkers (only whole and cream-dieters beware). My hope is that if I write enough of the same reviews with the same complaints, they'll switch coffee brands and have 2% (or better yet, skim) milk. My inspiration, of course, being Amber and her quest for a vegan burrito, which they now have (go Amber!). I've got my fingers crossed.",

    "text": "I have been to the original Vig  location many times and absolutely love the food.  I was a huge fan of the original menu so was not happy when they changed it up.  I agree with most all of the positive reviews of both locations.  Great food, great atmosphere, interesting menu.  I do find it to be a bit pricey, and was very disappointed when making my first visit to the \"uptown\" location that they had made the same mistake in design that they did with the original.  The acoustics are horrid!  Impossible to carry on a conversation with your companions, hearing conversations from the other end of the room, and everyone yelling to be heard.  I sent a comment to the manager at the original location about that, and even suggested a way to improve the acoustics.  It however fell on deaf ears and I was told to come at a later, less busy time.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband on a Friday night and had high expectations from the other review here and from a few friends that had been. However it was definitely one of the worst experiences that we have had at a restaurant. Once we were seated our waiter seemed very pretentious and almost put off by us. Everyone else in the restaurant seemed nice and friendly so maybe it was just bad luck. We ordered the loaded potato skins and they were room temperature but would have been to die for had they been warm all the way through. We had one left and asked him to box it for us. Then we ordered the pork sandwich and burger. Both were pretty good but the portions are huge so neither of us were even able to finish even half of our food. When our waiter finally brought us our check he mumbled and I thought he had said something about boxing our food so I said yes please and he took our card and came back with the receipt. I asked him if he would be coming back with our boxes and he said oh what and giggled, oh my goodness I had no idea that you guys wanted that and it is in the trash I'm sorry. He did ask if he could get us something else to eat but we had other plans for the evening and didn't have time to wait. Normally I would say no biggie everyone makes mistakes but his overall attitude was bad from the get go and he was very insincere and didn't seem overly interested in trying to make things better. I did love the decor and atmosphere and like I said everyone else there was very nice maybe we just got the rotten apple.",

What a turn-over wonder!! :) I must mention that I had a bad experience at the Vig Arcadia, and promised not to step foot into that place again.  However this location turned my experience with The Vig around, I came her on a Friday night to a co-workers birthday celebration! Those you can't say no to, so I came here thinking I would just sip water through out the night, but no siree. I really enjoyed the vibe, the music and the staff was ever so nice and friendly. Plus the food was delicious, I had some of the cheesy tater tots, YUM!! As well as one of their Hot Vings, wow were those sticky and spicy, but good!  Also just half of a Hot Chick sandwich and an Arnold Palmer!! Oh so delicious!!!  I was really glad I came and that this place took me by surprise!! The food was great and the staff here was just as good!! Great time with the co-workers and friends!! :)",

    "text": "My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down.  Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind.",

Both experiences have topped the downtown location. The food is fantastic (we had the short rib taco, the lean steak salad and the salmon) all of which are highly recommended! The highlight is the food for sure, especially the short rib! Not only that, but there is complimentary vallet ( please tip), the crowd is manageable and tolerable ( not the yard, which has made us divert to the vig, and happily) but there is also bocce ball!  One of the favorites. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks. Expect some slow service. But it's worth it!!!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and really love this place!  The first time I went was for a social with the Phoenix Social Club. It's such a trendy/hip yet relaxed place that I felt comfortable among the sea of people! It felt a little crowded around the bar but in the back room with the very high ceilings I felt much less claustrophobic!   So that's my 2 cents about going to The Vig Uptown for a few drinks. The rest is based off my date night.  The Ambiance: As I mentioned earlier it's very urban and trendy but super comfortable. There was a good mix of people and sizes of parties. I'm pretty sure my date and I talked about the layout of the restaurant and the styling for about 15 minutes of the date! It's just such a cool mix of industrial and comfortable! I really love that there's the open \"grassy\" area in the back of the patio/restaurant area. People can play a little bags or bocce ball. The only thing I didn't love about that was the fact that some of the people playing the games got a little rowdy which in a bar type situation is fine but when you're having dinner right next to the \"court\" - not so perfect.  The food: I got the Turkey sandwich on the pretzel bread and it was actually really great! I'm usually not a huge fan of any coleslaw type thing but it was just the right amount to complement the rest of the ingredients! Our waitress painted the sweet potato fries to be something ground breaking and wonderful - so they were kind of a disappointment just because of all of her hype. Don't get me wrong they were really good but I feel like every place I go now claims to have the best sweet potato fries... I also thought the price wasn't too bad either! (Yay for good, affordable food for the hungry college kid!)  Service: One of the reasons I loved it so much! From the valet, to the bartender and the waitress to the rest of the staff I was impressed with how friendly everyone was. Our waitress was really patient with the fact that my date and I pretty much weren't ready to order for about 30 minutes (I'm sure that would be trying for anyone's patience!)   Overall: I think this is a great date night restaurant! It's a good hip vibe while still being a nice enough place to impress a date! I think one of the highest testaments to The Vig Uptown was the fact that we were there for almost 3 hours. We felt like we were taken care of the entire time and never felt rushed or that we needed to leave.",

Happy hour, brunch, cheap wine and fresh fruit Sundays, and yep... $5.00 burgers and fries after 6:00 on Monday... it's a no-brainer.  I'll admit that the reason we moved into the amazing neighborhood that 16th Street and Bethany Home has become is due, in significant part, to the Vig.  Like they say \"Let's just go to the Vig!\"  Although I am stumbling distance from this brilliant looking establishment that reminds me of a modernized Brady Bunch rumpus room, it's really the whole experience that has won me over.  Even the menu is basement casual with an uptown slant... from the Deconstructed Fish Taco Salad, to the Holy Mac N' Cheese, or the Legalize Pot Roast it really ties the room together, man.  The Trifecta is their slider platter, which hits the pallino every time and as my father-in-law put it \"has the perfect meat to bun ratio.\"  My Tip:  Slip into the \"faux patio\" for some brilliant Bocce Ball court play.",

Ordered the deconstructed fish tacos and hoped for the best. They were actually, delicious!  Even more surprising was that the side of black beans was well spiced and delicious as well. Just enough pineapple was added to the dish- fresh greens- great. I would just knock off points for the sort of flavorless guacamole and the pale and tasteless diced tomato. I would also suggest that they use actual sized corn tortillas. The dish came with three VERY small corn tortillas. Enough for three small bites or two big ones- kind of silly to spend time making a fish taco on such a small tortilla.  Just make them regular sized and fix the guacamole and this dish would be out of this world. Also, the fish for the taco came out kind of cold- not warm or hot.  Still, the deconstructed fish taco was otherwise so well done that I will be back to try some more.   Service was prompt.   Really do like the atmosphere and the grown up- but not stuffy- vibe at lunch. Will have a drink next time as well!",

We were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio. I know this is such a girl thing to say, but I love their bathroom sinks!   For starters we got the crab & artichoke dip. It was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people. The spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing. I also got a cocktail, captain appleseed. It smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking. For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.  Total (not including tip) for a cocktail, an app, 2 entrees & dessert was about $57. A lil pricey but the food was great so I'd say it's worth it!",

I told her I am not going to the Vig again, she said she was buying and she had her heart set on going. I figured it has been a long time and maybe I got them on an off night. So we went.  Then it was down hill from there. 15 minutes for our ditsy size 0 server to arrive. She was more concerned with texting and flirting with another table of three guys, to be concerned with us. This is the 2nd time I have gotten an idiot server here and I have only been here twice. I will revisit the server after I speak on the food.   The food took forever & they were not very busy, 27 minutes! For a Tandoori Shrimp salad , that they forgot to put shrimp on & the Frenchy well I think this sandwich would definitely offend the French. There was very little meat and it was way over cooked. Then it was another 10 minutes for my friend to get her shrimp!   Back to the server..... Wouldn't you notice when bringing the food to the table that a Shrimp salad had no shrimp?! I mean she took the order, she entered the order and she delivered the order. When we told her um excuse me isn't this salad supposed to have grilled shrimp? She replied \" oh yea, it's not under the lettuce?\" then she left and came back after 10 minutes with the shrimp. No apology nothing!  Vig quit thinking you are the only game in town, I will not be back even if someone else pays!  The only good thing here in my opinion is the building. Step up your service and your food quality and you would be great!",

The vibe in this place is super cool and laid back. If you make the correct decision and check this place out, tell them you support Arizona School for the Arts. They are donating 15% of their profits to my school.   We met two of our fav people at The Vig at 4pm on Friday. The drink menu is fun and unique. The girls chose a drink with strawberry and basil. Sound interesting? It was. After one of those drinks, we switched it up and tried the Sucker Punch. I am not sure what was in that drink, but it was a little piece of Heaven! The food was great. We snacked on chips and guac and potato skins topped with a cheese doodle.   The service was phenomenal. Our server was prompt and friendly. We will definitely return to The Vig!

I actually interviewed for a job here when it was a Bank of America. I can tell they have done an amazing job yet I like they kept some of the previous details like the stained glass.   Now on to the important part...the food. To start out with I had the Take Bethany home drink and it was light and refreshing. For dinner, I ordered the Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa and it was sooo delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was really tasty. My fiance had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was a huge portion and I tried some of his fries and they were great. The only reason I gave The Vig uptown 4 stars is, while the service is friendly, it is very slow. After our waitress took our order we didn't see her again for the rest of the night. I would have ordered another cocktail but she was MIA.",

I've been to this location at least 4 times and it's the service that is questionable. A patron should not finish a meal, cover their plates with napkins and wait 15 minutes for the server to ask if either more food is desired or if the party is ready for the check. We waited another 10 minutes for the server to come back for the check before just heading to the bar to pay for the meal. Ok food, inefficient service. The Fillmore location has better service.",

I really enjoyed the process of watching the owners transform this great piece of historic modern architecture into something a lot of people could enjoy.   The other location is cool too, sans the DB scene. I found this location to have scary parking, but good valet service.   The service was good on my Friday 3pm visit. Was there to celebrate a friends birthday. We had some of the apps (The Trifecta, Double Down, and Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip) and they were good. The waitress was always coming by to check on us and even told us when happy hour started.   You could tell it was getting close to 5pm. The place was a mad house with 40 something dudes trolling for a place to sit all sweaty from a golf outing. The place is chill and there seemed to be no pretencious DB's. Sure there is a healthy mix of an older crowd, but there was a good mix of younger groups too.   Good amount of TVs so there is always something to watch. It was kind of noisy near the enclosed patio, but we were at a table being loud anyways. There is alot of room to move and enjoy the space, and not to be bumped into. I have only visited just once for a Friday happy hour, stay tuned for a dinner visit.",

My wife had the Vigan, and we shared the Cheesy Tater Tots. Everything formed a kind of lifeless ambiguity of flavor. Their Jalapeno Creme was seriously just green sour cream. I've had much better food elsewhere. The price was not worth the uninspired dishes.",

Though I am sure the Uptown would prefer some wait because that would mean more people, more money, etc.  Back to the Uptown: great trendy layout with a sweet indoor patio that gives the illusion of being outside without the sweltering heat or desert night cold.  The menu is eclectic drawing inspiration from Thai, Indian, American and Mexican cuisines.  My favorite are the Nachos.  They are ginormous and packed with every ingredient you might ever want topping chips.  The sweet potato fries are also delightful.  They have a few specials, which elude me now, but I remember one involves 20 bucks for wine and an appetizer.  Also they have Hoegaarden on tap which is a plus.",

The food here is OK-they have some unique creations that you're bound to enjoy. They also serve up some tasty cocktails and have a nice selection of beer. The enclosed patio is really cool and the bocce ball court back there lends itself to some fun times. I'm giving three stars because while the food is good, it's not great. And the attitude from some of the servers is at times cold if not snobby. I know you work in a cool place, but come on-lose the attitude. Despite that, this is a fun place to hang and definitely worth a visit.",

He's easy on the eyes, knows how to make a solid cocktail and is incredibly friendly- he remembered me and my friends names! Another tip- always go with the pretzel bun- yum- for sandwiches.. but they also offer gluten free bread they make in house for $2 extra. I went for the Grilled Chicken BLT(on pretzel bread) with a side of Brussel sprouts with parmesan. I was very pleased- however would likely add avocado next time!! My friend Renee ordered the hummus appetizer, which is served with dried cranberries, figs, zucchini, squash, olives and pita- she subbed tortilla chips for the pita bread, as she has a diet that necessitates exclusion of gluten. They offer signature cocktails for $6 during HH 3-6pm.. and they have an amazing list!!!! They also were running a $5 Tito's drink special, and have $4 well drinks or discounted wine and beer for HH. All parking is valet, so bring cash for tip. Can't wait to come back again  2 large, easy to see TVs in the bar area, and some fun games on a patio for when it gets a little cooler!",

The cocktail waitress was busy playing grab-ass with one guy at the end of the bar most of the time I was here. The steak and sprouts were OK.  Nothing special.  I am still hungry.

The server came back and poured what I had ordered into the glass containing the rest of the wine I didn't like. What? No, not ok. I then ordered the harvest salad, which was supposed to contain several ingredients. When I had not encountered the farro and could not find it anywhere, I told the server there was supposed to be farro on the salad. She proceeded to point her pen into my salad to direct my attention to the seven grains of farro under the pile of spinach. Then she told me it's an ancient grain. She must have said \"ancient\" three or four times. I guess \"ancient\" equals \"invisible.\" I just said \"ok, thanks.\" I mean, what can you say? I few minutes later, I realized the Brussels sprouts were also invisible, but I didn't want to hear about their origin, so I didn't bother.",

The bar is people-friendly with generous space in all the booths. There are a number of different areas in which to eat. Outside in the front may be a little noisy. In the back you can enjoy the crisp sound of bocce balls cracking together.  The food is excellent. You can have a plain old hamburger and fries or you can elect to partake of a turkey sandwich and roasted broccoli or even try some of their spicy pozole. Try the special Vig burger with a fried egg for a change.  Happy hour lasts until 6 pm.   When we arrived at 5:55 pm I did not expect to get a Happy Hour drink at a Happy Hour price but I did.

    "text": "More bad than good. Here is the skinny on the Vig uptown: 1. You have to valet park. Valet said owner parked in wrong spot so you can't get out of lot without a lot of effort. Bad. 2. The facility is great. They have big comfortable booths, a great patio, and a long bar.  - Good. 3. All the staff seem like they would rather be someplace else. We have never felt so rushed to order and so rushed to finish. The servers spent most of their time flirting with the bartender instead of cleaning the tables or filling glasses. I was sat at a booth that still had crumbs and greasy spots.- Bad 4. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a burger medium and it came well. No return visit from the server. The fries are thin, crisp, and hot but covered with sugary seasoning. SUGAR DOES NOT GO ON FRIES. Isn't there enough diabetes already? Chicken sandwich was grissled. - Bad.  Good service can overcome bad food, but good food cannot overcome bad service.   Strangely enough, the McMillan in Flagstaff is owned by the same group and we love it every time. Skip the Vig. Go to the Phoenix City Grill across the street. Better food and great service.",

We went around 4:30, and surprisingly it was not busy at all! Valet got our car parked immediately and we sat ourselves.   Our waitress was very attentive, and always checked up on us regularly.   Since it was happy hour, we took advantage of the $6 drinks and ordered two over our stay. This isn't necessarily a complaint, but the waitress did not ID my guest. And he definitely looks under 40, definitely (he is legal drinking age, I just think the restaurant should be aware of this).   Both of our ordered were absolutely delicious. I got the Calamari as my main order and it is seriously the best I've ever had. The meat to bread ratio is perfect. Plus the sauce for dipping is amazing too! Absolutely no complaints.  Overall, I would definitely recvommend the Vig to anyone. For two drinks (happy hour), an app and one main sandwich-we got out for only $40 which is a great deal!",

Chicken nachos $5 monday burger  The service can be kind of slow at all locations, but I've noticed it most at Uptown.

I have had better fish tacos for sure. 2 larger ones would have trumped the 4 small 1 piece fish tacos with very  little sauce flavor. And it was sooo busy.

Just walking into the establishment we could tell we were going to get great service by the friendly hellos the staff gave us. Christian, our waiter/bartender, was personable and quick to show up to the booth we picked out ourselves. I liked that he took our entire order (drinks, apps, and entrees) without writing any of it down. He was a great server and even added in a \"Wha-bam!\" every time he brought something to the table. My girlfriend, who drinks water like a fish, never had an empty glass.  I got the Short Rib tacos which were melt in your mouth tender and marinaded to perfection. My girlfriend got the fish tacos and liked them so much she didn't want to share them with me! Halfway through the meal another bartender stopped by and dropped off a free shot of whiskey which just seemed to be the cherry on top of a great experience.  I'll mention again we were visiting the Vig on my girlfriend's 1 hour lunch break and had no issues receiving our full order quickly so she could get back to work on time. After Christian took a moment out of his day to thank us for giving The Vig a try and give us their daily specials we decided to make this spot our go-to for lunch dates!  Christian, if you happen to read this, we look forward to seeing you again soon! Thanks for the fantastic service.",

Well anyways I like this place so far. They have awesome lunch and happy hour deals and the staff they had serving us was very nice. I really do like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Pretty awesome place with pretty awesome food. TRY THAT MAC N CHESEE!!! :-)",

The bartenders and slow waiters take themselves way too seriously, and bless their hearts if they don't mess up your order. The design is great, valet is fun, and the DJs often play too loud.",

When my friends arrived we ordered. Turns out she was the bar server as well. She forgot to bring out our wine, & put my order in wrong.  On top of that there was a nail sticking out of the bottom of the table that kept catching on my friends shirt. She told us she would get a piece of tape or something to cover it right away. She never did... She seemed to be very into the men that were sitting at the bar & kinda forgot about us. She was always happy & cheerful don't get me wrong, but \"Pre-occupied\" with the men at the bar.  Now our food ... Everything was fantastic! sweet potato fries were great, Hot chick sandwich, delish! Roasted turkey sandwich on pretzel bread, amazing! Mahi Mahi sandwich, filling!  Overall despite the fact our bar server/waitress kinda forgot about us... Our experience was good.  We would go back!",

    "text": "Like the original Vig in \"Arcadia Baja\", this newest location is one of my fave, elegant, mature, yet fun places to hang, nosh, nibble and imbibe.  The parking's just as bad (except I like the valets at this location), so you really don't have to worry about it.  Just drop off your keys and go.  This location is decidedly larger, much larger patio, yet retains the cool vibe of the original (except you can actually locomote to the bathroom in this location without spilling someone's drink). The concept scaled well, IMHO.  Food is fantastic.  Everything I've had has been great; innovative pairings of flavors and textures. The happy hour menu changes daily I believe, if not weekly and there's always something adventurous to try.  Full bar and good selection of beers on tap.  I usually get a draft Stella (or 5 ) when I'm there, but you'll not be wont for lack of beverage options.  Best aspects -- a tossup between decor & service. Both are phenomenal.  This is a great place to go with your friends for a weeknite dinner, a special occasion one-on-one or for business meetings with clients.  5 stars all the way.",

They have great specials and reasonable prices. I love sitting in the big, glassy sunny patio area. It feels like being outside but it's climate-controlled!  I've had a few things on the menu: the breakfast skillet, tandoori chicken pizza, wings and the salmon plate. Everything has been absolutely perfect and delicious. Id like to go back to see if the dinner menu and experience is as great as lunch. if it is, I'll happily kick my review up to 5 stars.   Also, I was there on their anniversary day and it wasn't crazy busy or overwhelmingly loud...big plus! They had music playing but it wasnt the kind you had to scream over to talk to your friend three feet away, something i feel I see too much of.",

    "text": "Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.)   Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too.   Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.    ...And i lived happily ever after.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to check this spot out, but it took me forever to get there. Finally my sis and her husband wanted some food, so off to The Vig Uptown we went.  Prior to heading over there, I checked my trusty Yelp, and liked what I saw. I read that it was in some random former bank, but it was not until we arrived at The Vig, did I realize that it was the bank my Dad used to take me as a kid. Waves of positive nostalgia washed over me, this place used to send balloons to kids in cars at the drive thru, and they had a huge Kachina doll there. Weird how memories take you back.  Anyway, arriving Sunday night at around 7, the sign informed us to seat ourselves, and we found a great booth near the bar. I was curious to see how they would notice new people arrived, and out of no where, a friendly server showed up. Drinks were ordered, and we took in the venue. As others have described, The Vig Uptown, is remarkably cozy, warm, and urban.I have to confess I love when reuse happens to old buildings. Rather than bulldoze a bank, turn it into a restaurant. Well done, Vig.  Drinks arrived, and they were super tasty. My sis doesn't drink (don't judge, every family has a black sheep) but our great server, Michelle, recommended a great drink that didn't contain booze, which my sis loved.  The food was amazing, and we even ordered dessert, which was unreal. A brownie sundae sounds simple, and it is, but the execution was outstanding. It was sooo tasty, I highly recommend it.  My only recommendation would be that they provide a non-valet parking option. I don't know of other places where there isn't an option to park elsewhere, or on your own. Maybe if I had an impressive car, I would be all about it, but I drive an Xterra, which isn't exactly flush, although I pretend it is a Cayanne.  A boy can dream.  Overall, this place is really, really well done. The service, food, and venue are just so well executed, I truly can't wait for the next chance to go there.",

They have random specials everyday (Tuesday night- bottle of wine and an appetizer for $20!).  The AMber scrambler (minus the tortilla, extra spicy) is to die for- move over, Postino brunch.  I've had the hummus as well as some random other items but mostly I'm just in love with the tofu scrambler.  DELICIOUS.  Service is always impeccable.  From the hostess, to the water girl- it is pretty consistent.  I may (or may not) have a minor crush on the sweet girl who refills water.  She is cute and efficient.    Why I'm giving them a 4-star, rather than a 5-star:   -The Sunday Squeeze is too pulpy. -My dining mates have complained about the dryness and unspectacularness of the Hangover Helper dish more than once. -Mandatory valet for an attached lot.  You can find me here, often.",

    "text": "Go to the Vig Uptown for the bathrooms alone. Seriously. If you are one of those neurotic people out there like myself who judges establishments and the frequency of which you will attend them by the cleanliness among other features of their bathrooms, then I am thrilled to say you will not be disappointed. The stalls are gigantic, completely separated from top to bottom so you have full privacy and don't have to stare at people's disgusting dirty feet, and best of all, they have a little ledge for your cocktails! Why more places don't consider that sometimes we like to take our drinks to the bathroom with us is beyond me, but it creates a real predicament once you walk into a stall and there's nowhere to put it. Oh, and if I ever become rich I am ripping all of the sinks out of the bathrooms in my condo and replacing them with whoever's sinks are in the Vig. In a word, GORGEOUS!  The second thing that makes the new Vig a winner is the Kid's Menu portion of Mac n Cheese. It is so freaking delicious I have no words. Almost tastes like fresh pasta smothered in Velveeta. Plus it costs like $5, possibly $6, whatever, I've never once been able to finish it.  Drinks are a little pricey for me to spend as much time as I'd like here, especially with regard to their gorgeous bathrooms, but still affordable enough that I'll come party here once or twice a month.  Go check it out for yourself, just watch out for their Sunday Brunch if you're not into babies...because they're everywhere!",

Also, for all of you who can't eat gluten,  they have a flatbread pizza that is to die for and is gluten free. Also, the pizza was only $5.00 on happy hour.   I was so excited as I never get to have a flatbread pizza for a happy hour.  It was so good, that I ate the entire pizza--10 inch pizza and my friend was amazed I could eat everything.  The service is never disappointing.  Our server was Natalie and she was just like the other servers--the best.  I would recommend this restaurant any time, for the food, service, and the decor.

However, we (my wife and I) went there for Happy Hour on Friday and it was a less than stellar experience. The ambiance was great with fun and energetic customers all around. We sat at the outside bar and our bartender was very friendly. Plus we were able to get on their wifi pretty easily.  Where they lose two stars is with the HH specials and the food on HH. The weekly flatbread came out cold and not very appealing. We asked to have it heated up..that was a mistake as they simply microwaved it and brought it back with the cheese melted all over the plate. The artichoke dip was another disappointment. Generally, it's one of my favorite things to order but this time it was difficult to find any artichokes in it at all.   I'm probably going to give this place one more shot but that will be it.  Too many good places in the area to not have a good experience.",

Ambiance was cool, and thankfully the AC was too.  I had the potato pancake.  Don't laugh.  It was scrumptious!  My comrades each had a burger of some sort.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, but those burgers looked delicious!  Sunday was a Funday to go, as their bottles of wine are half price.  What a deal.  They had a mellow band playing during the afternoon, which made the whole day feel very relaxed.  Or was it the wine?  Anyway, the day was finished off with a giant piece of bread pudding that really was just as good as my Mom used to make.  Delish all around.  Please, learn from my mistake.

They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor.   The drinks, while pricey, are really good. I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before.   Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant.   When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time.   Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.  Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...  We do really want to return. Maybe for happy hour or brunch. I want to try their bloody marys and the Amber Scramble. We might even take our kid. But don't worry- he will be well supervised! :)",

    "text": "Went and visited the new Vig last night. As a huge fan of the original Vig in Arcadia area I was excited one opened closer to where I live.  Pros-  Food was very good.  Had the VIGAZZBurger with the fired egg was a lot of food which the average person won't finish and tasted great.  My date also had a burger and thought it was great as well.  The onion rings were excellent and I suggest over the fries. We had the crab artichoke dip to start had to send first one back as it was cold but they fixed  it quickly and the second one was fine.  Note I am not faulting them on this I realize they just opened and takes time to get things right.  A pro on a con is that they offer free Valet  Cons-  The parking is a nightmare  The atmosphere of the design is cold and uninviting.  I like industrial buildings but the decor needs to be warm and inviting.  Example the new postino's down the street   The \"Patio\"- What a joke!!!  The \"patio\" is a mess.  The city must have made them enclose it.  No way they drew this patio up to be what it is.  It's not a patio at all it's fully enclosed with  windows that open around the upper half of the walls.  The lower half is concrete block and the ceiling is high and unfinished.  It's wasn't that busy when I went at the patio sounded like a cafeteria.  The bocce court is signature Vig I just wish the 10 yr old boys running weren't around and throwing the balls all over as with the design of this so called \"patio\" made it even louder.       I think anyone who is a fan of the original Vig like me would agree that they missed the mark on this location.  At the original Vig being on the patio on a nice day with a bottle of wine  is a great way to spend an afternoon.  Either they were forced or by choice got away from what makes The Vig well The Vig.     So food I would give 4 stars the building and atmosphere 1 star.  I will be back if I am in the area to grab a  good burger. I won't be going out of my way  to visit like  I do at the original Vig.",

    "text": "Tonight I attended the Yelp mixer organized by Andrew- the rsvp showed 10 people but being the social Yelpers that we are, over 20 people ended up showing up to check out the Vig Uptown. My friends and I ordered the crab/artichoke dip, hummus dip, guacamole and salsa, and their chicken flat bread from their happy hour menu.  The food was excellent, everything morsel delicious. The manager came over several times to see if everything was fine which was great.  What fell short was the service provided by the waiter. He appeared to be completely overwhelmed by a party of twenty, showing up at various times.   I was there at 5pm and left around 6:30pm, in that span of time I had one drink.  I saw a drink floating by that looked interesting and managed to flag down the waiter.  He told me the Vig did not serve a drink that I was describing which I saw less than 10 mins prior to speaking to him . . . okay- but he did not ask me if I wanted another drink instead.  In the 1 1/2 hours that I was there, pretty much everyone had one order of drink even though quite a few of my fellow Yelpers were saying they would like another of their scrumpious alcoholic beverage.  I was there to eat and to drink- I probably would have had 3 drinks, for sure 2 if the waiter had been more on his toes. So no more than 2 stars for lack of service . . .",

    "text": "I've made several visits to the Vig, and have been very happy each time. The first was one of the first HOT days in May.  I was job hunting, and decided a happy hour cocktail and bite was in order.  Three words\"  TAKE BETHANY HOME!  It's the first on the list of \"vignature\" cocktails...and one of my new favorite drinks.  Julia was behind the bar, and had enough time to exchange a dirty joke with me to make me feel like a regular.  Two drinks and the happy hour sliders...YUM!  My only complaint...and this is the kind of complaint I am sure the owners love...there was too much food!  I am a big girl, and I can put away the chow...but two drinks and an appetizer and I was uncomfortably full!  Didn't even finish the fries - which were great, but I was too full! Second time was happy hour with a girlfriend.  We sat on the patio, shared a couple cocktails (I am stuck on Take Bethany Home, she tried the Moscow Mule...which was also great.)  We split the artichoke dip and the flatbread pizza.  Both were great...but once again - same issue.  Two women who are not afraid to eat - two cocktails and two appetizers...and there were leftovers! Another solo happy hour - I think I have it mastered...the wings are the right amount for one person and two drinks! Was in last night for the ribeye dinner special with my mom and her husband.  (YAY for industry and facebook fan discounts...I fit both categories!)  Mom and I had Take Bethany Home, her hubby had a couple Juan Gambinos.  For a man who only drinks scotch and water, I was impressed he left his comfort zone...and as he ordered a second, it must have been damn good!  All three of us had the special.  The ribeye was well cooked and flavorful, the corn on the cob was a bit plain, but that's A-OK with me.  The potato salad was super fresh, very cold and quite tasty.  Then there were the baked beans.  WOW!  I could make a meal of these alone!  (Gonna ask for the recipe, for sure!)  Mom ordered the brownie a la mode for dessert for the three of us to share.  Personally, I was so full, i would have gladly skipped - but good thing I didn't!  The ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauces were good - but the brownie itself was perfect!  I complain about the portion sizes only because it limits what I can try on one visit.  If there for happy hour, one app per person makes sense - more than that is too much food.  If for dinner, and all members of the party are getting entrees, best to skip apps completely.  Really - one dessert should not have put three people over the edge of too full!  Service has always been prompt and professional and I will be back again and again as long as they keep up this level of service and quality! (Even more often if they want to hire me as a bartender!!) :)  Oh - and the fact they use the picture I took of Take Bethany Home when advertising it on facebook makes me feel VERY loved! :)",

Solid Persian Chicken kabob, with an unmentioned shirin polo accompaniment (they just call the accompaniment by the contents instead, probably for the sake of simplicity).  Kudos for offering good wine at a bargain price, also.  We had a bottle of their Spanish garnacha for only $21.  It went very well with my dish, and someone in my group who had the pork chop (which included a cherry/dijon reduction) loved that pairing, also.",

    "text": "OI. I reallllly wanted to like this place.   After my last review, one of the owners reached out and emailed me, apologized and asked me to give them another shot. Love how much they care about their customers.  The remodel they have done is AMAZING! I loved the enclosed patio area, so cool, literally, I thought the temp would be horrible back there but it was so nice.   First off, the hostess. Sweetest girl ever! She told us it looked like a 20-25 minutes wait and that we could find a spot on the patio and enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. We lucked out and found a spot, this place was SLAMMING for a Tuesday! A nice waitress in a skirt that ALMOST showed some butt cheek came over and took our order. We were hungry so we ordered some guacamole to tide us over for our \"twenty five minute wait\". 30 minutes go by and we think that the waitress has totally forgotten about our order. I go up to the hostess to see how much longer we have to go \"you are next\" she says, Rad! 5 minutes later out comes our gauc, finally. The gauc was decent, we all loved the chips, they were like crack. Another TWENTY minutes goes by, so now we have waited double over what our estimated time of wait was. I really wish she would have been honest with us and just said its going to be a 45 Min- Hour wait. It was CLEAR when she gave us the 20-25 minute wait she was either fudging to keep us there, or had no clue on how to quote a wait for a table. But seriously, sweetest girl ever.   FINALLY we get shown to our table. We are EXCITED. We have been dying to try this place out. Like I mentioned in my first review, the MIL lives in the neighborhood behind the Vig, so we are fans of places we can walk to! The waitress actually cracked a joke about how we probably all know what we wanted to eat since we had waited so long.   The food came out relatively fast....the fries were all warm, but all the sandwiches were luke warm at best. Im pretty sure mine and the hubs were meant to be hot. Our cheese was melty but everything else was room temp/luke warm.   Lets start with mine first, the honey ham & provolone. I took one bite and was astonished by its lack of flavor. It should have been bursting with flavor, it had ham, provolone cheese, grilled pineapple, dijon mayo and a pablono chile! It was flavorless. The only thing that had flavor was the chile that brought mad heat. I tried a few bites with out the chile to get the flavor of the sandwich, zero. I cut off a piece for the hubs and MIL to try to see if it wasn't just me. Nothing. It was a luke warm pile of meat and cheese that tasted like nothing. At least I had some sweet potato fries to munch.   Next up the hubs, He got the uptown steak sandwich, Asked for it medium. It had sliced bistro tenderloin with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, roasted red peppers, Swiss cheese and horseradish mayo on a sub roll. First off, they cut the sandwich in half for you which is awesome, but had the chef been paying attention he would have seen the middle ends of the sandwich were verging on RAW (like red)!! So gross. The hubs picked all the raw looking pieces out, took a bite, NO FLAVOR! A sandwich that has roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and horsey mayo should for sure have flavor!?! This was not the case, he cut a piece off for each of us to try. We all looked at each other in disbelief, how could there be no flavor. Really people, this is not an over exaggerated story, I wish it were. He also got onion rings. Now in my family, onion rings get devoured, in fact fights usually occur as to who gets the last ring. We each take an onion ring, now have you ever eaten those fried batter pieces at the bottom of the Long John Silvers fish baskets? Those little clumps of fried batter that have zero taste? Well, that was what these onion rings tasted like, a bunch of fried nothing.   Lastly the MIL's Turkey sandwich. It had turkey breast with dill havarti, cranberry chutney, roasted tomatoes, cole slaw and honey-mustard mayo on pretzel bread. We all swooned at the pretzel bun! This one wasn't as tasteless as mine and the husbands sandwiches. It was ok. She also ordered the regular french fries. Those were good.   I know this review is getting long and winded, but I want to give an honest full run down of why I gave only 2 stars.   Our waitress only came back once to check on us and was never to be seen until the check came. A different waiter came by and asked if we wanted boxes as each of our plates looked completely untouched. We all said no (in unison).   It for sure has a nice happy hour atmosphere and prices. That has got to be a reason why this place was packed both times we have gone (530-6ish). I've never been to the 1st location to compare the two food and service wise. It has tons of potential, and it looks like plenty of people love The Vig, maybe we went on an off night? I'm sorry Vig, you are just not for me.",

I get the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken every time, it's that good.  My husband has ordered something different each time and has liked them all.  Just a word of warning, concrete floors.  So when the place is full it's very loud.  Not a good place for friends to catch up as you have to practically yell at each other.  But when you're eating food this good, who's going to do much talking anyway?",

The second time was on a dinner date- last Saturday.   WAY too loud- full of guys yelling at football games on the TVs  & their girlfriends trying to act interested.   Not just in the bar area, either- at random tables through the dining area.   Greek salad recommended by the waiter was \"meh\" at best.

Everyone who ordered food at our table enjoyed their meal. They also have a selection of specialty drinks that are good, but on the expensive side. Overall, I enjoyed the general feel of this place, however on a busy Saturday night it was too bad no one could enjoy the patio area and had to stay in the crowded bar.",

Vig is a little bit of a scene in general, but it's worth it for the food and atmosphere. Unfortunately they don't have live music at dinner but they do have a stellar happy hour. The 16th street tacos are really really good, one of my favorites paired with an albarino. I always order the trifecta to share because mini burgers are simply awesome. Food is great, service is even better and the wine is perfect. Id recommend this place for brunch, happy hour or dinner. Check out their location in arcadia on Sundays.",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday night for a last minute meet up with some friends.  First, free valet there is awesome. So thankful that I don't have to drive around looking for somewhere to park.  We ate earlier so just ordered some drinks at first. Our friends, however, had a lovely spread before them. BBQ wings, hummus, and some sandwhich (not sure which). They had never been to the Vig but were quite happy with the food and ate almost everything. They loved the baba ganoush so much that they asked for more along with more pita bread. The waitress want nice enough to bring another helping.  Our friend wanted to try another wine, she asked the waitress to suggest something a little dryer. I was impressed because the waitress was able to suggest an alternative that my friended ended up loving. She was well versed in their wine which was fantastic! As our first group of friends left and we got a text from a group of girl friends that were just arriving so we decided to stay. They all ordered a Take Bethany Home and let me try. It was pretty delish and definitely unique! It is a blend of cucumber vodka, watermelon puree, fresh lemon, and agave nectar. Who knew cucumber vodka would be good. My Irish husband was over the moon because Jamison was on special whe month of March because of St. Patty's day so he got a shot of the 12 year to sip on and by this time we were hungry so we ordered the bbq wings we had seen our friends eating. They were fantastic, great flavor and a little spicy. I didn't even put ranch on them! Very good As far as the night atmosphere at this location it was very low key. I was surprised because the other vig gets very crowed. The Uptown location was full of patrons but not so full that you couldn't walk around of find a seat. We even managed to get the bocce ball court for a bit. I am going to go to for brunch one day for sure!",

The \"patio\" is perfect for getting together with friends after work and enjoying some yummy appetizers and good drinks.  I have had several different meals here but my favorite is the charbroiled flank steak with fingerling potatoes and broccolini.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the sides were a perfect addition.",

The flavor like I said was great so it didn't deter much from that but next time I'll mention it so it can be fresher.",

I ordered some guacamole at after a UYE here and it was flavorless. The salsa that came with it was even worse it tasted like tomato paste. I came back the next week and I ordered the double down. The pita bread was good but the hummus and babbaganoush were just okay. If  The Vig Uptown didn't have amazing Vignature drinks with fresh squeezed juice I would probably would start going back to The Vig on 40th st.",

I really did love this place though.  The re-use of the old bank is absolutely spectacular.  I can't say one bad thing about the design.  I especially love the greenery up by the front entrance.  The vertical display is awesome and I love the u-shaped garden as well.    On to the food.  It really is wonderful!  Plus, they have a killer happy hour so you can sample more things than you would at another time.  We decided to get some crab and artichoke dip as a starter.  It was phenomenal!  It was smooth and creamy, full of flavor, and packed full of yummy crab meat.  The most amazing part?  It only cost like 5 bucks on HH.  Impressive.  I noticed that the menu has a definite Indian/Asian feel to it, so it wasn't entirely my thing, but there were a lot of yummy choices available.  I went with the Turkey Sandwich.  It was packed full of turkey, with cole slaw, dill havarti, cranberry chutney, and honey mustard mayo all between pretzel bread.  It was HEAVENLY!  I loved it so much I saved half and ate the rest the next day for lunch.  The bread was delicious, the cranberry was perfect, and the dill havarti was an awesome twist.  I don't have a single complaint about that sandwich.  I actually can't wait to go back and sample more of their creative food.  I'm still trying to decide if I am more excited for the food or the Bocce though. :o)",

    "text": "I very much wish I could give the gorgeously remodeled Vig more than 3 stars, but the inconsistency in food and service has knocked off a star for the time being.    Aesthetically, the Uptown Vig is just lovely.  The renovation of the space was done with class, and the differing textures on every wall/surface/decor really made things pop.  I'm loving the re-purposing trend in central Phoenix... what great use of an old, seemingly useless space.   On my first visit to the Uptown Vig, I came with the girlfriends for Happy Hour.  We love to check out all of the greatest happy hours around town, and were particularly excited for half-priced appetizers.  We had the traditional hot \"vings\", guac and chips, trifecta (mini-burgers) and the flatbread pizza with tandori chicken.  All of the items were relatively good, however nothing really stood out or surprised us.  We were disappointed at our server's attitude.  She seemed immediately put off when we ordered only waters and 2 cokes (table of 4) with our food.  Come on - \"real\" drinks aren't required, are they?  It was a school night!  Plus, I had to manage to drive myself home, and I totally can't manage that with even one drink.  I understand that we were reaping the benefits of the happy-hour pricing without shelling out for alcohol, but there is no need to be put off by our choice.  We ALWAYS tip enough to make up for their trouble... Anyways... I digress...  I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband, after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at home, I discovered that they had stuck a great, big piece of naan on top of the curry.  Gluten, gluten everywhere :(  Our second visit was a great turnaround.  We had decided to go to Chelsea's Kitchen for Mother's Day Brunch.  Chelsea's turned out to be so packed that we couldn't even find a space to park.  Using our incredible genius, we decided that the fairly new Vig would probably have less of a crowd.  Boy, were we right!  We were seated right away, and there were many tables to spare.  I ordered the Achiote Salmon - oh my.  It was an incredible dish.  Such complexity of flavor in the spices and poblano sauce, and the accompanying chorizo-stuffed corn cake was delish.  Definitely something to return for.  The husband ordered chilequiles, and thought they were good, but not nearly as great as Gallo Blanco's version.  Both of our mothers ordered the Persian Kebabs, and both seemed pleased, but not completely bowled over.   The child ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which was entirely too much bread and not quite enough cheese.  I did enjoy stealing his French fries, however - yum!  Since the new Vig is just around the corner from my house, has a super happy hour, and the amazing salmon dish, I'm sure I will be back.  Hopefully the service loses the slightly I'm-better-than-you attitude, and adopts a truly friendly vibe.  Looking forward to that!",

At a glance, the menu is american but seems to be inspired by mediterranean, middle eastern, indian, caribbean and latin american flavors.   I love the wings, burgers, steak salad, chicken sandwich.  Cons: they put way too much cheese on everything, the salsa and guacamole is below average.  And the thing I love most about this place is the design.  They took a mid-century modern bank and turned into an ultra sleek modern tavern.",

The first time I had some ribs, and I had to question what animal the ribs were from! A hamster maybe? It was disturbing. Glad I didn't see them on the menu this time around, The food is overpriced, and average. The chicken kabobs were dry, and when the waitress asked how everything was, I told her, and she agreed. She said she didn't like them either! Nice. My friend ordered her burger medium, and it came out well done. Very well done. I was brought the wrong beer, but said I would drink it anyway. I don't like to waste beer. When the waitress brought me the correct beer, she said I wouldn't be charged for the first one. I was.   I really don't get all the good reviews. Most of the people I saw weren't even eating.... because they were to busy posing, trying to get the attention of all the other posers! I thought I was in Scottsdale for a minute. Ugh.",

Each time I visit, I discover a new feature I love about the interior here, right now its the sculptural wall behind the bar. But honestly I have never been impressed by the food, once, and I always want to be...until Tuesday night. First off, had a fantastic waiter, Stuart (a transplant from AZ88) loved him, great service, couldn't have been better. Right there, just for fab decor and an equally fab waiter is 3 stars with me, but tonight the food killed it! Had the Pad Thai and it was incredible!

    "text": "I live downtown and work for a locally owned restaurant as well.  I spend a lot of time at the restaurants around the downtown and uptown area, mostly because service is a lot more friendly and personal.   However my last experience here was a very disappointing one.   I had called ahead and asked about a reservation for my anniversary which was responded to that they didn't take any reservations for parties smaller than 8. It was a bit disappointing seeing how I wanted to make this night a bit special for the 2 of us, but obviously this company is a little more interested in making their dollar than our experience.   I, however didn't make a fuss even after the hostess told me that the wait, if there was one, wouldn't be longer than 15 minutes (how reassuring).  Upon arrival (30 minutes earlier than I had wanted to set the reservation for) we spotted 2 open seats at the bar (the same 2 seats as our first date at that location exactly 2 years ago).  Excited by the small coincidence we sat ourselves at the now full bar.  It is only a 15 seat bar,  a bit small but not too big for one bartender to handle.  We sat in between a pair of ladies sipping on martinis and a couple.  We sat for a few minutes and watched the bartender walk by, again and again.  Finally he stopped sort of in front of us and asked the ladies next to us if they wanted another round ( at this time we still had not been greeted by anyone and had no menus in front of us).  After the ladies next to us responded yes, he walked by us AGAIN and continued to make the martinis for them.  Well at that point, the exciting coincidence of sitting in the same seats as our first date 2 years ago was ruined, so we decided to move to a table and hope for a server that wanted our money.  The experience at the table was rushed and lacked any sort of personality.   After only a few bites of our appetizer our entrees came out.  All in all I probably won't be returning.   There are too many great restaurants in the area with better staff who seem to enjoy their job more.",

    "text": "I went to the Vig Uptown twice in the past week. The first time was on a Thursday night around 9:30pm. I went with a friend and she ordered the watermelon martini and I ordered a beer. And then we waited...and waited...it was about 15 minutes later when our server finally came back with the drinks. She apologized for taking so long, blamed the bartender, and told us our drinks would be on the house. Free drinks was cool but the place was not busy so I'm unclear as to what really happened. We ordered food, she got the sliders and I had the black bean burger. I asked for mine with no cheese and no aioli but with siracha hummus on the side instead (I'm a vegan). It came out with no cheese or aioli but without the hummus so it was too dry to eat until I could get her attention again, about 5 minutes later to get it for me. Overall, I was not impressed. The food was ok but nothing special.. I should mention it was not busy and no manager ever came to our table. The second time this week I went to The Vig Uptown was last Sunday, four days later. I was meeting a friend who wasn't able to meet up until 8:30pm so I had picked The Vig because their website stated they were open until midnight on Sunday nights. I didn't want to pick a place that was only open until 10pm and then get kicked out. I called a few days ahead when I was choosing a place and asked if they had any specials on Sundays like all day happy hour or half off bottles of wine and I was told no, they had no specials. I picked it anyways because I knew the food was decent and the hours fit our needs. As soon as I got there, I noticed that on every single menu at the bottom it says that Sundays is half off bottles of wine. I can't believe that anyone answering the phone would not know this information. The server assured me it was still the Sunday special, I ordered a bottle, and we got some hummus and fries to snack on. Service was good until at 10:42pm our server came by to tell us that it was last call. I told her I was confused because the website stated they were open until midnight and she only said they were not. No manager came over again. We left and felt screwed out of time together because we picked this place thinking we would have another hour of catching up time. After two mediocre at best visits, I will not be back.",

The food is consistently good.  I'm a big fan of their deconstructed fish taco salad and the vigan sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, delicious!   It's definitely not as big as its counterpart - it has bocce ball but is missing the awesome patio - but it's also not as crowded, which is nice. I've been to both locations several times and this one seems to be more low key, even family friendly, than the original Vig which always seems to be verging on the edge of Scottsdale douchebaggery.    Their new menu is really amusing, too, give it a close read sometime.",

I think of it like this: it is FREE of gluten. There. And it tastes awesome at The Vig.  I'm like the next guy when it comes to gluten. I'm all in when it comes to other obscure food things like lutein and lycopene but sometimes you just get the itch to eat something without gluten that tastes like something with gluten. And that's where The Vig shines. You can get a hamburger without gluten in the bun and you can get a gluten-free (see note above) black bean burger as well. Both excellent. Sweet potato fries are the best you've ever had. No kidding. Drinks can be ordered gluten-free but it really isn't necessary unless you're getting some kind of doughy drink or something. Pisco Sour doesn't have any dough or gluten...but I digress.  The crowd is cool, the service is spot-on and you will love it here. Order off the menu if you're on a date. You'll look impressive, \"Let's see...can you ask the chef to make me a gluten-free horseradish tilalpia fish, hold the horseradish AND the gluten.\"  Moscow Mule will kick you like an angry mule from Russia and you'll be saying 'nada mas!' to the San Jacinto Blood Orange/Vodka Sour.

Only thing that sucks is the parking lot should be bigger. I really liked the whole set up and I sat inside but I got a good look at the outside area and it was really nice as well. Next time I go I'll probably eat and drink out there with a few friends",

Anyone can come here and feel comfortable.  We went for burger night (Monday night people!), not knowing what to expect... Here's what to expect: a giant effing specialty burger (3 to choose from), cooked to perfection, served with a hearty portion of fries or sweet potato fries! FOR 5 BUCKS!  Our waiter was either stoned or really new at his job... I'll give him the benefit of the doubt even though he talked like Jeff Spicolli, and say that he was probably just new. But hey, I'm not gonna bitch on $5 burger night...",

I loved the vibe of this place and the Arizona room was pretty cool. The area next to the fireplace looks like a great place to hang out and have drinks.   The portions here pretty big, but I ordered the horseradish crusted tilapia and the serving was just right. It came with a quarter of a stuffed mushroom, which was different, but good. The roasted red pepper sauce that accompanied the fish was a great compliment. And the potatoes were yummy too. Everyone else had sandwiches, which were huge and enough for lunch the next day. The crabmeat and artichoke dip was also tasty.   I loved the atmosphere of this place much more than the Arcadia location and although this place is a little further form home and you have to valet, this is the one I will return to. I actually came back the day after my first visit just to have dessert in the Arizona room and so Mike could check it out. He liked it better too!",

Not to mention last time I was there my car was damaged by the valet service they want you to use. (Little known fact you can refuse their valet service and they cannot require you to use it) I left a few messages for Vig management after I tried to work it out with desert valet owner and never was called back. Given all that nonsense I sort of boycotted the Vig...but then I was hungry and at the bar across the street and we will slim on options. We sat at the bar on a Sunday evening and the bartender was very new to the Vig. She by far was the best server I've had there since they liquidated the OG crew. She was personable and attentive. Had she not told us I never would of guessed she was so new. The food was much better then previous visits. It's still not as good as it used to be but I think they are getting better. I won't punish the Vig for my experience with their valet company and owner. I'm glad to see they are improving their staff and food.",

Here's the thing, they did not charge us anything for the space! We only had to meet a minimum for food & drink. We had been shopping around for cool venues in Phoenix for months & this was by far the cheapest option with the most space! They allowed us to bring in a DJ, customize a menu, & they had everything setup up for us. If the money saving aspect & being at a great spot wasn't enough, the cherry on top was definitely the staff! Cesar, the Events Director, was a breeze to work with. He's charming, helpful & puts you at ease while you're trying to plan such a huge event. He took time to respond to all of my emails & calls, & to meet with us in person to finalize details. I don't know how much he makes, but he deserves a raise! The night of our event we had 2 servers assigned to us, Chris & Lacey (not sure if spelled right), they were both friendly, hard working & fun! They made sure we had everything we needed, that the food never ran low & the glasses were never empty! It made the night so much more enjoyable working with such dedicated people! Thank you, Vig Uptown, for helping create a night we will never forget!",

Also on this day they were serving half off their bottles of wine! How does that not make you like the place even more already! They have a pretty decent wine selection (mostly the basics) and a nice food selection. You can get anything from nachos to ramen noodles! I have never had ramen noodles at a restaurant before, so I am thinking I will have to try that the next time I come here. We came more for drinks and hanging out then we did the food, so I split the nachos and street tacos with a friend. The meat had a great taste to it, the guacamole was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy! We were here for quite a long time and our waitress was very helpful with drink selections and answering questions, we were even able to sample a few different wines. It was nice that she kept checking back with us to make sure we were doing well, even after we finished our meals.  Great new trendy place to stop in and check out. I am interested in going back and trying more of the food!",

It was the Vig's one year anniversary the other night, so my friends and I decided to have dinner here. The restaurant  has a minimalist , trendy and modern atmosphere.  We enjoyed several half off appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts!  (See pictures)  We did order a lot for three people and had plenty of left overs.  They were half off, so how could anyone resist?  I was also able to pick up wifi here and that automatically gets a boost in rating from me.

    "text": "Dateline: \"Uptown\" Phoenix. Saturday 3:17pm. After just having hung out at Turf Paradise working on my tan by hanging out in the grandstand, I decided to take my $7.60 in winnings and treat myself to a late lunch at The Vig Uptown. I had been to the one in Scottsdale but not this location and I thought it was worth a repeat visit. The reason was their pozole. I remembered it being flavorful and well... GREAT! So that was what I was going to have. I know that for some reason pozole has become quite trendy. Heck, I believe El Pollo Loco was even offering it as a special side! But it is very good and I was \"flush from the track\" so pozole was what I was going to have. I arrived at The Vig Uptown and ventured inside. It is very similar (identical?) to the one in Scottsdale. A little dark but has a very nice open air seating area and has a \"trendy\" yet comfortable vibe to it. I was greeted by the bartender who, at first was a bit \"too cool for school\". He gave me a water and a menu and then proceeded to chat up the women on either side of me at the bar. Two young ladies placed an order for something they were out of and Mr. B-tender seemed to give them a bit of a hard time when then had trouble deciding what to get instead. They finally landed on an Old Fashioned. B-tender then walked away grabbing bottles and returned a few mins later asking the women what was in an Old Fashioned! Everyone grabbed their phones and hit up Google for the answer. Shortly after that weird moment, Mr B returned to take my order. Well, I did get my pozole, but as a side to their Chorizo Burger that sounded just too good not to try. Mr. B recommended the mac and cheese as a side when I ordered the burger, but gave me a \"touche \" when I requested the pozole. Apparently he approved. He then went about his duties only to check back with me about 5 mins later to ask me again what I had ordered!!! So I gave it to him again and waited. I had a couple of Blue Moons while waiting. Burger finally arrives and the first thing I notice is that the way I am used to having the pozole served...with the onions, radish, cabbage, etc on the side, is not how it was served here. Everything was already mixed in. Part of the fun of this soup is being able to determine what, and how much, you add to it. It was still flavorful, just different. Different is how I would also describe my Chorizo Burger. It had a weird texture. Not really a burger, not really sausage. The arugula on the burger overpowered it and so it tasted a bit like lawn clippings with a nice mayo sauce. After all was said and done, I was a little disappointed by my visit to The Vig Uptown. Not at all bad, but there are better places out there.  - Knife  (Written by Knife of Knife N Fork. Please check out the reviews by my critic in crime, Fork, of Fork N Knife.)",

We were sat outside at a pollen covered table that didn't look wiped down and without menus or silverware to start. I thought the dip was great for an appetizer but my fried chicken sandwich was a bit disappointing. It was smashed down very thin and seemed over cooked and lacked an juice or distinguished flavor. I did like how you could do half and half on the side of fries which both were good.",

    "text": "Met up with some girlfriends there last night. Sat on their patio. Comfortable atmosphere, comfortable seating. We had dinner and everyone seemed pleased with their dinner. While I am a meat eater, for some reason the Black Bean Burger caught my attention - it was pretty good. The flavor was really good but it was a little dry, which sometimes happens, I would have loved some sort of spicey mustard or maybe honey mustard to have accompanied it. As an adult, I've suddenly got a taste for brussell sprouts (my mom would be so proud) so gave theirs a try, I wasn't impressed (but I'm not a big brussell person, so probably not their fault). Their fries were good and they had quite a few side options, including traditional fries, sweet potatoe fries, mac & cheese, and I think there was something else beside the brussel sprouts. When I first pulled in, it looked as thought valet was the only option. But after I got out of the car it looks like I could have driven a bit further on 16th street to have found the self-park.  Definitely a placed I'd take my husband to, or another group of friends!",

I got here at 5 o'clock on Monday for Happy hour. I waited for about 15 minutes for a drink but had good company so it was fine :) we ordered our drinks and asked to wait to order to have a chance to look at the menu. At 5:55 we still hadn't seen our waitress (since 5:15) and wanted to order another happy hour drink before it ended and order dinner but still hadn't seen her. The table next to us mentioned they'd been waiting for 45 minutes and hadn't received any drinks or food or anything yet (but their food came out after). Around 6:20, I stopped another server and asked about just getting our check because we'd been there for around an hour and hadn't had the chance to order dinner. We paid our bill and left. It's just crazy that no one offered to take our order then when I mentioned it. Or offer an appetizer. Or even something as simple as an apology? Or really anything. I don't expect free food but I also don't feel like I should have to flag someone down after an hour just to pay my bill. It was a super disappointing experience. I likely won't be trying it again.",

Maybe it's the turkey that my waiter said was leftover from his turkey Thanksgiving (yes, he said that jokingly). Maybe it is the pretzel bun (I swore I'd never eat another one but this one didn't swell in my stomach making me cry for three days--nope, not this time). What a great combination of flavors!

Typically house wines aren't the best but The Vig has great taste!   I'm not sure what I love more, the cozy vibes or the comfort food! We nestled in to a spacious booth (yes we were that obnoxious couple that sat on the same side) and were excited for a lovely date night! We split the mac and cheese with broccoli and the Pad Thai. Both were just what we needed on a chilly winter evening! The mac is one of my favorites in town - i've been ordering it for years. We even had a decent amount of each for leftovers the next day! The restaurant was PACKED for a Thursday night and we still scored great seat and attentive service.   We live near the Arcadia location but will definitely come back here when in the area!

We requested to sit outside but there was too long of a wait for it. So we opted to sit by the fireplace. This was nice, because it gave us the feeling of being outside with the large windows and foliage. The tables were loungey type tables rather than dinner type tables; the only downside. Stooping over to eat is not my favorite.  We ordered the veggie burger with fries and the Mac and cheese. The burger was good in my opinion. The SO didn't like the red peppers but I think it all worked very well. The fries looked shrimpy and sad, but they were actually very tasty. The Mac and cheese was....okay. It was plain and a bit liquidy. Lacked flavor with the exception of a stronger milky flavor.   I liked this place. It seems like a cool place to hang out with friends. They also had a little bocce ball area that was dominated by a group of kids. I think I'd come back for their burger.",

For brunch, apps and drinks for 6 of us, the bill was around $240 including gratuity since we were in a larger party. I'm from the bay, so $240 would have only fed about half of us in Oakland. And we were like drunk, drunk and full as hell by the time we were hailing our Lyft.  Phoenix is my home away from home and the staff and vibe at the vig uptown just make me feel even more welcome. Everything was so delicious and they were so accommodating it was truly amazing. I'll definitely be back, more than likely to this vig specifically. Cant wait for my next trip",

It's trendy and modern on the inside and the restaurant is comfortable. I think they have live music on the weekends. Be aware they have mandatory valet parking for anyone who wants to park in the lot. It's free but make sure to have cash for a tip. You can park next door if you want to avoid valet.

Other than that it's got a nice atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating although it's a little dark in there. I'd come back again if I'm visiting for sure though!",

I picked it up to go, but I love the vibe of the restaurant. I want to go back and hangout for a bit. The pozole order was huge compared to what I was expecting. All the fixings came on the side. I wish the fixings would've been packed individually only because I hate onion. The fixings were cabbage, red onion, cilantro, radish, avocado, & lime. The pozole was so good! So much flavor, not too spicy and the perfect ratio of hominy to pork. I never thought I would find good pozole, especially one you can order during the weekday! I can't wait to try out their other menu items.",

While I love the \"old\" Vig for it's awesome patio ( usually...not during the summer, of course) and great service, I love the new Vig for its decor, great drink specials, stellar service....and it's a little more geographically desirable.   The Arizona Room did trip me out at first because I assumed sitting up at the bar that it was a patio but it's actually nice being able to feel like you're SORT of outside without really being outside. The wall to leave your mark on is fun! It's an interesting little addition and it's entertaining to see what some people put up.   The guac and chips are good as are the sliders aka The Trifecta...can't go wrong with the shoe string fries. Once again, I'm going to have to head over there on an empty stomach to really test it out one of these days.  I can agree with most on the valet; the guys are really nice but there's tons of other spots to park at if you aren't super lazy and wanna cross the street (or head next door).  All in all, give the Vig a go.",

    "text": "This is a tough review for me... as I am torn.... 3 starts? or 4 stars?   First I have to say I LOVE THE VIG!!! You should too. I am just not a super huge fan of this location.   Reasons:  1. It is further away from my house than the original Vig. *not anyone elses problem other than mine*  2. The patio is less than mediocer.  3. The place is made out of solid concrete, making everything echo and if there are more than 5 people in the building it is too loud to hear yourself even think, let alone talk to the people at your table.  4. I know most of the staff at the 40th street one, and I don't like change.  5. OH and Elvis Before Noon doesn't play here on Sundays.   Again, I LOVE THE VIG! The food is great the service is always good and a good time is usually had by all. But I have to say I am partial to the original. This is not to say you shouldn't go to the Vig Uptown, if you do it will be less crowded at the old one for me ;-)   Tips: Try the Vings, Smoked Salmon Ap, and the Tenderloin Salad (might not be on the menu but they can make it.)   Happy Vig-ing!",

Whew!  The parking seems to still have some kinks to work out, as any signs of a valet stand or staff were MIA when I initially pulled up (7pm on a Sunday).  We figured it out though and no big deal.    The atmosphere here is just awesome, I absolutely love it.  It seems more spacious than the original space, but it was also slow while I was in there so I am hesitant to make a firm judgement until after it passes the Friday-happy-hour-test.  Same great vibe though, perhaps even warmer/sexier atmosphere.  The biggest surprise to me was the faux patio, with large open windows but actually an enclosed space.  For me, one of the fatal flaws of the original Vig patio the limited outdoor seats that also weren't smoking tables, so perhaps this is a good solve?  Overall, will absolutely put this spot in heavy rotation.  Keep the new locations coming, please!!",

    "text": "Okay, downgrading my last review.  One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken \"Vings\" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.  Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips.  Someone else will appreciate it I am sure.  Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won't hurt your profits that bad!!  Peace out.    Find your sizzle!!  Attorney Steve",

Knowing that this used to be a bank, you'd never expect that it would be so beautiful inside.  Food - the chicken kebobs were perfect.  I think the best flavors I've ever had in a kebob meal.  The Pad Thai is something that I was looking to try as well and it appears that the recipe is being fine-tuned to be just as good as the dish I had or better.

Offered half off that item later (which did not actually happen on the bill!)

We got about half way through our meal (which was so, so...) and finally the bocce court opened up so  we took the chance to play a game.

    "text": "This is really nicely designed place, with good (but not especailly awesome) food, and slightly spotty service.  It's tough to get a seat or find a parking space.    I've been here maybe 6 times and there is almost always a wait.    There's barely any parking, which means valet (cool area of town, I get it), but you can't really ask about the wait for a table before deciding whether or not to stay - the valet area is super tiny, so they take your car immediately.  When you go in and discover the wait is 45 mins to an hour, you're already trapped.  There's a cool patio area with incredibly uncomfortable bench-couch-type seating in the back - if you're going to have a wait, it ought to be comfy.  The menu is definitely decent, but not spectacular, in both options and execution.  I feel like the quality/creativity of the food isn't good enough to make up for all the trouble.  The Vigan sandwich, Pad Thai and fish tacos are all tasty, but nothing will knock your socks off.    Additionally, I've had semi-rude service at least twice, and I'm far from picky or demanding.    Overall, it's a perfectly good place to stop into when it's quiet and you're in the neighborhood, but not worth a special trip or an hour wait.",

It's pretty spacious with a covered patio-like area that would be great to sit in on a sunny day. The place only had about 4 customers when I went in...so it was pretty empty and we were prompted to seat ourselves.  Me and my boyfriend ordered the cheese tots, onion rings, fish tacos and the VigAzz Burger with sweet potato fries. The tots,  they were eh...if you ate 2 or more, you would get full quick, as well as the onion rings...very heavy food. The fish tacos were great! Blackened white fish=YUM. Although there were too many onions, my bf enjoyed the VigAzz sandwich, it was huge! All in all, the service was ok and the food was ok. I would definitely give it another try to taste some other menu items.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to give this place just one star due to the poor attitude of the valet.  The valet is the first impression you get when you reach a restaurant and if they aren't professional, it really makes you think twice about walking in to dine at the establishment. I did not realize I wasn't able to self park at ALL when I pulled up to this location.  I saw the valet sign, but did not want to valet and assumed I could self park. After self-parking, we were more or less \"given the business\" from the parking attendant.  I advised him I wanted to self-park and purposely didn't valet as I didn't have any cash to tip and I'm not typically a person that likes to valet my car.  They had plenty of open parking spots as it was lunchtime.  So, he walked away and didn't argue about. Upon getting closer to the entrance, a different valet parking attendant gave me a hard time about \"not stopping and driving right through\".  I advised him it was a mistake and I didn't realize I couldn't self park.   Another woman self parked her car and advised she'd been there since 10 a.m.  She was out getting something from her car and noticed the way the guy was giving me attitude.  She then went in and spoke to the manager about their attitude, especially the 2nd guy.  I walked over as she was talking to the manager and gave her my side of the story as well.  The manager was apologetic and kind about the situation.   After our meal, I went to the restroom and saw the same lady in the bathroom.  She advised that the manager comped her meal and asked if she did the same for me.  I, with shock, told her \"no\".  I never got a comped meal, discount or anything of the kind.  Interesting, since I was the one that was spoken to unprofessionally by the valet as I walked into the restaurant. When I got out to my car, I noticed plenty of open parking spots still, but yet a HUGE construction work truck that they decided to park right next to my car as \"payback\".  I can only assume payback because of there being plenty of other spots open.  Pretty immature and again, speaks to the unprofessional demeanor of the valet attendants.    Food was good, but the valet experience was terrible.  It's unfortunate they have no self-parking (even at a slow weekday lunch) and that the valet had to treat customers the way that they did.",

AZ during my Grand Canyon-Sedona trip in November.  Yes, this place was a very cool design and ambiance. Food was eclectic and very good. And the AZ Cardinals were playing and winning on their tv. That's all I got.  Next time I must remember to post then and there.   Oh, and when in Pittsburgh, you must visit Mad Mex.  See my timely ;) review.",

    "text": "This place has managed to stay on my 5 star list since November 2011 ( when I was first introduced to the Vig compliments of Yelper David L) I have had 2 yelp accounts since that first delicious burger, and many more burgers before I went back to being vegan. I saved all my reviews  & this was my last update ..when I was still a Carnivore. And burger pics from my first visit in 2011.  6/19/2012 I fell in love the ambiance here (back in the fall) it is just a very cool place that happens to be trendy,  and comfy all at the same time. Nice place for a few drinks, or dinner followed by cocktails.   The Monday  5 dollar burger deal paired up with a Stella beer in my opinion just cannot be beat . the Vig burger is gigantic,  and juicy  topped with bacon, gouda,  and red onion. The arcadia burger is a classic cheeseburger with a yummy sauce . Pair these up with crispy sweet potato fries,  and an ice cold Stella,  and it is all good . And,  i really like the service they all have great personalities and that is a plus in my book .  I also dig their Nacho's, and they have 5 dollar drinks on Wednesdays .And a cool reverse HH as well on Thursday   The Vig Rocks ! .  Update April 2013  I loved the tofu scramble which was chock full of onions, peppers, mushrooms wrapped burrito style, it was delicious, and filling. Bloody Mary's hit the spot as well.  Still a 5  it's nice to have Vegan options- but.. I still love this place for drinks!",

    "text": "Bummed over Brunch - won't be back.   To start, I have been a big fan of The Vig since I moved to Phoenix 6 years ago. Taken first dates there, spent a few birthdays, dinner with friends and many terrific brunches. Lately, we have become more choosy about where we spend our time and money, so when we had the craving for mimosas and a good brunch, we debated between a familiar favorite, The Vig, or a recent new interest, St. Francis. We had not been to The Vig in awhile and decided, Uptown it was. We wanted bottomless mimosas, ceviche to start, and then a yummy breakfast dish.   We got there a bit before Noon to find it about half full not too crazy, waited at the door for the hostess to figure out what she was doing (not kidding) and finally sat a party of five ladies before us, then us, then another couple of guys after us, all sitting pretty close in vicinity. Ladies had a server approach first, then the other guys, then us, whatever. We asked for the starters only to learn that it was now illegal to serve bottomless mimosas (boo, oh well) and that they had taken the ceviche off the menu. Whaaat?! BOTH are still on the website menu guys. Fine, we ordered mimosas and chips and guac. Mimosas came and then placed our food order and waited for the appetizer. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for the chips and guac after having to remind our server Lindsey (\"oh, yeah...\") about them and watching the other 2 tables who ordered the same thing get theirs shortly after ordering. Our server returned (and said \"oh, they must have lost the ticket\" with little empathy for their mistake. Thankssssss.  All the while, waiting for our app, we start to look around and take in the environment. I have to say, this was the strangest visit I have ever had to Uptown. We saw they had some sort of Fantasy Football league party of people on the patio, who didn't seem to be taking much of the server's attention. It wasn't a huge group, so it didn't seem to be a reason for the speed of service. Also, we noticed there was no music on, not sure if they turned it off or extremely low for the party, but geez, it was so stale and sleepy in there. It felt like you were dining in a place after-hours when they want you to leave.   After about 3 minutes of eating the chips, our food arrives. UGH. Hate that. This is why we ordered them early, not a new concept here but anyway. Server becomes back 30 seconds later and asks how the entrees are, and we tell her we haven't touched them yet as we were still wanting to enjoy the appetizer. She says, \"Oh, don't stress about the chips and guac, I took it off your bill.\" Yeah, that's nice of you but seriously \"don't stress\"??? Yeah, stressed isn't quite the feeling I am experiencing right now.   He orders the Eggs Benedict (neither of us had tried it before) and I ordered the Steak & Eggs (same deal, first time).   Eggs Benedict - nothing to expand upon. Pretty basic. The Hollandaise is a spicy version and not exactly the star of the dish. Then again, there were no stars, the fact that english muffins, ham and eggs taste good together is the only thing that made the dish enjoyable.   Steak and Eggs - Sent it right back (see photo). Steak was gray. Hash browns were hash-grays. Everything just looked soggy and unappetizing. I ordered the steak medium, which is essentially was, but this flank steak was the worst looking piece of steak I have ever had put in front of me. I cut it up and the texture was all gristle and mush, took one bite and it was my last. No flavor, chewy, gross. The hash browns were one big soggy grey pancake. I am not eating this. Signaled the server and told her and she offered to have it remade - no thanks, i will just take the Eggs Benedict, I am over this brunch.   The reorder takes (of course) longer than the original order and in the meantime, it felt like the waitress is now staying away from our table. All the while, I was never rude or mean in my tone with her and you would think with as many issues as our table had been experiencing, there would have been some added attention to at least save the tip right? Keep the mimosas coming? Nope! Lindsey failed. We had to ask others who came by, one who may have been a manager and I ended up explaining that we had to send the food back, since she noticed I didn't have a plate. She then said that she agreed about the quality of the steak, it's not good, and that their \"hash browns\" are more like a potato pancake. But gray? Ummm, so the issue is known that the $14 Steak and Eggs aren't good and more than just myself have had an issue, yet, still on the menu.  This was the worst experience I have had at the Vig, and upon trying the Fillmore location we have had TWO pretty crappy service experiences (so we don't go anymore). Arcadia has always been the best. As of now, I wouldn't dare try Scottsdale.   I am hoping this isn't a sign of things going downhill because they have too many locations to manage.",

We asked for an obscure single malt scotch and our waitress knew all about the selections.  Decent food. Modern iterations of bar fare. Good fries.  UPDATE: 08/19 I had a GREAT time at The Vig Uptown hosting my son's birthday party. The staff was SO MUCH FUN in helping to embarrass my boy. We ordered the mac n cheese (a hit!), the wings (just ok), big basket of fries (we had to order these twice!), the nachos (awesome!).",

I would get both again though.  The flatbread pizza was the winner for the night at our table.   They could use more IPAs on tap but that is more of a personal preference.  The tower station IPA they have is good but I always like a different IPA to try for my second beer.",

The sweet/spicy glaze and natural size of drums/thighs is why I order them. If you are not a fan of oversized looking wings, you are going to love these wings.  Sweet potato fries are my side for the wings. Crispy and well seasoned.  Rear patio is covered but does have oversized windows that twist open. Patio seating has enough tables to sit couples to large groups.  Sitting at the east side of the restaurant (rear patio) has a private area for bocci ball and bags.",

There was brie, almonds, strawberries, grapes, prosciutto, and more.  Then we had the Classic Burger, \"lettuce, tomato, onion, american cheese, secret sauce, brioche bun\" ($13) and the Crispy Chicken sandwich \"buttermilk fried chicken, american cheese, jalapenos, pickles, and smoked honey mustard on ciabatta\" ($14). They were both okay but nothing spectacular.   We finished off with the Gingerbread Cake, \"pumpkin mousse, pecan crumble, sugared cranberries, molasses caramel\" ($10). Again nothing mind blowing but it was decent.  Everything food wise was missing that punch. I have a feeling most of the grand reviews are about their brunch, not dinner.   However, although the food was nothing incredible the ambiance and service was. As the sun set the light flooded in filtered by the stained glass windows which was lovely, my friend managed to catch it in a photo. During that hour, the place lit up beautifully. Also, there is architecturally a lot of texture throughout which added to the creative atmosphere.",

If you're reading this and the answer is \"I haven't been to The Vig!\" then step away from the computer, enter your vehicle; be it sneakers, sandals, or moon shoes, and get to the Vig. You'll especially want to follow these simple directions if it's the weekend during brunch hours or Mondays for their $5 burgers after 6pm, weekdays between 3-6pm for happy hour, or just about any other time.  The weekend brunch and those Bloody Mary's, the Bloody Mary bar; for me, please hold the bloody and bring only the Mary. For those of us, I know there's more than just me out there, who don't particularly enjoy the tomato juice, this is a build it yourself sort of Bloody Mary bar. For a cool $4 they'll bring you a glass of Titos vodka on ice and send you on your way to the Bloody Mary bar. Top yours with things like bacon, asparagus, meat balls, celery, and a host of other ingredients, it's almost a meal to itself; but for my Bloody Mary, and again, hold the bloody, I'll take just a few of those limes please!  Ahh the chorizo burro, the dish I just can't stop ordering, and just for fun, I deconstruct it by asking for the tortilla on the side. I'd like to tell you that I don't finish that tortilla, every time, though that's always my intention. I'd also like to tell you the sky is green and it's always cold in Phoenix Arizona. I'd like to say a lot of things but they just wouldn't be True, and you, my friends, deserve nothing but the truth. It's always delicious, it's always satisfying, and they've always got cool music playing during Sunday brunch.  So go and get it Phoenix weekend brunchers. If you're still debating on partaking in their delightful weekend meals, I say, why wait?, carpe diem, eat brunch!  Happy yelping!",

I thought it was downtown?! (Yelps it) There's more than one! BRILLIANT!  We went for a weekday lunch in the winter, sat on the beautiful back patio, tables and lounge-type seating, with huge windows letting the sun nourish indoor plants and brighten a bocce ball court.   Each thing we ordered was an ideal version of that thing. Moscow Mule - in a Tito's copper mug with a lime, delicious. A couple of apps - fried calimari with a banging sauce and a grilled lemon, and jalepeno artichoke dip with pita, so gooey and good.   Entrees: corn and avocado salad, crispy and delicious and great ingredient ratio, and killer Korean short rib tacos with fried onions and salsa - FOUR tacos by the way, one up from the typical taco entree amount of three, a great move.  Great meal, cool waiter, comfy space, well-executed comfort food dishes that are just a notch above and one idea better than what you'd normally get. The Vig!",

There's a great option of mimosas so I had the grapefruit mimosa and it was so refreshing I probably chugged them too fast. For brunch I had the avocado toast, which I typically like, but they make it a bit different here. I was expecting the toast to be more like toast or somewhat toasted, but the bread was thick and soft kind of like French toast. The dressing from the bed of arugula topping the bread probably made it soggier than I prefer. It still had a great flavour, I didn't eat the bread but ate everything else like a salad.",

It's enclosed which is nice in the summer to cool off and hang out.   Ambiance is on par for the brand, very cool and chill vibe. I like the decor. It's a place where you can actually enjoy and doesn't make you want to leave as soon as you're done eating.   Drink selection is good, they have some awesome signature cocktails and great beer selection. The menu has a nice variety and has something for everyone.   On this particular visit where were six of us. I love the slider trifecta (that pretzel bun tho) and their tacos (both fish and short rib) but I decided to go with the poke bowl this time. Others at the table ordered the Mac n cheese, Pad Thai and Cobb salad and all enjoyed their dishes.   The poke bowl comes with tuna and lots of veggies/lettuce. I had a more salad vibe than poke bowl but it was delicious. Light and flavorful. I'd recommend if you don't want something so heavy but don't want a basic salad.   Our waitress was super nice and chill. Didn't make us feel rushed but checked in often. Bathrooms were nice and clean. Valet parking available during dinner time, make sure to have some cash to tip. Just another great meal! I highly recommend.",

The parking is tricky if you go during a busy time but there is another lot on the same side 300 ft north and if you are lucky across the street may have open spots.  Valet only during dinner.  We spent 3 hrs there visiting (she was from out of town) and the service was awesome. Our waiter was patient & polite yet attentive to our needs.  Doesn't get any better than that!",

    "text": "I love this place. I've been many times and always have had a great experience. It's closer to work than home so I usually go for more work related reasons and have hosted a number of group events there as well. They do a great job and are very accommodating to your groups needs. If you do an event and use their catering menu order TWICE the number of sliders you think you will need. They are that good. And the corn hole court is a great activity for group events as well. Anyhow, I digress - this review is about our experience on Sat for brunch/lunch.   We were running errands and found ourselves near this Vig location and decided to stop in for a bite to eat. They were offering both a brunch and their regular lunch menu. And $3 mimosas!  WOOT!    I ordered off the brunch menu - chicken enchiladas with over easy eggs. They were amazing. The eggs were cooked perfectly so the yolk ran out into the sauce when you cut into them. And the sauce - a green chili sauce - was to die for. Just the right amount of tang and heat. I asked for the cream and pico on the side and didn't use much of either but I managed to clean my plate otherwise.   Hubby ordered off the lunch menu and got the standard Vig burger with fries. He loves his burgers medium rare and it's not always cooked perfectly but it was. Just the right amount of toppings and cheese  and their fries are amazing - thin and crispy on the outside but soft inside. I must admit I stole a few to soak up the green chili sauce from my enchiladas.   It's a great, solid restaurant with a great, laid back atmosphere. You won't regret stopping in for a bite and a beverage.",

The food is always fabulous, and all Fathers got a free lunch on Father's Day! But the icing on the cake? The DJ. I love trip hop and it's really rare for a DJ these days to spin chill music like that. Not only that, but he had a live trumpet player keeping in time. He even busted out the bass. The fact that my Dad is a killer trumpet player and the fact that the DJ was spinning Mushroom Jazz (Mark Farina) seriously made my day. I could barely hold a conversation because I was grooving to the smoove tunes so much. Wrote about it on Facebook and got at least 3 people to check it out simply because I was raving about the chill vibe. And if you don't know what Mushroom Jazz is, you should.",

The bloody mary wasn't the best I'd ever had (even though it was rated high in Best of Phoenix) but the Hangover Helper was possibly the best brunch item that I have ever tasted.

Had I reviewed The Vig Uptown on one of those prior outings, I would have easily given it four or five stars. The atmosphere is funky but classy and the staff are all nice and welcoming and attentive. This time, sadly, the food did not measure up. I had the carne asada on a potato pancake and while the flavors were spot on, the steak was so overcooked it was like more like jerky than steak. My boyfriend's french fries were both cold and stale. Ick. It may have been an \"off night\" but unfortunately overcooked meat and cold fries should never have made it out of the kitchen. Someone should have been running quality control. I will come back to The Vig, eventually, but sadly I can no longer rank it among my favorite spots in Phoenix.",

I have been here a couple times, thinking maybe the first time was a fluke, but in both cases the wait to be seated took way longer than quoted and then the server took orders of those around us who were seated after us.  The food takes FOREVER to get to your table, too.  In total, the first time I was there I spent 3 hours start to finish, and the second time I was there took 2 1/2 hours start to finish.  Do NOT get the Vigazz Burger - the bacon was thick so I had high expectations, but all it did was stab my mouth with every bite and it was really difficult to chew - it was rock hard.  I took it off the burger and attempted to eat it separately, but it had NO flavor and was still really difficult to chew.    I will not be returning.",

The food took over an hour to arrive and once it did, everything was so salty (roasted cauliflower, chicken blt, fries) that it was nearly inedible. The place was moderately busy, but no wait and had some empty tables around us, so unless they were down several cooks, something was terribly wrong. The only explanation given was that \"everyone ordered at once\". That might have worked for a 20-30 minute wait, but 60+ minutes for lunch to arrive? And the restaurant was only about 70% full. The hostess thanked us for our patience when she brought out the food, but we had kids in tow and no offer was made for chips, fries, anything while we waited. And waited. To have the food then be bad only added insult to the injury. All restaurants have bad days, and it's how they deal with it that helps me decide whether to give it another chance. So disappointing on all fronts - will not be back.",

Cannot comment on this place as a late bar and hence the 3 stars. Earlier in the evening, you get families with kids eating there, which is not my thing. But otherwise, great.  Will check this out some night around 11pm and see if it moves up to a 4 ;-)",

    "text": "Had made a few visits the the Vig Uptown and have yet to really dig into the menu.  What we have ordered has been super though!  Having been to the Vig in Arcadia, we were pretty familiar with some of the fare. If you like wings, try the Thai sweet chili for an awesome version of this standard bar appy. Tried the nachos, loaded with pork, and it was so big we had to take half of it home.    Really dig the atmosphere here.  The restoration is incredible!  It seems to have become quite popular and could be a challenge getting in at certain times.  Went once and the valets said the lot was full, so we ended up at Dick's knowing that it was packed inside.  Glad to see the place is doing so well.    Hope to make our next stop there for brunch...maybe to catch a World Cup game!",

All of our seven meals were served at almost exactly the same time so no awkward waiting.  I had the chili rubbed salmon with the chorizo corn cake and asparagus and loved every bite.  The portion size was perfect.  They have a good selection of beer (I had the nimbus) imported, domestic, and local.  I had two drafts (1/2 price), and my entree and my bill was $24 before tip.",

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is cuz the service is sometimes less than awesome and they don't have red sangria.  =/   I mean, sangria by definition is red, right? So why only white Vig Uptown? Anywhooo... I digress.  Visited the Vig Uptown for the first time a couple months back. The purpose was just to check the place out and see if it was as cool as the original.  It was. Drinks were good, food was great. I had the Pork Tenderloin salad. AmAzInG! The melon, goat cheese, apples and the yogurt-poppyseed dressing... YuMMM!  Honestly, i want them to offer the salad w/the pork as an option.  Cuz i didn't really care it was there. It was good, but that salad had me at first bite. I had whatever $5 glass of red wine they were offering that night too. Score! The 2nd visit was just a week ago for my birthday. I had about 10ppl in my party and we sat on the couches in the patio. The patio rocks. It has A/C. Love it!  Since my bday fell on a Thursday, we got the summer special of $5 pitchers of sangria! Yep, 40oz of white sangria for 5 bucks. We musta had 10 pitchers amongst us. They also have $5 pitchers of draft beers. I had a Hoegaarden to round out my night.... What?? It was my birthday!  =)  Of course, the food was delicious, yet again. Their Guac is great. The Tandoori Chicken flatbread was awesome and the wings were some of the best i've ever had. Their wings aren't chewy or fatty or drenched in sauce. They are grilled and just delicious!!  Great job Vig. Let's work on that red sangria!  ;-)",

I was back in town in the fall and after brunch across the street at Dick's we needed MORE post-brunch champers.  Over to The Vig we went.    How darn cute!  When I lived in Phoenix, this was a BofA training center and my standard ATM spot.  I like it better as The Vig.  We enjoyed many, many of the $5 mimosas with your choice of fresh juices (orange, grapefruit, strawberry or watermelon).  Yummy!  We stayed so long and drank so many mimosas that we had to order nachos.  They were really tasty.  Sitting out on the patio in late October in short sleeves with friends and champagne was delightful for this Chicagoan.",

    "text": "Went to this place for the 1st time last night.  I'd been to the other one and loved, loved, loved the atmosphere.  For whatever reason, The Vig likes locations that offer no parking to patrons; you're either forced to get in line to valet, or you park somewhere down the street.  So before we even got into the restaurant, we were nearly in a wreck just sitting in line for valet; not a good way to start the evening.  However, the valet guy was quick and friendly, as was the girl at the front desk.  6:30 on a Friday night was a 50 minute wait; not horrible but not ideal.  We squeezed up to the bar and again the service was fast and friendly, then sat back down in the lobby and waited.  Once seated, the server was friendly and really efficient.  Everyone's order looked awesome, especially the pizza.  The salmon dish that I had was the best I'd had in quite awhile; a must try if you are there.  We went with friends and it was a bit loud, so if you're looking for a place to relax, have a nice meal, and chat, this isn't it.  Not that you're rushed, but it's just too loud to really have a conversation (think sports bar loud).    I'll definitely go again but here are my suggestions: 1.  Go after 7pm where you stand a chance to park in the adjacent parking lot (not allowed before 7pm) 2.  Don't go starving because you're going to have to wait 3. Don't plan on having deep, meaning conversations with the people you're with, but do plan on people watching and enjoying some amazing food.  Salud!",

    "text": "My boyfriend decided to take me here one rainy Saturday afternoon, which made everything so much better to start; it was my first time hearing about it, and I am always excited to try new places!   As we walked inside I immediately noticed the contemporary decor, which definitely added to the initial appeal. Once we were seated  (which didn't take long at all), and took a look at the menu I was definitely in a dilemma because everything sounded so good, not to mention the names of the dishes were attractive. Before actually ordering food (since I still had to decide), we got drinks in which were not shy on the liquor (I got their Get Tang'd, which has bacardi O, fresh squeezed OJ, sprite with a Tang rim), and my boyfriend chose a nice glass of red from their extensive wine list...  When it came time to get food we started off with their  Crabmeat Artichoke Dip, which is a mix of a rich cheesy fondue with crabmeat and artichoke hearts, served with spiced pita chips. The only downfall here was that they ran out of pita chips, and had to substitue with tortilla chips, until they were done baking. I wasn't too bummed, since the chips worked just as well, and the waitress soon brought us out some fresh pita bread to enjoy!   For the main coarse we went with their delicious Pad Thai (traditional spicy thai street food with rice noodles, shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts, peanuts, tamarind, egg and lime), which is one of my favorite dishes in the world! I was truly amazed by how well the flavors worked together. What made this dish even better was that we were able to share and still be full!  Overall the service was great! We didn't feel as if we were being rushed, or bothered while eating, and again it was a gorgeous day to go to such a trendy, decently priced restaurant. I would definitely go back, rain or shine...  Also, keep in mind they have two locations, with slightly different menus:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevig.us%2F&s=8fe8dd2970e930ed17a5574c1dcdec1208567659a790407a4d8f0bf4ee98761a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thevig.us</a>    enjoy :)",

    "text": "It is now time after a few visits to chat up the new Vig Uptown for a bit.  It is my belief that this concept, which I call for lack of a better phrase \"the tavern concept\" is the all the rage in the Phoenix (surrounding) F & B scene.  To the credit of the vigsters they sort of started this wave.  I have heard so many times about new places, that are \"Viglike\" or \"A cross between the Vig and something else.\".  So kudos to the Vig for creating a new genre in our AZ scene. The question remains, How did they do at re-creating their own thing?  As is so often the case I wish I had a 1/2 star at my disposal.  I would like to go 31/2.   This is only because as nice as I have found The Vig to be 4 stars just sounds lofty to me for what they are.  Having said that, I choose to round up because they do what they do well and I do not want to knock them down to the blase 3.    The Vig is definatley that good looking girl with nice style and a little edge, that you onlly hope that has a little substance.  The refurbed old bank has clean lines, a great mix and use of materials, a nice flow, and a nice airy feel.  The place is a perect balance of hip and sceney, yet comfortable and the kind of place you want to make a night of, yet a chill place to drop in and have a bite with shorts and flip-flops.  I do wish they would have paid a bit more homage to the bank that they used, but that is just a personal opinion.  I don't know if it is expectation or what but I always expect the food to be a little better than it is.  The menu always has me torn between several enticing and well-described items, which always makes me excited.  The results are a resounding \"fine\".   From the steak sandwich, to the wings, to the chocolate brownie for dessert, they have all been perfectly OK.  I keep going back and I won't stop but it is the atmosphere that drives me. The food somehow seems to lack flavor.  Even when that seems impossible, such as the carne asada over a potato pancake.  Howver, it is good enough to keep coming back.  The service can be a little slow and dis-interested, but I do find the friendliness and attitude to be better at this location, than the original.    So in the end The Vig Uptown is that pretty girl with a lot of style that is nice to have on your arm.  Is she the best cook?  No, but she at least gives it a try.  Will she blow you away with deep conversation about the secrets of the world?  No, but she definatley has something to say.  Is she cool and nice and fun to hang out with?  Heck Yes, I think we will go out again.",

From the outside it looks like exactly the kind of place I avoid, it screams douchebag central, but on the inside it's open and airy and pleasant.  They have a \"patio\" in the back part of the restaurant the while totally enclosed gives the impression of being outside - perfect for Phoenix.  Because it was a Friday night they had a DJ spinning friendly down tempo stuff that didn't intrude on our conversation.  Nicely done.  The nachos with tandoori chicken were excellent and more than enough for two adults.  The service was quick and polite.  There were many food options for late night (we were there after 11pm) and the prices were reasonable.  Now for the bad.  The beer selection was rather weak and they clearly don't serve a lot of Hoegaarden as it came in a regular pint glass.  That is unacceptable.  If they can figure out how to serve beer then they'll have a very good thing going.",

    "text": "The Vig Uptown is a textural dream. For me? This will definitely be a recurring one. Maybe it was the unique \"cactus columns\" upon walking in or the herb garden to the left, but there is truly something charming and down to earth about the new Vig location.  Do some research and modern enthusiasts will quickly find that the remodel of The Vig Uptown was originally Ralph Haver's AIA Award winning 1961 Arizona Bank building. Sweet....  The Vig's food is pretty good. What's great about their menu is that they offer a range of dishes to choose from (many items the same from the Arcadia Vig) so surely there is something for everyone.  I always seem to drink wine when I'm at the Vig Arcadia but I couldn't look past the \"Take Bethany Home\" (Clever!) with Crop Organic Cucumber Vodka, Watermelon Puree, Fresh Lemon & Agave Nectar. A fantastic name with a drink to match.  The booths at this place are huge, great for happy hour (1/2 off Apps and $2 off drinks) We sat at the tables by the bar but the patio looked fun and I'll have to feel that space out next time.  True to it's predecessor, although it was the \"soft opening\" there was already the parking nightmare we've all come to know and (not) love about many places in the valley.   But surely, a good dream is always worth revisiting.",

A great place for groups or smaller parties. It definitely gets busy, and parking is vallet.  Just a great sense of style, taste and casual place to just hang out.  Excellent food, a great combination of different flavors and styles.  Service was excellent, prompt and attentive.  Full bar, excellent wine menu and beer selection.  The salads are excellent, very generous portions,and combinations of flavors.  Make sure you always ask about the specials.  Absolutely incredible.  Generous portions, you will be happy you popped by!",

After getting the runaround trying to make a reservation with the Fillmore location, Brittany went above and beyond to help me make a reservation for 18 people with just two day's notice.  With such a large party, one might not expect top-notch service, but the Vig's staff proved otherwise.  Our server was friendly, attentive, and on-the-ball.  Everyone in my party was pleased with his/her dinner and drinks - we will definitely be returning.  I highly recommend the Vig Uptown for your next celebration.",

    "text": "Lovers of the Old Vig, I know what you're thinking. Is the new Vig as fabulous as the original Vig with their boche ball clad outdoor patio, live music Sundays and a great hang-out any day of the week? Me thinks my answer is...yes!   And here are 10 reasons why:  1. The indoor patio is brightly lit, but saves 'zonians from melting in the heat. It's genius when you think about it. Now you can choose which Vig to visit based on your temperature desires. So, if you want an outdoor patio, go to the other Vig, but when it's 115 outside, I'll see you at the Uptown spot.   2. They serve greyhounds with freshly squeezed grapefruit. You can't find a freshly squeezed cocktail very many places in the land of the desert.   3. Boche Ball. See it exists, even at the new location! And it's large and in charge and big enough for a group to play.   4. Friendly staff. They're attentive, friendly and aim to please.   5. Spacious and perfect for a big group. Check out the area by the fire place. It's perfect for mingling.   6. Awesome spinach dip with these tasty (sweet potato?) bread sticks for dipping.   7. Tastilicious flat bread pizza with Tandoori Chicken - it literally melted in my mouth.   8. Lovin' the Central Phoenix vibe and location. It's close enough to the Camelback corridor and within driving distance for most of the Phoenix/Scottsdale neighborhoods.   9. Great HH specials depending on the day. Check out their $5 Vignature cocktails.   10. And let's not forget about the entertainment. The DJs with accompanying instruments make the Vig rock and I heard a rumor live music is coming soon.   So check it out right this minute!",

The patio area is denititely a great chilling spot, in addtion to a cool play-are for adults and kids. I have been taken many out-of-towners here, and they were all satisfied. Prices are decent; location is great; food quality is good with a nice twist; ambience is chic and trendy; completemary valet parking is a plus, but don't forget the tips. I kudo Vig Uptown.",

    "text": "I like the original Vig a lot and the Vig Uptown is even better for Phoenix since the \"outside\" is actually inside but can be opened up during better weather.    Food- I really like all of the food here.  The vings are pretty good and are a great deal for happy hour.  Also the sliders on happy hour are a great deal.   Prices- This is my only gripe about the Vig.  Outside of happy hour their food is kind of pricey and their drinks really never get that cheap (even during happy hour).  However, it is all worth it for the bocce ball court and the quality of their drinks and food.  Just go during happy hour and you will be glad you did.  Order 2 or 3 of the happy hour food specials and a few drinks.  \"Outdoor\" Patio Area- Like I said, the fact that their patio can be indoor or outdoorish is great since it is way too hot to be outside for some parts of the year.  One problem with it being indoors is that the noise gets trapped inside and during happy hour or late-night it can get pretty loud in there.  Overall I like this place and will probably keep choosing it over the original Vig to stay in the A/C.  Basically everything else from the original Vig is exactly the same.",

    "text": "The Vig Uptown... What a cool, hip place to be. This is the Vig's second location to their 40th Street location. Uptown is a little farther from my area of town, being located on 16th Street & Bethany Home, but I definitely don't mind the drive to enjoy a spiffy drink in a sweet setting. Taking an old bank and converting it into a modern tavern is always a cool layout for a modern hangout. The history of the building gives residents in the area familiarity with the building and helps it become a casual meeting place.  Bocce Ball is one of the best casual games to play and it's perfect while hanging out with friends having a drink and some decent food. Uptown has created an atrium with large windows to open when the weather is under 100 haha and closed to also allow natural light into the patio. The bocce ball area is somewhere I could spend all afternoon and evening hanging out with friends.   The Vig does a great job at their design work to create the cool, hip place to be... somewhere you can spend hours. The drinks here are also why this modern tavern is one of my favorite places to go. They do really good renditions of cocktails that utilize seasonal and fresh fruits, etc. in their drinks. One of my favorites is the Bombasiled ($9): Bombay Sapphire Gin, strawberry puree and fresh basil and a splash of lemonade is a great fresh cocktail. A favorite with the night crowd, that I've noticed, is the Statutory Grape ($9): 3 olives grape vodka, blue curacao, sweet n' sour, grenadine and Sprite. They also have a great selection of craft beers on tap, including the local Four Peaks Brewery.   The food here at the Vig Uptown is also very good for being a modern tavern. Elevated bar food would be close to short changing the food here. Their sweet potato fries are probably my 2nd favorite sweet potato fry in the Valley to accompany the very good VigAzz Burger.   Overall, this is a great place to hang out, have a drink, some good food and enjoy the company of friends. And one of the perks to the Vig.... the VigRig: Their complimentary shuttle service for those who occasionally indulge in the decadent adult beverages.  PS. My only qualm... Cougars. Yikes!",

    "text": "Not gonna lie - didn't hear good things about \"the new Vig\" and I think I know why... keep reading haters.   The Vig Uptown opened in the early spring and if you're from here, The Vig is synonymous with a great patio space. So, the feedback I was hearing was that \"the new Vig is indoors\" yuck. We want a patio.  Well, my friends. Welcome 112 degree days. I think the Vig Uptown is genius for Phoenix. The space absolutely feels very indoor/outdoor still allowing the nice breeze to come through, bocce ball for the boys and a very, open airy place for the daytime - BUT, you can close the windows once the heat wave hits and still enjoy yourself in an open, airy place. Mark my words, when the temperatures heat up and The Vig Arcadia is empty - the Vig Uptown won't be. And it will be filled with those haters looking to \"feel like they're outside - but aren't.\" I promise you.   On top of the cool space, the menu is yummy and the drink specials on the weekends are great. You get 1/2 bottles of wine and the Vig Pinot Gris is delicious and at that prices.. its $12. Yum.   Note - the brunch menu is very limited compared to the full lunch menu, so if you go around 2pm, it's probably in your best interest to wait until the full lunch menu is available. We saw nachos come out about 15 minutes after we ordered and were super bummed nobody told us to wait.   Overall - perfect place to escape the \"inside\" this summer.",

    "text": "This is my 300th review. The end. Hahahaha, just kidding. Well, it *is* my 300th, but I'm actually going to write something. I met my boss here for a dinner meeting. I can walk to this place, but had never been. I know, I'm late to the Vig trend, but when it comes to trendy places, I bush the system somewhat. We needed to find someplace that  had gluten-free options and a lot of people suggested The Vig Uptown. It's WAY bigger inside than you'd think at first. Oh, everyone has to valet and it's free. You go in through a huge orange door (I really like orange. I hate yellow, though.) and can pretty much pick a place to sit unless it's really packed. Luckily, it was a Wednesday night and there were quite a few tables available.  We sat in back next to the bocce ball thing. Is it a court? What would it be called? It's just a long strip of green. Whatever. The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation. There was a guy playing the guitar. It was pretty impossible to hear half of what my boss was saying. I bet he offered me a million dollar raise & I missed it. Just my luck. I had the Cobb salad. Holy cripes! The thing was huge!!! Ok, it was $12 but still, I had to take half of it home to eat the next day. Huge chunks of bleu cheese & bacon. There wasn't too much dressing on it, either. I actually like the taste of vegetables and don't like a lot of dressing on my salads. The service was super friendly and quick to refill drinks. Oh, and the bathroom is super cool, too. The sink is one of those flat ones that makes you feel like you're going to flood the bathroom when you wash your hands. How embarrassing, because people may think you just peed a lot but it's really from the sink. Haha. That would happen to me, too, as well as missing my boss giving me a million-dollar raise.",

Recently a few friends and I decided to go for dinner and drinks for a friends birthday.  The food was great, no complaints there but the service was disappointing.  While still eating we were constantly asked if we were finished, needed boxes or anything taken away.  While I appreciate staff being attentive I felt it was obvious that we were in the middle of eating and had to send the staff away. Our server on the other hand was the complete opposite.  We asked her several times for an extra chair which we finally had to get ourselves.  She would only ask one person if they needed anything, would take one order and disappear.  We asked for extra items with our apps at least 3 times and never received them, had to ask for silverware and napkins and unfortunately did not get to order the drinks we wanted because of her only taking one or two orders at a time.  I am sad to say that I do not know if I will return for food there again after our last experience.",

All in all, the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service.  Just drives me crazy that a restaurant uses the main parking lot for \"free\" valet, when it should be for customers, and valet down to another lot.  No such thing as free... then people sneak into lots down the way to save the tip.  If this was Chicago, or New York I could see it, but not Phoenix.  But don't let that keep you away...",

It's interesting how they turned the old bank into a restaurant.  Love the natural light coming in over the bocce ball court.

    "text": "Why haven't I stopped by for Happy Hour at The Vig Uptown sooner? I should stop being such a shut-in.  Not that the drinks were THAT cheap - but they were good. Well, the one I kept drinking was good. (Moscow Mule - if you like ginger, order it.) My friends and I were hungry, and so we got a little appetizer happy. Ok, we got VERY appetizer happy. We started with the Double Down (Hummus and Baba Ganoush). Pro: if you need extra pitas - and you will - they're free. Just ask. (Or maybe the bartender just gave them to us because we're cute girls?) Let's go with the former idea. We then also ordered The Trifecta, Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip, and Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken. Wow, we ordered a lot of food between the four of us. Well, my friends ordered them, I just ate them. But everything was really tasty. Note: the spicy-mayo that is served with an order of fries has got to have yellow curry in it. And it tastes FANTASTIC.   The bartender service was really friendly (no, not just because he maybe, perhaps, gave us free pita bread). Long story short, I'd like to come here again for food OTHER than appetizers. And I know that there is another Vig, but I'm going to have a hard time going to any Vig other than the Uptown.",

    "text": "I consider the Vig as my version of \"Cheers,\" but with killer, contemporary ambiance, swanky lounge music and great food / drinks.  This Vig is walking / biking distance from my house and I always run into the regulars.  They have specials almost daily, from 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sundays, to $5 burgers on Mondays, to Two for Tuesdays (1 App and 1 bottle of wine for $22).    Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I love the outdoor patio. Maybe it's because I'm a native Arizonan and not used to an overabundance of trees, maybe it's because I like air conditioning in the summer... who knows! Seriously though, the windows let in tons of light during the day and when the temperatures cool down, you get that fresh airy patio feeling without being on a \"real\" patio.  The fireplace is awesome, as is the bocci ball court.   Bar seating is great - be sure to come in when Jason and/or Logan  are working. They are the best!",

We arrived at 6:40 and there were a lot of empty tables however, they were all reserved for parties arriving later that evening. The hostess was quite rude and told us if we wanted to have a table for 4 we would need to leave at 8 pm.  I can't believe that they would \"kick us out\" with about one hour to dine on a Saturday night with friends.  The Vig Uptown has been a go-to restaurant that we have introduced many friends to and I was embarrassed that we recommended this to friends and then told we would have one hour to eat then would need to leave.  Historically, the service and food have been wonderful but based on this experience, I will never return to this establishment.  Very disappointed to say the least.",

Sorry, Original Vig, but the incense just doesn't cut it and I know it's not your fault, but it is what it is....  Uptown Vig is appropriately Sheesh, a bit larger footprint, and the original construction elements of the bank building are tastefully complimented with modern design twist.    Greyhounds are the drink to beat.  Food is OK, mostly go there for the atmosphere and the booze....  I'm in.",

My husband and I are in a constant battle on where to sit in a restaurant. I love love love sitting outdoors, even in the summer, he hates it, no matter how nice the weather is. Its as if the Vig knew this, and found a compromise. It feels like outdoors, complete with an Astra turf bocce ball course, but its enclosed and air conditioned, perfect for Arizona and my marriage.  Our server was friendly, ready with suggestions, timely. We shared a bottle of wine, I think bottles were 1/2 off or something like that, great deal. I had the flat bread pizza with tandoori chicken, it was great, and the boy had vigazz burger, which he was impressed with, so much so that we returned a week later for $5 burgers.  This time we each had a beer, they have a great selection, and a vigazz burger and arcadia burger, which we split. Both were delicious. So were the sweet potato fries and curry ketchup. Loved it.  We will be back.",

Many members of the party approached me throughout the night telling me how much fun they were having, how amazing the restaurant is, and that the food and drinks were excellent!

She didn't have any other tables, but us, and she was beyond rude. She messed up both our orders entirely and was clearly annoyed we even brought it to her attention to be fixed.  My friend felt so uncomfortable that she just kept hers. When she dropped off my plate, she was SO rude that she even gave a sarcastic remark to us. Unbelievable. We brought it to David's attention, the manager, that you could clearly tell said nothing to her about it. As nice as he was, he showed little to know authority among his staff. He kept asking US what we \"wanted\" which was so frustrating because neither of us wanted anything for free, but you can tell he felt thats what we were suggesting. Not at all. We told him we didn't want anything, but our check. We didn't even finish. All we wanted was to be treated well and for her not to treat other guests that way. This location consistently has servers who are in a bad mood or lack decent service skills. Being in the industry myself, I know what is acceptable and what is not. This location is definitely a pass. There's on in Arcadia and one downtown that's not too far. Do yourself a favor. I would never not tip, but there's nothing worse than tipping to a server that clearly deserved nothing.",

    "text": "I have frequented this location since shortly after it's opening. Generally speaking, I like the vibe and decor. The food is average and the drinks are a bit over priced. However, the staff is beyond rude. We came with a large group and the server couldn't keep track of the drink orders and didn't ask people to open tabs. As the bar got busier the server lost track of people and just started charging drinks to random people. In the end, we paid a massive tab many drinks of which I am sure where ordered by people not in our party. When I asked to speak to a manager they said that there was nothing they could do. The manager acknowledged the servers incompetence but wouldn't even reduce the bill. For all we know, the server made those orders up because some of the drinks on the bill were defiantly for things no one in our group drank.  To make matters worse, against my better judgment, I returned a few weeks later and sat at the bar on a slow night with a friend. The bartender was too busy talking to his friend to acknowledge us or take my drink order. I patiently waited and when he finally came over (there were only 5 people in the entire bar) he continued to talk to his friend while begrudgingly taking my drink order.  He served us and then went back to talking outside the bar area. When we needed a refill, we waited again attempting to get eye-contact. Eventually, I decided to walk over and ask him for a drink which clearly annoyed him. We tried to be patient but if you don't want to serve people then  don't take a job as a server. As we sat at the bar, the bartender began putting the stools up fro the night while we were still sitting at the bar. When we asked if was closing early so that we could leave if we were keeping him, he said \"no\" and that he was just getting a head start on closing the bar (last call wasn't for over an hour).  As we sat there several people walked in the door looked around and then left, presumably leaving because they thought the bar was closed or closing with all the bar stools up. While all of this happened the bartender never even noticed because he was too engaged in his conversation with his buddy at the end of the bar. Horrible environment and moronic employee.",

It's much different vibe than the Arcadia and now McCormick Ranch ones. I have yet to wander aimlessly to the downtown one...oh the anticipation!  The crowd here is uber cool, like the stylish hipster type. I love the patio area with the games, especially during the cool nights. The outside seating forces you to want to sit and lounge on the chairs and watch people. Staff never disappoints and food is consistent. I mean if you are going to check out one, check them all out.",

I had Jamison added to the drink, she charged me 7.50 for an additional shot that was obviously not placed in my drink. Which made one drink $15.50.. Which is why I have to provide only a 4 star rating. Staff was friendly but a little slow which was understandable due to the size of our party on the patio. I never received the extra side of cream cheese that I requested but luckily my buddy had some left over. This makes me think that I should rate this place a little lower but I made the best of the ambience and really enjoyed my company. I will definitely be back but with a smaller group and excited to try some of the other dishes.",

No complaints about the food.  Our server only came to the table twice and even forgot to put in one order. It took us 10 minutes to even get her back to our table to tell her his food was missing and then she tried to argue that he didn't order anything!!

Such a shame too because this used to be such a nice place.  I ordered the Bedhead Pizza.  The menu said it had bacon, egg and spinach.  The egg was barely cooked.  It was runny and still clear in parts.  Disgusting to be served still raw egg.    My husband ordered the Hangover Helper.  The menu stated it was topped with 2 over easy eggs.  When we mentioned this to the server she wen back to the kitchen to ask about this.  She came back and gave us a line about how that is wrong on the menu and that now the eggs are scrambled into the meal.  She said she could have eggs brought out to top it.  When we asked to see a manager she went back again, she said he gave us 50% off of his meal.  That was $5 off his meal.  NOTHING off my raw meal.  So off of a $37 meal we were given a $5 discount.  REALLY??? The manager NEVER came to talk to us.  He never came to the table.  HE NEVER came out to the floor.  He just stayed in the back and let his server deal with 2 very angry people.  WEAK WEAK WEAK.   You have lost 2 loyal patrons and believe me we will tell our friend who also frequen your establishment for brunch AND at night for drinks.  SAD.",

If you time it right, you can catch live musicians or a DJ; some weekends, both in concert, together! The atmosphere is among the best in Phoenix, and one of the reasons why Central Phoenix is such a great spot for dining and adult beverages. The bonus on top of the ultra fun, mid century modern aesthetic in the former bank building (the stained glass casts a delightful hue come late afternoon) is the Vig Rig! So, if you want to indulge in the fun Vig beverages, you can get to and fro super safely.",

    "text": "I would have set my rating at 4.5 stars. The Vig is my new fav place to go in Phoenix. here's why: it's a 5min drive from our house. They have free (tipped) valets. They have great Happy Hour specials. The menu has a wide variety of creative delectables suitable to every palate; all priced exactly right. There are so many dishes on it that sound amazing I was instantly planning a return visit my fist time there. I've had the grilled chicken sandwhich with amazing coleslaw and their juicy burger (as a lettuce wrap) which had lightly caramelized red onions which is a nice touch as I dislike totally raw onions but love them blanched. The staff is attractive and friendly. The atmosphere and decor are EXACTLY what I look for in a favorite: dim lighting but tasefully accented. a gorgeous bar with a stunning lit up \"Booze Waterfall\" on the backbar (as a former barman, a nightmare for the staff to clean I'm sure- just gorgeous!) A bar any single could comfortably saddle up to and surf the net or chat with folks. Huge comfy booths that could squeeze in 8 I'm sure, yet they put couples there if they have them available.  Booths that are dim and judging by all the canoodling couples, perfect for date nights- gay and straight given the several same-sex couples I saw one night, which is always a good sign and awesome. A MASSIVE indoor/outdoor lounge with huge windows that easily open on pleasent days and seal out the heat with duct in A/C during triple digit days. Tasteful and ecclectic background music. They can accomodate groups and the lounge which also features bean-bag toss game would be perfect for a corporate or private party. A cornicopia of merrits to be sure! The only down side for me is that they have a kids menu and the kids also like the bag toss game both of which will encourage families with small kids. I generally detest children and only mildly tolerate any children of friends and family. I'm a proud, childless,\"Adults-only\" kind of guy that will walk out of any restaurant containing more than 3 kids total within ear-shot. But for the 2 or 3 Chicken-fingers-and-fries guests that were there on both my visits, I would up the star-rating to a solid 5!  Despite that one small subjective to myself flaw,  this place is now  my new touchstone by which I will compare other places. I dig The Vig!",

    "text": "I had visited the Vig Arcadia sometime last year and was underwhelmed at my experience but seeing a Local Dines for the Vig Uptown, I decided it would be worth trying it again at a different location.   We tried to call ahead and get on the list around 6:15pm on Friday night. While they don't let you call ahead and put your name on the list, the hostess said it would only be a 20-30 minute wait and she thought it could be faster so even though we were starving, we decided to head out.   We arrived about 30 minutes later and the valet parking was a bit confusing. We pulled up to the valet stand and no one was there. Just beyond the stand there was a sign that said the lot was full so I got out and looked around for someone to help us. About that time, the valet came up while I was still standing next to the car. He instructed my fiance  to pull up the car another 20 feet to the front door and then took the car to be parked. Not sure why he couldn't have taken it there and it seemed a little odd but I figured they were pretty busy.   We entered and no one was at the hostess stand initially. Someone appeared a few minutes later but didn't seem to be in charge of the area and ignored me. Finally, a friendly hostess appeared and put us down and said it would be 20-30 minutes. We stood in the corner since the 4 cube seats were taken. I thought about maybe sitting on the patio to wait until every person that come from outside reeked like smoke. I overheard her mention to someone else that it was the 'smokers patio'...so much for fresh air so you might keep that in mind if you're hoping to sit outside. After a 35 minute wait, we were finally taken to our table.  As we sat down in our booth and realized how loud it was, we decided to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. It was crowded but it still shouldn't have been as loud as it was. Our waitress came after a few minutes and took our drink and appetizer order. We opted for the wings and the tater tots. Someone arrived with the wings a few minutes later and we figured the tots would be out shortly. With the wings nearly gone, she finally came back to check on us and when we asked about the tot's, she said she hadn't heard our order and she would get them out fast. Totally couldn't blame her though since it was so loud. I didn't try the wings but my fiance said they were 'okay'.   We ordered the Carne Asada to share for dinner, figuring the tots would fill us up. Shortly after she left, the tots came out. While they were huge and I think you get 6 or 7, they weren't great. The first one I ate had no cheese in it and the dipping sauce didn't taste like much. The tots didn't have a whole lot of flavor either and I would have preferred frozen Ore Ida over these! I kept trying to salt them but nothing helped. I asked the person who brought the tots for a side of ranch and also a refill on my drink.  The ranch arrived a few minutes later and then the refill another 3-5 minutes after that.   We did finally receive our dinner too and while it was very tender and had good flavor, our whole experience so far had kind of trumped the dinner. Our waitress disappeared forever and never came to check back on us to see how our dinner was. When she eventually did reappear, she apologized for the wait and I think she said 'Sorry for the wait, I kept cutting myself and I had to take care of that first'...HUH? I still am not 100% sure what she said but that's sure what it sounded like. She did bring the bill and thankfully our bill was only $7 after the local dines credit. It took another lengthy amount of time to get the check to sign but she did apologize...again...for taking so long.   When we left, we were at least thanked for coming in. When we walked out someone held the door open for us and thanked us too. Then began another valet fiasco. Our car was 3rd in line parked and just across from the valet stand. We walked up to the stand but nobody was there except a man, who I assumed was waiting for his car. Then someone appeared, took out our keys and then said he would be back to help us and laid our keys on the stand. Having our car 20 feet away and rather than have to wait around for him to help someone else and THEN pull out our car, we grabbed our keys and started walking over to our car. Instead, we were scalded by another valet that he would move our car and informed us 'there is a line'. You mean the one guy now standing by the valet being helped? Whatever. I get these urban places have crappy parking but this whole valet is such a joke. I know they have a system for how they get cars in and out of the parking lot but its chaotic and they were never friendly and we were just ready to go.  At this point, both the Vig's have struck out in my opinion and I'll find other places to dine.   One star for the ambiance (because it's swanky inside and might be a cool patio but it would be so much more enjoyable without all the noise) and another for...the carne asada?",

The waitresses there were extremely nice and took our orders right away. The waitress even said to wait 10 minutes when I ordered a draft beer so it could be on special.  I ordered the Vigazz Burger and can honestly say it is top 3 Burgers I have ever had. The bread was fresh, the meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the cherry on top. The sweet potato fries were great and the portion size was perfect, especially for only $11 dollars!  Definately a great place to bring a date or grab some drinks with friends, not so much not family friendly but just catered towards 20-40 year old crowds.  Will definitely be coming back when in the area again, until then I can only dream about the Vigazz...sigh.",

Famished from a hike I drank 3 waters and my 3 lemonades quickly. They even preempted my next glass at one point, which made me very happy. I received a little box for my tiny portion of a Trifecta sliders which were on point with a well-buttered pretzel bun. The season fries were spicy and that's how I like it. I hope to come back and enjoy some DUCE BAG/ CORN HOLE on my next visit. This is a great place for small to large groups and will be in my wanting memory for times to come. :D",

On Sunday's they have half off bottles of wine. We ordered a nice bottle of white pinot and complimented the fish very well. The folks split a reuben sandwich and it was phenomenal. We have a high standard when it comes to deli meat and, believe me, this sandwich was on point. The corned beef was still dripping its own juices and garnered bits of fat that accentuated the entire flavor of the sandwich.  All in all, very good. Might have to come back to The Vig for happy hour.",

The staff was friendly and attentive the entire evening and the food was outstanding to say the least.   I had called a few hours before to get directions and also find out what type of wait we were to expect on a Saturday night for 4...they said it would be bout 15-20 minutes.  We showed up and and we're seated within 5 min even though it was busy!  Great vibe and great scenery... If you get my drift. :)  Megan, you are awesome!  Can't wait for cooler weather so we can try out the patio which looked amazing.  We will definitely be back with even more friends soon!!",

What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!  Drinks 1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.  2. If you bring in your own \"pimp cup\" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.  Food 1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing. 2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.",

I came here with 2 boys to watch the college championship football game and I have to say this was the perfect place to do so. The restaurant was perfectly filled for a Monday night, not crowded so was seated right away. Right next to a big TV. The night seemed to go by so quickly. We were greeted by our waitress for drink orders as soon as we sat down. Not long after food orders, our appetizers came then our main! It was all out within 20 mins, literally. My bf and I started out with the chips & guac. I am picky with guac and theirs is excellent! Our friend ordered the wings and omg, their take on traditional wings is so good! I really only like bbq wings but their traditional wings are so tasty. Next my bf and I shared The Trifecta which is 3 sliders with fries. We were craving burgers/sliders and WOW. Just wow. 3 perfect sized mini burgers with cheese, grilled onions, and spicy mayo on fluffy pretzel buns. Comes with pickles but I opted for them on the side for my bf cos I don't like them. It comes with wonderfully seasoned skinny fries. PERFECT. Just perfect. I'm not sure why it's in the appetizers section but it was the most perfect dish for my bf and I to share to fulfill our craving. I think I could eat these every day if I could. No joke. Our friend ordered the steak salad which visually looked beautiful. Our dinner happened so fast, we ended up just sitting and watching an entire quarter upon finishing. If I wasn't so full, I would have gone for some dessert. I even did some work on my computer there and it picked up their wifi which was nice. Oh, and our water glasses were always always full. The restaurant itself has a real chill vibe and a semi outdoor section with a bonfire pit and corn hole. All in all, love this place.",

The home fries weren't seasoned at all and the egg sandwich (breakfast sandwich) was inedible. The tomatoes on the sandwich weren't ripe, the croissant was not durable enough to hold it together + it was soggy, the cheese was over cooked as well as old ingredients were used. My mother had French toast with blueberry compote. The french toast was fine, but the bacon on her plate was molded and also inedible. The manager tried to tell us we were confused, \"that's our version of the breakfast sandwich; that was just blueberries on the bacon\". The service was terrible as well. After speaking with the manager we waited at least 15 minutes for the check and another 15 minutes before we finally got up and paid at the bar because our waitress never returned. All in all, we were very displeased.",

They kind of won because most of the restaurants I kept finding on Yelp that I wanted to try ended up being closed on Monday. The Vig was definitely busy on a Monday night, maybe as a result of everyone else being closed.  Monday night is $5 burger night. My husband went for that. He really liked it. He said it wasn't an amazing culinary experience but that you could tell all the ingredients were really high quality. So a delicious, standard burger. Also the mustard that came with the fries was so so so good. It was a curry mustard, genius, I'm totally adding curry powder to my mustard at home now.  I went for the fish taco salad. I'd desribe it more as a fish taco platter. You still get little tortillas so you can make some tacos. You get an intact piece of grilled fish and then a bunch of toppings. I ate everything on that plate. Super tasty.  I got the hot habby drink which is a lot like a margarita with habanero in it. I really enjoyed it and would totally get it again.  The space itself was really cool. They have a lounge, a sweet patio, lots of giant booths and a community table. We ended up at the community table and it was great. If your're there to watch a game you get a great view.   I love that they have a complimentary cab type service to and from there on Friday and Saturdays (I have no idea what the boundaries are). That's such a great idea!  We will definitely check this spot out again when we're in Phoenix.",

The inside is pretty dark where we sat. They had modern music playing. Pretty upbeat but not rocky.   Anyways, I ordered the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was interesting with grilled red onions, tomatoes, cheese, and greens. It looked really good but tasted ok. Let me put it this way. Not a lot of taste. I really loved the sweet potato fries. Overall, I thought it was an okay meal.   My wife ordered the Turkey sandwich which had tons of turkey with coleslaw and cranberry on a pretzel roll. Nice combination. I stole a quick bite and it was really good.    The service was really good. We were greeted quickly at our table. Drinks were at our table quickly and refills regularly.

Try the soy garlic edamame and you will never ratio anywhere else. The pazole is a surprising delight. Drinks are always on point.   Unfortunately the service at this one is frequently less then stellar. Assume you will be ignored for the first 10 minutes of your visit, assume you will have to stalk your waiter for another drink. Particularly disappointing this time was when I asked Christian our waiter for a cup of coffee during brunch he gave me \"the look\" and asked me if I was \"really going to make him work\". This was of course after we had to ask the bus boy who the hell our winter was after sitting for 15 minutes. While he said he could go to the trouble of brewing a pot of coffee (which would have taken less time then the conversation he proceeded to engage in complaining about it) I passed. We didn't really see him after and that's probably better.",

I didn't do any research on the place so when I pulled in and my door was opened by some strange man I was sorta thrown off, but overcame that quickly as I walked toward the restaurant.   I didn't see any signs saying it was valet parking, so that's why I was a little caught off guard.  Once inside I got to check out the place , its retro with a cool vibe, I could see how hanging out at the Vig has become popular. My friend and I were headed to another event so eating wasn't really what we were into, but after a quick look at the menu we decided on some guac & chips and grilled fish tacos. The guac was fresh and creamy; the added pico went great with it. The fish tacos though stole the show, the tomatillo & avocado salsa on blacken white fish with spicy slaw, explosion of flavors! I might have to go back soon just for that! So good!  The Vig is a great place to start your happy hour off at, nice drink selection and food choices! Look forward to coming back",

All apologies to our friends from the kingdom of Siam, but The Vig has the best Pad Thai on this celestial plane. Excellent beverage choices, fun and happy staff. Very cool, slightly industrial architecture. Valet parking displeases me, but probably forced on them by the neighborhood. An acceptably small downside",

We had the pork belly & watermelon appetizer and that was delicious! I had the adult mac & cheese and my hubs had a burger. The food was good. We sat in the back area and it was really loud. There was a DJ (not that great) and a group of people playing corn hole that were just so loud and carrying on about the game...it was kind of annoying. Lots of f-bombs being dropped...not that I have I have virgin ears but come on!    The service was excellent, wait staff was attentive and friendly.   The one thing I did not like at all is that you pretty much have to valet park your car and I had no cash on me...luckily I was able to tip an additional $5 and the waitress gave me the $5 in cash.  We will try their other locations soon!",

Got a booth & it was a bit of a wait for our server to get drink order- but it was the end of lunch crowd & we were not in a hurry by any means. Drafts were nice & cold. We placed our orders, Hubby always has a request for simple/basic burger where ever we go & our Server was able to get it done for him & it was 'really good!'. I got the Black bean burger w'/ side o'Mac n Cheese. Burger was great, Mac was a bit watery-( but I'm OK with just about any Mac!..I ate it all & could have had more.) Love the decor and atmosphere.

I took my sales team there for dinner and we reserved one of the back patio couch areas for dinner and drinks.  What a great place!   I loved that back patio area and the bocci and corn hole options.   We were a larger group so we had 2 servers and both were amazing.  Extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food is upscale bar food, so there was something for everyone.   Even my colleague with some dietary restrictions.  We ordered several apps for the table including guacamole, edamame, and their charcuterie board. All was quite delicious.   Everyone ordered their own thing but I had the short rib tacos and they were amazing!  The meat was extremely tender and had a fantastic tasting asian sweet glaze.   The drinks were tasty, strong, and reasonably priced.   All in all, this was a fantastic evening out.  Although I say I like to try new places whenever I travel to Phoenix, I will most likely return to The Vig.  Great place!",

Prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area and if you're just looking for a guaranteed place for a group of people and relax, here is  your spot && their Happy Hour will support that :)   Personally, I'm a fan of their appetizer/small plate menu ... give me the wings...all the wings...any day.  But if it's happy hour, I'll order the entire happy hour menu too...even though I wont be able to eat it all on my own...it's all delicious. But for real the wings :) :) :) :) :) :)  // cheers //",

I don't know anyone who will spend $17 for grapes, a strawberry, a tiny slice of old prosciutto and cheap salami that tastes like old refrigerator and the *rind* of Brie cheese when the Whining Pig is practically next door.   Luckily the server was really nice, super understanding  and took the charcuterie board away and brought us out the Best Turkey sandwich, which is quite literally the best turkey sandwich and a burger for my husband.",

Looks like a great place to drink- we don't drink. Staff was Very friendly- all of them.   Parking is Valet only...  :(  Ordered ice tea, plain. Received some sort of flavored tea...I hate that. My husband Loved the Arnold  Palmer he ordered. Shoe string fries, ok. Onion rings very tasty.",

We were seated outside on a beautiful evening. Unforunately, a group with about 15-20 gymnastists were there too! They appeared to be in the 7-10 yr old range. They were running around screaming in their high-pitched little girl voices! The parents did NOTHING to quiet them down. I have no problem with bringing kids to a restsurant, but this was over the top loud and obnoxious. We couldnt even talk! The employees didnt say anything to the girls or their parents. I asked the girls twice to be a little bit quieter to no avail. We couldnt leave fast enough. So disappointed. The food was decent but we will never go back!",

Time to go and we head out to the complimentary valet...they couldn't find my friend keys. After 5 minutes I look over and can see the car in the lot. I notice the drivers window is down so I walk over there and the damn keys are in the car and it's running...!  None of the valets had any idea about it or could tell is how long it was running. For all we know it was running the entire time we were there...just over 2 hours.   Really doubt I'll be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "\"Extremely Cool Without Being Pretentious\"  Second time at the Vig Uptown.  Brunch.  Just really cool modern surroundings... but not just surface modern, but deep modern aesthetics that just feel comfortable and real.  Sat in the atrium type outside, which is really like an inside garage with big windows and air conditioning.  It's like being outside in the best temperature in Phoenix, even if it's over 100 degrees.  Food was very good.  Relatively large portions for an upscale establishment.  My wife had the $15 salmon, recommended by the server as the best thing on the menu, and it did not disappoint.  Would easily cost 2x at other restaurants, and probably be worth it.   I had the Hangover cure, and it was easily enough food to take home and have for breakfast the next day.  Very tasty for $10.  And I got the $3 spicy bloody mary that came with it, which was one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.  At noon, on the Sunday we went, a really nice band came in and played some great acoustic rock, very nice.    It was one of the best brunch experiences we've had in Phoenix.  Add to this the fact that all wine on the menu, if ordered by the bottle, is 50% off, and that's an outstanding deal.  We'll be back.  I kicked myself for not coming back sooner.    My five star is a rating that is influenced by pricing.  I am a cheap bastard with expensive tastes, so I reward a restaurant that I not only feel I had great food, nice ambiance, and good service, but that I got my money's worth.  And The Vig Uptown is all that and then some.  I strongly recommend it to all.",

Very loungy, very laid back. Surprisingly empty due to the fact that it was a Saturday after payday - but then again, my premonitions of people behavior is rarely correct.   I had a drink, and I had a massively loaded plate of hummus. Very tasty. My party was worn out, and besides that I think this place could be a perfect place to unwind. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, even if the oh-so-stereotypical DJ tried his best to lay tracks that no one was interested in. (DJs fascinates me - due to the lack of originality in their appearance.)  I don't think I have more to say about this place - it wasn't what I expected, and I think that is a relief.",

The stylish interior sets the perfect mood during the day for a relaxing meal, or at night if you're looking for the nightlife.   The meals are simple yet exquisite to the taste. If you're having trouble choosing a meal, go for the hot chick. The Hot chick consist of a great tasting spicy chicken sandwich; I'll leave the rest of the description for your taste buds.  The drinks are cheap and one of the best in the city. I had a gin cucumber, the bartender recommended me and I adopted this drink as my go to favorite.",

Who closes when there are still 15 guests and the hours say open till 12:00?  Guess it's another one of those situations where the staff picks the hours of operation rather than the owners who actually post them.

We were pleasantly surprised when we walked inside. We could seat ourselves so we decided to sit in the courtyard area where there was plenty of open tables. There was a warm fire pit surrounded by tables and benches. They had Trivial Pursuit cards on all the tables and there was an area with bean bags to play cornhole. There was live music, two gentleman playing guitar with voices like angels. We sat and listened until they ended their set because they were THAT GOOD! We had some drinks which were delicious and not light on the pour. We had a few appetizers (Edamame and the Spinach, Artichoke, Jalapeno Dip) and for entrees we had the 3 Cheese Mac & Cheese and the Shrimp Pad Thai. All of which were delicious. We had an amazing mudslide in a mason jar for dessert. We had an amazing night here & we will probably be stopping back in while we are in town! Highly recommend!",

Our waitress was Raven (whom John H also recommends) and she was great.  Very helpful and friendly.  I have to say, for an upscale place with a snooty vibe, the service was impeccable!  She kept our drinks full and kept the table clear of used dishes.  We started with the crab and artichoke dip.  It came with these weird sweet potato chips that were covered in some spice combination I couldn't quite place.  The chips were thick and firm with a lot of flavor.  The dip was full of crab (surprising) and had a great texture to it.  I really enjoyed it.  For my entree I had a pork tenderloin salad.  It was possibly the strangest looking thing on the menu and I just couldn't resist.  The tenderloin was sliced into about 9 pieces and displayed very nicely over the bed of arugula, dried fruit, hazelnuts, and some wicked lemon dressing.  It was an awesome combo that was EXACTLY what I had been looking for that day.  Really enjoyed it!  Happy hour is something like 3-6 with half off most appetizers and like $2 off drinks.  The menu is pricey but not Scottsdale pricey and I feel like the value is there.  Sit outside, if you can.  You won't regret it.  I'm glad we went for the opening because I doubt I'll ever be able to get back in here once the neighborhood finds out what a jewel they have.",

Seemed like a good deal for me since he didn't have to do his job for free. He declined and told us to park across the street. I thought valet was setup to be a convenience.. However it was an inconvenience for us to run through traffic with heels on. You lost business today.",

More so than Arcadia. Not that it's a competition. I like the bar out back too. Not that I had drinks in the mid of the afternoon! I had a international trip to fly later that day. It's super trendy...as is the other Vig. Cool atmosphere and very busy. Complimentary valet. I like that , if they are gonna force a valet on you, for sure. I had the seasonal salad: shrimp, cojita cheese, greens, pear, I had them hold the carmelized nuts, and balsamic on the side. I loved it! My boyfriend had the salmon...It came on a corn cake, with mango salsa. All plates clean. Winner , Winner this Vig's a Winner.",

They were like very large fried tater tots but there was melted american cheese inside; served with two dips; one jalapeno mayo and the other ketchup. We would order them again!    My wife had the roast beef sandwich on a pretzel bun, stuffed full of roast beef, melted cheese and a large bowl of au jus as a dipping medium, we asked that the chipotle mayo be served on the side and it proved a worthy dip as well.   Fries (seasoned) were perfectly crisp (a little too salty for me but still very good).   I had the sliders...excellent, lots of food inside the mini pretzel buns on which they were served.   We shared the Banana Bread Pudding dessert, also excellent. Our first visit and glad we came.   The waitress (don't know her name but she volunteered that she was from Memphis) was excellent, checked on the table frequently without being intrusive.",

WEAK!! that or they can't hear over the noise. Anyways they definitely wont give you any time if you aren't in their section...  Good stuff, um $5 burger Mondays is pretty cool.  I WOULD NOT pay their regular price for their burgers because they aren't on that caliber to be asking that much for them.  The rest of their food is good. not great. Fun atmosphere except when you get kids running around and screaming like banshees. That might contribute to the annoyed wait staff, cause they have to dodge them constantly.

    "text": "OK, here's my comparison of the two Vigs:    The Vig is better than Uptown when the weather is nice and it's not too hot.  There's nothing better than being outside on the back patio listening to live music.  The Vig Uptown will be better in the middle of summer.  It's nice and open and airy and will be much cooler.  I was at Uptown yesterday and got a nice seat at the bar and enjoyed watching the Dbacks game on a large flat screen in hi def.  I had a $4 margarita that was on happy hour special.  It was well made so I had a second and just chilled out watching the game.  It was the perfect mid-afternoon break.  I'm not wild about having to valet park but that's the way it goes.  I wish that I lived a little closer so that I could get to both of the Vigs more often.",

My favorite time is happy hour. The Vig has a nice variety of food and beverages on their happy hour menu. You can enjoy sitting inside or out in the covered yard area. I prefer the yard area because it is more open.   I would give the Vig 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of parking spaces and need to use their valet service. I like to have the option.",

The hostess was so gracious in trying to hold a table for us but alas a few members of my party were tardy so we ended up by the fire pit area which was very nice. Our waiter William a.k.a Billy was AWESOME! I swear he went above and beyond the call of duty that night.  Sunday nights (and day for that matter) are half off bottles of wine. Between that and their awesome menu, what more can you ask for. I ordered the Vigazz burger which was huge, messy and oh so good. Top that with a side order of sweet potato fries and I was in heaven. All the ladies seemed to enjoy their meals as well, from various sandwiches to the warm apple cobbler that another friend ordered. I am not a fan of cooked fruit but let me tell you, that was some good tasting apple cobbler.  Billy evenly split all our bills up down to the wine. I swear he was the best. I do prefer this location over the other as it is bigger and you are able to spread out. If you happen to be in the area, definitely stop on by. I doubt you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "I really like this place a lot!  I've been here a few times and the food has always been excellent and reasonably priced.   If you go, the \"Hot Totties\" are a must appetizer! They are so good! As for entrees, I've had both the \"Vigazz\" and \"Arcadia\" burgers. Both are excellent. Plus! If you go Monday after 6, the Arcadia burger is only 5 bucks! Down from I believe 11 dollars. The last time I went I had the pot roast dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. It was a rather large portion cooked to perfection.  Just a heads up though, this place is always busy. So be prepared to wait a little for a table.   I went to this place a couple of days ago, it was a Thursday night and it was packed. Because it's always busy, some times the servers will forget about you.   It took a few minutes for a server to acknowledge my wife and I, we didn't have utensils when our meal came, the server didn't check on us. We had three different people who had taken our order, got us our food and gave us the check.   To be fair though there was a rather large party next to us, 20-plus people, so I'm sure that had an influence on how our servers took care of us.   All-in-all, I'd come back and recommend this place. I really need to hit this place up for happy hour! Half-price appetizers? Yum!",

Each time has been a good experience; although I've also experienced the occasional \"lapse\" in service when the server/waitress disappeared for long, extended periods of time that did not go over well with my guests. The bigger issue I have is, in this day and age, any organization worth its salt not having a decent website seems obscene. If anyone attempts to find information via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevig.us&s=5aa7f760f727a430c8ddb193f3055899a6d7d35655679ff90a6bdfad39eeab8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thevig.us</a>; which seems their official website, they will be sadly, and for me, unbelievably, disappointed.  Only via reading YELP was I able to ascertain that there is in fact a Happy Hour; although I still don't know the hours and what are the \"offerings\" for Happy Hour. Additionally, what restaurant doesn't have their menu, hours, etc. available for all the world to see? It is a shame, and makes me say, \"Really?\" The Vig cannot find a decent website designer and manager, or worse, is it just not important?",
