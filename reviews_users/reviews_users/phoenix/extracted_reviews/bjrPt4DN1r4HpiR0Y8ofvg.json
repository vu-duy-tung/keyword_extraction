On Christmas morning we wanted a coffee and found out that BC was open! Ever since then I have ditched starbucks and dutch bros completely, they just don't compare! I love that BC has punch cards so I can earn free coffees, and I also like being able to call in an order if I'm in a hurry. The owners (Don and Tima) are incredible and very friendly. Every time I come in Don greets me and plenty of other customers by name. They truly care about their customers here and treat them like friends. I would definitely recommend the Black Cat to everyone, not just coffee lovers. They have lots to offer! :)",

He was very outgoing and I actually felt like he was interested in the conversation we shared. A drink called the Black Cat Bomb  with very inviting and vibrant lettering was advertised on a chalk board next to the register, and was explained as the pride and joy of the coffee house. He made me the drink and topped it off with a dome lid for extra which was a nice touch. The Bomb tasted great, but does seems like a once in a while drink. I will for sure be back for my daily coffee needs! Great experience!",

Upon entering the Black Cat, I immediately felt a peaceful vibe. I ordered a medium iced vanilla latte, and it was incredibly creamy and amazing. The medium was a large anywhere else, so you definitely get a lot for your money! The natural lighting and fresh air from the open doors was great. I live in Chandler but spend an unreasonable amount of time in coffee shops, so you can bet I will be back here often!",

    "text": "First,  let me disclose, I'm not a coffee drinker. (But tea drinkers - I got you, no worries!)  But, don't let that stop you from reading my review or disregard my awesome rating of Black Cat Coffee House.  I have my reasons, I promise!   Read on...   I LOVE this place!   After 8 years of graduate school visiting many, many coffee shops throughout Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix - this is THE place I've been searching for all my life!  (or at least my academic life!)    Free internet makes for a productive work day and with Over Easy next door, there's great people watching for the casual coffee-goer too!   So, why does a non-coffee drinking coffee-shop hopping academic have to say about this place?  So many things!  where to begin?    The tea choices...ahh, the tea choices!!!  It's as though I found the end of the rainbow - tea lovers rejoice, b/c this is the place to go for our \"pot o' gold\" (in the form of many, many delicious flavors of tea.)   My favorite:  Cactus Blossom.  I like it iced.  Get it. And I highly recommend you just go ahead and get the medium or large, because I suspect you'll love it as much as I do!   So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here!!!   Maybe the kiwi-strawberry iced tea as a cool alternative for the summer months?  or Passionfruit.    They also have many more traditional and non-traditional tea flavors.  So many choices, what to do??!?    Also  - my friends who are crazy coffee-aholics like to the coffee here, so while I cannot personally validate it, I would tend to believe them.   Second reason I love this place: the lighting!   As anyone who spends much time in coffee shops may have realized, often coffee shops are dark.  I like sunshine.  I do live in Phoenix, after all!   There are tables outside and inside, the doors fold wide open and plenty of light gets in, so even if you are slaving away over a paper or dissertation, you'll still soak up some Vitamin D and feel like you are in the land of the living.   Third reason:  I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm super impressed with food options.  Here's what I've discovered in my coffee shop days - the food is either uber healthy, made for the granola-earth biscuits out there who just rode their bicycle 60 miles in the 115 degree sun to stop in and pick up a green tea, 3 carrot sticks and a vegan cracker for dessert.  (nothing wrong with that, just not everyone's thing)  OR on the other hand, it's a giant double-sized triple chocolate cheesecake, massive bearclaw with a side of donut holes, and a caramel-chocolate-raspberry muffin, which has the caloric equivalent of 6 Big Macs \"super sized\".  So - if you want something more than a seaweed cracker, but don't want to gain 15 lbs from a muffin, this place gets it done.   You can choose from a variety of healthy food options, hot or cold breakfast/lunch items, and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too!   Last - the staff are all friendly and welcoming.  The owner or manager (not sure) has personally stopped by each time I've been there to say hi and check in on how things are.   The place is immaculately clean and the music is mellow and relaxing. The hours are excellent.     Oh - and tax is included, so the price you see is what you pay.  That's a pretty cool difference from most places!   And drinks are affordable!!    So, stop by - I'll be the one basking in the sunshine in the corner -  just don't take my spot!   =)",

This place doesn't have the pretentiousness you find at Echo or Lux (ugh Lux) and that's what I like. I am comfortable when I walk in and the baristas are friendly. I also thought the prices were fair and they surprisingly have a good selection of pastries, desserts and even in-house sandwiches. They also have smoothies and blended drinks which is why I will be dropping by a lot in the summer. So if you want good coffee (or a smoothie) without \"the scene\", then the Black Cat is your place.",

Also, the WiFi was fast and reliable, so I didn't have to wait an eternity to get things done.   The service was great. The barista was very friendly and gave plenty of recommendations for good iced tea flavors. I ended up going with the Pomegranate green tea, which had a nice sweetness to it, but was balanced well by the tartness from the pomegranate flavor. Especially on a hot Phoenix day, it was a very refreshing iced tea!  If you're in the area, I definitely recommend coming here to get some work done, relax for a bit, grab an iced tea or coffee, etc.",

They also have a few things other cafes don't have, like Thai iced tea! Atmosphere is excellent, good music (mostly alternative), and still pretty relaxed even when they're busy. Best when it's comfortable temperature out and they have the front window open. Service has almost never been a problem, and the manager always says hi. If I have any \"dislikes\" would be that they have very little food, but only because I don't care for sandwiches, but what we've eaten there was good quality.",

    "text": "Another long overdue review. I've been going to Black Cat for at least 18mos and these cats (heh - see what I did there?) are True aficionados when it comes to coffee. Their expertise, knowledge of their craft, and what's required to maintain the equipment all shows in the final product - the glorious coffee that's handed to the customer.   The products are amazing - if you're accustomed to crappy, yet overpriced, espresso that's regularly burned and then served with a smile from a well-known chain, you'll be more than pleasantly surprised by the natural toffee flavor that shines through their espresso. Getting a latte? The flavor is perfect without piles of whipped cream, sweeteners, and other sugar-laden additives.   There's also comfy seating indoors, outdoor seating that's dog-friendly (so go ahead and bring your furry friend with you), free wifi, yummy food, and an amazing selection of teas for the days you might want something that's not coffee. Their hours can't be beat, either.",

    "text": "Wow -- I've found another great local coffee house! Being a grad student, coffee houses are my second home, and I much prefer the locally-owned type.   I found this place by accident one day on my way back to PHX from Scottsdale, along Indian School Rd. The name intrigued me and it was fairly hot outside, and a cold beverage was in order. The guy whipped up a perfectly blended mocha with coconut for me - YUM!    The interior is long and narrow, and kinda dark (which is fine with me, just mentioning it). The tables along the wall are the bistro/pub set type, which I really like. A sofa and a couple comfy-looking chairs are towards the front, along with 3-4 regular-height tables with four chairs each.   Black Cat has a frequent visitor program, so be sure to pick up a card at the register -- buy 9, get the 10th free. There's a little outside seating, and they have free Wi-Fi. Also, their prices up on the board already include AZ and PHX tax...I wish everyone in town did that.   Compared to other local coffee houses like Urban Beans that has a full-on breakfast/brunch/lunch menu, they have a couple of salad options and a few sandwiches. The baked treats in the counter look delectable. I'll definitely be a regular here!",

I took my order to go, so I can't really say much on how the atmosphere really sets in but I'll have to sit and relax there when I can. Good coffee, pretty cool place, I'll be back.",

They only serve it in a large though so make sure you have a little room for an appetite as it does fill you up but it's a perfect breakfast for me to go with a side of fruit or an in between meal drink when I need a little boost.

And now I don't want to leave.  I know what you're thinking: \"If it's not crowded, it's not delicious, and if it's crowded, it must be great.\"  No.  It just means that most people are sheep [who enjoy burnt coffee].  I have been sitting here for the past two hours, and there has never been a moment at which every single table filled up.  That means I could have walked in at any moment and found a table.  I wasn't hungry yet, so I started out with an iced apricot (white) tea.  No sweetener, and it is superb.  I read some of the other reviews before I came, so I knew to order a large.  Smart move.  I got hungry a few minutes ago and ordered the Black Cat Melt (Smoked ham, provolone, Dijon mustard, red onion, grilled on marbled rye) with a side of fruit.  I apologize for not having taken a picture, but I was hooked at the first bite.  This is a thick-sliced rye, toasted to a warm-but-not-burnt perfection (how did they know I like my toast this way?!); the Dijon mustard is a delectable mustard, and there is just the right amount of ham and cheese--not so much that I feel gluttonous, but not so little that I feel deprived.  And there is a banana on my plate.  And it doesn't have any bruises.  I'm in heaven.  While I was waiting for my sandwich, I took my headphones off long enough to hear some of the employees talking to a very talkative little boy.  He was having a ball.  Anyone who can engage a small child and simultaneously make a sandwich this perfect has my vote.  I plan to be here for the rest of the afternoon.  And I'll definitely be back again...and again...and again.",

The few times I've been here since, I've taken a client here and been here with friends.  My time here with my client is what brings me back to update.  Sometime last year I brought a client here to enjoy coffee while her peers went out to see a movie.  Since this place has a huge window for a door, it was very easy to get in, which is saying something since she uses a wheelchair to get everywhere.  The baristas were very interactive with her and asked HER what SHE would like instead of looking at here chair and immediately asking me.  They gave her options for her coffee (light vs dark roast) and really listened to her.  They even told her their names when she asked.  I wasn't expecting much coming here, but the service she received was amazing.  Thank you so much for making her night.  Also, thanks for the sugar-free syrup options.  I hope Amaretto joins them, but for now, peanut butter will do.",

The only drawbacks is that their coffee sugar station didn't have any cream, it appears to be something you have to ask for. I suppose this is to prevent it from getting too warm.  Second is that they have 2 kinds of tables. Tiny ones that are more or less for one person and a couple of very large ones for 6 people or more. When me and my buddy wanted to pull out our laptops and get some work done, we couldn't fit at a small table (unless we each sat at different tables) so we decided to try one of the larger tables. The place was so busy that we felt awkward for using such a big table for just the two of us and we were getting a few snarky glances from other customers, so ultimately we just left.",

    "text": "Stumbled on this place after getting my fingerprints done next door. The garage door was open on this lovely spring day, and the big open hole in the shopping mall makes you go \"Oooh, what is THIS?\" and want to go inside, so in I went.  The mocha I got was amazing. The espresso has that nutty flavor and the chocolate was richer than most places. It was so good that I returned the next day... and the next day... at this point, I'm driving from Scottsdale out to Arcadia, bypassing at least 5 other coffee joints, just to go to Black Cat. It's that good.  On the subsequent visits, I got their toddy; WOW. I generally can't drink coffee with no sweetener, but this toddy was awesome. It wasn't bitter and was delicious with just a bit of milk. And the caffeine! I'm almost immune to caffeine at this point in my college career, but half of a large toddy kept me wide awake and productive from about 8pm untill after midnight. Schwing!  The atmosphere is really really cool; no hipster vibe at all, lots of young professionals working. They have dog water bowls outside, and yesterday there was a guy with his German Shepherd pup sound asleep on the floor next to him; it was adorable and so cool that they were allowed to sit just inside the garage door and nobody was spazzing out. There's art and music without being overpoweringly hipster snob. The staff are really sweet and laidback; the one guy says \"No worries!\" to everything.   They have a punch card deal too, and it's buy 9, get one free, not buy 10 like everywhere else. Winning!  The triple berry parfait I had yesterday afternoon is the only thing I'm knocking down stars on; it didn't feel as ice cold as a dairy product should, and that made me wonder if it had been kept at the \"safety zone\" temperature. The yogurt was kind of watery, not the thick consistency you'd expect, and some of the berries were mush essentially. It was delicious until about halfway through when it turned very acidic-tasting... and I got heartburn (which I NEVER get) after eating it.  I think I will stick to the very scrumptious-looking cakes and muffins from now on, because this parfait was iffy.",

They use locally roasted coffee (Passport) and locally baked pastries. A nice selection of teas as well, including Thai iced tea, which I don't often see on coffee shop menus.  Staff is very friendly, but they are still learning and there are some consistency issues. I like cappuccinos and no two people there seem to make them the same way. But their official Grand Opening isn't until Halloween, and it always takes new places a while to work out the kinks. Hoping for great things!",

Biscotti is from Bad Boy Biscotti in Gilbert.   Service was very friendly. The same person made my coffee drinks each time, and the quality was consistent.

So refreshing and lactose free. Healthy summer treat. The owner is there often and is a friendly local guy. The only annoyance is it's located just down the street from a high school. So don't hope for a quick drink right after school. Lots of high school kids ordering sugar filled frozen coffee drinks and with 1 or 2 people behind the counter, it could take 15 minutes to get anything more complicated than a regular coffee.

Also love the fact that they keep the doors open at night when the weather's nice so the restaurant is open to the breeze.  All they need is an actual pet cat to be the mascot of the store.  They'd get 100/5 stars from me for that.",

You never know what you have until you can compare it to something else -kind of like dumping the nice, smart guy to see what else is out there because you think the relationship is just \"good\", but maybe not good enough.  You start dating a hot badboy and well, you realize the grass is not always greener on the other side. So what if they got six pack abs?! They got nothing to stimulate you mentally. You'd rather just be looking at them instead of conversating with them.  ha.  Well, what I realized is Black Cat is the nice, smart guy that I left thinking there was something out there that is better.  My review before was me being a high-maintenance snot.  After two months of trying different coffee spots, I always seem to go back to Black Cat.  I will make the drive just to get the coffee (10 minutes).  It's insanely addicting and the flavor is ridicuously good.  I've compared Black Cat's coffee to at least 4 or 5 different places and Black Cat is always ranked number one.    Now that the weather is nice, they opened up the doors to make the shop look bigger and open.  I only wish Black Cat was closer to home or maybe I can just move so I am closer to Black Cat...OR maybe Black Cat and I can move in together.    Love you, Black Cat.",

They are very loud and trash the place and sometimes the mess sits for hours after the kids have left. Generally speaking the staff does nothing about it. They have a little sign on the wall that says \"seating for customers only\" but don't enforce it.   Outside of that annoying bit, I really like the place. Small and quiet with a great atmosphere. They offer great teas and coffee for a very reasonable price.",

The music they played was very relaxing indie style tunes, which complemented the studying well enough for me.  I also decided to order their Turkey Bacon Wrap with Granola and Yogurt for lunch when I got hungry. The wrap was cooked well and came with a hearty amout of eggs and tomatoes. The yogurt with granola was smooth and crunchy, just the way I like it. The meal portion was very fair for the relatively cheap price I paid.

She literally sighed and rolled her eyes.  Rumor is this small place is struggling,  now I know why.  I'll take my business next door or down the street, definitely not here where the coffee sucks AND the staff are rude.",

We waited over a half an hour for the girl behind the counter to make our breakfast sandwiches... she gave us our coffee on time but continued to serve people after us in line before completing our order... even when the shop cleared she just continued cleaning the bar and doing other tasks before even starting to make our sandwiches. We canceled our order and left. She came up with a lame excuse saying that the other worker didn't show up...doesn't mean you can't still complete our order. Because of this, we were late for work. This was completely unacceptable. Needless to say, we will never come back and give this company our business again.",

About a year ago, the original owner Don sold it to some guy who had no idea what he was doing, and now it's changed hands again...but this time, these new owners are taking great pride in Black Cat and to giving their customers supreme and speedy service with a smile!   Black Cat continues to be a phenomenal place to grab your favorite caffeinated beverage, and they also offer delicious snacks and savories. The zucchini bread is outstanding. Be sure to try their Thai iced tea (which you can get with non-fat milk instead of cream if you're watching your calories like me)...super yummy! Their hot chocolate is also to die for.   The new owners also do a fantastic job and keeping Black Cat clean and cozy. They've brought in some nice new art work to spruce up the surroundings.   Black Cat is still the best independent coffee establishment in the Valley. Be sure to check it out! :-)",

The staff here is friendly and the prices are actually pretty much on par w/the large chains, which isn't always the case w/small local places like this. I usually just pop in and out, but there's quite a few couches & tables, and it seems like a good place to hang out and get work done. They also do punch cards towards free drinks, which is always a good thing.",

    "text": "This is a coffee shop with character. The owner is kind, keeps a clean shop, and makes a bomb Thai Iced tea from scratch.   Location: Like most places in Arizona, this coffee shop is located in a strip mall. There's a Safeway in the mall and a few restaurants as well. It's a great area to run errands in.   Atmosphere: It's a little dark in here, but not so much that you can't get work done. I generally prefer light and airy spaces, but Black Cat offers a different and just as appreciated environment. It's cozy here, and makes me wish that Phoenix had more rain so that I could curl up in a seat with a hot cup of tea, and listen to the rain drops.   There are also paintings on the walls done by local artists. The owner brings in new work every few months to change the mood.   Seating: there are high tops, and many low tables to sit at. I would go with a huge group, but 4-6 people would sit comfortably.   Drinks: I ordered the Thai Iced Tea- I didn't want a pre-mixed overly sweet drink however, so the owner made mine from scratch at the same price. It was an absolute STEAL. The only thing I would've had differently was putting simple syrup in my drink instead of the honey. I hadn't realized that there was simple syrup at the back of the cafe. The drink itself was strong and flavorful - a favorite for sure. $3.50 for a large.   ALSO: taxes are included in the price. Love it.   Service: the owner is a sweetheart, and apparently his wife makes the best playlists.   I'll be back!",

I wouldn't have expected a cool coffee shop like this to be living in the Safeway shopping center, but it's a great fit! This coffee shop isn't big, but there's enough room to sit and do some work if you want. The menu is a good size for the coffee shop. They offer pastries, a hefty selection of coffee (including a tasty sounding Iced Toffee Mocha!), freshly made loose leaf hot or iced teas and even a couple meal options like a hefty salad or sandwich. I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu, but during my first visit, I enjoyed a refreshing (and quite large) iced tea. It was naturally sweetened and they have about 12+ flavors to choose from. I opted for a berry flavor which I liked. This is definitely a great spot to relax, work or have a meeting!",

    "text": "Arcadia needed this coffee house!  Hava Java married Coffee Bean!  First, let me admit that I drink a lot of coffee, specifically flavored lattes.  Daily, sometimes more than once a day, I will visit Starbucks, LGO, Hava Java, or Carmel's.  Black Cat is similar to Hava Java: large patio doors that open up during cooler weather, inviting interior with artwork, music playing, and cute baristas.  Black Cat has more seating than the closest Starbucks at 44th and Hava Java.  It's way quieter than LGO or Starbucks.  It has able wall outlets vs Hava Java.  It has two leather chairs!  Which, if they put 2 or 3 more sets (or leather love seats) where some of the bistro tables are, would make me rate this SIX STARS.  I give it four stars because it recently opened and this business could go to 5 or 3 over the next 6 to 9 months.  If they pull this Hava Java meets Coffee Bean off, it will compete with the best of them.  Yay!  I'm a fan.",

Recently, the service has gone way down hill.  I never know what I'm going to get or how long I will be there when I stop in. In September it took over 20 minutes to get a medium iced latte. In October I ordered an medium iced skinny vanilla latte, got the drink and it was super light so I double checked that it was skim milk and was assured that it was.  Turns out the reason my drink was so light is because there was no espresso in it!  Just skim milk and sugar free vanilla syrup, which was gross and disappointing. Today they completely forgot my drink!  I was trying to be patient... there were two drinks ahead of mine and when people that came in after me were getting their drinks, I asked about mine and they found it on the back counter.  I was so disappointed!  I really like the coffee but the service is really bad!!   The only time I'm guaranteed great service is when Ahmed is there.",

You order a bear claw and it's the size of your face!  and the breakfast sandwich is fresh made (they go make it) and ginormous (i eat half and am full!)     This place is tops!  Great food, friendly staff and awesome prices!    I recently moved from down the street to scottsdale (near buzzberry) and while i like buzzberry the prices can't compete (buzzberry 24 oz (large) is almost 7$ after tax! )  their yogurt cup is half the size but the same price.  Buzzberry is good and they serve lunch and dinner and are 24hrs with a drive thru but they are much more expensive!  I still drive to black cat whenever time permits!  :-)",

Hot fresh brewed tea that tastes amazing on a breezy evening at a cute tea shop with great music softly playing in the background is soooo good in my soul.  The man friend also loved the breakfast sandwich! I could be here for hours! Definitely coming back soon!!!",

    "text": "I really dislike giving anything lower than 3 stars but I feel I need to address today's experience... I like coming to Black Cat Coffee House for the ambience, the thai iced tea, and the internet when I need it...  I have been here several times and have had enjoyable experiences However, today I walked in and found a seat near the coffee bar... I had some work to do and I got some water... I didn't plan on getting coffee or something to drink for a while, as I had drank so much coffee in the morning... The workers were nice and asked if I wanted anything, I politely told them that I was going to have water for now but then eventually get something a bit later... I sat down for about 10 minutes when another man came in, not sure if he is the manager or owner...  He came over and checked on me to see if I needed anything... At first, I thought he was being polite and exhibiting exceptional customer service, but really he was trying to make me buy something... a drink or anything... I get that I am here using the WIFI, but I recently told the workers that I was going to buy something eventually.... and as a regular, I feel a little uneasy about being forced to purchase something just to use the WIFI... I get it, as a small local business, you WIFI is not free and people shouldn't come in to just use it... So I am not sure if they get a lot of people who just come in for WIFI, but there are also signs that sort of say WIFI is for paying customers... So I think I got the memo... After this exchange I just feel a little weird and now I feel really pressured into buying something... As a small business owner, I think you live and die off of customer service and although I may be only one person, it just sort of rubbed me in the wrong way...  I will continue coming to Black Cat and hoping that I don't get pressured into buying something as soon as I walk through the doors... I do have the memo that WIFI is not free, so maybe next time I will just buy something and throw it away... just to make it clear that I am making a purchase...   3 stars is not bad, but I will give it a couple of more trys, which could lead to an updated higher review...  I guess it's time for me to get up and buy a Thai Iced Tea...",

However, the espresso in my caffe macchiato (called an espresso macchiato on the menu) was awful - very sour and medicinal tasting. I'm not sure if it was a specific roast or if it was because we went late at night (nearly 9pm) but it was simply not good. I'd have to try it mixed in a drink but nearly plain, it was undrinkable. I had to force it down just to not feel like I was wasting.",

When I got home and had my bran muffin, it was to die for. Moist, lots of bran texture, and a nice glaze on it. In addition, it was huge, so I got to have the rest the next day!",

    "text": "I was in the Safeway parking lot near this place and needed a cup of coffee. Instead of the run-of-the-mill Starbucks stop,  I wanted to hit up a local place.   As soon as I got in, I immediately liked the atmosphere. It's a nice, cozy little place. There was local art hanging on the walls. The place had some indie-rock over head which I liked too.  Whenever I go into a locally owned coffee shop, I've come to expect a stuffy, pretentious, hipster-like aura (i.e., LUX on Central Ave and Campbell), but this place was very inviting.   About a month ago I changed my diet to not include any flour, dairy or radically processed foods.   This meant that I had to say no to lattes and only drink black coffee. I'm allergic to almond and soy products, so I can't drink almond or soy milk lattes.  That's why I was  very glad  to see they offered rice milk lattes at a reasonable price! I'm glad I stopped here, because at any other coffee place I'd have to just drink black coffee. I was also very good.  They also had some pretty good looking treats on display, but sadly I couldn't eat any of it.   The staff was pretty nice too. I'd definitely come back to this place!",

    "text": "Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination.  This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother.  Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.)  Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right!",

Great little coffee shop to sit back and kill some time.  They have a great menu for both coffee and eats.  I have not tried a pastry but they look amazing.  The coffee has a great smooth, flavor.  The vibe is pretty laid-back and they have TVs to offer some entertainment.  I love that they offer punch cards...not a lot of places do that.",
