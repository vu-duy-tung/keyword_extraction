It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance.  They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs.  Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect.  We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm.",

Our shrimp risotto was more like shrimp and wild rice and the linguini pesto chicken needed salt to bring out the flavor and I never salt my food. Disappointing food in both our meals. Maybe other dishes are better but it will be a long time before we go again to find out. Save your money, there are several better choices within walking distance.",

We each tried a different dish while sharing a bottle of Barbara red wine. Dishes we ordered were a Cesar salad, bolonese, linguine pescatore, penne vodka---all great Italian food!  Deserts were homemade cheesecake, flour less cake and tiramisu that we ordered. Sitting in the bar area at a table was great atmosphere for our ladies laughing and telling stories. The chef stopped by our table and even stayed to chat with us. We had a great time and will be back again!",

Had to ask multiple times for the parmesan cheese which, when finally brought out, was in a grinder that kept breaking on the waiter. At the completion of the meal that waiter asked, \"done yet\"? How about, \"ma'm are you finished yet\"?  The olive oil was rancid.   For the price of lunch ($74 for two), will not be back.",

My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from.   The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive.  There are a lot of American wines Two of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy.  Wife and I  split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it.  This is not an inexpensive lunch but the prices were not unreasonably high.",

Had more than enough to take home for another meal.   My wife had the eggplant lasagna. Very good.   Had the cannoli for dessert. Probably the best I've ever eaten.   Why only four stars?  The waiter was completely disinterested. He came over and asked if we were ready to order. When we hesitated for a couple of seconds, he immediately said he'd come back later. Really?  After our meal was served, he never returned to ask how our meal was. Or to refill our water glass.   Now, this wasn't some college student. It was apparent he was one of the managers as he was dressed in a sleeves rolled up shirt and slacks.   We would go back again as this is one of the few restaurants in the Phoenix area that knows how to cook real Italian food that's also delicious and plentiful.",

We sat out on the patio after being immediately greeted and welcomed and given a choice of sitting in the restaurant or outside.  There is a nice mix of bar seating, dining room and patio.  We went on a Wednesday night in March so it wasn't overly busy.  The patio was nice and cozy and had good furniture and heat lamps incase.    The waiter we had was named Stallone.  He was great.  Very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were long lost customers he hadn't seen in ages.  We also met the restaurant owner Dave who was great.  There was a medical incident in the restaurant while we were there and the staff handled the first responders and customer with attentiveness, class and dignity.  We mentioned to Dave that we heard the cannoli was recommended but overpriced according to some other Yelp reviews so he brought us one on the house.  Dish portions were large and we couldn't finish what we had ordered.  Great night.  One star was lost because of the location.  Plaza is a bit sketchy looking and not in the most vibrant part of Scottsdale although it's been in that location for 20+ years which means they are doing something right",

The way he treated my friends and I was nothing short of amazing. His recommendations of appetizers and entrees was beyond helpful. He even offered some family style pasta and that is a tradition in Rhode Island. Even though we did not take that suggestion it just really made our night. Every dish I have had here is wonderful. I've had the best calamari here, chicken & eggplant parmigiana, mushroom ravioli etc. You can also tell that the pasta is homemade and that is what they are known for. I enjoy that this restaurant is not loud as well. The waiters always take notice of drinks and you do not have to ask them continuously to refill them. It's always a place I will keep coming back to.",

But last night my boyfriend and I wanted to do a low key date night and I was craving Italian that wasn't going to break the bank. I think I can speak for both of us when I say we made a great choice in choosing Pasta Brioni.   We ate on the lounge side which is very casual and low key. the vibe is like an old school Italian place- Sinatra playing and all. The food, as I expected, was delicious, but more importantly the service was top notch. Our server Brian was really awesome! Prompt, friendly and funny.   I'm honestly surprised that anyone would give this place less than 5 stars.... But oh well, more pasta for me because we will definitely be back!!",

Finally, my husband said 'hellooooo' and suddenly a girl popped up from a booth in the rear of the room! She said 'oh- sorry- I was just resting because I'm not used to working days and I was so bored'... Need I continue? She was also our server.

This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best.  This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved.  We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal.  At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill.  When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word.  Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work.  I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place.  I prefer my pasta without the uppity Scottsdale attitude.",

The cons were the portion sizes were massive.  I know in the Italian culture pasta is served in big portions, but I took half of the dish home, and pasta the next day is just not the same.  Since the prices are high and you get what you pay for, I'd rather have a smaller portion with a lower price.  I ordered what I believed to be a side ceaser salad.  That was also huge, seemed like a whole head of lettuce.  It was very tasty, maybe a bit to much dressing that caused it to be not crispy.  It was also disappointing the server didn't offer to crack pepper on the salad and pasta, and offer grated cheese on the pasta.  To be honest, I would have been happy with the bread and salad and I would have been full for 6.50.  Yes, the side salad was 6.50, that was a bit ridiculous.  I had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well.  So I think lowering the prices and the amount of food they give you can set this place over the top.",

They even had their own calendar for a couple years!  Sadly, on a recent birthday outing with 4 other girls, we were disappointed to find that the hot young boys were nowhere in sight (no offense to the fine waiters that do work there).  That's the real reason we chose Brioni's, as there are other places to get good Italian food if that's what you're after.  Granted, it may be that the boys had the night off for their other job with the Chippendales, but I doubt it.   We were there on a Friday night, and they seated us in a room I didn't know existed (the place is huge, with several rooms), not in the bar area where I'd had good times in the past.  The service was good, although the corner where we were seated smelled like old wood...?  It seems the crowd here has aged a bit as well..not that there's anything wrong with that...but it was more of the close to retirement set, rather than hot middle-agers like us!  Bottom line: still great food, good place to take visiting family around the holidays, but unfortunately the man candy is gone...",

    "text": "I went here last night despite quite a few yelpers giving it a thumbs  down. But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the \"other side\" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the \"to go\" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question.",

    "text": "Pasta Brioni was one of the first restaurants I tried out when I moved to the valley last year.  The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!",

Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients.  The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness.  Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree.  This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp.  Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list.  It was very disappointing.",

She was attentive but never hovered. Moved into the diningroom for dinner. The ambiance was old school, white tablecloths, dark wood and leather. It felt cozy and classy. We thought perhaps a Soprano or two might show up!! Could this really be in a strip mall instead of NYC or SF? Two of us ordered the same dish. Two of us different dishes. We were all thrilled with rich flavors and portions. Our waiter was service at its best. He recited multiple dinner specials without a hitch, listened to us, engaged us, charmed us and was set on making this our best memory. He went over and above to fulfill a request for dessert.  FINALLY the Italian restaurant we have searched the valley to find....we want to tell the world AND we want to keep it to ourselves....but that would really be selfish! Wonderful place to go with friends and share a memorable evening.....ambiance. food. wine. SERVICE. Go! (Probably great grown up date night, too. You can hear one another!!)",

    "text": "I'm not sure I will ever go back. Went to Pasta Brioni with my mom on Friday and after we were seated our server came over and said, \"Well let's get this show on the road.\" I guess the restaurant was expecting a large party so they didn't want to work before the party arrived. Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said \"Nahhhhhh\" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for  $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you.",

    "text": "I like Brioni's.  The Happy Hour specials are a steal.  The ambiance is usually very good.  I like the old school formal wooden decor.  The food is anywhere from good to outstanding depending on the item.  In general, they follow the Italian tradition of choosing the best ingredients, instead of gimmicky crap.  I really like the mussels with the marachiara sauce.  That (clear tomato with garlic) sauce is worth a trip.  The calamari salad is also a wonderful and healthy choice.  Split that with a friend at happy hour followed by a pasta dish and you're eating like a king for nothin'.  I've had 4 or 5 pasta dishes that were all great.  Today, I had the chicken sorrentino which was very good.  However, I did have one bad experience that I'd like to share for the purpose of entertaining Yelpers and perhaps fixing the issue at a restaurant I enjoy eating at.  If you're about to eat, you might want to stop reading.    - I ordered my food.  It was a later in the lunch hour and pretty empty. - I went to the bathroom. - After going, I saw there was NO toilet paper.  This is pretty bad for an upscale restaurant, but whatever.  Call it an oversight. - So, I called the restaurant from my cell phone and explained that I was in the bathroom in need of toilet paper. - No one ever came.  I gave up because I was in a hurry during the work day. - After eating, I checked the bathroom again.  Still, no toilet paper.  I know this is a weird situation and I've eaten here about six times with no similar issues.  I was too bashful to bring it up again in person and there was no feedback link on their web site.  So, I'm hoping someone will read this review at the restaurant and fix the issue so that it does not happen again.",

I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters.  What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was. My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk. My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven.  I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good.  After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert.  Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway.  Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.  Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief.",

Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said \"Nope, can't do it we have people outside.\" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids.",

We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too.  Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu \"along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu.\" ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay.  It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal.  Oh, my date had that lasagna and I didn't try it, but was told \"Fine.\" when asked how it was, and he was actually talking about the food (and not some I'm-mad-at-you-but-not-telling-you boyspeak). It looked like it had cheese on top. No shit, it's lasagna. Not a good descriptor, I know.",

I've been avoiding going because I tend to trust Yelpers but I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday and there were three of us. I tend to stay away from \"suggestions\" or \"specials\" bu the waiter did a great job of going over them and not being pushy. To start with the negatives, I'd say that my restaurant experiences (French,Italian or otherwise at least in Europe) begin with a few rolls of bread in a basket at your table and some butter (or olive oil). They weren't far off providing one roll and your customary olive oil but with a twist in that the bottle had an opening for balsamic vinegar which made for a great blend. I had the spinach and ricotta dumplings and the waiter was kind enough to suggest having it served with the vodka cream sauce. A great choice. My two friends had the capellini primavera (which I helped finish and it was delicious) and the chicken picatta (which I did not taste but looked equally good). All that capped with a bottle of Chianit and it was a great start to our Saturday night. I'd probably recommend it for a date or with family  or a large group but definitely not for parents with young children as it wasn't necessarily the most casual place to dine.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch & First off, it wasn't very busy around 2PM which was nice. The bread is freaking amazing. One of the bests I've had at a family style italian restaurant-then they have rosemary butter which really set it off. I wasn't disappointed with any service or the food. I got the beet salad, fig bruschetta & 4 cheese rigatoni. My mother got the mushroom ravioli. Every meal was exceptional to me. If you're looking for a filling comfort Italian meal this place is it. I'm not certain if it's fortunate or unfortunate that it is conveniently a mile away. I'm sure by the end of the year I'll have tried to whole menu. Also-brought the boyfriend the leftovers & the first bite he took he damn near died. You can really taste the authenticity & freshness of the food, it is most definitely homemade.",

My parents health has been declining so we can't visit as much as we'd like. This brings me to my recent to the take outside! My mother and father were both in the hospital. My mother wanted her favorite meal which was Chicken Martini with extra asparagus. The kitchen for that order was not open, separate kitchens and different menus, I should have known, at that point I was beyond exhausted. Kristen is her name, she made it happen, she said I can do this for you! I can't promise next time when that kitchen is not open. Kristen chatted with me, for quite sometime. She even bought me a glass of wine, she's comforted me as I couldn't hold my damn ugly crying face together. I could tell she genuinely cares and she's there and cares more than a paycheck. This is my first review ever, but she needs praised! She not only talked me down off the bridge ( joking, my humor sucks ) but what a kind human you are. I will be back to visit her! Y'all should go visit Kristen and give her a big hug from me!",

It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye.  Seriously guys.!!  Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good.  I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here.  The only good thing was the can of coke!",

It may not be the fanciest or most romantic place from a decor & lighting perspective, but the food is amazing and reasonably priced.  I did wish they had a bit more selection on the wine list but that's really a minor complaint.  I loved my eggplant and my man loved his shrimp scampi pasta. And we BOTH loved the yummy fresh bread.

The dim lighting sets the right mood for drinks and food. For dinner I got the salmon with a glass of white wine. The salmon was very delicious. It was perfectly cooked and marinated.

I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy.  Even the beet salad was terrible.  How do mess that up, try Terrible dressing, bitter lettuce.  Some sort of beet that tasted sour and old.  We will not be back. Again I wonder where the owner is and if he eats there.",

The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.",

    "text": "A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds.    Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes.   Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite.   The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill.   We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!",

Once engaging with Dave the manager it was very easy to select the menu and other items we wanted. The dining room was reserved for us and everything was just prefect. We were entertaining mostly people from New York and I wondered how the picky New Yorkers would react to AZ Italian. Everyone loved the food and committed on the excellent service. We could not of selected a better venue for a event like this. I am a \"chicken parmigiana\" freak and I have to say it's the best I have ever had.

The chicken parm for one can feed at least 3 reasonably hungry adults, ok maybe not quite 3 but it's really really huge. Huge and DELICIOUS.  Other dishes were great too and the experience was made all the better by the classic Italian ambiance of dark wood and white table cloths and read leather booths with old photos and posters. Very charming and casual but still upscale spot overall. Great for family dinner.  Excited to come back soon!",

Another thing that is to die for is their Caesar salad! It comes in large portions though, so be prepared to really eat up! For dessert, the cannolis are really and truly amazing.

    "text": "4416 N Miller Rd Scottsdale, AZ 85251  Companion and I visited this restaurant during Arizona Restaurant Week. Pasta Brioni has been in business for many years, and has had a good reputation.  We started out with an appetizer of Calamari Fritti. The calamari was properly fried and was nice and tender, though the marinara sauce was a bit watery and lacking in tomato taste. Rolls were also brought out and were served with a compound butter made with sweet butter.  Next were our salads. We both ordered the Caprese Salad, which had nice pieces of mozzarella, thick slices of tomato, and balsamic vinaigrette along with a chiffonade of basil.  For the main course, companion ordered lobster ravioli and I ordered linguini pescatore. This is where we ran into problems. The ravioli was much more al dente than it should have been, though the flavor was fine.  The linguini was actually under cooked thought the seafood in it was definitely over cooked. The other problem was that the sauce was thin and watery with virtually no tomato flavor. I don't like to post about problems with food, but this was definitely in need of help and was not finished by me.   Dessert was Mascarpone Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Cake. Once again, I got the short end of the stick. The cheesecake had a funny flavor that I did not care for. The chocolate cake was like a big slice of chocolate fudge and is to be recommended.  Service was good as was cleanliness.  Overall, this meal was a disappointment. I can only hope that it was this meal and not a regular meal of the restaurant.  3 stars",

We had the linguini pescadore, spaghetti and meatballs, and eggplant little plate.  Marinara is very rich and was in both the spaghetti and eggplant.  Pescadore was good but not very much seafood flavor in the broth.  And the rolls were fresh and dense, but could definitely have used some more garlic them.  I also didn't understand the honey butter on the table.  Way too American for a lovely little Italian themed restaurant like this one.  My first post was removed because I named my favorite Hill Country Italian restaurant so I'm hoping this one makes it past the censors.

    "text": "Went here on Valentine's Day and was highly satisfied with the whole experience! There are two sections to the establishment with separate entrances. One side is more casual dining cafe with a smaller menu (mostly pizza) and the other side is a more upscale restaurant with a wider variety of entree options.  We ordered the linguine pescatore, shrimp and sausage linguine in Parmesan cream sauce, and the mussels as an appetizer. Everything was delicious and not a bad price at all for the amount and quality of food! Will definitely be back!",

Our host (unfortunately we didnt get his name right, he was a tall young man and he seemed to have a sort of european name) was very nice to us and showed interest in making sure we were having a good time.   Everything we had was perfectly cooked and the ambient was very calm and comforting. They have the best butter I have ever had in my entire life! Their Tiramisu was also the best dessert I have had in years.  Please give this place a try with your significant other, you will both have a great time, and remember to try their butter!",

    "text": "Where do I begin on this crap fest?  I read some of the other reviews to this place and it's about the same poop, but a different day.  My wife comes from a large Italian family.  We know our Italian.  This my friend is NOT Italian.  The decor was nice, but almost every Italian joint has nice decor.  The menu looked great.  We were so excited.  My wife and I were STARVING when we got in.  We were happy we got seated right away.  They brought out fresh rolls right away and they were delicious.  It's the only reason this place is getting their 1 star. We got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting.  I took a bite and couldn't eat anymore.  My wife was so hungry, she ate it all.  She didn't care.  She thought it was gross too.  The breading was finely grated and seemed like it was cooked in very old oil.  It smelled and tasted like yesterday's oil.  It made me pretty sick.  I got Salmon and my wife got breaded chicken.  My salmon was smelly (very fishy) and overcooked.  Like a hockey puck.  The sauce on the pasta was exactly the sauce that came with the calamari, though our server insisted it was different.  My wife's chicken was topped with melted butter.  I am not sure what the sauce was supposed to be, but it was breaded chicken with melted butter.  Needless to say, we took one bite, sent it back and got our bill.  The interesting thing was our server was not suprised in the least bit.  We ordered what we ordered because our server suggested it.  He didn't ask why we were sending it back.  It was almost like this has already happened a few times so far this evening.    Overall, AVOID AT ALL COST.  The place is not cheap and you are not getting your money's worth.",

Most of them must be off on Sunday night, although we did see an old dude walking around in a tie-I assume he was the manager-that or  I've got a seriously different definition of hot than the average girl.  This was our first time here, and we were not disappointed.  We had an appetizer of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto.  Perfect with the warm rolls they serve.  My husband and I both had pasta dishes-mine was good ole' spaghetti and meatballs, and those balls were big!  We're talking about the food now, not the waiters, so keep up.  My husband had linguine with crab meat.  We both thought our dishes were excellent as well as the tiramisu we shared.  Service was excellent.  I like how they brought a board out with all the specials on it and left it at the table to check out, rather than rattling off the options, most of which you will forget by the time they're done reciting them.  I knock a star off as I thought the pasta dishes were overpriced.  $14 for the spaghetti and $23 for the linguine with crab-it wasn't like there was a pound of crab meat in it!  But overall, a great meal.  We'll definitely come again.",

I do think they only hire people from New York or Jersey... the servers have the all the attitude that you would expect out of a Sopranos episode...  the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in the Bronx despite being in a strip mall...  But by far the best thing this place has to offer is the food.  while the menu is not too large and surprisingly does not have alot of Italian dishes most things they will make for you... for example last time i was there they made chicken parmesan... i would go out on a limb and say that if it is not on the menu they will probably make it for you... especially if you are a female!    this is tops in the valley for the real deal itilano place that makes you feel like you are on the east coast",

    "text": "Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni.   I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited.   The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.  We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice.   For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.  My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast!   My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular.   Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful.   Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.",

The environment was beautiful as we were seated outside (thanks to the beautiful Arizona weather). Our waiter was very friendly. He was very helpful and made pleasant conversation. Many of the staff was interactive with the people and seemed to legitimately have fun in doing their job. The food was just as amazing as the service. I got the penne vodka with chicken and a garden salad. She got the rigatoni pasta with meatballs and a Ceasar salad. AMAZING. Paid 65 including a 15 dollar tip. Overall they helped make our Valentine's day experience amazing and this business deserved all the credit in the world for their amazing food and professionalism. I am a huge fan.

We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Martini as entrees, which I think are some of the best in town without a doubt.  I was so eager to dive in that I forgot to take a picture.  We'll definitely be coming back again soon - more than once.",

    "text": "UNREMARKABLE is the best rating I can offer. while it has been a few years since I last visited, I had been anticipating a some what better of a dinning experience. It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than \"please follow me\". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When  I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning.  I followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room,  he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took  a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred.  By the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated.  JC",

It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order.  I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home.  Pricing is okay.  Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I).    I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been looking for a good Italian place in the area for some time. Another couple took us to dinner at Pasta Brioni. They've been going there for years and raved about the place..  The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking.  Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal.   The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese.  The dish was very good and had lots of food.   After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side.  Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening.   Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner.  I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes..",

This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do.  Many thanks and kudos!",

We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar.  A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!",

Dessert was kinda meh (though I ate it anyway - it's rude to wrap with Italians), but they have a decent wine list, so eat up, and skip dessert.  98% of the all-male staff are exceptionally hot, btw (there might have been women working there, but I didn't notice in the sea of tall, dark and handsome and dressed in black).  Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone.  I was tempted to write my number on a few bev naps and pass them around to anyone who eye fucked me longer than 10 seconds.  I'd recommend not taking a date you're pretty into just for this reason (lesson learned - lol).",

I have been here once last year, and once the following year. Both times I had a fantastic experience. I sat at the bar because I was by myself, the bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, very friendly very personable, I appreciated that.  He brought out some bread which was by itself delicious, but the real showstopper was the butter, which was in a wheel form with honey, garlic, and all kinds of excellent things. And I cannot tell you how good it was. I had the mussels which were perfect and followed  by the pumpkin ravioli. be Forget browned butter, corn is where it's at ans the corn was absolutely fantastic on the first bite. I can't tell you what all was in it because I was too happy and enjoying the taste of it in my mouth.   I decided to be smart and take the rest of it home with me and asked if I could have some bread and butter and this is not your normal bread and butter and he delivered, the bartender gave me a massive loaf to take with me plus that fantastic honey garlic butter to go with.  I have been to Arizona twice in my life once last year, and once this year and I have had dinner here but times and not been disappointed. I will be here next year at the same time, and I fully intend to come back and if you don't you're doing yourself a disservice.",

    "text": "What I love about Pasta Brioni is the the fast-casual option on the east side of the building. On that side of the restaurant you can get high quality food without the frills of a nice Italian restaurant (which you get with the main restaurant).  I really love the vodka penne pasta, their vodka sauce is absolutely great. The cheese garlic bread is also very good. They also make a really good NY style pizza.  If you're looking for a quick option, with great food come here and go to the to-go side. You won't regret it.",

We enjoyed drinks at the bar, and were pleasantly surprised to find they had blue cheese stuffed olives (a rarity at most Italian places). The bartender was great, and when it came time to be seated she actually walked us to the dining room.   Once seated in our booth, our waiter was quick to greet us and refill our drinks. He was the perfect blend of professional and friendly, and had recommendations whenever we asked. He went out of his way to ensure we were happy, including making a special dish upon request without any hesitation, and offering my friend the option to have a mushroom ravioli as a side so she could try the chicken dish she was eyeing.   Delicious food, charming dining room, and the best service we have had in a long time, make this a place we will definitely return to.",

Their Caesar dressing doesn't taste fishy at all and makes for a great side salad. It's a little pricey, but worth it because they give a huge portion so I always have leftovers.",

It has been in the Valley FOREVER and most often my family gets takeout but I have to say, dining in is a super fab experience.   They bring you warm, doughy rolls to start that are absolutely delicious. The best part, they have EVOO + Balsamic on the tables so that you can dip your bread! {my guilty pleasure} We split a bottle of delicious Chianti and then for my meal, I ordered a garden salad with their homemade Italian dressing {so yum!} and the piccata but subbed chicken for veal. It was SO tasty. I got it with a side of spaghetti that was just pretty average, I thought the noodles were a tad overdone but that is my only sorta complaint. All in all, I left SO full and ready for bed! Did someone say food coma?   I would totally recommend Pasta Brioni for a family dinner, birthday, catering, you name it! They are also known for their cute Italian servers! ;)",

After being seated, waters and bread were served immediately. They took our order, we both ordered a pasta entree and decided to split a salad. The salad showed up within 2 minutes and I know they were making them fresh, as we saw them making them while we were waiting for our seat.   My girlfriend had spaghetti and meatballs, I had four cheese rigatoni. The spaghetti was the homemade fatter noodle. It was so good, and the meatballs were to die for.   The four cheese rigatoni was piping hot, perfect consistency and very good.   No less than 4 staff checked in on us throughout the meal, the hostess, the manager, a server and a busboy.   We really enjoyed the experience. We'll be back again soon, but it may also become a new annual Christmas tradition.",

It's a fun girls night out, but it's also great for date night or with a group.  Most recently, I went with a group of 8 of us on a Saturday night.  It was a spontaneous decision that the birthday girl (Halley S) made with some persuasion from her fiance and my boyfriend too.  (I think they really wanted Italian food).  Luckily, Brioni accommodated us and we were seated within minutes of arriving.  The ownership may have changed, and maybe the waiters weren't as HOT as i remembered, but we were all pleased with our experience.  Justin was our waiter and he put up with some random questions from my boyfriend (IE - are all Maryland Crab Cakes from Maryland?) - he'd been drinking all day long; forgive him!  The warm rolls were as good as ever and we were all happy that there was plenty of olive oil, parmesan, and balsamic on the table ready and waiting for us to dip into!  I started with a dirty Grey Goose martini and it went down real easy... The birthday girl and some of the other girls seemed to enjoy their blueberry lemon drop martinis also.  Some of us had wine with dinner and that was good too...   Onto the food - I had a few bites of the artichoke appetizer (note that it's served cold, but it's tasty!)  For my entree, I went with the tilapia special of the day - it was a huge portion and it was great; served with veggies but I had a side of pasta too (after all, we were at PASTA Brioni!)  Others in the group had the grilled salmon special, mushroom ravioli, gnocchi, chicken martini (this is a special recipe that is really good) and maybe chicken parmesan.  No complaints from anyone - pretty cool!  We didn't order dessert since we had Sprinkles cupcakes... it was really sweet that our waiter even served them for us - not all restaurants are so accommodating when you bring in outside food).  All that and total per person (of course we all paid for the birthday girl too) was $48 including 20% tip.  Not bad for a Saturday night out for a special occasion!  We are excited to be moving back into the Old Town 'hood - I'm sure we'll make Pasta Brioni one of our regular stops on the restaurant rotation... maybe we'll see you there?!",

Husband said his chicken parm was just okay; friend's spaghetti and meatballs same thing -- just okay.  My salmon was a bit on the fishy side and I was uber thirsty the entire night.   Actually had to get up out of bed for water during the night.   Seemed pricey for what we got ($40/per person) - with 1 drink each.   Probably won't go back.   Have since heard that ownership has changed and really -- it wasn't worth the drive from Surprise.   Sorry.",

    "text": "There's just something about Sunday night and pasta. It goes together like... tomatoes and mozzarella? Last night, I made my way to this neighborhood pasta shop for a family dinner. My meal was spectacular. I ordered the Linguini with seafood and I'm pretty sure the entire ocean was on my plate...in a good way. They brought out the plate of Linguini with all the seafood toppings including squid, shrimp, oysters, clams and probably some fish I couldn't even name for you. At any rate, it was delish! The pasta sauce complimented the fish perfectly and I found myself eating much more of it than I should have.   So speaking of seafood, Pasta Brioni accidentally must have merged with a sushi joint last night and they accidentally brought my Mom her halibut more on the \"still swimming\" side of the plate rather than cooked. When we brought it to the server's attention he was mortified and I will say this... Because of how apologetic the server was, how they handled the situation and how accommodating they were with their mistake, I don't see a reason to have the experience alter my impression of Pasta Brioni. They brought my Mom out a new meal in record time and we were well on our way, after delicious Tiramisu and some chocolate mousse plate of goodness of course!  In summary, sometimes it's entirely about how a restaurant handles unfortunate situations. It seemed like the kitchen just had a \"whoops\" moment and that happens to the best of us, so for that I give them a get out of jail free card. Other restaurants should follow their customer service lead! Plus, I think I might have been in my own food coma of happiness from my own meal. Is it bad that I couldn't wait for my Mom to get her replacement meal and instead scarfed down my personal ocean on a plate? I did give her a little taste as she waited for her own.",

Hopefully, it was just a bad night in the kitchen  Sadly, this place has officially died in my mind after the junk they served us on Sunday. Of course, the prices keep going up ($12 for each sandwich). Not sure if they changed cooks, managers or owners, but those beautiful chicken cutlets I have enjoyed for years have been replaced by sliced pieces of burnt breaded chicken. It is something that you might receive from one of those tourist trap places at midnight near an amusement park. The pasta salad served with both Grinders (as they call them now) looked and tasted differently as well.    The chipotle chicken wrap was a complete disaster. It contained a head of lettuce and looked nothing like the 20 others we have ordered in the past. Plus they forgot the sauce on the side which didn't matter because the food was horrible.  Also, the only place that can officially call a sandwich a grinder is in Connecticut.",

Tonight we decided to get there in time for happy hour. We sat at the bar which I actually liked and enjoyed the apps and wine specials offered. Happy hour ends at 6pm but Sun through Wednesday it goes until 845!  Definitely take advantage of the app specials.  We had the \"wine of the moment\" which was an Italian Bolla. Very good. For apps we had the Caprese and the Bruschetta board.  I could have done without the bread and would have loved a charcuterie board instead.   For dinner we had the Chicken Parm--(outstandingly!!) and the shrimp Vesuvius (also outstanding).  Love the food and so far the best for those that miss the Italian restaurants in the northeast.",

The bartender was only interested in speaking with the other couple at the bar. She took my vodka soda away and I was not even done and she didn't even ask if I wanted a second one, which I did. She struggled to fill our waters as I sat there with an empty water the entire meal. The kicker at the end was when my friend and I were both getting our cards out to split the check and she grabbed his and walked away and ran his card. Maybe she was having a bad night but disappointed to say the least. I hope it was just an off night because it was terrible service!",

    "text": "Great food, excellent service and a warm inviting ambiance makes this an easy choice for a good meal any day of the week. Prices are not low but Happy Hour at the bar rail does offer some financial relief with tasty, slightly lower priced apps, wine and cocktails.  On this visit we split a chopped salad which they actually split it in the kitchen which was nice. Shaved carrots on top of a crisp blend of mixed greens, some giardiniera and thin strips of prosciutto. Small chunks of feta(?) and a nicely balanced vinaigrette came together for a well composed salad. My better half had the mushroom ravioli and they were chock full of fresh mushroom and not that unidentifiable gray mass you usually find in other mushroom ravioli. The dough was light and thin. The only two little problems we had with these were that they contained shitake mushooms (which for some reason the chef seems to use a lot on the menu, but shitakes are very particular in their flavor and a little chewy so I do not care for them in a delicate dish like this because they overpower with their flavor) and the dish was also not hot enough especially the outer ring of ravioli. Probably this dish was made first and then sitting waiting for my dish - the Chicken Martini. The Chicken Martini was AMAZING. If you have ever had a lacy egg wash coated sauteed chicken cutlet before and liked that you need to order this. The whole plate (7 to 8\" wide) was covered with the super tender pounded chicken breast coated in the thin, lacy coating of egg and flour and topped with a white wine butter sauce and some roasted asparagus.  It was so good I hated to offer some to my hubby for fear he would then not like his dish. We split a freshly filled cannolo (a singular piece ends in o, multiple cannolo = cannoli!) for dessert and we were not disappointed. Creamy and sweet ricotta filling with lots of chocolate chips.  William our server was professional, friendly and attentive, but not overly so.",

    "text": "Five of us had a really nice Monday lunch here, and practically had the place to ourselves, maybe because it's an all day menu?  Didn't see any lunch specials, but it didn't matter to us because we were looking for the main meal of our vacation day.  Note:  the bar side is open at lunch time.  If you come in the other side and see that it looks deserted like we did, just walk on through to the other side.  First, I have to say that the fresh warm rolls with a garlic herb butter are outstanding!  Especially paired with the house Chianti.  Yum!  Between the five of us we tried the Wedding Soup, the Eggplant Rollatini, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Chicken Parmesan (which also came with a salad and spaghetti), and Eggplant Parmesan (which came with spaghetti).  All of us were very happy with our meals!  Note:  the spaghetti is house made!  Everything is.  Even the wedding soup. I loved my eggplant parmesan as it was shaved eggplant, not breaded.  Lighter but with a good amount of cheesiness.   Portions are incredibly generous, which made for some sad waste, as we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room.  Ambiance has a dark old-school feel, which was just right for our purposes.    Note:  Location is in the Old Town/Downtown Scottsdale area.  In a strip shopping center, quite close to the Aloft Hotel where we were staying.  Can definitely recommend it!",

I love Pasta Brioni for the ambiance of the dining room, a wonderful evening of fine Italian cuisine and the attentiveness of the servers. I feel that the bar side of the restaurant is more appropriate when dressed casually, but it's also very nice with warm dark wood and an intimate mood, as you can see in my photo.  They do take, and I definitely recommend, reservations, however we went on a Wednesday night, and they were able to squeeze our party of 5 into the casual side, and we also had the option of eating outside. No matter how busy they are, the waiters are always at ease and make you feel like you are their priority...the \"Italian way.\"  The pasta is made fresh daily, and the entree portions are large. (See my photo of Chicken Parmesan with a side of pasta; that's HALF of an order, and they were HAPPY to split the order for us.) The Cannoli and Tiramisu are 100% authentic and amazing. I most definitely recommend the Tiramisu, especially since you can't get it this authentic at most other Italian restaurants.   They also cater. I have no idea why I didn't think of them when we catered our last party. I'm obviously going to use them next time.  (They also have \"Brioni To Go\" next door with pizza, sandwiches, wings, etc.) We walked in that door by mistake once and saw some amazing New York style pizza being made, before we realized that we had gone in the wrong door, and they said so warmly, \"Just head through the hallway, here.\" (instead of telling us to go back outside and down to the next door) ~ Wonderful Italians, Wonderful Italian cuisine",

The wife and I normally come for happy hour but we've sat in the dining room a few times. Bartender is the funniest lady in town and the owner Dave was a standup guy. My server was Evan and he was hilarious to say the least. He had jokes for days but is also really good at his job (didn't even use a pad to write down the orders) and if you can request a server make sure it's him. The last two times I went it was him and everything was perfect. The artichoke appetizer is off the chain and I always go with the eggplant parm.   However, I came in recently on a week night and it wasn't busy and I was extremely disappointed. Not with the food however, but my server. My wife and I had some relatives in town and were seated immediately and taking care of by Will. (I believe that was his name) it was 7 o'clock or so but apparently he had somewhere to be. He was extremely rude and straight up disrespectful for no apparent reason. Not sure if you had a bad day or whatever it was he decided to take it out on my sister, brother in law and my wife. Our food was good and came out right but we left with a sour taste in our mouth because of him.    We will be back, but ONLY for happy hour sitting at the bar top that way we won't have to deal with him.",

    "text": "I was going to give them a 3 because the ordered arrive with 3 pieces of my delivery order missing. They did not call me about this mishap. I had to call them. And they were nice enough to apologize but said I needed to call yelp/grub hub to ask for the refund or send a driver back to redeliver.   So, I did and while on hold I bit something so hard it hurt and almost chipped my tooth. There was what looks like a piece of porcelain plate IN my pasta (that I was eating out of the to go containers so it was NOT from our house. Plus we have black plates, bowls and cups and this was white-ish)   Yelp was not able to send the driver back so the 3 main things I wanted were missing, not going to be replaced, and all they did was reimburse me for the items NOTHING else for the huge inconvenience. They said next time I come in that they would make it right (whatever that means...they didn't specify) but now that I found stuff in my food I don't expect to ever return and it's just a wash on it all.   To be fair the pasta was good and the portion for the chicken Parmesan was huge but didn't taste the best. The cheese garlic bread was delicious.",

When I consume food that has either in it my stomach is not happy for a few days. Given that it is an Italian restaurant, I wasn't sure I would have much choices.   To my pleasant surprise the restaurant was SO accommodating. It's a quaint family owned spot. Our server was one of the owners and he was so polite. I asked for something that was not on the menu, just grilled salmon plain and steamed veggies. He asked no questions, made no weird faces and made me feel totally comfortable for asking something out of the ordinary. It came out perfect, salmon was perfectly grilled and the veggies were fancy looking! I was so happy. The rest of my family raved about their meals as well. Especially Emma's dumplings. They even brought out complimentary desserts for my grandma with candles! What a fun night, everyone enjoyed themselves so much. Thank you Pasta Brioni staff!",

What a mistake. The food was slightly better than Olive Garden. We walked in and there was nobody to greet us, we wandered past the kitchen and asked the cook if they were open. Our server was working the place by himself, it took FOREVER for any service. There was one other table in the place beside us, and it was slooooooooooooow.Well over an hour for lunch, with four people in our party, and one other couple in the restaurant. No lunch prices, just a dinner menu, I spent 27 dollars plus tip for a bowl of pasta and a glass of iced tea. (great rolls though.) The owner never bothered to come out and say hello, or thank us for coming to his restaurant. How they have stayed in business as long as they have is beyond me.",

Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.  The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.  The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.  I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.",

The food and service were amazing, despite the challenges of feeding 75 people all at once.  Servers got us our drinks quickly, refilled our water glasses often, and kept those huge yummy rolls coming!  We ate family style (ordering 4 big dishes to be shared), and yet the kitchen was able to accommodate a few of us who had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free).  The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come!  The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery).  The meat-eaters at the table were equally ranting and raving about the veal shiitake (in a marsala sauce) and the chicken martini (in a white wine sauce).  Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Phoenix!!",

    "text": "We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday.  We chose Pasta Brioni  based on the Yelp reviews.  I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives.  The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full.   This is where the service stopped.  We were sat without menus for 10 minutes.  Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials.  Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink.  A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item.  He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter.  After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order.  He took our food order and turned and left.  I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order.    Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink.  I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened.  He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do.  I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins.    Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner.  The manager? or host?  apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly.  Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either.  Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it.  My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done.",

The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff.  The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help?  Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue.    The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good.  The only downside was locating it.  When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility.  It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street.  We drove by a couple of times before figuring that out - just glad we didn't give up and miss out on the great meal!",

WITH a reservation.  So we called Pasta Brioni.  They rearranged things to get us in last minute, fed us a great meal with superb service, and gave us a glass of wine to compensate for the stress of the evening - that they did nothing to create and everything to solve. Yes they were a tad more pricey but SOOO worth it. Save yourself a lot of stress and just come here. Thanks Pasta Brioni.",

I hadn't been to Pasta Brioni in quite some time, but when we were organizing a bachelorette party one of us suggested this place for dinner because of the hot waiters (yeah, I'm just gonna be shallow, and not play coy about that) & its proximity to Old Town.   I think they actually offer set menu deals for large parties, but with a group of girls (who may or may not by picky eaters) we didn't take advantage of this. I don't think any of the set menus include alcohol.   I had the mushroom risotto & it was fantastic! It was creamy, but not too creamy, and they're was just the right amount of vegetables to risotto. I didn't care that I was amongst all girls, I happily ate the whole thing.   Service was fantastic as well! I believe our waiter's name was John (I can't believe I can't 100% remember his name) & he definitely played up the fact this was a bachelorette party group. That being said, all of our orders were correct (except for one minor drink order) and everyone was very happy with the food and service.   I should also point out the bachelorette got a special dessert at the end of the night ;)  I would definitely come back to Pasta Brioni for any type of meal, but I would especially keep them in mind again for a large dinner party.",

Portions are generous and delicious!   I enjoyed the spicy sausage pasta!    This company pays attention to detail with fine glassware and even their logo on the plates!  I am sorry that I didn't have room for dessert as the cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake are to die for!   I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in town!

We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion.  There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back.",

When I opened the container with my Penne Vodka I noticed an odd smell, like a chemical smell.  But I brushed it off and we sat down to eat. Both me and my boyfriend found the food to be inedible. He ordered the Penne Alfredo.  We could not seem to identify the offending taste except that it seemed fishy or like a chemical of some kind.  That got me thinking that it's probably the Togo containers they are using are emitting some chemical when very hot food is placed in them. We spent over 40 and we had to throw it in the trash. We will come in and give it one more shot but without the Togo containers mucking it all up.  Like I said they gave big portions and we were excited to eat it bc it looked great so they still get 3 stars for that.",

The hostess greeted us and immediately sat us at a table in the dining room, sigh...no room on the patio....  Once we were seated our server came over and was nice but just not what we expected. We ordered the fried ravioli and it was fantastic!!  Then we decided to split the pasta, there's an up charge of $4, not a big deal. After approximately 10 minutes the manager brought out our food. Here's where things go downhill. He set down the bowl, looked at us, took two bread plates from an unused table and left! Would have been nice to have a spoon, other than the teaspoon, to serve the pasta, and a bigger plate. Water never filled, we were asked if we wanted more but this was after we were finished eating. Only one bread plate, so I used the butter plate for my dinner roll (roll was ah-mazing!!!). We spoke with the manager who simply stated, \"I guess I should have charged you the $4.\"  If that means we get two bowls and a serving spoon, then I say, please charge us!!!  Not sure we will be back. Oh, one last thing, bus boy said, \"hey guys can I take this?\"  Good lord, lose the tablecloth, cloth napkins, light on table, reduce prices, and then we will be okay with this service. Not sure we will back. Too many options in our neighborhood to deal with this type of service.",

The food has always been excellent and we really never have had a complaint. Service is average at times. Last night my wife and I joined another couple at PB for dinner. My wife ordered the lamb chops which where cooked well past medium rare. When the waiter inquired about or meals my wife mentioned that the cops were over done. He peaked at the chops and agreed that they were not as ordered and offered to redo the dish. My wife said ok. 10-15 minutes later when everyone else was nearly finished the waiter walked by the table and noticed my wife's nearly full dinner plate. Something clicked and he headed to the kitchen. Our guess is he forgot to place the reorder or the kitchen did not do it. He came back to the table almost immediately and said the chops should be out shortly. My wife declined. They did remove her dish from the tab but  did not even offer her a complimentary dessert. Just disappointing after so many good visits.",

We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant.  The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said \"once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!\". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too.   I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table.  I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread.   My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal,  he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said \"I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good\". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate).   We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back.  Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night.",

I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special. I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.",

Hubby had the same thing he always orders, Chicken Parmesan. It disappeared.  We were full but the waiter suggested some \"home made dessert.\"  We chuckled and asked who's home? He said the Chefs wife does the desserts, then named off the offerings. We had to have (shared mine you) the cheesecake. It was a perfect finish to our meal.

    "text": "I've been here several times over the years.  It seems like it's losing its mojo a little.  The decor is a bit shabby and in need of a refresh.  On a Saturday night it was pretty dead.  We sat at the bar and our bartender was very nice.  Her tattoos were great!  The  beer selection was kinda weak.  Memo to Brioni:  there's a craft beer revolution going on and Sam Adams and Blue Moon don't cut it any more.  The bread is very good and the linguine pescatore is always a winner.  I had an OK experience here but just not as good as I've remembered from past visits over the last 15 years.",

He did come back promptly with our drinks, ask if we would like a few more minutes and if we had any questions. How refreshing, no pushing special appetizers, drinks, or dishes. Good, old fashioned sevice. We made our choices, placed our orders, and enjoyed our meals. Good food, good prices, good service. We will be back.",

My waiter was flippin' fantastic. I'm not sure if he was the owner or manager or something, he was dressed differently than the other wait staff. He gave some fantastic recommendations, he was funny, just an all out pleasure. The food was also fantastic. I read one review that complained about the sweet butter that they serve with the bread: I admit, I was first taken aback by it but learned to love it. All in all, great food, great service, fantastic ambiance. Perfect.  And I almost forgot one more thing! One of the people I went with is gluten-free (I know, **groan** haha just kidding), and our server brought out a piece of gluten free, flourless chocolate cake on the house. We didn't even ask for anything for dessert. It was a very welcome surprise, and the cake was damn good.",

We walked in and it just smelled amazing- that's a good start in my book! We were greeted by a friendly server and given fresh bread (made in house). The bread was phenomenal and soft. It went great with some balsamic, spices and oil dipping sauce.  We chose the calamari as an appetizer and two pasta dishes that were equally as delicious and fresh as the bread. I could've kicked myself for not coming here sooner! This place is a gem! The pasta dishes were roughly $18 each and the appetizer was $10, if I remember correctly. Perfectly priced for the large quantity and fresh quality.   One of the best parts of the restaurant is that it truly was a gem. It was definitely a place of the locals and not touristy and it was a great vibe for a week night date. The ambiance was lovely and the kitchen, while open, was pretty much quiet.   What a beautiful little restaurant! Thank you for a wonderful evening, we will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Honestly some of the most flavorless food I've ever had. You wouldn't think that a decent Italian place would manage to screw up the most basic dish, spaghetti and meatballs, but they did. Thankfully I ordered this to go, so I was able to add seasoning to the sauce at home. The meatballs were close to inedible with their lack of flavor and generally old taste. Do not come here. If they can't make the basics, they don't deserve the business.",

But he had is white jacket on and was pretty involved with all of the tables pretty much the whole time.   We ordered a veal bolognese and the chicken Parmesan. Both were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were huge!  Our server was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions for dinner!   It's super casual but you could still wear something nice if you were feeling it. I will definitely return here. And next time I may share a dish so I can have some tiramisu.    A must try!!",
