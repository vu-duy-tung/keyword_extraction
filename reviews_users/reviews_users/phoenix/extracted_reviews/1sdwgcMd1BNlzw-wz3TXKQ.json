My server Nicole has answered every single question I've had for her (on average of 3 questions per visit) and she even remembers me every time I come back. That makes me feel like I'm back home in Arkansas.  Great place. Great food. Great service. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",

    "text": "First and last time I will be visiting this establishment. Management is a joke. I recently visited this location with some out of town friends. They were in town for the baseball game and decided they wanted to check out this place as we are huge country music fans. I was the designated driver as I wanted my friends to enjoy themselves. We hadn't been there to long, maybe 30 min or so. It was a little after 8:30 and we were hungry, of course the kitchen was no longer open. We ordered a couple beers and shots (I had water the entire time I was there). I wasn't feeling well and went to the restroom. (I had been struggling with a migraine all afternoon but powered through since my guests were only here for the night) There were a couple female servers in there. I did vomit and of course felt much better afterwards. When I came out the \"manager\", some kid who was probably about 15 years younger than me was waiting outside the ladies room, asked me how I was feeling. At first I thought, wow that's nice of him... until he told me I had to leave the establishment because I had vomited. He said they can't have people vomiting in their establishment because I'm either drunk (which clearly i was not), or sick and therefore could get other guests sick as well. I didn't know a migraine was contagious... or what if I was pregnant. I didn't feel I had to explain myself and \"beg\" to stay at this location. I was extremely embarrassed and very mad. I went back to my friends and they were just as upset. Mind you none of my friends were drunk or anything as we had just arrived to that location. The manager was a complete joke even when one of my friends tried to politely explain to him that he was in the wrong. I expected more from this location. Needless to say we won't be visiting this location ever again. We of course went to another bar and managed to spend quite a bit of money there and had a great time.",

My friend was very understanding of them questioning her out of state license, however they took 15 minutes to get back to us and here they told us that they would not serve us because they respected the right to refuse service to anyone. I am 25 years old and we both politely sat at the bar. We provided credit cards, work identifications and yet they still did not even bother to offer us an apology or ever offer to serve us food.  Once again, I understand that it is in university town and the need to be cautious about fake IDs is necessary. However this situation was handled unjustly and inappropriately.

    "text": "My husband and I have been to the this same restaurant in Scottsdale and had a great time during the Nebraska football season. We tried a different location on a Saturday night and we will never go back. To set the scene, usually it's pretty busy on Mill avenue on a Saturday night, but with most of the college kids gone for the summer it was pretty empty. We ordered drinks (which the waitress got wrong) and then ordered the smothered fries. Those were the only things that were good about this experience. We ordered dinner and I got the chicken and waffles and my husband got the steak. Our friends ordered food, but they completely messed up her order and did not get her food until we were almost done. As for the food, the chicken was burned and so were the waffles. I make it a point to try different places for chicken and waffles since it's one of my favorite meals. There was hardly any sauce so the food was very dried. My husband's steak was not cooked properly and the salad was brown. But what made this experience so low for a review is the tech processing fee they add to the receipt. We asked the waitress what this fee was about and she told us it is a credit card processing fee. The problem with that story is that the fee is placed on your ticket regardless if you are paying cash or a credit card. We hadn't even given our credit card and the fee was on there, if we were paying cash she said we still had to pay the fee. Now if you are going to charge someone a fee to charge their credit card, you need to say that up front or post a sign. But the idea of charging a fee to use a credit card is the price you pay to do business. I have never seen this fee in the many restaurants we go to in the Tempe area, so buyers beware. If the food and service was great than I might ignore it, but with horrible food, horrible service (not taking any price off the meal after getting it completely wrong) this restaurant is horrible to their customers. There are plenty of great restaurants on Mill...go to any of them and avoid this one at all costs.",

Upon checking in, I got a an offer for free southern fries! Service was very fast and friendly. My friend ordered a cocktail that she didn't really like so we stuck to drinking a few beers and the order of southern fries.  The southern fries are really good! But the fries do get soggy kinda quick so next time I'll probably ask to make the fries extra crispy. But that BBQ sauce they drizzle on top is so good. It was a very huge portion as well for an appetizer! The chicken on it was very flavorful.  As for the beers go, of course, it is always good but I ordered the orange blossom (I think that's what it's called) but when the server came back, she told me they ran out. When she brought the bill, she charged us for the beer that I never received. She said she will void it out when she rang our bill but she never took the beer off the bill and so we were still charged for it. That's why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. She should have taken the beer off before running our card.",

    "text": "I don't know what it is about clubs/bars... but they are so incredibly inept about getting bottle service!  So here's the scoop... I reserved a table a week and a half out for the girlfriend's birthday. First question, what package do you want? Got it. Second question, what time would you like to arrive? How about 9?   NOPE. Sorry, we don't start service until 10. OK, fine, 10pm then.  I get there at 9pm and say that I'm there and that I'll come back at 10pm to start service as agreed upon. I come back at 10pm and they use their walkies to say get table ready and to wait by front for host. No host... no host... no table... 30 minutes go by (I'm just conversing with my party keeping them occupied at front). I ask again, are they coming? Oh, yeah, call again... no host, no host... no table. Another 30 minutes roll by. So now it is 11:00pm. Finally I get pissed and ask where my damn table is at.  Oh, OK, here it is. I get seated at 11:30pm. Awesome, now I have 2 hours and 30 minutes to drink a 30 pack and a bottle instead of 5 hours as I wanted (9pm). Half my party has already drank on their own tab and doesn't want to drink the bottle service.  Awesome. Another little nugget of joy is that when I am patiently waiting I see that there is actually indeed bottle service at some of the tables. So why tell me 9 is not available?  Also, some bottle of champagne got added to the service despite nobody drinking the table items that were already there. Not sure if someone ordered it without me or if DB thought it'd be a nice gesture to give it to me and charge me anyways? (If DB just lets anyone in the party put a bottle of champagne on MY tab, that is interesting too).  The only two things that were positive were that while we were waiting over an hour for the table, they came and gave my entire party a free shot. Secondly, everyone enjoyed their time there. Despite these fun items the facts still remain... I got seated way late... I didn't get the package I ordered a week prior... and worst of all instead of the party enjoying a table on my dollar they had to buy their own drinks most of the night.  Bottom line is that bottle service is a premium service. And to me being seated hours after me desired time and over an hour after the agreed time is just unacceptable. Dierk's is a good party place... but I felt like I was just a cash-cow patron. So long as they got me my table SOMETIME during the night, they could charge me the full package price. I get the feeling that unless you are buddy-buddy with the owners/servers/bouncers and come every week and get bottle service that you are going to get yanked around. This is generally my experience in Scottsdale and now here at Dierks.  One last note is that if you're looking for a country bar - this isn't it. I'm not sure I heard much country at all.",

    "text": "Saw a movie at the nearby AMC and wanted to grab dinner after with my party. We started walking towards Gordon Biersch but saw Whiskey Row on the way. \"Hey let's give this place we've never been to a try\". Wish we hadn't.   It was super loud inside (due to the TVs/sound system) -- to the point where we could barley hear one another at our table. Our server came fairly promptly and was nice. We put in our order and the beer came quick and the food followed soon after. Personally, I enjoy a gap of 15 minutes or so between beer and dinner but the food was out in under 10. That was impressive considering the place was fairly full.   My main reason for the low star rating is the food was just so weak. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and it was so underwhelming and disappointing. It didn't taste abjectly bad but I've had much tastier McDonald's food for 1/4 of the price. When I order chicken and waffles I look forward to the sweet and savory. The fluffy waffles with syrup and then the crispy fried chicken. I got two tiny waffle pieces with some very bland honey. Both waffle pieces combined were about the size of one eggo or less. The chicken was little better but not much. Seemed like a costco bag of frozen chicken with some soggy crust.   Whiskey Row is trying to do some sort of elevated fancy version of chicken and waffles and it failed hard. In fairness, some of the other members of my party got burgers and they said they were at least decent. When it came time to leave it look a long time to get our bill and then after waiting 10 minutes for out waitress to come pick up our credit payment we scrounged enough cash together for the bill so we could get get the heck out of there. They did a couple things right, and I don't think I got food poisoning or anything, but there are so many other good places around to eat I don't plan to come back until they get some legit chicken and waffles!",

It wasn't packed, was playing good music, and we were seated right away. Our waitress came right away and took our drink order.  We weren't quite ready to order when she brought the drinks so she told us she'd come back in a bit.  I think we messed with her MOJO because we almost felt as though she'd forgotten our table. A young man asked if we'd been taken care of and he'd gone to find our waitress.  She arrived with an apology and all was good.  I ordered the wrap and have to say, I normally don't get them.  The only reason there was any left in my plate is because I simply couldn't fit anymore in my face.  The side I had opted for was an order of garlic fries and it was a very generous order. I felt bad for barely touching them.  Our server carried on great conversation with us.  The atmosphere is a little loud but if you like country music and various televised sports, you will like this place.  It looks as though they remove some of the tables and maybe dancing takes place.  We had just gone for dinner so not quite sure about that.  They have craft beer but they also have my favorite good ole Coors Light.  Same owner doesn't mean same menu. Thismenu is more directed to burgers and fries",

    "text": "Popped in here with a Broski of mine after work for a few beers and apps. Again, another tale of two experiences with a Tempe/ Scottsdale restaurant. Sat at the bar and ordered a Dos Equis and lime. Bartender was not friendly. Not mean or rude, just really indifferent to me being there. I then order the meatball slider and fries on happy hour for 5 bucks. Sweet deal if you ask me. The slider was done very well with the meatball pressed to be more like a burger. It had good sauce and cheese. The fries tasted very good but were not crispy. Like they had been sitting in there own heat and became soggy. Would have loved to eaten them crisp.   More goodness: buddy shows up and we order the grilled wings for 11 bucks. Holy crap these things are good. So I pride myself on being a wing connoisseur as I eat them everywhere. Mainly because I don't need to attract women as I am taken and eating wings is probably the least likely food to eat to attract a chick lol.   That is where the positive ends. The server then takes my beer menu from me doesn't ask if I want another, serves my buddy a second beer and then takes my unfinished Dos Equis and clears my setting. WtF. I know what your thinking, what did I say to piss her off. And I can honestly say, I didn't say anything rude or insulting to have my beer stripped away from me like a woman with a baby being ripped out of here arms. It almost brought a tear to my eye.   So, we asked for the check, she ran my card, you know the one they take as you start a tab as they treat everyone like criminals as if you're going to skip out on your bill even though your 35 and dressed business casual, of which she didn't ask to run it as my buddy owed me HH and it was his turn to pay. Oh well, we left and went to Casey Moore's for a few more beers and had a much better time.   Don't worry, I yelped that too.",

We were seated right away at a table that was too small for our party of 6...we moved ourself to a nearby table.  A young waitress took our our drink and appetizer order and we were served in a timely order.  We ordered our lunch and...and the issues began.  We ordered a hamburger...NO Cheese.  It was served as a cheeseburger.  Along with with the cheeseburger, 4 other entrees were served...like I said, there were 6 of us.  We were told that the cheeseburger would be replaced with a hamburger and Mama's order would be coming soon. No salt/pepper were on tables...so I got up and asked a server where I could find them.  She mumbled something about I would have to find someone to bring it to.the table??? We waited almost 20 minutes for Mama's sandwich to be served and almost another 30 minutes for the hamburger to come.  When we questioned the server about the delay...her answer, \" it's the regular chefs day off and he is really good.  There are a lot of ticket orders in the kitchen and today's chef is trying to catch up.  We have a lot of food and drink orders.\" .???? I guess we need to check to see when \"the regular chef\".is on duty.",

But don't worry, once you get inside it gets way worse.   The wait times to get a drink are always 15+ mins each time you order, and that's if the bartenders will even acknowledge you. The female bartenders mostly only pay attention to male customers and ignore females, and the few male bartenders only pay attention to the females.   The lines for the bathroom are long and ridiculous. At least a 30 minute wait to go to the restroom.   Lots of fights and overly drunk people.   The staff is rude and unaccommodating.

To make a long story short, when I asked the bartender for an orange juice and vodka he mistakingly serves me an orange blossom beer. I pay and tip him anyways, because he looked stressed out and ordered the orange & vodka again and he slams his tray of cups down and rolls his eyes pours the drunk and abruptly slides it to me without even looking at me.

Moments after being seated our waitress came over and introduced herself, offered us waters, and broke down the menu for us. A few minutes later she returned with the waters and asked us if we knew what we wanted. We didn't know so she gave us a few minutes but returned the second we decided, like some mind reader. We ordered and before we knew it our food was there. It was FANTASTIC. I ordered the pretzel turkey melt with a side of broccolini. The flavor was out of this world. With the melt, from the pretzel bun to the lettuce, you can taste every ingredient. I know with some of these celebrity chain restaurants the service or food can me sub-par. This time Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row definitely delivered. I would highly recommend it.",

We sat and waited for over 10 minutes and NOBODY approached us. None of the bartending staff even acknowledged us. The bar wasn't full, the restaurant wasn't busy. There is absolutely NO excuse as to why we weren't given drink menus when we first sat down. At one point after waiting, I told my boyfriend \"let's give them another five minutes and if nobody says anything to us then we will leave.\" Needless to say, we left. Being from out of town, we were looking forward to having some drinks and saying \"we went to Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row.\" Well, we went. We wish we hadn't. BEYOND TERRIBLE SERVICE.",

What we got was the opposite of a \"whiskey bar\" - there were approximately a dozen bourbons you could find at any old bar. I felt like I was at a Hooter's - the bartenders were wearing bathing suits and worse were inattentive. We sat with empty rocks glasses for almost ten minutes. All country music was mixed until it was house dance music. Definitely NOT what was advertised.  \"Whiskey bar\"?  Where is the Pappy's?  What whiskey bar serves Basil Hayden's watered down?",

They have a great happy hour menu from 3pm - 6pm -Mon-Fri, so we were excited to try a new place.  They have signs that say 50+ beers on tab, $4 selected wine, $5 entrees & apps.  Well, we got there and they only had 1 white and 1 red to choose from because they ran out.  We had a few in our party that order micro-brews and they ran out.  Please note they do not serve Budweiser products.  So, the happy hour drink selection for us was limited.  Our waitress was really slow and kept coming back to confirm our orders and the place was practically empty so it took awhile to get our drinks then we order appetizers which surprisingly came out pretty fast.  Anyhow, our waitress was really nice but a little clueless she really didn't know her beers, wines or the redneck cocktails she kept referring to the menu.  The place is a really nice & spacious great for large parties, it's unfortunate that our large party did not have the best service.",

Yep all over 50!  Sitting at bar before 10 pm. Guy walks up and says, \"I'm taking your stools (bar stools)\".  One guy says not now.  The 275 pound bouncer ( that's an estimate) leaves to put on his official (I am so powerful) shirt. Comes back and demands very rudely to get out of chair. The 54 year old guy said no. So instantly the guard puts him in a head lock and lifts him off the chair. He did not resist in any way. The guard takes him out the door, still in headlock and half in the air. The wife kinda freaked out and ran after them and grabbed the guard to let him go. He then threw her to the ground.  She was definitely hurt.  Another guard came to stop the rage!  Manager came and said all would be taken care of!?! Seriously, like nothing I have witnessed. We were sitting at bar having a beer. Guard could have identified himself and said he needs to take the chairs in 5 or 10 minutes because of 10 pm event. We could have finished up and left. But he really needed to show his brute and get these old folks out! We love Dierks, sorry his place is run like this.  Sad. #dierksbentley   @dierksbentley",

Buffalo chicken sandwich- a 5- also a messy sandwich, as well it was cold and the sweet potato fries were cold and old. Kale and quinoa salad- a 7; it was descripted as having grapes, there were three in the salad.  Also feta, maybe 4 small pieces.  Not what I expected with the quinoa, it was mixed with the salad sparsely. When a salad is named kale & quinoa, you expect it to be half and half.   It had good flavor. Two Dr Peppers were ordered and came out as two diets.  I asked for bbq sauce for my onion rings, it was never brought.  Cant say I was impressed with food, it was average. Definitely NOT impressed with the service. There ate too many restaurants in Tempe for me to take a chance if spending my hard earned money here again.",

Food is always pretty good and service is as well.   BUT, my first experience at this location on mill was horrible. First, we got sat at a long table outside that sat maybe 8 people. We came with 6 people so it was a good choice for a table, expect for the fact that there were already two people sitting there. It was kind of awkward sitting down, and we both look at each other confused. The couple ended up getting up and leaving. Then, we were told that we were allowed to smoke outside by the same hostess, but when we started smoking, the manager came and told us sternly that we could not smoke there. Pretty frustrating. It also took about 10-15 minutes to get a refill on our beers.   Apart from all of that, the food was great. So it somewhat made up for it.  Like I said before, I have always like whiskey row and I'm perfectly fine to give this location another chance. Hopefully they tighten some things up.",

We found the last two open seats at the bar and the bartenders were all great. We ended up staying a little longer than planned because we were enjoying the band so much. We even ran into an old friend that spotted us from across the room. Drinks were good and I even tried a new beer. Bartenders were working their tails off and doing so with a smile on their face. The only thing I could even mention to improve would be if it could have been cooler in there. But honestly, we're in Arizona and we had a near record high temp yesterday so it's all good. Can't really fault them for Mother Nature! We still had a great time and are looking forward to coming back!",

The server wasn't very good-she would go to one end of the table and take orders, then leave and come back later for the other end. She would drop something off and scurry away real quick so we could not ask for things we might need.The food was really good though. I'm torn between a 2 or 3 star review and this is why it gets a 2: the have a 3% tech charge added to all bills. I read another review that the manager said \"The tech fee is our way of being more transparent vs, just raising food prices\" BS!! Their food isn't cheap. Its just a way to screw the customers because I doubt many of them either not notice or don't ask.  If they really want to be \"transparent\" they should have the tech fee in big, bold, red letters.  A lot of pictures have their specialty drinks in mason jars. There was not a mason jar to be found and we ordered some house drinks. I felt ripped off paying 11-12 for a drink that came in a regular highball glass. AND- please teach your bartenders that a Lemon Drop Martini ALWAYS HAS A SUGAR RIM!",

I insisted on speaking with manager, Jimmy. Jimmy reiterated there was nothing they could do and that we should just call the bank and challenge the charge, and that it would be a lot of work for him. He said they have too many customers daily for him to look through the receipts. Jimmy has no interest in helping or investigating why their employees are strealing from customers. Will never be returning to any of their locations. Thanks for the help Jimmy. I'm contacting their parent company, Riot Hospitality, on Monday.",

One was a basic hamburger slider, which, as far as sliders go, was a step above the rest. The other was a fried chicken slider. Different. Good flavor but a little dry. I preferred the standard slider. Service was a little slow. There was a big crowd of us, so it is excusable, but items that were said to be back out \"soon\", never seemed to make it back out.  Like their sister locations, the look of the place is nice enough. Pretty standard sports bar, with outdoor patio, TVs circling the bar, and plenty of space to work with big crowds. The water is terrible. Not their fault, as I understand Tempe is having issues with their tap water, but definitely avoid drinking it or anything with water as a base.",

Thursday nights are best for country western dancing, and Friday/ Saturday nights they add in a little pop music. This is a bar is targeted at a younger crowd, so if you are looking for traditional country dancing, this probably isn't the place for you. It gets too crowded for line dancing or two stepping. But, if you like other music or country with more of a beat, then you will enjoy this place!",

The first problem is that the hours on the website and on the actual door of the restaurant are wrong.  The second and more important problem is that they don't serve brunch. Well, they do actually, but only during football season.  They have a brunch menu online, and there is nothing saying it's just during football season.  We were also told that some of the drinks on the menu weren't available anymore.  The plus side is that the lunch food we ordered was very good, and the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere later on I'm sure was great, but they really should have up to date information on the website, the door, and on the menus.",

    "text": "We left in tears.  This was how it started...  We had a reservation for 7:30. Upon arrival the line outside to get in was long- we asked the employee out front and he pointed to the back of the line. Finally- I went up to the roped area and explained we had a reservation and the men let us in. After getting seated we all ordered drinks and appetizers-before the drinks came out our waitress came over to take our orders- we needed a moment to look at the menu as we were a large party of 10. The waitress said, with a smile, no problem I'll be back in a few minutes. About 45 seconds later a man came up to our table and very assertively explained to us that 1. We were already late showing up for our reservation and 2. The kitchen closes at 8 and if we don't get our order in when our waitress comes back over we won't be eating... We ordered our meals and continued ordering drinks. We were having a wonderful evening, drinking, visiting, and soaking in the atmosphere. The same man as previously mentioned came to the table on my side and said right in my face that we were taking too long eating and needed to hurry and leave because the table was booked for 9:00. ( why would you book a party of ten for one hour and a half anyway?) I tried explaining to the man that we were still eating and he began getting louder and louder. I'm not sure why he was hovering above my head and yelling - but I did ask him  to calm down, take a step back and we could speak about the problem rationally- I said that everyone at the table was working professionals and that we would like to stay and get dessert and finish our meals - he just continued yelling at me. My friend next to me saw the situation and began to try and see what she could do and he just kept telling us we were leaving. I was so frustrated and insulted. I then told the man that I felt like he was harassing me and he smiled and began to laugh. (This was when my dear sweet friend became tearful) Our table was cleared, my Mac and cheese taken away, and my drink gone. This very mean man then went around the table and handed the check to a male member of our group to settle up.  I believe that I was treated poorly because I of my gender. I believe that this mans tone, volume, demeanor, and the fact that he was standing over me were harassment. If this man would have chosen kindness over arrogance in explaining the situation we would have gladly paid a bottle fee for the table- and easily would have spent a few thousand dollars in drinks. (did I mention we were surrounded by empty tables the entire time?) We, as a group of professionals, travel to Arizona frequently and will not go back to this establishment in the future. I hope the mean man reads this review and feels sad that he made two nice middle- aged moms cry.  I'm going to go back to my classroom on Monday and I'm going to share in our Weekly News how important it is to have communication skills, greet people with a smile, look people in the eye when speaking, listen, and most importantly treat others how you wish to be treated.  I'm also sending this review to Dirks Bentley via mail and by social media so he can be made aware of how is businesses are being managed and his name represented.  I have two reasons for sharing this review- if you are still reading it- 1.  I hope that this mean man, Rudy, seriously reflects upon his behavior and asks himself if he is happy at his job. Having a job is a privilege not a right and I hope that he finds something that shifts his negativity - because he needs an old fashioned \"attitude adjustment\"  2.  I would like to be refunded for my meal and drink that was taken away I don't think we should have to pay for what took place that night.",

The ambiance of this downtown Tempe location has a certain robust classiness to it; just like their whiskey. As a bourbon kind of girl, I definitely recommend you try their specialty cocktails and treat yourself with their chimichurri steak. Best part about this joint, it's connected to El Hefe: mingle at both establishments, challenge someone to a game of corn hole and dance until closing time. See you out there.",

Arrived about an hour before game time and were told it was a 45 minute wait for tables so we put our name down and just went to the bar to grab drinks. First of all, we NEVER got called for our table. Literally ever. They didn't even call to inform us that the wait was longer than anticipated. Strike one there. Thank goodness we found seats at the bar so that we would eat and watch the game. As we're watching the game, this security guard comes up to us and rudely tells us he needs our chairs and starts arguing with my dad. I have never been talked to so rudely and disrespectfully as I have in this situation. Do your security guards think they can talk to people however they want because that surely will make me not want to ever return. Strike two there, I'm glad we left before we could get to strike 3.",

We came around 11am for the start of the first football game & there was barely any one there so we got our choice of table. I got bottomless mimosas for $15 ($0.01 for each one after). They were good but I felt like I drank 10 and felt nothing, too much OJ and getting too sweet. So finally on like #6 I asked if they could hold the OJ and just pour the champs, she did so that was nice. For brunch I got the turkey melt, it was pretty good but super messy, sauce and turkey and slaw everywhere. I thought it would be like Culinary Dropouts turkey sandwich, but not quite. The fries were really good too. Then the slow part came when we got the check, I had somewhere I had to be after and I felt like we waited forever for the check. I kept searching around for the waitress but couldn't find her. Overall good experience, service was a bit slow, would probably prefer to come back at night for the bar scene not for a meal.",

From the atmosphere of a fun inviting scene for all ages it delivers to the staff that must have been specially hand selected by Mr. Bentley himself. This establishment has some of the best service my friends and colleagues have received across the nation. At the gate we were given respect and courtesy by the very stoic security manager, Marshal. At the bar, our bartenders are always well educated and deliver speedy service and to keep the crowd moving. truly impressive work from the bar manager, Troy, who will even recognize us from across the room and take the time to come over catch up with us and remember who we are and ensure we are enjoying our time at this location. The second time i came in we had the chance to meet Austin, the Assistant General Manager, who to this day will remember my name and welcome me with an amazing attitude. He is always running around ensuring his workers are on top of their tasks yet talking to people and deliver yet again another great customer service experience, i's starting to see a trend among this location. I've also had the pleasure of having Maddie and Nora as both my waitress and bottle service girl and i've never been more happy. She knows everybody in the building which just shows people love her and i can speak for myself and my friends saying we come back here for the staff.. Amazing job Mr. Bentley, You picked a game changing team.",

Not unheard of on a Friday night.  At least the atmosphere was pleasant, really enjoyed the live acoustic music. When we were finally seated, they sat us on a couch with what amounted to an end  table, there were six of us, you couldn't fit 6 glasses much less 6 plates had to eat with plates in your lap.  The couch was located in the play area, among giant jenga and connect four games and ping pong tables.  I do like the fact that they had them to entertain the kids however, it is not fun to be eating and have ping pong balls pelting you in the back of the head.  The staff was as attentive as they could be considering how busy  they were, they were definitely making an effort. The food was satisfactory, had minor new restaurant problems, pork chop overdone and tough, but it was tasty.  Hamburger cooked well when rare was the desired temperature.  Will give it another chance once they work out the bugs",

Of course we are all grown now in our 30s, and trying to get together with kids in tow on a week night was a challenge.   It ended up being the perfect spot. My friends' kiddos had a blast playing Jenga and bag toss while we sat nearby and caught up on old times. Our server, a young blonde girl (sorry, I don't remember her name) was super sweet and attentive. The manager and bartender were also very accommodating to us. Even took our photos a few times. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and southern fries (OMG delicious) and I enjoyed the JIMBO cocktail. I would definitely recommend this place for a low key and fun weeknight.   I'm sure the weekend is a whole 'nother animal, but I wouldn't mind checking out this place in it's peak party time slot. Thank you Whiskey Row for making our night memorable--i was pleasantly surprised! You guys rock!",

    "text": "We took the light rail to Tempe for the arts festival. Unfamiliar with this town, we read the menus of most of the establishments along Mill Ave. and decided that Whiskey Row had the best choices and prices for us. Although we waited around 5 minutes for someone to seat us, we were given the choice of a roomy booth or a massive wooden table. We took the table since it faced a bank of TV screens, most showing the final basketball game for March Madness and one showing the Yankees/Orials game.  After considering the ample draft beer selection, I settled on the San Tan Hefeweizen. It's the first time I was served a Hefeweizen in a cocktail glass but I just chalked up that faux pas to it being an American bar out west  that either doesn't know there is a special type of glass for that kind of beer or they don't have any. Or maybe the dishwasher was behind! Anyway, the beer was excellent.  We started out with the onion rings. They were crispy and hot, served with 2 kinds of dipping sauces (both delicious) in a small iron skillet. Nice touch!  We both ordered the mesquite grilled chicken breast served over zucchini, broccoli and tomato relish, drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was fantastic! The portion was perfect and very tasty. Great price too at just $12.  We can't say enough about our server. Lex was attentive, pleasant and helpful. We chatted as though we had known each other for years.  The ladies room did need some attention though. One stall without paper, one soap despensor empty. But while I was using the facilities one of the servers came in to do the same. She scrubbed her hands and apologized for the lack of attention to the ladies room. She said she would send someone in immediately to take care of the issues. She also said she worked at the Glendale location and that we should visit her there as well. I wish I had caught her name so I could mention it here because she definitely deserves kudos for being a great representative of the restaurant.  Would we go back? Most definitely.",

Bartender was very friendly, food was tasty. We had the BBQ chicken sandwich and the buffalo chicken sandwich.   We got here early, about 6:30PM. Ate, drank, waited until 9PM when we were told they were going to open up the dance floor. 9PM came and went, so we asked if they were going to open it up soon. It was decided they would wait until 10PM to open the dance floor. The place was fairly empty, we were pretty disappointed.",

We ordered food and by the time we left, it was insanely packed. There was a massive line out the door that night too, even in the freezing cold when all of the surrounding bars had no line. So dang desirable!   The food was great- lots of sandwich and fry combo options that were decent quality. The service was quick and the band was awesome. They weren't playing country music the whole time, but they did a fun mix. The bar has cool lit-up signs, lots of TVS, a rockin dance floor, stage, and sleek design.   Exciting to have a new, modern spot on the strip!",

If they don't have a beer for you, then I don't know what to tell you! The menu is relatively small for what it seems so I was a bit disappointed in that but we found things that sounded good.   Ordered the Southern Fries - definitely get them! BBQ smothered fries with shredded chicken on top. Very delish! I think ordered a steak salad and wasn't disappointed in that but it wasn't anything that made me jump out of my seat.   Overall, it's a very large space with outdoor bags and seating. Plenty of seating around the wrap-around bar as well as booths for larger groups. Overall, the staff was good but not great. Very much college students working there so don't expect too much.",

Also no signs to indicate this and how would I know cause I'd been here before with a server.

I went into the organization showing them the statement because they accused me of lying and they said they must look into.  I asked for the GM he never came out.

However, on the first Sunday of NFL football we decided to hit this spot up for some pregame beers and lunch before going to the Stadium. The crowd was super casual which was nice, my guessing was the rootin tootin drugstore cowboys were sleeping off their hangovers... We were quickly seated and drinks came quickity split. We ordered our chow and I got the whiskey burger with a side salad. I asked for a hardboiled egg and was DENIED! haha... apparently they don't have hardboiled eggs but makes me wonder what they use for their eggs in the breakfast menu... No worries though, my buddy got the same thing with fries. I showed the waitress I checked in and scored a free southern fires. They were pretty damn good... They are meant more for a bigger group since my buddy and I couldn't finish them. They have TV's galore which is a beautiful thing!!! I did however start getting anxiety because they would play a song loud as hell during commercials, it would only play 1/4 of a song them BAM back to the game... Then BAM back to loud 1/3 of a some... Then BAM back to the game... I dealt with it though. The food got to us and it was delicious. On top of this our waitress was on point.. The cooks could have tried a little harder with the salad... I feel like I was a kid, sitting at my parents dinner table and mom would throw a bit of lettuce, a couple carrot slices, and a cucumber slice and call it a salad. it was pretty mediocre, at least give me a 1 crouton... The whole place was nice and even the bathroom was clean, that was until some dude decided a public bathroom was the best place to unload a atom bomb, but the workers there were on it!!! I would def. go back during the day for more beer and burgers, next time ill skip the salad.",

A urinal opened up so I attempted to walk over and use it. The employee put his elbow in my chest pushing me back and told me it was not my turn, he then went and used the open urinal. After waiting for another to open up and  finishing my business I attempted to use the sink, when I was again confronted by same employee. He said what is your problem? I said I'm trying to wash my hands because your talking to your friends and not using it. He went on to get in my face and even threaten to \"throw me out back\". It was one of your bar backs working working during the day yesterday. Big guy over 6 foot wearing a backwards SnapBack. Remember your customers are who keep you in business, and I will never be coming back after that.",

So why not play country with a little bit of mix of rap and rip hop... horrible experience... don't portray yourself as a country bar and not play any even after being requested to play it they didnt... disappointed.",

Our waitress attempted to rush us the whole time we were seated in her section, which bugged me. We ordered a couple of appetizers, and checked in to this location for a free one. She had asked to see it, and instead of just looking she took my phone and closed out of it.   The food was pretty good, my group loved the fried pickles the most. We ordered a couple of drinks and were hanging out, catching up as my friends that were with us were from out of town. Our waitress came to our table almost every five minutes asking us if we were doing okay, then finally she let us know that she was \"leaving in 20 minutes and would be closing out our tab\".   At this point I was obviously annoyed, as she kept interrupting us to basically ask for her tips and rush us. Other then this, I would say it was a pretty cool place. Isn't normally our scene when it's super busy but might try it again.",

I'm s really so disappointed that I did.  The service was pretty terrible and the food wasn't any better. We waited on drinks, service, to order, and more on food. The bbq chicken sounded absolutely amazing but it was so dry that I didn't eat most of it. My drink of choice is always iced tea and with a country type of bar- I assumed this would be solid. It was see-through, tasteless,  and watered down horribly.  The onion rings were the only thing that I ate.  To top it all off, I couldn't have been more disgusted  that our server was carrying the leather check holders in the front and back of her shorts that barely covered anything to begin with. So unsanitary and completely inappropriate.   In all, I was so disappointed in my entire experience. Such a disservice-",

Love the country music they were playing, drinks aren't too outrageously priced and tasted fine, and the bartenders/bottle girls were smoking hot and friendly, they provided great service and kept asking people around the bar if they needed more drinks so it wasn't difficult to get a new drink like it can be at some bars. The girls were dressed in great outfits too, especially the bottle girl but all of them were great. Great atmosphere. I was a little disappointed that as it got later, they turned off the country music and started playing clubby stuff. But I would definitely go back here if I wanted to go to a bar with my friends.",

Upon arriving, however, we were told that they don't include wine in their happy hour, regardless of what the website says. So instead of paying $4 for a glass of wine on happy hour per their own website advertisement, we paid $11 for a glass of wine (after waiting 20 to 25 minutes to be served).

I was disappointed with my overly seasoned, attack of the pickles patty melt. Like it could have been a pickle sandwich with the amount of pickles that were in my sandwich. The dill in the ranch was waaayyyy too overwhelming for my liking. A Patty Melt is hard to mess up and the cook at this location definitely messed it up!",

The second round of drinks we recieved came in smaller glasses because the \"bartenders had changed\". The food was overall burnt and bad tasting. The worst of it was my meal, I ended up with food poisoning and had to miss a day of work and I am 100% sure it was the food from this restaurant. Will avoid this place at all costs. Do not go here unless it's only for drinks, even then there are more bars to choose from in the area.",

The reality of the situation didn't meet our expectations.  We thought we'd being going to a country bar with possible live bands but it turned out it's just a college bar with a DJ playing occasional country.  We did end up trying a few drinks, some wings and an order of onion rings.  The drinks were good, the wings were grilled which were nice and the onion rings were actually f'ing delicious.  Overall, we were disappointed in the place but the drinks and food made up for it.",

I've always avoided it like the plague because it just seemed like the typical \"grab a beer and watch sports\" type of place, but last night for dinner I decided to give them a chance. My SO and I were treated very well by the staff and the service was prompt about the food. The food itself was surprisingly good, the southern fries are fantastic and they give you a lot that you can share with others. The music is loud and country, which I don't mind but what's really great is the atmosphere and roominess of the booths! I had a great time here and would definitely come again!",

    "text": "I came here for Happy Hour for the first time the other day! It was pretty decent. They didn't really have a specific Happy Hour menu, as per informed by the waitress, and the cider that was on Happy Hour had run out, but my Crispin cider was only $5.50 so I was fine with that. My friends had the Whiskey Cheese Pretzel, and I thought it was yummy! They also had the Southern Fries, which they loved, but I didn't--but that's just because I'm not really a fan of bbq sauce! Other than that I liked the dish. The location was pretty spacious--airy, roomy with lots of seating but one thing to note was the fact the live music was a little too loud (a lone guy playing a guitar) where we were seated. We were seated diagonally to the singer, a good distance away, so I felt the staff there should have been more observant to the fact that the music was too loud. My friends and I struggled to speak to one another and felt like we had to talk over the music. Live music is all well and good, but shouldn't be overly loud or overbearing to the audience. Other than that, I think this place seems like a chill spot to hang, drink and get a bite to eat. I'd like to come back and try their other main dishes--the prime flat iron steak sounds delicious! I've only been here on Friday nights and weekend nights; the lines are usually long and it usually is packed to the gills with sweaty, dancing people. I would recommend people to go this place during the day or during the evening when it's a lot more chill and less intense.",

I lost my purse there over two weeks ago and had called for about 3 days straight asking if it was there was told time and time again that it was not there. Last night I received a message that my purse was found and that they had had it for OVER a week.   So you see my initial frustration where they've had it for over a week and never tried to contact me. But then when I go in to pick up my purse and talk to the manager on duty he basically said it was my fault and they had no reason to try and contact me I was the one who lost in the first place and that their customer service ends once the customer leaves, it doesn't go beyond that. Not to mention said it in the most condescending way. To me that is absolutely insane I've been in the food industry for over five years and I am always about the guests and making sure that even if my guest has left the building and has left something behind I will try and contact them because I understand the importance of leaving a good impression and being valued as a guest. I understand places can be popular and it's hard to contact someone but when it's someone's phone, car keys, I.D, debit card and house keys you'd think they'd try just a little. Or at least be sympathetic   Needless to say I will never be going back to whiskey row they have absolutely horrible customer service and they do not deserve a good person's business",

The owner came by shortly after we started eating to check on us and I mentioned that it would be great if they had Mac-n-cheese because that was all my daughter wanted tonight. He went back and whipped up a bowl of Mac-n-cheese for my daughter and made her feel so special!!! They were so kind there and for them to go the extra mile for my daughter was truly wonderful.

    "text": "This place was great before 9pm. After, it was a normal college town bar and it was awful. It was packed, the music was too loud, and by the time my friends actually met up with us it was horrible! It wasn't even midnight! There was NO country music and the country music they did play was one song mixed in between club music. One song per 5 or 6.. maybe more club songs. Absolutely no country dancing whatsoever. It was terrible. I gave it 2 stars because before 9pm, the floor was occupied by tables which sucked because i expected dancing early on before it got busy.   Now that I'm not surrounded by loud music (that was never country, at a country bar....) drunk people, zero dancing (again, in a country bar).. I will edit this to say that the service, music and drinks were great before 9pm. The fact there was no dancing? That sucked. Why have a dance floor with tables when you can have the tables around the floor outside in the space you have!? I understand there is dancing during the week.. but not on weekends? If dancing isn't popular, hire someone to teach dances more frequently to make it popular! 7pm classes, 930 floor opens! Maybe do a few drinks specials for one some immediately following the dance! The excuse that it's a college town and it's what is expected is pointless.",

    "text": "Although I do not typically provide reviews for nightlife bars, I felt the need to share a recent experience I had at Whiskey Row. I am visiting the area with a few friends and we decided to find a place to grab a few cocktails before heading back to our hotel room for the night. We received a recommendation to come here from a friend familiar with the area. It was particularly crowded around the time of the incident (around midnight) and while crowds generally don't bother me, I was making my way to the front of the bar where there was more room to stand and was a bit quieter. While weaving through people to get there, I put the nastiest spin move since Braxton Miller against Virginia Tech in 2015 on another guy attending the bar. I am 100% certain that I avoided any physical contact with everyone around me and did not spill even a drop of my 3/4 full, $9.00 Bud Light. It was quite impressive I must admit, and I even received a subtle head nod from someone standing in the corner. Within seconds I felt a squeeze on the back of my shirt from a bouncer telling me I was \"too drunk\" and must leave. After respectfully and calmly asking for an explanation on the incorrect call, he had the audacity to respond by grabbing two other bouncers to help remove me. I was obviously upset I was being forcibly removed without a justifiable reason and instantly went into a \"Draymond Green-esque\" temper tantrum (surprisingly I did not receive a Technical foul). For someone who generally shows grace under pressure, my friends felt the need to leave the bar to help calm me down. After choosing another local bar that was much more receptive to my athletic nature, I realized I will not be returning to Whiskey Row until the management team decides to switch back to the normal security crew that doesn't blow calls worse than the NFL replacement referees. If you consider yourself an athlete and take pride in getting from Point A to Point B in the most efficient manner possible, then this place is NOT for you. For those concerned about the well-being of the innocent man whom I did said spin move on, I'm happy to report he is at home with his family and friends recovering from a successful double ankle replacement surgery (I'm kidding, his ankles are fine). Although I do not have video proof of the incident, please find the attached links for a similar comparison:   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fwq6ComNZ_Vs&s=21915cd6fed426a099abe4497c7449c4f833822bf1c4219449144ca660f00120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/wq6ComNZ_Vs</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FozYyGoDEJrg&s=81cb49c109a6f7cd39668dbe9000c13274c278638d1788157d50bef82a2fa522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/ozYyGoDEJrg</a>  (P.S. still love Dierks Bentley)",

First of all, we called ahead to make sure they had a dog friendly patio which we were told of course they did, only to arrive and be told no they did not allow dogs. After standing at the door for 5 minutes the manager finally came over and said we could sit on the patio and there's no problem. So we sit on the patio and try to order some drinks. All of the signature drinks on tap they were completely out of. My friend ordered the Dierks Marg and it came out and it was undrinkable. After asking for a glass of wine instead the waitress came back 10 minutes later and said they were out of the wine as well. Food came out and was decent. Wings and artichoke dip were pretty good but my Mac n cheese on my burger tasted like it was box Mac n cheese. Then my friends salad came out wrong and had to be sent back. After such a good experience at the Old Town location I'm so disappointed on the service. We'll just stick to the better location from now on.",

    "text": "A strange start to our day. Walked in. Place is half full. Told there is a 15-30 minute wait. No big deal but the irony was they sat us in the booth that was vacant from the get go.  Our drink order was taken however forgot. When our server came back to get our brunch order she seemed oblivious that she forgot the drinks.  The three of us ordered different items. I had the all American cheeseburger but sub'd the American cheese for cheddar and added bacon. I ordered it medium rare. It came well done. One bite was pure salt. The fries were good but they were stingy on the ketchup.  Second order was a whiskey burger. No bun was requested and instead to be wrapped in lettuce. Burger delivered with bun. Sent back and they brought it out just on the plate as they have no full leafs of lettuce there. Only chopped. The least  they could have done was put the burger then on a mound of lettuce but nope they didn't. Additionally the burger was devoid of the bbq sauce and onions.  Lastly ordered was the breakfast sandwich. It looked amazing when it was delivered although my friend ordered the egg fried hard and it came medium (still runny yoke) she sent it back to have the egg cooked longer. They sent a replacement egg done no better than the first time.  She chose not to wait and rather eat the sausage and cheese with the brioche bun.  I'm sure they have the potential to get orders right here and I will give them second try on another trip. Let's just chalk this up to a hungover staff. It was a Sunday late breakfast time and the Cardinals did play the night before.",

I had the steak salad and the combination of blue cheese dressing and balsamic glaze was divine. My hubby enjoyed the flat iron steak topped with a chimichurri sauce that was cooked to perfection paired garlic fries and creamy horseradish. He said the combo was to die for!!! Thanks for the recommendation Sahalie! This place is a gem! We will definitely be back on our next visit.",

Music- country hits all day- what's not to love Air Conditioning is on- yeah it's hot out  Cons: Sat down at the bar and slowly four girls looking for server jobs trickled in and were waiting at the bar for Manager Kevin - a few had already interviewed with him. They waited patiently as the all realized they were all scheduled for the same 3pm interview (Side note- yes it's 3pm and I'm on vacation but seriously- this is a business and I'm still a customer AND in management so that is just poor leadership) These poor girls were paraded one by one to a back booth in front of the 10 of us at the bar - poor form in my opinion.   WORST THING EVER: We are in Dierks Bentleys bar  Dierks Bentley is performing live on National Television and not only did we have to ask for it to be turned on to SEE- but we still can't hear song number 5 that's playing live- Somewhere on a beach- fav song by the way Guess we figured this bar would know when their owner was live on national tv.   Overall- great place BUT... Maybe access to the owners schedule would be beneficial to the manager. ( I'll send him my fan club password)",

We did order a burger which was decent, nothing that blew us away, took 30 plus minutes to get it. Our experience in Scottsdale was WAAAYYYYY better than this.

When you have 20 bars to choose from within walking distance, I REALLY think your customer interaction and satisfaction should be ON POINT every second. We went and day drank the very next day and believe me.......we walked right past this place, no desire to go back in.",

    "text": "This restaurant started off on a bad note because I had my medical service dog with me as I was traveling from out of state and was refused service to eat inside the restaurant. When I assured Chris that this was a medical dog that I had her jacket on he said that he did not care because health department code in Arizona trumps federal code when it comes to medical service dogs. He said that if I wanted to eat I would have to eat outside on the sidewalk. I asked to speak to Chris' supervisor but he said that he was the only supervisor in charge.  My daughter really wanted to eat at this restaurant so I said OK. Our food took quite a long time to make it to our table.  Upon the 1st bite of the macaroni I knew it did not taste right. With the 2nd and 3rd bite I knew something wasn't right. I flipped over my macaroni only to see that the bottom side was completely burnt. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and I asked could she please bring me more Mac and cheese as this was burned. She apologized. About 15 minutes later I ask again for the Mac and cheese and she said that a new batch was on the way out and that she would bring it to me as soon as possible. I waited about another 15 minutes I never received more macaroni and cheese. My food should have been comped from this experience but it was not. I did not leave a tip. Instead on the receipt I wrote failed Ada and failed to give me my macaroni and cheese . Chris refused entry into the restaurant based on the fact that he said he did not believe my dog was a medical service dog. He should be fired.",

We took advantage of the drink & food specials for happy hour! We both tried the American burger sliders / tomato aioli sauce / grilled onions / fries, but we both skipped out on the opinions! The burger was so juicy and fries were nice & crispy! It was only $5 too! Next visit I want to try the grilled whiskey wings! For drinks we both tried a fruity drink (unfortunately I can't remember the name) that came in a cute mason jar glass!!! I'm a sucker for drinks that come in cute glasses! Later on in the night we had a few shots of whisky thanks to the lovely couple sitting next to us and then tried the raspberry riser! All drinks we delicious & bartenders were very attentive and one of them even made my friend a birthday drink! They have super fun games outside like corn-hole & a giant janga. Later on in the evening they move all the chairs/tables and the whole place becomes more of a country dancing bar! Great music / great vibes / great drinks / great staff! Can't wait to go back!",

And as a bartender and being in the industry she was awesome. And to get technical she had the most consistent pours I've seen. Being in the industry you \"count\" when someone pours a drink. I've watched her pour over 20+ drinks and \"counted\". I was amazed. I'll definitely come back.",

Had hummus and it had enough garlic in it to kill a horse, the veggies were supposed to be pickled and they were bland, the moscow mule was definitely NOT made from fresh ingredients, the music was bad and the bathrooms were dirty.   Seriously, only gave this two stars because our server was nice, when she decided to come around and we were able to get seated right away with a party of 7.   I guess this is the kind of place you want to be drunk before you walk in the door. Otherwise, your expectations may be too high.",

I let Kate know and she offered ice (they apparently don't have cold glasses). She then asked for card and I lean to my friend and say \"This is why we don't come down to Mill.\" She then makes a smart remark about company policy (I never disagreed). Next, our friend ordered a Stella, minutes go by while Kate socializes with boys at the bar. Finally, we get the attention of the bar back who then has to get Kate to help us. Apparently, my comment \"Service at its best,\" upsets Kate so much, she feels the need to get Keegan to ask me to leave the bar. Excuse me, but I am a paying customer, who calmly pointed out the flaws in her service. Will I be going back??? NO, and I will make sure to share my experience with others.",

I waited in line as it was busy, when I got to the front of the line a man cut in front of me me, that obviously knew the bartender. He ordered a drink, and when I protested and told the bartender I had been waiting for some time, he told me to F off. I gave him the finger!and that's all, and he called security. Four men came and talked to me and thanked me for not causing scene and asked me to come talk to the head of security. I fully cooperated and talked him and he told me I was kicked out. Now let me just say, the dud who cut in front of me, taunted me while waiting and I kept my cool. With out sounding arrogant, I am a 250 ld, ex professional athlete and a former military man that could of done serious damage, but walked away! The head of security was Jordon, he would not give me his last name, and yes it was hard to walk away. I never raised my voice or acted in way unbecoming! I ask all military people in community to not do business with them or help Dierks music career, until he looks into this and takes appropriate action. I grew up on cattle ranch and am huge country music fan. So now we will see if the rubber hits road! What will you Dirks??  Please join me, as the little man",

Even had one in the party that had to order a drink three times before finally getting served-and it was iced tea.   Food service was similar in that we started receiving some of our entree's before our appetizer order got to the table.    Too many other choices in the area to return here.  Waitress seemed more interested in other tables.    Most attentive of the staff was the food runner who checked on us on a few occasions as was more personable.",
