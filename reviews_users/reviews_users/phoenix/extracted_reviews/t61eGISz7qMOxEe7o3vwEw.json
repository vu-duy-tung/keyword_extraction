I am not exaggerating by saying there must have been at least 20 olives in the single bowl. If I go back I would make sure to say leave off most of the sauce and olives.",

The soups are fresh and they have many different types of grilled cheese.  One particular is served on a pear bread that is amazing!  The kids menu is even good.  Not that substituted junk food many restaurants will skimp on when it comes to the kids menu.  Only one thing I would change is they serve an amazing peach/pear cobbler and the fruit is very skimpy.  It needs more fruit and less topping.  You kind of have to dig around to find any fruit.  Maybe it's because the time of year and they will add more fruit around summer.  Not sure...

Perfect Pear has hit the spot with their Buffalo Falafel sandwich. The falafel is moist, there's a good bread to filling ratio, and the spice level is just right. This sandwich is probably the most comparable (to buffalo chicken) vegetarian dish out there. I love that they've added shredded carrots and sliced celery. Genius idea! This sandwich will be my go-to anytime the hubby wants a burger from In and Out (across the street). My review is based almost entirely on food, as I ordered takeout. The place was almost empty on a Sunday night, so of course I was greeted upon entering and was helped right away. My reasoning for leaving the fifth star off this review is that I also ordered a kids meal to go and after reading the menu (can't be found online, you have to get a copy in-house) saw that it was supposed to come with a drink. I wasn't offered one.",

We need to make this happen.\" Pear bread, perfectly toasted, meshed with brie+ four-cheese blend, bacon, and arugula. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! There was a balanced compliment of textures, from the slight crunch of the toasted bread, creaminess of the cheese, and cool crispness of the arugula. Flavor wise, it was equally balanced. The light, spiced pear taste went well with the smoky bacon and mild cheese.  There was a small hiccup with receiving our drink orders, but other than that service was great.  Definitely a place to go to again to try more delicious sandwiches.",

First off, I appreciate the happy hour type specials available at lunch. I had the small hummus plate with cucumbers from this menu.  Nothing to write home about.  Another person ordered the cauliflower nachos from this menu and added chicken.  A perfect lunch portion for one.  She said it was delicious, and my one taste confirmed this, but by the end the flavors were too much for her and she was tired of eating it.  Maybe more of a shareable item.  We also tried the Buffalo Cauliflower for the table.  Absolutely delightful.  Great flavor and texture.  I also had the Black & Blue Brussels Sprouts.  I try brussels sprouts at every available offereing. Theirs comes with bacon, gorgonzola and spicy chipotle ranch.  I had the sauce on the side and didn't use it except for a taste. Good, not the best ever, but good.  Plenty of bacon and cooked to a nice crispness.  The third person in our party had a chicken club with fries.  No comment one way or the other but she is a very picky eater and chose the \"safest\" item possible.  Last note, the server did make an error with my order but took full responsibility, apologized and offered to have it redone.  I accepted it, as served, as her reaction to the error went a long way in the customer service department.",

He said it was really good and not as heavy as he thought it would be.   I had the Pesto grilled cheese. Pesto is one of my favorite things in the world and this did not disappoint! After eating a ton of the Nachos, I had to force myself to only eat half of this sandwich to avoid food coma. Took the rest home and enjoyed it cold that night.

Sweet potato fries? Crispy and delicious.  Sandwich? Perfectly cooked with little bits of Brie scattered in the sandwich. So good. And finally the French bistro sandwich (I think). Chicken,pear, arugula, soft baguette, balsamic glaze. I'm getting hungry again.   Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Finally decided to grab some dinner and drinks from somewhere other than my go-to restaurants near home. Grabbed a seat at the bar and was really excited to try the pear martini.... kind of seems like one of their signature drinks and many fellow yelpers have noted how great it is. Unfortunately I was told that they were out of the pear puree & unable to make the drink. Boo! It was only 5:30 pm... and they cant make some more for the evening? Went with a 2nd option (some vanilla & orange martini) and it was just terrible. Sent it back and got a beer. Safe choice. Decided NOT to have dinner there after all. Paid the tab and went to another nearby restaurant that is tried and True! Not sure if I will make it back to give it another shot or not.",

Hence giving it 2 stars solely because of promptness. Food tasted good but I have problem with the way they cook chicken. It was supremely under cooked. To the point where I had to thorugh away the sandwich. There were 5 shrimps(dollar a piece)  in linguine, well cooked. Given the kind of cooking ,I am not coming back. Quinoa bowl did taste great maybe because it didn't have any meat.",

My husband I shared and found the food tasty and delicious.    I don't know why but a lot of restaurants that offer gluten free add in a lot of pork... I have a pork allergy, so that doesn't work for me.  Not the perfect pear!  They offer a lot options which we'll be heading back to try.  We found the portion sizes perfect for lunch or dinner. Our neighboring table had a great idea of ordering the fabulous specialty salads and then splitting a pasta.  Great tip for next time.  I don't do very well with fried foods, so I just sampled the sweet potato fries.  They were nice and crisp but maybe a bit too much pepper but to each their own.  He usually dislikes sweet potato fries but polished these nice crinkle cut beauties off.  I would probably ask for no red onions next time even though not very many, I don't digest them well.  I think we'll be back here frequently as the staff was attentive, the food fresh, and reasonably priced!",

One thing we have in common is photography but when it comes to food we are all on opposite sides of the spectrum. This time I was on deck to pick the lunch location, hence Perfect Pear.  Veggie lovers at the table were happy with the field of greens salad options while I went for the BLT and some sweat potato fries. With the salads you can add shrimp, salmon or chicken depending on your taste for a little more. Keep in mind if you order the fries... get some extra ones as your friends will snack on yours leaving you wanting more.    Sandwich was just the right size and fries were good. I don't like going back to work \"stuffed\" and prefer to be satisfied. No one went with the Grilled cheese options to my surprise and the only downside was that salad's with the house blend seem to have way too much spinach and not the right balance of baby kale & arugula.",

The bread on the quad city was soaked and the sandwich had zero flavor. Quad refers to the cheese blend; the cheese either absorbed into the bread or didn't exist. The brussel sprouts were supposed to be an appetizer. They arrived on a platter, it was huge. If I was shopping for brussel sprouts I would never purchase this many. They were hard and under cooked. They needed a few more minutes in the skillet. The peach pear crumble al-la-mode was sublime. I want more!  They had an extensive list of salads. I will try again and get a salad and the peach pear crumble al-la-mode. The service was efficient and curt. The server had no time for extra words or pleasantries.  She was prompt and polite when  refilling my drink. Overall the service was good, the food not so good. This rating is 1 star mostly for the desert.",

They have a full bar and large menu.   Hostess was vibrant and on the ball.  She greeted all that came in.  We sat near the outdoor area so we had a full view.        Picking entree was difficult, so many great sounding options.  I selected spicy pasta and added chicken.  I enjoyed it, just wish they would have included a piece of bread or crostini.  Friend had a steak sandwich with fries, she really liked it.  We did have the chili queso app, it was nice and warm with minced chilis and this tortilla chips.

First who the actual hell would pay to be seated at a crooked and lopsided table? No one.... secondly you sit us at the table that's still dirtier then the outside floors.  But that's fine because we did go else where and all us I did was cost your server 20% of our over all tab.... ohhh and if someone orders a craft beer that comes In a can Please teach your servers to bring said Can craft beer and a chilled glass... I figured this was basics but your servers and or hostess who then continued to laugh with your very weakly put together front of house then we moved tables behind us which wasn't even cleaned from the time we had come in or to the point of where the hostess had to come do her job... and everyone wants higher minimum wage??  thank god we saved our selves the stupidity of you folks messing anything else us we left and left the beer...: this should be on Hell's Kitchen can someone get chef Ramsey to help them?",

The dipping sauce was terrible.  I didn't taste brown sugar at all.  It tasted only like honey.  I asked for chipotle ranch instead to dip in and that was ahhh.  I won't be back.

Delicious food, sizable portions, sweet and attentive waitstaff. They offer a you-pick-two option at the bottom of the menu, which I appreciate, so I got a half pasta and half salad. Even with that, I couldn't finish either dish and had to take them home. The butternut squash rigatoni? Holy cow. The classic pear salad was perfectly sweet and tart and textured. My husband got the Sicilian sandwich--WOW. We chose this place from the Yelp reviews, and they do not lie. Even the music played all of my favorite artists--a total win in my book.   My only gripe was one of the hostesses. I understand modern fashion, but with her scattered, unwashed hair half-up in a non-ponytail and the T-shirt-dress accidentally showing off her rear when she bent over, and the lack of make up in general, she took the atmosphere from hip and casual to almost unprofessional--a far cry from the fashionable, laid back couture of her peers.",

If you can't handle that then there is a McDonalds right across the drive, they have a drive through! I have read through these negative yelp reviews and all I have to say is.... what did you drink to make you so bitter? A locally owned, thriving restaurant.. pulling it off! Way to go to the staff. Keep working hard and ignore the ones who could have just made their own salads at home!!!",

I usually do not order mac and cheese but they have some very adult emergencies like pesto and green chili here.  Last visit I got a salad and my husband at the Cuban with sweet potato fries. It was tough to tell who made the better decision. Each bite was a flavor explosion, yum!  Happy hour specials are also very reasonable.  The ambience is nice and waiters on friendly.  The only thing I would not recommend that is on the menu is the bang mi as it is too bready.",

The last few times I've gone I've gotten the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. The first time I asked for the sauce on the side (not knowing if I'd like the sauce or not) it's great! It's kinda spicy but it's really good, the curry flavor really stands out without being overpowering. The dish comes with quinoa, cauliflower, broccoli, roasted red peppers and cabbage. I asked for it with shrimp and they absolutely do not skimp on the added protein which I love! The shrimps are large, juicy and extremely fresh. The second time I got the peanut coconut curry mixed in. It comes pretty heavy on the sauce so the second time it hurt my stomach a tad so I recommend it on the side. My friend got the Toni's perfect pasta. It's rigatoni with zucchini, spinach and mushrooms. It was seriously to die for. (I ate more of it than he did!) The sauce was rich and creamy, topped with cheese like how much better can a pasta dish get? Service is always super nice and helpful as well!! I love perfect pear and will be back soon!",

We were a party of seven, and ordered a variety of different things from the incredibly appealing menu.  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious!  The ingredients were fresh and prepared in interesting ways.  There were pear accents in many of the dishes where one might not have expected them.  My only regret was that I was too full to order peach or pear cobbler for dessert.  Recommend very highly!",

If I weren't there with my mom, I would have probably stood up and walked up to her, but I tried to be polite.   The bad service really overshadowed the food, which was actually not bad. We split the chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries (extra crispy). I liked how the sweet potato fries were crinkle cut, which is a rare find. I thought the chicken club was good, but needed more chipotle aioli. I waited quite a long time for our waitress to do that whole thing that they usually do where they check on you not long after they give you the food, hoping I'd be able to request the extra aioli at that point. My mom was practically done with her food by the time we got the girl's attention.   If you order food, get it To Go.",

We got here just as they opened, so we were seated and brought our drinks immediately. The service was really great, with our server very attentive and friendly. Added bonus, super comfy booths.  The food, however, was just fine. My chicken coconut curry soup, was good; I just feel like I didn't get very much for the price point. The fella got the pear cobb with salmon added. He said that the salad itself was pretty good, and liked the vinaigrette, but the salmon was very lackluster. It seemed like an oven-roasted salmon that was a little too cooked and not seasoned with anything. Not terrible, but not worth an extra $5 to add to a salad. Just seemed a smidge pricey for decent but not amazing food. ,Afterwards I asked a friend who lives nearby, and she said she feels the same way about it.   Also, as a side note, they do not have a separate breakfast menu despite opening at 10:30. Not a huge deal, just a little weird.  Overall, the experience was totally fine, just not mindblowing, like we expected based on the super high ratings. We might be back for happy hour or something, but it probably won't become a regular spot.",

Waited 5 minutes before anyone except the hostess would even say anything to me. All the while a group of servers and the manager were gossiping at the end of the bar. Ran out of water for at least 20 minutes until what I assume the manager came by and saw my empty glass. Then my food was wrong. Well my waitress Danielle just dropped off the food and so I waited longer explained what happened. They took the food back and fixed the original food that came out. Well my sandwich was super dry then because the had to reheat the meat which causes it to dry out, fries were cold. At this point I just ate because I was hungry. The waitress never asked how my food was and the manager never came over to ask if everything was alright at that point. So I finished my meal. Waited longer for the waitress to come back. There was another waitress who would look at me and refused to ever say a word or even make eye contact. She's blonde and tall and worked Sunday 07/14 at 11:30am to the time I left I'm sure her shift was way longer but she made it seem like I shouldn't have even been there. This entire experience was completely awful and made it feel like single parties shouldn't come here at all let alone sit at the bar and not take a table. Super disappointing. I felt like I wasn't even welcomed here.",

The Perfect Pear is a good looking restaurant, decorated nice, bistro style, but not a place that would ever be super crowded. As far as the menu options go, they had some pretty creative options from flatbread, gourmet mac and cheese, tacos, salads, as well as other options.  I decided to order a chicken and spinach flatbread for us to share and then I ordered a Mediterranean salad and added salmon. The flatbread was pretty good, nothing to call home about, it was worth the try. I wish the bread was a little more crispy... nonetheless it served it's purpose. The Mediterranean salad was pretty good. It was larger than average size and the ingredients were super fresh. As far as the salmon add on ($8) the portion was like the size of a chicken finger. There was a lot left to be desired.  All in all, I am glad I experienced... and if someone asked me to go back there, I would consider. However, it wouldn't be my first option when deciding where I want to eat. 3.5 stars...",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for a while when my hubby and I met his nephew here a few weeks ago. I ordered their \"classic\" salad. It was a decent salad but it arrived with no dressing on it. When I pointed this out to the waitress she said that people had complained about their salads having too much dressing so they had started using less. I didn't want to be argumentative but I was pretty sure that there was absolutely no dressing on that salad. When she brought it out in a small cup she pointedly referred to it as \"the extra dressing you wanted\". We also had a hard time getting drink refills and waited a while for our orders to be taken. The food was good though. The portion sizes are larger than what you would expect for this type of place. Overall, a-ok. I'm sure I'll be back.",

Had the warm bree and bacon app, Bree and jalapeno melted sandwich , with a beef chili side.  The app didn't even look good, too much grease, and too much brown sugar on the whole thing, that I couldn't taste the Bree.  My sandwich had too much jalapeno's, big thick slices, again covering up the flavor of the Bree.  The chili side tasted like it came out of a can and had no flavor.  Maybe an off day ? IDK, willing to give it another try.",

The service was very friendly and not rushed even though we needed to be there past closing.    We ordered the pear salad to share and they split it for us without asking, another plus for good service.   The salad was delicious and a great mix of ingredients.  For the main course we both tried different grilled cheese.  We decided on the butternut squash and the 4 cheese brie  (sorry don't remember the fancy names) .  They were both quite flavorful and I love their bread selections.  The food and menu are both worth your time.    The place claims to be a wine bar but I'm not convinced they have the right ambiance for that.  It's the old NYPD pizza place and while the place looks quite nice I'm not sure I think of wine bar when entering.    I'll definitely be a return visitor for the food alone.",

Took a few minutes to have the hostess greet us and then ask if we wanted to sit at the bar, since there were no tables, so we sat at the bar.  We were asked for our drinks right away and got then really quick. Our order was taken and food came out in a timely manner. I got the southwest philly with the seasonal side. It wasn't bad, it had great flavor, meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great!   My only issue was that it seemed disorganized. The person that took our drink order, was not the same as the person who took our food order, and then we had someone else ask if we wanted our check and brought it out. Everyone seemed to be working in so many different stations and not on particular ones. The restaurant needs to do get a little more organized to be more efficient.   Overall, a nice first visit.",

My husband and I walked in and we didn't know if to seat ourselves or there was a host, which there was one. After ordering our drinks, they told us our server would be right with us, which we browse through the menu and about 15 minutes later we had someone take our order and at the point when we were just waiting for our food, our actual server apologized and asked if we needed anything. They were probably short staffed that day, but the lack of communication was what had us waiting almost 45 overall in a restaurant that was almost empty.  I'll give this place another shot because of their amazing food and maybe it was a one time thing with the service, and would love to update my review, but it was a harsh first impression.",

I'd ordered the G Ma's Mac with bacon for $12.15. What I got as a watery, unappealing dish with so little bacon, I thought I was being punished. The bits I did get tasted like beef jerky.

    "text": "Really awesome restaurant! My boyfriend and I tried this place out for the first time yesterday. The menu was filled with unique, (relatively) healthy, and yummy-sounding entrees. For an appetizer we got the olive and goat cheese dip wit crostini (which we definitely recommend!!) I had the \"Perfectly-Grilled Cheese\" with pesto and he had a house salad wrap. Both dishes were very good! The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that when we visited, it was very quiet and the ambiance was slightly awkward because of that. The restaurant/patio deck itself was gorgeous but the fact that the background music kept getting turned off/down was a little off-putting. Other than that it's a great restaurant and we will definitely be back again!",

I had the fall leaves salad with beets, goat cheese, salmon, squash, quinoa, and raspberry vinaigrette. All of my favorite veggies in one. The portion size is very good for the money.

They seem to specialize in signature grilled cheese but I think \"signature\" must translate into \"contains bacon\" as 3 of the 5 options had that as a key ingredient.   I had the bacon and jalapeno. It was tasty but fell short in the heat category and was a bit on the grilled but not crisp category. Service was prompt and friendly, but the music on the small patio was a little bit loud for a good conversation.   I will come back and give it a try. They do have happy hour from 11-6 pm which includes some featured tapas along with $5 wines by the glass",

I had a fancy grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. The sandwich was amazing and flavorful.. Unfortunately the soup was not so much. It was just average, but it's a pretty simple soup, so I can't complain! The place was empty while we were there, so the service was 100%! Definitely bringing some friends in to try this gem :)",

As part of this research, I stumbled upon Perfect Pear- rave reviews, reasonably nice looking decor, proximity to work... lot of things seemed to work in its favor. I was excited to give this place a try and scheduled a business dinner here. My associates were running a few minutes late so I decided to sit at the bar and order a drink till I waited for them to arrive. I got started with the pear mule since it came highly recommended by the bartender/waitress. The first few sips tasted pretty great and the freshness of the pear brightened up the drink, which was nice. However, the flavor of lime was a little overbearing and I wasn't as thrilled with it as I was with the first sip. My company arrived and we were promptly seated. We got started with a round of the coconut curry soup, which I think was the best thing we tasted that evening. There were some incredible flavors and they were very well balanced. We ordered the hummus nachos which kinda fell a little flat. The ratio of chips to hummus was just off. After the first few bites, we were left with a plate full of plain, over salted tortilla chips. I ordered the green chili mac and cheese with chicken for my entree since they're supposedly known for it. It certainly wasn't bad by any means but not even close to being among the best I've had before. Our waitress was delightful, which was really nice and brightened up our evening. The food on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.",

We had other staff bringing a 2nd round of drinks and delivering the food.   Salads were divine. Fresh, crisp greens and full of flavor. I'd recommend the pear salad. The Mac n cheese dish was also delicious. A perfect blend of creamy and cheesy, served piping hot. It was an easy dish to finish, portions were perfect for the \"pick 2\" meal. The menu had some other tasty looking offerings so there's good reason to come back again. The restaurant was an old NYPD Pizzeria but owners did a nice job styling it to their own.

My friend got the Pesto grilled cheese with sweet potato fries (a lovely no up charge for these!!) and we were both impressed by how beautifully the romano crusted bread was..not just on the crust, but instead the entire slice!

It killed our last time here. It comes in a plastic container to go and it was soggy and looked like vomit.   We ordered to go a few times and they are very inconsistente on their dishes. We ordered the same items a few times and they never came the same. Always something missing or just not as good as the day before.",

The atmosphere was also great-easy going and nice for a casual bite to eat.

Everything was DELICIOUS, We ordered the Pacos Tacos and the bacon & jalapeno grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. Both were great portions, packed with flavors and the quality is beyond it's price. They serve taste that you would expect from a higher end restaurant but at a lot better price point! Highly recommend and will be back!!",

I had the 1/2 salad 1/2 pasta combo so I tried the spicy Cobb salad with mushroom Marsala and OMG my tasted buds were in heaven!  My friend had the 1/2 & 1/2 combo too with a regular Cobb salad and the butternut rigatoni - it too was very tasty.    It was PACKED at lunch time so bring your patience if you come during lunch hour as there was a line out the door.  Despite it being busy, we had great service.    I will definitely be back!",

There was so much food on the plate, half of it got boxed up and went home for dinner. The texture was perfect as the dish was accented with sunflower seeds for a bit of crunch.   The menu had good options.  I'm always seeking heathy options and they did not disappoint.   My friend's dish came with sweet potato fries. I had to have a sample. They were so, so tasty. I only had two bites but I know they would be hard to turn down if I had them on my own plate. (Note to self, order a salad or a quinoa bowl to avoid temptation!)  Service was good. I asked for extra lemon for my ice tea and the serve brought back four slices on my glass. I thought it was cute. See photo.  We didn't wait too long for our food at all. It wasn't very crowded but many tables were full 1:00 p.m. on a Saturday. Prices are very reasonable for what you get.   The location is perfect with plenty of parking. Instead of heading to our usual healthy food establishment, I'm going to take my husband here.  I'm sure he's going to love it.",

I went with Pacos Pear Tacos - the chicken was so flavorful and tender and the bacon pieces were the best compliment. The pear pico they topped them off with was perfectly spicy and delicious- the pear adding nice texture and brightness. They also used pear in the black beans which was so unique and so good!  The rest of the party went with versions of the grilled cheese and salads. Based on the presentation, I'm sure the flavor did not disappoint!  I'm so excited to have found this gem!",

Their menu looks so good, I was torn between a lot of choices. i finally settled on the perfectly grilled cheese- brie, four cheese blend, arugula, bacon on spiced pear bread. I love the sweetness of the bread, which is reminiscent of cinnamon raisin toast, it compliments the saltiness of the bacon and the bold flavor of brie. I also got the seasonal side which was broccoli tossed with red onions and cranberries in a sweet vinaigrette. The broccoli was crisp and refreshing but the vinaigrette made it a little too sweet for my taste. My boyfriend got the Chicken Marsala sandwich which was huge with delicious sweet potato fries.   I love the fact that their happy hour drinks starts at 11am and goes to 6pm, but its only about fifty cents off regular price. I will definitely be back to try some of their happy hour tapas (2pm-6pm) and pear blossom salad and green chili mac that I was eyeing last time.",

Pros: -the bathrooms are amazing and super clean and smell great. -the ambience is also amazing. Lovely hip decor. -menu is incredibly diverse and for those with a desire to taste unusual things  Cons: -They completely forgot our order of fries with the sandwich. Since we were just passing by, it wasn't feasible for us to drive back for it. Be sure to always check your order before you leave. -the mushroom soup was too salty for me. Tasted like a condensed version or something. Otherwise it was pretty good but I had to drink a ton of water with it. -the chicken sandwich was very ordinary and didn't seem to live up to the enticing description on the menu according to my boyfriend. He ended up throwing it out.   Overall: It's a bit out of the way so I probably won't come back. Considering all the wonderful reviews I'm thinking maybe I could've ordered better tasting things. Regardless it fell short of our expectations.",

I had the house guacamole, the fall leaves salad wrap, and for dessert the apple &a peach cobbler. The guacamole was delicious and chunky, the wrap's dressing tasted a little off but I think that was just my personal preference for its flavor. But, OH MY GOSH. The cobbler was so so so fantastic.. I highly recommend it!   The atmosphere was also enjoyable. It's a quiet place, the wait staff were pleasant and attentive, and the decor fits in with its vibe. Overall, if I ever return to Phoenix, I'll push to return to this place. It's definitely worth a stop in.",

The menu is simple , straight forward and offered up some ideas for cooking at home with healthy ingredients.    Each of the items we ordered brought up the \"hmmm\" deep in our bellies.  For starters soup:  I had the asparagus and my friends had the thai chicken coconut Curry.   The asparagus was average with just a hint of heat.  my friends downed their soup with many \"hmms\" in between bites.     next I had the Cuban Sandwich which had great textures: crunch from the dill pickles and toasted marble rye; burst of flavor dijon mustard; and savory roasted slices of pork; melted cheese If I remember correctly pepper Jack.   one of my friends Had one of the grilled cheese sandwiches....great with soup on a Fall day.   My other friend had a green salad (choice of greens) with Quinoa, beets, you name it!   A fairly large portion at that...lunch for tomorrow.",

When my party first sat down it was several minutes before anyone greeted us. After that it was many more minutes before we got our beverages. The appetizers didn't come for about 25 minutes. The entrees also took a long time. After we were finished eating it was quite a while before our server came back to give us the check. Other than the time issue, everything else about this place was perfect. The decorations inside are beautiful and it is a peaceful and relaxing ambiance. I definitely would recommend this place to everyone, but if you are in a rush, you should probably choose a different restaurant.",

No mention of Happy Hour specials and they were out of the beer we were interested in. The waiter also forgot a few things from our order and we had to remind him. The food is decent American food with some of the trendy add-ons. My salad was to be loaded with butternut squash (couldn't find it) beets (a few) bacon (stuck together) but the avocado on top - luscious!! I did enjoy the cider vinaigrette. I also asked for a piece of bread to go with the salad - it came dry, no butter included and though sweet and tasty - still dry. My friends enjoyed the 4-cheese grilled cheese sandwich but the sweet potato fries were limp, not crispy like the regular fries which were yummy. I'd like to think I may try this place again but they need to step it up to stay in competition with everything else that's out there.",

We came for lunch one weekend and they wouldn't seat us at an open table because the kitchen was backed up. We came again on a Tuesday night and there was only about 20% of the tables occupied. We waited for about 7 minutes until I finally got up and asked the bartender for service. She was very nice, but again, extremely understaffed if you can't take an order when so few tables are busy. We will come again because the food is good, but we will ensure we have no place to be and we probably won't come as often as we would if service was better.",

And did I say delicious!? I've been here twice in the last couple months (I hop around a lot), and had the Fall Leaves Salad, the Wild Chop Salad and a Fall pasta offering that's not on the menu at the moment. I would go back and have any of them again, and there are 4 or 5 other menu items I can't wait to try, too! I love that they serve the hummus with veggies for gluten-free folks - it's on the menu! Friendly, cool vibe - got to go back!",

I attribute this to being within the Ahwatukee area which is bustling with young families.  Service definitely did not have me writing home, but the food was pretty good. I likely won't come back, because it just wasn't my vibe, but that does not affect my rating.   I came here with the hubby for restaurant week, so our food included appetizers and meals. The quesadilla was good- but the dipping sauce was absolutely fantastic. I don't know what it was, just that it was awesome!   As others mentioned, the jalapeno mac and cheese was a classic, with a kick. Portions weren't huge, but we had appetizers so it was fine. I ordered an cranberry/apple salad and it was good as well.   Overall, cute spot; I won't drive the 15-20 minutes it takes for me to get there, but I am glad I tried out a new place for restaurant week!",

I came at 11, just before the lunch crowd and promptly ordered one of their grilled cheeses with pear bread, which was actually pretty good. The pear and the brie almost made it bland, and I wish there was something a little bit salty to counter the brie, maybe a prosciutto, but I still enjoyed eating it. I also had the sweet potato fries, and I disliked them- a lot. There was no sweetness to the fries, and they almost tasted like a potato chip. They were so perplexing to eat that I had to asked my waitress what it was seasoned with, and she asked the chef who said it was just pepper. You can do what you will with that information, but that is the first and last time I will taste pepper on my sweet potato fries. I'd stick to another side and the grilled cheese if you eat here.",

You can't beat that :-) They have a quaint patio and nice bar area. The only down side is I am rarely greeted when I arrive and the \"hostess stand / \"to-go\" area isn't clearly labeled so the first time I placed an order for take out I was a bit confused as to where to go to pick it up.

I tried the Marbled Cuban and my wife tried the Chicken Pesto sandwich, both ordered with Sweet Potato fries.  The meals arrived well portioned and prepared.  We both were taken back by the fries.

In place of fries I substituted the Mushroom and Brie soup, which was also very good. To be honest, I prefer the mushroom soup at Cafe Zupas because it has more mushrooms, but I wouldn't hesitate to get it again at Perfect Pear.  Cost: A little pricey but worth it it! My tab for the soup and sandwich (just water to drink) was about $12.50.  Service:  The hostess and server (Aja) were very pleasant, and service was prompt. And the place was ~3/4 full.  Atmosphere: Pleasant, although it was a bit noisy with the open spaces and music. Comfortable booth.  Overall: The menu is intriguing, I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place has become my go to restaurant for salads, sandwiches and even pasta (which is better than an Italian restaurant that is run by Italians). Personally I get the New Harvest sandwich regularly and have not had a bad experience here, and the beer menu is pretty good too. The Tuscan flatbread is a pizza that is quite tasty as well.  The only negative we find here is the music on the deck is a bit too loud if one sits by the door and the Athena's Garden had too much pesto (there was enough for a few plates) the one time my wife tried it (at the next visit we asked about it and the chef may have been a bit exuberant with the pesto that day).   The most expensive items on the menu are $11.50 so the $$ price range is a bit harsh, but the quality is way better than one would expect for the money - love this place!!!",

They saw it on some local PBS show called \"Check Please\" and decided to see what the hoopla was about. The cousins ordered a BLTA and a Perfect Grilled Cheese with sweet potato fries for both. They had enough to pack up with them to go. I ordered the Quad City Melt and there was nothing left to talk about. Soft sirloin, carmelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, mixed with the four cheeses and danced off of the marbled rye bread in your mouth. I washed it down with a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA (had to represent the hometown) and was good to go! Now if they were able to make some garlic sweet potato fries, it would've  been perfect. Danielle was our waitress and she rocked with food knowledge and the service with a SMILE.",

    "text": "Wow! So glad I decided to search for new restaurants after my ikea trip!  First off-  The ambience is AWESOME. The decor on the inside makes it almost seem like you're outside, with the string lights and high top seating. Big points from me when I walked in and heard Maggie Rogers playing (and heard her play multiple times while there too!)  Surprisingly at 6:00ish on a Saturday, it was pretty quiet and not very busy. We were seated immediately and got to look over the menu.  It has a LOT of selection, anywhere from Tacos to sandwiches to pasta. I also liked how there was a \"half and half\" option where you could combo a soup/sandwich, pasta/soup etc.   Everything was fairly priced, and there seemed to be some flavors that stayed True to the pear theme.   I ordered the Paco Pete's Tacos, and they were AMAZING! The chicken was cooked to perfection and all the flavors blended together very well. The tacos come with two, plus black beans which I subbed for fries. I also got the chance to taste the sweet potato fries, and they were equally amazing.  The only thing I felt lacked, was service. The man who sat us I felt was more our waitress than our actual waitress. We only saw her about 2-3 times during our visit, but we saw the host 4-5 times. She was not attentive and did not fill up my drink (or any drinks at the table) at all, we had to ask the host. It was just a little discouraging considering there was not a lot of people there.  But, overall I would recommend this restaurant to friends and am definitely planning on returning when I'm in the area again. It's cute, awesome priced and has amazing variety of good food!",

It has dimmer lighting in the evening with string lights inside that gives it is romantic feel to it.  The service was good.  Our waiter was nice, jovial, and actually had an opinion about what was on the menu.  Due to his recommendation, I ended up going with a Perfect pear salad and Mediterranean Mac and cheese, both were good but the Mac and cheese was the clear winner.    Lastly, it just seemed to have a good aura about the place.  People around us seemed to be in a genuinely good mood which is a testament as to what type of people want to come here - people that want good food and want to be able to enjoy themselves for a meal out.",

    "text": "Was hoping to find a new dining option as two of my favorites have recently changed their menus and taken my favorite dishes off.  Hoped this would become a viable option.  The menu looked promising but, that's where the promise ended.  We ordered the hummus and vegetables as an appetizer.  The server brought the dish very quickly and then I noticed the black stems of the broccoli (see photo).  The server in a very indifferent way said \"I'll bring you some more\" when I pointed out the issue.  She didn't bother to take away the old broccoli rather just left it there on the plate for us to \"enjoy\" while we dined...rather unappetizing appetizer and a BAD first impression.  We had Tuscan rigatoni and strawberry fields salad both with added chicken (+3$ each).  The salad was good, not great.  The chicken had quite a bit of gristle in it.  The Tuscan rigatoni was bad, not horrible.  She was only able to finish about a third of it and couldn't stomach the rest.  Second picture is of the floor underneath our table...housekeeping score = NOT GOOD!  Tried it...don't recommend it.  The search continues...",

I am not sure the name of the girl who served us but she had dark brown curly hair and her sister, who also worked there, was named Asia. She was great! Very prompt at taking our orders and very knowledgeable about the food as well as making recommendations. We tried the pear pick as it was happy hour and it was a large serving for under $5! Super great price!   I ordered the Marsala pasta which took a long time to come out, when it did arrive it was luke-warm. I informed our server and she brought it back. To which point, there was a girl running the line, Asia, who went back into the kitchen and cooked the food herself. I was amazed at this level of customer service as she went above and beyond her job duties when she saw the kitchen struggling. Plus the pasta was very yummy!   If I lived closer, I would definitely go back just for this amazing customer service! Thank you!",

We also ordered the harvest sandwich served on foccacia bread which was mostly bread with a thin smear of hummus, a couple  pieces of roasted red peppers sliced ultra thin, a large handful of sprouts which made up the majority of the sandwich and a light sprinkle of feta and a smear of avocado for $9. Outrageous! If you are gluten free be careful, selection is limited and they don't offer gluten free breads. Please educate your kitchen, this sandwich was a huge disappointment and not worth the price we paid. We thought that we would try a new place , since we frequent Pita Jungle, when we go out to eat, but we will not be back.",

Unfortunately,  I was completely ignored when I walked in even though the place was empty except for one couple at the bar. The bartender continued his conversation with the couple and barely seemed to notice me. The lady he was talking to motioned him to service me, but a waitress happened to be coming out of the back and finally acknowledged me and took my order. I sat at the bar while waiting for my order. I was never asked if I wanted a drink or acknowledged by the bartender, who continued. His conservation with the couple. Again, the lady motioned for him to service me and he disregarded her and continued his conversation. I sat for 20 minutes waiting for my food without so much as a nod from the bartender.  I have never been treated so uninvited by a place that wants me to spend my money. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the waitress was nice and the food was good. I hope it wasn't my skin color that made the bartender pretend not to see me.",

They kept raving about it, so we finally made the drive from South Gilbert to try it out.  it was WELL worth the drive.  We can't wait to come back- and said our next date night will be here.  The food was so delicious and we loved everything we got.  We started with the focaccia bruschetta, and chose the Philly Goat and Perfectly Peared.  I preferred the Philly, but they were both delicious!  Then we shared Mediterranean Mac and Cheese (huge portions!  We split it, and I still took home half of my half!)  and the bacon jalepeno grilled cheese which my parents have raved about.  Both were delicious, had fresh unique ingredients, and left us full with leftovers.  The sweet potato fries were so so yummy too!  Nice and crispy how I like them.  They let us try the sweet potato fry sauce that was honey/brown sugar mixture, and it basically tasted like dessert dipping them in there.  We can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!  Such a great place, we love restaurants that aren't chains!",

They were packed for lunch, and while we were seated fairly quickly, the wait staff was a little slow in getting us drinks and grabbing our order.  Probably not a place to grab a 'quick' lunch, but with how busy they were, it was forgivable.  Their menu has a number of vegetarian and gluten free items, and everything is freshly made.  I opted for their 'Perfectly Grilled Cheese', and it was a great spin on a classic grilled cheese.  Two thick pieces of their spiced pear bread gave it a slightly sweet taste countered by the bacon and four cheeses.  Not your average grilled cheese sandwich.  Perfect portion for lunch.  I would definitely stop back in.",

It's conveniently located near the freeway in a business park. We went on a Sunday and there was a ton of parking. The menu is pretty extensive and creative with pear worked in creatively in most dishes. The six of us each got something different and everything was delicious from sandwiches to pasta to salads. I had a mushroom pasta that was so creamy and earthy. The wait staff was great and did a good job with refills and removing empty dishes. We ordered two deserts to share, lemon cake with fresh strawberries  and peach cobbler. They were fresh and hit the spot and the server brought enough spoons for each person. The decor had modern Farm house feel with chalkboard, salvaged pieces and white tiles.",

    "text": "I don't know how or why I've never been here before but that all changed.  My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for a good lunch spot and settled in on this bistro.  No wait, we were seated right away.  The location is cozy.  There's a bar set up and a dining area.  The patio is really cute as well.  Nice touches of greenery around the area.  The waitress was very helpful and kept our glasses full.  I ordered a black tea to drink (loved!!!) and was able to try the pear mule (delicious) that inspired future cocktails for us.    I started with the asparagus soup.  So fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Typically something I wouldn't order but I am so happy I did.  I also had the half Cuban sandwich.  I wasn't super impressed by it but I'm being lame and not eating bread as of late so that could be part of it.  Green chili mac could be my only reason for stopping in.  I've never had better Mac and cheese.  SOO good.  I only got away with a couple of bites from my boyfriend's plate but it was insanely delicious.  All in all, a really great find.",

Not only was the service slow, they failed to bring our drinks, when they brought the iced tea there were no straws.  The salad was served with no salad dressing. I ordered two sides of pear bread but they forgot that too. When we were finally served the bread, it was without butter!!  By the time we got the butter, which was stale, the bread was cold.  Each time I needed something I had to ask a server who was working another table because after the waitress took my order I never saw her again until it was time to smile with the bill. The absolute worst part is that when I complained to the manager she did nothing to make amends, then asked if she could take my payment!!! I will never go back.",

Their food is absolutely fantastic, the service is always great, the portions and pricing is on point and well.....everything I've ever tried is always ridiculously delicious. What more could you want? A ton of options for vegetarians too. And their sangria is lovely! My favorite things are as follows: Cauliflower spinach dip, mexicali bowl with falafel and most recent the buffalo falafel appetizer, that really blew me away! I am not a huge falafel fan but when I had that I immediately thought \"why isn't EVERYONE doing it this way?\". I can't wait to go back. Love this location too. Small, cozy and personable.",

A very diversified crowd, from moms with kids, to business people to old folks.  Very cute inside with indoor and I think some outdoor seating.  I opted for the Paco's Pear tacos which were street taco size. They were good, just not enough chicken inside. The sauce was yummy and the pico had jalapeno which gave it a little kick. The accompanying black beans were quite tasty. Not your normal bowl of black beans. More like a soupy, salsa blend. It was good. My companion had the bacon and asparagus grilled cheese. Not that great. Too creative. We prefer a more cheesy, melty, chewy grilled cheese. The sweet potato fries were tasty.  I'd say it was nice to try, but I'm not sure that I would return.",

The happy hour pricing was a little confusing, and we were disappointed in the prices. Not the best place for happy hour drinking. Charming little place, that has a lot of potential.

There is a nice mix between booths, tables, high tops, and also a bar area so you can seat just about anyway. All the staff appeared friendly and professional.   The menu is packed full of flavorful options that I'm sure won't disappoint. I was between a sandwich or a grilled cheese. After some discussion with my server, Vanessa, I went for the asparagus and bacon grilled cheese with sweet potatoes fries. Sounded interesting but was absolutely delicious.   The grilled cheese was packed with flavors between two crispy pieces of marble rye. For me, sweet potato fries are a hit or a miss. These were a hit! They were well seasoned, thick cut, and crispy!   I did note the sandwich came out without bacon and let my server know. She promptly got me a new one ordered up and delivered out at no additional charge. It was quick and resolved with satisfaction. While I would have loved bacon the first time, I think I got the better end of the deal.   This place is fantastic. It's only been one meal but it did not disappoint and the customer service was excellent. The food options all looked extremely flavorful and delicious. The space is also nice. I would definitely consider this a great place for a work lunch or lunch in general!",

Not sure if it was just an off night, but servers seemed a little frazzled and the manager was not very friendly to us at the bar. Food was still great, but may stick to take out.",

I liked the restaurant as soon as I walked up and realized there were melons growing in the planter boxes outside. The dining area is attractive, with a pretty little outdoor patio. Our server was very friendly and prompt. There were several menu selections that looked good: sandwiches (including several exotic grilled cheese varieties), pasta dishes, bruschetta, quesadillas, and salads. I really enjoyed my Pear Blossom salad (pears, almonds, yellow raisins, quinoa, mint & feta cheese). The serving was pretty big and I worried about finishing it at first... that turned out not to be a problem at all! My mom's \"Greekadilla\" quesadilla (spinach,tomatoes,chick peas, feta, & pepper jack) was delicious. I was even impressed by quality of their coffee! I give this place a solid four and a half stars, might up-rate if they're as good on a second visit.",

I wish the thought that was put into the menu carried through into the vibe of the place. I drove a good way in rush hour to get to this restaurant because I really wanted to relax with real food and a drink or two. Sat on the brightly lit patio on the parking lot, which of course can't be helped, except maybe  for a nice potted shrub or six, but then the music is way too loud. Good music but too loud. And why would you have fake plastic plants on the tables of a restaurant that features the freshest, most interesting salads and tapas I've come across in a good while, when you can get potted herbs on the cheap at the Farmers Market? Odd mixed messages here. There is so little green space in the Valley now that I find myself constantly on the lookout for an oasis. This wasn't it, and I was disappointed. Love the Happy Hour. Love the menu. My Butternut Squash Soup and Brussel Sprout Salad was exactly what I wanted. I'll probably be back, but in hopes that the atmosphere will carry the same whimsical earthiness as the menu. If that were the case I would've stayed longer and tried more menu items.",

It has a quaint atmosphere, even when fairly busy at lunch, and it really captures a nice bistro mindset. My lunch was delicious - I got the 1/2 Green Chili Mac & Cheese, which was dark and hearty with a slight kick, and the 1/2 Baja Lime Salad. The lime vinaigrette was perfect - now I have to figure out how to replicate the recipe. The beer list was small but had a nice selection of craft beers and the prices were very reasonable - $5for a pint of Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro?!? Works for me! All in all, it's a great option for lunch, but not sure about dinner since it's so small. A+ for the lack of noise too - the ambience was great at lunch time, which is rare these days. I'd love to see more places move towards this format - smaller menu, reasonable portions and a very fair price. I'll be back next time I'm in town , that's for sure.",

They had a pretty good drink list, I ordered a Riesling that was $6 and was pretty good.  They had 3 soup options, we ordered 2 of them, a vegetable beef and the Bean and Ham, both were very tasty and a bowl was $5.  For dinner they have Soup and Salad options, which is nice, I ordered the BLTA and it looked great when it came out however the foccacia bread it was on was pretty bad, I ended up with a BLTA salad.  My dining partner had a Tinos salad with beets, hazelnuts, goat cheese and chicken which cost an extra $3.  We will likely go back but I wont order the sandwich again, they have pretty interesting salads, so I will go with that and the soup.",

    "text": "We have now experienced Happy Hour, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner at Perfect Pear Bistro in its original Ahwatukee Foothills location and can't say enough good things about it.  Last Friday we tried the new location in Tempe, which features beer and wine ON TAP, and the same awesome menu as the Ahwatukee location. Every experience has been wonderful, the food is fabulous, the service is stellar, and there are still things on the menu I haven't tried. Phoenix diners, you have GOT to check this place out. While the original Foothills location may be a haul for some of you, the Tempe location on the SE corner of Ray and Priest is convenient for many of you! Check it out and share! This place is truly a gem and we hope it succeeds!",

Stopped in for lunch and it started off badly with a long wait because the hostess seemed totally confused - she didn't seem to know if she should be bussing tables or seating customers, all the while the line was growing out the door. When our server finally got to us I asked for iced tea to which she replied, \"We don't serve plain iced tea.\" No apology, no alternative. Okay, so then there's the food. I ordered the chicken club and it was flavorless. The chicken didn't seem to be seasoned at all and the bread may as well have come from the local grocery store. Last, was the overall cleanliness - the tables could use a good cleaning and the floors were quite filthy. Can't say I'd recommend this place.",

Very delicious, appealing to a variety of tastes in our group.  There were a couple of minuses, the main issue was noise level. Inside the acoustics of the building are not favorable to many people talking and it creates a din.  Outside on the patio, the music being played was very loud and made it difficult to hear each other, every time one of us said something, the other person said, \"what?\"  The other thing was that the quinoa was under cooked, quinoa should not be served al dente.  Next time we might order takeout.",

We ordered three different appetizers: the guacamole, green chili cheese dip, and spinach dip. The guac was really good. The dips all came with a large amount of tortilla chips, cucumber slices, and crostini bread.  For my entree I ordered the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. It was a very large serving and was heaped full of fresh veggies. There was cooked cauliflower and broccoli on top and my only problem was that the pieces were quite large and difficult to cut in a bowl filled with other items. But I really enjoyed the dish. The curry sauce was a little spicy, but not too much for my taste. I thought about requesting the recipe since I liked it so much.  I had enough food leftover to save for another meal.   By the time we left, there were quite a few people now waiting for tables. It seems to be a popular lunch spot for a lot of professionals, probably due to its closeness to several business parks. I will go back again in the future.",

Interior had comfortable vibe, the staff was on point, and the food was good. For lunch, I couldn't  decide between the pear salad and the bacon/jalapeno grilled cheese. So what does one do in this situation? You get both. :) In all honesty though, I did split them with my brother. For the dishes, the grilled cheese was so good. Super flavorful and deserving of five stars. The pear salad on the other hand, had the chance at perfection but just lacked pear. For a salad and a restaurant for that matter to have the name pear in the title, I just expected bold pear flavor and as good as the pear was, there just was not enough in it. For dessert, the family ordered bread pudding and pear cobbler. Sadly, we were later advised that they were out of bread pudding. Bummer, given we were all excited to see it on the menu. With that, we added brownie instead. The brownie was just okay for me. Nothing to write home about. The cobbler on the other hand was killer. It had such awesome flavor, with what tasted like oatmeal in the crust and it was so darn good. Would highly recommend. Overall, a very good lunch that I was glad my family got to enjoy. Just missed the pear:(",

The menu is full of salads, melted cheese sandwiches and pasta, there are several interesting asps too and a few local beers.  The decor inside is a bit eclectic as this space has leftovers of it's predecessors.  A nice feature of the menu here is that most dishes here are vegetarian friendly, then meat, or fish can be added for a few $ more.   I oped for the \"Athena's garden\" A pesto linguine with a few veggies in it. It was light despite having a fair amount of oil. We also tried a salad that was well assembled and fresh.   The real winner for me was the creamy mushroom Marsala, There was cream but not an excess just enough to coat the pasta, The caramelized ions gave it a deep rich flavor and the mushrooms added to the textural delight.   If you are in the area and want a nice, good meal at a new local place give PPB a try.",

I liked my food. But after reading many reviews here it does seem that service has become an issue. The kid who seated us just grunted, dropped the menus and ran. Ten minutes go by and finally someone greets us. Food comes and we never see anyone for refills or anything. Bill takes forever. So yeah I would try again since my wife can eat here. But I am not leaving a 20% tip again if this is the service you get.",

    "text": "Well. 3 1/2 stars. A nice little place. Fairly clean (bathroom was a mess...that usually bothers me). Atmosphere a bit modern...nice. Staff was friendly.  Service good. Started with an appetizer off the happy hour menu. Brie and bacon and a fruit with toasted bread. Portion small. Brie baked to almost a rock. However is was tasty.   Had PACO'S PEAR TACOS roasted chicken, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, southwest cream sauce & sprouts... topped with our spicy pear pico. The taco was nestled in two corn tortillas. Yes a double dose of tortilla per taco. Lots of tortilla. At least it was a good tortilla. Two smallish tacos. But not bad. Priced around $7.99. Overall flavor not bad. Was not spicy.  I really have no complaints. The value was good. I just was not overwhelmed.",

One thing missing from my local spots was some decent pasta and this place hits the spot.  Very friendly GM/owner that makes sure you are taken care of.  Genuinely looking for that feedback, which is the key to the places that stick around.  I hope it does.  Definitely worth a try.  Some of what we have had most recently are the Mac N Cheese, Chicken Marsala and a few soups.  All very tasty and quite rich.  You will fill up fast and have some tasty leftovers.  As a bonus they had some nice cocktails and a solid beer selection.    While we left before they performed there were some people setting up for music, so there is that if you are into a little live music while dining.  This has inserted itself into heavy rotation.",

    "text": "My group was in town to watch some spring training games and we fell into the usual pattern of pizza, burgers. So I surprised everyone with the Perfect Pear, a restaurant that I had picked on Yelp, to change things up with some lighter fare. This is a great place for some soup, salads, sandwiches and pastas. We started with some hummus and pita slices. This could use a little bit of olive oil and seasoning but was passable. Also we enjoyed the starter of olives and pesto goat cheese, but beware that the olives have not been pitted so bite down gently.  I ordered the mushroom pasta with chicken and it was quite flavorful and filling. The wines by the glass list was nothing special but the Chardonnay that I had worked fine. The one warning that I would give is the grilled cheese sandwich; it had been over spiced with, I believe, cinnamon  and possibly nutmeg. This completely overwhelmed the sandwich to the point that you couldn't taste the cheese. Had it been my order I would have sent it back and I almost never send food back.  The PPB was a hit with our group. So if the menu sounds good to you and the pictures are enticing then I am sure that you will enjoy the PPB.",

The atmosphere is so adorable and inviting and it advertises it self as healthy comfort food, However being a super healthy eater this food tasted nothing close to clean. I got the quad city melt and chicken curry soup. The food was okay but just lacked that fresh healthy clean taste . It didn't taste like anything I couldn't get at some dive bar. It was very over priced for the quality 15$ for a sandwich and soup that was just okay. The sandwich was very mushy and tasted like it was dipped in salt and dressings just to make it taste appealing.  Just tasted greasy and over seasoned with crap. Our server was awesome but there were like 6 tables around us that were just filled with empty dishes and it made the experience feel dirty. I probably won't be back again and wish I could have enjoyed it more :(",

    "text": "Yay!! I'm a fan! I love Perfect Pair Bistro, I really wish I had one near me.  The menu is simple and healthy, easy to understand.  Happy hour wine, beer, and small plates are fair, all priced around $5, and even offered on weekends! Happy hour on cocktails are still sorta reasonable at $7.5 considering they don't skimp too much.   I've come here for an occasional dinner with my girlfriends who live in Awhatukee.  The first time I ordered a soup and quesadilla, both were so good! My most recent trip I ordered a soup and salad, again- hit it out of the park.  While these seem like easy orders, the taste and delivery is fresh and unique -- for example, my bistro salad had toasted hazelnuts, goat cheese, and a homemade vinaigrette dressing -- so different from the regular, stale, franchised taste of Paradise Bakery or Panera.   The menu is so simple to read with plenty of options. A section for sandwiches, grilled cheeses, pastas,, salads -- wide variety, but all listed separately in categories under same price.  The 1/2 and 1/2 mix is the way to go in my opinion to get a wider range of what's offered.  I cannot wait to explore more of the menu.   I've been here twice and i love the menu, ambiance, and concept for a casual bistro with great wine, beer and drink offerings. I deduct a star based on service.  Both times have been a Saturday, 6pm dinner, and we all felt rushed, despite plenty of open seating. We were a small group of girls catching up, chatting, having fun, and we were given our bill before being offered another glass of wine, or dessert, etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the staff to showcase more of the restaurant's talented menu selections.    All in all, I'll be returning.  But I just wish the service was a better part of the overall experience.",

This one is gooey and has the perfect amount of spice) 3) Pesto 4) Grilled goodness 5) Mushroom melt  Also, the sweet potato fries are so good. I don't even like sweet potato fries and will always choose regular fries over them, but not at Perfect Pear.",

It was love at first bite but I didn't want to be deceived so I decided to give it another try before writing my 5 star review.   The first time I dined here I had the Quad City Melt and the soup of the moment. Delicious! The Quad City Melt was soooooo good. I stopped in today for lunch and ordered the Fall Leaves salad with red onions and dried cranberries. Holy crap!! Try it!!   Happy hour is served daily from 11am - 6pm. Do not skip the red sangrias and the peach Margaritas, by far some of the best. $6.50 a pop, regularly priced at 7.50 and 8.50.  They feature a lunch combo (1/2 salad and 1/2 pasta, 1/2 salad and soup but you can't order a half sandwich and half salad). That's the only bummer for me, besides that. It's by far one of my favorite spots for lunch!! Oh ... if you want to add chicken to your salad know that it's baked, no or grilled. I'm not big on meat in my salad but if I do I prefer it's grilled",

I was hesitant about the house blend mix only because it had baby kale and I thought it would be too bitter. But it was perfect with the salad.

You could choose a different combination of 1/2 salad & 1/2 pasta once each day, and it would still take over eight years to complete the entire delicious 3000 meal sequence!  Included in calculations: salad with choice of greens and extra protein (or no extra protein) as well as pasta with choice of extra protein (or no extra protein).  Excluded from calculations:  gluten free pasta option since a person would probably not switch between these (as well as any other potential substitutions).  Vegetarians have 200 combinations of 1/2 salad & 1/2 pasta which is still enough to keep you occupied for quite a while.   If you are not in the mood for salad or pasta, then check out the full menu for many other options.   Plus, the menu has many options that kids would enjoy.   P.S.  It has been a while since I calculated combinations (or, God forbid, permutations). If you find an error, please let me know and I would be happy to credit you with any corrections. Thanks!",

We were promptly seated per usual, but after we were sat, we were completely ignored. Our server didn't make eye contact, didn't say hello, didn't offer us water. The sever passed us about 5 times. Several other tables were sat, including one right next to us. The server walked over and took their drink order, brought them drinks, and then took their food order. All while managing to ignore us. The server was a tall gentleman with short hair and a beard. Maybe he was threatened by us because were gay, maybe he doesn't like to serve gay people - who knows. It was very obvious we were being ignored, as he walked past us and served the table next to us. Perhaps some diversity and inclusion training is needed. As a small business in the restaurant industry this place needs to do better. My money is better spent elsewhere. We got up and walked out after being ignored for 10 minutes. No one stopped us or even seemed to care.",

I ordered the SOUTHWEST PHILLY, with  thinly sliced sirloin, sauteed mushrooms, served on toasted ciabatta roll, with caramelized onions & a green chili cheese sauce. This bread I would not call Ciabatta, it was just a soft roll that got soggy from the sauce. Totally a bummer, I barely finished a half and tossed the rest. My friend had an underwhelming salad - the BAJA LIME salad, that had dried corn, roasted red peppers, red onion, avocado,  cucumber, cilantro, feta cheese & quinoa... tossed with their lime vinaigrette.  The dressing was meager and the salad had little flavor.  I don't intend on returning, there are too many good choices out there!",

The menu is expansive and I only tried 2 items, so I can't say my experience is really indicative of what Perfect Pear has to offer. That being said, my friend and I both ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and thought they were mediocre. I had the \"perfectly grilled cheese\" and she ordered the \"bacon & jalapeno.\" The perfectly grilled cheese didn't have enough cheese, was lukewarm and the spiced pear bread disappointed. The bacon & jalapeno seemed to have one too many ingredients, although neither of us could pinpoint what should've been omitted.   The sweet potato fries were tasty, and the regular fries were good enough. Our drinks weren't too strong and were reasonably priced.   I'll give Perfect Pear Bistro another chance, and try a pasta or salad because I have to believe you other Yelpers can't all be wrong.",

Alas what was delivered to our table didn't quite match the expectations! First of all, however, the service was terrific - the young woman was friendly and quick despite looking like she was working the room on her own. We had the chicken and pear tacos, the carnitas tacos, the the grilled cheese. My son immediately complained about what was supposed to be \"perfectly grilled\" but seemed just lightly toasted. A second more grilled order was sent relatively quickly, but the sweet-savory style wasn't his, and he pushed it way to my spouse. I expected the chicken and pear tacos to have an actual taste of sweet pears, but instead found rather tasteless chunks that could have been kohlrabi instead of fruit. The chunky pieces of bacon added some nice smoked saltiness. The carnitas (my go-to dish wherever it is served) and the other incredients were \"OK\". Having had some \"real\" tacos the day before at a small mom and pop Mexican restaurant made me feel a bit sorry for the Perfect Pear.  We were at the location off University - perhaps the other location has better execution - or perhaps it was an off day. But I think I will pass on the next visit.",

He asked for some salsa hoping it would help with the dry pork  The server threw the small amount of salsa in a container on the table at him.  It almost slid off the table.  The salsa was dry and added nothing to his already dry sandwich.   He did not finish the sandwich and the server just took it away not asking if our meal was satisfactory.

The chicken was tender and juicy, the aioli was on point, the bacon was crispy, and the bread was warm and soft; everything about it was amazing. I am probably going to go back tomorrow to try the BLT, but honestly, everything sounds SO good.   Oh and props to the server that let the bartender know I was seated at the bar! The bartender came over immediately even though she was swamped. Thumbs up on customer service!! :\")",

Decor is nice, chill, and quiet when we went on a Friday night even though there were other groups of people there having a good time too. Was kinda confused on why they sent out the soup/salad with the main dishes though... but I think that's just how the menu is setup? I ordered G'Mas Mac 'n' Cheese w/bacon on top which was good (can't go wrong with mac 'n' cheese though)! Their Iced Watermelon Black Tea was good too.  Service was slow when we went, but our waitress was nice~ if you're in the mood for a quiet place to eat by yourself or with your family, it's a nice place to go to in this very robust area.",

Tonight I ordered the Perfect Pear Classic salad, a favorite of mine.   Greens are crisp and lightly coated with vinaigrette.  The dressing is so subtle that it appears there is no dressing until you dig in.  Then the delightful flavor hits your tongue, and it is yummy!  Pieces of fresh pear, Gorgonzola, red onion and hazelnuts fill out the salad.  Fabulous.  Hubby had Grandma's Mac and Cheese, his favorite.  It is a very generous portion of pasta, covered with a creamy cheese sauce and sprinkles of fresh bacon.  He cleaned the plate.  We split a side order of pear bread which is absolutely delicious.  Here is just a hint of cinnamon which gives it added depth.  No butter needed.  We'll be back soon.",

The one consistent downside: Sooooooper slow service - I've been four or five times now and Every.Single.Time you either wait a really long time to be waited on at all, and/or once you do order, your food/beverage takes an inordinately long time to get to you. I don't know if it's because they under-staff or if it's because the staff is just not totally on the ball, but even though we love eating and drinking there, we avoid going if we have any kind of time-restriction at all. A 30 minute \"let's have one drink before the movie\" can inadvertently take 45 minutes to order, drink the drink, wait for the check, etc.",

However we also got some kind of cheesy chipotle bread appetizer that was pretty unappetizing. We each only took one bite and my husband declared that it tasted like something you'd get from the freezer section at Wal Mart. We sent it back.

    "text": "After driving past this charming little place for a few years, my husband and I finally decided to check it out for our date night. Don't be put off by the name like I was- they do have light and healthy options but they can also throw down some amazing mac and cheese dishes and bacon is one of their staple ingredients. The scent of caramelized bacon was actually the first thing I smelled upon them j entering. Loved the interior that has a very modern look and a wall full of live plants (I'm a plant lover)...We started off with the lavender honey martini (I forgot the name) and it was heavenly. The perfect combination of flavors and was definitely not watered down, which was nice. My hubby ordered the iced green tea and went through three servings of it because it was so good. To start, we ordered the bacon and Brie crostini which came deliciously melted in a bed of caramelized sauce. We also had the g-ma mac and rosemary asparagus pasta, and both tasted great and the flavors were well rounded and tasted phenomenal! This will definitely be a regular part of our date night rotation.",

    "text": "We've tried this place a couple times now & it's been an excellent experience each time. Everything we've tasted has been absolutely delicious. We love the combination of flavors in all of their dishes - if you like butternut squash, pears & bacon, this is the place for you. I highly recommend the green chili mac & cheese. Normally I don't go the mac & cheese route, but it's just the right amount of spice & an elevated dish like you'd expect from 5 star dining. Service is also quick & friendly. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I give Perfect Pear a solid 4+ stars for their food.  So far I have only taken out, but enjoyed everything thoroughly.  The carnitas in the tacos were fabulous.  Way better than I expected.  Tuscan Rigatoni and Athena's Garden pastas were fantastic.  Grandma's Mac was just shy of great.  Cabo Cobb salad is awesome too.  They were really nice about putting in an order at 8:59:47 on a Friday when they close at 9.  I am not sure why they close at 9 on a Friday... I feel like if they went with late night service, they could potentially become the type of place that cooks and servers from other restaurants in Tempe/Chandler/Ahwatukee go to after their dinner shift.  The atmosphere is really nice.  I will be dining in soon, I look forward to trying many more delicious items off their menu.",
