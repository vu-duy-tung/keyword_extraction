However I came around 6:30 and the poke station was a mess!!! I could not believe my eyes. They were rolling the burritos on the counter filled with toppings that had spilled ! There was literally toppings everywhere that could have easily been wiped up. There was shrimp next to the seaweed salad, mango spilled everywhere in between the topping bins. I hope management sees this so they can be more cautious of the mess! Especially the start of dinner they should have a clean station.",

My first thought was subway but for sushi. But as I got closer to the ordering area, it became more than that. The theme is eat healthy, eat local and eat raw. The staff was great at welcoming us and helping us with the ordering process. Pokitrition was started by ASU grads (WooHoo... Go Devils) and they serve Hawaiian inspired sushi bowls and burritos that you customize yourself. You can choose from salmon, ahi, spicy tuna and cooked shrimp for your protein. Then you have a base (salad or rice) and toppings you can add to complete your meal. Lol... I think I picked every topping available just to experience it all. The bowl was supper fresh, light and delicious. I was pretty blown away by all the flavors. Even my buddy who is super picky went for the octopus and loved it. I really enjoyed my first time trying poke and would come back again. Here's to new experiences!",

My roommate got an awesome-looking seaweed-wrapped burrito.   Next time I plan to try the California style, which is just crab instead of fish and two bucks cheaper.

I always get the sushi wrap (burrito) with spicy tuna, salmon, spicy crab, and whatever topping I feel like stuffing inside that day haha. The only issue I have, which isn't a big deal, is I wish there was a bit more rice and tougher seaweed to hold the burrito together better. It would also help break up textures a little bit more as sometimes it just get pretty mushy. But the flavor is there, and it's amazing. I come here a couple of times a month now with friends and they all enjoy it too :)",

Unlike other poke shops, Pokitrition uses quality FRESH tuna and salmon. You won't find any ice crystals on this fish! I was amazed at the number of sauces available and the variety of toppings too. I opted for a poke wrap with half marinated tuna and half regular tuna. The poke was then mixed in a small bowl with some of their Korean sauce and put onto my seasoned rice/seaweed wrapper. Then came the jalapeno, 2 scoops of spicy krab salad, mango, crispy onions, chives, cucumber, and watermelon radish. At the register, they had samples of their sweet mango black tea. Loved it, so I grabbed a full size one. My order total came out to $13.94. To me, that's incredibly reasonable considering my poke wrap was HUGE and I got a large specialty tea. I honestly can't wait to come back, I am so impressed. I gotta tell all my friends, if you want good poke, this is where you have to go!",

This one probably still ranks at the top- It seems to be the freshest and the the flavors of everything are awesome. I love how they mix the fish with the sauce, separately, I feel like this really adds to the taste. The only cons I've found is they have totally changed their portion sizes since they opened - in particular really skimping on rice, and it's just not as filling as It used to be. The miso soup is worth It for $1.50, the iced tea not so much (sickeningly sweet). I'll be keep my eye out on new shops popping up but will continue to be semi-regular at this one, for now!!",

I'm glad I decided to take a chance and venture into Pokitrition. The one thing I look for when I go to a place that serves raw fish is odor. I was glad that Pokitrition did not have a fishy smell at all. The menu is simple and straight forward and the staff is amazing. I got a poke bowl with brown rice. For my protein I chose marinated ahi tuna and regular ahi tuna with sriracha aioli. I got seaweed salad, spicy crab, scallions, masago and sesame seeds as well. The fish was fresh, delicate and flavorful. Loved what I got and I'm curious to try other items on their menu.",

Not only was he generous with the portion sizes, but he arranged each and every piece of my wrap beautifully. When faced with the daunting task of rolling the entire bad boy up, he rolled up his sleeves and assured me not to worry. A True hero that we all need, but don't deserve. A very accommodating host, Andrew should definitely receive praise as well as promotion for his revolutionary service for he created a True masterpiece. Andrew truly placed every component and ingredient into the wrap as if they were his own children. The most enjoyable part of it all was the experience of Andrews flavors exploding into my mouth and being able to taste each and every flavor of andrew's children as the intense sensation flooded every part of my pallet. A truly sensational dish and an experience I will never forget. Thank you, andrew.",

But a Chandler friend insisted that Poktrition was a quick fix for my Poke withdrawal. It was like a raw fish Chipotle. You get a bowl or wrap (large hand roll) with rice, protein (raw salmon or ahi), and your choice of add-ins. It was FRESH and tasty, but i did feel jipped on the rice (I got the bowl), and felt it was over-priced ($17?!) I ordered salmon, spicy ahi, guac, seaweed salad, edemame and crunchy onion...Maybe i got too much \"mush\", but i felt it needed a better texture than mush. I just need more RICE! Which is why I will update this WHEN I go back. Hopefully the wrap will sooth the Poke handroll fix, or I will have to ask for more rice in the bowl. It's good, and worth another chance.",

The rice is cooked pretty well, however if you eat the poke burrito, it's a lot less flavorful because if you were to add sauce to it, it'll kinda lose its shape!   The poke bowl is more worth it in my opinion, but I'm the kind of guy that likes to mix everything up after awhile of eating my bowl. The sauces are very normal and you definitely tried something similar to it at other poke places.   The portions I will say are quite small. So I wasn't a fan of that. Also, this is not really a problem but it always seems like there's a million employees working there at a time, when there's only like 5 customers in the poke joint.  The reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because it's good, but is it really different from any poke joint like ahipoki? Not really.",

The drink options are also delicious, along with sodas they have iced teas and japanese sodas.",

I you have always wanted, but have not had a \"Poke (sushi) Burrito\" you need to add this place to your bucket list!! No joke! I had a Poke Bowl ($9.95) includes 2 generous scoops of protein (aka fish or tofu) $1.95 will get you an extra scoop! I had a scoop of tuna and 2 salmon. You can add your 'sauce' they have several options for any pallet. You choose 2 sides, seaweed salad and/or crab salad and toppings, they have several! Think of Chipotle style ordering style. The restaurant is VERY clean and the raw fish is kept to the correct temperature! The staff is also very friendly and encourages questions from guests who are unfamiliar with 'Poke'. This is a fun restaurant to take friends and family, or when you are looking for something new & out of the ordinary!!",

    "text": "I swear these poke places just keep getting better!!! I looooved Poketrition because they have the option to not only get a bowl, but also a burrito style poke wrap.   The wrap is seaweed and rice, and they put a really yummy seasoning on it. I added tuna, sweet and spicy sauce, crab mix, onions, edemame, roe, watermelon radish, cucumber, and wontons. The wontons gave the wrap a really great texture!   The staff was super friendly also! They made sure we understood the process and all of our options. What's great is that they have a cali-style option where you can skip the main protein and still get everything else, which I think is a nice touch! They have lots of yummy, healthy drinks as well.  This is probably my new favorite poke place! Definitely check it out!",

Need to ask for more of that sauce in the future as that mix of sesame oil, rice vinegar and gochujang is just deadly when combo'd with poki.  Go to order (Spi-Sea variant)  Marinated Tuna Chojang Onion Jalapeno Seaweed Spicy Surimi Mango Green Onion Wonton Strips  I don't even get sushi anymore as this place does the trick in a fast-casual format. For $10 plus tax I don't think you can match the taste or price. Only thing I wish for is that they have a location closer to Camelback so I don't have to trek as far for my fix.   Drinks are awesome (Cold brew mango black tea is a must try) and staff are great. They deliver now too!   Def check them out.",

First impression of the place is that it is very clean and I love how simple their concept is. The shop is very welcoming and I was greeted right away. In California we have a bunch of Poke places and I've tried a lot of them so I know what good poke is supposed to be like.   So first thing is that it is basically a very similar concept as Chipotle where you pick what you want in your bowl/salad.wrap. They have so much selection here and it works like an assembly line. The employees were very friendly and made sure that they made it just the way that I like it. I went with the rice bowl and chose salmon and tuna with sriracha aioli (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.COM&s=922b00e6ee5202c95e27b97f5b810dde60b61b547af64d68b87db899b0b4839c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.COM</a>) and a bunch of other sides. My boyfriend got the poke wrap and was so excited to eat it. Let me tell you....seriously for a place out in Arizona I was shocked as to how bomb it was. The fish was fresh and all the flavors were ON POINT. I personally love the aioli because it is a bit creamy, but the sesame shoyu my boyfriend got was pretty good too. Overall our meal was very nice and fresh and delicious.   I see why there would be so many good reviews, this place definitely lives up to all the good yelp reviews. For the price for the bowl and wrap (I underestimated it, I WAS SO FULL but kept eating) came out to be around $20 something and it was so worth it. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE!!! Will definitely be coming back again when I come visit from California again !",

Essentially, you pick what kind of medium you want your piece of heaven (sushirito, salad, or bowl) and you pick your main meat, your seasoning, and then toppings. I went with the Yuzu Salmon Bowl and I loved every bite. The ingredients were fresh, even the salmon even though Arizona is a land locked state. I am a firm believer that we eat food with our eyes. The poki bowl was delicious but also beautiful in color and arrangement. The gentleman who created my bowl put lots of care into its creation and I was thoroughly pleased. The lads behind the counter are extremely courteous and patient. Bottom line, I'll be back whenever I find myself in Phoenix.",

First off, the Poke craze has taken over AZ and everyone is coming in to the market. I wasn't sure this would be better or the same as the competitors but oh my goodness, this takes the cake!  I went on their grand opening day but have gone back several times because of how amazing their food is.  You can choose a bowl or a wrap which is great. All their fish is flown in fresh daily from Honolulu and you can taste the difference. I have had some of the poke from local locations and the fish is generally frozen first and then thawed. NOT THIS PLACE, IT IS SO FRESH!!!   They have a machine that flattens out their rice to make an easy to assemble wrap. They offer a guacamole house spread on the wrap and I'm letting you know, this makes it even better! As you go through, you choose how many scoops of fish to add, vegetables and little extras. This is the only place that I know that offers watermelon radish and it is amazing. They also have watermelon juice for sale. The wrap was the most perfect wrap I have ever had and some of the freshest fish to boot!  The restaurant is small but there is usually enough seating for everyone. Tons of free parking and a wonderful addition to the area.   I highly recommend that you try this place, even if the name is a pun on words, you will love it!",

They have a great variety of toppings and mix-ins to go with the fish and the base (salad, rice, wrap). The Sriracha sauce was awesome!  In short, I'll have to make more trips out to Chandler to have excuses to come back to Poketrition.  Update 5/7/17.  I've been wanting to go back again, and finally was able to yesterday.

It was my first time and the girl seem very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name.   I got their sushi burrito wrap and it's the best thing ever! This creation is so cool. Raw fish tasted very fresh, their sauces is the best and the wrap itself is very big. It can be share for two if you dont eat allot.   Anyways I would definitely be back again!",

I might as well head out and eat some Nemos before running errands. ;)  Pokitrition is a decent place. It's brightly lit, decor is modern, the staff is super friendly and informative, and the eats are clean! Toppings are plentiful and it's all very fresh.  I especially like the mango. I also enjoyed the big chunks of fresh fish and the jalapenos. There doesn't  seem to be a soda fountain so you're stuck buying bottled drinks. They do have a home brewed iced tea that's strong.  I like it when my drinks can deliver a kick.  This place also serves Poke Wraps aka sushi burritos.  With this place being so close to home, I can see myself stopping in here; especially since it's so close to spin class! It starts at $9.95.",

I'm so glad I made it to their grand opening for the buy one get one (: I was worried they would run out because they did say \"while supplies last\" but I did and my friends and I were part of the few last people they serve. They gave us free swag for baring the burden of telling people behind us to leave which is pretty cool of them.   I feel like for about 10 bucks you get a lot of food and on top of that, the food is good and fresh! Love the decor of the place, very simple and modern. The staff is extremely friendly and even though they were probably tired from working all day for their grand opening, they were very attentive and did not rush us at all.   To be honest I was a little scared going there late on their grand opening because I didn't want the leftover scraps but it was nothing like that.   Definitely will come back when I'm in the area.",

I had the salmon and marinated tuna and majority of the toppings. With a miso soup and mango tea. I was very surprised and hate to say it, but my burrito was bland.  probably will ask for extra spicy mayo next time. But everything tasted fresh. The burrito was huge chipotle sized. Miso soup was really good. Not salty at all. The tea was a bit strong for my taste buds. But I'm not a big black tea drinker.  Overall the experience was great. I don't think it's fair to rate them low just because my taste buds weren't excited.",

It's like a chipotle but for poke, it was fast and efficient. You went down the line saying what you wanted and they made it right in front of you and the staff was nice all the way down to the register. The place has a modern feel and there was plenty of complimentary water, forks, knives, spoons, and napkins. I have to come back.",

They give you the option of adding hot cheetos. My first order was perfect or maybe I just got lucky? I got the sushi burrito with hot cheetos, salmon & ahi tuna (tossed in sriracha aoli), red onions, seaweed salad, spicy crab, masago, avocado, and crunchy onions. Yummy in my tummy!",

The four just wanted to bring cool, fresh, local food to the Valley. They fly in fish fresh from Hawaii on the daily and have become infamous for their....sushi burritos!  Coolest part about the sushi burrito? You get to customize it.  I ordered the marinated tuna, siracha aioli, ponzo sauce, seaweed, and spicy crab. I call this one the MerBear. Oh, and did I just name every single favorite thing about Japanese food? Yes! This made me especially happy because oh my gosh, this burrito was so big and delicious. I probably ate it too fast and furiously, but no regrets! How could I not fall in love at first bite? If you guys are in Chandler, Tempe, or just in Arizona, definitely check Pokitrition out.",

Those toppings being cilantro, mango, and watermelon radish. Add any of these to your meal and you wont be disappointed.

Good fish should not smell.  I had my bowl, was not impressed and I wrote the place off.  Today needed a quick lunch and was in the area and decided to give them another chance.  Walked in, same awful fish smell.  And this time my salmon tastes fishy too.  With the wonderful poke places opening in the valley, this place should really reconsider their business plan.  They have way less ingredient options from the other pokes places too.  Definitely off my list for good.",

The line looked a little daunting when I first entered for a late lunch but the servers were very efficient (and friendly) so it was amazingly fast to get through.   Definitely a great place for a quick, healthy meal with impressive variety for the amount of space available in the preparation area.   The ingredients were fresh and had good mouth feel (the fish really is sushi grade). I have never had a poke with a base other than rice so I gave the salad base a try. It did not seem like my ingredient choices were the best fit for that option so the next time I will either ask the servers for their recommendations as to what compliments a poke salad or maybe try a wrap instead.   The price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. The seats were full when I got in line but there were some available after paying (which was just as efficient as the preparation line). There is also outside seating on either side of the building and parking should not be an issue.   Thanks to the owners for adding to the diversity of Chandler and to Yelp for telling me about it!",

Don't forget the mango and watermelon radish toppings you will not be disappointed. I still have to go back and try the poke wrap which looks absolutely satisfying and more than filling. You just can't go wrong here. The only downside for me is that they are only in Chandler and I am in the west valley so my visits aren't often. Nonetheless an absolute treat every time I have the opportunity to oblige. Just look at the detail and make some time to check out these friendly folks at Pokitrition... Mac 5 star approved!!!!",

    "text": "This was my first experience at the restaurant. The guy at the counter explained that you order like chipotle. I started creating my bowl and chose the spicy ahi and the marinated ahi. Luckily before I finished ordering the person behind me asked what the marinade was. I'm highly allergic to nuts and would have no way of knowing that the ahi was marinated in nuts had the person behind me not asked. Nut allergies are extremely common and are normally noted on the menu because of the severe reaction people who are allergic have. The restaurant had plenty of signs for uncooked fish illness. There should definitely be something that says marinated in nuts. I created a new bowl that was nut free but I'm concerned about cross contamination because there set up wasn't the cleanest.",

    "text": "Feeling #BLESSED to have Pokitrition so close by. I literally screamed when I first came across their \"coming soon\" signs, and when they opened, they did not disappoint!   The first thing I loved about em was that they fly in their ahi tuna from Hawaii, Honolulu Fish Company to be exact - a ton of points towards freshness and authenticity! Being given the choice of a wrap (sushi burrito) and a bowl is awesome too and helps keep things from getting boring if you want to be a beast and eat poke several times a week!  I had my first taste of the build-your-own-poke bowl last year when ahipoki was the only joint in town. It was really good to me back then up until I had the religious experience of having authentic poke during a trip to Hawaii. Now it doesn't super measure up. Thankfully, with Pokitrition's fresh ingredients, tasty marinades and Honolulu tuna, I can enjoy and reminisce about that real island poke.  Also love that they have a loyalty punch card because I can't fill it up fast enough! Service is fast, friendly and personable- they have often remembered me coming in before :) Plus it always feels good supporting a local AZ-based business in my own neighborhood. See you tomorrow Pokitrition!!!",

I typically frequent Poke Bar down the street because I'm familiar with the name (due to the one by my job) but I am never completely satisfied at that location. So looking for a change, I hopped on Yelp and found this lovely place! Let me just say, this place blows Poke Bar out of the water! The rice, tuna and salmon were so fresh and buttery, the jalapenos were fresh and spicy, the sriracha aioli was delicious - everything was perfect. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that they also serve sushi burritos so I will be back to try that next! So happy to have found a new poke spoke, and will be telling all of my friends about this place.   I wish I could rate this place 10/10, that's definitely what they deserve!",

I like how they offer a rice bowl, salad and a wrap, usually Poke places only have rice bowl or a salad.  While I liked the flavor of their marinated tuna, the portion is lacking. We ordered a total of 3 bowls, 2 regular bowls and a kid's bowl. Unfortunately, they were all the same size. Kids size. Luckily my 6 year old enjoyed his Poke Bowl and says it tasted fresh. We will probably be back again, hopefully by then portions won't be kid sized!",

This is just made just 2-3times bigger in terms of size. Now the real problem is how they can make it tasty. Well... they did a hack of a job.

It was pretty busy when we got here around 7 and the atmosphere felt chaotic to me. The employees were great and took care of us despite the busy crowd.   The setup was familiar except the menu was off to the side of the initial ordering location, so I moved a bit to the side to see what was different than other places. 2 scoops is $10 with additional toppings extra. I got my standard half half bowl with white rice and greens and spicy tuna and salmon. They also have sushiritos which was new to me. The toppings are similar and I got edamame, cucumber, spicy crab salad, regular crab salad, jalapenos, red and green onions, and crunchy toppings. I got a mix of their Sriracha aioli and sesame shoyu sauce.   When I started eating it, I could taste the mayo from the aioli and it was strong to me, I didn't like it. I added soy sauce but I think that made things worse. There was something off about my combo bowl but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what else it was. Usually, poke blends together pretty well but it didn't here. It seems like I'm in the minority because of the high ratings here, and I'm glad for that because that means other people have had great experiences here. I will still venture and try out more poke places but I will be more humble about my expectations.",

You can get a bowl or wrap, and a wrap is basically a one big sushi roll. It's amazing! All the toppings are wrapped in rice and seaweed is on the outside. I recommending going light on the sauce otherwise it can get soggy quick. There's so much flavor in all the toppings anyway that I prefer it NOT drenched in sauce.  If you aren't a seaweed person get the bowl - in which case you you can also do salad instead of rice, or if you want both you can do half/half. They also offer spicy crab meat here where most other places just have regular. It's sooo good! They have a loyalty punch card so after 9-10 you can get a free bowl or wrap.",

    "text": "I keep on reading the name of this place as Poke Stop lol. Don't worry you won't find any Magikarp on this menu! This place differs from other poke places in that they offer sushi burritos/sushi wraps. Protein selections are a little less diverse than at other places but the fish is fresh.   I had a sushi wrap with marinated tuna, salmon, and a plethora of toppings including diced mango, watermelon radish and masago. The marinated tuna is marinated in their ponzu sauce, and the yuzu dressing that they use is more on the tart side than super sweet which I liked. Also note that they will not make your wrap with brown rice. I think it's probably because the brown rice won't stick to the seaweed wrap like white rice does.  I loved the sushi wrap. It was hearty, filling, and I loved the mix of flavors and textures. The rice was soft and fluffy and it was a good amount of food for lunch. While the fish was fresh it did have a bit of a sticky texture to me.   They don't have a soda fountain but they do have a varied selection of drinks including cold pressed watermelon juice, Hawaiian soda made with coffee extract, Press cold brew coffee and freshly brewed iced tea.  Service was superb. The young woman and gentleman working here were awesome.   Overall it's a good place to get your poke fix! 4.5/5.",

    "text": "Have you ever been to one of those places where after you ate your meal you kept thinking about how good it was all day long and wishing you had more of it when it wore off? To me, this is one of those places.   I was intrigued as soon as I walked in and liked the setup where you choose your ingredients and watch them make your order right in front of you. You could choose a bowl or a wrap. I liked the looks of the wraps other people were getting so I chose that. They're all the same price not including add-ons so that made the choosing easy because I didn't have to consider whether one was more or less expensive.   The choices were wonderful. You start with two proteins. I chose salmon and shrimp although I'm sure I would have been happy with anything they offered. Other add-in choices include sides, toppings, sauces, all of which are integrated into the bowl or wrap, not set on the side. I would have gotten avocado but it was $1.75 extra and I felt like that upped the price a little more than I wanted.  One of the sides was shredded crab and it was a perfectly delicious choice.   If I were going to tweak it at all it would have been to ask for a little more cilantro since I love it. And I had no idea what the three sauces tasted like so I just had to pick one randomly. I didn't want something too spicy  and just did an eenie meenie miney moe between the other two choices. I don't know whether they offer samples but if they do that might have helped. The place was pretty crazy busy on a Saturday afternoon about 1 p.m. so I didn't want to make anyone behind me wait in line while I took too long to make my choices.  When I looked at everything they offered I think there would have been no way I could have ended up with something I wouldn't have liked even if I had told them to put whatever they wanted on it.   The wrap looked so huge at the end that I was only planning on eating half of it and taking the other half with me to eat later. That just didn't happen. It was so scrumptious and went down so easily that when I finished the first half I moved on to the other half without a second thought. I wasn't sorry. I can always go back, and I plan to.   The employees were super nice, greeted me in spite of being busy, cheerfully responded to my questions and choices, told me to enjoy and checked if I had enjoyed the wrap as I left. They showed genuine interest in happy customers. That's how it should be but some places you feel like the server is just being nice to you for a good tip, like we can't tell the difference between real interest and phony niceness.  The total price of the wrap was about $11 with tax, but it was as huge as a large burrito so I felt that it was well worth it, not to mention the great quality of the ingredients which made every bite a taste delight.  They don't skimp on the quantity either. I don't know what the nutritional information would be on it, something I might want to look up, but I felt like I got a good portion of protein and greens by the end. It was wrapped in seaweed like a sushi roll but much easier to eat. The seaweed was very tender, not chewy like some sushi.  I'm definitely hooked.",

The restaurant want you to employ their rewards program but when you want to redeem your points there are stipulations. For instance, I often dine at this restaurant for lunch since it's within walking distance to my job. I've accumulated enough points for 2 rewards. When trying to redeem the awards, the cashier said \"oh ok well actually you can only use one reward at a time.\" I ask him to show me the clause where it says that and when he couldn't produce, he said he'll give it to me but it'll have to be a second transaction. Huh??? I didn't understand that, nor did I want to continue holding up a long line so I just said forget it.  Word of advice...if you are asking people to sign up for your reward program make sure all i's are dotted and t's crosses so it's not a case by case basis. I'll move on to Chandler Poke Bowl.",

It's really up to preference. I suggest that you fill the wrap with more crunches for it to have more texture. I prefer my wrap with less of the other toppings, because I feel like it can bee too much when you take a bite. It is different from the bowl, since you can pick and choose what you'll have in one bite. Both of choices are super filling so no need to compare which option might have more food.  My favorite protein is their marinated tuna and salmon. Even though the marinated tuna is mixed in with sesame shoyu sauce, I still add on the yuzu ponzu sauce to it. The mix is still very good! The one last thing I would recommend is their cold brew tea! Both green and black tea are to die for! Their tea has a strong tea flavor, and I personally love to drink tea, which is probably why I like it.  Don't let the lunch or dinner rush scare you away. Although the line might seem long (to the door), they get to you pretty quick. And that's not the fascinating part. The best part is that the staff is still nice and super friendly during the rush! The staff here is so FRIENDLY, which makes the experience here so much better.",

I had the aioli and it was good but if I'm there for a salad, I don't want to smother it in mayo. Staff was nice.  I'd call this a chipotle clone but with 3 day old fish and less options.

I try something different every time and have not been disappointed yet. Great options for a low carb or paleo family member as they can order the salad. If you can't make up your mind, don't do the half and half. It just gets messy. Opt for the rice bowl and try the salad another time. It's an option for indecision, but I don't think it is as enjoyable is totally committing to one or the other. Just do the classic bowl if you're not sure.  Regardless of what you order, I do suggest going for the rice seasoning. It adds so much to the dish. I love their sweet green tea. Has a bite, which is why I order it sweetened. The black is amazing both ways. Recently took a friend who is currently low carb and low sugar while she is leading up to her wedding, she completely fell in love with this place.  It is getting popular, so don't freak out if there is a line. The staff is friendly and quick. Go for the reward card, you'll be back!",

Ever since the first time I tried it, I've been absolutely hooked on it and have not had a single bad experience and the food was never disappointing despite my high expectations for it.  I will put it out there that I have not had any other Poke before trying out Pokitrition, but this place is just so amazing that it's hard for me to want to try others.  I legitimately do not understand how this place keeps fish so fresh in Arizona... I've occasionally had some good fresh fish while getting sushi at places like Osaka Japanese Grill, but even on its best day, it didn't compare to how the fish is here every day.  Legit good, will keep coming back for sure.",

Everything looked old, like it had been sitting there all day, not very clean or fresh. Plain tuna tasted disgusting (and this is my third poke spot try this month I know what good tuna tastes like) I feel like I wasted $11. Cilantro had yellowed and gone bad. I feel like nobody there really cares about keeping the food fresh. Also the tuna looked odd, and smelled off. Like it was covered in an oil slick (look). Toppings are limited choices. Save your money and go elsewhere, came because of the good reviews and I feel misled.  Update: The owner does have good business practice. Upon reading my review they messaged me, apologized and offered a free bowl or wrap if I returned. Not sure I will go back, but I have a LOT of respect for any business that puts the customer first and tries to handle complaints respectfully and with hospitality, hence I will give them two stars instead of my original one star because I appreciate any business that makes an effort to right a wrong and puts the customer first.",

OMG all so good! I know I've seen tons of IG pix of sushi burritos so I was eager to try it. Next visit will be a new protein combo in a bowl. Maybe brown rice. Samples of mango or peach green teas were passed around while we waited in line. Those too were tasty. I'm excited for the next round!",

First, there may or may not be a line - if so, it generally moves quickly and they will get you on your way. However, the portion sizes are very large.  I generally like the poke bowl - I have had the \"burrito\"/wrap and it is good too - just another way to eat it. I prefer the bowl though - as the wrap becomes a little harder to eat.  Anyway - I like the spicy tuna, and the spicy crab is awesome. Love the seaweed salad and the toppings.  Unlike other places I have been - they are very friendly here and quick to help out. As well - loved that my sushi rice was still warm (as opposed to other places where I have had dried out crunchy rice) and I love the shoyu sauce.  Overall - very easy concept and delicious.",

This place does not provide the full sit down restaurant ambiance but compares more to how you would order and eat at chipotle. You order either a poke bowl or wrap (which is like a sushi burrito and is so flavorful) the worker adds the ingredients you ask for and makes it in front of you. They have a really cool machine that flattens the rice on seaweed to wrap up your poke! They have so many options! I choose a wrap with ahi tuna, salmon, with crab, seaweed salad, siracha aioli, cucumber, watermelon radish, edamame, and wontons! The wontons added the crunchy factor that took it to the next level! I recommend it! We also got a tea which was delicious as well! Cute on the inside, not very big, but we ordered got our food quick, sat and ate!

This is about same price as AP, but less protein options, that ok, since i can get MANGO on it ,, and 2 scoops krab stuff without the added dollar fee... Also Pokitrition seemed like the portion size was bigger...

They have a nice variety of fish that you can have two scoops of and in addition to two scoops of any combo of krab, spicy krab, or seaweed salad plus other dry toppings. This was a really fun experience and the employees were very friendly. Also the water has cucumbers in it - a nice touch!!",

The rice was hot and fresh I definitely had no complaints about that. Overall there price on a bowl is worth it for all that seafood and veggies. It's around a $10 bowl plus tax. I will definitely be back for another round!",

This poke shop is special because they let  you get order the colorful poke bowls in Sushi burrito style like infamous Sushiritto in SF. Since, SF is 12 hrs away pokitrition will do.  They have two unique machines that help spread rice on the seaweed. They are offering a special right now they have Hot cheetos to sprinkle on your wrap for a fiery instagram-friendly poke sushi burrito!   When you move in line you can select different toppings like seaweed, furikake. I liked the sesame and ginger sauce for my protein. Avocado is $1 extra. My choice of protein was Salmon and Tuna which were very fresh. The fish is shipped from Hawaii and the quality is very good.   I think they need hand menus because your caught off guard when it's your turn to order. There's not that much time to decide. Overall, I would come back. The sushi burritoes seem to have more food than the bowl. They were a little slow today and they forgot to give me wasabi for my order but this is a nice place for a quick lunch. Bonus they have fivestars to collect points   Overall: 4",

Pokitrition is a local poke shop in Chandler. Poke is a traditional Hawaiian dish, think sushi in a bowl. Mixing in their own local twist to this Hawaiian meal is what makes Pokitrition so incredibly good! They focus on a build-your-own system. When I went, I got the original poke bowl with both salmon and ahi tuna. Pick whatever toppings you want, but I recommend the radish, masago, and ginger.   I can't wait to come back and try the sushi burrito!",

Trying all the different restaurants that pop up has become a sort of foodie quest.  I have seen the sushi burrito pictures on my Instagram for quite sometime, however being a CenPho girl, I rarely venture to either side of the valley for fast casual type food. So, having an occasion to be on the East side, Pokitrition was immediately added to the itinerary.   My friend and I arrived early, right before what appeared to be a lunch rush. The menu is easy to understand (pick your base, proteins, sauces, and add ins) and labeled for gluten free and a few other allergens.   Obviously, I went for the burrito base, as that is what makes this place different and added spicy tuna, seaweed salad, onions, edamame, avocado, masago and a few other things. Immediately, I could see how this place did not skimp on portions!   My burrito, pictured, was amazing and definitely enough food for two people who aren't starving. The process seemed like it takes more time, particularly of you order a burrito than other poke bowl places and they were out of kombucha, but those 'complaints' were minor.  I cannot wait until the 16th Street location opens!",

When opened the bag, the smell was so bad that I thought it was our garbage when the lid was lifted. Several of us smelled it and it was rotten. The salmon was brown on the edges. We took it back in in a zip lock bag and explained our story, they knew us from all of our business. They didn't check out the bag we brought back for the powerful smell, their stock, nothing! Just shrugged, said 'sorry'. Clearly they just didn't care. Spoiled, raw fish can be a big deal.  We'll never go back.",

The last time we went back i finally tried the Sushi Burrito. I mean, I love a good steak and chicken burrito from Chipotle, but this is the best burrito I have ever tasted. If you are a fan of sushi and seaweed you def have to try this. Will blow your mind! Can't wait to try the Hot Cheeto dust they have for these burritos next time.

Large selection of toppings for you to choose from, and when you feel like you're tired of the combination you've been getting, you can change it up and get a whole new, yet still great flavor.   Since they first opened, they've also added online ordering! So if you're in a rush or want to beat the line, put in your order online and skip the line entirely to pick up your food.   They've also been voted \"Best Poke\" of Phoenix in 2017 in the Phoenix New Times publication--and rightly so. Hands down my favorite restaurant, and favorite place to get poke at in Arizona. 10/10 recommend.  *word is that they're gonna be opening another location in Uptown Phoenix sometime in the Spring of this year too!",

We shared a Sushi Burrito (Marinated Tuna, Cooked Shrimp, Sriracha Aioli, Seaweed Salad, Surimi Crab, Mango, Avocado, and Crispy Wonton Strips) and a Yuzu Salmon Bowl.  Pros: Their menu offered several familiar options for the fish, seasonings, and sides to satisfy most any fan of Poke. The quality of the fish and the other ingredients was good and everything tasted fresh. All of the ingredients worked very well with each other and the flavor of the fish came through quite nicely. The portions in the burrito were generous and were as much as could possibly fit in a rolled up sheet of nori. Service was prompt and very courteous despite the restaurant being somewhat busy on a Friday evening.  Cons: The only downside is that this type of food can be a little pricey; the tab for the two of us came to a little over $30. This is to be expected for Poke, though, and is not a True negative provided you're aware of this in advance.",

Lids for the fish were all also dirty and laying stacked on the dirty counter. 2. Quality. The quality of the food was also questionable- the spicy crab salad looked to be sitting out for hours and discolor, the regular crab was empty and not being replaced, avocado brown, and radishes were completely green and didn't look ripe. In addition I haven't felt well all night after my burrito. 3. Consistently. The burrito was far less quality than previous where the rice machine was erratic and very little fish was given. 4. Customer service. The last few times I've been in, the normal friendly helpful crew is gone and instead they are much less caring to be there or help.  It appears the former attention to every detail has been lost. Please bring back the immaculate, consistent, top quality place you used to be! It was truly the best in town!",

I enjoyed the sushiritto alot! I ate it all on the spot and the Mexican coke was a refreshing compliment to the sushiritto. Only complaint was that they ran out of octopus and marinated tuna, but that's probably because the place was so packed they ran out of it. I will DEFINITELY be coming back!",

    "text": "Can't give this place enough stars! My mom and I had a lunch date here when they first opened. It was her first time trying poke, my millionth time, and we both absolutely loved it! They were jam packed since they're a new place, but they handled the crowd quickly and professionally. All of their food options are up on a menu so it's easy to read and quick to decide. Prices are also clearly listed out so you're never surprised at what you end up paying for your bowl. They're also very fairly priced.  My mom comes in all the time now. I went with her today for the second time and was pleased that the staff recognized her, asked how she was, and thanked her for continuing to come in. You're really only as good as your staff, and man does this place hit it out of the park.  This is also the first poke shop that I've seen the option to get a bowl or a wrap, which is essentially a poke burrito. Tried the wrap for the first time today and it was fantastic! I'm never let down by the food here. Excellent quality, excellent taste.  I only hope that they expand their food options in the future. They have a great selection as is right now but it would be nice to see more options added as you continue to grow.  My new favorite poke place! Absolutely must try!",

There's something kind of icky about seeing all that raw fish just sitting in metal containers. I opted for \"The Cali Way\" because it seemed like the most familiar thing to me- a humongous California roll.   I gotta say, I was impressed. It was perfect amounts of soft & crunchy. It was very tasty and fresh.   I really wish this restaurant used less plastic. The bowls & cutlery are all plastic, as are the drink options. They have pre-made cups of iced teas sitting in an open fridge. Why not offer reusable bowls and cups for dine-in customers?",

Staff was very friendly and they took our orders fast. It's a great place to come in your are craving some sushi. Their fish taste of good quality and the rice and add one go perfectly. I personally ordered the seasons ahi tuna and salmon with half white and half brown rice and almost every add on there was.   Next time I think I can do without the crab add on as it over took the flavor of the fish and was a bit too heavy for my liking.",

This was one of the first places I had a poke burrito. Pretty cool idea as I like virtually anything in burrito form. That came out wrong. I like.....ehh nevermind. Anyways, on to the food.  I made a custom burrito with tuna, salmon, edamame, mango, and all of my other normal mix-ins. Maybe it was the mango, but it just tasted extremely bland. Fish didn't taste very fresh and the sauces were pretty uneventful. It has a really good rating on yelp, so maybe I should give it another chance. Currently, I prefer Poke Wave and Ahipoki to here.",

Service:  This location has the friendliest staff and they go out of their way to make extra conversation and just treat you like not only a customer, but a person.   Offers:  If you submit your phone number for rewards, you get $1 off your order the next time. I love adding avocado to my bowls, so on the next visit, I will always get essentially get the avocado topping for free.   Food:  Poki Bowls-My favorite is the 1/2 salad 1/2 rice bowls. I choose brown rice and for my meat, I like the ahi tuna and salmon. The other options include mango bits, which is a refreshing touch and adds that hint of tropical taste to the poki bowl. You can add avocado for $1 additional charge. For crunchies, I just like to add sesame seeds. You can add sauce to the whole bowl or just the meat. I like adding it to just the meat, because I feel like the crab and seaweed salad that I add to the bowl give it the right amount of moisture it needs.  Burritos- this basically all the fillings inside a seaweed wrap so it looks like a burrito. I have yet to try it, maybe on my next visit.   Portions:  Large! Generous portions here for a decent price. I have seen other poki places charge the same amount for not so much food.  I highly recommend Pokitrition! I love having a place I can go to for dinner, lunch, or even a post-workout meal because it's healthy, nutritious, has your good proteins as well as greens for a fueled diet.",

As we entered the place had few people, the food is raw, fresh and made in front of you. We were attended quickly. The menu is quite simple, its either a bowl or a burrito.  I chose burrito with shrimp and salmon, with rice, spicy cream sauce, peas, onions and crab with salad as a side. I liked how the burrito was wrapped in a sea weed and it was a whole giant sushi. I am a big fan of sushi and this looked pretty interesting.  When I took a bite off the burrito, it was delicious, I quickly finished the half and when I went onto the second one it was alright but towards the end there was so much rice, no sauce and there was no meat either. It was bland and there was too much rice. I was definitely full by the end of it but felt it was a little too greasy for a sushi.  Overall I liked the place and want to try the rice bowl but wish there was more seafood and less greasy. The price is decent and a good lunch spot. Looking to put this place on my rotation.",

Went to the counter and the food was EVERYWHERE.  Sushi salad was spilled on the handle of the scoop next to it, sides were mixed into other bins, and everything was uncovered even though no one was being served and the wait staff was in the back.  We had a chance to walk in, see the mess, discuss if we wanted to eat that, and walk out before any employee saw us, because they stayed in the back.  Ended up going to yogis grill anyway.  Our second choice, but much cleaner and the staff was actually visible.  Too bad, it would have been our first time going to this local place that we pass by often.  Guess we won't be a regular.",

Ingredients were fresh and the girl working made several good suggestions. I just thought it lacked some flavor, but maybe I needed some soy sauce on the side. The burrito concept also means the ingredients aren't evenly mixed throughout - at times I would get a big bite of cucumber alone or bites without sauce. The sushi burrito is very trendy and sure to get a lot of social media attention, but I would pass if you're just going for taste.",

When they had their grand opening, I fully intended to come out and support them however they posted a video of the lines and I was like oh no, I can't wait in a line that long, not even for BOGO and I'm glad I didn't. I thought Pokitrition would be like Jaburrito in Vegas and it almost was just without the flavor and the taste. It's set up like a Chipotle and I went for the poke wrap with white rice,  1/2 salmon and  1/2 spicy tuna. I wish I had just chosen salmon because the consistency of the spicy tuna threw me off and I'm not a sushi virgin or anything, something just tasted off to me. I chose the traditional sesame shoyu sauces with surimi crab as my side, topped with masago, watermelon radishes, and sesame seeds. I couldn't even taste the sauce at all; my wrap was just so dry and flavorless which was super disappointing because I had this place bookmarked from when they were still in their soft opening and was really excited to try it. Literally all I could taste was that not spicy tuna that was a little off and I even opened up my wrap at one point to scoop it out but after that it had no flavor, lol. The customer service was great and the inside is nice and clean and new but I just can't get passed the lack of flavor. Next time I want a poke wrap or a sushi burrito, I'm just gonna stick with Sushi Stop Udon & Grill on Dobson/Guadalupe because for a little bit more, you get a huge serving with a ton of flavor. Sorry Pokitrition. :-(",

Walked in and was greeted with a smile by lively employees. The process is similar to poke shops out in LA where you pick the base, fish, sauce and toppings.   They were telling me the tuna is from Hawaii and i could definitely taste the difference. It didn't taste like the fish from LA at all. We definitely need more places like this in LA!  The fish was just sooo fresh. It definitely tasted like fish you get from a plate of sashimi",

Now that there are more options, it is more of a fair comparison. The setup at Pokitron is more compact than some of its competitors, so it did take some explaining to get my sea legs. Despite my lengthy questioning the staff was very patient and explained all the options. I ended up with a half and half bowl, half salad half rice, with the traditional tuna. The add in choices here are better than other places I've been and the final creation was my favorite poke bowl to date. I will be back, like stalker status...this place is going to get sick of me real quick!",

Their sauces were delicious and the burrito stayed together super well, making it very easy to eat.  And the burritos were HUGE.  I ended up having to take a half home for later because it was so large.  We also got an order of miso soup and it was delicious as well.

My friend had her daughter with us and she needed to use the restroom, since no one was helping us she took her daughter to the restroom. The cashier had to come and help me after I was waiting for few minutes. When my friend came back with her daughter, she tried to order her food and the cashier told her that she would now need to wait at the end of the line that grew to five more people. I was taken aback by that seeing we were Both waiting for quite some time before being helped. The food was great, very fresh and great flavors. The tea was flat, could tell it was not fresh. The staff was very friendly but they need to figure out better system to manage people in store and the Togo orders.",

    "text": "I'm addicted to Poke! Pokitrition is close to work so it makes this location convenient. The fish is always fresh and the toppings are great. (The mango sounds weird but is fantastic!) I like their Ponzu & Aioli combined which makes for a great sauce.  I've only ever had the poke bowl, just because I want EVERY topping and think it would just be too much to roll in a burrito. Couple things I wish, is that they would maybe offer another fish option. (yellowtail, octopus, etc) and the wasabi. They are getting better with it, but it's a tiny little bit in a cup you have to request when paying. (super tiny... like silly tiny amount) I can't imagine wasabi is too expensive, put it in line with the toppings and let me get a good kick in my bowl too.  Overall it's a great place and worth a try.",

My sushi burrito, I think could have been better with expert advice. I suggest if the people could give ideas for better combinations to pick on a sushi burrito because I don't know what pairs nicely with what. My floppy version was alright but it wasn't great. So in a way I'm putting myself down not the restaurant. Just suggest better stuff with the burrito if you see a noob ordering.",

The protein selection was good and seemed fresh. The sauces were the right amount and the rest of the toppings made for a lot of choices.  I love that they give you two scoops of either crab or seaweed salad. It makes the cost of an 11$ bowl worth it.  Overall this place is noteworthy and we will return.  I would have given a 5 but being rushed through the line and the limited amount of drink selections made it a little less than perfect.",

Growing up in Hawaii, poke has always been prepared in a certain manner by a chef or a mom or uncle, where you are tasting what they think it's good. When you make it yourself, you control what you put in and deal with the consequences, as with all experimentations. This halfway in the middle approach in which this establishment tries to achieve, falls short. Pick your own sauce and combination works well for ice cream and maybe sandwiches, but not poke. Additionally, the bowls are small, and even smaller are the amount of fish you get.   Do yourselves a favor and head down the road to the other poke place. They do it better, a bit closer to Hawaii, at least",

Hits the spot every time. Ends up being a bit pricey at almost $12. Fills you up. But doesn't leave you feeling bad or stuffed / lethargic. I'd get the wrap which is like a giant sushi roll if they served it with brown rice (for health reasons). Try it out!",

    "text": "This is another chipotle style fast food place.  Only tried the wrap, but based on that I wouldn't go back.  They use too much sesame oil on the outside of the wrap which makes the wrap feel greasy. The seaweed used for the wrapper was also a little too salty.  They do not have fountain drinks which is strange for a fast food place.   I also didn't like how everything was room temperature. The water was room temp (not sure they ever added ice to the jug) and worse the raw fish was also room temp.  When I told them I'd like the krab mix, they said that two are included, so I got 2 scoops of krab. But when I asked for seaweed in the next step they told me it would be extra. Afterwards noticed that it did say 2 sides which is either krab and/or seaweed, but since they were in separate sections of the line it was very unintuitive when you are going down the line.  The only redeeming quality was that the service seemed friendly and the place was clean.  I feel that there is a lot of potential for a places like this, but with all the competition in the area for similar fast poke places, I can't recommend this one.",

Which means, on another trip to California.... BUT!!!   I was recommended by a friend to try Pokitrition. It's new so the place was very clean, style is modern, and very well lit. It was our first time, so the staff gave us a run down on how to order at their location. The toppings are not a huge selection, but they were fresh and their sauce options actually tasted amazing! Each cube I bit into were so flavorful and soft. AND GET THIS. The spicy tuna was actually SPICY and the flavors of my bowl blended so beautifully together that I could hear the song \"Ave Maria\" play in my head with each slow and savory bite.   They only had one size bowl, I think. As the price was $9.95 for 2 selections of fish. It would have been nice if there were a small, medium, and large option. However, the current size made my piggy self full after eating about 3/4 of it and my brother had to put his in the fridge for a short break.  Hallelujah! Finally....... I found a place to satisfy my poke bowl cravings. Btw, I heard from a little bird that their fish was so fresh, that it flies in from Hawaii daily. I will definitely be eating here, A LOT.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful when I asked for suggestions on their sauces. I also love the large variety in toppings! (*Mangos topped on poke is, without a doubt, a game changer*) They aren't cheap on portions, so you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth because you will. The cashier who is also the co-owner was super friendly and accommodating. She really took the time to talk to me and asked about my first-time experience. It's safe to say that they've won me over and I can't wait to come back!   Never paying for overpriced + mediocre poke bowls and bad service from Ahi Poke Bowl again!",

Our littles (who do actually eat this kind of food too) eat a side of rice and miso soup if they aren't feeling like a wrap or bowl.   The staff is super helpful and nice and the menu is simple and affordable. I think that is why they have completely nailed the taste. They focused on one thing and hit it out of the park.

I think I might be addicted to the wraps (a giant sushi roll basically). You can taste the quality of ingredients and the price point to quality is good. I hope their quality remains high because I feel this is really what separates them from their competition, also I don't know anywhere else that does the poki wraps.   In a one week time they have adjusted so much to work out their soft opening kinks. Sky is the limit with how they will progress, I am excited for more of their stuff to roll out. (They have miso soup here, if that's something you want. It kind of hides in the menu)",

So I tried again, the rice has improved sauces still not that great and for the amount you get it's overpriced. Maybe I will try again in the future, for now I'll stick with Ahi poke bowl",

Ahi Poke and Poke Eats are better than this place, and here is why: Bigger servings, better options, and better environment.  Poketrition gives you the smallest servings of all the new poke shops in town, the bowls are pretty petite. You can and will eat a lot more at poke eats or ahi poke. Poketrition is not by any means a comfortable sit-down place, 99% of the time you will take it to go because it's small and cramped. This is not a big deal, but having room to sit and breathe is nice, it never hurt anyone...once again this is not a problem at the others.  Last gripe is their water situation, they have a tiny un-chilled crock of nasty cucumber water in the back of the restaurant with tiny dixie cups, it's either that or buy a Dasani. Just let people have water from the machine like everyone else please.  Competition is good and healthy, the more poke shops the merrier, but I don't see the big deal about poketrition, it never wowed and never lingered, and the servings are little. Kudos and good luck to the owners though, nothing wrong with having several options for consumers.  But for real, say no to that gross cucumber water.",

Pokitrition has quality poke that doesn't compare to any where else and i know that there fish is fresh. Where as to other poke places I'm kind of skeptical going to. There bowls are also a decent size, compared to Ahipoke there bowls are super small and the same price! This is the best poke restaurant in AZ hands down.",

    "text": "The sushi burritos seem smaller than a few months ago or maybe they are just inconsistent with making the burritos. I got two burritos. One with cheetos and the other without. The girl making my burrito reversed the cheetos inside rather than outside. I don't know if it makes a difference.   I feel like the service was very unwelcoming compared to when I used to come regularly months ago. The girl making my burritos was rude. I told her I needed a moment to think about what I wanted. She kept giving me annoyed looks like she wanted me to hurry up. I didn't even take a minute. I ended up rushing my order because she kept hurrying me.  So I ended up making both burritos the same to make it easier for her. But she still seemed annoyed and rushed me a lot. My burritos ended up tasting disappointing and extremely salty. I clearly told her I wanted very light dressing. She gave me a look and drenched both fish with a lot of sauce. I also wanted to ask if there was an extra charge for cheetos since I never added it before, and I had some other questions. But she made me feel like I was a bother, so I couldn't bring myself to ask.   I figured out at the end that the cheetos are an extra 75 cents. The cashier kind of rushed me too, but he wasn't as bad. I didn't consider it that busy. I came pretty early around 11:40am ish. I want to give a 1 star for this experience. But I gave a 2 star because I used to like this place, and the old employees were friendly. I probably won't be back, unless I am in the area and desperately hungry.",

Customer Service: Picture this... a hipster sushi restaurant. That's the only way I can describe it. All of the employees were happy and smiling. It was my first time there so they explained how it worked and all the ingredients. The tuna is flown in fresh from Hawaii everyday. Just incredible. 2 thumbs up to the management and team.   Food: It's sushi so it's pricey. Having said that, the food was absolutely delicious and the sauces they mix in are so tasty. I didn't want to meal to end. You will not be upset, and do what I did and get a wrap not a bowl. You won't be disappointed. The sushi was fresh and you can taste it. In mine I had shrimp, tuna, salmon, Sriracha sauce, edamame, seaweed salad, mango, roe, green onion, roasted sesame seeds. Wow. Once again, 2 thumbs up.   Drinks: The drink I had was delicious. It was a mango tea locally brewed. It wasn't too sweet but just really fresh tasting. I really wish they had Simple Soda!  Restrooms: They maintained the wooden pallet theme in the bathroom too and it was very clean. Nice job. 5 stars all around!",

I work right by Chandler fashion square mall and this is a 5 minute drive from work ! Right off the 101 and Ray road. Needless to say, this will be my only go to spot for lunch now. Found it on yelp today and within 5 minutes , my co worker and I rushed over to get one.   Just like all the poke bowl places here but you have your choice of a bowl, wrap, or salad and great choices of mix ins.  We each got a wrap. I got mine with tuna and salmon and you get your choice of 2 additional add ins such as seaweed salad or crab salad or spicy crab salad. I got 2 scoops of crab salad to go with my tuna and salmom, and I got avocado, which is a dollar extra but they do not hold back on the amount they give you. Put a few finishing touches on it with masago and green onions and sesame seeds. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I was in heaven eating this the whole time and my co worker loved it and already told his friend about it.   Place is small but has adequate seating. Everyone who worked here was so nice and smiled!  Make sure you get one of their stamp cards if you plan on going back as much as I do.  Can't wait to come back and turn on more of my co workers to it !",

As I will be visiting Kauai soon, I wanted to get a full serving of this thing everyone goes crazy about. I was absolutely blown away with the quality and taste at this new business!  I ordered a poke bowl with marinated tuna, cabbage, seaweed salad, and sesame seeds drenched in sriracha aioli. In a word: heavenly! My wife ordered the same but with spicy tuna and I got to have a bite--equally as good as the marinated mix. For a beverage we bought a bottle of watermelon water, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds (water taken straight from ripe watermelons--none added!). My wife loved the experience so much that she bought an \"I (heart) poke\" tank from them for $10. Someone's a little excited for Hawaii next month hehe.  The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming during the duration of our wait and meal. It really put the cherry on top and made it a certainty that I'll be back for many more poke bowls (and wraps) to come!",

Select your base or in a burrito I wanted tuna but I looked at it and it reminded me of the canned kind I ate as a kid on white bread. Not firm like ahi tuna should be. They don't really have many fish choices so I decided to go with salmon. I chose the burrito option which was a huge mistake. I could barely eat it as it was so dry. The rice was crunchy and the proportion of rice to filling was way off. Other Yelp reviews said the service was so great but that was not my experience. Makes we wonder if they are mostly friends and family writing them. The workers seemed completely disinterested and untrained. How hard is it to put fish and toppings and roll them up? I could not get out of this place any faster. With all the competitors in town, not sure how this place will make it, bad location, bad food and poor customer service.",

That way I didn't have to worry about getting anything wrong for my husband as he got to pick all of his ingredients.  I had the spicy tuna and the marinated tuna, and although the spicy tuna was good, I liked the marinated tuna even better and think I will get a double serving next time.  I also would be interested in adding additional fish because the serving is not big.  I also thought they were very light on the cucumber and would have liked more. Next time I will ask for it and see what happens. They charge 9.95 for the make your own bowl and an additional 1.95 for extra fish.  The staff was super nice and the restaurant was clean.",

They only offer 4 fish options-salmon, tuna, spicy tuna and shrimp--limited. In LA, I usually get double salmon, octopus, tempera shrimp and scallops (and free avocado). Free Mango add in here is a nice touch. Still missing and prefer the miso dressing option. Great unusual drinks but pricey for tea. Friendly staff. I would probably give 3 stars but I want the poke shops to succeed in AZ.",

I had salmon, spicy tuna, red onions, cilantro, green onions, both spicy and regular crab salad, furikake and fried onions to finish. It tasted so fresh and the price to portion ratio was ideal!

    "text": "I will be back - let's get that out of the way.  I went in and kind of felt blind since there was no menu to grab, or anything to go off of when you walk in the door.  However, I soon realized it is set up like Chipotle; pick your mode, protein, and toppings down the line and voila!  I was originally going to get a bowl, but when I saw how the rice was steamy and then they put the raw fish on top with the other cold toppings, I felt like this pairing was sacrilege - and would not pass the freshness test on my trek back to work.  So I went with the Poke Roll (a sushiritto!).  Got double salmon; they sort of make you choose a crab mix and a seaweed salad.  I was not really a fan of either, to be honest.  The seaweed salad is stringy and gets stuck in your teeth, and really didn't lend much as far as flavor goes.  I'll opt out of both the next time.  What I really didn't appreciate was the oil on my seaweed wrap.  I understand the importance of a non-stick situation when you're banging out rolls, but at the expense of an oily sushi roll?  Hard Pass.  All in, the salmon was a good consistency, but could have been colder - this can be solved by popping it into the freezer for a few minutes before digging in.  The rice was perfect, the available toppings were colorful and fresh - the taste was great, but I will try it in a bowl next time - and ask for cold rice!  They get extra points for the little to-go containers of ginger and wasabi ;)",

He was rude ringing us up because it was 15 mins before closing. We weren't the last customers so he shouldn't have been annoyed at us and second we asked them if we could still get something when we went in and all the workers said yes. I would have given this 5 stars, but that cashier's rudeness and unprofessionalism was why I wanted to give this place 0 stars. We even asked him since there were 4 of us if we can gets stamps for all the bowls on one stamp card and he said if we are paying with two different cards then no. Honestly if that's your policy then that doesn't make sense and isn't a good business practice. Then when my friend got rang up buy the other cashier (smaller Asian male worker) he was nicer, polite, and more professional. We liked him better and he is what real customer service is about and why I added 2 stars.",
