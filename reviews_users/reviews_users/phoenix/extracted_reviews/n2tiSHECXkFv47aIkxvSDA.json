George, the owner, always is quick witted and makes your dining experience unforgettable! Tonight I had the special, snapper with clam sauce, my wife had the mix trio, and George made my daughter a pita with chicken and cheese.  Before our meal we chose to start out with dolmathes, spanakopita, and saganaki....all were incredible and NOTHING was left to waste!  We were eating as if it were our last meal and that's just a testament to the incredible experience your mouth will delight in during your time spent here. We were excited to try their version of baklava, George describes it as baklava on crack, and it is!  It was delicious! We took a couple of sample bites and had to take it home for later and as we went to take our leave we said our goodbyes to George and his son Dimitri as though we were saying farewell to family.  Thanks for everything it was another unforgettable dining experience!",

The soup we had was lentil. Frankly, it was just OK. It had rice instead of potatoes, which was a huge disappointment. But that was the last disappointment I had. Even though we came for lunch, I ordered off the dinner menu. This was my birthday lunch, and I wanted lamb. I got the lamp chops. I was somewhat disappointed that there were only four lamb chops. By the time I finished, I was really disappointed that there were only four. Those were some of the best lamb chops I had ever had in my life. Maybe it was a good thing that there were only four, Had there been more, I probably would've eaten them. That would've been a disaster. As it was, I had a room for dessert. George talked us into the cheesecake with baklava on top of it. Oh my. That was so wonderfully delicious. Basically, I have my new go to place for special events. The lamb was not cheap, But for a super treat, this is certainly the place to go.  By the way, my spouse had the gyro salad and was well pleased.",

It's a family restaurant that's been handed down, and I have never been in there and not seen the owner. He cares about his customers and his food, and he's fun to chat with. They have a great selection of wines and beers, and there are always lots of specials. This is a great place to take a date (or the wife for date night). The atmosphere inside is intimate and welcoming. If you ask the waiter or owner what's good tonight, you get an honest answer, and I like that. I often go with their recommendations. Now, this may not sound good at first... but they have a desert called a Baklava Cheesecake. It's cheesecake with baklava on top. You'd think that would be too sweet, but it's not and it's great, one of my favorite deserts anywhere. If you're looking for upscale Mediterranean dining in a friendly and intimate atmosphere, you can't go wrong with this place.",

On the way back home from Scottsdale, my wife & I decided to check out Greektown and I'm so glad we did. The food was fantastic!  We started with the saganaki flambe, a family fave, and at George's (the owner) suggestion, ordered the calamari as well. Both had outstanding flavor and were a perfect start to dinner.  The avgolemeno soup came hot and full of flavor, including a hint of cinnamon which really did enhance the dish. Then the entrees arrived. My wife had the pastichio, which she said was very tasty. I had the Capama (lamb in tomato broth); the meat was very tender and the sauce was the perfect blend of spices and tomato and wine.  We were too full to order desert, but I'm sure we'll be back the next time we're in the area. Definitely a must-try!",

I liked him, but I can see that some people wouldn't. Anyway, the only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because when we first walked in we just stood there. No one greeted us, a waitress walked by, made eye contact with me and didn't say anything. She could've at least acknowledged that I was standing there and said someone would be right with us. Anyway, we finally got seated and ordered. We had the calamari appetizer. I hate seafood, but this was really good. It was fresh calamari sauteed in garlic, lemon, and olive oil. Very fresh tasting and didn't taste fishy at all. It came with a side of homemade marinara sauce. The sauce was AMAZING. I will be going back to try the pasta since the sauce was THAT great. We then ordered two classic gyros (only $7 each). I've never had one before, so this was interesting. It was huge, lots of lamb meat, perfectly cooked. It wasn't greasy or anything like others have said gyros can be. It came with a big side of greek salad. Didn't care for the sauce that came with the gyro, so I asked for more of the delicious marinara and dipped my gyro in that. Overall nice dining experience. Place was very clean and decorated with greek things and played greek music. I will definitely be going back.",

We had tried other Greek restaurants years ago, but quickly settled on Greektown for its consistently superb food and entertaining and gracious atmosphere.  Going there is always a fun experience.  George, the owner, makes sure you feel welcome as you come through the door.  But that's just the beginning.  While you're eating, you hear the laughter and sense the enjoyment that all the other diners are experiencing and that makes for a very cordial, comfortable and happy atmosphere.  Then there's the food.  The lemony soup is delicate, the salads are fresh and enticing, the vegetables are seasoned wonderfully, and the meats never disappoint -- they're top-notch quality and full of wonderful flavors.  The portions are generous and the specials are always creative.  In these days of economic woes, when other restaurant owners have downgraded their quality of food just to keep afloat, Greektown is diligent about keeping its level of food quality and service at its highest.  We don't just go to Greektown for the food -- we go there to enjoy dining at its fullest.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in after visiting my daughter at the hospital nearby. It was late (after 8:00 pm) and they were busy, so we waited for 15 minutes for our table. The food coming out looked delicious.  We got into our booth and the service was very good.   My husband and I both had the saganaki (Oopa!) flaming cheese, which George (owner) made sure it melted nicely before letting the flame go out. It was delicious. We also both had the gyros platter. They were very good, tasty, plenty of food. The yummy egg-lemon soup and Greek salad made the dinner complete.   My only real criticism: for a place with so many authentic Greek dishes, PLEASE make gyros the traditional way-on the vertical barbecue and cut the meat to order. These were pre cut, formed slices of gyros- about as far from authentic as you can get; their only saving grace was their good flavor.  But I missed the char, spices and chew of authentic Greek gyros.  This is the only reason I'm giving then 4 stars instead of 5.    My 4 year old granddaughter had the Greek spaghetti, which had a good hit of cinnamon flavor; a nice departure from our Italian family's flavors.   The owner -George - is a character, and the place looks and feels like the type of friendly neighborhood place you want to be in again and again.  Regulars were hugging George and their waitstaff on the way out. A great experience and one we will return to soon.   4/23/2016 Returned here while daughter was waiting for a procedure. Had their trio sampler, with moussaka, pastitsio, and cheese puffs. Excellent!  Also found out that the gyros I thought were not authentic were actually made by the owner. He roasts the gyro loaf to rare, cuts it to order, then finishes it up on the grill. Still doesn't taste the same as the more traditional version, but explains the great flavor he achieved.   George is great, service awesome. Go!  OOPA!",

Saganaki Flambeau Kefalograviera (sheep's milk cheese) baked with olive oil, brought to the table in a flaming dish, drizzled with fresh squeezed lemon juice. Laid atop their thick sliced garlic bread, this is outstanding!  Spanakopites Flaky phyllo dough baked with spinach and feta cheese inside This classic Greek treat is a must have, and theirs was great!  Main courses: Pasteetso Lasagna, Greek style; Pastisio noodles with beef, tomatoes, and onions, and a cream sauce with cinnamon The potato topping was beautifully creamy!  Mousaka (a personal favorite dish) Similar to Pasteetso, but with eggplant instead of noodles Same amazing topping!  Capama Lamb stew served over rice Not my dish, but the bite I tasted was delightful  Baklava Cheesecake Oh. My. God. One of the most delicious slices of cheesecake I've ever enjoyed, served with a piece of Baklava on top, and garnished with ridiculously good hand made whipped cream, sprinkled with cinnamon The Baklava, also hand made, was also just incredible  As great as the food is, the atmosphere created by the restaurateur makes the experience so much better  Definitely must return!",

The calamari was fresh, cooked perfectly and then coated in an amazeballs lemon garlic sauce. The bread basket was awesome, fresh garlic bread and pita. Then the salad came out... With a fantastic and light dressing that didn't overpower the veggies. The pastitsio was as good as my yiayia makes it, and the patates and veggies that came with were seasoned perfectly and absolutely delicious. The baklava cheesecake, OMG. So freaking fantastic!!   The owner is a character and hilarious, plus friendly and so welcoming. This is a definite must go if you love Greek food, are Greek and picky, or just a regular joe that has never had Greek food and want to try it! Go go go!!",

We made reservations, and upon arrival, the owner's son said there were people without a reservation that got there before us, and they had to be seated first.  50 minutes later, we were seated, hoping for good Greek comfort food. Unfortunately, the spanakopita was bland, essentially free of feta, and under-filled. The tiropites were similarly bland and sparse of filling.   The salad was heavily dressed with a generic Italian bottled-style dressing and the avgolemono soup had hardly any rice or chicken (tiny bits of chicken that were overcooked and chewy).   The pastitso was rich and soothing, while the dolmades were wonderfully flavorful, albeit small of portion. The entrees were accompanied by apparently boiled vegetables.  We had hoped for much more...",

We had a very large party, and George gave us a quote in advance.  The bill far exceeded the quote, even though we were served what we were quoted, and nothing more.    The dips were the best part of the meal, but far too little pita to enjoy - and we felt like we were being a bother by asking for more.  George and his staff appeared annoyed even though we were very respectful and simply didn't want the delicious dips to be wasted!  It's not like we were trying to fill up on bread, we had already paid for the entire meal.  We also opted for a baklava dessert @ $3 per person.  It was maybe a 1/4 piece of baklava each... sincerely disappointing.  As a big, fat Greek group, we were expecting the food to taste authentic.  It didn't.  Some of the worst pastitsio I've ever had - and cold, too.  If he did use lamb, I feel awful that the lamb died to end up in that dish.  In summary, even though Greektown is close to home, it's not worth the drive.  Maybe he does a better job with single tables, but I won't take that chance.",

He invited us to the bar, poured us some wine and had a nice booth ready for us in two minutes. We shared some tzatziki with fresh warm bread. I pointed to the menu and asked George which of two shrimp entrees he would recommend. He said, \"I'll give you some of each; you tell me which one is better!\" O.K....both were great. My kids had salad with chicken, pasta with meat sauce and my husband had a delicious chicken dish. We were \"forced\" to get George's dessert: baklava cheesecake. Yeah, don't miss it. And then he poured us some complimentary Ouzo. His wife was working in the kitchen. His son was helping to wait tables. All and all it was a wonderful family dining experience. And there were at least a dozen plates broken. OPA!",

This is a family restaurant and they are all very friendly- as if to welcome us in their home and share their culture with us. Price and portion of food are reasonable. The kids loved it. We tried the Saganaki Flambeau, which is a great way to start off. They have you say \"opa\" before you can eat it & the while restaurant will say it with you. One kiddo had the Tortillini with meat sauce & the other a Charbroiled Chicken Ceasar's Salad. My husband had a cheese lasagna and I had the chicken gyro. All of it very delicious. They only have 3 desserts but I love baclava so the desert menu hit high marks. They only have Lager beer, which I'm more of the Ale or mild beers but boy was their beer refresh in and smooth - I forgot the name of it (it starts with an \"A\"). They also have a house wine for $4 a glass. George made the kids a blue sprite drink he calls, Windex. This was my first time eating here but definitely not the last. We found this place when watching \"Check Please\" which is great to watch - it gives you ideas of yummy places to eat, all over Arizona. It's also a great way to support the local, small, family owned businesses. We watch it religiously & visit the places they air on their show. Whoever picked this restaurant did a great job.",

George served us, and was perfection - everything he recommended was exceptional - we weren't going to get an app, but he sold us on the calamari and it did not disappoint!  The (little) remaining sauce was scooped up with bread, it was so delicious! Entrees come with soup (today, a chicken broth with lemon/garlic/onion that was well-balanced and delicous) and a salad, full of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta, peppers, kalamata olives - way too much food!  My husband had the special and I had Shrimp Grigori - devine sauce, tender shrimp, good ratios of crab.   $4 Pinot Grigio was a bargain, although round 2, George suggested a Greek white from Crete that was even better!

But, he was the only server tonight and was totally distracted, all business, not his old friendly, chatty self that always added to the charm of this gem.  We tried to engage him in conversation but he wanted no part of it.  He wasn't busy.  There was only one other table occupied in the whole place.  But maybe that was the problem.  We don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time.  You couldn't ask for more authentic, delectable food and great prices.  Maybe it's the location, maybe it's his attitude.

This was literally the best meal I have had in several years. The owner is an absolute character who makes you feel like one of the family. He also had no problem telling you what dishes he prefers and his selections always live up to your expectations. We ended up staying a few hours exchanging stories and having a few good laughs. This restaurant is a True gem in the valley and I look forward to my future visits. - the dental guy",

    "text": "First off, long wait for a table even though there were many empty. They said they had reservations for them but they were never filled the whole time we were there. Atmosphere what fun though, and George had a great personality. They get the whole restaurant(not a huge dining room, very intimate) involved when yelling opa or singing happy birthday. The food is, well some was good, some was bad. The dolmas were amazing, and spanakopita was baked nicely and tasty. The gyro meat was quite flavorful but the onions they put on it was chopped horrible and fell right out. The mousaka and pasteesto were very overcooked and just mush, no texture at all. The vegetables were unseasoned and overcooked as well. Received the snapper in clam sauce and although the flavor was spot on, my dish was microwaved, or as it seemed. The fish had great flavor but again was mush, and came out so hot that you know it didn't come out of a Saute pan. Our tab was eighty dollars without any alcohol and the dishes were subpar. For that price I expected properly cooked food, on clean plates. Not microwaved fish and dirty rims. I would like to say I would come back and give another try, but we drove out to this side of town just to try it and can't envision myself doing that again. Maybe if I'm in the area. Great service, cute restaurant, disappointing entrees with a hefty price tag.",

We also had the baklava for dessert, which was amazing. I asked for the owners recommendation for one of the flavored ouzo after dinner drinks and tried \"the windex\". Everything was so yummy and we had a fun experience. Our 9 month old was being a bit fussy so the owner walked him around the restaurant a bit to entertain him which was so cute. Would definitely come back here often, the atmosphere is also great for a date night",

    "text": "A few friends are regulars here and can't stop talking about this place so my wife and I joined them last Saturday night at about 7pm.  It was pretty dead and we had our choice of table.  The decor is pretty interesting but is pretty typical of a Greek place.  *Pitas = Wow.  Excellent.  No idea if they are homemade though but they come fresh and warm.  They will also give you as much as you want on the house. *Saganaki Flambeau = Flaming Cheese = I love food/drinks that are on fire.  This dish was pretty good and just like at other Greek places. *Fried Calamari = Pretty good.  There was some kind of sauce (butter and lemon?) on it that I'm not so sure about but it was pretty good. *Soup = All meals come with this.  It is pretty good.  It is some type of lemon chicken soup. *Salad = All meals also come with this.  It is a small and standard Greek salad.  It was ok. *Dimitri's Leg = tender and tasty.  Didn't really taste like lamb though.  I could have sworn it was brisket.  Comes with a little bit of veggies and potatoes.   Overall I thought the food was just good.  Most of the dinner menu looks to be higher end Greek fare (I think) with the owner's special twist, so next time I think I'm going to go with some Greek classics such as a gyro, mousaka, etc. so I can get a True feel of this place.  The real star of this place is the owner/waiter/server, George.  This guy is a real character and I think is on crack.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see him.  Anyway, he is a real nice guy, is very talkative, has some pretty good stories and you can tell he really loves his restaurant.  He even gave us a drink on the house at the end of our meal.",

It was funny because the first time i went with a guy & he paid for everything so i didn't really have to worry about what i got, but the 2nd time i came in was with one of my girl friends & we both were planning to pay seperate & then did i realize the prices...  I wouldn't say its overly expensive because what you get is what you pay for & everything is phenomial, however, being a young college student, i didnt want to lay down 15/20 bucks for dinner, so we decided to leave & George literally came running out after us & wanted to figure out what was wrong. Once he heard about why we were leaving immediately hooked us up with a deal & pretty much charged half price on everything with free desert. It was amazing.  George is awesome. All the employees are really inviting & nice as well. Come here & enjoy the authentic, raw culture of Get em to the Greek! :]",

    "text": "I almost never right reviews, but this place was that good!  My fiance and I had lunch at Greektown yesterday after doing a quick Google search for places in our area. Their website had a coupon for 20% off, so we were sold. We had a late lunch around 2. We got there as another group was leaving, and we were the only couple in the restaurant for a while, which wasn't a bad thing. The decor inside was cute, and I didn't think it was overboard cheesy. Everything was blue and white, and they had murals of Greece's beaches on the walls.  George the owner was our host, server and chef. I don't know what other Yelpers were complaining about. I thought he was very genuine and friendly. He welcomed us like we were in his home from the second we got there. Literally he said, \"You guys make yourself comfortable wherever you want.\" He chatted with my fiance some about traveling to Europe, because although he had never visited Greece, my fiance did live in Germany for a couple years and for some reason there was a lot of Greek food there.   We ordered the calamari to share for an appetizer. Wow. Okay, it was AMAZING. I had only ever had calamari at chain Italian places before, and this was a huge step up. Since he made it for us, he told us that he breads it and pan sauteed it rather than deep frying it. It was delicious. It came with a basket of pita, which was also delicious. I ordered the George's chicken and my fiance got a Greek salad with shrimp. My fiance said his salad was very good, but I was pretty surprised that on a $11 salad he got two shrimp. Yeah, they were jumbo shrimp, but I still thought it was weird. My fiance thought it was normal, so I don't know. He did say the salad was delicious. He didn't go hungry anyway because he shared my lunch plate too. The salad came with a Tzatziki sauce that knocked our socks off. We tried dipping just about a little of everything in it, It was VERY good.  The George's chicken was possibly, no joke, the most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my life. It had a side of some kind of pan fried potatoes, and was two grilled chicken breasts topped with mushrooms, artichoke hearts and some kind of sauce which my fiance and I called \"awesome sauce.\" It was some kind of garlicky, lemony, buttery sauce. We ate the whole plate of food and dipped our pita in the rest of the sauce. It was amazing. Now obviously we were stuffed at this point but George offered us dessert. Normally we would have turned it down, but he said he had make some kind of cheesecake with baklava on top. Whhhaaat? We just had to try it, so we shared a piece.   First, let me say, I am a Jewish girl from the Northeast. I LOVE a good cheesecake, and I also know you can put almost anything on a cheesecake and it will be delicious. This was no exception. The cheesecake itself was not a dense baked New York style cheesecake that I usually love, it seemed more like a Jell-o no bake cheesecake, but it did taste like it was made from scratch and it was DELICIOUS. I just also know I am somewhat of a cheesecake-a-holic, and this by no technical standards was the greatest cheesecake I've ever had. The baklava on top more than made up for it though. If George invented the baklava cheesecake this man is a genius and he restaurant is worth visiting for that fact alone. The whole thing was the cherry on a FANTASTIC meal.   The food was five stars, and the service was five stars, which is really rare these days. Totally worth checking this place out! I know we will be back!",

    "text": "I read that the Best Greek Restaurant of Phoenix 2012 was Greektown, and immediately saw that it was very close to my house. So, my friend (part Greek) and I decided to go check it out.  It was a good decision. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. It was the best I'd ever had though a couple were slightly overdone (for squids). I liked the fact that it wasn't heavily breadcrumbed like you normally find, and it was served in an olive oil, lemon, garlicky sauce. There was a tomato sauce in a ramekin that I just left off with for the most part (it wasn't anything special).  I ordered the special, Mix Trio--moussaka, spicy chicken, and pisc.... I don't know what it was but it was similar to moussaka only with potato and no noodles. She thought the moussaka was incredible. I thought it was good but I liked the pisc-whatever was better, lamb flavored with cinnamon, in a weirdly good combination. The chicken was good, clearly flame-seared and cooked right, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or interesting.  She ordered dolmades, and they were clearly not from a can like most places. Dill and mint flavored them, (the dill was a little surprising to me) and they were not sour or slimy.  Their salad dressing was subtle and we ate it after our meal to pack everything else in.  We also got dessert, the baklava cheesecake. It was a slice of baklava on a slice of cheesecake (garnished and dressed with honey and cinnamon). We couldn't eat it like that, the pressure to cut baklava would smash the cheesecake. We pushed it off and ate them separately. The baklava was good, but she's made better. The cheesecake was really good though, and maybe I'd suggest trying to figure out a way to make a baklava crust for it instead of the other way around?  So, I'd totally suggest it if you're anywhere near Sunnyslope and want some Greek food that's got some interesting herb/spice things going on. There were things we wanted to try that we didn't get but we probably will later.",

The one was always complaining to the other about the wait. Well, if you want something fast and quick, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO! This is a place to ENJOY AND RELAX! Well, amazing a BUG came to the lady that was BITCHING! I would east off the floor at Greektown! Being a General Manager in food for over 30 plus years, I KNOW THE TRICKS PEOPLE USE TO GET SOMETHING \"ON THE HOUSE\". This happened and I watched it! Well, George as always went OVERBOARD on stating was sorry and upset he was! This man, not once, not twice, but even went outside to their car to state how sorry he was! DO YOU SEE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE??? George, you were awesome, and went beyond what you needed to do! My wife has Breast Cancer. George put a smile on her face, and MADE HER DAY! We all had Pita's which were cooked with love, and the desert which is pictured IS TO DIE FOR!!! The cheesecake is out of this world! I live a total of  30 miles away, and if gas was over $4.00 again, I WOULD STILL GO HERE!!!! Thank you George, your wife, and your staff for caring! Godspeed my friend and keep up everything you do!!!",

    "text": "Greektown is not too far from my house & we'd been meaning to head over.  So, when my BF and I were wanting something 'different' than our norm, he suggested Greektown and off we went.  We pulled into a pretty deserted parking lot at 5:30 on a Tuesday and I was a little nervous.  Past Yelpers had given 4 stars, so in we went.  We were greeted by a man sitting at the bar - I am assuming the owner.  There was only 1 other occupied booth and he offered us our choice of where to sit.  We opted for a table and he handed us menus and said he'd be right back.  Looks to me like he does a lot of the work himself & you can tell he's proud of his food.  Just ask, he'll tell you, LOL... \"go figure\". (stop in and you'll laugh at my 'go figure' reference).  I'd decided on an appetizer of taramosalata.  He said, \"No\".  I said, please, and he again denied me.  He detailed how he couldn't get the fresh fish eggs that he normally used, and the other available options weren't up to his standards, so he wouldn't be serving that this week.  He went on to suggest the calamari and boasted it was the best in town.  It did NOT disappoint.  He said it wasn't fried, but it was crispy.  It was tender and flavorful.  Will order this again for sure.  On to dinner.  I couldn't decide between 2 shrimp dishes, so he offered to give me 1/2 and 1/2 so that I could try them both.  I wound up with Shrimp Grigori and Shrimp Trukolimano - both were fantastic.  BF ordered Angus the Greek (mmmm steak).   We had a cup of creamy, but light chicken soup with rice and lemon.  It had a little kick of spice and I promptly declared that to be the soup I want next time I am sick.  My shrimp was perfectly cooked and BF's steak was also cooked as ordered, bloody as hell.  DELICIOUS.    Along the way, our host suggested beers by asking if we like light or dark or somewhere in between. He was attentive, but not annoying, and FUNNY.  He's loud and jokes and makes you feel like you've been his customer for years.  As we were leaving, he thanked us for coming and told us our orders were fun.  Oh, I'll also say that the price seemed great.  We each had 2 beers, we split the calamari and we got soup & salad included in the meals - steak and shrimp - all for $65!    My only regret is not ordering the baklava cheesecake.  Next time I'll save room.",

    "text": "I've been to greek places all up and down the west coast, and this is my favourite for Arizona!  We started with the Saganaki Flambeau, brought to our table by George (the owner, lol). So yummy, spicier than I am used to, but irresistible! The basket of pita and seasoned bread was great. The pita was still warm and fluffy. Its not Stefano's (greek place in Vancouver, BC) fluffy pita bread, but still great.   We both had the chicken souvlaki. One thing I appreciated was that they take the chicken off the kabob before bringing it to you. Its a nice touch that makes dinner easier and less messy. Perfect seasoning, juicy, I literally said, \"Omg I want to have sex with this food\".   I could eat that tsatziki all by itself. It was flat out amazing, the best I have ever had, anywhere, ever. Omg, just thinking about it is making me crave it.   The veggies on the side were not the usual lemon flavoured ones, but these had been cooked in what seemed like cinnamon and nutmeg. It was unexpected and tasty.   We were there pretty late, and the last table there. They changed the music from the greek music to classic rock, we had a great time jamming out at our table as we ate.   Lastly, we talked to George a few minutes, and on our way out he offered me a free shot of Ouzo. We didn't get to have their baklava (which I heard was awesome) because my girlfriend is allergic to walnuts. The ouzo was a perfect finish to the meal, and George is hilarious.   Love this place!!!",

The food was average.  For Greek food, we usually go to Crazy Jim's on 15th Ave and Indian School, which is awesome, but doesn't have much room for large parties.  The owner (I think) was very friendly and worked very hard, but we could not get over the mediocrity of the food.  The two stars that I'm giving it are for the following; 1) cheesecake baklava (OUTSTANDING!!!) and 2) the friendly man who served us.  Other than that, we won't be returning.",

Relax, have a drink and some fun with him.  The food is so good that we over ordered and could have easily made a meal out of the the appetizers. The hot garlic toast AND hot pita bread are the best ever! I kidded George about his chewy pancakes (the pita) and he was delighted. Tried a Greek beer and it was to hoppy for my taste, guess I am just an American beer kind of guy. The food id good enough to bring you back and George is personal enough to keep you coming back.",

Loud & over-attentive, or at least not attentive in the helpful way we would've liked (e.g. bringing oil for the bread). I thought the food was mediocre and a bit over-priced. The server was convincing, so we went for the \"baklava cheesecake.\" I make baklava myself at home, & this had clearly been sitting out for too long, yet was somehow still dry (typically will soak up the syrup & get moister). He also killed it by drizzling what tasted like Nesquick choco syrup over it. NY-style cheesecake itself was good, although that's not what you look for in a Greek restaurant. Unfortunately it's the type of place where they charge you extra for every little thing; case in point, we told him we were pescatarians, yet he brought us a soup w/ chicken broth, then didn't offer to replace it w/ anything. My boyfriend's shrimp dish was over-salted. Finally, the restaurant's in a rough neighborhood. Tourists & those who've never tasted real Greek food may be fooled, but not those who've had Yia-yia's!",

This family owned and operated business is warm and welcoming. There is a small bar area for before dinner drinks and lots of regular seating. We ordered a bottle of rose that was okay, not great. However, that ends my complaints. The lentil soup before dinner was extremely flavorful as was flaming saganaki.  I ordered the lamp chops with rice and it was extremely delicious. My husband went for the moussaka and it's flavorful custard didn't disappoint us (yes, I got a few bites). The before dinner salad that came with my lamb chops was also crisp and the house dressing very good. Overall, get ready to shout out \"OOPAH\" a lot, smile, and enjoy the warm family service. Two thumbs up; way up!",

He was kind enough to offer some special Greek wine that wasn't on the menu. Delicious. We went from one course to another trying many delicious choices. Fried calamari was my friends favorite. The eggplant dip was very sweet and different flavor. Since I could not choose between two entrees, the owner was kind enough to split two entrees so I could try both. The grape leaves were very good, no hold up on oils and butter and calories but well worth the splurge including the dessert. Wow, we really ate a lot!  I will undoubtedly return. The music was local talent and as good as the food. The whole experience was unrushed and perfect. Till next time!",

This fast paced man greeted us and said it'll be a few minutes but \"park it \" at the bar and I'll get you a drink. He says you ever have \"Greek\" beer? And hands me an ice cold green bottle and pops the top. He poured the wife a nice red wine and said hey you can eat at the bar if you'd like, so we did. We started out with the mushrooms, cooked to perfection the warm pita and slightly chard bread was perfect for sopping up the sauce the mushrooms were cooked in. We both got something we were all to familiar with gyro sandwich and a gyro plate, the owner at you have it \"my\" way and add  he pork so we both say sure. Never had pork on my gyro but I'm up for new things. It was amazing and worth the $2.00 up charge. The soup was just perfect, the veggies cold and crisp. The cheesecake topped with baklava was nice little treat also. This place was fun people yelling OPA the occasional plate be smashed on the ground in celebration of a out of town guest. He even gave us a couple of shot of ouzo on him. The staff was friendly never ran out of water what a amazing place. Thanks for the awesome time... OPA",

He was super aggressive about upselling from the start. He also has a very abrasive personality. When Ild decline his pushes he would get angry, raise his voice and argue without listening to our response. Then held walked off in a huff... repeatedly.   I was with guests and did not want to make a scene so I just ignored his rudeness. But I can tell you, there's something wrong wth this man... he needs to stay away from customers.

George, the owner and waiter, is very gregarious and friendly and I asked him if they made kabobs there and he said sometimes they have beef or lamb (which I don't like anyway) but they could only make chicken kabobs so my date and I both decided to order the salmon special of the day.  I also took his advice and ordered a bottle of Amethystos, a white wine from the city of Drama in northeastern Greece.  He brought us the main course in a timely manner and it was topped with a lemon sauce and herbs, potatoes and carrots and the salmon was delicious!  Not really traditional Greek food but tasty nonetheless.  He also brought us a typical Greek salad which we shared.  George recommended a cheesecake dessert with falafel, topped with caramel and walnuts and served with cream and it was scrumptious and we demolished it eagerly!  An overall satisfying meal and atmosphere, although the party next to us was a little noisy and my only complaint is that I feel I was overcharged for the bottle of wine at $41 but my date and I both enjoyed it and you have to splurge sometimes to make a good first impression and I think I accomplished that!  I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back again!",

    "text": "First off, I have to say that the food was pretty good, and if I judged solely on that, Greektown would likely get four stars from me.  Unfortunately, the service (lack thereof?) was not so good.  I rank this place 2.5 stars, but since 3-4 days later we are still talking about the poor service, I rounded down to two instead of up.  We were for a birthday dinner this past weekend, a total of five adults and one infant .  We arrived around 5:30 or so, thinking this would be plenty of time to have the meal, and leave in plenty of time for the child to be home before 'cranky time'.  The first problem was when we had to wait for 5-10 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was half full.  If a second person hadn't come up to us, I'm not sure how long it would have taken.  The second problem was that the service was just slow.  Maybe this is normal here, but I've been to other Greek restaurants and the meal has never been this slowly paced.  Another person in our party thought they were understaffed, but I didn't get that impression.  Anyways, after an hour and fifteen minutes, we had only received the apps and just gotten our soups (note:  The hot/fresh pita bread was fantastic!)though one person did not receive a bowl for some reason.  At this point, our youngest dining companion let it be known that it was time to go.  I drew the short straw and headed home.  I was later informed that the service continued to be slow the rest of the time and the meal was not finished for another 45-60 minutes after I left.  I also heard that it took around 10 minutes for the check to be brought out after being requested.  When my meal arrived home, it tasted very good, even though I had to heat it up in the microwave.  Bottom line, I would give Greektown another chance based on the food alone.  However, if you have some time constraint or are with an infant (it was pretty loud in there), you might want to go someplace else.  2.5 stars, rounded down.",

There was  also a cheese dish that was good...it went well with the fresh pita and bread brought to the table.  We tried many items based on recommendations of the owner/server.  He was very attentive and chatty.  My main course was a grilled chicken gyro, although it was very good the veal that my gf got was excellent.  Everybody at our table loved their food.  The owner even brought us all shots of ouzo before we left...excellent with the rice pudding.  I'll be back here for sure.",

If you feel like comfort food, order the pastitsio, a Greek noodle casserole which probably carries enough calories to power a small city. If you're in for some lighter fare, try the fisherman's salad. Shrimp, squid and scallops punctuate this dinner-sized salad. Along with a bowl of George's sublime avgolemono soup, this is a hearty meal.  If you go, bring your sense of humor and tolerance for a little noise. Greektown is raucous fun in the best traditions of the Mediterranean disposition. Expect off-color jokes from the staff. Loosen up with a snifter of seven-star metaxa or a \"windex\", George's creation combining ouzo and other liquors.   The desserts are outstanding, from the chocolate mousse to the creamy rice pudding, and you'd have to be crazy not to try the baklava.  I've never had a bad meal at Greektown, and I've eaten there quite a bit. Drop in on George sometime. He'll treat you like family.",

A great light lager. There was so much on the menu that sounded delicious. He allowed me to split my appetizer and main entree. I had feta cheese and olives with a delicious hot pita bread and Tiropites which are a cheese puff pastry with feta and a side of their homemade Taziki sauce. I am not usually a Taziki fan but this was unbelieveable.  Before I knew it a salad (which I took to go with some baklava and eggplant go go) Baklava - hmm breakfast of champions?? Also a lemon, egg soup. Similar base as the lemon sauce they put on the domades. Yummy! My main entree consisted of a lamb skewer and Mousaka which is slices of eggplant sauteed in butter, layered with a spiced meat sauce topped with a becemel creme and a parmesan cheese. You could taste a faint hint of cinnamon in there too. Needless to say all that food, and 3 beers later I am in a serious food coma. I would definitely recommend this place. There are not too many mom and pop greek places in Phoenix. This place is great!! Family owned for many years. I met regulars who used to frequent the old location with George's father. His father also owned a greek place in Hollywood from 68-98...So if anyone knows greek food its George... Love this place!! Support local Phoenix businesses!!",

The \"plato fantasia,\" or something like that (meant for two, enough for 3) was totally delish, with salmon, lamb, dolmades, some macaroni casserole-ish thing, fresh veggies and rice.   Dessert was spectacular: homemade flan, baklava, and rice pudding. The retsina didn't taste as much like turpentine as I hear it usually does.  I loved George, the owner. He told me he loved me within two minutes of entering the restaurant. To be fair, I came as the guest of two of his favorite customers...  I will definitely eat here again.

After an AMAZING bottle of Greek wine and saganaki, my dad decided it was so good, we got another order. After the soup and salad, which are always perfect at getting me ready for my entree with out filling me up, I got my Scallops Yanni (I think that's what they're called). They were AWESOME. Lightly floured and sauced just right, I was in heaven.   My mom, a sucker for mousaka, was totally overcome. I mean, even though the standard was set between the saganaki, soup, salad and wine, it still surprises you. Should anything taste so good? I don't know, I didn't think so anyway. Otherwise, what do I have to look forward to next time? I mean, who hasn't had disappointing mousaka? There are so many places you can go wrong: overly mushy eggplant, runny bechamel or bland meat. Well, you won't find that at Greektown, especially the meat. It's ground a little course and spiced EXACTLY right.  Oh, and not to kiss the owner's butt even more, but he's an awesome guy. If you like a show with your dinner, don't miss Greektown. He'll crack you up.",

Rarely my boyfriend and I get to go to lunch together and we don't even question where we are going anymore, its Greektown.  George, the owner, is here 7 days a week.  I know some other reviewers have taken some issue with him, but he is a genuine, hard working guy who just wants to make his customers happy!    Dont judge the book by its cover.  The surroundings are weird, but once you get inside you forget about the area and enjoy the nice decor and quiet, pleasant atmosphere.  The first time we went, we tried to order some random appetizer, and George insisted we get the Calamari.  I thought this was weird for someone to do, but he was right.  It was not only amazing, but to this day the best calamari I have ever had.  So fresh, we lick up every bite with the pita and garlic bread (and I am usually one to try and not eat everything in a meal)  I almost always have the Greek Salad with Gyro meat.  The veggies are fresh and delicious.  I always leave happy not only enjoying the taste, but seeing someone work so hard and genuinely care about their business and take a really active part in it.  If you can get up here, it is absolutely worth it.",

I have had a bit better in Greektown Chicago, but not very much better.  I think the highlights of my recent meal in north Phoenix were the Avgolemono (Greek Lemon Chicken Soup) and the Kalimari (octopus) sauteed in garlic (lots of it), butter, and olive oil.  The soup was really really good and the kalimari was unlike anything I have eaten before and was outstanding.  Prices were very reasonable.    Now, as to some critical comments about the personality of the owner (George), I mean COME ON!!  People, get over yourselves.  George is interesting, opinionated, knowledgeable in a lot of areas, blunt and forthright, and does not suffer fools gladly.  My kinda guy.  If you do not like that, then maybe you should move to someplace like LA or San Francisco where obsequious behavior (look it up) is acceptable and expected.",

Also, very impressive and reasonably priced wines. Atmosphere would have been better if they had closed the blinds offering the view of the neon \"Jiffy Lube\" but the booths are cozy and comfortable (far better than the tables). Service started off good though wishing our waiter had on a long sleeve collared shirt vs the logo t-shirt.  He made recommendations for beverages and wine and offered some good menu suggestions then disappeared for the balance of the evening.  Thank goodness for the lovely woman who cleared out plates, took our dessert order and made us feel welcome.  Wish I had gotten her name. The owner?  Other than asking us to \"like their Facebook Page\" on our way out the door barely welcomed or noticed us...too busy fawning over his regular guests to welcome new ones I suppose. Back to the food... Bread basket was outstanding! Greek Salad arrived with our meals (not before hand) and looked like a tired left over banquet salad...just tired looking and unimpressive. Same with he lentil soup starter (included w/ the meal)...honestly, looked like something right out of a can. The Gyros Platter...what is up w/ dumping French Fries on top?!?!  UGH The Shrimp was nicely done and all good arrived steaming hot!  A bonus. We would give this another try with the hope of better service, a genuine/warm welcome, and select different entree.",

    "text": "Phenomenal--George is full of personality and has put together such an authentic and welcoming Greek restaurant experience!  It's a little surprising from the outside and surrounding area but upon entering it was like we stepped right into a restaurant in Greece, heavily decorated and playing traditional Greek music.  George was incredibly hospital--it was like we had entered his home.  He loves what he does, and that passion is apparent in the recipes he serves with the highest integrity.  Everything we ate was delicious and some serious comfort food (literally, we were in a food coma by the end).  I can't wait to return to try the baklava cheesecake and the calamari people raved about... We loved the lamb, saganaki (OPA!!), and the tiropitakia!  Those of you who have Greektown in your neighborhood are spoiled--I would be there all the time!",

Ordered saganaki to start, it was stringy and after two chews it seemed like gum in your mouth.  Ordered mousaka and petitiso, arrived room temperature.  We basically went here for the mousaka. Mousaka was mediocre at best.  Asked for a sangria, it seemed that the owner added fruit juice to a red wine and charged $8.95 Won't go back or recommend to others!",

The kalamari would have been ok if not drenched in sauce, but they were tasty. The dessert - which was pushed on us, despite the fact we said we didn't care for any, was WAY too much. Cheesecake, topped with baklava, accompanied by white chocolate mousse. Sorry, but it was disgustingly way too sweet. Just one elegant piece of baklava would have been enough. Worst of all, the owner thinks he being charming. But he is loud and obnoxious and pushy. There were nearly 40 people in the restaurant when I went, and the owner was taking orders, serving food, and clearing entirely by himself. My date wanted a glass of pinot, which they had, but he insisted on giving her something he personally felt was better. Totally obnoxious know-it-all.  When I spend $40-50 on a meal - I want somebody to be kind and gracious. Not overbearing.",

We walked in and were greeted by happy, smiling staff. Which is always a positive.   As I looked around, it had a very fancy but laid back feel. Candles were lit, they had nice table-clothes, it was super pretty.   There was a man walking around checking up on each table and cracking jokes (I assume the owner), who added character to the restaurant. It felt very family friendly.   The food was amazing. It had a variety of choices and very good prices considering the quality of the food.   I will be returning and recommending to every Greek lover!",

This isn't it.   Egg lemon soup. Should be thick, yellow colored and rich lemon flavored.   Nope...it's chicken and rice soup like out of a can with a squeeze of lemon.   I had the gyros sandwich on a pita. Came with a side salad with one Kalamata olive and some feta cheese on top. Hardly Greek salad.   Gyros was good, but they put the fries IN the sandwich. Really?  How about \"on the side\"?  My wife had the chicken George. Decent with egg lemon (too thin) sauce and artichokes and mushrooms. Greek potato. And zucchini and carrots?  Are you kidding?  What happened to Greek style green beans?  Nope.   The $5 Pinot Grigio was good...but pinot?  No rodititis?    Finally, the only dessert option is baklava cheesecake.   We passed.   The owner is sociable and they break dishes and yell \"Opa\"!  That's probably the only good part.   The food is not like your yiayia would make and it's in a dicey part of Phoenix.   Won't return.

The standard Greek dishes are to die for, we love the calamari, the Capama ( lamb shank), the Musaka, spanakopita, saganaki, domales, etc. We also love the chicken and seafood dishes, too!   Our family loves to come to Greektown to eat the wonderful food and visiting with George and his family!",

We have been to Greektown on North 7th Street in Phoenix many times for dinner over the years. This time we went for lunch. The restaurant was almost empty except for one other table. If you enjoy listening to ranting from the owner, you will get a large portion along with your meal. The rantings from this one-time immigrant are political, somewhat racist, and terribly disturbing. We were totally embarrassed, as our son-in-law is of Mexcian heritage. He politely swallowed these disturbing comments, as we ate our lunch. The restaurant has been at this location for a long time. How surprising that this kind of rhetoric is served along with a meal!!! The owner needs sensitivity training. It looks like common sense isn't so common ... just as Voltaire stated so many years ago! When will 'they' ever learn?",

George will make sure you have everything you need and take care of you the whole time you're there. He runs and really cares about his business and it shows. It may not look like much from the outside but don't let that deceive you, the inside is very cozy and nicely decorated. Very dim and private high booths. Great for a quite family dinner or a romantic evening. We will be back for sure",

Apparently, the owner thinks that he can charge people the price of the highest-cost entree on his menu and multiply that by the number of people dining when serving the \"ethnic plate.\" How is this justified? The \"ethnic plate\" was clearly not made up of only the most expensive menu items.  On the bright side, the eccentric owner was still extremely entertaining and accomodating. When I requested extra bread to take home, he presented us with a nice-sized stack of fresh pitas. Also, our dessert sampler was delightful and included nice-sized portions.  I would return, but would be more careful about asking the exact price of any specials before ordering.",

George, the owner, is full of life and enthusiasm and banter.  Half the fun of going to Greektown is interacting with George.  This place is my go-to spot for business lunch meetings in the central corridor. The booths are large and offer privacy, and the place is quiet enough for conversation.  And Greektown serves the best Greek food in the valley.  I don't go anywhere else.",

    "text": "I stopped going to this place quite a while ago, but haven't had the chance to put up a review and explain why.   First and foremost, this place is in decline. I went there for a couple of  years, especially when I worked in the area, and it has gotten more an more vacant with each visit. I didn't understand why, given all the awards they have littering the dinning area, but I have come to realize that no matter how good your food is, poor service will be the end of you every time. Such is the case with Greek Town.   The owner, George, is borderline obnoxious. I don't know if this is a culture thing or what, but he seems to be able to offend just about anyone in your party at some point. Sadly, at the same time, he and his wait staff have no clue about proper service, a fact that appears to be well reflected in other reviews here. I have many, many times, had my drinks run out, ran out of pita/bread for dipping and so on, all the while the restaurant is practically deserted. When you have three servers to support an restaurant that small, and empty, you have no excuse for that kind of abandonment of a table.   Furthermore, George and everyone else in that place seem to be brusk and snobbish. I used to be given a run down of the dinner/lunch specials when I was seated, but more often than not in the last half dozen visits or so, I had to ask what the special was. That wouldn't be so bad, but the response I got was almost an eye-rolling vibe, as if I'd made some horrible offense by asking what the daily special was.   Secondary to the service problem is the food. My earlier visits were flawless, but more recent ones have been replete with problems. I get gyros delivered with empty bowls of dressing on the plate. Empty bowls on the plate, how does that get past the person checking the food? How does it get past the server? The preparer? Nobody catches this, really? And before you ask,  yes, even George himself brought food to my table this way.   Furthermore, I've gotten actual bad food there in recent visits. Calamari that was still pink and uncooked, for starters, how gross is that? Other times it has started to come out very soggy and spongy, rather than the crisp taste I'm used to from much earlier visits. Going back to the service problem, when George and his staff saw that we didn't touch the calamari, nobody asked and nobody cared. For the way they price it, I find it unacceptable that you bring me raw, pink calamari (soggy at that!).   All in all, I finally grew tired of the behavior of the staff, the ridiculous level of service and the fact that now, even the food was in decline. I can handle so-so food or so-so service, but I can't take both of them from the same place. Discussed with my wife and decided to find a new Greek place to dine at, so we're never returning to Greek Town.   It's a True shame, as the ambiance and the decor, the nice booths and the quiet atmosphere really, really won me over initially. I used to love this place and went there often with colleagues from work and with my family. I'm sad to see them go and to strike them off my list, but they've been given enough chance and nothing has changed. My personal prediction? They'll be out of business within a year if they keep this up.",

It was an exceptional cheesecake but also a little different than the usual cheesecake.  Guessing there is Greek yogurt in there but not sure.  Anyways, delicious!        This is a family run place so in my book that is a plus.  We left payment and tip on the table and left.

Not only was Greektown authentic, but it has such a wonderful ambiance, mainly due to the genuine and charismatic owner George.  He made a run of the mill lunch truly memorable.    We ordered too much food but didn't regret any of it.   George recommended the calamari, said it was the best in town and I'm sure he is right.  And Opa!  Cheese Saganaki, the kids were hooting and hollering over the fire and our picky three-year old ate half the dish.  The lamb gyro was tasty, Greek salad had tangy dressing and a nice change of pace from a French fries side.  But you can't stop here, the baklava covered cheesecake, the best! Not a bite left with constant \"more more more\" from the kids.   Topped off with an ouzo shot (thanks George) made the meal complete.    Doesn't get much better than this. Thank you George (and his chef wife) for making our day.  We will see you next Spring Break!",

Also, George was in good humor and we enjoyed his wit.  The non-lamb dishes were pretty good. No complaints. However both lamb dishes had the same issues: 1. small meal 2. more bone than meat 3. tough meat 4. a more or less empty plate.  My plate was lamb served over a very small amount of rice with gravy. It had one bone cut to the same shape as the meat. Vivien's plate was lamb served with gravy. It had two bones cut to the same size as the meat.",

This is absolutely one of the best places in Phoenix to dine. If you have people visiting, this is one of the gems that proves the city has more to offer than pretty scenery.

I don't have any major complaint with service though.  I ordered the veal plate, which was OK, but quite expensive for just two seriously thin slices of veal. More importantly though, the veal was not cooked great; it was tough and the fat wasn't broken down at all. Veal needs to be cooked carefully, and when it is, it is amazing. But this just wasn't. The sauce and veggies on the plate were perfect, and wonderfully homely & greek! And as others have mentioned, the baklava cheesecake with the white chocolate mousse..oh man - what an amazing desert. I will probably come back just for this.  All in all I don't think it's a bad place, and I'll probably be back at some point - I'll just stick to the cheaper plates as the over $20 plates just aren't worth it IMO.",

I told the waiter and owner that we had a mobile Entertainment coupon and they said fine.  In fact, the owner never really looked at the coupon to see any terms and conditions.  I just said it said 10% off.  They honored that more so on my word than being picky about the coupon.  They seated us in a booth at the far end of the restaurant away from other people, which is what my husband wanted.  The decor was nice, friendly and clean.  The ambiance was nice and the tables had nice tablecloths and cloth napkins - a place that is nicer than what we normally go to.  The owner was very friendly and energized, gave us personal attention without being overbearing.  The booths were big so my husband and I could snuggle together, but eat without bumping our arms into each other.  We were glad to leave a good tip and glad we made the trip up to north Phx for this restaurant.  The owner is from Manhattan New York.  I never got the chance to ask if he was Greek or not, but the food was really good.  We would come back again.  The restaurant from the outside didn't look too great, but the inside was fine.  If we are in the area again, we'll go eat there again.  Service is really important and though the food was a little pricier than what we normal buy, we'd come here without a coupon just because there is not only good food, but good service with a smile!  We loved that the portions were just right and not super size me large.",

The decor looks like something that needs to be on Restaurant Impossible for redos.  A little pitcher on our table (perhaps olive oil?) was missing it's handle and chipped on the lip.   The gyros were bleh - the meat was a little slimey - didn't have that crisp edge you get from a carved gyro - the meat slices were super thick too.  Side salad was a warm, dressing-soaked mess.   They were out of straws - and the \"hilarious\" owner George said that was the new style.  (He was just shy of rude the rest of the time).  The spanikopita was hot and looked inviting, but seemed to be filled with a big glop of unseasoned frozen spinach (and no cheese).",

    "text": "Coming to Greektown is always an experience. Straight from the first time we came in and everytime since, its always part spectacle and part amazing food. The place is family run, and the wife is clearly one of the main cooks. She's very quiet and soft spoken compared to her husband and son. The food is some of the most authentic Greek that I have ever tasted, and the family has no issues giving suggestions.   When you are seated, you're served an order of mixed breads which all of them are very yummy, and I would suggest not filling up on them since their meal portions are HUGE. They also offer a wide selection of both imported and domestic beers, liquors, and wines; many of which are actually from Greece. Though I'll warn you against the Ouzo which is a jager/absinthe like spirit served in a shot that can be quite unpleasant for the faint of heart. The Greek lagers on the other hand are quite light and refreshing and pair well with whatever you order.  I go for their gyros, which are by far the hugest and most tasty in town. My boyfriend is addicted to their dolmades, which unlike many dolmades you'll find at other restaurants, are full of meat. And trust me, you may not think you'll be full off just an order of stuffed grape leaves but somehow these things manage to be really filling. Especially if you order the meal, which comes with a soup of the day and a salad, both of which have always been delicious. Though my one gripe is that the olives aren't pitted, so watch out. And the dolmades themselves, apart from being stuffed with meat, are also served in a delicious and delicate sauce that pairs perfectly with the dish.  The place is family run and the owner makes it a point to sit and chat with each table, often times pulling up a chair alongside the table and making sure every meal was exactly to the customers' liking. The place is great for large groups and parties though that does mean it can get pretty loud. Its not uncommon to hear the whole place yell out an \"opah!\" if anything breaks. It does close down in the afternoon for a few hours before the dinner rush so beware what time you're thinking of trying this place out, but never worry about finding parking as their lot is quite spacious.  And finally, do yourself a favor and get the baklava cheesecake, which is a wonder of engineering apart from being incredibly delicious. If you dont have space in your stomach after gorging on their amazing food, take it to go, and trust me, you will thank me.",

My wife and I walked in on an early weekday evening, and were immediately seated.  We decided to order all nine appetizer dishes to get a variety of foods and to sample the menu.  This was a reasonable way to do so, but we also left with three boxes of leftovers -- the orders are plentiful.  While my wife just drank water, I ordered a Greek red wine, which was full bodied and tasty.  The owner's family owns four vineyards in the Corinth area of Greece, and the wines onsite are representative of the annual harvests there.   We didn't get to the dessert because we simply didn't have enough room for any, but were told that the baklava cheesecake is very good.    If you don't mind the story-telling, theater and back and forth between customers and owners, then you'll love this experience.  If you want a quiet place for romance or to read a book, better try something else.  It was an easy and pleasurable choice for us.    The spincah-filled version of the spanokopita was particularly tasty as was the horiotaki table salad.   But all items were enjoyable,  Just download the menu sfor a full explanation of what goes into each dish.    There is a parking lot next to the restaurant which sits on the side of a busy two-way street.",

Ultimately I'm choosing to give it 2 stars, for great food amid a experience marred beyond repair by the crazy owner.  By \"crazy\" I mean shouting, smashing plates, barking orders at customers as they walk through the door.... In the first few minutes I was 50/50 on turning around and walking out but decided to interpret the man's actions as \"Friendly guy with different cultural understanding of boundaries\" rather than \"Scary heroin addict who's barely holding it together right now.\" Multiples times throughout the evening we both wondered if we'd made the right choice. At a booth near us the family's two kids spent most of their visit hiding under the table in fear.  The fatal blow against us wanting to return came toward the end of our meal, when we were considering whether to stay for dessert. We'd managed to find the lighter side of all the craziness up until that point. But then the owner pulled up a seat at our table and launched into a diatribe about the country my wife's ancestors come from. As she started to school him on how ignorant and offensive the things he just said were, he backtracked and insisted he \"couldn't be racist\" because he \"lived in [that country]\" for a time himself. His story rang False and did not excuse what he said. We nope'd out of there right away.",

The main server and I believe the owner was very hands on with customers, which to me was a different experience. I felt as the decor didn't really match the customer service, because the server was very hands on. It reminded me of a pizza shop in NY or Italian type of family atmosphere. There's nothing wrong with that, but when I'm going in there to just eat and then get up and go, the server got involved and I guess if you're not used to it or if you're an introvert this place isn't probably where you want to go.  Now, the food was great. I got a Gyro, and of course that's something default, but then again it was a lunch and it was a bit of a drive back. I also ordered a salad, and I could have gotten a salad with the Gyro but the server persuaded me to get both, a salad and some fries. In the end though, we were pretty much in and out and the food came quickly. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for greek food.",

If your loud enough he will hear you from the bar. Plates get thrown and break and everyone yells Opa!!  The Teeropeetess, Saganaki Flambeau, Pasteetso, Dolmades were all delicious. The chicken George was ok. The Greek gyros platter was delicious as well as the gyro sandwich. We had the baklava cheesecake for dessert- not one bite was left. Next time I want to try some other items on the menu. Fun had by all - we will be back.",

Besides Whataburger I despise chain places, there is no love or care for the food or customer. This is a generational place, the services knew the regulars and there were multiple family members working here which shows a love for these they do. The staff all were fun; knowledgeable, and willing to explain everything being served. Mediterranean food is my favorite so I'm very judgmental about it, EVERYTHING surpassed any expectation I've ever had. Don't let the outside of the building fool you; stop in here any chance you get!",

It's everything I would want in an authentic Greek restaurant. Def recommend the dolmades they come with an amazing lemon sauce. The gyros meat was so full of flavor!!

    "text": "We were actually on our way to a different restaurant, when my wife saw this little hideaway on the east side of 7th street. She coyly suggested that we should give it a try, and that's all that was required for me to make a quick U-turn in busy traffic.  We had no reservations, and didn't know what to expect. But, it was to be a new experience and we have always up for the challenge of discovering new places to dine.  The moment we walked in, we heard the word \"Opa\" yelled out, followed by everyone clapping.   That's a good sign, right?   Then the owner noticed us, greeted us with a big smile, and has us sit down at the bar for a few moments so that someone could get a table ready for us.   He also took our drink order, and promptly got those for us.   Note that barely a minute has passed and we are already being taken care of, in spite of the fact that the place was packed.   This was definitely looking up already. Festive, quaint, friendly, and prompt.   These are often good introductory signs for a restaurant.  Shortly thereafter, he informed us that our seats were ready, and I grabbed my wife's water and diet coke so that she doesn't have to carry it herself.   The owner took notice and complimented me on being a such a gentleman to the Nth degree. (When have I ever been NOT a gentleman to her? LOL)  We were presented with the menu by one of the servers, and the evening's specials were explained to us. Our server took a few moments to also answer our questions about the restaurant since we were befuddled that we never took notice of it before. And we have driven past this place countless of times.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Spanakopites. This was comprised freshly baked Filo Dough that were stuffed with Spinach, Feta Cheese, and Onions. This particular appetizer was both warm, amazingly flaky and flavorful! It didn't take long before it was consumed in its entirety.  For the main course, I had the Baked Salmon with steamed vegetables. My wife had the Pateetso, which a Greek version of Lasagna.   My Salmon was very well seasoned and quite delectable. My wife commented that her Lasagna was a wonderful combination of cheese, meat, and layered lasagna noodles. Every aspect of the lasagna, from its outer layer to its inner contents, were distinctly flavorful.  Amidst our enjoyment of the amazing dishes that were presented to us, we also enjoyed the occasional revelry by the guests and the owner. And just when I had commented to my wife that the festivities brought back memories of restaurant that I had eaten at on the Isle of Burano by Venice, less the smashing of plates; we then hear the owner smashing some plates on the other side of the restaurant and everyone yelling - OPA!  We were so very glad that we decided to venture out and discover this gem of a restaurant this particular evening.",

    "text": "Oh, how we wanted to like Greektown.  The owner is personable, is outgoing and really keeps his finger on the pulse of his restaurant. Its a 2ng generation place, has been in this location for 20 years,  and has the 3rd generation working behind fhe bar.  We started our dinners with a traditional greek salad.  The greens were fresh, the olives had a great salty bite, and they were generous with the feta cheese (and warm pita bread, thick and delicious.  Had our dinner ended here, we would have left happy.  BUT -We had a spanakopita  - the filling was ok, but the crust was soggy and dense.  Then we came to the Gyro. You can't go wrong with a Gyro at a greek restaurant, right?  Well, greektown got it very wrong.  It's not their fault they ran out of the traditional spicy garlicky beef lamb mixture. But they told us they had a pork version gyro that is the way they make it in Greese.  I can't dispute that, but what they served was alternately fatty or charred, and neither part had any flavor.  I was very disappointed, I should have sent it back, but struggled through about half before signaling for the check.  Most of the other diners seamed to enjoy their food, so maybe we ordered wrong? But for us, this was only a 3 star experience.",

    "text": "Choosing to come here has been a long time coming. Everyday we drive by this restaurant during our carpool on the way home from a hard days work. Finally, today my husband and I decided to stop for a Mediterranean salad to go. Upon walking in our plans immediately changed. I loved the offer of a glass of red or white wine for the day for a mere $6 Vista Point twist cap to be exact, which ended up being very good! The down home feel made us feel very welcomed and comfortable and what an experience! We loved the ambience, the friendliness, the paintings in place of windows of beautiful Greece, the clean bathrooms and of course the beautiful music and the dancers on the television for entertainment, WOW. But there is a \"but\", although the food was tasty and on-point, price wise we did not appreciate the misunderstanding of the price of the salmon dinner. The chalkboard above us read $19.28 however when we got the bill it was priced $28.00. George the owner, kindly informed us that was the lunch pricing. Suggestion moving forward, alert patrons of the dinner price prior to ordering. My husband later said, he saw it read (past tense) lunch specials on the chalkboard, I of course didn't but I did enjoy two nice glasses of red wine. To give the owners the benefit of the doubt, moving forward and because we loved George's service so much, we will be back. Food so good like this, succulent salmon, fresh pork med salad and pita pork cheese quesadilla one has to look over the minutia's of pricing right? Thanks George and his beautiful wife for a nice unexpected weekday dinner, we will be back!

The dips were accompanied by perfectly warmed pita bread.  I could've made a meal out of the pita and TaramosSalata, but I had a Greek Salad as well.  It was the perfect lunch portion.

(i won.) no better way to finish a meal if you ask me.",

Contrary to other reviews, I ordered take out and got a hefty portion of everything. We had left overs for the next day.  The soup is amazing and salad is generous... it is even packed in a large container vs. the embarrassingly small ones you see at other take out Greek spots.   We will be coming back for sure!!  (Note: Know what you're getting into, they don't serve shwarma... this is authentic, traditional Greek).",

This time I went and had Chicken George and my friend had the Tortellini with a greek meat sauce she said it was yummy. We had a great dessert also Cheesecake with balklva.

We ordered dinner for 2 and then a to go box for my son and everyone thought the food was great. The only downside is the atmosphere was a little off. I don't like the decor or the table area so we might not bring a group to eat here. And the prices are a tad too high for what you get.

I highly recommend the gyro. The meat is very tender, flavorful and they load it on. The tatziki is very fresh, and has small chunks of cucumber throughout it. The fries are perfectly crisp and seasoned with herbs. Also, the baklava cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever had. The cheesecake is pleasantly tangy which is well balance by the nuts and honey in the baklava. It also comes with a generous portion of fresh whipped cream topped with cinnamon and a honey drizzle.",

The atmosphere is very comfortable and even romantic, with plenty of booth and table seating available (in addition to a bar). I heard quite a bit of Greek being spoken, which is definitely a good sign when it comes to ethnic restaurants.  The calamari appetizer was flavorful and not too chewy (a problem I tend to have with calamari). The dolmades were a perfectly portioned and tasty entree and were cooked to perfection. I had a glass of Greek wine, which was well worth the price ($9).  The owner was also my table's waiter, and he did a fantastic job of creating a friendly and welcoming environment. He was quick with recommendations, and even gave the table a free shot of ouzo after dinner.  It's a family-owned restaurant, and you can tell that they actually want you to have a good time. Greektown is well worth the visit.",

The salad was smaller than what I normally have in a Xoriatiki and didn't have enough feta cheese on it.  The Pastitsio was on point with the bechamel being just the way I like it.  The baklava cheesecake ended the meal just right!  Super rich and delicious.  We will definitely be visiting again!",

I have only been to a couple Greek places but the meat here was mediocre compared to my past experiences. That was the first Greek salad that I have ever had. It was good but it didn't blow me away. For dessert we shared a baklava cheesecake. That was the best part of the meal. It was a really rich so I would recommend sharing. A few bites of it will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.",

    "text": "My husband and I celebrated our 11th anniversary at Greektown.  We found them in the Entertainment book and we love Greek food, so we decided to give it a try.  We had an overall great experience, with a couple of bummers mixed in.  Service:  Very good.  We had a mixture of a server and a server-owner (George).  Both men were very friendly, funny, attentive.  The owner offered to box up my one dolmades that was left and to smother it in the lemon sauce (there was not a lot of sauce left on my plate), which I appreciated.  They know how to sell their restaurant, for sure.  Ambiance:  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was perfect for an anniversary dinner - lit by candles, stained glass windows with Greek themes, really romantic at night.    The food:  1.  Saganaki:  THE BEST we have ever had.  There was a lot of sauce left with the cheese to dip the pita bread in.  On the first bite I was shocked by the taste of the alcohol (151) that was in the sauce, but I got used to it really quickly.  My husband just relished it.  We will come back again and again just for this dish!  2.  Aveglemono:  Lemon soup.  Very good - an opinion by both myself and my husband.  Came free with the meal.  3.  Greek salad:  Good.  Fresh with lots of feta.  The salad dressing was a little heavy / salad a little overdressed.  Free with the meal.  2.  Shrimp George entree:  Half and half on this one.  The flavors of lemon and artichoke were wonderful on this, and the vegetables with the sauce that they use were incredible.  Unfortunately, the shrimp were over-cooked - my husband with the chef's palate say they were REALLY over-cooked.  He said he would try the Chicken George next time.  3.  Dolmades entree:  Half and half on this one:  Again, the vegetables were wonderful.. and to be honest, I am not somebody that loves vegetables.  The dolmades were really unflavorful, unfortunately.  They weren't bad because grape leaves/rice/ground beef is a good combination any way you look at it, but they were probably the worst I have ever had just based on how unflavorful the rice and ground beef were.  The sauce was really good, though.  4.  Custard dessert:  A caramel custard.  My husband liked it.  5.  Baklava ON TOP OF cheesecake:  I really wasn't sure I wanted to try it.  The combination really does work, though!  The cheesecake alone wasn't the best cheesecake and the baklava alone also wasn't the best baklava but together it really was good!  My advice would be for the restaurant to make a sampler  dessert plate and have this dessert  in bite-size format with maybe 5 pieces.  It was amazing at the beginning, but it is really rich.    Overall, we were really pleased with this restaurant.  We would both order different entrees,, but the service/ambiance/saganaki/parts of the various dishes were really incredible.",

When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car...I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not.  Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the owner and were told that we could sit anywhere we'd like.  We chose one of the booths, it was nice and cozy and private.  There were several specials written up on the wall, but they were all meaty, so I took to the menu.  On this particular night, I was hankering for some cheese...don't judge me.  My lady was looking at the Spanikopita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with spinach and feta) and I wanted to get the Tiropita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with feta), as we were trying to decide which one to get, our server (the owner) offered to do half and half for us.  Sweet!!  As we were waiting for the appetizer, he brought us out some fresh pita and tasty garlic bread.  When the app came out, it was piping hot and oh so good!  Came with a side of Tzatziki for dipping, but I just ate mine plain.  For entrees, I ordered the pasta with veggies (tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, red onion) which came with a choice of their tomato sauce or the lemony garlic.  I opted for the lemony garlic.  Our entrees came with little Greek salads, which came out with the meals.  I liked my dish...although I did have to order a side of lemon wedges cause I love things extra tart.  I can't remember exactly what my girl ordered, but I know there was rice and potatoes and tomato sauce, and she ate almost all of it.  The salad was only so so...it had creamy dressing and I wanted a little more punch from it...perhaps a little acid in there to kick it up a bit.  The portions were very generous and we both needed a take out container.  Don't think we stopped there, though!  We ordered the house-made chocolate mousse.  It was DAMN delicious!  We ate every last spoonful.  The owner was a very nice and helpful guy, not too much and not too little.  As I said before, the portions are large and the prices are not.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Greektown after looking for something new as we just moved near the neighborhood from across town. George was awesome, although it seems like he shoots Redbull in his veins (does he ever slow down??) at the start of his day! If you can't make up your mind he'll help make it up for you. I couldn't decide between Souzoukakia and Titans Tortellini and he suggested something I hadn't even considered, the Macaronia Me Keemah as he said \"The Greeks make the best pasta\" and I would have to agree it was wonderful. The meat sauce was so flavorful. It was sweet but just enough spice. My wife got Dolmades and loved it. George suggested I try the Greek beers and I am more of a microbrew guy but for lagers they weren't aren't too bad. We will go back for sure. Quite often if I had my way! The food was awesome, everyone was so nice, the place is inviting and cozy. Even the chairs are pretty comfy after all that food! My new favorite Greek place in town!",

    "text": "I've found it! This is it! The best Greek restaurant in Phoenix! For years now I had been wondering if an excellent Greek restaurant even existed here. Like Bigfoot, it seemed ever elusive, almost as if it didn't want me to find it! Well I found you, you rascal, and I'm not letting you get away. I even took pictures... wait. I didn't take pictures. I forgot. But I swear it exists! I swear it!  What is the deal with most Greek joints, anyway? You go in and you get food made with rice and pork and grape leaves and you get the bill and you're like \"wtf mate?\" Then your wife reminds you that you're not Australian and you get all sheepish... but I digress. Unlike pricier joints around town which will go unnamed, prices here were right in line with what I would expect to pay. A nice touch. Service was a bit slow on the uptake, but once we got our order taken, everything came very quickly. The True star of the show here though, is the food. So delicious!  Until I ate at Greektown, I thought I did not like pita bread all that much. If this is how pita was made everywhere, it would have been one of my favorites since childhood, this stuff is awesome. We ordered dolmades to start, grape leaves stuffed with rice and pork smothered in a light lemon sauce... fabulous. Eye-rollingly so. Seriously. I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken, the yardstick I apply to all my Greek experiences. The salad was competent, but the dressing was very bland. Surprising, considering how tasty everything else was.  Squeezed a bit of lemon over it though, and it came to life - it was AWESOME. The chicken was seasoned and grilled perfectly. Tender and tasty, a True pleasure. It came with a side of tatziki, by the way, very delicious. I was a happy camper. The wife ordered what she described as \"the best gyro I have ever had in my entire life.\" I know that's a tad ambiguous. I try to nail her down on these things, but she INSISTS on being vague. Sorry!  Lastly, everybody is saying it and there's a reason: the guy who runs this place is definitely the ringmaster here, he's very fun and also an excellent server. He is quite obviously enjoying what he is doing, and I applaud his atttude. More to the point, I applaud his food. We will be back again and again.",

Our waiter, who I believe was the owner, was far to overbearing and was borderline offensive.  Maybe I offended him by asking for hummus, but surely he's used to us dumb Americans not knowing the difference between Greek and Mediterranean.  Anyway, he proceeded to make a comparison of the word \"hummus\" to the word \"homos\" in an explanation of why he didn't serve it.  And then he said \"homos - okay, that's a little greek,\" and shrugged.  Whether it was a light hearted joke or a slam doesn't matter to me, because he doesn't know me well enough to joke with me like that.  He made us uncomfortable from his first greeting and we won't be going back.",

There's only one dessert and it's not to be missed!

Service was attentive and at times hilarious, and he talks to you like your family.  He broke a plate by yelling OPA and that was a highlight.

Next time I might ask for dressing on the side though.  - The capama was a bit uneven.  Some pieces of lamb were very tender.  Others, not so much. The sauce was incredible.  Very savory and rich.  - Service was excellent.",

The owner was our waiter and he was so much fun and personable! There was a family celebrating a birthday while we ate and after happy birthday was sung they threw a plate against the wall and everyone said \"OPAAA\" it was so awesome!! We loved it! The food, staff, atmosphere was just 5 star all the way. Oh and we had the cheesecake with a chunk of baklava on the top of it and it was to die for!! So dang good!! This is my new fav place!!

My only complaint would be that there were very few potatoes on my plate AND they were very salty-as if someone had accidentally seasoned them twice. I also wish I had been given a bit more salad.   The owner bought us all a shot of Ouzo to make up for some rough spots in the service and we all left happy.   Before I forget, my friend had the Grexican and RAVED about it.   Anytime someone suggests going there I immediately agree, even though it's a tad pricy for every day for me.  It's a wonderful feeling to go to a restaurant run by a family.  I suggest you go!",

You can't get service like this anywhere else and that's just something you have to experience for yourself. Ask for George and if it's your birthday make sure to tell him! OPA!!  I usually get the Classic Gyro Dinner Platter or Titan's Tortellini with the Greek meat sauce! You get a salad and soup of the day with dinner entrees. My favorite so far is the lentil soup; it's really good.",

He tells this restaurant has been around for 42 years and it's easy to see why.     The Mediterranean Greek Salad with grilled chicken for $11 was my order. Wow! I am truly have left Phoenix for Greece! The lettuce cold and crisp, tomatoes, cucumbers and Kalamata Olives are fab too! Coming back tonight for dinner- it's that good!",

At night it has a low lit ambiance that's romantic combined with the Greek decor. Service can be a little slow b/c they don't have many ppl working there, but they are attentive. I'm willing to give this place another shot b/c the service was very personable, fair-priced, and I like small restaurants that make their own food, but I won't be getting sea food probably again.",

Came in to grab a quick to-go order but stayed to eat the calamari, because as George puts it - \"that's like going to a steak house and taking a steak to go...it's just not the same. Eat the calamari here and I'll make your Chicken George to go.\" Can't argue with the man's logic.   So I did...AND he was right! He also is quite good on the guitar with an amazing voice!  Totally devoured the calamari...(lightly pan fried and covered in a lemony sauce. The marinara sauce matched it perfectly, not making it too salty like most places do.) All the while he entertained while cooking and packing up the rest of my dinner. (Which was also amazing!)   This has to be the best dine in experience I've had in a while. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!",

The ambiance is nice and the food is reasonably priced.    But that's where the praise ends...  We had the calamari (which the waiter raved about) and the eggplant spread.  The eggplant spread was delicious, the best thing we had.  The calamari was covered in a thick sauce which didn't have much flavor and left the calamari soggy without a satisfying crunch.  We both ordered the \"Chicken George\", which like all dinner items came with soup and salad (like I said: a great deal). The soup was ok. Not great.  But ok.  Pretty bland chicken egg drop. The salad was the worst Greek salad I've ever had.  It tasted like ranch dressing.  No olives.  No oregano.  Totally missed the mark.  The Chicken George was covered in a gross buttery sauce.  Again no Greek favors such as garlic or oregano.  A real disappointment.   We won't be coming back.",

Dolmades dinner was listed on-line menu at $13.00 versus $14.00 and was good, not as good as Mikes Grill in Peoria, portion MUCH smaller than Mikes, I wish Mikes was till open, soup & salad included for the both of us.   The server was this wise guy owner from NY, gave no help when asked about some of the other dishes. His answer as he was yelling it across the room, just order it!!, you'll like It!!. What?? LOL... so the atmosphere was comfortable but I would have liked A HELPING HAND when ordering?        So to sum it up, Tuesday night dinner, $45.00 with tip.

His attitude never got better and he reminded me of an escapee from some low class gut bomb restaurant.  He took our order.  My wife had calamares and I had dolomares.  I must say that both (we sampled from each other) were excellent.  Portions were a bit small.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with a small bit of feta sprinkled on it.  No tomatoes or any of the things you'd expect on a green salad.  As I said the dolomares and calamares were very good.  No complains there.  The waiter was as personable as a rattlesnake and when we finished our meal he took all the silver and splashed it down on the plate in front of us and then took the dishes and left. The food was good.  The service was bad in negative numbers.  I think I know why no one else was there.  I know we won't be back.  Thats a shame  because the food was really quite good.",

    "text": "Do not be deceived by the location of this establishment, I guarantee you will not be disappointed when you step into Greektown! We ordered the Kalamari and it was a different side of Calamari I have never seen, because this one was sauced with a lemon-onion herb sauce that was absolutely marvelous! Accompanied with fresh pita bread, which you could use to eat the extra sauce with! I myself had the spaghetti with meat sauce and it was delightful! I was initially a little apprehensive because the meat sauce contains cinnamon... I have to say it was the best meat sauce I have ever had! My boyfriend had the classic gyro and the meat was tender and delicious! But the main show was the baklava cheesecake for dessert! The crispy baklava was a perfect compliment to the creamy cheesecake that melted in your mouth! This is a definite staple of the 7th Street and Dunlap area! I would recommend this place to everyone who enjoys delicious home cooked food!",

This was one of those times. This is a memorable place with very good food and reasonable prices. This is a great find. If I lived in Phoenix I'd be here all the time.",

    "text": "I remember when this used to be a Country Boys restaurant, my bff and I ate eggs and hashbrowns here before going horseback riding for her birthday.  Oh but I digress...this place is boss. Why? Because they don't stop feeding you! You start off with a basket of warm pita bread, and that bread never stops coming. Delightful. After that, a bowl of lemony rice soup that is warm and refreshing at the same time and then your entree. And believe me, everything is good.  The only dish that I have ever been mildly disappointed with was the Moussaka, I wanted to try it and it really wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it was the pureed eggplant.  Not enough for you? My family always asks for an appetizer sampler in which they give you a variety of cheeses, dips and spinach and cheese puffs. I highly recommend it, it's a great way to get to know the food and stuff yourself silly!  Wonderful cozy atmosphere, lovely staff, a great date restaurant. One of my favorites.",

    "text": "You know the phrase \"A Diamond in The Rough\"?  Greektown is that diamond. Nestled in an area where LoLo's would feel right at home, Greektown hardly looks like an amazing restaurant.  However, it is on the inside where the food really shines. The resturant is family owned, with the Mother actually in the kitchen, slaving over traditional dishes such as dolmas, gyros, falafel, and Sweetbreads.  That's right, Sweetbreads. I was warned by the owner when I ordered them, I assume most people do not know that they are the thymus glands of a calf. They were fantastic. Served in a simple tomato sauce, they were cooked to perfection and were warm and filling.   Every meal comes with soup and salad, the soup was a warm lemon soup, it was excellent, I even used the bread to soak up what was left in the bowl. The salad was simple, using feta, kalamatas, and olive oil.  My fiance had the chicken (I forget which ones),but it was some of the most tender and moist chicken ever.  And really, that is the key to this place, the simplicity.  From the throw pillows to the heart-warming and amusing owner, to the fantastic food.  The only thing missing from this place is the ability to toss plates, but then again, when we went, it wasn't super busy.  Opa!",

    "text": "I have been to Greektown about five or six times now and will continue to go back for their consistently delicious, satisfying food.  I've also had the experience of ordering food for take-out which has always been fresh and ready quickly.  As far as I can tell, as an American who has never been to Greece, it is authentic Greek cuisine.  The owners are friendly and welcoming and appear to take pride in what they do.  I continuously order the gyro because it is so tasty, filling, and comes with a yummy little salad.  I have gone with several different people, some very picky, who have all loved it there-- from the food and the service to the charming paintings on the walls. I have also had the delicious calamari which far exceeds the quality found at most restaurants as it is not thickly battered and deep fried to the point where you're not even sure it's calamari at all. Also incredible is the baklava (and I never enjoyed baklava before).  I had it once with cheesecake and it was incredible and took me a couple of days to eat at home because it was rich and filling. Do yourself a favor and try this place.  I am about 99% sure you will be supporting a family rather than a chain and you will get to taste some amazing food which, again, I'm about 99% sure is authentic.",

    "text": "You would be doing yourself a huge disservice by passing up this hidden gem.  The perfect  interplay of light flavors in all the food I've tried so far (spicy lemon chicken, dolmades, calamari, balaclava cheesecake, Turkish coffee)   coupled with the light tab at the end of the meal make Greektown an unforgettable treat.  I moved here from New York and the cheesecake I ate tonight rivals that of Juniors in NYC (I can't explain how rare that is). I'm lucky enough to live close-by, and I've found a new favorite restaurant.",

We enjoyed the Melitsano Salata as an appetizer.    Served with delicious warmed pita bread it is a great way to start out your dinner at Greektown.    George, the owner, is very enthusiastic about his place and what he has to offer.   Take the time to get to know him.  He has lots of stories.  Make sure to ask him about the photo he has of Jimmi Hendrix.    The gyros are great here.  We like the Grexican.  All of the Greek dishes are great.  As George likes to say \"everything is fantastic, you should get it.\"    We go to Greektown often and always enjoy it.  It also seems to be gaining a great reputation as the business there has definitely picked up.  We're very happy it has.  This is a great local business to support!  Greektown is fantastic.  You should go.",

    "text": "I'm a Greek boy from Chicago. Greektown does a terrific job. Outside of my mom's and yiayia's, I don't order Pastitsio in restaurants. Just doesn't come close to what I grew up with. George's ROCKS! Last night I couldn't decide between the Pastitsio and the Lamb Capama, a wine and tomato sauce braised lamb shank. George just brought me out a half order of both. This part comes from my wife, ( I concur) best calamari ever. These folks do a terrific job, soup and salad come with all the dinners as well as pita and garlic breads. Get some saganaki, yell Opah with George as he lights the brandy on your cheese dish, maybe cap off your meal with a good quality ouzo, and leave stuffed and happy. His baklava gives my sister Pam's a run for her money too.",

    "text": "Worst \"Greek\" food I ever had! The service was terrible.  The owner/server was obnoxious and kept running off whenever we were about to order.  I was there with my family on the recommendation of a friend.  One of my family members is Greek and he was very confused by the food. The appetizers were odd.  Calamari was very wide and rubbery. The spanikopita was deep fried. Main courses: My Moussaka consisted of about 5 inches of bechamel on top of dry potatoes with about 1/2 a teaspoon of eggplant, no meat. The veggies on the side were carrots and more potatoes that were dry and not edible. My Mom's leg of lamb was so over done and salty she had to return it. The salad was swimming in dressing. My cousin's eggplant Parmesan was decent as were the lamb chops that my Mom got as a substitute. Even the dessert, Baklava on cheesecake (which the owner practically threw onto the table) was soggy and terrible. Now that it is the morning after, my 10 year old son woke up with diarrhea which may or not be related to his dinner. It is hard to believe a place like this can remain open at all.  It is that bad. I will never go back.  I will, however, return to the Golden Greek where I know I can get good Greek food.",
