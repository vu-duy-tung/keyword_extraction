The waitress walked by 6 or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact.  Finally we had to leave to pick up our kids, not having eaten, not having had any sort of good service.  The waitress couldn't fathom why we would leave after having already been there about an hour.  I have eaten here before and it has decent food but I won't be wasting anymore of my time here.  The complete lack of an attempt at service or even acknowledging the lack of it is inexcusable in a service industry with so many options.  Hana has better Sushi/Japanese and is very near by on 7th ave.",

They took the philly roll off happy hour and the Vegas roll, long story short the \"good stuff\" was eliminated off the happy hour menu. They are already stingy with the rolls as it is (extremely small rolls even smaller pieces of salmon per bite) and on top of that they're not available on happy hour, crazy! I have no problem with paying if it was good sized portions or at least quality fish but nope. Only giving it 3 stars because *some* of the staff is very friendly and the establishment itself is clean and cute. Other than that I'm not sure I'll be back soon and I will think twice before eating here again. Much rather go to Moira sushi in Downtown Phx their happy hour menu is awesome as well as the hours from 5-7pm on weekdays and weekends 9pm to 2 am",

However, there was a really bad odor when I walked in so I opted against trying the fish there out of fear of food poisoning. I can't comment on how the sushi is at Moto. Instead, I decided to try the Pho. I have eaten Pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. Not at Moto. The broth was a darker color than I am used to and had a funny after taste. I couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before I lost my appetite.   Most of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either. My advice is that there are too many other places near Moto for good sushi and pho to risk trying this place.",

Every single time I have been here, the wait staff is highly distracted and it takes a long time for them to come check on tables. Is it because they are short staffed or not really interested in customer service? I shouldn't have to wait every visit for my water glass to be refilled. Good food, not so great on the service.",

I may have a new favorite! Fantastic atmosphere and always spectacular service. It's probably one of the best places to meet for lunch or have a nice dinner.

Mine you she is super busy, ( I have a habit of paying attention to things going on around me) we placed our started right away with her with 2 waters while we looked at the menu. I noticed the wings we ordered sat in the window, she pushes them aside to make our drinks, two other people including what I believe was the manager, guy finally helped the bartender get water for guest coming in. While the other young lady/server pushed our wings to the side and proceeded to grab food behind the wings and take the food to the assign table/person. What pissed me off was why not help each other and deliver the food. When our wings did reach our table, they arrived COLD!!!! I sent it back, and decided to cancel my whole order. I'm writing this review so the employees at this establishment see it, and work to make things right. Help each other out when it's busy. Don't lose customers!! You sure did lose 2 today!!! I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "I've been on a hiking kick lately and am trying to find different ones to try.  Decided to try Piestewa Peak (or Squaw Peak depending on who you ask) but was going to meet up with a friend for lunch beforehand and we found Moto not too far away.  I got there first, a little before 11 which is when they open.  There were a couple people waiting but nothing outrageous.  I walk in and get acknowledged right away by the bartender who lets me know that someone will be right up to seat me and sure enough, as he was finishing that statement the waitress came over and took me to a table.  She also brought me water right away which always makes me happy.  While I was waiting for my friend to show up I read over the menu and was super excited to find out that not only do they have All You Can Eat Sushi, but that it was happening RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT!!  Apparently it's on Saturdays from 11-2:30 and there's 10 different rolls you can choose from for $18.99 (there are some nigiri options too but I don't remember how many there were to choose from for those).  Once my friend showed up I quickly told him about the All You Can Eat special so then he perused the menu to see which ones he wanted.  Our waitress kind of went MIA at this point so that was a little annoying but she seemed to be the only server there so I can't fault her for that but seriously you would think that the management there would keep the place a little bit better staffed on a weekend day during an all you can eat special.  Once our waitress came by for our order my friend got the Tootsi Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Alaska Roll.  I decided that I probably didn't want to binge on sushi right before a hike so I stuck with a single Rainbow Roll.  They took a little bit of time to come out but then again sushi typically does and I'm sure everyone who was in the restaurant was ordering tons of different rolls.  I was happy with the size, the rolls were larger than most places but not so huge that you had a hard time eating a piece.  My Rainbow Roll was delicious!  All the ingredients were fresh and beautiful.  I'll admit I did share one piece of my friend's Vegas Roll (sharing is against the rules according to the menu...oops!) and it was pretty good.  Not the best Vegas Roll I've had but still good.  I'll definitely be coming back here again on another Saturday when I don't plan on hiking so that I can actually partake in the All You Can Eat!",

My server/bartender was Rebecca and she was knowledgable about the beer and food, as well as friendly. She made suggestions about what to try, but only based on my preferences, and never pushy. I don't eat a lot of sushi but I was very satisfied with my Las Vegas roll. Rebecca did admit that it was only her second day (never would have guessed) so I'm hoping that means the owners are taking action on the previously bad service reviews. I will certainly eat there again.",

This place just likes to overcook everything... But that's not why this place sucks. The service i got here was just terrible. Nobody greeted me even tho three workers were clearly present behind the bar. I ordered to go and they made me wait five mins before even acknowledging me. I was actually having to debate waving them down! Eventually the girl came to greet me at the register. She was unable to do two things at once and gave an ice tea cup priority over me after making we wait for her attention. She counted my change wrong and I had to ask for the extra dollar she forgot about. At least she didn't question her mistake. This place seems like it has potential in the food and I would come back if they would stop over cooking everything. But the service is unacceptable and needs work. For this reason, if I ever came back here I would give extra time for my order and come in expecting to count my change and be forced to wait for a to go order that was already sitting at the counter ready to go.",

We had the fish tacos (panko-breaded salmon) and a shrimp tempura roll.  The tacos were pretty yummy, although I thought the \"guac\" was rather interesting - they must use green peas to make the (expensive) avocado go further.  It wasn't bad... just different.  We added the sweet potato fries for just an extra buck... good call! They were deliciously crispy, sweet, and salty. Mmm.  The tempura roll was a little underwhelming.  First off, it was approximately 2 inches in diameter.  Now, I'm not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but I couldn't fit an entire piece in my mouth... and it is WAY to hard to eat half a piece, you know?  They used carrot in the roll... which wouldn't have been a problem, except for it was large chunks of carrot (the size of half a baby carrot).  It was really distracting from the texture I expect in a tempura roll... they should just call it a Carrot Roll, since that is all you notice with that big ol' crunch!   All-in-all, it was a pleasant lunch with pleasant service.  A few tweaks to the food would help bump it up in my book.",

    "text": "Having not been to Moto in a couple of years, my girlfriend Karen an I recently made a return visit specifically for the all-you-can-eat sushi special. The first thing I noticed was that my favorite, eel nigiri, was replaced by smoked salmon on the all-you-can eat menu; strike one. Despite this, we both ordered the special. I opted for the additional sake bomber while Karen had a bottle of Sapporo. Now, the sushi was never spectacular in past visits, but the price was reasonable for the limited selection. But it was hard to reconcile the three dollar increase since our last visit;strike two. On a positive note the smoked salmon nigiri was actually VERY good. Unfortunately, that was the ONLY positive to this experience. The server was attentive enough though we felt rushed (we didn't reorder anything). When I got the check, I discovered that A)While I was only charged an additional three dollars for the sake bomber (22oz. Sapporo and a small sake), I was charged the full $5.00 for Karen's lone 22oz Sapporo. B)There was a 20% gratuity included in the bill.(I don't know if it was policy or the server was feeling especially generous with my money):strike three. I did not raise the issue with the check because we didn't really miss the two bucks though Karen might have liked to have had the sake also, And I would've tipped 20% anyway as is usually my practice when I receive adequate service though it is very presumptuous to automatically assume we received adequate service. Ultimately, there are too many other places where we can go to get adequate sushi and adequate service without being milked for an extra few bucks. Therefore we will not be returning to Moto as it is no longer in competition for our dining dollars.",

I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking \"skinny\" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it.

It made me wonder why they were just hanging out on a week day in the middle of the afternoon...but they are lucky I guess. Oh the food: I started with miso soup and edamame (both hard to mess up), they were good. I ordered a tempura shrimp roll...it was okay, the end pieces had the parts you don't eat so there were only like four pieces.  Overall it was okay and one of the only sushi places by my office (now that I work nearby) so I'll probably be back.  I'm open to recommendations...but I've definitely been to plentyyyy of better sushi spots.  Ohhh and the parking lot is a nightmare -- whether you're trying to run into Subway or Moto this shopping center is sheer chaos during lunch especially.",

Sweet potato fries (Japanese? I don't think so) and calamari (very small).  I ordered a sushi combo which had both sushi and sashimi for a very reasonable price.  The person next to me had one of their bowls.  It was delicious.  I kept asking if I could try it again (that is so rude), but it really was good.  Some kind of spicy chicken bowl. I also had a beer that was really good.  I don't remember the name, but it was delicious.   I will be back for sure, to check out some of their other dishes.",

For around 22 bucks you get a sake bomb and all you can eat rolls and nigiri of a preselected group.  You can chose from around 9 or so basic rolls and half a dozen choices of nigiri.  It really was half decent.  The staff was a bit rude but the rolls were good enough to have a few.  If you are looking for knock out sushi and the whole authentic Japanese experience I would not recommend coming here.  But if you are looking for a decent deal and to have a drink and good enough sushi this is the place.",

We waited 15minutes before the server \"noticed\" us (she was busy talking to coworkers). We ordered some sushi and spring rolls. The sushi is cheap and skimpy, spring rolls were bland. We ate less than 1/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers). With no more to drink and sitting, waiting to get help for 1/2 hour, the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else. We said \"no\" because nothing was good. She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table. We were comped a good portion of the bill, but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it. Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served, we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal. We will not be back.  In summation, the food was poor quality, the service was awful, management is mia. No idea how this place stays open.",

I retract my previous comment about HH beers. I've noticed they heavily rotate their beer list for happy hour, which I love. A lot of the stuff on offer I have never heard of. Very strong beer list, check it out. Impressive.  Service is consistently very good, too. Definitely an all star team. Attentive and friendly every time, can't find that very often nowadays.

It tastes like the product of hard work and a lot of time, like maybe one of those recipes that's a 26-step process with hours to rise/chill/whatever in between. It's not too salty, and has the perfect blend of spices. If this soup were a person, it would be the guy who hardly speaks, but when he does the few words he says make a lasting impact.   The wontons themselves are average, they could stand to be a little bigger. But they are supported by the magical broth. I am noting that the next time I catch a cold, I'm ordering a big bowl of Moto's wonton soup for pickup!",

We waited for 40 minutes for take out food (2 Moto salads) and it was clear that there was a staffing/management issue.  The person at the desk never came out proactively to explain the delay and I had to go back up three times to get better attention to the order.  To make matters worse, the food was not good which is highly unusual but nevertheless very disappointing.  I assume the inferior quality of the outcome (food) was a result of trying to rush the meal preparation after alerting management 3X that I had been waiting for an unusually long time.  I hope this experience is an anomaly but for now, I will be gun shy to come back any time soon.  All the best!",

I stopped by for lunch this afternoon and ordered some nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, tuna) and a few rolls (spicy yellowtail and Kalifornia [yes, they have a version spelled with a \"k\"]). Pretty standard fare and definitely nothing too exotic.   The yellowtail looked as if someone had intended to throw it away until I ordered it (then someone there must have decided, \"Why throw it away when we can serve it to this guy instead!\"). It was dry, rubbery, obviously spoiled and rancid. The spicy yellowtail was even worse. It might have been even older than the nigiri pieces they gave me since they tried to douse it in whatever awful spice-ridden concoction to mask the truly disgusting taste of the fish underneath.  I was truly offended that these people would even serve this and try to pass it off as edible food. I honestly should have notified the health department immediately.  Needless to say, avoid this place if you have any respect for yourself.",

Everything from the pho to their custom rice bowls are delicious and very reasonable. The environment is really neat and wait staff is generally very welcoming. Two of my favorite dishes are the grilled chicken pho and the exit wound bowl (which is very spicy, seriously.)  The reason for the 4-Star review is sometimes the wait can be rather slow. Some food items seem to take much longer than others and leaves you waiting, in addition the wait staff can be a bit slow to respond to checks, drinks and other side requests.",

I was there for dinner and we were sat in a semi full restaurant at the back table by the bathroom. When our female server showed up and we asked if we could be moved she seemed irritated and said \"sure\" and walked away. We had to grab our own menus and go ask another server to be relocated. Food was fantastic As always but our new server never cleared our plates and so we kept moving them to the table next to us. When she brought our check we had plates stacked on both tables.  My opinion is that the younger generation providing the service have never really paid or gone out for dinners that they are paying for themselves and are clueless on etiquette, timing and customer service.  They need basic 101 training.  The \"riblets on the menu are amazing!! If you do go, the menu is very entertaining so be sure to take a good read of it!!",

    "text": "Recently discovered by the Canadians, Moto roughly translated means \"don't eat sushi here, but everything else on the menu is great!\"  My first visit to Moto was several years ago when I had some sushi and sashimi items. My most vivid memory was ordering a Philadelphia roll and watching the sushi guy take an already made roll off the counter and cut it into pieces and serve it to me. I'm sorry, has that been there long?   Flash forward to a month ago when my parents were at Matsuri and wanted a \"Japanese\" meal. I recommended Moto because it was the only place I thought would be open at 2PM on a Saturday. I was drawn to revisit it because they offer some interesting beer selections on draught. Well, they do, and it exposed me to a couple of interesting beers I'd not heard of. My folks wanted to order sushi, so I let them, and sure enough the rolls they ordered, as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good. Everyone at the table ordered entrees and we were all very happy. The build your own noodle bowls are great. I have been back a couple times since and really enjoy it every time.   The service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip, but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be. Try getting a twenty something girl to show you any respect at Stingray, RA, etc. Ain't gonna happen, friend. I'm also impressed that they offer a great happy hour, especially Sunday when it is all day long.   Yep, Moto is a great place, as long as you don't order the sushi. The menu items are too good to pass up to order something that is sub-par or average.",

I also ordered the tuna tataki that just wasn't seasoned as well as other places but overall enjoyable. The chicken katsu is very tasty, panko breading makes anything good though, and comes with asian slaw that isn't overly tart  and the brown rice was cooked well. My son loves those desert rolls, the little fatty!   I've ordered by phone and gone in to order and either way the staff has been friendly and helpful.

    "text": "Started coming here about a year ago for the saturday all you can eat days. For the price it can't be beat. I have been here at least 15 times now and the fish is almost always fresh and good, a few times i have had a bad piece but even the best places I have been get a bad one once in awhile. The selection isn't the largest on the all you can eat but the basics are all covered with tuna, yellowtail, unagi, las vegas rolls, spicy tuna, philly, boston, alaska and spicy yellowtail all being on the list. The dessert they have the mojos are of a kind and different all the tie but never a disappointment if you have room after all the sushi.  They also have a full bar and often feature different specialty brews here as well. You can also add a sake bomber to your all you can eat for i think $4 so not a bad deal.  The gripes here is that the service is not the best as the waitresses know that they add 20% tip to all of the all you can eat bills s they don't seem to try to hard. it can take awhile to get a drink refilled (unless its alcohol and an extra charge). The other thing is that it can take awhile for the sushi to get done. I have no problem with this most days as for the amount of food I and my friends orders it takes awhile to make but on occasion it can be excessive.  Despite the fact that there are other all you can eats closer to me I willingly drive the 20-30min to come here on Saturdays. For $17 this is a great deal and a good place to eat.  P.S. if you ride a motorcycle they have helmet/jacket hooks inside and allow parking on the side walk as the owner is a rider.",

I am extremely understanding and very forgiving, but when it takes over 45 minutes to bring me avocado rolls, when it really isn't busy, there is something way wrong. Like wayyyy wrong.  I had the miso soup. Didn't like it. Once I finally got the avocado rolls, they were really good, but I was so annoyed that I could barely enjoy them. I also had to ask several times to get my tea refilled.  The location is good, my sushi was good and reasonably priced, and the decor is pretty cool, so I am going to give them three stars, but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient.",

    "text": "I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries.   I use the term \"competently\" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment.   My one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise.   I wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times.",

It's got a hip, yet laid back atmosphere, good rock music playing, and very genuine and friendly staff.    Food - I've had sushi here a few times, and it was \"good\".  About 7.5/10 on my sushi scale.  But let's talk about their build to order rice bowls.  You can mix and match a myriad of meats and vegetables and choose your temperature level.  I told my server a few visits ago that I really like hot, spicy food, and she recommended the \"Exit Wound\" bowl.  The name alone is super cool.  This selection immediately became my favorite lunch dish that I've had in ages.  Quite spicy, but not over the top....and amazing flavor sauteed into the breaded shrimp, chicken and fresh vegetables, all over white or brown rice.  (brown for me)  Did I mention that the owner of this place is a beer snob?  There are always several outstanding craft brews on tap here - and they go SO well with some of the spicier dishes.  I would come to MOTO just for the beer selections, but the food is also good enough to get me back in there as well.  I now visit Moto at least once a week for lunch, and they haven't let me down yet.  Love this joint - 5 stars - and get the Exit Wound bowl!!",

There were good, but not my thing. I ordered the Sasquatch roll that had crab, shrimp tempura, scallop, avocado and this orange mayo, that was KILLER! ($12.95). Wifey got the Las Vegas Roll ($9.95) that had crab, cream cheese and shrimp and it was fried. Again, a great roll. I also ordered the spicy ribs. They were sauceless and SUPER crispy!!! I was expecting more grilled ribs (like my fave at Sochu House) but there were VERY good. And as a bonus, the server brought my wife and I a shot (I had both because she was driving) because she noticed my 5 year old kinda being a hand full and thought we could use it to unwind!

    "text": "This place caught my eye because of it's fun, trendy atmosphere vibe and the sassy menu (check it out online - you'll see what I mean) made me think this place was worth trying. What better time to try it then on a fun date night with the fiance?  Well, it's definitely got the fun, trendy atmosphere and yep, the menu is still amusingly sassy and clever. As for the food, well...the sushi is....decent. I believe another earlier yelper described it perfectly as \"passable.\" Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad in any way it just wasn't as good as other sushi I've had. My fiance and I ordered three rolls between the two of us and we felt that it was mostly rice, not enough fish and not enough flavor. The spicy tuna was just not spicy enough for me - not enough sriracha in my opinion - but that's just me. Overall, our stomachs left Moto Sushi satisfied from hunger but not overly excited about anything else.   Plus, I have to share that I had my most strange sushi restaurant experience while at Moto when the couple on a date at the table next to ours loudly proclaimed that they hate seafood and proceeded to order buffalo chicken wings - which they then ate with chopsticks - just baffled me.  It must be the combination of the sushi and the customers but I just didn't feel like I was in the right place for a great Japanese dinner. It almost felt like it was a restaurant that just happened to serve sushi but everything else about the place doesn't match. It just felt....off. It may be worth going back just to see what else is on their clever, sassy menu but only if we happen to be in the area.",

She goes above and beyond to make sure that you have everything you need, and she is so upbeat and sweet that even if your day hasn't been going that well, you feel better!

We walked in, said we had reservations, they were empty - and sat us at a four top high table - fine!  Perfect.  After that - we sat for 15 min before we got a drink order, 15 more minutes before the drinks came along with the edamamee, and then we waited an additional hour and 15 min before we ever got our food of which we had to ask for on two occasions.  The female server kept apologizing but blaming it on the cooks and that they never saw the order she put in.  The wonton soup was cold, bland and not worth eating.  I also ordered the wok shrimp with sesame sauce but it was served with teriyaki and the shrimp was obviously pre-frozen, and hard.  Horrible.  I shared as much with her and not once did she say, I'm sorry, or let me take that off the bill.  I'm in the hospitality, resort F&B industry and have been for 30+ years and because we were with company (who shared my views) I remained silent to mgt.",

Anyway, the rolls were scrumptious, and the Las Vegas roll was a delicious departure from the norm. We started big, ordering 3 rolls each, then 3 more I think. Order what you can eat, OK? Don't be wasteful. You'll see the rules on the placard. *** $4 auto-tip added for all you can eat per person. ***   Another time I came here for my friend's b-day and the girlfriend treated several of us with URGING to consume. We all ordered a variety of rolls and we all shared many pieces of each. I felt guilty, but I couldn't get enough of the smoked salmon sashimi at $9.99 each. The presentation was beautiful - it was made to look like a rose on the plate.  The flavor and texture made me fall in love with each mouthful.  I had flashbacks of kissing Reanna, my old GF in the 90's. HHMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm.  *snaps awake* Oh and good beers too! Service was courteous and attentive.",

I generally get one of their bowls, a sushi spread or the always awesome Moto Chicken Salad.  The atmosphere is great at the bar with friendly staff, multiple TV's to give you something to watch during lunch, and a well done happy hour menu.  If you want to sit down they offer tables for all size parties and booths to sink into.    What I like about Moto is that is a stand alone restaurant with a great menu, great staff, well thought out bar, simple yet keen beer selection in a friendly casual dining environment.  I never feel over or under dressed and I don't feel like they are tying too hard to stand out.  They let their menu, staff and great environment do that for them and it makes a great atmosphere.  I have never left Moto feeling let down or charged too much.  Everything is well balanced and I really appreciate that.  I definitely recommend Moto for anyone looking for a great casual sushi place that offers really great sushi, drinks and other menu items at a reasonable price.  A++",

The artwork is stuning tho - all kinds of zoomy body art and piercings on most of the staff.  There must be a good tatoo shop nearby.  Since it is in my neighborhood I come back every few months in the hopes it has improved.  It hasn't.",

I wanted to substitute the spicy tuna roll for something else (even another 1/2 Kalifornia roll that already comes with it), but they wouldn't let me.  That was a big let down.  Other than that, my fiance ordered the pad thai, which he liked, but it wasn't the best ever.  The best thing about Moto was the sushi ice cream, called mojos.  They are delicious!  A small order came with 6 pieces, I think, and that was too much for us.  It was a good deal for the money. I would highly suggest ordering it if you have room in your tummy (which is why I only ordered the Vegas roll).  The patrons seemed to be mostly in their 20s and 30s.  I think that's a good sign.  I'm giving Moto three stars because of their lack of substitution options and their high prices for sushi.  Their rice bowls seem like a good deal, though.",

It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.  The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.

The ironic part of Moto for me, I absolutely LOVE sushi but I order other items on the menu here because they are so freakin' tasty. Two of my favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad (cabbage, chicken, peanuts, celery, green onion tossed in a light sesame vinagrette) and comes in 2 sizes - regular and large. The large is huge - fyi!  The chicken teriyaki bowl is so \"clean\" - excellent pieces of all-white meat, no chewy surprises... with your choice of white or brown rice. I like the brown rice. The sauce is a sweeter version of teriyaki, but great consistency. Avoid the miso soup - just one salty mess.   Randomly tried their dessert, called \"Mojos\" - and they really brought out the \"fat kid\" in me!!! These rolls consist of Nutella, brownie and ice-cream rolled out with a layer of rice krispie treat and then sliced. Gotta atleast try them once!   Great little neighborhood joint.

When I show up at 4:30 I'm still on my workday and use my computer and headset on my phone and take a table away from others.  This was the first time I found the service less than. Was told by waitress I was rude because I was on the phone. And when I asked for water I was brought a bill.  The busboy then started to clear the table with wine still in my glass before I even got up.  I think I'll be finding a new place to go to after our meetings and will find a new place for our members to have a quick impromptu meetings. #BadService #BadVibe #FoodWasNeverGreat  This is the first bad review I have ever left, check my others.",

The food was always good but the service was nothing to brag about.    We no longer come to this side of town, so never returned.  However, we found ourselves unexpectedly here and the service once again fell short.    I asked for no ranch on my dinner, it took three attempts to get it right.  Our server disappeared for at least 15 minutes while I sat with an empty beer and watched my wife eat her dinner.  My wife finished and I still had no plate.  At this point, I'm ready to leave.  I approached the hostess to find out what happened to our server.  Guess what, my food all of the sudden showed up.  I asked for the manager, our server said no problem.  The manager did not show up but our server came back offering 5% off the bill.  I just found it offensive.  Just acknowledge instead of pretending someone shouldn't be unhappy.  I go out to dinner for an experience, not annoyance.    It's been my experience that this restaurant is never packed, just every other table.  Just an average experience where you have to voice dissatisfaction if you have it because it's not presumed when it's a gross shortfall.  Most people hate complaining, why make them.  I wished I never said anything and just moved on.  McDonalds was just across the street.    It's not the first time an order has been screwed up, eat out enough it's gonna happen.  Generally not a big deal, crap happens, there's just better ways to handle it.  Like \"I'm sorry.\"",

    "text": "This is a great little Asian fusion joint! One side of the menu is primarily sushi the other fusion (Chinese, Vietnamese,  Thai ) The lemon grass pork was perfect balance of sweet, citus, and spice with nice cuts of pork. Sweet potato fries had just enough crunch and salt to make for a party in my mouth. Seaweed salad was generous and delightfully crunchy and not over sweet. They also happened to have a German NA beer I'd never seen before that was quite delicious.  They have plenty of alcohol,  but not being a drinker I couldn't tell you anything about it! One of my favorite parts of this place is the music...a great mix of rocking grooves from 60s-80s, but without being the repetitive \"greatest hits\" you hear over and over on classic rock stations...and kind of an old timey diner feel...on an end note, my niece is not an adventurous eater and she loves this place. When we were there last her food came with a garnish she's allergic to and they fixed it up without a fuss. After I asked about gf they were very consciousness about informing me of how various dishes were prepared. ***update : I went here a number of times while I was in phx and there was a steady decline from my initial awesome experience.  Food quality was pretty steady with the exception of some soggy, doused in sugar sweet potato fries. Service was very poor by the end...one time i didn't receive all of my change, one another continuously forgotten items throughout the meal, including bringing the appetizer at the end of the meal...when asked to take it off the tab since it was covered in the sauce we asked to not have since it was an allergen, they declined but brought us a freshly made one...I guess we can be grateful they didn't just scrape off the death-on-a-plate and bring it back.",

Teriyaki and curry are my favorite options. They have good salads and one of my favorite things is their version of a shrimp tacos. Yummy!

After ordering, the waitress completely ignored us, until we started asking about our food after 50 minutes of waiting.  She kept telling us one more minute... for 20 minutes.  Before our food arrived, we asked for the bill to cancel our order.  She talked us into staying and we did because of our loyalty to this place.  Eventually the food came with a hair in the sushi that we tried to ignore.  After receiving and paying the full price for our food, we asked to speak to a manager.  We were told things were busy and that they hope they see us again.  So in summary it has good food if you're willing to wait forever in a moderately full restaurant to get served.",

Nothing spectacular, but good.  The fish has been better than some places.  And the AYCE sushi special on Saturdays for $15.95 is a great deal.  Today I went to lunch with a PG girlfriend, so, no raw fish for her.  We decided to share two dishes, the sweet & sour shrimp and the veggie pad thai.  While the serving of pad thai was huge, I thought that $8.95 for no meat was a little steep, it's $12.95 to add chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu.  And the shrimp bowl was good, the sauce was tasty and not too sweet, but only 5 pieces of shrimp.  Not a value.  Since they don't have a lunch menu, I think I'll stick to Moto for happy hour and for dinner and AYCE on Saturdays.",

The server who was facing me less than two feet away putting something into the computer never made eye contact or acknowledged me. She was able to chat with coworkers about how horribly busy she was. Here's a tip - if you continue to ignore customers and complain in front of them about how overwhelmed you are (of course, it's all about you), you won't have to worry about customers. They will stop showing up. After standing there listening to the employees chat among themselves for several minutes, I asked if someone could handle takeout. Finally someone decided to help me, but I shouldn't have had to ask. Does anyone care about customers, or is everyone completely self-centered?",

We haven't had that much food for that low of a price in a long time. I don't think anywhere else serves such generous portions of sashimi, and definitely not at that price.  We will definitely make this a regular place to visit.",

    "text": "I've had better sushi elsewhere.  The service is what is worst.  When I've ordered, it's usually over lunch and I don't have time to dine in so I order ahead and pick up.  I've done this three times.  Don't ask me why, I guess I just like giving people lots of chances or something, unless they royally screw up the first time.  Each time I've gone in, I have to wait at the register and am completely ignored by EVERYONE who works there, even though they are standing right in front of me.  I'm not a picky or overbearing person who is prone to exagerration either.  I've waited tables before, I know you should at least greet someone and tell them you'll be right with them no matter how swamped you are.  Each time, they always forget the sauce that goes with one of the sushi rolls, and when I ask them (because I know they forgot), they act annoyed, check the bag- lo and behold, it's not there and they have to put it in.  Anyway, if the service were better I'd give it a better rating.  The sushi is just okay.  Maybe their other stuff is better.  The service bites.  Did I happen to mention the service could use some improvement?  ;)",

None of that holds a saki bomb to the dessert.  Now don't get me wrong i don't really like desert often, but when someone comes up with an idea of a \"sushi roll\" dessert that contains, nuget, ice cream, rice crispy treats, chocolate sauce i am interested.  when they serve it in a bowl cut like sushi and looking like sushi i am SOLD!  do yourself a favor go to happy hour and get the dessert role.",

    "text": "I woke up wanting both Mexican and sushi, so what's a girl to do but go to Moto! I remembered their Asian nachos and before stepping foot out of bed visions of them were dancing in my head! I was kind of worried bc I know saturdays they have the all u can eat sushi thing and I've heard it gets packed and service is slow, but the nachos on my brain were too hard to ignore so we pressed on!  It was near-full, but we were seated and had a small chicken nachos in no time! So flippin good I can't even tell you! The sauce is like half BBQ half hot sauce, and it's fantastic! We got an extra side of that and of sriracha (bc sauce, to me, is a must-have).  We decided to go with the a.y.c.e. deal, and I ordered 4 rolls and 2 kinds of nigiri. Our server then turned to my companion and asked what he would like?!?!?!? Huh? I'm not a competitive eater! I had ordered for both of us. She got all bristly, and I told her we knew that each person pays 18.95 for ayce, and we were cool with that, but just ordering together. It was a big deal that needn't be, but whatev's.   I'm not a fan of smoked salmon, but the Vegas roll was still good. Fry anything and it works. The tootsie was our favorite and the spicy yellowtail our least. We couldn't finish our order and didn't order anything else. Our server said she felt bad for charging us both the ayce price when we only ordered one plate, but she had no problem doing it. They must have a lot of losers coming in trying to feed the whole fam at one price I guess. Not so cool for us normal people. I will be back for those damn nachos, but probably won't ever do the ayce again. If you can pack it away-go for it, if not-just stick with what you like and avoid the drama.",

I asked our server about a wine on the menu and she said it was new.  My friend asked if she could bring a taste, and her answer was \"i don't think so.  It comes in a bottle\".  We said - we only want a glass and she repeated the same thing. ( Is that as opposed to a box?)   I just ordered it anyway and low and behold it was not very good.   We then ordered our food.  My two friends ordered sushi.  They were just starting to eat when a server came by and asked for the soy sauce.  My friends asked if she was going to replace it, and she said no - she needed to clean it for the night.  She forced my friends to load up on the soy sauce so she could take it.  The rest of the night the staff proceeded to hound us and ask us if they could take our plates - even when we were still eating.  This was not much past 9.  I know we were running a bit late, but there were still other people in the restaurant.  And finally, we were sitting outside and one of the staff members came out and loudly cleared his sinuses and spit on ground near us.  It was just gross.  Food is good - not great.  Definitely not worth the terrible service.",

I have not tried everything on the menu but one thing that is good is the Curry Soup. It is very spicy and has a great flavor. It is just not very filling, more or less soup with about a 1/2 cup of rice and a bit of crab meat. A bit pricey at $5.75. All the portions are very small and over priced. Come here for the drinks, to eat a bit, and hang out with friends but not if you are looking for great food.",

She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment.",

    "text": "I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place.   I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she \"needs a minute to move the table\" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit.   Star removal #1.  We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?  Star removal #2.  We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow.   Star removal #3.  They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.  Star Removal #4  I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that \"We can grat anyone we want\" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.  Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.  P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours.   FAIL.",

Not only did they not want to give me any discount, but when the manager came over I was told $3 was all she could do. I don't understand why she thought that was okay for a $40 bill.

I asked to pick up my food in 1 hour, they asked why I was calling so far in advance... I explained that I was going to be in a meeting and couldn't call back in 30 minutes to place the order.  Their response was that they would have it ready in 20 minutes, but I didn't want my sushi sitting for another 40 minutes before I picked it up.  They said they couldn't guarantee to have it ready in an hour.  SERIOUSLY?  You're kidding, right?  So, I hung up and won't be doing that again.

The concept is fun and whimsical like a Japanese girl taking pictures and making a peace sign, but it's all make-up no substance. The rolls are weak and I would not recommend the yakisoba.   If you're a typical Phoenician, this is a great starter place for the non-adventurous types that fein at being adventurous. There is nothing weird on the menu and almost all of it tastes like chicken!",

The dedication to an atmosphere that stays hip, knows its customers, and evolves to capture your heart and palette remains the core of this perennial hit year after year.    From the great happyhour, to the ribs on sundays, to the new addition of vietnamese cusine there is nothing on the menu that isn't ready to bring a smile to your face.  Every time my friends can't decide where to go, I respond, Moto!  Everyone finds a dish or sushi roll that fits their mood and a brew that compliments the moment.  That alone gets them 4 stars, the 5th star is reserved for having one of the best desserts in town, the Mojo....ice cream sushi.....",

But one thing we always forget is how bad the service is. If you're going to impress and take a large order from memory, you better get it right. Yet they never do! Advice, for parties of 4 or more, please do not try to remember everything by memory. The kind server forgot 4 Miso soups, 2 rolls, and our appetizer. Then as usual we waited 20 minutes for our bill to be brought while he fraternized behind the bar with his buddies. If the service is ever brought up to par, this could really be one of the better hidden gems in the area.",

When our food came out, the rolls were on the same plate (I had shrimp), so my wife apologized for the problem but let the waitress know that cross-contamination was a concern. The waitress took the rolls away, but them brought the same ones back on separate plates while assuring us that the staff had changed gloves in between making them, and that there was no way there would be an issue.  We left after being chastised by management for not explicitly stating there was an allergy problem when we placed our order (we made the mistake of being first-time customers and not knowing that things come out plated together). Apparently its not good enough to try to clarify when the food arrives. The manager told us it was our fault for not telling the waitress at the time we placed our order, and indicated that they refuse to remake rolls when there is an allergen concern.  So, we got blamed for my wife's allergic reaction, and the food wasn't even good. Even without this terrible customer service and allergy issue, we wouldn't consider going back.",

I typically get the Beef Pho, extra beef and usually a small Papa Tran Riblets appetizer. When done right both are delicious. I love these riblets, they are addictive and are coated in salt and pepper and chili flakes. They are served dry and very addictive if you like a little heat you can't eat just one!   My beef with Moto is consistency, both on food and service.  I got takeout last night and the Pho was very good but the riblets just didn't have their normal coating of seasoning and it's the heat I really like. Don't get me wrong they were still good, but just not the same.  This is not an isolated incident it's happened several times where something is just off and also more than once they have actually left a whole dish or a component out of my order forcing me to return. It didn't happen last night because I've learned to double check.   When done right these two items are both very very good. I just wish they would be done right more often as you just never know here.  That said it's convenient and I keep going back because like I said when it's good when it's good.   Mojo's their version of an ice cream sushi rolled in Rice Krispie treats. Well you will have thought you died and went to heaven.  Super delicious.  You never know what flavor you are getting.   I've never had their sushi but I've dined in and had the Pad Thai which was also good.  Three stars for inconsistency of food preparation and service for pretty regularly leaving something out of a takeout order.",

Again a yell from behind the bar wanting to know if we wanted water to drink. I ordered the panic shrimp x 2 ($4.50 each) and a wonton soup. She ordered the chicken caesar salad. The place had maybe 6 people dining and at least that many employees all congregated behind the bar. Eventually our food came. The shrimp are large shrimp that someone has beaten the hell out of until they are paper thin and then deep fried. They were warm, not hot, and very greasy. The wonton soup was almost tasteless. Watered down chicken broth (most likely from a can) and 3 soggy wontons. The wontons were unseasoned and the texture mealy. I gave up at this point and cut my losses with the disappointing appetizers. I was told the chicken caesar salad was acceptable, but nothing that you couldn't get at any other fast food joint. Overall very disappointing and we will most likely never return.",

I've been in the service industry over 10 years and I find the blatant honesty of the \"you order it to pay for it\" to be exactly what all restaurants should do. Unless there is something extremely wrong with your food item, (which there has never been at Moto for me) then eat it and stop looking for a free meal. Moto has my favorite happy hour in all of Phoenix. Constantly fantastic beer selections and the service has always been great. At times slow, but always very polite. Also, those of you reading too much into the signage out front, get a life.",

I've been to many sushi joints in my time, and can tell you that Moto sushi is a decent place for your average sushi consumer, but won't impress most others. Rolls are pretty generic, and sloppily made. Service was good, which is why it gets 2 stars. Prices are up there among better restaurants, so I suggest you look elsewhere cuz it ain't cheap. They have a happy hour menu, and also an all-you-can eat menu...if that interests you. They are the only sushi joint within a few miles, otherwise the competition would eat them up in no time. You can try it for yourself, but I'm just trying to save you a few bucks here...",

This is a good compromise when you are going with someone who isn't wild about sushi. They do only offer 4 rolls during the Happy (Kalifornia, Tootsie, Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna) but all four are fresh and delicious. We also tried the asian nachos which we both thought were amazing! They are made with friend wontons some kind of spicy cheese, chicken and avocado. (I'm sure there was more on it but we ate it so fast there wasn't time for much research.)   You can't beat the Happy hour prices!  For 2 people we had a total of 3 beers, 3 orders of sushi and a small asian nacho and it came to $24. One big improvement over last time was the service was much faster. This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays, but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else.",

We arrived at 8:50 p.m. and were seated almost immediately. In the back. Trying to review our menus in the near darkness wasn't easy. Ten minutes pass as tables around us get hovering attention. We, however, weren't even offered drinks. Just when I was calling Hana to see how late they were serving, someone finally came up to us for our drink order and appetizers. Our soup and appetizer came before our drinks. The Duece was our main course and mediocre at best. I'm used to my sushi/sashimi being a little cooler than room temp.  I echo the comments about a limited menu.  Sorry, but I wasn't impressed. That doesn't mean I won't try again...but I don't see myself waiting another 10 minutes while those around me are being serviced.",

It was a fun end of the meal treat.  Outside of that unique desert experience, their sushi was just so so.  The waitress had a \"secret menu\" that she did not even inform us until we had got our order.  My co worker then proceeded to order another roll after we found out about this secret menu.  I'm not sure what is the point of the secret menu if they don't show it to you until you after you receive your food.  What's the point?",

Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.   Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.  My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back.  *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future",

I always get a rice bowl, and the crispy tofu is delicious! I've also had the salmon, and I thought the flavor was great, but the portion was a little small. My favorite thing on the menu is the red curry crab bisque soup, which is out of this world! (I just wish they had a smaller portion that wasn't $5 because I feel like I end up buying 2 dinners).  We tried the rice krispies rolled in ice cream for dessert, and I didn't think that was all that great - it sounds better on the menu than it actually is. You won't be disappointed here.",

    "text": "Our second time here.  Be warned that Saturday afternoons are busy, they offer an all you can eat sushi deal.  We were not impressed by the sushi last time we were here, so that wasn't an objective.  Instead, we had crispy fried gyozo and tacos, both shrimp and BBQ pork.  The fried dumplings were excellent, I think they were deep-fried as they were crispy all around, I'm not sure you can do that with a skillet, and I have no problem with that.  The dipping sauce was decent but not exceptional.  The tacos were great, I loved my BBQ beef and my wife liked the shrimp.  Two tacos per plate made an excellent late lunch, very good portion size to be full but not stuffed.  I do have to take exception to their guacamole.  I fully understand that they're going for an Asian, not Mexican, vibe for their guac, but it needed seasoning.  I'm not sure what, but I found the flavor kind of flat.  My wife thought it had enough salt, it just needed something to kick up the flavor a little.  Also, the wonton chips for scooping it?  Their strength is not up to the weight of the guac.  We had the Mojo's for dessert, basically it's an ice cream sushi roll.  The ice cream flavor can vary day-to-day, today it was strawberry.  The two pieces that we got were an excellent cap to good food.  Service was not good.  We had to flag down our server for refills for our tea, for a box for the fries to take home for our poodle, for the check.  They were kinda busy, still, it's what they're paid and tipped for.  And finally, and sadly, whatever it was that I was smelling six months ago was still there.  I'm still not sure whether it's cleaning products or sushi, but it was something that really didn't sit well with my nose.  Still, we liked the food and will definitely consider them for future eats.",

I stopped by to check this place out after some christmas shopping errands, around 9:30 this Saturday.  Being a fan of sushi and craft beer, this was on my list to check out.   The waitress came by and handed me a list of beers on a folded piece of paper from her pocket.  I was really stoked with the selection.  I ordered a Dogfish Head 90min IPA.  The lovely waitress returned only to crush my hopes by saying that was an old list and that they didnt have any Dogfish Head on tap.  (Insert trombone failure sound effect here.  :::Waaahhh Wahhhhhh:::: ) Then she gave me a newer folded piece of paper with a slightly less appealing selection.  However, i found a tasty IPA and pulled the trigger.    I perused the menu... everything has \"Krab\" which must mean its artificial crab.  Most rolls also have something tempura.  This is classic tell-tale sign that they keep minimal fresh fish on hand.  Given that it is 9:30p on a saturday night and there is only one other table there, it's probably a good thing. This place doesn't get much traffic, so a lot of fish wouldn't sell fast enough.    I asked the waitress if these \"inside out rolls\" were their specialty rolls.  She said, nope, i have another secret list for that.  She slips me the folded paper list.  I'm starting to feel like i'm on a treasure hunt!  So exciting.  What other fun lists might she have up her sleeve?!  I ordered a Senorita roll because it is one of the only ones with fresh tuna on top of the roll.  The roll was large.  It wasn't cut with precision, some pieces were much larger than others, some smaller. (The place was empty, so it wasn't that the sushi chef was busy and rushed, he was just lazy.)  The Krab filling was Meh.  The tuna on top was tasty, but was certainly frozen, so it wasn't super.  Overall, the mediocrity of the roll was hidden by a lot of sweet eel sauce and some tempura crunchies.    As far as sushi places go, i'd give it a C. However, thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish... As far as suburban restaurants go, id give it a B.  If you really like sushi, go somewhere else.  If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up, then this place is perfect.  (I'll probably be back for that exact reason.)  If you've recently been on a date to Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  You will think this place is amazing.  Then again, you'll probably order a bud light too.",

I think it would be hard to seat more than 6 or 8 together.  I get the rice bows (4-step entree), which are PLENTIFUL. I ordered the larger, plate-size. It was more than 2 meals for me.  All the sauces on the 4-step entrees are really good. I can't decide which one I like best.    The (all young, all female) servers wear tank-tops, and they all have the same look/aura. That worries me that the manager is hiring based on looks, not professionalism.    The sushi is good and comes out quickly. I have not tried their all-you-can-eat, but if you do, beware: there are lots of rules posted.    The owner's wry sense of humor pervades the place (menu, website, table tents....) Sometimes it works, sometimes it degrades the atmosphere.   I mentioned to the owner once that I thought someone made a mistake with my sauce. It was too hot for me to finish my dish.  I told him I thought he should check that batch of sauce. I had eaten it other times with no problems. He giggled and told me a wild story about his plans to add an \"exit-wound level of spiciness to the menu. So hot it burns twice!\"  I wished he had taken me seriously. BTW the \"exit-wound bowl\" is now on the menu.... see what I mean about his sense of humor?",

We wanted to give this place another try because our friends loved it.   I had the Stoner Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely delicious. So a sushi place selling a buffalo chicken, lettuce, ranch and rice bowl.   Yeah, it seemed like something you would eat after a late night of drinking. Very impressed. Huge portion of chicken, just a touch of ranch and white rice that goes perfect. I will be back again. Just shows you that you should always give a place a second chance.",

They are the best wings I've ever had, and I'm one of those girls who doesn't eat wings in public, but one whiff of the Caramel garlic goodness and I inhaled half my friend's order. Love. Also, Moto sports a rockin beer lineup which is almost unheard of in a sushi joint-they have happy hour every day of the week! The sushi was good, I'm a huge fan of the bowls myself. And every single time I've been there (a dozen? More?) I've had stellar service. Super awesome staff, lovely ambience, awesome food and beer!! Go to moto, you will love it!",

Washed it all down with two glasses of Sapporo:)    The only thing i have to complain about is our server--she wasn't very nice and forgot our napkins when we asked for them a second time...but other than that good experience.    The location is easy to find--still in central phx.    Go during happy hour 4-6:15, half of selected sushi rolls and two bucks of beer.  Good appetizers as well.  Saturdays they have all you can eat sushi for 18 bucks from 11-2:30...not sure if i will do that, but never know.",

When I get the Exit Wound for takeout, it is actually one of the most economical meals I can get. The Exit Wound is very spicy, but not so much that the other flavors get hidden in that, but the best thing about this meal are all of the different textures. It is a great experience to get this, but only if you can handle the heat.",

Our last visit was about 2 weeks ago;  we ordered all 5 rolls on the happy hour menu,  wine and beer.  Service was prompt, the drinks and rolls came lickety split and all was fresh and flavorful.  Leftovers were cheerfully boxed and just as tasty for the next day's lunch.  My favorite part of Moto is that the rolls are a little skinnier than most others and therefore it's easier to eat one entire piece at a time without cutting it or biting in half.  Manageable bite sized pieces.  The dessert roll is always a hit.  We'll go back.",

The sushi is all fresh and tasty and very cheap during happy hour (10% off everything, 50% off some rolls).   I am not saying you should mention the word underground to your server but I am not saying you shouldn't either, and if you do you may be rewarded with very delicious menu options...",

It took over 5 minutes to get water on the table. We ordered a gyoza, a tootsie roll and a spicy tuna roll. It took an additional 30 mins for that to come out. Our waiter was rude and short with us, hardly came to the table at all. I didn't try the spicy tuna because I'm 9.5 months pregnant but my sister couldn't even choke it down because the fish tasted bad. We had to scarf our food down because my sister had to return to work. We didn't  anticipate it taking 40 minutes for two sushi rolls and some fried dumplings. It would have been one thing if it was busy, but it wasn't. And every time I come here the service gets worse. Seriously moto, this is the last time!",

    "text": "I've been in and out of this place for the last 2-3 years since I work so close to it and little has changed. Well,  everything except for the staff who may as well change every other week explaining a lot about the service or lack thereof.  Moto is run by both pretentious and puerile people who make the tragic mistake of thinking that they are either clever or fun. They are neither. Their menu is only half as ridiculous as their thinly veiled tantrums between employees about customers and co-workers. Well, depending on which menu you get, because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers.   No joke, any one menu you see is incomplete because you have to get their \"secret\" menus to see what they really have. Often these same menus are woefully inaccurate anyway making any one menu pretty useless overall. You may as well cross your fingers when you order. My eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head when the staff explained this fun gimmick to me.  They burn through waiting staff like the place has a revolving door, so an all-too frequent sight is a woman sobbing her eyes out just outside the building because she got fired. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the boss will be out hollering at them making it even more attractive. Yeah, I want to eat THERE; where the women cry.  For the record, these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant (Formerly a Shogun Express), peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast \"this place is condemned, but eat here anyway\" sort of look and feel.   You know what they say about eating in a low-lit environment, right? The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant, but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various \"taxes\" to punish customers.   I'm not kidding. I observed a guy who got hit with a \"Geek Tax\" for bringing in his child holding a McDonald's cup, he was less than happy for the remarkle expense for a bowl of Chicken. I asked about it later and they explained that they fine people for various reasons and sneak it onto their bills.  It's not a great place to spend time, but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway, you'll also come to embrace the ugly, uncomfortable furniture, which is meant to compel you to leave. So it's ironic that everything takes so long.  The food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety (and stupid list of in-restaurant rules) are pathetic. The management is barking mad, the servers can't juggle tables and the prices are as reliable as the unreliable menus.  If you MUST try this place, try to do the take-out service if possible. It's the only way not to be disappointed. Eat in at your own risk. I don't drink so I can't speak for their alcohol, but I hear their beer selection isn't bad.",

My rainbow roll had pieces of fish that were about 1-2mm thick.  Fourth, the service was slow. The roll came out about 15 minutes after the person I was with got her pho soup.

Not sure who they are trying to fool but it's a red flag when you serve sweet basil instead of Thai as the garnish. To make things worse their was still dirt on the basil leaves and it was dripping with water. Good service though.",

You'll notice the menu is full of \"rolls\" that are mostly cooked fish or imitation \"krab\" that's in California rolls, that's because their sushi is awful.   I've had better sushi from Safeway at a third of the price. Yup bad sushi and extra expensive.   Other things on the menu may be good but then the restaurant shouldn't have sushi in the name it should be an Asian restaurant. It's like Waffle House having awful waffles but good omelettes ...",

Ordering a roll without cucumber isn't rocket science. Their customer services is quite lacking, telling me to call back in 30 minutes when I was just trying to get my order corrected. When I did get a hold of someone, they asked me if I was sure my order was incorrect because they asked their employee if it was done correctly. I wouldn't waste my time with them if it was truly my fault. If I'm paying for premium sushi, it should be right every time. Save your money, go to Sushi-Station down the road.",

Great deals on beer, and average rolls that'll appease a craving.   The dinner experience is more deserving of 2 stars, but I rounded up. The quality of the food doesn't align with their regular prices.  We ordered Gyoza to start. The skin was soft and steamed but it was the blandest little bugger I've had, and it was slightly cold. I then ordered the Lemongrass Pork and I got really confused. It was supposed to be a noodle dish, but it was 60% iceberg lettuce, the pork was super dry as well. At least what few noodles I had were good and I liked the sauce.  Nick wasn't impressed with his dish either. Too little shrimp, not enough spice. The bartender was such a sweetheart though, and the beers were good. Oh well, sometimes a place is only meant for happy hour visits (shoulder shrug).",

My cousin ordered the Moto wings with the gas mustard sauce for an appetizer for us and if you like spicy you will like it, it is spicy, he always orders the hottest thing on the menu and always tells them to make it as hot as they can.. He also ordered The Classified bowl and didnt have to say anything about making it hot and it ended up being the hottest dish he has ever had. So good job MOTO !! .. I tried a few pieces and it had some great flavor. If you think you like spicy then try this and maybe you wont anymore.. spiciest dish in arizona. to top it off for the 5 stars was the service.

I don't drink but they have a large varitey of beers and wines. Many I have never seen or heard of to choose from. The bartendar told me the owner loves to switch the beer regulary to give different options.   If you are looking for a trendy place with a great variety of food this is the place to eat.

Well done!  It would be nice if they had 12-year Yamazaki single malt to really put the cherry on top of their Japanese theme (even Benihana has that), and that would probably double my frequency of visits, but I guess they have plenty of the ordinary mid to top shelf liquors.     4.25 star ambience/decor.  Dark and modern.  Just how I like it.   4 star sushi/sashimi:  Our party of six tried about six rolls.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done.  I found the quality to be high, but the execution and taste forgettable.  My wife would certainly disagree - she had the \"Senorita Roll\" on her mind for many days after we went there, and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.  4.25 star dishes and appetizers:  The spicy riblets are INSANE.  One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle...but it works!  And I think that is what is special about Moto...the menu has a nice dash of daring, unconventional twists on what could have been (and often is) just very ordinary fare at other places.    PS - the portion sizes of some dishes (like yakisoba) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here, so if you attend with a group, don't be afraid to \"underorder\" a bit and to share it family-style.",

I admit I mostly get the same items every time and out of the probably hundreds of times I've eaten here I've only had less than great food a couple times. They have vegetarian items too and most things can be ordered with tofu instead of chicken or beef ( the noodle bowls and Asian nachos). They also have an all you can eat sushi special on Saturdays I believe. Oh and you must try the mojos - they are a dessert item and to die for!  I order off the underground menu and it states that since they're specialty items it may take longer to make which is fine for me because I usually order to go anyway and the times I don't I order one of the craft beers on the constantly changing beer menu - I do love experimenting with the beers from different places.  There are a lot of regulars - smiling faces - and there are TVs playing the current games at the bar, very low key laid back vibe, I love it.  I will say it is much harder to get parking since Sprouts moved into the area but that's the only downside.",

Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.  During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it.  Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!",

    "text": "We have been going to Moto for quite a few years now and I just realized that I have never given them a review so it's about time I do that! I was not a sushi/sashimi fan, when we started coming here, my husband was.  With the help of the sushi chef Ivan, I have slowly come around to enjoying sushi.  He knows what I like and what I don't like and will always fix something very yummy for me.  He also makes a special bowl for my husband and almost every time, someone will ask where to find it on the menu and we just have to tell them that it's something special and they need to ask Ivan for it. All the sushi/sashimi we have had is very fresh, tasty and the portions are large.  I also get other items from the menu and they are all great as well. We usually sit in the bar area and our server is Charitye, who does a wonderful job taking care of us and everyone else in that area, while at the same time, making drinks for most of the restaurant, handling to go orders and generally anything else that comes her way, always with a big smile on her face. If you haven't been to Moto before, you should give it a try.",

There was one other couple in the dining area, plus a few guys at the bar laughing and having a good time.  Our server, Matt came over and asked about drinks.  We asked for water, a beer, and a cocktail.  Matt brought us the drinks but no water.  We then ordered edamame while we perused the menu.  Matt came back to take our dinner order.  We put it in.  At this point Matt focused all his attention on the three guys at the bar.  They were all regaling the others with tales of some movie they'd watched.  Our server was in the middle of it.  I noticed our bowl of edamame was ready for delivery.  Matt wasn't quite ready to get back to his job.  Eventually, we received it and asked again for water.  The water finally came, and I noticed the sushi chef put our orders up.  Matt was again back in the corner of the bar, yucking it up with his buddies.  A few minutes went by as our sushi grew warmer and warmer.  Eventually Matt delivered it.    The sushi was pretty good,  at its price point.  There are many, many sushi options in Phoenix.   We chose Moto because it's close to home.  In the future, we'll go elsewhere.    My wife wanted to add that she enjoyed her roll, but the table seemed \"sticky.\"",

    "text": "Eh. That is by experience of Moto sushi. Eh. I don't know where to start- because Moro sushi left me eh. More confused than satisfied.   The Menu- wtf was this? It's attempt to be funny and educational fell short and led you down a path of confusion and disorganization.. desert listed on the noodle page?? Beer list folded in the back of the book. Crap I should've taken photos.   Price- expensive really for the quality of food. I was surprised at the cost of their rolls actually all of their menu items. 6-7 dollars for miso soup? 9 dollars for a California roll ( with imitation crab) or 11 for real crab. Never have I paid 9 bucks for a Cali roll not even at more expensive, well renowned sushi places.. Cali roll  the roll left for unadventurous children learning the in and out of their pallets. 16 dollars for pho!! Pho places that make pho don't charge 16 bucks for a bowl or pho.... wait I thought we were at a sushi joint or at least Japanese.. but they had pho on the menu.   Now the food. Blah .. eh. Mediocre .. ordered the B noodles, Yaki Soba and teriyaki chicken with white rice. I do give credit here for portion- large quantities but what's the point when It's bland and mediocre. People wei ( not a fan) has better tasting noodles than moto. Flavor was up there with that chain \"Chinese\" restaurant..  the sushi wasn't anything that stood out from any other sushi place- I would think Moto would deliver something better than below average food given their prices.   They get two stars before the server was pleasant and absolutely patient as I brought with me my 6 year old and 2 year old niece and nephew that apparently are being raised by baboons with zero manners or respect for anyone. Made sure she got an extra tip. Oh and the beer is adequately priced. Aside from that this is definitely a place not to stop by.",

    "text": "Had a very brief experience at Moto 2 nights ago.  My date and I were looking for a good sushi place close to home, so we decided to try Moto.  I have celiac disease which means no gluten, but sushi is usually a good choice because sashimi is naturally gluten-free and all I need is some wasabi and gluten-free soy sauce and I'm happy.  After glancing at the menu, on the first page in big letters it says that they don't do anything in their kitchen to prevent cross contamination in their kitchen for folks with food allergies, and furthermore it said \"Gluten Free Folks:  We are not Gluten Free Folks.  End Transmission.\"  That's not only really rude to put on the front page of your menu, it demonstrates a lack of concern and caring about their customers, and more disturbing a lack of concern about the quality of their own food.  We got up and left and won't return.  Nice job Moto - we didn't let the door hit us on the way out, in case you were wondering.  Also, the prices were wayyyy too high.  For sashimi they wanted $16 for only 6 pieces!  We ended up going to Squid Ink and had a great time, got gluten free soy sauce and a platter of 20 big pieces of sashimi for only $26.  You'd have to be dumb to eat at Moto and pay their prices, when better food, prices and customer service are just a short drive away.",

I'm used to receiving somewhat tiny salads at sushi restaurants when described as a side salad. Quite impressed. Ginger dressing was great. Thoroughly enjoyed!   Scuba roll also fantastic. Rolls were large & loaded with scallops. I had to take some to go as salad & sushi more than filled me.   When I mentioned to server I would need to be going soon, I received bill timely, and was out of the restaurant quickly.   All around excellent experience. Great service & terrific food. I'll definitely be back - will friends next time. ;-)",

I'll tell you...Moto Sushi has incredible food, service, and a chill/inviting vibe. The menu is brilliantly creative with items that will please the biggest sushi fan down to the pickiest of eaters. My favorite menu items are the pad Thai with shrimp, the Asian nachos, and the Moto chicken salad (ahhh I want some now!!). They also have things like chicken wings, quesadillas, noodle dishes, create your own bowl, fried tofu, and lots of other wonderful dishes. The food travels well so it's perfect to pick up and also great for leftovers the next day.   If you dine in you'll notice the service is very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Another perk of dining in is the vast array of their specialty cocktails and small dishes available to you at happy hour (saving money...jackpot)! I haven't actually had a drink here, but they all look quite tasty, so I look forward to doing so. The prices are mid range and reasonable for the portion sizes and quality of food. Every dollar spent at Moto is totally worth it.   Whenever I want good sushi and noodles I head to Moto. They have incredible food, friendly people, and a hip and happening atmosphere. You've got to check this place out, it's the best!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with a friend today. I had remember reading about the Asian nachos on Yelp and we ordered the small, without chicken. They were so YUMMY! Definitely something I would go back for. My friend and I were both pretty hungry and we polished off the small with no problem between the two of us.   She ordered the Pad Thai Noodles and I opted for the California roll, with the real crab meat for the $1 up-charge. My friend said her dish was okay but she left a lot on her plate, though it was a huge portion. My Cali roll was pretty good, but kind of dry. I don't  think I've ever left a piece of sushi on my plate and I actually did this time around. I wasn't overly full either though so I think it just wasn't that great. It was a pretty large roll, 8 pieces, and each piece required two bites rather than the normal one piece, one bite.   Service was pretty good. Our waitress kept our glasses full but disappear when we were waiting to pay. She also charged the wrong credit card for each of our tabs but corrected it, hopefully.   Overall, I'd definitely go back for those nachos and to try something else on the menu.",

This small (ish) place was hopping on a Friday night and we were happy to have reservations for our party of eight. We arrived about a half-hour early prepared to have a drink from the bar and wait for our 6:30 reservation. The hostess was not happy about this. I'm not sure why since we spent plenty of money at the bar AND we sat outside in the late afternoon summer heat. But her displeasure continued when she sat us as well. If the first person you meet in a restaurant is not friendly and welcoming, it sets a bad tone. Our wait staff was efficient and friendly however, and all was quite tasty. We'll revisit Moto because of the food and service, certainly not from the less than welcoming vibe upon entry.",

They have decent vegan options and I must say the portions are rather large. When we wanted a basic tofu/rice/veggies bowl we started getting take out here rather then Pei Wei or other pseudo asian joints because; it's cheaper, it tastes better and for under $6 you get a large bowl that is plenty for 1.5 meals. I have never even gotten the \"plate\" size because the bowl is always so large.   I usually get the brown rice bowl with fried tofu, add veggies and the curry or chile sauce. Once in awhile I will mix it up and do noodles instead which is good as well.  It's a decent place to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat, sometimes can get busy but it's good to have places like this in the neighborhood (plus it's not a chain - bonus).",

    "text": "I just experienced this restaurant for the second time.  My first time around, the food and service were decent and the nifty sushi dessert made the overall experience pretty cool.   The second time around, it was pretty horrendous.  My boyfriend and I were driving around trying to find a place on which we could both agree.  I was craving sushi, and he's not crazy about sushi.  Ultimately, Moto came to my mind--because they have some basic sushi rolls (although no raw salmon or really much raw nigiri to speak of) along with lots of other food.   So, Moto it was.  On arrival, as we walked up, we noticed a couple of empty tables inside so we weren't too worried about having to wait.  But, when we got inside, the host basically just pointed at a table at the bar, had us sit down, and then threw two menus onto the table and walked away.   As we sat at a table in the bar area--although we wanted to eat in the actual restaurant area--my boyfriend immediately noticed that the couple sitting behind us was completely hammered.  I listened for a moment, and indeed, they were screaming.  Screaming their conversation.  And they were discussing herpes sores.  They appeared to be on a date, discussing herpes sores, and the female occasionally mentioned her DAUGHTER.    So after listening to some loud herpes convo for a few moments, my boyfriend went and asked the host if they had a different table, inside the actual restaurant portion.  We were added to a list.    About 5 minutes later, a waitress approached, and I'm 99.9% sure that she was intoxicated.  Not just slightly inebriated, either, but kind of ridiculous drunk.  She looked all glazed over as she asked if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if they had a drink menu and she stared at me like she was really confused.  Then I asked if they had a cocktail menu, and she said, no, we have a menu of beer and wine.  She gave me a weird look.  So, thinking I was mistaken about the drink situation, I asked, do you guys have a full bar?   She said, oh, yes!  What do you like!?!?  I like fruity drinks, so I asked if they had Stoli Razzberri (or however it's spelled).  She said, \"I LOVE THAT.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE.\"  Then she informed me that she wasn't sure if they had it, but she would check.  My boyfriend (who was driving) requested a water, and the waitress walked away.   Eventually after enduring more conversation about that chick's kid and various human ailments (herpes, chicken pox, the flu), the host told us they had a table for us.  He walked us to the table and threw menus on it.  As he started to walk away, I mentioned to him that I had ordered a drink from the waitress at the other table and I didn't want her to wonder where we went.  He said he'd already told her about it, and not to worry.  A few seconds later, he brought the drink over and set it down.  Oddly, the drink was pink, and a Stoli Razz & tonic isn't usually pink.  But I figured it looked interesting so I'd give it a shot anyway.    Shortly thereafter, our actual waitress approached.  She immediately started LECTURING us about how we can't just order drinks at the bar and walk away without cashing out at the bar.  She went on for a while about how we needed to go back and cash out at the bar.  We explained that we never meant to sit at the bar, and that we had just gotten our drink at our actual table, and hadn't received it at the bar.  So then she kind of backed off after saying something weird, like, \"Oh, so you just got them?  Oh, okay, then you guys aren't too worried about it then I guess.\"  Then she started telling me about the drink I'd received, which wasn't the one that I ordered--it was some other type of vodka with actual fruit in it or something.  Then she gave me a long list of all the other types of fruit vodkas that they have.  I guess that was ok, and the drink ended up being pretty decent.  But it was still just....bizarre.   Anyway, we ordered our food.  That included a shrimp tempura roll, a squid salad, a regular sized order of the asian nachos, and a buffalo burger.    The shrimp tempura roll and squid salad came out first.  I'm an idiot who's terrible with chopsticks, and I didn't notice that we had no forks until the waitress was gone.  It took a while to obtain a fork.  But anyhow, the squid salad was pretty decent, typical for any sushi restaurant.  The roll was....ok.  The crab mix in it was kind of like what you could get in a crab salad sandwich at Subway.  It also had carrots in it, which were kind of overwhelming.    Then, out came the asian nachos.  The gigantic asian nachos.  She brought us a large instead of the regular that I ordered, and of course, charged us for the large.  I considered saying something, but I figured we'd just get a lecture.  We were only able to finish a small portion of them, because the large was freaking huge.  Fortunately they were good.    Maybe we misread, but the buffalo burger was made with buffalo, not buffalo sauce.    Moto is not very good.",

Decided not to buy any more rolls since they failed the first two tester rolls.  If you cannot make a spicy tuna roll you have no business calling yourself a sushi place.  Pad Thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish.  We were going to forgive the rolls since we can be a little snooty about sushi, but shouldn't you be?  Its not like you ordered anything cheap.  After two bites into the Pad Thai I bit into a bone! Mmm...wasnt expecting that!  I spit out the bone and looked through the Pad Thai to find three bone shards in the noodles.  Wanting to bring it to the attention of the management, cause I would want to know if it were my place if bone fragements were being served by accident to my patrons, we waited 15 mins to be told that they would make us another dish.  Aftering waiting for so long, the appetite for this place was gone and we asked if they could just remove the item from the bill.  The manager said,\"Of course, sorry.\"  No big deal until we got the bill and only the additional charge for chicken was removed from the bill.  Asking to speak to the manager again since we were told the entree was going to be removed we were told, \"I took the chicken off since that is what you had a problem with and everyone know that is the risk you take when eating chicken, cuz chicken's have bones.\" WHAT?! I was dumbfounded, not only bad food, bad service from management (server was great!) but we were actually insulted!  Wow, interesting business ethics.  No mo Moto fo sho!",

There seemed to be some confusion as to who our waitress was, and we had like 3 different ones try to take our beverage order, but eventually they sorted it out.  The Curry Soup was divine!  Red curry, coconut, a bit of heat combined with the sweet crab and rice made this the perfect soup in my book!  The potstickers were nice and crispy, and the food came out pretty quickly.  My friend got a basic sushi roll (California) and said it was good too.  I do want to come back and try the sushi, especially the dessert sushi, which looked really yummy. The inside decor is modern, clean and comfortable, making for a nice dining atmosphere.  I would have given them 4 stars but they don't have a lunch menu, and it is kinda on the pricey side when considering lunch.  Most sushi places offer lunch bento boxes, but not Moto, and I really think they should jump on that bandwagon!",

    "text": "Moto is where I really got hooked on sushi, though what I have had off of the rest of the menu is always yummy too. The sushi is always fresh and the sweet potato fries are a great side to share with the table. I recommend Moto Happy Hour to friends all the time for sushi on a budget - the California, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls are all half-price and you can grab a 20oz beer for $3.50 to wash it all down. The \"underground menu\" is also a great option when your feeling flush - the rolls are all $12 each. My favorites are the volcano roll when I want something spicy and the mayflower roll when I want something bright and fresh. YUM!  My only complaint (besides the Fox news that is always on the television sets) is that they don't usually have the Ace Pear cider on tap like they used to... my non-beer drinking friends always appreciated the option and it was a favorite of mine as well.  UPDATE: the underground menu is above ground now - printed and pricey! The happy hour is still worthwhile and the beer list always has decent craft options (although they still lack a consistent cider for those who enjoy it and tend towards primarily hoppy beer choices). We still love the place and as we prepared to move cross-country, it was one of the few spots my husband needed to visit before saying goodbye for a year.",

    "text": "So I have to say, when my friends tried to get me to try and all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, I wasn't thrilled, but it's awesome!  Moto is a small restaurant in central Phoenix (16th St and Glendale) that offers all-you-can-eat Sushi on Saturday from 11:30am-2:20pm.  And I must say, it's not just California Rolls, the special features some of my favorites; philly, las vegas, tootsy, eel, and much more.  The special is about $17 bucks, which you easily pay for two specialty rolls.  The rules to teh special are cute too, so don't over order because you'll pay 50 cents for each piece left. :-)  Also, make sure you try to Mojo, which is a dessert sushi roll.  It's ice cream (flavor chanegs everyday but we were lucky to get caramel) wrapped lie a sushi roll, but the rice is rice crispy!  Definitely a place to try if you love sushi like I do!",

My lunchmate had the Vegas roll which was good but not the best in town by a long shot (think Hana and Dozo)  The dislikes:  I ordered the katsu...   This is a sticking point with me as few or no restaurants in the US seem to serve this properly.  The Katsu was goos but tasted like a generic chicken cutlet.  Panko should be VERY crispy and tasty this was not.  The appropriate accompniament is always white rise (check!) and shredded cabbage.  There seems to be the temptation to eliminate or modify this in the US.  Bad Idea!  While the \"Asian Slaw\" is tasty  it dominates the plate in a not so good way.  The Tea - Dammit! why do place have to serve such crappy tea!  It is an inexpensive way to complement a meal.  We got an ancient teabag with genmaicha in it served uncermonioously  The Service - Come her with lots of time the service was inattentive and sporadic.  When she was there it was great it was the 20 minute absence that killed the deal  I will go back for the AYCE buffet and try the sushi...",

    "text": "*** Edited on April 13, 2008 to add this new bad experience. I'm thinking about changing my rating to ONE STAR because the experience.  Went to Moto at 9:35 PM on Sat April 13 April night. Sign states they close at 10 PM. Waitress and Host made us stand in doorway like dicks while they \"decide\" if they are still \"open.\"   They hem and haw and \"say hold on.\" I asked what time they stop seating and they said \"10:00 PM.\" I ask them what time it is. Instead of answering me directly, the waitress says \"fine, we'll seat you.\" We start to walk to the table and she adds \"but you have to order fast.\"  FUCK THAT!  So I tell her, \"thanks but no thank you\" and leave.  That was Saturday night.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start backwards, at the end of my experience. The dessert is fricking awesome! The rice crispy sushi roll ice cream thing is out of this world. Holy goodness it's yummy.  They also offer a nice selection of beer and the drink menu is diverse. The sake selection is not so great, but they do offer fun mixed drinks to make up for it.  As for the food - I would give it a B+. Maybe A-. The Asian nachos app. was actually pretty interesting (in a good way). The sushi was pretty good too. Not the best, but good.   Our server was a little strange. We couldn't decide if she was a little rude or just ditzy. But the host/door guy was great so at least we know they are capable of decent service.  Moto is a pretty solid place. I kind of wish it were downtown Phoenix rather than so far up north, but I guess a girl can't have everything she wants, right?  I'll be back to Moto soon, for sure. but the service needs much improvment.",

I was very skeptical at first, because it's dicey in Phoenix when it comes to getting good fresh Sushi. Ordered the eda mame and spring rolls for appetizers, both were great!! The plum sauce for the spring rolls was delicious. Ordered alaska roll and rainbow roll, and I was not disappointed at all. The place itself was very busy when we arrived, however the service was timely and on point. I would recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phoenix for sushi. Prices are not bad either, and by the looks of the Happy Hour menu very good prices to get your sushi on. I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could.",

As soon as we sat down the server came over and said since it was 830 there were certain rolls we couldn't order. We told her what we wanted since we already knew and she agreed that we could order those rolls. As we were waiting they started putting up the chairs on the tables around us. Then she walked out with our sushi that looked very sloppily put together and also put our check down at the same time. At this point we felt extremely rushed and annoyed. I wish when we walked in she would have said they were closing, then we wouldn't have even bothered. So, we got mediocre sushi and were rushed out. We both felt annoyed about the entire experience.  Usually its pretty decent, I would say excellent or good, just decent and this time it wasn't even that. Might be a while before we give it another chance.",

Unless the owners hire or train the waitresses better, we won't be back or refer this restaurant again.

    "text": "I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the horrible service I had on Saturday.    My bf and I decided to have a date day filled with sushi and a movie.  We arrived at Moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar.  The restaurant wasn't packed at all and we seemed to arrive at just the right time.  Our server, Lilia didn't great us for nearly 5 minutes then she took almost 10 minutes to bring us our iced teas.  She took our order of the all you can eat sushi and it wasn't too long before our sushi came out.  She never once came back in the middle of our meal to see how the sushi was and showed up as I was consuming my last piece of sushi.  Normally, the servers will come back a few minutes after dropping off the first round of sushi and from there they will take your next order to make sure you get prompt service.  Just as I was eating my last piece of sushi she showed up and took our second order.  Our ice teas were low and she never offered to refill them.  We were watching the time and noticed our movie was starting within 40 minutes so we were a little concerned.  After sitting there for 20 minutes after putting in our second order, we asked the bartender if we had an order waiting for us.  He informed us she put it in but it wasn't up yet.  Lilia was literally wondering around aimlessly and didn't look that busy so we were a little upset that she was giving us horrible service.  She finally decided to come over and give us an ETA of when our last order would be up and we asked for our bill so we could pay and leave after we ate.  We let her know we still wanted our last order but we were just trying to make a movie.  She grabbed us our bill then came back and took our plates and cleaned off the table.  We were absolutely confused and asked the bartender about our order.  He told us that she cancelled our last sushi order and we informed the bartender that we didn't tell her to do that.  At this point we were fuming mad and just ready to leave because I knew if I had spoken to the manager I would've blown up.  On top of that we missed our movie and just decided to go home.  We spent $49.70 on sushi and that included a 20% gratuity tip that they automatically put on for the all you can eat sushi.  She honestly wasn't worth the $8.28 tip that I was forced to pay.  I seriously feel like I've been ripped off and the server received a 20% tip for pretty much doing nothing.  I come here all the time and I've never had bad service like this before.  The girls are normally attentive and want to turn their tables so they make more money, which makes sense.  This was the second time Lilia was our server and both times we had horrible service.  The first time we let slide because it was a Friday night and they were doing their local brews so they were slammed.  I just thought she was overwhelmed the first time and I didn't let it bother me.  But to have poor service from the same girl twice in a row is unacceptable.    Overall, the food was excellent, the bartender was more attentive to us than our server, I just wish I could've enjoyed more.",

Appetizer is not out and we see servers walking around and it took a while for one to notice us. She came over asked if we were doing okay. We told her honestly no. And she immediately took action and did what a good server would do. She showed concern and wanted to fix it. The only good customer service was shown by the hostess Kaylie and the server Charity. Charity managed to comp our meal. We really appreciate their work and honestly the rest of the staff needs to look to them as examples of good customer service. I will be possibly coming back but next time i guess we just have to accept the fact we'll be playing the waiting game. Still good food though. They got that going for them.",

We used to live not far from this place and so had been there twice before both times the service was painfully slow and the food was mediocre at best. But some time has passed and people kept writing good reviews so we thought \"hey why not give them another chance?\" the answer is simply, \"because they scuk.\"  Years have passed yet the service is still the worst of any restaurant I have been to in the last 5 years. The waiters pretty much ignore you once you are seated. And once they take your order? Forget about it. Refill on a drink? Forget about it. Don't like how the food tastes? Forget about it. I have only had equally bad sushi at Albertson's. Both the presentation and the flavor seriously left something to be desired. If you're even considering this place for happy hour, let alone dinner ignore the bad reviews at your own risk. I have three words for you- forget about it.",

I live 15 minutes from the ocean now and haven't been impressed yet with any other business as far as service, price and quality goes. Together my friend and I ordered Tootsie Roll x2, Alaska Roll x2, Vegas roll and Veggie roll and all were VERY good.   Our waitress was very attentive and cheery, she even let us take home our leftovers (we over-ordered by an entire roll, didn't realize how stuffed we would get!) which is usually not allowed during AYCE, so thanks for that!  The initial wait time was about 20-25 minutes, but it was worth it and the orders after were very quick. I also want to note that they serve a delicious grapefruit-flavored beer called Pink Killer, which was very complimentary to our sushi rolls. When we asked where we may be able to find it outside of Moto, the waitress asked the manager who actually came out to our table to tell us about it. Very appreciated!",

I used to go about once a week.  They have since raised the price of happy hour sushi by $2, less appetizer and beer options are available.   The asian nachos seem alright for a minute, but they quickly become impossible to eat.  It's just not a good idea.  The sweet potato fries are weak.  A while back, I had a noodle dish and the vegetable Pho.  They were both overly sweetened.  After that, and the change to happy hour, I wasn't planning on going back.  I went back for the vegetable/tofu Pho, and because I asked about other vegan items they informed me the TOFU PHO now CONTAINS BEEF BROTH!!!  This is absurd.  I know beef broth is traditional, but this \"Fusion\" restaurant should at least try to have some dishes for vegans, and vegetarians for that matter.  Wow, i'm speechless.  The service is sub-par, and the menu is littered with snobby comments and jokes that belittle the customer.  All forgivable with a solid happy hour and a soup for vegans.  Bye Bye Moto.",

I ordered the \"Senorita\" off that menu and have been going back for it ever since. Of course their happy hour is RIDICULOUS, so cheap and really good!! I feel sorry for the waitresses because of all the horrible customers they must get that don't know how to tip at happy hour (in case you don't know its always tip what the meal would have been before the discount). But if they have bad customers I wouldn't know, I always get the best service!!  Awesome, yummy, and healthy! Now go have some Sushi;)",

Ordered the chicken bowl (which I always get) with brown rice, teriyaki sauce (orange NOT spicy) with vegis.  Also ordered the crab puffs, hadn't had them here before and I was extra hungry!  The crab puffs were burnt on the edges, all of them!  Had to crack off all the burnt sides and was left with the soggy middle.  How to you burn the edges and undercook the middle?  The crab part was lack luster.  The aioli side sauce that is served with these, well lets say I had high expectations and the sauce fell waaaaay short of being at all tasty, bland...bland...bland...  On to the chicken bowl.  I was surprised to see that the chicken is now served in square chunks.  Wow, someone forgot to put ANY seasoning on the chicken, again bland!!!  They also put the spicy teriyaki sauce on my meal which I did not order so my main course of the meal was ruined!    So, $16.00 later, I had about 1/3 of the appetizer that could even be consumed and threw that out and my dinner, well, the 96% full container went in the trash.  I'm not even going to risk my money on gong back for lunch.  I was truly let down.  Lack of seasoning and lack of general cooking skills in preparation coupled with the wrong sauce on the order, too many other options (Pei Wei here I come)!",

The hostess refused to seat us at the round booth because when the restaurant closes, that's where the staff \"puts their stuff.\" Made no sense considering it was 8 pm and they closed at \"about 10.\" Were seated toward back. Only three other parties in restaurant area, a couple of people at bar. The server brought us food menus. We asked for drink menus. She seemed very bothered by us and said everything was already put away for the night......again, confirmed they closed at 10 since it was only 8....10 minutes passed by and she was behind the bar doing nothing at all the whole time, still no drink menus. So we decided to leave. Clearly we were not welcome. As we walked by her on our way out, she laughed. I repeat: LAUGHED at us as she sarcastically said \"sorry.\" I am not easily bothered by this sort of ignorance but considering how often I have been here, I was very offended as well as my two friends. We all have always come here but can say never again. I feel bad for the owner because I have seen him working there himself almost every time I have gone to eat. If he only knew the type of business he is losing due to staff. It's a shame.",

    "text": "AWKWARD as attending your ex husbands wedding to your former best friend...best way to sum up tonight's dinner at Moto.  Let me start with saying, I love Moto, come often, Charity and another server, tall, dark hair, black rimmed glasses, tattoos (mad at myself I can't recall his name right now) are amazing. Know the menu, attentive and personable without being fake and obnoxious. I honestly will wait for a table in their section rather than risk not having the experience I've become custom to. Tonight...I will keep it as brief as I can. - gentleman who sat us was literally dripping in sweat. It's July, it's miserable I get it. It was not really getting my appetite going watching him drip all over our menus clearly frazzled. - the restaurant was clearly way busier than anyone expected given its summer and 7 pm on a Thursday. They were understaffed, but hey, it's summer in AZ. Things slow down.  - the ONLY people who appeared frazzled and annoyed the restaurant was busy...was the swamp monster who sat us (assuming some sort of lead / management position and a man in a purple polo. The servers and the ONLY sushi chef seemed to be on point and not showing the customers any sort of panic.  Let's talk about purple polo. It was unclear if he was a off duty Moto fun police officer. Customer who self appointed himself as the boss. Or just an unhappy man on a mission to ruin everyone's night. He spent 85% of his time sitting at the bar socializing with what appeared to be regulars, and the 15% terrorizing the staff with his overly anxious approach.  He actually felt it was necessary and appropriate to pull out server outside right in front of the CLEAR glass door for everyone to to see him, what appeared to be grilling her. Regardless if it was a slap on the wrist or a celebration of her great service. Not appropriate, and unprofessional. The restaurant was packed and she was clearly capable of handling her tables...well until he removed her to publicly humiliate her. It was unprofessional and a poor example of what I assume would be management? Save it for off hours. Oh, and maybe not chill at the bar while your understaffed restaurant busts their asses and then ridicule and undermine them in front of their customers. Normally, I would give 5 stars to Moto. My husband and I left dinner from one of our favorite places disgusted and mortified by the stranger in the purple polos' strange and unprofessional behavior. I hope he reads this review and feels ashamed and apologizes to his hard working staff.",

Moto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.    The service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy.   The bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything \"sanitary\" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.  The food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.    The ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.  Twice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s....   Please, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself.",

It's a pretty busy corner with the sprouts and Mcdonalds but parking wasn't an issue.  We were seated pretty quickly as there was no waiting for a patio seat.  Everyplace we go we will order the California roll and tootsie roll.  The California roll tasted so fresh I was actually surprised. It was very tasty and we both loved it.  The tootsie roll was also very good. The eel aside was very sweet and tasty. I had a hard time tasting the fish in the tootsie roll but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We used the low sodium soy sauce and that was rather salty the wasabi was fresh as was the ginger.  We give it 4 fish heads out of 5",

I've always received friendly service on my visits and they keep my glass full; these are a must to satisfy me. They have outdoor seating and the patio is dog friendly.  The sushi is good and they have many interesting combinations. Best of all they have spicy sushi rolls. I love the April roll and the Volcano roll.  The decor is modern. They have bar seating where you can watch the rolls made. The music is eclectic and at just the right noise level to clearly hear it, yet not have to scream to talk to the people at the other side of the table.  I've visited Moto on several occasions and will be here several more before I leave.",

The food has always been very pleasant and good. However our waitress served our table appetizers all at different times, martinis in wine glasses (?!) entrees at least 10 minutes apart, then to top it off, my cousin who was visiting me and was off duty from the military had a very bad dish.  After speaking with the general manager about a few of the frustrations throughout our meal, she did comp the food, which was very nice as we did not expect this. I would still recommend this place as it has a very casual ambiance and great dishes however I think the staff is where the fault is and if you don't mind drinking sake out of a plastic cup.",

If you wait too long for your food or to be seated they do not care nor do they apologize. If you request a substitution due to allergies etc they refuse to accommodate any requests. Even if you are willing to pay an upcharge. Additionally, their overall attitude both in person and on their website and on their menu blurbs is so sarcastic and nasty that it is blatantly rude. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this restaurant knowing how little they care about their customers and their dining experience.",

Starts out not spicy but then grows on you, by last bite my mouth is comfortably warm it was good. Now more bad, wife's Pho comes out considerably later than my food, beef in pho is a little off, maybe D grade beef? But the bowl is huge. BUT 4 pieces of beef a little bigger than an oreo cookie. Asked the server if this was the norm and she said yes in a uninterested voice. 2 good dishes, bad delivery of entrees, not exciting pho and meh service. We'll stick sushi from Moto from here on",

    "text": "Yo! I found a new awesome hidden sushi place to Yelp about!!!!  Wait, three people have already Yelped it.   And apparently it's been open for 2 years already.   Never mind.  In any case, the first time I ever noticed Moto was some weeks ago as I stepped out of Basha's - a Basha's I never go to either since I almost always take AZ-51 home after work. But somehow that day I decided to take 16th St all the way down and Moto caught my eye, although I had no idea what it was still.   Fast forward to today, another day I decide to randomly drive down 16th St.  And I hit Glendale Ave.  As I wait at the light, I think. Now, I don't think too often, but for some reason today, I did. And I thought \"There's that Moto again. What's its deal?\"  And so I pulled into the Basha's lot, parked and walked up. A nice crossed out McDonald's golden arches symbol greets you as approach the door, which kicks ass considering McDonald's is in the same parking lot.   I knew I was going to like this place already, even though I still didn't know what the hell it was. \"Go Your Own Way\" by Fleetwood Mac was blaring from the speakers. Was this a biker bar? A car-themed burger joint?  Only one way to find out.  In I went, and a cool, contemporary restaurant layout was in front of me, with a bar full of good stuff beckoning. I decided today that I was going to sit at said bar, which was the best thing I could have done - I engaged in conversation with the server and the sushi chef the entire time and got the lowdown of the place.  Moto used to be a Shogun Express once upon a time, but the owner of the chain wanted to do something a notch higher and sold all the Shoguns and turned this location into Moto. The menu is eclectic and witty, offering a variety of rice bowls and sushi, along with buffalo burgers and \"sushi ice cream\" for dessert (a great concept called Mojos, where ice cream and brownie are rolled in a layer of rice krispies and then sliced like sushi and served in a bowl). They have a generous happy hour menu and All You Can Eat Saturdays from 11am-2:30pm.   I asked them how business was going and they said it's been really good, and it has become a local hangout full of regulars in north central Phoenix, which is awesome. I appreciate that this part of town has some great places like this and not just stuck with Panda Express (or even Shogun Express for that matter).   As for the food, I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I just got unagi (eel) nigiri and an 8 piece spicy hamachi (yellowtail) roll. I'd say they were pretty well done, and although I thought Hana's sushi was better in the quality of the fish as well as presentation (he's not called Mr. Sushi Rock Star for nothing), for the price and also the taste I thought what I had here at Moto was still an awesome deal. I scored both orders plus a large Kirin Light (which came with a frosted 1.5 pint glass) for $12. Not bad. Not bad at all.  The fact that there was no pretentiousness at all here and that the servers and sushi chef were really friendly to a random confused guy dressed in his dorky office clothes, I give them high marks. Definitely another place to come back with friends (and also to partake in All You Can Eat Saturdays - you can bet your ass I'm there!).   4 stars.",

    "text": "Let's talk about the good things at Moto.  1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with \"typical\" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \"lite\" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies.   Along with the beer comes an in-frequent \"beer celebration\" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event.   2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \"to-go\" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3\" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.  I've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.  3. Desert - The \"Mojos\" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.  4. The \"Underground\" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving.   5. The \"all you can eat\" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.  And now the downside:  1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \"rice bloat\" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \"underground\" roll (mentioned above).  2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.  That's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a \"sushi experience\", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers.",

It's like having a substitute teacher in a fourth grade class when Vince isn't there.  The servers don't care and get snooty and food comes out at various times.  I think this is a result of Vince being an active owner/manager.  The problem is that he doesn't have a solid manager to back him up when he's gone.  Someone else needs to be able to crack the whip.    I'm a regular and will continue to be so, but my trips to Moto are few and far between when Vince isn't there driving his tatted-up sushi and saki slinging serving staff.",

The food portions are perfect and this is truly important to me because I've yet to meet anyone who can out-eat me. I love their custom chicken/rice bowls, sushi is always fresh, and the moto chicken wings are spicy and moist. End your meal with an order of mojos or two (I don't like to typically share my dessert unless I'm in love with you) which is dee-licious!  Oh!

Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there.  Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I can't complain. There are some \"bright\" spots. First, it's close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the \"Exit Wound Bowl\" or \"The Classified Bowl with this description;Don't Order this Bowl\".  Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique.  As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really \"hip\" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, let's face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and \"earn\" my business.",

I felt that for the price, it was a great deal. Especially coming from LA sushi prices which can be outrageous.   Travis did not read the rules and had to pay 50 cents for each piece he did not eat, which was a bummer, but I feel, it was put in the rules of the All You Can Eat deal so what are you gonna do?   The service was a bit slow, but it was clean, and the waitstaff was friendly.  I would probably go back if I wanted sushi again in Phoenix.

I started with the curry soup, quite good, with just a hint of spice. The sushi served was fresh and the portions (especially the sashimi) were quite large. My first experience at Moto? Overall excellent.  Sadly, on my second visit, I encountered a hot restaurant (eeew, raw fish and a hot environment?) with mediocre service. We arrived at 12:30 and attempted the All You Can Eat Sushi, two full hours later we had eaten exactly about two rolls and two nigiris each. minus soy sauce for the first order since we never got our soy sauce bowls. We were told the AYCES would take about 15 minutes to prepare when in actuality it took just under an hour for each order.   We watched as two different families sat at a table across from us and left after waiting for about 10 minutes to give a drink order, nobody ever came.    Finally, this little grandpa with his two grandsons came in they, like us waited and waited. the grandfather told the server he felt he had been waiting too long (45 minutes), she offered an apology and sent the manager over who began to actually argue with the man, she actually asked if he had ever eaten at a sushi place before.  Excuse me? Not professional.  Then tried to tell him that the server had placed his order only 20 minutes earlier. He was confused as he had ordered a good 40-45 minutes earlier.  The manager, again, argued with the man telling him he didn't order 45 minutes earlier.    Bottom line: AYCES is horrible, we actually overheard the manager tell the man \"The AYCES is prepared AFTER other regular orders, regardless of when placed, so that customers who order order off the regular menu get their food hot.\" Really? So the sushi chefs are also in the kitchen preparing soups and noodle dishes? Not likely.  So, take the 18 bucks, add on the automatic 20% gratuity and you've got yourself a meal a little over 20 bucks a piece and you've only eaten 5 pieces of sushi.    I will not return for AYCES, but for a dinner? Sure thing.",

IN the beginning it wasn't nearly as strict as it is now, but rightfully so they had to implement some rules(Don't be a gluten, no sharing, $0.50 per piece you have leftover that they will box up for you to take home, must eat all the rice as well...). They offer just about any kind of sushi you would want for about $18 per person, or $22 per person if you want Saki with it, still a fab deal!   My other favorite there is their chicken terriacki bowl, probably the best I have had in a long time. They have a \"built your own\" style bowl menu, very good, check it out!   Over all Moto is good, but a once in awhile venture.",

After that bowl, cool off with their ice cream sushi...it's two or sometimes three different types of ice cream (it's always a surprise and they won't tell you ahead of time what type of ice cream they are using for the night) and then rolled in rice crispies...definitely yummy.  Two chopsticks up! :)",

An AYCE sushi menu limited to Krab (yes with a K ), smoked salmon, tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and rolls that look like they're made by Sushi-bot 5000 that shoots Krab as excrement. The fish themselves are atrocious and taste like they've had better days. The Krab seems to be some kind of binding agent they try to hide in every space imaginable just to fill you up. The sushi rice is the only thing that was prepared correctly and it was a blessing in disguise for it to be served by bushels in each bite. The service is borderline senile and their \"AYCE rules\" are written very condescendingly. As we were near finished, a friend had asked if I got my moneys worth. My response...  \"yes, by not ordering anymore.\"",

Usually, even if you do find it, you have to subject yourself to annoying house beats and dress up like you're going clubbing afterwards to fit in.   Which is why Moto is such an aberration. It's sandwiched between a Blockbuster and McDonalds at 16th St. and Glendale, so the cheezy factor can pretty much be immediately ruled out.   I remember this when it was still a Shogun Express, which I also enjoyed, but I must say, I like Moto even more. They have some creative appetizers including the Asian Nachos, which are essentially nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole but instead of tortilla chips, they use fried wontons. Genius, I tell you.   Happy hour prices are more than fair and the Caterpillar and Spicy Tuna rolls are some of the best I've found. Try the all-you-can-eat deal on the weekends, too . . . Hard to beat.",

He informed them its modifying, just leave the vegetable out, one less step to making a sushi roll.  It also saves a few pennies by not adding a couple ingredients.

Maybe our waitress felt awkward since she kept forgetting? The entire time we were there it felt like we were bothering her. I could understand if they were busy why the wait was so long, only thing is.....there were six tables in the whole restaurant! They had three servers working, as well as another women who maybe was a manager? Oh, and two people cleaning tables. I work in the food service industry and know what good service is, and this was far from it. When we finally got our sushi it wasn't anything special. I wish Moto was a thousand times better, since it is so close to home, but I guess now I know why I never really went back after the last time. I just can't believe even after asking four times we never got a drink menu. I'd think our waitress would want to make money and keep us happy. Maybe they treat customers with children like they don't matter. When we asked for a highchair the guy said he didn't know if they had any, and he wasn't a hostess!! I don't know how this place stays in business.",
