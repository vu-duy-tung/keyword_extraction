    "text": "I like this place better than Uncle Sam's (heresy).  The biggest complaint here on Yelp is that it is a bit pricey, and it is compared to (say) Charlie's.  But the quality of the meat is very good.  Thin sliced rib eye, no gristle or fat, tasty.  And Uncle Sam's is about a buck and a half more expensive.  That evens out if you order mushrooms, which Sam's includes but for which Corleone's charges extra.  And I like the condiment bar.  A little garlic powder, some banana peppers, perhaps some oregano and/or parmason cheese.  Season to suit.  The price gets helped out with specials and coupons.  Your cash register receipt is usually good for $2 off your next visit.  They have specials for a six inch sandwich, fries and a drink for $5 (would be closer to $10 without the special). {Edit: that might no longer be True.]  I've not tried the pizza.  I'm not a big fan of NY style pizza, even though I lived in Manhattan.  Other's have given it thumbs up, though.",

It was awesome and I really like how thinly the beef is shaved.   Lets discuss Cheeze Whiz Fries for a moment. They are amazing, however EAT THEM QUICKLY. If Cheeze whiz is left to sit it congeals and Im not a huge fan. However if you do eat it quickly while its still all melty its one of the best things you can put in your mouth. :) Your taste buds will thank you! (Thank you Ocean Spray Commercial)  Its slightly overpriced for my liking, but when you are in the mood to treat yourself and are in the area it can be a fun place to go grab a bite, and certainly something you should try if you have not had the opportunity.",

    "text": "I have been going to Corleone's for a few months now because I wanted to try several things on the menu before I judge the place. Being a fan of Philly Steaks I thought this place would be good by the classic look of the place.   I got the tuesday night special where if you get 1 large sub for 10 bucks (without a drink of fries) you get a small one for free. It was interesting because I saw a lot of people order a large sub, and they weren't notified of the daily special. So I ordered the regular philly steak with a small hoagie.  He asked me if I wanted mushrooms or peppers on my philly steak, and i said yes, and I didint know that was an extra charge.   The Philly Steak was mediocre at best. They use low quality meat, and overcook it. The bread could be a lot better.  The guy suggested I put oil and vinger on the small hoagie I got, and I know why because it sucked! Covering it with tons of oil and vinegar is not gonna do the job if it's bad to begin with.  The only thing good here is the pizza and the fries. Stay away from everything else as it's also overpriced! $13 bucks for a philly steak combo? are you kidding me? Tell people about your specials, and stop penny pinching people for extra money. Tell me if peppers and mushrooms will be an extra charge.   In my opinion if you are gonna eat this bad for this price it might as well be good!",

    "text": "I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak today and so after considering the reviews of a number of restaurants offering them. I decided that Corleone's was the best bet for a real Philadelphia style cheese steak near my zip code.   Because it is a chain, I arrived slightly skeptical, and ready to have a less than wonderful experience, in spite of the positive ratings. Thank goodness the positive reviews were accurate!  I arrived barely ahead of the lunch crowd. At least 15 people crowded in right behind me, which I took for a good sign. I ordered the small rib eye steak sandwich \"wit\" (with) grilled onions, grilled peppers & mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. I skipped the cheese wiz because my memory of Philly cheese steaks in Philly and NY as I was growing up had NO association what-so-ever with cheese wiz. The young man who took my order was very helpful with my order, and my eventual cheese choice of mozzarella over provolone.  (Mozzarella melts better he said, and he was right!)  My sandwich was completely cooked to order. There was no partially cooked steak sitting to the side of a grill waiting to be warmed and served - this was cooked fresh! The onions, mushrooms and green peppers were also perfectly grilled, and combined with the meat and mozzarella cheese were perfect! The bun initially had a bit of crunch, so I think that the inside was grilled or toasted.  All in all, it was a delicious sandwich. The meat was nicely cooked and the sandwich was nice and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I added a combination of the hot cherry peppers and a few sweet cherry peppers from the condiment bar to my sandwich to make each bite just right. The cheese was perfectly hot and melted, creating delicious strands of cheese from the sandwich to my mouth. Once I started eating, I could not put the sandwich down. It was REALLY good. FAR better than I would have expected from a Philly Cheese Steak in Arizona...  I didn't try any of the sides, but the pizza did look really good. I think it will be a while however, before I have anything but the cheese steak - just like I had it today!  For a small cheese steak and a small drink, my tab was nine dollars and change, but it was worth every penny!",

Also when you get one to go and the grease is coming out the bag, you know you are in for a treat. If you want one of the best cheesesteaks in Arizona then you need to come down and ask for a cheese wit. Trust me when I say you will not find another better in this state, or any other state for that matter. Also when you walk in and hear all the east coast accents you know they know what they are doing. Even though some of the guys are Giants fans . FLY EAGLES FLY",

Mostly because it's a chain and I'm generally opposed to such establishments. However, there's just something I like about this place. The decor and vibe even feels like you're in a little, slightly shady sandwich shop in Philly. Not that I've ever been to Philly, but it's stereotypical of what I would expect it to be like.   I think one of the Rocky movies has been playing on the one tv each time I've been here. There's a pyramid of Cheez Whiz cans. Philadelphia Eagles stuff, and of course a picture of the namesake Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the wall.   Do they make the best Philly cheesesteak I've had? No. But it is pretty good. The last time I was here I tried a slice of their pizza because it looked fantastic... Lo and Behold it was really good, thin crust deliciousness. One of the better pizza slices I've had in Phoenix, believe it or not.   To top everything off, the guys that work here have been friendly on both visits.. not bubbly friendly, but cool guy friendly. They welcome you, say goodbye and thank you for coming... but they do it cool... You know what I mean. I think that goes with the Philly atmosphere too.  Overall, if you're in the area and looking for a decent bite to eat, this is a good choice.   **Insert cliche' Godfather phrase closing statement here**",

Not sure what has happened to this place but the last time we ordered they forgot the three sodas that we paid for and said \"we will just add credit to your next tab\". This would've been fine, but then we realized they forgot all of the ranch we ordered. We had a big group of people over so we ordered about 6 ranch. When I called and asked for some ranch to be delivered the guy (I think his name was Joseph B) claimed that we didn't order any and that they were going to be closing (it was only 9:00)...how the hell are we supposed to eat chicken wings without ranch?! And I am positive we ordered extra ranch because I do every time and my friends confirmed that I did. THEN... we ate some of the wings anyways and they were so dry that it tasted like we were biting and chewing pure chicken bone rather than getting any meat at all. It was a really terrible experience and their lack of customer service has pushed me to take my business elsewhere. They can keep the $5 they owe me from their mistake of forgetting our sodas. You couldn't pay me to order from here again!",

Coreone's is a Genuine Taste of Philly as they make their Rib Eye Steak Sandwiches on Philly's Amoroso's Rolls. I didn't try the soft pretzels but I can tell you they sure LOOK like real Philly Pretzels you'd but off street corners. If your in the mood for dessert they also sell Philly's Famous TastyKakes that everyone knows. The casual place sure makes anyone from Philadelphia fell at home with that old Philadelphia look and all the really interesting iconic Philadelphia Memorabilia all around with a \"Rocky Movie\" playing on one of the TV's.   I tried a small steak combo. The small is plenty big and at least half the people out there only need a small. The ingredients are right so it passes as a Philly Steak Sandwich. Technically I'd like the sandwich tweaked a little different and the meat and onions less chopped up but it was still a good sandwich. I helped myself to the condiment bar and added HOT CHERRY PEPPERS and a few sweet cherry peppers and they were really good. For me it isn't a Philly Steak unless you have those delicious Cherry Peppers on it.    I wasn't a big fan of the onion rings but the fries were good.  My husband had the regular size combo. He ate many more cheese steaks in Philly than I did. He thought it was the best Cheese Steak he had in Arizona so far. I thought the regular size one was enormous and can feed two people. I asked my husband if he would get a small size next time and he said NO WAY.   They offer other menu items like Philly Style Pizza (I might try next time and tell you if it is)  Chicken Steaks and Hoagies.  For me this really was a  fun \"TASTE of Philadelphia\" and I didn't have to drive down the Schuylkill to get there.",

I dont know how it could have been any better.   Oh wait, it was, the fries made it the perfect American lunch. They were amazing with the Cheese Steak. Golden, crispy and delicious!   I am so full though, couldn't even finish the fries, I would definitely get a small if it is your first time, you won't be disappointed!   All of that wrapped up in a fun old time feel, with tall booths, wood tables and Philly memorabilia that made me miss the East coast all over again. They had Sports on a couple TVs and the movie Rocky playing on another. The music was a nice background, and not too loud, so you could hold a conversation.   The staff were really nice, but the service was really quick for being so busy. It makes me want to come back over and over again!   Found a new favorite!",

This was my favorite place to eat while I lived in Phoenix, by far, and what I miss most about the whole state.  It's pathetic, I know.  The restaurant has pretty awesome ambience for a sports fan, big wooden tables and lots of screens playing ESPN or whatever big game is on.  I've come here for a couple games and stayed with friends to watch half a game.  The cheesesteak is fine (though I'd never choose it over the buffalo chicken).  I've tried \"da Roc and Manuch\", but it's just a bland marinara chicken sub.  The Godfather sounded promising, and normally I love italian-meat sandwiches, but it's just too heavy and the bread doesn't really work with this kind of sandwich.  Being my favorite place, I'm bummed to see so many poor reviews.  But they are mostly legit complaints.  The service can be pretty terrible, and it seems they only hire jerks to work the line.  The meals are expensive--it's like $12 for a meal with fries and drink.  But if you get the coupons and their occasional emails, it drops down to $5 for the same thing.  The delivery also does take a while, but whenever I'd have it delivered to work, I'd just make sure to order it an hour ahead and they're usually there when they say they'll make it.  Overall, it's a pricy place but you get what you pay for.  It's an original and unique place, definitely worth eating in at.",

    "text": "Eh.  I can't speak to their cheeseteaks, as I've only ever ordered pizza (always delivery, through GrubHub). The delivery times have always been accurate for me, and the food arrives pretty hot.  Their pizza is pretty basic. No this really flashy or high quality, just pizza for pizza's sake.  I found it odd, and kinda gross, that when I ordered bell peppers and onion on my pizza, it came with the same cooked-on-the-flat-top, limp and overcooked peppers and onions that would come on a cheeseteak sandwich. Does anyone else find this unusual? I get trying to save time and/or money by topping pizzas with their already-prepared veggies, but come on. Any place serving respectable pizza should have raw, fresh peppers and onions to top their pizzas, IMHO.  That said, their sauce is pretty good and the crust ain't bad. Pizza probably better suited to accompany some beers, and nothing you'd go out of your way for.",

    "text": "this was a pretty damn good food joint here.  honestly.  and instead of all caps, i'll do my review with no caps at all  * first of all, damn good meatball sub.  i spent 40 minutes in traffic on the 202, had enough, re-routed, ordered a meatball parm, shut down for a break.  the good news is, good meatball, good sauce, really good bread.  No, really pretty good.  I give it a 6.2...noticeably better than Subway.   because you really don't know how mediocre Subway bread is, and it's not bad, but you don't really know how mediocre it is until you eat better bread.  this is better bread.  not bianco bread, but better;  * the bad news is, there's no parm on this sandwich.  in fact, i'd be willing bet there's no \"parm\" anywhere near this joint.  define parm, buddy.  and if it's a meatball parm, that parm would be short for parmesan and there wasn't a shred of parm-E-San, it's not really a meatball PARM.  PLEASE DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE WONDERS OF CHEESE-WIZ, 70% if their business.   * I asked for a side of sauce and was disappointed when it was given cold-how does that make sense?  why would i want cold marinara on what is supposed to be a pipping-hot sandwich? MAKES NO SENSE.  the friendly guy behind the line, kinda young, ball cap, thank you.  you were helpful, friendly, thank you.  the other guy?  older, facial hair...can i say f-you, you f-ing a$$?  what are you doing in the service business when clearly you hate customers?;  * THE SIDE STUFF: SWEET PEPPERS/SPORT PEPPERS ARE FRIGGING EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Far back of the restaurant) SERIOUSLY.  Hot, sour, sweet,   let me summarize this:  GIVEN: the meatball parm i got this day, the better-than-average-bread, along with these side peppers, the overall taste, flavor (same?) and price, I would go back.  Yes. now, lets discuss the Tuesday special: my Regular meatball parm, like, $8.00, on a Tuesday, after 4pm, I got any other sandwich same size for free.  See My Receipt!!!!  Again, this is a good sandwich, great price for the area or not, I'm gonna go back.  just gonna avoid the guy cooking anger than me.",

Here is what was good:   1- ordering through the Yelp app was very easy and my order arrived earlier than scheduled and was delivered by a very nice person; 2- our onion rings were super crispy and wonderful and they accommodated our request for lots of extra ketchup; 3- our antipasto salad was simple and fresh and came with chips and a drink.  Not so good: We were going to share the buffalo chicken sandwich... but ended up not being what either one of us expected or enjoyed. It was finally minced chicken, smothered in buffalo sauce, and stuffed into soft hero bread doused in blue cheese dressing. The way they did the meat was just odd. Granted, the Yelp app did not provide any description of the sandwich beyond the name, and I chose to order it anyway, so it was my own fault for assuming that it was going to be different from what I received. Nonetheless it grossed us both out and left me feeling like despite the positives, I probably would not order from this restaurant again.",

We ordered 2 sandwiches: the steak Italiano and the buffalo chicken. The first came without the onions I ordered and the second came without the ranch I ordered (it was literally just bread and chicken). I even went as far as requesting both the onions and the ranch on the side. What we got was extremely mediocre sandwiches. I gave 2 starts because it was food and it the sandwiches were eatable.    The french fries were cold, soggy and tasted like freezer burn. They were not accompanied by any ketchup to make them even minimally palatable. They went straight into the trash bin.   This 'meal' took a full hour to arrive (which yelp did warn us about). In short: I do not think it would be worth the gas or effort to drive to this place to get food, and its not worth a 60 min wait for delivery.",

That being said, I was invited to Corleone's and was told I had to try the Cheesesteak since I never had an authentic one. I was not disappointed. I ordered it 'onions and whiz wit' despite the fact that I usually like really good cheese. I am a HUGE fan of what I ate. The steak is really good rib eye; not some cheap, fatty mystery piece of cow. That's why you're paying so much for the sandwich. There is a row of condiments that include oregano and red pepper flake shakers and peppers in vinegar. I added those to my sandwich too. The bread is fluffy and tender; easy to bite through. The meat is choppeed just right; it's tender and juicy. The Cheez Wiz... well, it's just good stuff in this sandwich. I never thought I'd say that, but if you haven't had it wiz wit, you gotta try it that way. You won't be disappointed.  The whole sandwich is an enormous order, but because I splurge on foods like this so rarely, I get the whole thing when I do. Like others said, I think the price is a little high, but man, I love these sandwiches.",

There were two orders in front of him which were already placed and it took them 10 minutes to then take his order of a Philly Cheese Steak, Onion Rings and a drink. By this time i had gone to Jimmy Johns, got my order, and walked over to CVS to pick something up, and walked back to Corleones to get my brother. We waited a few minutes and then his order finally came. I asked what his total was, almost $16!! They charged extra for Onions and Mushrooms (or peppers, can't remember) $1.49 each! These come standard on Philly cheese steaks and we know this because we lived in Philadelphia for 4 years with many real cheese steaks had that were WAY better and 2/3 the price!! My brother said it tasted good, but not for that price and he would have rather gone to Duck & Decanter, Wineburger (both down the road) or even Postinos just for some Bruschetta. If i were him i would rather just go up the road to the Rokerji's reverse Happy hour starting at 9 and get a glass of wine ($5), and their tip steak + Brei bruschetta bites ($5).",

Their Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is really good and their fries are also quite tasty.  So why, you might ask, am I only giving it 3 stars? A couple reasons:  - Although it is a good sandwich, I think it is overpriced. If you want to get a sandwich combo, you're going to walk out paying 13 dollars. - The staff isn't particularly nice..they're not mean, but I wouldn't say they are nice. - And not that they did this on purpose, but I walked in and used a coupon once (which wasn't that great of a deal), ordered food, sat down, and saw a sign offering a special for that day that was WAY better than my coupon. I really wish the guy who rung me up (who might have been the owner) had mentioned it.  Conclusion: This place isn't bad and some people may feel it's 4-5 star good, I just don't feel it's worth the price.",

The service is amazing at Camelback, free extra cheese, etc.  The manager there is so friendly! The service at Mill has been hit and miss.

I'm not sure why it took me so long to build up my courage to try this place, but I finally ventured in today for lunch. While not the best sandwich I've had, this definitely fills the need. Juicy flavorful sandwich with super soft fresh bread.   The place is REALLY clean. They've only had 2 major health violations in the nearly 2 years they've been open. Most restaurants typically have 2-3 PER VISIT.   I had the 6\" cheese steak with provolone and grilled onions. I loved that the grilled onions were thinly diced and not the typically stringy style. There was the perfect amount of them, not a heaping distraction from the great steak.   The fries were perfectly crispy (slightly overcooked, which I love) and hot.   The diet coke tasted great as well.   All this for under $10? Not too bad. I'll be back for sure!",

Drove around for a bit until I saw Corleone's, and since I was in a cheesesteak mood, headed on it (it also helped that a sporting event that I wanted to see was on at the time and I knew they had tv's).   I'd also been to the Corleone's in Scottsdale in the past, and had remembered liking it.  I ordered the large philly (whiz witout) and no fries (though from the past, the cheesefries are great) since as a general rule (which failed this time), it's usually best to save the stomach room for the cheesesteak, rather than add on the fries. The food came out in a suitable amount of time, and I didn't think I was deliberate in eating it...however towards the last 1/4 of the sandwich, the meat/cheese was already getting cold, it was kind of weird.  Anywho, I ate the whole thing (note:  $10 is probably a little pricey, I think they must know this, as I got two coupons from them while there, one for $2 off next time, one for BOGOF).    Fast forward a few hours later, and I'm at my desk with food baby from stuffing myself.  Stupid me for eating so much was my initial thought.  Except that my tummy was unsettled for the next two days.  Now...I can't say for sure that it was Corleone's...but I'm pretty sure, so not too pleased about that.  I mean, if the sandwich had been good, it totally would have been worth it, but it was ok, and not a great value.  Not sure if I'll be back.  2.5 stars, only rounded up because my prior experiences in Scottsdale were better than here.",

I get the east coast \"attitude\" thing but i think here its more of \"when is it closing time\" for these employees.  I was charged for xtra toppings on my cheesesteak and when i got the sandwich... No toppings!  Then it was an argument with the cook so i had to bring my philly up to the line to SHOW him there were no toppings!  Overpriced... Bad customer service... But free delivery... U decide.",

It's a cheap and quick meal and tastes really good. The fries are pretty above average too. The people who take your order behind the counter are pretty gruff, but they consistently deliver a good product and have seen them be accommodating to other customers by wiping down tables for them and apologize they were less than clean so that really impressed me.",

I give it my stamp of approval too.  Here we go.  Great Philly's... They call 'em cheesesteaks, I call 'em philly's... Who cares.  Watch out though, they'll dump a bunch of cheese whiz on your sandwhich if you don't ask for provolone.  Oh, also... if you want peppers on your philly, you have to ask for it.  Great service!  We even changed our order at the pick-up window and they had NO problem fixing it!  Fries were great with the supplied... wait for it... MALT VINEGAR! Yay!!!!!!  They have state of the art ice tea machines that make you feel like a rocket scientist when you use them.  The provolone is mixed in with the steak before they put it in your buns (ouch!) so it is nice and meltilicious...  The decor is godfather meets rocky balboa with a twist of 1920's depression. Yes, yes... it IS industrial decor like all the new chains, but it fits!!!!!  Thinking of going somewhere else for a philly? Fogettaboutit!",

    "text": "With the Eagles playing today and being married to a philly native we were destined to eat a cheese steak today! Must be good luck.. right?! This was my first time to Corleone's. I never felt so stupid till I try to order... wiz, wit, witout, with what!??? Lol I just look at my husband like please just order for me, it's cool. Haha I got it down now though so next visit I'll be a big girl.  I got the original philly cheese steak wit onions, green peppers, wiz, and toasted. HOLY AMAZINGNESS! The wiz was creamy and delicious, the meat was tender, and bread had the perfect crunch with being toasted. I might even get extra wiz next time. We also got the buffalo chicken with ranch and mozzarella. It's was very good yet super messy. Not too Spicy. We each got a combo with regular fries and cheese fries. The fries are super good and have the perfect crisp. The cheese fries were amazing!  Few tips I learned today: 1. Get extra wiz so it's layered on top.. mmmm 2. Toasted bread 3. Cheese fries. Yum! 4. Add grilled green peppers  They do have a pickled pepper bar to add to your sandwich in addition if you like that. I'm not crazy about those sweet papers but my husband likes them.   Overall everything was very tasty and I'm excited to come back. Friendly and quick service. I really liked the philly/eagle decor in this shop. Makes you really feel like your back in philly with the atmosphere and food. You know your married to a philly guy when their 20reasons your from philly sign all applies to my husband and his family. Haha! Now for the game today.... Go Eagles!!!",

My dad and I have been on a sandwich/hoagie kick lately and decided to give Corleone's a try...boy are we glad we did!   On arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and a pretty cool environment. There were giant pizzas on display that looked delicious, and the smell of steak fries wafted in the air. The restaurant is not fancy by any means, but it makes you feel like you are in Philly. Rocky movies are playing on the TVs and there are pictures and signs all over relating to the city; it's a fun upbeat atmosphere.   After much deliberation over the menu we went with a buffalo chicken hoagie and an original cheez whiz cheesesteak. They gave us a number and we headed over to get fresh peppers and condiments at the little bar area they have set up. Something about free peppers makes you feel giddy inside. We waited a while for our food but it was obvious they were making it all fresh to order. The fries that I smelled walking in looked amazing, next time I'm getting fries! Our food arrived hot and ready to be devoured. My dad enjoyed his buffalo chicken and I loved my original with cheese whiz. Holy smokes I need more cheese whiz in my life!   Corleone's isn't exactly cheap, but it doesn't break the bank either. We enjoyed our food and experience and will be back to try more goodies on the menu!",

OK, I have been to South Philly and all the way to 9th and Passyunk Ave. That is where the Philly started and Geno's and Pat's are still contending.    The secret is in the bun and the meat. As a Philly purist, I always want provolone cheese on mine. In Phoenix, Cheez Whiz is the main option. This joint wants to charge extra for green peppers, in Philly they come standard.     Our two Philly Cheesesteaks were great despite their use of Cheez Whiz. This is a good choice in Phoenix for Cheesesteaks.    The French fries were just average. That means my fav Five Guys still make the best fries.   This place is busy on weekend evenings. Get there early for your PHX Philly.",

I though cheez whiz was E-Z Cheez. Nope, it is something completely different. Combine that with the grilled onions, and perfectly grilled steak chunks? Hello taste bud meltdown experience.    And the Cheez Whiz fries with grilled onions? HOLY Mother of God are those GOOOOOD! I don't even want to take a guess on what the caloric intake is on either- but if you don't care, or only want to eat once that week anyway- take a trip to Corleone's. You won't regret it.

Don't get me wrong - the food is alright and their delivery is fairly reliable, but all of a sudden they've decided to go all-out with an unbelievably intrusive marketing 'strategy'.  I've ordered from them about once a month for the past 5 months, never signed up for any 'loyalty' (translation:  \"Sell my personal details and spam me mercilessly\") program, nor given them any permission to contact me for anything other than the particular order I've placed.  As of today, I've started getting unsolicited txt messages (3 today within 2 hours) from Corleone's telling me that I've been automatically signed up for their 'spam my phone' service and then asking for personal details like birthdate - allegedly so I can get some birthday bonus or whatever.    In my world, Corleone's now sleeps with the fishes - I'll get my pizza and cheesesteaks elsewhere from now on.",

Which was fine, then 25 mins after that I get another call asking what drinks were ordered. Finally the food arrives after an hour and 15 minute wait. It was cold and completely wrong. I called back to tell them of the mistake and The so called \"manager\" gets into an argument with me saying the order was correct and the best he could do was 20% off my NEXT order. No offer to fix or replace so I tell them to pick up the sandwich and just refund me and I get into another argument saying he can only refund minus the tip because he would be in the negative. Seriously, OVER A FUCKING CHEESESTEAK. 15 mins he calls back and says I voided the card for you. What a joke. I would never order from this place just off the fact that if something is wrong you have to pull teeth just to get your money back. A simple sorry and a refund or an offer to send the proper food out would have been nice. Instead they want to make everything difficult and argue with the customer.   Working in customer service myself I have learned that in no circumstance should you argue with anybody. It's just common sense.  I've refunded people for a lot more than a shitty 12.00 sandwich without blinking or arguing. I know if I didn't I would get fired. But then again I could always apply at Corleone's and tell every customer to fuck off and be just fine. There is definitely a reason to this location is getting 3 stars overall.",

I even waited until after I ate to let my hunger subside before writing this review.  I placed my order this evening, received the confirmation, and was surprised to see a 45-60 min. wait for delivery.  Considering I ordered two sandwiches, which, at best, take 10 mins. to make, it seems like a long wait, but not unreasonable.  However, tonight, as was the case with my first two orders, it took an hour and a half for my food to be delivered.  When it arrived, the sandwiches were cold and a bit soggy.  Not surprising given the fact that they were likely sitting in the restaurant for an hour and 20 mins.  Each time, they've claimed to be shorthanded with delivery drivers that night.  But 3/3 times over a period of months?  It may be time to hire more delivery drivers.    Avoid this place (for delivery, at least) unless you want to wait until the point of hanger and then eat cold, soggy sandwiches.",

However if you want to walk into an authentic Mafioso looking deli-restaurant with a sandwich, an epicurean delight, that will give you multiple foodgasms than \"Yo, how you doin'!\"   All I'll say is that the smooth taste and texture of the Philly Cheese steak sandwich was incredibly flavorful, and beyond delicious! Enough to have your eyes roll back in your head and possibly shout \"this is so fing good!!\"   When you walk in this joint there is a large profile picture of Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, with the words;  \"Make 'Em A Sandwich They Can't Refuse!\"  Now that's a Slogan!   They even have a real Pickle Bar with banana peppers, hot peppers, and homemade salt pickles. I loved it!!!   \"Bing, Bang, Boom!\" I scarfed mine down and I wanted more.",

    "text": "*edited  When I wrote my original review I was hangry.  Waiting 2 hours for a food delivery order will do that to you.   I eat here often as the 16th street location is near my work.  The food is usually pretty good. If this were a dine-in only review I would probably give the place 3-4 stars. However this review also takes into account my one and only online delivery order and that brings the score down quite a bit. Today, I was stuck at work over my lunch break so I put in an online order for delivery. The confirmation came back and said it would be 1 hour, which I thought was a long time since the sandwich takes 10 minutes and they are only 8 blocks away. (Jimmy Johns is right next door to them and they are usually here within 20 minutes, different restaurant, I know!)  Anyway, 1 hour came and went, then 1h30m, finally at 2 hours my food was delivered...or someone's food was delivered.  My sandwich was wrong (asked for no onions, got onions, asked for iced tea, got soda, asked for side of cheese wiz for my fries, got none).  The fries were cold and soggy also. I called the restaurant right away.  After talking to an employee for a few minutes, he gave up and transferred me to the manager.  He offered to remake the food and send it back out, but having already waited 2 hours I asked for a refund instead.  *long pause...okay, I'll refund your card.  I am giving back a star for the willingness to correct their mistake and refund me. So long story short, dine in, don't get delivery, you will be much happier with your meal.",

I used that same spiel on my mom when I took her and she frowned at Cheez Whiz being on her sandwich. Needless to say, we were both wrong. The Philly Cheese Steak at Corleone's is amazing.

My wife brought me the cheesesteak fries last night. My life is changed! I have a new appreciation for Corleone's now. Its so good, it will have you licking the cheese off of the tray paper (if you are a True Cheese Whiz fan). Of course, we had the cheesesteaks as well...don't tell me how many calories were in both the big cheesesteak sandwich and the cheesesteak fries...I'm having at the present point not knowing. I'll exercise later today!  Just know their food is EXCELLENT! I need to plan a trip to the top cheesesteak places in Philly one day for a comparison, but in my book, Corleone's is top notch!",

Told us at 60 minutes the driver was in the car. Told us at 110 minutes that driver left 15 minutes ago. One of those has to be a lie, right?  Told us \"Online says it's 50min but really it is 90min.\"  Food arrived 2hrs late. On dot. They never tried to update us or treat us honestly, just kept feeding us lines. Kept calling me \"boss\" which I wish were True. Driver was nice enough and hustled, said he wasn't even a driver but instead a cook. Don't know who to blame. But I know we won't be calling Corleone's again. Or going in person.",

They said it couldn't be redeemed because it had to be printed out to get it free, even though it didn't state that ANYWHERE and it had a bar code and could show my ID that it was my birthday. It should be clearly stated if that is the restaurant policy before people go out of their way to go to that place. They were rude about it and couldn't explain why it wasn't listed or at least put a sign up at the register stating that.

There were a lot of campers, so really not a place to sit, and there isn't much room to start. Perhaps they had some sort of A/C issue because they had some huge...like HUGE fan/external cooling unit thing sitting in front of the bathroom hallway.  There were 4 people in front of us and it took about 20 minutes to get our food, not so good if you are in a hurry...and we were.  We ordered two cheesesteaks and an order of fries to share... fries were $2+ and barely got a handful, felt pretty ripped off frankly. Even more so after the wait when I took a bite to find out the fries were lukewarm at best. sigh.  I am hoping this was an off day and not a sign of change.  The food is delicious and the fries are (usually) worth craving...   I'll be back, hopefully I will have a more positive experience next time.   And hopefully they open one in the SW Valley sometime, that would be cool ya know!",

This sandwich was right on point, filled was lots of delicious deli meats. I godfathered it and added pepperoni. The regular size was so huge I could only eat half. The guy at the register was nice and even remebered us and said here's youse guys order without calling our number when it was ready. The oil and vinegar is what I normally add on my sandwiches and theirs was great. I've ordered Jimmy John's Italian night club when I go there and if you've ever had that Corleon's is 100 times better. Its about the same price and at Corleon's the meats are way better quality, a bigger sandwich and overall tastes way better. The only negative thing I have to say is there was no napkins in the bag and I forgot to grab some when we were waiting. I definitely know where to go next time I'm craving a sandwich and even though the Italian hoagie was great I'm going to try the cheesesteak.",
