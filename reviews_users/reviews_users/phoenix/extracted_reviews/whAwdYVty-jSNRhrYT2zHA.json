The swamp thing was really good. The catfish beignets were delicious. I didn't love the fondeaux though. First of all it had mushrooms in it and I hate mushrooms. But also the shrimp tasted like dirty dishwater, which is not unusual for shrimp in my opinion, but that ruined the fondeaux for me. Overall my experience was A-Ok.",

She took time to tell us what each dish was as this was our first time there. She was Awesome! And our two bartenders who took care of us Nick and Missy, hooked us up on the lump crab & spinach dish which was amazing. The food here was very good, and these three persons great service will definitely bring us back!!",

This time we were there in the middle of the week so there was no wait for a table.    We went the same route on the appetizers with alligator and oysters.  No sense messing with perfection.  The hubby ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  Expensive but fabulous.  I stole a couple of bites and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Heavenly!  I wasn't very hungry after appetizers so I just had a bowl of Lobster Bisque.  HUGE chunks of lobster in there and so warm and satisfying.  This will be my choice from now on if I'm not feeling super hungry.    Pappadeaux definitely has my vote as the best seafood place in Phoenix.",

Seven of  us lunched here and all were very satisfied.  The appetizer was about the the best and lightest deep fried calamari I've had in years, the gumbo was authentic and good, and my fried oysters were wonderfully done.  The seafood pasta dishes, fried shrimp, tilapia and catfish got high praise from the others. The batter on everything was light with no hint of oiliness. I lived in new Orleans for several years.  Cajun style food this good with uncommonly courteous service in the New Orleans manner  would get praise on the Gulf...to find it in desert-bound Phoenix AZ is amazing. The drinks are great too but I give only 4 stars because its become pricey. Figure about $50 each with two drinks per.",

I ordered the Seafood Platter ($25) while my friend ordered a pasta and seafood dish ($30).  Our waiter was Brian and he was a friendly guy. He appeared to be new as he had to see the menu to know what sides and such we would receive.  The blue lump crab cake was good, but not as good as I remembered. All the food seemed to taste the same.  I also had the spaghetti squash and it was fairly bland. My friend devoured her pasta and seafood dish, but it wasn't much food for the price.",

    "text": "A solid cajun restaurant.  I really like gumbo - ambrosia for the gods as far as I'm concerned (the gods miraculously don't gain weight from it).  Yes, I've had better gumbo elsewhere, but the gumbo here was quite flavorful and I enjoyed it.  I tend to prefer the creole gumbo which is usually thicker than the cajun gumbo (the gumbo here seemed to be of the thinner cajun variety), but meh, it was still good.  I only ate here for lunch.  So, I got the gumbo with a half po-boy.  The po-boy was also quite good.  I picked the shrimp version.  Could have used more shrimp on the po-boy to fill it out a bit more, but again, not a deal breaker.  Price is tipped on the higher end for my usual standards.  This is expected for any place that serves seafood though.  So, I wasn't surprised.  My server was excellent.  Polite, knowledgeable, prompt.  Can't complain.  Ambience.  Again, can't complain.  Seemed nice, though from what I read, it can get loud at dinner.",

Typically I will have appetizers (mussels, clams, some gumbo, etc.) but I've also had the trout (which was delicious).  I find their food seasoned well, balanced in flavor, and visually appetizing without tasting too greasy or obnoxiously oily/buttery.  They are open late as well, and the drinks are outstanding.  Fresh lime juice margaritas, not too sweet, with Patron where they don't skimp on the booze?  What can be better?  Pardon my brevity on this review, but just go and you won't be disappointed.  Hats off to the Pappas' group for bringing a great restaurant to Phoenix.  Please don't expand and ruin a good thing either!",

He was so accommodating that I just had to write another review on it.  I had to order my usual Talapia and it was fantastic as well.  I also did not know that they ship in new seafood daily and everything here is homemade, which is probably why this place is full of awesomeness!",

Sorry but I don't remember what I had but I just wasn't impressed and didn't get the feeling the seafood was really fresh. I guess I will continue to look for a place to get fried seafood in Arizona.  If you are expecting Pappadeaux like it is in Texas don't go here. If you are expecting Legal Seafood don't go here.",

    "text": "Oh, where to begin..  I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.  The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.    I'm so glad we did.   We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.  After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night..   About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..  After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food.   I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.",

My husband and I have been here 4 times now and every time it's been nothing but the best dinner ever.  A must you must get or try whatever floats your boat is the alligator tail. Don't be so quick to judge this taste appetizer we usually get half blacked half deep fried. Our 8 year old says it's his favorite thing to get when we come. And we all know kids are picky but he loves it. Our last time in we got that and we got the trio which came with calamari, this mini shrimp/crawfish cheese dip and the alligator tail. The dip was amazing only down side is that it only came with 2 little slices of bread we were a large party of 8.  I always go in and get the giant shrimp with giants it's a no fail amazing dish. My husband is always daring and willing to try something different but his all time favorite to get is Atlantic salmon Yvette... it's his favorite other then the gumbo lol. And you can't leave without getting a dessert Come eat make a reservation before you come in It's amazing",

Then I ordered Halibut in garlic butter sauce and  a Shrimp and Jumbo Lump Crab Cobb Salad, both were exceptional and the portions are huge. We were full but went ahead and ordered a piece of Key Lime Pie with a praline and graham cracker crust it came with fresh whipped creams and a raspberry sauce.

My waitress was extremely aggressive, it's common sense to cater to who you're serving. One of the people I was with wanted to know the price difference between a smaller and larger glass of wine, the waitress didn't know which is totally understandable and we would never expect for them to know off the top of their head but at that point is when you check and find out. She asked but wasn't nice about it. I ordered my food and asked for the sauce on the side (which is was) but the shrimp was in the sauce, the reason why I wanted it on the side is for portion control which is pretty obvious. Aside from that, my fish was too salty. The waitresses short and aggressive attitude was not welcoming at all. She could have had a bad day to give her the benefit of the doubt but the food was not that great either. Not sure what the hype is all about, I probably wouldn't come back again.",

I'm talking fish and shrimp from water to plate in 10-20 minutes! This place is amazing! Not only did it taste fresh, but it was fresh!

My husband ordered the pasta with scallops, shrimp and octopus which came out ice cold and had to be sent back. It was completely tasteless and after being warned about the \"cajun\" flare that it would be spicy was the opposite and bland. We had the oysters in romano cheese, these were really great, but I ended up sick all night.  We walked out with $145.00 less in our pockets and quite dissatisfied.  Service was mediocre and they leave trays of dirty food in and around the tables.  I had to ask that the one next to me be moved as it was gross looking at other patrons dirty plates. Atmosphere is great, but we will not be returning! My advice, go to Blue Water Grill, you'll get more bang for your buck.",

If it was fresh halibut I think it would take a little bit longer to cook. The halibut did not taste fresh and was really mushy and fishy tasting. We never received the salads.

    "text": "First time dining here....extremely disappointed. We dined for my girlfriends birthday on a Friday night. It was a very busy night, which was encouraging in the hopes that a lot of people obviously like eating here. We sat at a round table in a corner of the dining room (we had a party of 6). Even though we were in a corner, it was extremely loud. I could barely hear my girlfriend who was sitting next to me...not much anyone can do about that, so that's not why I'm giving them 2 stars.   The reason why is whoever is on the grill in the kitchen needs to find a new profession. I ordered the Fillet with lobster tail, and for paying upwards of $60 for that plate, my expectations should be somewhat high. Boy was I let down. I ordered the steak medium rare, it came out charred on the outside (literally crunchy each bite) yet bloody and undercooked on the inside. I hate sending food back, but for what I'm paying, I had no choice. The lobster was a bit dry, but I ate it anyways. By the time the second Fillet came out, everyone else had finished their meals. As soon as I laid eyes on it I could tell it was under cooked....again. It was so freaking bloody, I swear I heard it Moo. I could barely cut into it, it was so freaking rare. At that point I just told the waiter (who was a nice guy) that I did not want another one. He took it off the bill, as expected.   Overall, if you're going to spend that kind of money on a nice dinner, don't waste your money here.",

    "text": "Soooo disappointed. We use to love Pappadeaux, but it wasn't good this time. We moved to Sedona and brought friends down to enjoy a great seafood restaurant, but it wasn't the same. All of our dishes came out cold. Clam chowder, they did take off because it was sent back. No one had eaten their fries, and our friend had left most of his shrimp. The oysters were great!!!  Our poor server was overwhelmed and was lacking on refills and forgot most of what we had asked for. We would love to bring more friends back, but probably will not make the drive, since it's not the same. Too bad.",

    "text": "I had reservations at 8pm on Feb 10th, for 17. 17 wasn't able to make it which they stated was fine. It was 14 of us. They informed me that as long as majority of my party was there they'd seat us by 8p, well my whole party of 14 was at the establishment by 745. I informed them that my party was here they reassured me they'd get us seated. 805 comes around we're still waiting by the bar, my party was hungry and their feet were getting tired. I asked the, rude and dismissive, woman upfront and one stated their getting the tables together now, it'll be just a moment longer. So, 820/830 rolls around, now \"it's the party won't leave, they've been there for over 3hrs, and i cant ask them to leave, Im sorry\"...and this was stated by Kathy the Hispanic manager. We were not seated until after 9pm...approx 930 was when my party and I were seated at two different tables, not one as promised. The waiter Mike was awesome but the food was bland, and mediocre I did not eat my entree and neither did my friend next to me. It seemed rushed, taking they close at 10, it might've been. The manager did offer us free appetizers...but my whole birthday experience was ruined because of how they lied to us and then separated us at the tables, and made less than mediocre food. When I asked at 805 if we were getting seated she should have gotten the manager and told me the truth then, and the manager kept stating we'd be seated soon, but soon was an hr and a half later. Had I known they gave our table to another party we could've left and ate somewhere else. My friends/family and I loved Pappadeux before this horrible experience. We won't be giving them anymore of our service. Thanks for making my birthday experience and unforgettable one by the way we were treated.",

Although there was a bright spot and that was our waitress Latica, she was the best part of the evening. We got there and was seated then ordered and it took 55 mins to get our food. Latica kept apologizing for wait and she offered a Salad or Bread. Then when the food came it was one the worst meals that I have had. There was so much water in the plate that the food had no taste. The Shrimp and Scallops were both over cooked. The waitress got the manager to come over and he acted like that he didn't even care. So we told the waitress that we were ready to leave and paid the bill and left. Again the best part of the waitress.",

    "text": "So our night begins with arriving at Pappadeaux at 6pm with my family for my mother birthday. Wait time is an hour to an hour and half (which is to be expected for a family of 17 on a Friday night). We are finally seated at 745pm and dinner orders are taken within 10-15mins. Time ticks away and no food, more time and still no food. Asked our server, along with another server and what seems to be a manager and all three gave us the same seemingly rude perhaps rehearsed responses which basically blamed us for having a large party. As a paying customer we should NEVER be treated as an inconvenience or daunting task. Again it's to be expected to have a wait for our food BUT NEVER place blame and attitude on your customers! I'm so disappointed and saddened to see my mothers birthday dinner ruined, especially after seeing and hearing her excitement all week. Her favorite cake was also brought to the restaurant but by that point mom was so upset she just took the cake home! After so many years of enjoying Pappadeaux, I will never again let a restaurant spoiled a family members birthday!",

My boyfriend had the Mardi Gras pasta and the sausage in it was the best thing on the table.  I had the sweet potato pecan pie for dessert and I could eat a whole pie of that! The creme brulee looked awesome, but no one at the table ordered it. That will be for next time.   I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving creole or seafood...or both!! It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!",

Brenda, our server, was so helpful and suggested different ways we could try our selection of foods. She was on point with checking in at our table to make sure everything was good. Drinks never went empty and the food arrived one right after the other. Our bartender came by our table and it was then we learned he was actually one of the managers. Forrest had heard it was our first visit and wanted to  expressed his gratitude that we chose to visit Papadeaux's and even went out of his way to make sure our first visit was perfect. I've never been so pleased with a restaurant before visiting Papadeaux's so a big thank you to Brenda and Forrest.

Waited 15 minutes for our first waiter visit, then another 15 minutes for a glass of water, so we were 45 minutes in before ordering. I had such high hopes for a good sea food experience in the desert. Their menu says, \"fresh fish flown in daily,\" but I know what frozen filets taste like. I ordered the naked halibut. The Brussels sprouts were flavorful, burnt and very oily. Oily as in sitting in a pool of oil. The halibut might have been okay if it had come out to the table on time but it had obviously sat in the window for at least 15 or 20 minutes, because it was maybe just barely luke warm and extremely dry. I was tempted to suffer through it with a smile but three bites in I crunched into a small pebble. I gave up after that. My wife ordered the redfish risotto. The risotto was decent but the fish was cold, dry and over salted. Son ordered chicken fingers. They were extra extra well done (over fried) as well, and he said the fries tasted like cardboard. Truly disappointing.",

The bad: we were seated at a corner table in the main walkway directly outside the bussing station. Worst table in the house. We asked for another table as soon as we were sat there and the hostess told us we would have to go back on the wait list. We were re-sat in about 5 minutes. The next 2 couples they tried to sit at this table also asked for other seating. Our food took almost 45 minutes to come out. My scallops were overdone and the risotto was chewy and raw. It was very loud inside and hard to hear. Poor parking. All in all, if I could rate 3.5 stars I would.",

    "text": "My family ate here on Christmas eve.  The pros: crawfish bisque was excellent, the serve was great, the deserts were very good - large portions.  The cons: my Crawfish platter which included both Etoufee and fried crawfish was awful.  The etoufee had a dark brown gravy like taste that overwhelmed the few small pieces of crawfish it included over brown/dirty rice.  It was nasty, I picked out a few of the crawfish, but their flavor was overwhelmed with dark sauce -- I didn't eat.  The fried crawfish was a little better, but instead of being lightly fried, it was very small pieces of crawfish with heavy breading.  Basically, my meal was a waste - so I really didn't bother to eat much of it.  On the flip side, the rest of my family thought the place was pretty good -- not excellent, but good.  I would recommend avoiding the fried platters. My son ordered the chicken, he rated it as nothing special. I should mention that the noise level in the restaurant was extremely loud - so much so, there was a strong desire to exit as soon as possible, even possibly boxing the deserts to go home and eat instead.  Based on this experience, I have no plans to return.  UPDATE:  I guess Pappadeaux reads these reviews as they contacted me shortly after posting.  They asked if I'd be willing to give them another try when in Phoenix if they sent me a gift certificate.  I agreed, but even after providing address information, no certificate was ever received.  (In all fairness, I do know others who have visited other Pappadeaux locations and say it's great.  It just wasn't my experience.)",

Let's get right to it the shrimp po boy a foot long baguette with 5 pieces of tiny shrimp plenty of old lettuce and wilted tomatoes and the shrimp andouille gumbo is it supposed to taste like old tap water and tomato sauce? This by far was the most disappointing $80 ever spent . As we tried to stomach our food we observed other people also with disappointment bottom line the food was flavorless I wish I could turn back time on this dining experience wow!",

    "text": "Oh Lord how did I not review Pappadeaux's. I've been going here since the first night they opened and I stood in line for three hours to try their tasty food. This place is Louisiana amazing. The freshest tastiest fish. You can have frog legs & alligator tail if you country folk. I'm country folk, we come from the swamp in North Carolina. We eat fried everything. My favorite thing ever is the Pappadeaux's platter because it has so much food and the only thing better is the deluxe you can literally feed five grown adults or two hangry people. You get two fish fillets of your choice always get catfish. it's the best. Enough oysters and crawfish that it should be an appetizer. Then the most amazing stuffed crab.  When you think it can't get any better they break out with the stuffed shrimp as good as the crab.the mountain of french fries you get are some of the tastiest fries I've ever had. They remind me of childhood fries at home. Always get the gator no matter who you are. It's delicious, it tastes like the best chicken nuggets ever. The Po boys are amazing. I've had a steak here. Tasty, but why do you go to fish place for steak doesn't make sense. You can do it but I always say get the fish. Blackend is my favorite way to get any of the fish if it's not fried. the gator water and the swamp thing are my two favorite drinks I don't know which ones which but they both are delicious and I never get mad if I order the wrong one. When you see the lines you know it's a good thing I also saw my peoples waiting in line and I knew if they could sit through church all day long and then wait in line for some food, it was good. Oh snap you'll kick yourself if you don't try the sweet potato pecan pie with the bourbon sauce get it oh my God is it so good.",

Before i get into the food i have to say how amazing the atmosphere was. I absolutely loved the decor and the vibes i got from this place. It reminded me of an old traditional seafood restaurant you'd find on the east coast, but with an upscale feeling. It was simply amazing. I was also impressed with our waiter, he was very friendly and prompt. As for the food, we all got different dishes and tried each other. My absolute favorite was the macaroni and cheese with lobster. All i have to say is the cheesy lobster combination with the pasta was to die for! Among the other dishes, was calamari, shrimp, and catfish which all were pretty great as well. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who's in need of a quality seafood fix!",

The service was okay. Kids meals came out with the rest of the food but it took a while for drink refills. No big deal. Food looked very good when served. Here's the kicker.....  I became deathly ill about a week and a half after my birthday dinner. I'm talking- convulsing on the floor ill and then shitting my brains out while vomiting at the same time. I was like this for a solid week. Went to my doctor and had a lot of tests run. Spent another two weeks living feet away from the toilet because I couldn't stop crapping myself. Turns out Papadeux fed me tainted shrimp from China and I got Salmonella poisoning. I've got the report from the MCHD to prove it. Not only did I receive Salmonella from them but a lot of other people did to. I will NEVER go back nor recommend this place to anyone I know.",

    "text": "Came here with my daughter for my 45th birthday and I couldn't have been happier with my meal. We started with crab claws which had an amazing sauce. Personally, I don't think the rice on the plate with this app was necessary; a few extra claws would've been way better. My daughter ordered pasta with shrimp and scallops which she loved it. I had the salmon with shrimp and scallops over sauteed spinach. Both of our meals also had crab meat on top. My daughter had leftovers, I'm happy to say I did not! After dinner our server brought us the dessert tray which was on the house for birthdays. We had the banana pudding that came in a mason jar that we got to take home. Raised in Florida makes me picky about my seafood and although this place was a bit of a drive, I will go back for more than just a birthday dinner. Kudos for making great seafood in the middle of the desert!",

We ordered gumbo - which the flavor was a bit bland. Lots of shrimp and seafood, and the juicy andouille sausage. But the broth was lacking and super runny...  I was definitely a big fan of the Pasta Mardi Gras! HOLY MOLY!!! the cream sauce was delightful :) Abundant pieces of shrimp, sausage, scallops and crawfish! Swimming in that tasty cream and tomato sauce. The whole bowl of dish was accompanied by a buttery garlic crostini that was used to sop up all the leftover sauce. Can't stop talking about that sauce!  The servings of the dishes were huge and overwhelming - but i'm definitely not complaining. The service was overall good - the food came out in lighting speed.",

The only negative thing we had to say was about the fondu appetizer that comes with crawfish & shrimp.  We asked that it be served without the crawfish, only the shrimp.  When the menu said \"shrimp\" that is what we received was JUST ONE SHRIMP.  That was a rip-off.  One would think that if they are only.going to pi in one shrimp and one crawfish, they could have at least replaced the one crawfish with one shrimp.  So, be careful.

    "text": "First time at Pappadeaux. Arrived 10 mins early with reservations and waited 20 anyway. Hmm. Our server, Reno, arrive about 7 mins after that. He dropped off water and turned to leave but we had waited long enough to know we wanted the Oyster Duo for an app. He tried to leave again before we could order drinks. Not a good start.   Besides the app and two drinks, we got Filet Minion with Lobster Tail and the Atlantic Salmon Alexander. The bill came to $119.20 plus tip.   The oysters were good. Our favorites were the cheesy ones but the spinach-hollandaise oysters were good too - just too much spinach. Most of the food on the entrees was excellent. The fillet was seasoned perfectly, tender and juicy-just what my wife wanted. The lobster tail was huge, accompanied by a vat of butter and some big, tender asparagus. My salmon was cooked just right, with a crispy crust but was still moist and with great Cajun seasoning. The crawfish, scallops and shrimp were all good but the shrimp were small. The decadent sauce over all was rich and creamy. I didn't care for the dirty rice but I think it was due to flavors, not the way it was cooked. Just not my kind of rice dish.   Reno was okay as a server. He was new and didn't have a routine down yet but he was warm and engaging and he will be good if his managers will give him a chance to bloom.   We may go back to Pappadeaux again. The parking lot was cutthroat and the wait time for some was brutal. Perhaps we'll return in the summer when the snowbirds have left!",

Also, the corporate undertones are strong with this one. Good service on steroids is the best way to describe it. Hard to explain why that's a \"bad\" thing necessarily, but I think anyone who knows anything about the restaurant industry understands what I am saying.   The good: portions are generous and the food overall is great. Oysters and such are fresh, shucked well, and not watered down. The soft shell crab entree is bomb.

The first one I had was over-cooked and tasted like rubber (They claimed their steamer broke down) so they offered to replace it. They finally got the lobster in and called me and it was fine. I asked the Manager to order me one every 2 weeks.   Of course, I needed to chase him to order it and after waiting 3 - 4 weeks I called and left a message again. They finally called and told me to come in, as they received the lobster. I told them I would call back to set a time within the next 24 hours. I called and set an appointment for the next day at 11 am. When I arrived and they seated me, I explained, the manager had a 6 lb lobster waiting for me. After waiting about 10 minutes, a lady manager advised me they sold my 6 lb lobster last night to someone who allegedly said he had a lobster waiting for him. I traveled 30 minutes and took time out of my day and this was the best they could do. The General Manager never addressed it with me or offered a viable excuse, so I am finished with this place. Unfortunately, they have lost their way when it comes to quality food and excellent service.  If I treated my customers this way, I would not have a business. Disgusted.  Ron Sanders",

Be warned not EVERYTHING is flown in daily. Only one page of the menu is. My boyfriend and I shared frog legs, crab Mac n cheese and the Chilean sea bass. I will say the Mac n cheese was freaking delicious but I tasted very little crab. The frogs legs were the saddest of the 3. Just plain fried like the heap of French fries it comes with. No finesse or seasoning. A lot of their menu is just fried seafood. The sea bass was ok. I don't think they treated the fish amazingly and the toppings/accompaniments are lackluster. Overall nothing was really elevated or screamed fresh seafood. For the price and drive I will not be going back there. Check out little cleos for a much more exciting seafood experience.",

    "text": "Pappadeaux sure is the real deal! Which explains the big crowd of people waiting to be seated outside. This is an eclectic restaurant that is great for any type of gathering, from a romantic date with your significant other to a big blowout birthday celebration with friends and family.  We came on a busy Friday night with no reservation, so we were given a pager. We snagged seats at the bar and started off with drinks. They have a huge selection of their own alcoholic mixed beverages. Bartenders can sure make a mean cocktail!    If you don't mind the loud hustle and bustle, then there would be a shorter wait for an inside table. However, we loved the fun outdoor lighting and decor, so we didn't mind the extra wait. When our pager finally went off, our hostess immediately seated us at our table before a live band. I couldn't get over how charming the patio area was.   The food is AMAZEBALLS! Please keep in mind that the portions are LARGE, especially the appetizers.  My Loves:  Sea Bass and Shrimp - My favorite dish of the night. It must have been a special, as I don't see it on the menu. It was fresh and tasty and had lovely presentation.  Coconut Shrimp - Can't go wrong with this dish. Each bite sent me to food heaven. The marmalade sauce it came with complemented it perfectly. And the shrimp was huge!  Oysters - very large and fresh and muy delicioso  My Like:   Crispy Fried Alligators - Tasted kind of like chicken, but a little slimy. It tasted great with the Creolo sauce it came with. However, I thought it was a bit too oily and fried for me.   This was absolutely way too much food for two people. I highly suggest going with at least a group of 4. That way you can share and try a lot more items. Pappadeaux is definitely worth trying. I cannot wait for my next visit to Phoenix, so that I can feast here again.",

I gave it three stars bc I can't bring myself to rate a Pappa chain alongside Red Lobster. I have frequented (and I mean often) the Pappa chain in Dallas and Austin.  The AZ restaurant obviously has the same recipes bc the sauces are unforgettable but their portions, especially the crab cakes, are tiny. They do have the same mutant huge potatoes.    I was primarily disappointed with the service, mediocre at best where as, coming from TX, I was expecting the normal Pappa hospitality and bend over backwards to leave an impression - staff.  It was early evening and the sun was setting. I was literally told I could not move, nor could the blinds be lowered, despite being blinded by the sun in my face.   It's saddens me to have this restaurant tarnish an amazing name. Save your money bc you have the same steep prices but not half the experience!  Btw Pappadeaux in TX was my favorite restaurant - Austin and Dallas, I assumed they were all that good!",

Very pricey... even for simpler meals of chicken and noodles. If money isn't an issue, then definitely go. It was more of an experience then anything else. But a good, memorable experience. :)",

This is a great place to take a date, but some of the seating is just awful. Who wants to sit near the entrance or on the edge of a hall with people constantly walking by and bumping your chair? Kind of annoying... especially when the place is empty and there are far better seats.  The little things are what get you 5 stars.",

From the moment you walk in you can sense the magical ambiance, and the staff is warm and welcoming and quick to address any needs.  Our favorite dish is the lobster tail and filet mignon (the best of surf and turf), but we've had almost everything by now and it is all amazing, fresh, and spiced to perfection.  Every dessert is fantastic if you manage to have any room left but I will say I've never tasted better creme brulee.  The food is a little pricey so we do reserve dinner here for special occasions, but I have enjoyed every meal here so much that I would gladly pay more everywhere for this kind of quality and attention to detail!  Also, the restaurant is pretty busy during dinner hours so reservations are always recommended.  I would absolutely recommend making your next dinner plans here immediately!",

Unfortunately, that is not the only reason to pay high prices at a restaurant. Ambience and service are also a big part of a pleasant dining experience.  By the time we left the restaurant, one person in our group had a headache from all the noise. The staff was not especially friendly and all appeared to be running - adding to the frenzied atmosphere. It is clear from the crowds at this restaurant that this review won't mean much to the company. We really want to love this place, but it was our last visit. We will frequent restaurants where we don't feel rushed and we can carry on a private conversation without having to talk over the noise.",

    "text": "This place is d'lish for seafood in the desert !  My boyfriend and I have been twice in the past few years because it is pretty far on the west side for us.  But it is well worth it when we are craving some crawfish or crabcakes!  It's easy to pass by if you haven't been because it is along side the highway shortly after you pass Bobby-Q's.  The front entrance is very pretty with the vines, fountain and greenery.  It's nice to see this in the desert...it cools things down drastically !  The bar inside is great and every time I've been it's always been packed but chairs open up pretty quickly.  The bartenders are great and always happy to tweak drinks (I got the mango margarita and added strawberry puree). :)  They had oysters flying outta that bar like ninjas!!  I wished that I liked them because it's part of what everyone loves about this place.  Just can't get past that texture....yeesh.   When we sat we were in the back room that if this restaurant was on the water we would be hanging right over it....I wish.  Our waiter came back who was VERY stressed out - he stressed US out !  Wiping the sweat from his face, hands shaking, running back and fourth.  It's a good thing they have food runners who help out because I'm not sure we could have handled that all evening.  Now, onto the good stuff....  We ordered a small bowl of Seafood Gumbo to share and try as well as the Fried Calamari.  The Seafood Gumbo was delicious with a little bit of spice to it, lumps of seafood which I'm pretty sure is what gave the yummy broth it's good flavor! Calamari was crispy and good.....not as good as Salt Cellar, but good. :)  For dinner we split the Seafood Platter which they split up for us before it got to our table.  It had.....EVERYTHING.  Crawfish, crabcakes, stuffed shrimp, oysters, etc.  It was a MASSIVE portion so do not order this on your own unless you can gorge yourself into a coma.  I don't recommend it because they have a lot of desserts to chose from.    On that note, we ordered the creme brulee.  Good....lawd.  It was amazing.  the inside was super creamy and perfect. Top was crispy as expected with a side of strawberries and raspberries.  I was very happy with our choice on desert!",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The seafood is very fresh, I'm not quite sure how they do that. The crab cakes are to die for. They put crawfish in them and the sauce is d'lish. I love the plank salmon too, but I recently discovered the pasta mardi gras (seafood pasta). I'm usually not a fan of seafood pastas because they taste so fishy, but this was really good. I've never had anything less than great here and each time I go I try something new.  The drinks are good, but the speciality drinks are pretty weak. If you want a good strong drink, order a mixer. On the weekends they usually have live music on the patio, which is usually jazz or blues. It makes waiting for a table all the easier for sure. They do take reservations though, so if you don't want to wait an hour, call ahead.  If you go all out on the meal (appetizer, drinks, and dessert), for two people, you can expect it will easily be over $100. Worth it! Though we usually save it for special occasions.",

    "text": "*3.5 stars*  My hunny loves this place, so we went for his birthday last Friday. I'm glad I made reservations because the restaurant was packed (like sardines *har har*) when we arrived at 6:30 pm. It was VERY LOUD inside...This is NOT a good place for a first date because my husband and I were practically yelling and we still could barely hear each other. The 4-man N'awlins band playing was complimentary to the atmosphere, but the music just added to the din. Phil was our waiter and he was friendly and personable.  We started with soup...hubs enjoyed his shrimp gumbo, although he and I thought my cup of lobster bisque was better (my mouth is watering as I'm typing this!) The french bread that came out before the meal was standard and nothing special. My entree was filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I also added king crab legs which my sweetie and I shared. The filet was cooked right, but didn't have much flavor...had to ask for A-1 (gasp!) The asparagus were downright delicious and the taters were yummy too. Crab legs were fresh and tasty. I liked the tealight our server brought to the table to melt the butter for my crab because it kept the butter melted throughout dinner. My husband got mahi mahi with etouffee on top (came with dirty rice) and he was transported to food heaven.  I had a weird experience when I excused myself to go to the restroom. After admiring my hair, a woman (that I had never met) told me she was a spiritualist, said she saw lots of tension around me, and saw lots of change in my future. All I saw was the crab shell that had lodged itself in my eye when I had attempted to crack it. Along with the tears running down my cheek because of said crab shell. Bet you can imagine how annoying it was to be accosted in the bathroom...and it was......but I just can't be rude to someone who says I have pretty hair. Even if she was a wacka-doo.  Next time we go to Pappadeaux's I'm going to avoid the crab and the ladies restroom.......  Just kidding.  I'll still get the crab.",

The wait was fairly short, we got drinks at the bar while we waited and the bartender was very friendly and fast!

Everyone was helping each other and looking out for one another. Our waitress Hannah was amazing, she was so sweet and so kind and very efficient. We had some appetizers then orders the crusted Atlantic salmon. When we got our meal it was cold. We told our waitress and she immediately apologized and offered to bring us another meal ..... We decided to just get dessert instead. She boxed up our cold meal since they were just going to throw it away. Shortly after the manager came over I think her name was Kaylee she apologized for the situation and offered to comp our dessert. When we got our bill she took care of the whole thing..... We were completely shocked! We left our waitress a nice tip and thanked the manager .... We will definitely revisit!",

I like that this place is a made-from-scratch restaurant and you can customize your food.  I also love that they sell Vietti Moscato.  A good moscato is very hard to find at restaurants for some reason, and this is a really good one.  They even put fresh raspberries in it!  Would come back again and again if I lived in Phoenix.

    "text": "Thank you, Pappadeaux, for giving us landlocked Phoenicians a nice seafood place that doesn't break the bank.  The relatives from up north were coming to town and the request was for those classicly native Phoenician foods, lobster and crab legs.  There were going to be 8 of us, and I was getting ready to take out the $1,000 bank loan when Yelp pointed me to Pappadeaux.   Thank goodness they take reservations for 8 or more.  I'm all over it.  Turns out it was crawdad night (crawfish for you cultured Creoles), and the place was an absolute madhouse.  We lucked out finding a parking spot and slowly made our way through the crush of people waiting outside.  I lost my entire party in the crowd and by the time I made it to the hostess desk was sure our reservation was a goner.  But the disheveled hostess, who probably suffers from PTSD after that night, said we were good.  whew.  I sent a rescue crew to retrieve my lost troops.  It was incredibly noisy so we had to do some strategic table placement for the hard of hearing.  The service was impeccable.  Demands for substitutions, butter sent back because it was too salty, help needed for seafood haters - our waiter fielded them all calmly and accommodated even the pickiest requests.   Everyone loved their food, which really was very good.  I got my favorite banana pudding - who needs an entree, really.  The bill was reasonable and everyone was happy.  Another mission accomplished, another bullet dodged.",

I will never go to red lobster again it's McDonalds compared to pappadeaux!! The staff is friendly and always knows the menu so well. The Pappas salad is fresh and tossed right in front of you. I dream about their filet and lobster plate!! I've found my favorite seafood restaurant!!",

I went on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and there was no waiting.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  I ordered the blackened catfish covered with shrimp and crab in a cream/creole sauce.  It could have been a bit more blackened and spicy.  The house salad was good and the gumbo was excellent...just spicy enough for a good kick.  They serve a full loaf of French bread with warm, whipped butter.  There could have been more beer selections.  I may go every night while I'm in town here for 3 days.  MMMMMmmmmm.....GOOD!!",

The waiter was very nice and helpful, I got seated right away without waiting, it's weekend, so the restaurant was very crowded. I ordered a crawfish platter, which I have been missing for quite a long time and Pappadeaux seems the first decent seafood restaurant I found that serve crawfish.  Both the service and the food were excellent.  I just feel the sauce was a bit spicy for me, should have told waiter to make it less spicy.  I also like the environment outside the restaurant, very pretty view~   I would definitely go back and try some more dishes if I am in Phoenix area next time and feel ok with long drive.",

Leaving money on the table and the customer unhappy!   The food was fabulous every item was perfectly prepared. I am happy to spend money on food but $9.95 for 1 crab cake appetizer that is SMALLER than a hockey puck means I will be spending my $184.50 for 3 people at a much better restaurant. The cost for the quality is why this is NOT a 5 star review.  Food 10 stars value 2 stars.  I have had much better food for much lower price and much less waiting.  I'm sad.

When I first checked in I was told it was a 45 minuet wait time by the hostess and that was fine since it was a Saturday night and I expected a wait. After about an hour I went to ask how much longer it would be and the hostess was kind enough to tell me it had only been 58 minuets and she said it was going to be an hour so we needed to step back and continue to wait. I told her she said it would be 45 minuets when we checked in and she told me she would have never told me 45 minuets and we had only been waiting 58 minuets so she would get to us when there was a table open and there was 3 parties ahead of us. I stepped out of the way and they called up the first party they were seating. I didn't want to go far if they were going to call us soon. They called up and sat 4 more parties in the the next 15 or so minuets I was standing there. By that time my girlfriend was getting visibly upset, so thank goodness they seated us right after that. In the end it wasn't the long wait, I get that it was a Saturday evening and very busy, it was the hostess that had to be so condescending telling me we had only been waiting for 58 minuets, not a full 60, and implying to me that I was either wrong/lying/or I didn't listen to her say 45 minuets when I checked in. In all honesty the food was great and the desserts were amazing. We even ordered extra desserts so we could give the babysitter one. It's definitely on the higher end of mid range restaurants but well worth it if you love sea food. Also I recommend just ordering a few appetizers if it's just you and a date because the portions are really big. I really wanted to give more stars.",

THIS was definitely a much better experience.  We got here a little after 8 pm, a bit early for our 8:30 pm reservations. They had our table ready and whenever we were ready to go. They were uber accommodating - even when our party of 10 became a party of 8.  Brook was our server. AWESOME MAN. Fantastic suggestions, substitution, and all over awesomeness. Wished I lived closer to have this place all the time.  Wine cellar for our private party. You should ask - it fits about 10-12 people comfortably.   What we ordered- * Mississippi Catfish Opelousas - Blackened catfish with shrimp, oysters  & jumbo lump crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice ... It was so light, so flavorful. OH my. I totally understand why my friend LOVES this dish. $29.99 *Atlantic Salmon Yvette (11 oz. 26.95 .. 7 oz. 22.95) Char-grilled salmon with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms & spinach, in a sherry white wine sauce, with dirty rice. * Pappadeaux sampler - Fried fish filets (choice of catfish, tilapia or both), shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with extra fried shrimp & crawfish)... the extra is what separates the seafood platter vs pappadeaux sampler. ($32.99) *Oyster sampler appetizer - with both of their baked oysters (Oysters Pappadeaux - Baked oysters on the half shell with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise and Oysters Baton Rouge - Oysters on the half shell baked with a Parmesan Romano cheese sauce) - $13.95, with three of each oyster. *Appetizer Trio - Mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux, fried alligator & hot smoked salmon* (we switched the salmon for Coconut shrimp) OH nom nom nom. This was one fantastic appetizer - can be shared or ordered as an entree - $22.99  Somewhat disappointed in their section of raw oysters - Gulf Coast and Blue point only.  Lobster tank in front, with their prices per pound.   Will definitely come back especially now i know what I ordered. Pretty pricey, but totally worth the flavors and food. OH nom nom nom indeed",

First, the food is great and I am obsessed with the shrimp and crawfish fondue. I have literally come to Pappdeaux and ordered that as my meal! But what really pushed me to do this review was our waitress Jada. I would come in and wait just to sit in her section! She knew the menu, answered our questions fast, my drink never dipped below half full, she was just fun to talk to, and always had a smile! This girl really made the experience just a bit more fun and personal. I'm all about customer service and she was just off the charts.",

I really love the iPhone app, I sorted my bookmarks and Pappadeux was the closest.  My husband ordered a chicken pasta dish (not in the mood for seafood), our friend a Cajun combo plate and for me the fried crawfish/etoufee.  Everyone enjoyed their food, our friends really liked the dirty rice. My dish was absolutely delicious, the etoufee sauce was smoky/spicy and very flavorful and I as well loved the dirty rice The fried crawfish was ok, nothing special. The loaf of bread before dinner was warm and crispy, very good. The kids menu didn't had much for my 17 mo/old son,most  everything was fried  (he doesn't  like fried food much...I know, he didn't got that from me;) but he filled up on bread and the crackers they had at the table. The waiter was very nice and prompt, although it took a while for our food to come out.  We have friends from New Orleans who are great cooks and they enjoyed the food here as well.  I'll definitely will come back for the dirty rice and crawfish etoufee.",

Lucky to be seated away from the bar area to avoid the noise.  Very accommodating as asked to be seated at a bit larger table that was available.  There was a number in our group.  I'm more about the food and could care less about the settings, not so here.  From the minute you are in the parking lot you feel like you are mentally taken away and transported to somewhere else.  Never been to New Orleans but, the other guest said it was very nice.  So, from the minute you get out of your car take the time to look around. Enjoy the settings from your car and including up to your table.  Glad to be seated away from the bar area noise.  The inside was nice as the lighting was just right as not to be to dark or to light.  I like to see what I'm eating and enjoy it, perfect lighting. Staff was helpful and nice.  We all got the Pappadeax Platter. We were told it is a lot of food and I thought, ya sure I'll see.  It was and had some to go home and I'm ok with that!  Enjoy it a bit longer.  The food was very good and was fresh, even the next day ... what I took home.  We all were to full for any desert and then saw some of deserts pass by to the next table, we're drooling at the site.  Just to full so, we plan on going back before dinner crowd just for desert. For a special night out it is a winner.  It is a relax place without the stuffy attitude that some places have.",

    "text": "Pappadeaux has been one of my family's favorite seafood restaurants in Phoenix for several years......until today!  We just went for dinner fairly early to beat the Friday rush.  We ordered our drinks and appetizer, approximately 15 minutes later my beer showed up after I had to ask the waiter for it again.  That was the first disappointment but was actually the least disappointing!  We ordered our food and were patiently waiting, we understand that the food does not arrive immediately.  20 minutes went by...then 30.  After about 40 minutes the waiter came out and let us know that he was sorry it was taking so long and that our food was coming right out.  After this extremely long wait our 22 month old son was at the end of his rope and was out of patience.  We told them that we had to have the food to go since it had been so long.  The manager came out and apologized to us and offered us either a free desert or a gift certificate ($7 desert or $50 gift certificate...don't take the desert!).  We do appreciate the gift certificate, however the disappointment was not over.  We got home to eat the food (travel time only about 15 minutes).  My fried oysters were cold and soggy, I assume they had been sitting on the counter for quite awhile before they packaged them up for us.  My son's kids shrimp meal ended up being only 4 shrimp in the box with no fries!  My wife was also not very happy with her fish, very bland and not satisfying.  We are very disappointed that Pappadeaux's has sunk to this level, we used to love it in the past but will not be eating there again.  To whoever we end up giving the gift certificate to.....sorry!",

My hubby and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary Saturday night and after asking friends where we should go, most suggested Pappadeaux. Of course when I called for reservations, the time I wanted was fully booked. However the hostess suggested I call 15 minutes before getting there to be put on the wait list (which was a 30 min wait)... Did what she suggested and after checking in, getting the pager, only had to wait another 5 mins! Driving almost 30 mins to get there ... This was awesome! LOL  We had two waiters (I think one was training or was paired with our main waiter) were wonderful. The one who greeted us, took our drink orders cleared our plates after each course and filled our water glasses was so welcoming. (I have to say, while we were being seated, we crossed paths with a few wait staff and all said \" welcome to Pappadeaux\".)  Our main waiter, Sam, was THE BEST. I asked him what he liked and he recommended the Mahi Alexander... Which I ordered!  My husband ordered the filet and lobster combo. Everything was cooked to perfection. The steak was so tender, the lobster was so buttery and tasty and my Mahi Mahi was paired perfectly with the dirty rice and the creamy crawfish.  YUMMMMMY!!!!  Of course, we couldn't finish everything ... Oh, and the baked oysters were soooo good! We ordered the Oyster Duo for our appetizer ... We also order the banana bread pudding for dessert... Also good! Our girl waiter took our dessert order and asked if we were celebrating anything special and after telling her it was our anniversary, our dessert came with a note written in strawberry jam \"happy 18th wedding anniversary\" Couldn't finish it all either but was able to take it home in the mason jar it came in. :)   What a great impression this place gave us! From the gorgeous courtyard with the fountain and live band outside, to the well trained wait staff (BRAVO TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER!) and of course to the EXCELLENT food! We will definitely be coming here again ... And not just for special occasions.",

I took a good look over the rest of the yelp reviews to see if anyone else said anything about the temp of the food. Nobody has said anything, which really surprises me! Do people like food that is not hot? The last visit I made to Pappadeux I really wanted to ENJOY my meal without having to return it to be \"nuked\" so I told the waiter of my issues and he looked at me like I was crazy - I AM NOT CRAZY!!! Hahah I swear my food is just not hot enough, and it's not like I want it to burn my mouth off I just don't want it to be - warm! That is not SUFFICIENT. Hot meal please, yes thank you! I pay good money, I want hot soup. I want HOT seafood not WARM. The waiter said something about how they need to cook it at a certain temp...um yes I know how to cook seafood that doesn't mean it's served warm.... along with everything else on the dish that is NOT seafood. Nice try. So I guess I have sort of a love/hate relationship with this place. If they would just serve it hot the first time, I would be in heaven.. /end rant.",

Their oysters are awesome (just hint..don't be swayed by the more expensive oysters..not worth it and they are smaller.  Texas gulf oysters are delicious).  This place can get expensive, but the portions are huge and splitting is recommended.  The raw bar is very very reasonable and it's where I tend to hang out.  Bakers dozen of oysters and one of their sublime Bloody Mary's is a perfect combo.  Usually get their mozzarella sticks too which are light and crunchy with a very good marinara sauce.  Salads are yummy.  I tend not to order off the menu as the appetizers are filling enough, but I have had their fish, although I don't Cajun anything..if it's a good piece of fish and cooked right, you don't need to pepper it up.  Seafood brochette over dirty rice is one of my favorites and always tons left over for like a dinner and a lunch.  Best seafood place in the valley..hands down.  Oh..and the waitstaff is top notch.",

Recently my husband and I decided to go there for lunch for our anniversary and were disgusted by the negative experience we had there. The place looks more like a cheap Vegas cafeteria now, the carpet is filthy, the silverware was dirty and the service was horrible! Our waitress seated us directly next to the only other people in the place which was ridiculous since the entire restaurant was wide open. The waiter waiting on that table was bringing them bread and going over the menu with them, ours did none of those things. We ordered the fried alligator appetizer which was over seasoned and chewy and when our lunch came it was clear that the catfish my husband ordered had come straight from a bag of frozen fish. The fact that the sauce and butter are served in paper cups at $20 a plate was unreal. The food was cafeteria quality at best my food was inedible. The waitress was rude so I finally asked for the manager who came over made excuses and finally comped the meal. It was a complete waste of time and we both left hungry. I don't know what happened to that place but it has become a terrible restaurant and we will NEVER go back!",

We actually saw a guy steal a spot and then just about get into a fist fight over it, THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR CARS PEOPLE!  FYI, with a little patience we found a great spot close to the enterance.    For a chain....this place is AWESOME!  First of all the garden and fountains had me 100% even if the food had sucked (which it didnt).  Live music and cocktails while sitting in lush foliage with the sound of running water and the beauty of sparkling light made the 2 hour wait worth it (it was friday night, I've been told its not that bad on other days).  You pretty much HAVE to try the Spamp Thing cocktail....its the strongest bomb pop you'll ever drink.   We also sampled a strawberry peach cooler and a 'catagory 5', also fantastic.    Our server was great.  Charles Chester  was double sat but did an awesome job of making us feel as though we were his only table.  The general atmospher is very southern bayou with dim lighting and gas lamps, pretty unique for phoenix even if it might be considered cliche.  And listen here ladies, that flickering gas light does WONDERS for the complextion!     Alligator bites, eh....but the Lousiana Talipia I had served with green beans and spagetti squash was SOOOOOO GOOOODDD!  Plus I added a garden salad (which was huge....I actually ate very little of my meal due to this) for 2.95.  Where do you see THAT price anymore??  My dinner partners enjoyed a blackened talipia with dirty rice, fried catfish with fries, and a steak with mash potatoes and brocoli.  There was not a single complaint at our table!    Dessert was great.  Pappadeaux has those cheesy 80's dessert trays where everything has a coat of acrylic to keep it looking fresh....I LOVE those corny presentation trays!  FYI Pappadeaux has maybe 15 options for dessert?  Pretty impressive.  As a first time visitor we were offered a dessert on the house (WOW) and choose a chocolate brownie turtle thingie which was served warm w some yumm-o vanilla ice cream.  The single slice was HUGE, even shared between the 4 of us we hardly finished it.  Somehow we were able to force it down :)    For the price i thought the meal was a good value with plenty of fresh options.  The only think I'm dissappointed about is that Pappadeaux is not actually locally owned, although it is family owned.  It doesnt feel chain-y but I still try to avoid them as much as possible.",

To find this gem of a restaurant in the middle of the southwest desert is truly amazing.",

When I was visiting Phoenix and passed this on the freeway I knew where I was going for dinner. A friend recommended the red fish, along with my server, and that's what I got. My friend and I ordered drinks which were ok, and coconut shrimp appetizer while waited for our food. They were yummy jumbo shrimp. It came with 5 and a sweet dipping sauce. Even tho I had to send my fish back, the manager and server were so kind and accommodating. The manager comped my meal and included a desert. It was such a wonderful atmosphere and meal, plays great service, I'm looking to trying one the next time I'm in the South.",

The courtyard with the fountain I would have remembered. When we got inside I was certain I had never set foot inside. Has a Louisiana seafood feeling. I was impressed with the interior. Not super expensive high end but really nice.  Unfortunately I'm doing keto now and doing my best to stay on track. I have been craving grilled shrimp Ceasar salads. I got thier Ceasar, and added extra shrimp.  This was the best Ceasar salad I've ever had. Being as good as it was I don't want to know how many carbs were in the dressing. Don't tell me. That dressing is Awesome!  I wish I had got a picture of it. I will be back. We live in the city of Maricopa and I will drive the distance for good seafood.",

    "text": "3.5 years in the Phoenix area, and I had never been to Pappadeaux.  WTF was I thinking?  Seriously!  WTF?  I would soon find out that I was missing out....big time!  My buddy was out for Spring Training, and I had decided that we would finally try this place out.  We arrived around 11:30am and were seated at a table right away.  We ordered our drinks and some appetizers (alligator, and boudin) , then browsed the menu for a bit.  I had an idea of what I was going to get, but there were SO MANY delicious sounding items, it was hard to pick.  I made up my mind though and placed my order for the lunch sized portion of the crawfish combination.  While waiting for our food, our waitress delivered a loaf of French bread and some butter.  Here is how everything was...............  Alligator-  I had only had alligator once before (Dragos in New Orleans), and thought it was delicious.  Somewhat of a chicken texture, but a tad more chewy.  When we went to order the alligator appetizer, our waitress informed us that there was an option for it to be grilled, also (the menu only offers the fried option).  We decided to go with a large order and went half grilled, half fried.  It was a damn fine recommendation by our waitress.  The fried portion was crispy and chewy and had great flavor.  The star of the show though, was the grilled!  It was blackened in a great seasoning, and had great texture.  It comes with some \"alligator sauce\", and a few dips into that, put my mouth in heaven!  Both my buddy and I liked the grilled a little more than the fried.  Both choices were freaking delicious though!  Can't go wrong with either option!  Boudin- Boudin is a Cajun sausage stuffed with a dirty rice type mixture.  This appetizer came with 2 links on top of a pile of rice.  The casings that they use and pretty strong and somewhat hard to cut.  I pretty much split mine down the middle and just ate the \"guts\" of the sausage.  It definitely had a different texture/taste.  Reminded me of a \"white hot\", almost.  It was tasty, but not sure if I would crave it or get it again.    Crawfish Combination-  This was my entree, and it was damn tasty!  This mountain of a plate came with a massive pile of dirty rice topped with crawfish etouffee, and a massive pile of fried crawfish.  This entree should be split by 2 people.  One man should not try to tackle this thing on its own.  And this was a \"lunch\" portion.  Can't even imagine how big the \"dinner\" portion is.  The fried crawfish were breaded and seasoned perfectly!  I kept popping nugget, after nugget into my mouth and could not stop eating them!  The etouffee part of the entree was delicious as well!  It was a thick gravy filled with tons of pieces of crawfish, layered over dirty rice.  I am not the biggest rice fan, but this rice was awesome!  I ate until I could not eat anymore, and there was still about half of the etouffee left.  Got it boxed up and gave it to a homeless lady on our drive home.  My buddy went with the Cajun Combo (catfish and shrimp Creole).  He let me try some of his blackened catfish (biggest filet of catfish I have ever seen!) and it was delicious!  The shrimp creole was a bit skimp though.  It was mainly veggies and very few shrimp.  Total opposite of my crawfish etouffee (overflowing with crawfish).  After we gorged ourselves silly, we still went with some dessert.  My buddy loves key lime pie, so we went with a slice of that.  Holy hell!  Delicious!  HUGE piece of key lime pie.  Great graham cracker crust, perfectly chilled filling and it was topped with berries and puree etc.  It was a great piece of pie!  (It was comped off the bill, too.  Read other reviews of people getting a free dessert if it is your first time dining here...not sure if that is True or not, but it makes sense.  And, that is freaking awesome if that is why!)  Overall, it was a great lunch!  Pricey, yes, but that french bread, alligator, boudin, crawfish combination and key lime pie were all fantastic!  Pair that with great service, great company, and an awesome setting (the restaurant is beautiful!), it justifies the price, somewhat.  Can't eat here every day, but for special occasions or a few times a year, this may be my new \"go to spot\" in Phoenix.  It wasn't just the best meal of the weekend, it may have been one of the best meals I have had since being in Phoenix!  It was awesome and I can't wait to go back!",

For that price, I was expecting either phenomenal quality and flavor, or a huge quantity. I got neither. I would have expected to pay $18-20 for that meal, not almost $30.  We had a table of 7, and waited over 40 mins for our meals to be served after ordering. Later, it was mentioned to us in passing that the food took forever because someone ordered a half chicken which takes a long time. The server should have warned us when that person ordered that dish, or at the very least should have come back to the table to check on us in that looooooong amount of time that we were waiting.   Overall, the quality of food was good, but not excellent. However we felt it was extremely overpriced for the quality/quantity, and the dining experience was poor because we had to wait so long.",

We ordered several appetizers and shared. Lobster bisque, alligator, crab cakes, shrimp and crab cocktail, gumbo, salad... everything was delicious!!!

The wait wasn't too long (we called ahead), but we wanted drinks while we waited. The bar was very busy!! Didn't happen. Lots of servers walking by us, why not serve drinks to people who are waiting? They'd make so much monSo we got seated but it took the server another 10 min to get to us. We placed our drink orders but the drinks took 15 min. Our app arrived before them! We ordered and the food arrived after about 20 min. The prices have gone up a lot but unfortunately the quality of our food was low. It wasn't even close to the quality as before. I don't even want to eat my leftovers. I had the Pasta Mardi Gras... it tasted like dirt. Literally. My husband didn't even enjoy his bacon-wrapped shrimp. The quality just wasn't there.   Pros: calamari was good Cons: very slow service, low quality on pretty expensive food  I really hope management reads these and makes changes. I'd like to go back but I will never drop another $150 at that place if it continues to be what it was last night.  UPDATE Management contacted us via Yelp and sent us a gift card to try again. They said this locations manager will be made aware of our complaints. It's nice that they cared and did this  another update Went last night for my cousins birthday. Everything was great just like we have experienced in years past. Excellent, efficient service and great food (worth the price this time). Haven't used the gift card yet, but last nights visit helped us want to try again.",

We thought we would have trouble getting a table but they got us in right away.   Our lovely servers name was Brianna (liking that girls name)! Anyway, I got the crab mac and cheese.  ehhhhhh.... it wasn't that great. There was little to no crab and it just tasted normal. I won't complain too much cause I really do love macaroni and cheese.  The service was nice just like before but the food isn't really doing it for me.  I know i'll be back lol so I'll write another review on something else next time.  just ok",

    "text": "The server and staff was very accommodating and attentive. This is my third try as I have not wanted to wait an hour just to eat here. So it's after lunch hour and the crowd is gone, the pace slow and relaxing. I'm looking forward to a great experience and delicious food!   For appetizers it was lump crab and spinach, it was tasty but no crab flavor, then I got a side of gumbo. Gumbo as I remembered it living in Louisiana and how I learned to make it was usually in a thick broth, what I got was basically a wet salty soup, so salty I stopped after the first spoonful.   Moving on, my main course arrived, I ordered the lunch combo of blacken catfish on a bed of dirty rice and shrimp (4 pieces) creole over white rice. Again it was so salty I could not eat the catfish, my white rice along with anything supposing to resemble a vegetable was soggy. I ate 10% of what I ordered, the rest was thrown away.   Perhaps this is the after lunch crowd quality of left over or watered down food, I'm not sure. What I am sure of, is that I will not return for the quality of food for the price point was not present. I would not return there even if they offered me my next meal at no charge.  Also surprising my server did not question the amount of food left on the plates, especially after I mentioned how salty the food was. I should have requested a refund, the other party with me also complained of the food and stopped eating citing an upset stomach. I suppose if I had an adult beverage I may have tolerated the feasting of the horrible food... good thing I do not drink.",

I consider myself a pretty reasonable person, but I was upset to say the least when we weren't offered any compensation or at least dessert even after telling him it was our anniversary. Staff just seemed frazzled and confused on the patio. Luckily the manager was super nice and understanding and refunded the platter after I spoke to her, but the whole experience literally left a bad taste in my mouth.",

Love their reservation process...you get a text confirming and also another one as a reminder the day of.   We arrived starving!  We were promptly seated and the ordering began.  My meal started with the Lump Crab Artichoke Dip.  It was very delicious.  However, I have to note that it did not taste like it had any crab in it.  No 'lumps' of crab whatsoever, not even a seafood flavor to it.  Still trying to figure that one out.  Did I say anything?  No, because it was a very delicious dip.  But I have to admit that at $17 I was disappointed there clearly was no Crab in it. After the appetizers we were brought warm bread and butter that was amazing, as well as salads and soups for those that ordered them.  My entree was the Mahi Alexander, per our server's recommendation.  Wow!  It was delicious.  I ordered the smaller portion and it was more than enough, I ended up with leftovers-yay!   Our service was great.  We were not offered dessert...just brought our checks (which were wrong and had to be corrected).  If it weren't for those 2 little things I would probably have given 5 stars.  We paid before one in our party realized we weren't offered dessert and she wasn't too happy about it.  I personally was way too stuffed! For me personally, I am an ambiance girl and I don't feel this is the right ambiance for a date night.  But it also was a little difficult with a large group because it is SO loud.  I would much prefer to sit on the adorable and very NOLA patio.  But being a December night it was much too chilly! I'd like to return in the spring and sit outside where it's quieter.   All in all, I was pleased and will return.",

I have been craving it ever since!   This review is for anyone that doesn't like seafood! Although most seafood spots don't have very good non seafood options, that is not the case for Pappadeaux!

    "text": "Mixed experience.  Came in on a Friday around 730.  The place was pretty busy.  Tried to make reservations over the phone earlier but were told no reservations were available.  Walked in and the hostess said 30 minutes.  Went to use the rest room and the place looked 30% empty.  Walked back out and 5 minutes later were told the table was ready.  Kind of a shaky start.  Our waitress Nancy was extremely helpful and friendly.  She went over all the specials and the whole background of Pappadeaux.  We ordered several items to share.  Calamari cajun style, crab legs, Texas redfish, and Mississippi catfish.  We waited for our food and no bread was served.  We literally ate some of the crackers on the table.  Drinks were also very slow to come out.  We received the calamari and it was okay.  Kind of small for the price and could have used more cajun spice.  Our food finally comes out after quite a wait.  The large order of crab legs consisted of about 4 legs.  We asked for them to be cut in the back and there were a couple small slits on the legs instead of them actually being cut down the middle.  We expected much more from a restaurant that accounts for 1% of the entire seafood consumed in the U.S and charged $55 bucks for 4 legs.  The Texas redfish was ridiculously flavorful.  The brown butter and wine sauce just danced all over my taste buds.  The fish was fresh, buttery, and everything went perfectly with dirty rice.  Every bite was absolutely delicious.    The Mississippi catfish was quite dull in flavor after the Texas redfish.  It was severely lacking flavor and freshness.  We really regretted this choice.  For dessert we ordered a banana pudding to go.  It was okay.  Nothing special to really say about it.  Our bill came out to $240+.  Probably won't be back for quantity/quality vs price ratio was too much in favor of the house.  If by chance I do happen to come back I am definitely ordering the Texas redfish!",

We had the crispy alligator for an appetizer with the provide sauce, it was fantastic! My wife and I shared the SHRIMP, SCALLOP & SPANISH OCTOPUS PAPPARDELLE PASTA, I know a mouth full but every single item on that plate tasted absolutely delicious! The grilled octopus was the best not tough like most octopus we tried in the past but very tender just terrific! We also shared some raw oysters, very fresh and of a good size. We usually don't get dessert but since we were sharing our meals, I decide to order the pecan cheesecake. After we tried it we were more than surprise how well it turn out, very creamy. My wife is a tougher critic with desserts but she had nothing but good things to say. Overall we came here to try out some seafood with low expectations since we lived in San Diego and gone to places like Hawaii, tried amazing seafood from Roy's restaurant so we already had the bar set quite high for our palate. This place truly is a contender with other fine seafood restaurants.",

My dad got the fettuccine pasta it had that hot sausage, shrimp and crawfish. I can't say enough about this place and the server Wyatt was the best server. He sings and he has the best personality. Make sure you tip him very well because he is worth every dollar. His singing voice (even with a cold) was great. Whenever I am on Phoenix I will be stopping here. It is well worth the money.",

I was here for a business meeting and the manager came by the table to confirm with my partner on the ingredients in a soup that he had ordered to avoid any food allergies. The service is pretty good here but on this particular day I was really blown away. They have gotten better over the years with changing their menu, and providing the best service. They really left a lasting impression on my client as well as myself",

I definitely recommended though because it has some of the best seafood in Phoenix.",

I'm a bit wary of any seafood I get in the Valley because it obviously has to be flown or trucked into the desert.   Pappadeaux's was recommended to me before I even arrived in Phoenix. The moving company driver told me about this place when he was loading my belongings on his 18-wheeler in North Carolina. I found the place on Yelp, showed him the picture, and he said, \"Yep! That's it!\" I bookmarked it in the app to check out.   I've been here a couple times already, but for some reason hadn't reviewed it yet. I most recently came with a friend for his company dinner (dinner on the boss! yay!). I had lobster, shrimp, oysters (fried and on the half-shell), calamari, and something else I can't even remember. The food has always been great. They have some pretty good salads and other items on the menu if you're not into seafood (my friend isn't, so that came in handy).    Love this place -- will definitely come back!",

Sadly, it only came with a few bite size lobster and couple shrimps. Clam chowder was good, but bit on the salty side.  We were given free toasted bread with butter. Bread was delicious! The place has a beautiful outdoor patio and our waiter Blake was excellent.   They also had a secret crawfish plate that was done upon request. Best crawfish I ever eaten. Extremely fresh. Try that out next time if you're a fan of crawfish.   Other than the high prices, this place was good.",

This time around this location knocked me off my feet with the quality of food and service for their carry out orders. While in phoenix to celebrate my friends wedding. I didn't have enough time to dine in so i opted to carry against my usual notions that carry outs are never as good as dining in. Well, I would like to thank papadeuaxs for changing my mind because my carry out meal was phenomenal. It was just as fresh and delicious as if i would have dined in. The portion size and quality was not skimmed on. The food was still hot when I made it back to my fathers home which was about 30 minutes away from this location.  You can tell that this location puts pride into every dish they serve out their kitchen!",

Appetizer came before the drinks and shortly after manager came by and explained that they had to change out the CO2 and it would be a few minutes. Entrees came before drinks and when drinks finally came we said we didn't want them. When server came back to check and apologize for the late drinks I told her 25 minutes was unacceptable. She was very rude saying she was busy.  Manager came later, we told her what happened and to our surprise she bought our lunch. In addition gave us a gift card. What a great place!

I had fried oysters, and granted you can't mess that up to bad, these were cooked just right (not over done) the baked potato could have been a river boat and was loaded down with all the yummy topping you could wish for. The lobster bisque had nice chunks of lobster in it and it was served with French bread and butter. Now the gumbo was not my favorite all though I was impressed that there were oysters in it. I will also admit I'm from Louisiana and I have a high standard for gumbo as my pawpaw is basically a master at making it. The staff was super friendly. Two request- please get a remoulade sauce, it goes good on everything- and get some family dinning specials. I would love to take my three sons for a meal with out having to sell a kidney.",

    "text": "Spend your money elsewhere!  First time at Pappadeaux we had a bad experience with 1 staff member, brought it to the attention of management and were given a $50 gift card to make things right (was a pretty bad experience, not normally complainers)  When returned for a 2nd time, to use the gift card, the hostess sat our party of 3 in between 2-10+ person parties.  Our 4 person table was squished in between the 2 parties that when the server went to take people's orders at the big party she was literally standing over top of me, shouting to the people on the other side of the table.  We asked to move as they clearly had open tables in other areas that were not so cramped - it was such an ordeal to allow us to move 30 ft to a new table.  We get a new table and it takes 15-20 minutes before anyone comes over.  By this time it's about 6:15pm and we know happy hour is only until 6:30pm.  We asked for a round of drinks and are told happy hour is only available in the bar area.  WTF.  We decline ordering drinks at the table and one of use walks to the bar, orders happy hour priced drinks and brings them back to our table.  Genius!  Apparently this is frowned upon though, oh well.  And the happy hour drink prices are laughable, a sweet tea...whatever its called was $8 - what the hell does it cost non-happy hour.    Their food is horribly over priced for what you get, its on par with Red Lobster and almost twice as expensive.  My friend ordered the stuffed crab and the server lets her know there is no crab in this dish, its 2 empty crab shells stuffed with breading, shrimp and fish bits.  12 shrimp cost about $17, I did not see any evidence that they had been dipped in gold prior to the fryer.  My friends Caesar salad has ONE lone crouton floating in the soggy, limp lettuce.  Our server, Jimmy was empathetic that we were having a rough experience and he gave us a creme brulee on the house.  Not to sound unappreciative, but I'm glad we didn't pay for it, was just meh.  Time to pay.  Our bill comes to $72.  We have the $50 gift card and throw in $40 in cash and decide to let Jimmy keep the difference which is a pretty nice tip, since he had given us dessert.  He picks up the check book and we tell him we are good, no change needed.  We start to get ready to leave and another server/manager perhaps comes over w/ a receipt showing we owe $18 after the gift card was charged.  The $40 has disappeared, did Jimmy think we gave him a $40 tip??  To avoid any further annoyance we just leave and leave the $18 DUE receipt on the table.    Go to Red Lobster :)",

We come here often enough and at times in larger groups. Once we were seated we were greeted by a really personable server. The food here is always great! I understand that a party of 20 can be challenging. We let the server know we would be doing separate checks right off the bat. I'm not sure what happened but the ends of the table were asked for a drink order and appetizer but the middle was never approached. Waters came out and bread. Next thing I know appetizers were out and I never got to put one in so I just figured ok entree it is. Well once again server came out to take the order sporadically. She would take an order and than walk away. I thought it was a little strange why not take all the entree orders at once? Well after the entrees came out no one came out to check on us or they would have found out we were missing three entrees. When those of us who got our food were finished we were left waiting for the check. Several in the party had to try and find someone to bring us the check and take the payments. At this point the dinner had gone on longer than what anyone had planned for and everyone needed to go home. We didn't even get to do cake and sing happy birthday because by the end everyone was feeling really disappointed and tired. The missing entrees eventually came out at the end of the meal. No manager came by to apologize for the service or to make sure everything was ok. Overall the food and drinks that did come out were great but the execution left little to be desired.",

Their crawfish is nicely seasoned as it includes a corn and few small potatoes. My good friend always order the soft shell crabs and lobster bisque, both are delicious. Then again, all their food is delicious.  The one thing I find good is their customer service. I've had a few visits where my food came out cold, too slow, or wrong order (which often happens at restaurants anyways) and the manager came over to apologize and comped that meal, even when honestly half the time I don't even realize it.  If you are a seafood fan, don't hesitate to come here. You won't be disappointed.",

I like the change of pace and it's large enough that you rarely have to wait being seated around noon.  For groups of 8-10 ask for the Wine Room off the bar for a more intimate dining experience with groups.  It's a nice quiet room where they store their wines, a great place to have conversation when you are with an oversized group.  The courtyard is nice transition zone from the parking lot and helps set mood.  Unfortunately when you get in it can be a bit noisy.",

Our server, JENNIFER (a trainer) was awesome. Never wanted, needed or had to ask for anything. She was on top of her game! Food was hot, fresh and came out in a relatively quick amount of time. I had the fried shrimp & catfish filets again and my wife tried the Lobster & Crab salad. We were both happy. We also started with a lobster bisque which was just slightly on the salty side. I still think the portions are small in relation to price. I had 5 shrimp and 2 catfish filets ($25). Overall, a save on their part in customer retention.",

The hostess said it would take an hour and a half, so we saddled up to the bar instead.    The bartender's were nice, but way understaffed.  It was taking an average of 5-10 minutes for new people to get recognized.   The bread and butter was the highlight of our meal......warm, crisp and fresh tasting.  My girlfriend's salad was loaded with dressing that was mediocre tasting ( she only had a few bites).  But,my gumbo was pretty good and very fresh tasting.    My girlfriend's mussels and lobster dish was overcooked as the seafood was hard and rubbery, while my crispy salmon dish barely resembled the awesome picture on the menu cover.  It tasted bland and only had a single, tiny speck of the delicious crab advertised on the picture.  We ate exactly 1/3 of our meal before calling it a night, and a hundred and fifteen dollars later, we left disappointed.",

    "text": "Location: Phoenix, AZ  Parking: Not an issue at all since I walked here from my hotel, but there's a massive parking lot with many available spaces.  Ambiance: The ambiance and decor immediately transport you to the bayou, although I have never been to the bayou and only know it from what I've seen in the media.  Went twice during my stay in Phoenix.  Once during dinner and also a to-go order for lunch.  During dinner, it was very dim and some would say too dim to even see what you are eating.  Very loud so you can forget about having a nice, tranquil conversation with whomever you are dining alongside.  Service: DINNER - service was ok.  I got really irked when I asked for recommendations from our waiter.  Their menu is massive and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I asked for some recommendations and the waiter immediately blurted out the most expensive thing on the menu and nothing else.  Hmm so just one recommendation...do you really think that's good, or are you just fishing for a bigger bill which will lead to a bigger tip?  Water refills were on time, and the wait staff was for the most part attentive, so the recommendation thing was the only major downfall. LUNCH - Called in my order and said it would be ready in 10-15 min.  Walked over from my hotel (about a 10-15 min walk) and went inside.  Hostess pointed me to the to-go pick-up area.  Went over and waited for another 5 min before being attended to.  Paid for my order and waited another 5 min before receiving my food.  Waited a total of 20-25 min for my food.  Not that big of a deal, but they should know this for future reference.  Food: DINNER - After receiving a short-ended recommendation, I had to look over the menu a little bit more so my table mates placed their orders first.  I ended up getting the Crawfish Etoufee.  The dish was filled with crawfish.  Everything tasted fine except the white rice.  I'm Filipino so I've had my fair share of rice in my lifetime.  This rice tasted like minute rice.  That might fly in Phoenix, but in my world I expect something a little better.  At least the rest of the dish kinda sorta made up for it.  Portions are huge!  Everyone at my table had leftovers.  I would've had leftovers too but I was pretty hungry and ended up leaving super stuffed! LUNCH - I ordered the \"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo & Shrimp Po Boy.  Now this was good!  Gumbo had a bounty of different seafood and tasted awesome.  The po boy had plenty of fried shrimp.  The bread on the po boy could have been better.  When I dipped the po boy into the gumbo MAN OH MAN was that BANGIN!!  Here's a tip for a new menu item: instead of a \"French Dip,\" how bout a 'FRENCH QUARTER' DIP = Shrimp Po Boy + (\"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo - white rice).  Dip the po boy in the gumbo and as Chef Emeril Lagasse would say BAM!!!  Overall: 3.5 STARS this place is A-OK.  It is a bit overpriced.  If it weren't for the great lunch I had, I probably would have given it a lower rating.  Get the GUMBO and PO BOY and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been here several times and have always been pleased with the quality of our meals.  It's hard to find fresh seafood in Phoenix and this place has delivered time and again. We always go during their happy hour which is from 3-6 M-F in their bar area which includes seats at the HUGE bar top and a few booths.  Not sure if HH is available on the patio... Compared to their normal menu prices ($$$) their HH pricing is fantastic.  And if you have a hankering for oysters this is the place to go.  Last time we went we got a dozen  of delicious Gulf Coast oysters for $7.95. They have several other HH food items in the $4-$7 price range ( calamari, catfish poboys, steamed cajun shrimp served with sausage and corn on the cob) but our favorite by far is the alligator.  They typically serve it fried but on our first visit our server recommended trying it blackened. We went with her suggestion and were not disappointed. It is served with a rich, brown sauces that is is on it's own fantastic. The drink prices on their HH are decent as well.  I usually go with their specialty cocktail \"The Swampthing\" It's a deceptively strong, frozen drink that I highly suggest. Get the large, it comes in an icy goblet that will keep your drink nice and cold as you enjoy your meal. They also have a good draft beer selection if that is more your thing.  The bill between the two of us is usually around $50 for a few  apps, a couple drinks a piece and a dozen oysters. They will also provide you with some fresh baked bread.  The regular menu is rather large and features a variety of seafood.  You have quite the selection to choose from including alaskan king crab legs, live maine lobster  and all sorts of fish.  I think I saw a scallop dish or two on there as well.  They also have several \"combination\" platters that feature fried shrimp, fish, stuffed shrimp, stuffed crab, etc. My husband once ordered a cajun tilapia (mahi perhaps?) with scallops dish that he loved off their \"Specialty Menu\". I can suggest the live lobster as well.  On one visit I saw the lobster tank and couldn't help myself. They actually had an 8 lb lobster in there! He proudly carried the title \"KIng of the Tank\" He was $159 and probably would have been worth every cent but I opted for one of the smaller guys.  I was not disappointed.  Mr Delicious was served with drawn butter and a side of pasta (linguine with diablo sauce I believe) and I have actually gone back and ordered just the side of pasta it was so good!   The restaurant itself is rather large but it is always busy so get there early or at least call ahead.  Especially if you have a larger group.",

Our friend's ordered the oysters & they were undercooked, which can be dangerous.  The cheese grits, However, we're excellent.  In a small town perhaps I could understand the popularity of this restaurant but, in a city like Phoenix there are too many other restaurants with the same type food for less money & better food.

Family paks start at over 60 dollars so it would have been a nice ticket for them, but I guess they are doing so well they don't need or want that type of business.

This area is large and overly noisy and it's difficult to even communicate here.  For dinner I ordered the Pasta Mardi Gras Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. The dish was tasty and the seafood was fresh except for the crawfish which was out of season. The pasta was not temperature hot - I think the noodles were cold and that made the dish lukewarm. The other entree we tried was Seafood Platter - Fried tilapia fillet, shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab and french fries. This was just eh! There was much filler on the stuffed items and I thought was pricey for what we received. Favorite item was the tilapia. For dessert we split the mint chocolate chip cheesecake which was yummy.  Our waiter was the best - very attentive to details constantly checked in with our needs and handled every request immediately. He was formerly employed at Pappadeaux in Houston but this gent could work at any dinning establishment.",

They brought out new food pretty fast so that was a plus. Also, Personal space was an issue. I must have been in the wrong seat. I was brushed up on and touched way too many times. At one point, I got up and moved to the other side of the table because i had no space of my own left between myself and the server.  I paid way too much for average food and really bad service. I will never come back here again. Totally not worth it.",

About 30 minutes later the hostess came by and knowledge this and asked if we wanted anything a salad or soup? I asked for some bread. Then we got some bread. 10 minutes later she came back and apologized again and said she would comp our dinner. I was very pleased on how the restaurant handled this. I had to wait a long time yes but we were not mad or throw a fit or anything but they just somehow made my dining experience a positive one giving of course we would return again! My fish was cooked perfectly. Great job on customer service!",

    "text": "Came here the Saturday before Mother's day. It was busy, 1 hour and 45 minute wait, which we were expecting. We called earlier to make reservations, but were told all reservations booked up 2 weeks prior.  Got drinks & apps at the bar to pass the time. Closed out the tab there as it could not be transferred to the table.  When we finally sat, our waitress Megan did not bring out utensils. I had a few questions about the menu, she didn't know the answers. She compred some dishes as \"similar\" as her only form of description and after a simple google search, I found they were very opposite. We started to eat some bread after placing our orders, but there was no Megan around to ask for napkins. I saw a bucket and grabbed some for the table. A manager saw and half-apologized.   Our food came 30 minutes later and my dish was completely wrong. Megan claimed my hard shell crab was soft shell. She claimed she brought me a dish that wasn't on the menu. She tried to cover up her mistake. I wasn't having the lies and just asked her to take it back. Not once did she apologize or say sorry. A different manager came over and gave me the right dish to go.   Started to eat a side of the dirty rice someone at my table got, it had a LARGE onion shell in it and was very dry.  We tried to get our check but Megan disappeared. Waited another 10 minutes to flag her down.  It seemed they were understaffed - even though they had been expecting this crowd for over 2 weeks. Kinda felt bad for Megan, but that wasn't an excuse. Please steer clear of this place. Customer service and food are subpar.",

    "text": "This restaurant is by far one of the best places to eat in the valley.  If you want great food and great customer service, Pappadeux's is the place to go.  We go here a few times a year.  We went there today for my wife's birthday.  Nia was our server and she did an outstanding job.  We did have one issue, but it was taken care of very quickly.  I had ordered a dish and when I received it, it wasn't cooked all the way through.  We brought it to Nia's attention, and she agreed that it was not cooked properly.  We were very polite with her, by not getting upset, because it was not her fault, nor did we blame anyone else.  She made it right by letting us order something else off of the menu.  A short time later two of Pappadeaux's managers, Stephanie and Brooke came to our table to apologize.  We told them that everything was okay and that we were able to order something else off of the menu.  They told us that they would compensate us for that meal, that wasn't prepared properly.  I understand doing that, but like I told Stephanie and Brooke, we are not those kind of people that go out for a way to try and get a free meal from a restaurant.   Granted they did the right thing, but that's not what I was looking for.  Hopefully we made up for the meal, by giving Nia a little extra in her tip.  Great job Pappadeaux's for hiring great people like Stephanie, Brooke and Nia  Brad and Kim",

So we went back together and I recognize that this place is pretty unique to other restaurants in the area. For one it is French creole type of food, which is hard to find around here and a unique flavor. Secondly, I do think the seafood is pretty fresh compared to most places in AZ (the lobsters are right there in the tanks). I tried the seafood sampler and it had a delicious mixture of crab, jumbo shrimp, mussles, tilapia, and others served fried with tartar n cocktail sauce. I think I was disappointed the first time bc most of the seafood is fried and I was expected it to be baked or broiled. My husband gets the steak and lobster served with butter sauce which was very good. The mashed potatoes are garlicky-how I like them. Third I love the ambience and landscaping of the place. The bread pudding for desert was to die for, very comfort food. I will stay say this place is expensive, but for a treat now and then its worth it plus seafood tends to be expensive anywhere.  Every time I go this place is packed n prob for a good reason.",

But my go to is the salmon Alexander. It's has the best salmon, crawfish and scallops combo. I usually get the smaller piece because it's a lot of food. The appetizers are awesome as well. I always get the oyster duo and the seafood fondue. Even the bread is good there. Makes sure you get the crawfish or the lobster bisque for starters.",

    "text": "Pappadeaux has been around here for a long time.  It is a \"chain\" restaurant with locations in eight states.  I would say it's a high-end cajun seafood restaurant with a substantial menu.  I remember coming here a couple of decades ago, and we finally returned with my family recently.  We got seated at a round table for 5 and our hostess was very gracious and attentive.  After looking at our menu for a while, we opted to get the large order of crispy fried alligator bites.  After a few minutes, we upgraded to the Appetizer Trio, with mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux (this was EXCELLENT), calamari with octopus and fried alligator.  It was seriously too much food.  After eating our complimentary bread and working our way through the appetizer trio, most of us were already stuffed!  Still, we ordered our main entrees:   * Pasta Mardi Gras - FANTASTIC...omg  * Shrimp & Scallop Orecchiette Pasta - WOW, a stunner  * Kids fried chicken & shrimp plates  Seniors get lunch prices on entress ALL DAY, so my mother took advantage and ordered a sampler platter off the lunch menu.  We verified on the bill and yes, it was the lunch price.  Overall our service and food was excellent.  We paid dearly for it:  bill came to $260 after tip.  That hurts the wallet let me tell you, but the food was really worth it.  I literally had leftovers for three nights in a row!  Will most definitely come back, after I save up for a year or so ;)",

There were a couple of little things that I'd normally rate lower, but the meal was so amazing & afterall, that's what you come for, so a perfect rating it is.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail (perfectly done shrimp), and two lobster tail dinners (absolutely amazing)!   Not sure why we never came here before. Likely because we're not into Cajun type food & that's what we were picturing. But no, they also prepared classic seafood options & ten times better than Red Lobster, (which was always our go to until now)...none of that overcooked tough lobster here. I was always convinced you just can't find decent seafood in the desert so never really looked. Everything we ordered was huge, from the shrimp to the lobster tail to the baked potato (a meal in itself)! Everything was cooked to perfection & the wait staff & welcoming hostess staff were so friendly, always smiling...it was a very welcoming & happy atmosphere.   The only down side is it's very loud when crowded & it was very busy & you definitely need to raise your voice to have a conversation. In spite of the crowd, the food came out fast, however our check did not & getting the check & paying seemed to take the longest of it all, but it was Christmas Eve & the meal itself I'd rate as one of the best I've ever had. Their lobster was so perfectly cooked, they definitely know how to make them. We'll never go to Red Lobster again!",

Most visits have been pretty good - the worst was when they lost my reservation completely even though I could prove I called and everything. Luckily we got there fairly early so the wait for a table wasn't TOO long. The visit was off to a rocky start and the service was ok.   We decided to give Pappadeaux another chance and skipped the reservation this time (after what happened last time). We were seated in the alcove area which was nice, minus the fact our waitress kept forgetting about us. Water was warm and nearly hot, food arrived without silverware, bread basket never arrived, we had to ask several times for side plates. Luckily the food was still delicious in spite of the mediocre service.   We ordered the lobster salad which is a favorite, the fried alligator, the shrimp and grits, coconut shrimp and key lime pie. Although the key lime pie was a standard key lime pie it was delicious! The coconut shrimp stole the show for sure, we ended up liking it better than the alligator (which is why we started coming here).",

When we went to pay the waiter said our meals were paid for by someone who wishes to remain anonymous.  He then brought us gift cards for Pappadeauxs.  While visiting Phoenix we found they had a Pappadeauxs so here we are.  Pappalonnes and I had the Crawfish combo.  Fried mud bugs separated by dirty rice from Crawfish etouffee.  Wow the roux was perfect.  Just the right amount of spice.  We both loved it.  Baby mama had the shrimp and grits.  She gave it a 5.  Velvet had the Greek salad and the coconut shrimp.  She was very satisfied. I hope I can do as well.  Service by Jackie was over the top.  Give her a raise.  Thank you to the anonymous gifter.",

It gets busy pretty much EVERYDAY not just on weekends so if you are going with a big group or even just a few people and are gonna want a table, I would recommend calling ahead.   I would have to say their best deal is when their oysters are on sale for something like 4 buck a dozen. They aren't the most premium oysters (out of season) but still pretty good, especially when they are at a bargain price. Try their blue cheese chopped salad its great, they have some kind of special blue cheese dressing that is something to brag about.",

Carrie was enthusiastic, really attentive without being overbearing or annoying, and just overall super awesome.  We came in for lunch around 1 p.m. (their lunch is until 3), and I ordered the sampler platter, but I don't really like tilapia, so I asked if I could get some calamari instead of tilapia - done, without a hassle. Mum got the crawfish lunch. The bread they bring out is amazing, by the way. Our food was out in probably ten minutes. Not only did I have an abnormally huge portion of calamari on my plate, but our waitress brought me out all the sauces that go with the calamari - their spicy marinara and a lemon aioli that you will stare at for several minutes and wonder how an aioli can taste that good. Yup. Several minutes. Our waitress checked in on us often, and when we were done, boxed up our meal for us while we got our check.  It was really hot out, and I was dreading walking to the car to sit on sizzling black leather seats, and before I know it BAM! There is a take-out cup for each of us, filled with our respective drink choice, our food bagged up and extra sauce for my leftoevers in little plastic take-out cups... Has anyone ever seen such awesome service? If you go... you better ask for Carrie. If you don't, you will be incredibly and horribly jealous that you did not get the best waitress I have ever SEEN.",

The oysters and cocktail shrimps were nice and plump not the miniature sized ones you would find in other chain seafood restaurants.  I ordered the deep fried soft shell crab and it was amazing as usual and my gf ordered the mahi mahi with the cheese grits and green beans.  One thing that my gf complained was that the menu did not have indications of the food being spicy.  Her grits were a little bit spicy.  But I told her it's kind of inferred since it is Cajun style.  Other than that, food was fantastic.  And would definitely try it if you're in the PHX area.",

    "text": "I'm having a real hard time writing a review for this restaurant. I want to write a great review, but I don't wanna use the words \"superb\" or \"excellent\" when describing the food, and I don't wanna say the service was \"friendly\" since all of these are overdone. So let me give this a shot:   Upon walking inside I'm greeted with \"The Saints Go Marching In\" playing in the background and the aroma of some great food being served. The four of us go to the auxiliary bar (4 stools inside, main purpose is to drink up the patio guests) and have a seat and order drinks from our lovely waitress. Her timing was right on the button with EVERYTHING as drinks were always full and there was no lull between courses.   As for the food, WOW. For the appetizer I went with an order of the Lotsa Shrimp. One dozen cold boiled shrimp (whatever cold boiled means) served with cocktail sauce mixed with fresh horseradish. Boy let me tell you that puts every shrimp cocktail I've had between San Francisco and New York to shame. Just the right amount of kick to it, but not the same old lame old.   For the entree I had the Pasta New Orleans. Overall just an explosion in Cajun flavoring going on in my bowl. A wonderful blend of linguine, crawfish, sausage, mushrooms, and jumbo shrimp mixed in with a creamy yet spicy marinara sauce. And unlike every other place that skimps on the fish, you will not be disappointed here. Portions here are big, so bring an appetite.   I hate writing lengthy reviews, (yes this is lengthy to me) but this place deserves it. One of the best meals I've had in a long time as far as value for the meal, overall presentation of the meal and restaurant, and just an overall well trained and attentive staff.   I normally don't drive west of the 51 freeway, but I'm looking for reasons to do so now.",

I love the soft shell crabs with a load mashed potato. I've also tried the Alaskan King Crab, Lobster, and Salmon and Pappadeaux never dissapoints. They sometimes have specials for a half dozen oysters for only $5.   I'm from Los Angeles and I wished they tore down all the Red Lobsters and Joe's Crab Shacks and opened a couple of these restaurants closer to home.",

    "text": "Father-in law was in town and felt like some seafood. I thought nowhere better to take this out of town-er than Pappadeaux's.. My husband and I have eaten a few times here for lunch and everytime it's been out of control good. We arrived friday night, no waiting needed.   We sat in the back and ordered drinks, and a medium size gator app, yes as in alligator. My margarita was very sweet, felt like they added a cup of sugar in it, and it came in a fu/fu glass. The gator was good, but too small for three people.  Wait staff was very nice and explained that the fish flys in fresh daily, and went into detail of the dishes we were going to order. I ordered the Marti Gra.. My husband and his dad got some seafood array?? not sure of the name.. but it looked good. My main dish came and woohoo... it was slammin good. It had crawfish, sausage, shrimp over a bed of creamy pasta.. it was so good, I could only eat 1/4 of the bowl. The portion sizes are pretty big. By the way there bread is baked daily and is so good, they serve a loaf of it for an app, if you eat the whole thing you can ask for another. (Very Good stuff)   Anyways.. always fantastic food, if you have visitors from out of town that like seafood I would recommend this place... Lunch is cheaper, around $12-16 a plate.. Dinner from $15-35.",

I realised today that I was so close but so far away from an amazingly delicious kitchen of Pappadeaux Seafood for those 4 long years... wish somebody had told me about this place earlier and I would have spent at least a double dozen nights at Pappadeaux while I was in Phoenix... what an amazing place !  We started with a bowl of \"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo... yummmm... spicy and so tasty ! ... (those who don't go for spicy food should stay a yard away from it... it was really spicy... as in Indian Vindaloo spicy... ) ... I felt like I could have easily had a couple more of that gumbo... :)  Shrimp Creole With white rice and Crawfish Etouffee With dirty rice followed that gumbo... both of these were so mouth watering... a perfectly cooked Crawfish with rice so close to Jambalaya, it was probably the best seafood I have had after my last visit to New Orleans...  The place carried a very nice, relaxed ambiance with light jazz in the background... our server was very soft spoken and knew her way through the menu and preparations... I don't think this place gets crowded easily as it could sit, to my guess, 5 times more number of guests that an averagely large restaurant...   Overall, definite 5 stars for variety, taste, ambiance and service... be it a family or a romantic one on one dinner, this place is just too awesome !",

    "text": "I love Pappadeaux. I've been going to Pappadeaux for over ten years starting in Houston. When they opened up the one in Phoenix, I was sooo ecstatic! Seafood in Arizona! And I don't have to drive 40 min to Scottsdale to enjoy it!  Before I gush, I will say that I have received some crappy service. When it's bad, you have to make sure you get your waiter to bring you everything you need at once, otherwise it may take a while to track him or her down. Usually these are the times when the place is really busy so I guess I can't get too mad. For the most part though, the waiters know the menu, can offer some good suggestions and come back often for refills.   OK, now for some love. Seriously, Love love LOVE when it's $3.95/per dozen oyster time. You do have to make sure it's the right time of the season otherwise you can get some measly oysters. But 99% of the time the oysters are incredibly tasty and fresh. For the person complaining about slow oyster service, they shuck their oysters when you order them. So when they've got 8 orders, there is going to be a wait. I don't know what oysters you're used to eating, but I know shucking oysters is not easy. (Plus you're doing all that work and you don't get to eat them! That would be torture for me!)  I've had a lot of the main fish entrees and they've all been very yummy. It is really pricey, but one entree at Pappadeaux's can last me 2, maybe even 3 meals. It's the damn butter! It fills me up! Butter, you ask? YES! Pappadeaux has the most taste bud pleasing, whipped, salted butter that I have ever eaten. It helps polish down that loaf of freshly toasted french bread that impedes entree eating time.  Fave dessert is the creme brulee for sure. Best way to end the meal. How I have ever had room for dessert, though, is beyond me. Dang butter.  Other dishes I recommend: Calamari, alligator, Greek salad, crawfish etoufee (!!!), soft shelled crab (broiled and fried, ask to go easy on the salt), crawfish gumbo (they only have seafood gumbo listed, but you can ask to have crawfish only)",

My wife had the Halibut Picata for dinner and I had the Snapper with Live Maine Lobster. The fish was cooked perfectly and the respective sauces were rich and citrusy balanced to perfection. The sides were great as well. For dessert we had the Strawberry Cheesecake and the Carrot Cake Cheesecake. Both were very good. The staff was freindly and engaging. Our waitress was very helpful and knew alot about the menu. We always ask our first time at a new place and she was very very good. This place is all class, the food is delicous and the staff is fantastic. I highly reccomend this place when you're in the mood for seafood.",

They are great with mixing and matching sauces and fishes.  We also ordered a dozen raw oysters and oyster pappadeux.  There are hints of southern style cuisine such as dirty rice, crawfish sauce, and any seafood you like fried.  As for actual taste, I didn't get much southerness from the flavors.  The second time, we got the seabass and two of us got the all you can east lobster. The seabass was cooked well and the sauce was tasty. The lobsters came with dirty rice as the side and it was pretty good. The lobsters are a good decent size and good quality lobsters. I finished 5 of them and the other finished 9 of them. I think eating 3 would be good. i cant say it is necessarily a good deal because it is just eating too much lobster unnecessarily. The time in between each round of new lobster fluctuated a lot and the service was just decent.",

    "text": "Last night, we again experienced Pappadeaux excellent food!  Because we eat out 3 times a week and have dined here many times before, I feel qualified to review accurately and honestly. 1. Caesar salad dressing is much improved.  It frequently  has been too bitter to enjoy.  I believe that the kitchen preps, reamed out too much of the inside whites of the lemons, which is very bitter.  (juice and zest are not, but the white membrane is very bitter) Why not add (more?) anchovy paste?  That is TRUE Caesar and as a high-end seafood specialty restaurant...you need \"Authentic Caesar\" with anchovy! Thank you for little or no vinegar! 2. Excelent Reisling wine.  However, Margherita on the rocks was so bitter, my man could not enjoy it and didn't order a second one. Tart is good, bitter is miserable. 3. Pappadeaux always has the BEST  Halibut in town!  Rivals the best we have had in Seattle, where it is the freshest. You manage to keep it moist without under-cooking.  The crab topping however was in very short supply last night!  You have skimped on it and we don't appreciate that on a $37. Entree! 4. Salmon topped with crab was also excellent...rivals our many meals in Washington state...again,  short supply of crab on top for a second $37. Entree. 5. Vegies were fine. 6.  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside French bread was consistently good.   Of course, we will return.  Glad to see the improvements in the salad you made and hoping for anchovies in future.  Happy about the wine, entrees excellent.  Work on the other issues mentioned above... All-in-all....excellent fare!",

Love was in the air that night especially since the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Not exactly what I would call a romantic intimate setting but hey, it worked for them because the lady said yes!  I love their crawfish, the fried alligator, and the Pappadeux oysters.  I haven't really ventured out to try anything else besides those three items.  The crawfish they serve up here has good flavor and are big but not exactly the best with all the new crawfish boil shops popping up.  I do think their fried alligator is still the best in town especially with their dipping sauce.  As for the Pappadeux oysters, what's not to love?  It's a dressed up oyster!  This place gets packed fast, it's always super loud in here, and the decor is kind of tacky and gimmicky but it's a seafood restaurant so what do you really expect?

I think we got 10 nuggets of gator and the calimari was more fried artichoke hearts than calimari. At $20 a pop a real disappointment. Entrees were masked by butter and heavy cream sauce. No real flavor and again at these prices the fish should have been incredibly fresh.  On the positive side, the desserts were very good. Had the cheese cake and seven layer cake.  Our service was wonderful. Ashleigh was charming, attentive and prompt. Unfortunately not enough. I would never go back. A shame. Also made me lose confidence in Yelp reviews.",

This is my boyfriends favorite restaurant, which is why I brought him, and now my absolute favorite as well. We started off with an appetizer; a dozen blue point oysters. For people who don't know me, I love pretty much all seafood except oysters and squid (I used to love squid but the texture freaks me out. Maybe someday I'll love it again) but my boyfriend wanted me to try it, even though I knew previously I didn't like it. So I did. He put lemon on it and there was 3 sauces to choose from. There was one that reminds me of soy sauce mixed with wasabi, like a person would dip their sushi in. But I'm not sure if that was what it was. But I put that on mine and it was actually really good. So officially I like oysters now!! And then we both got a soup cup. He got the lobster bisque and I got the Louisiana seafood gumbo which I have ALWAYS wanted to try! Both soups were super yummy. I was very impressed. So far I had not been let down! Next was our actual meal. I got the pasta Mardi Gras and my boyfriend got the grilled Caribbean lobster tail. My pasta was amazing. I've always been big on pasta. The sauce was tasty and it has sausage and shrimps in it. My boyfriends included lobster, mashed red potatoes and broccolini. His was good too. Lastly, I had told the waitress by the name of devyn (I think that's how she spelled it) who by the way was very nice and friendly. She had great customer service. If you go, definitely ask to be seated in her area!! Anyways I told her that it was my boyfriends birthday so at the end they offered complimentary dessert. They had so many good ones to choose from. We picked the banana pudding. Haha thinking about it makes me hungry and my mouth water. I've had banana pudding before. I usually only like my family's cause it's a family recipe but pappadeux's knows how to make some amazing banana pudding. Lastly a couple things, if you are going for a special occasion, I recommend making a reservation. I was so glad I made a reservation. When we got there it was so packed, inside and out. Second, the place is beautiful. If you can, and you know it's going to be a nice day, I'd say sit outside. We didn't get to, but that's okay. Thirdly, everyone there is nice and quick and efficient. Please check this place out! They deserve some more good business.  I can't wait to go back again.",

The peach ice tea was great, with a fresh taste to it. We ordered the large basket of calamari which was shared between 3 people. Large, warm  French bread was included and it was fresh. With so many options to choose from, I chose the Seafood Platter. The seasoning was not overwhelming, but rather just enough, to still know you had seafood on your plate. This meal is actually enough to share with your special person.   I highly recommend this place for just about any special occasion or with a group of friends.",

    "text": "I prefer my food from the land and not the sea so seafood is not a dining favorite of mine. My picky style has never resisted me for taking up an opportunity to dine at Pappadeux as they have on shore tasty items on the menu. I always seem to dive into the crispy chicken fingers along with the wide variety of sides, however my last visited I was tempted to try the broiled half chicken. Boy was I impressed. It was so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Not only was it not dry but it was juicy. Matter of fact those seafood eaters who dined with me tasted a sample and wanted to clean my plate. Too bad and so sad for them they will have to come back because I ate it all. Along with the spaghetti squash and a bed of white rice.   The great thing about this restaurant is they have a wide variety of options to choose from. A large dining area for larger parties and even a private room. You can dine casually to a romantic date or even have a party the whole crew will be impressed. They even have a full size bar with the same great menu.   Pappadeaux the place to go!",

    "text": "This place is more hype than anything. Being from the south, I was surrounded by places that fried-up seafood, which is apparently what this place is all about. It has some more \"cajun\" style things than I'm used to, like fried frog legs, but still same concept: food put in a deep fat fryer. Yippee.  Being bored with such fried vittles, I opted for shrimp creole with andouille cheese grits. It was okay, but for the price ($22.50) it was a huge rip-off. I was with my company and thus wasn't paying, but I'd be mad if I had paid 23 bucks for a few shrimp in an average creole with an ice cream scoop full of grits.  I got their New York cheesecake, too, but it was typical restaurant (think Applebee's) quality, complete with food-colored cherry sauce.  The highlight of the place was the service, as our waitress and hostess were both very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is all right, too, but still pretty typical of a cookie-cutter franchise like Olive Garden.  I dunno, maybe I sound like a fuddy-duddy, but certainly not as exciting or \"authentic\" as other reviewers would have you believe.",

Our first visit was great, we both loved to food and our service was excellent but our next visit was just horrible!  My sister wanted to celebrate her Birthday there and made reservations for a party of 13, friends and family on Saturday 10th of February. Management asked that the entire party be there by 7:45 pm in which we all were. At 7:45 we were informed that the party before us had not left the area reserved for us and that we would have to wait till 8pm. We all waited patiently and stood chatting because of the crowd there. At 8pm they informed us that a couple of people were still sitting in the area we reserved and instead of asking them to leave or go to another area the forced us to wait a entire hour! My sister got emotionally upset because a couple of friends and family members got tired of waiting and left. It was the worst example of management I've seen anywhere and totally unprofessional. We were all starving and forced to wait on other people when she had tables reservations for us. They tried to make things a little better by offering free entrees but my sister was so upset because they had ruined her special moment and Birthday with everyone she invited. Some of us drove 45 minutes to an hour just to be there. The food wasn't satisfactory for some of us, maybe because expectations were ruined from wrongfully having to wait when we shouldn't have. All in all it was the worst moment at a restaurant me and my family and friends have ever had, one star would be too much. I don't know if we will ever give our buisness to them again.",

    "text": "We used to love Pappadeaux when I lived in San Antonio and in Phoenix but this trip we had a less than steller experience. I want to love this restaurant with the cool vibe and atmosphere. It started out with Bread that was a little over done on the outside, and then their version of Lobster Bisque which was a little too cajun for my liking, but it is a cajun restaurant after all so they won't loose any points there. The Wife had a good Pasta dish with Crab and scallops which was a little peppery but still good.   I ordered a stuffed 2 lb lobster which was a cluster from the beginning. About 5 minutes after i ordered it, the server came out and said they were out of 2lb lobsters but they could give me 2 one pounders for the same price, so i went with it. Another 5 minutes passes and out comes a manager and trainee with a menu telling me they are completely out of lobsters and I would need to select something else. Then another 5 minutes pass and the server comes back out, takes my menu and says the manager didn't know what she was talking about and he has them working on my 2 1 lb. lobsters. Now another 10 minutes pass and out comes my meal, and i get 2 1 lb. lobsters, however they forget to stuff them. So now we get another visit from a different manager apologizing yet again for the mixup. I finally get my lobster and it is overcooked and tough. Guess it wasn't my night for lobster, or theirs for that matter.  They did give us dessert on the house which was a nice gesture.  I think next time i'll pass on Pappadeaux.",

    "text": "Several years ago, when business travel to Houston was regular, I became a big fan of the Pappas family restaurants-- Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in particular.  As we drove north from Phoenix airport to Sedona I noticed a sign for Pappadeaux, and knew that this would be a lunch stop when the final portion of our vacation brought us back to Phoenix.  The restaurant is large, attractively appointed and comfortable, with an encyclopedic menu of fish and seafood offerings.  Although best known for their Cajun preparations, there are abundant choices for everyone who enjoys well-prepared fish and seafood.  Our server, Nicholaus, effortlessly navigated a crowded lunchtime dining room with our order.  Although a bit distant, he was a consummate professional.  Brought first to the table was a large platter of crispy fried alligator nuggets, served with a full-bodied spicy sauce.  I ordered a platter of fried oysters, one of my favorites, while my family selected po boy sandwiches of shrimp or alligator.  We each had a cup of their Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo.  The sandwiches were bountiful, and from what I was told, absolutely delicious.  The same could be said for the fried oysters.  A tartar sauce whose consistency was a bit less obvious as a packaged commercial product is all that separated this lunch from greatness.  The seafood was all fried just to the point of presenting a crispy coating surrounding tender, moist and flavorful protein.  Hardly an inexpensive lunch, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is in that class of restaurant that I would seek out wherever they operate.",

We were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.  Worth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs).",

The third, unfortunately, was my birthday.    The BOTTOM LINE:   I would go back, my spouse will not.  However, I would not risk a special occasion on this restaurant.    THE GOOD:   (1) a something-for-everyone menu  (2) truly spectacular tasting menu items  (3) managers seem genuinely contrite, and they are adroit at making good on mishaps.  (4) reservations are accepted, but waiting with a drink on the patio is a great experience.  THE BAD:  (1) a service bar so slow during dinner peak that you'd think the first step in making your drink was applying for a liquor license.  (2) if you're like me and appreciate a well paced meal, you'll have to DIY-it by specifying to the server when the kitchen is OK to begin preparing the next course. (inept and thoughtless pacing happened 3 of 4 times)  (3) You will invariably be first sat under a full-blast A/C vent or fan aimed at your upper back, and you will have to request a new table. (happens every time I sit inside)    The UGLY: The food quality is inconsistent. (3 of 4 visits resulted in myself or someone in my party sending back a deficient item for being too cold, overcooked, watery, etc.)  Rectifying the problem takes long enough to ruin the pacing of the meal for the table as whole.  Ordering is slight gamble, which, for a restaurant, is the deadliest sin of all.",

Great combinations that are not  overwhelmed with alcohol  (some may prefer a stronger drink but I'll forgo the \"burn\" with my dinner) Watermelon mule light and refreshing The Grand Hennessey definitely on the stronger side but still sweet and flavorful. Pink Sapphire who knew gin could be so tasty?  I did but it was good to have with dinner while the drink taste also light and....pink. Crab fingers...EAT THESE sauteed.  The lemon garlic butter sauce theyre sauteed in is  delicious. Seafood gumbo was bland and watery. Papadeaux's fried seafood platter was average at best. They had a parpadelle with Roasted squash, shrimp, scallops and crab meat that was very very good.  Pasta and seafood was fresh and the sauce creamy and garlicky. The star of the table was my Texas Redfish Pontchartrain, this was my 2nd time having redfish and it did not disappoint.  It's served with a brown butter that I can bathe in and dirty rice (dry).  Not over seasoned fish remained flaky and moist. EAT THIS!",

My father is the most high maintenance customer that ever came into a restaurant, in other words he is a huge pain in the ass. He thinks it is clever to ask for a plate of lemons, squeezes all of them into his water, adds sweet n low, and is proud he got free lemonade. He is also hyper critical of servers and demanding with no regard to everything they do. Don't even get me started on how he hits on female waitresses. Hey, I love my dad, but he is no picnic. I just wanted to give a little exposition so you would understand how fantastic the service was.  The waiter actually took the time to pay attention to my dad's unfunny comments as my mom and I cringed in embarrassment, even though I'm sure he had things to do. He made a decent wine by the glass recommendation for me, and gave me great ordering advice when I was wavering. He kept all our our drinks filled and the table cleaned as we finished things like soup and bread. We never wanted for anything from soup to dessert!  The lobster bisque was delicious, I had the Pappas Greek Salad, which was great, and prepared table side with flair. My parents split the Tilapia, which they loved, and the waiter brought them two plates without them even asking; thank God.  Since it was my mom's birthday we did dessert as well. Thank god I had soup and salad. Of course my dad had to ask for my mom's dessert to be comped in front of her since it was her birthday...classy. My mom and I both had the creme brulee, which was not the best I've ever had, but still pretty good creme brulee.  Our waiter was friendly, patient, attentive, and overall fabulous! Seriously, who knew service would be this wonderful here?  I will be back for sure!!!",

I had lobster bisque, it was really creamy and had great flavor.   The lunch was a halibut fillet sandwich and dirty rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned and fluffy. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was a very nice size. It was flaky and not dry at all.   The building was really neat, I think a nice outside happy hour would be great in mid to late October.   The service was perfect, not over pretentious or up on you the whole time.",

Dinner felt rushed, I didn't feel like a very valued client, and the poor gentleman next to me waited at least 25-30min for his 1/2 dozen oysters (carelessly drained of their delicious fluids).  My dinner was good, but relied heavily on it's fat content to carry it's flavor. My cocktails were good, I would come back for those.  It took another 10min just to pay my tab after I had finished. My dishes were cleaned up by a bartender who looked like he just run a marathon, dripping with sweat. Not exactly how I like to finish my evening.  Thanks, but no thanks Pappadeaux.",

I have family in Texas that rave about this chain, so when I when I drove by this one in Phoenix, I knew I had to check it out.  And as fate would have it, a friend decided to bring me here for happy hour.  We were on a mission to try the Category 5.  This is a blended drink which combines a house Margarita with a Hurricane.  This won't knock you out like a Hurricane, but it definately packs a punch.  What kind of punch you ask?  The one that let's you think that ordering FRIED Calamari (with artichokes), FRIED catfish (I think) and FRIED Alligator is a good idea.    Yeah, I said it.  \"FRIED GATOR\".  Yes, it tasted like chicken, and it was delicious.  I think after a Category 5, they could have fried up the sole of a shoe and I would have liked it.

The hostess even came by once during our wait to let us know they hadn't forgotten about us! I don't usually get fried calamari (I prefer non-fried seafood) but it was light and crispy and the calamari wasn't rubbery at all. Service was great, too.  We never had to ask to have our glasses refilled. it's a great place for a date or a group!",

Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!   I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!   Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite",

We were early and we were waiting for another friend to show up.  She finally arrived and we chatted during our wait.  Our half hour wait turned into an hour.  How did that happen????  My friend complained and we were seated just like that.  We made it to our table, relief.  Our waitress was friendly.  The bread was good.  There was a great special on gulf oysters and our waitress explained that the season was coming to an end.  $4 something for a dozen oysters.  Great deal.  They were tasty too.  We had them for an appetizer.  I was happy so far.  I ordered the scallops.  They were not huge.  In fact my entree was not that big portion wise.  I had to order a salad a la carte.  No bang for your buck here.  The scallops were over $20 bucks and adding a salad to that pushed my portion of the bill over $30.  I had an ice tea too.  I enjoyed my salad and the scallops were good.  BUT!  I felt a little ripped off.  One thing they have to change is the PA system.  \"Bob party of 3 your table is ready\" is heard loudly throughout the entire restaurant.  Yikes!!!  Change that please.  Pappadeaux's is A-OK.",

Sweet potato pecan pie ala mode, carrot cake cheesecake, creme brulee, bread pudding, banana pudding, all are good!  The list goes on.

I have to say that this is crawfish done right... and at $3.95/lb, you can't beat the value.  We started with an appetizer of Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux with garlic bread, which was free by using a coupon I got by signing up on their website and providing my e-mail address. I would've been a bit disappointed if I had paid for this particular appetizer, since it skimped on the bits of seafood and wasn't a particularly well-done fondue (not nearly cheesy enough), but it kept the group I was with something to nosh on while we waited on our entree orders. Judging from the other reviews, this place is always busy.  I was very happy with the 7-oz. Blackened Mahi Yvette covered with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms and spinach in a Monterey Jack cheese sauce. No need to order the larger 11-oz. filet, since I had already started filling up on bread, fondue, and a dinner salad. The dirty rice was delicious and scarfable.  Everyone seemed more than happy with their selections as we all shared and sampled from each others' plates of oysters on the half shell, boiled crawfish, and fried alligator. I think the place delivered a great value on the meal, a fantastic selection of nearly every Cajun delight you can think of (although I have yet to spot the elusive Muffaletta on area restaurants' menus), and a great dining experience. This place IS busy... I can only imagine the crowd on the weekends, but the wait staff did their best to be attentive and tend to all of our requests.  We left satisfied and stuffed, reeking of Cajun spices. Now if only they had some Oompah Loompahs available to roll me to my car...",

I do not know what is in it but it is quite tasty and pretty to look at (Yes, I'm a girl!).  I have never had dessert;  have always been too full.  However, my sister and nephew swear by the banana pudding which is served in a Mason jar (Ick!).  The only real draw back  to Pappadeaux is the wait for a table.

I ordered the cajun comb and my husband got the tilipia. While we're waiting for our meals to arrive our waiter offered us fresh baked bread right out of the oven. Not wanting to fill up on bread we declined. We're still sitting there when a roach scurries arcoss the ledge near our booth. ALL BUGS FREAK ME OUT!!!!!!! My husband said it wasn't that big a deal and I should just calm down. The table next to us received their food a couple of minutes before us, as soon as the waiter sat the food on the tray flies swarmed. I tried not to FREAK out but I was really getting uneasy about the safety of our food. Finally, our food comes out a couple of minutes later and I'm eyeballing it like a hawk.....no flies touched it, but it didn't stop them from trying to attack our food once it arrived. It's hard to enjoy your meal while you're swatting away flies and make sure roaches are coming up behind you.   On to the food, my fish was salty and my husband's was buttery. 2 perfectly good pieces of fish were ruined.  While I went to the restroom my hubby ordered a slice of keylime pie for me. The pie was delicious, our waiter was great, the people watching is extremely interesting, but we will never return here.",

The seafood here is pretty fresh and service is usually top-notch.    I'm not a fan of crawfish, but my friends always rave about it, so I gave it a shot. I played it safe and ordered the 1 1/4 lb option ($7.95) while they ordered 2.5 lbs ($15.90).  I ate about four of the crawfish and sorry folks, still not a fan.  The seasoning was too spicy and salty.  I ate the corn and gave the rest of the crawfish away.  I'll stick to crab, lobster or shrimp  - more meat.  I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake ($13.95) and shared an order of the P.E.I. mussels ($10.95). The crab cake was delicious - kudos to them for not skimping on the meat.  I was not a fan of mussels before Pappadeaux, but now I'm hooked and always order their P.E.I. mussels.    This place seems to always be packed, regardless of which day of the week it is.",

I always get the crawfish, always always. Always perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. Crawfish etouffee is amazing, tastes like a million bucks.

Mediterranean calamari is great, also crab cakes, oysters on the half shell...you get the point.      This place feels cajun and gets you in the mood with its ambience.

Even the kiddie meals were outstanding and they aren't shy on the portion sizes......This will definitely be my go to place when in need of supremely fresh seafood and steaks!!!",

My wife's was med-rare and she ordered well. It was quickly taken care of and corrected.   The service was excellent. Our waiter, Ed, helped make the evening a good time. He was efficient, but took time to chat and make sure it was a nice experience for us.   We like the way the restaurant is decorated to add to the experience. From the outside curb appeal, to the entry way, to the inside, you feel like you have left Phoenix and are in some New Orleans restaurant.",

I started with a Captain's Hurricane cocktail and it was very tasty. Then I had the andouille sausage and shrimp gumbo and it was fantastic - full of flavor aroma and perfectly cooked ingredients. My main meal was a platter of half fried crawfish tails and half crawfish ettouffe (sp), with a border of dirty rice in between. It was all so good and flavorful! Almost as good as I've ever had in Louisiana. My wife had the salmon topped with shrimp and crab. Normally she complains that the salmon is not just right or overcooked, but this time she said it was prepared perfectly. Finally we had the vanilla crew brulee and it too was as good as we've ever eaten.  We were glad that we enjoyed our meal outside on the patio since it seemed a lot less loud than the indoor dining areas. Our waiter, Brent was outstanding in his craft, and was pleasant to talk with. Our only complaint is that each course seemed at least 25% more expensive than it should have been. Next time in Phoenix we will stop again for hopefully another very satisfying dining experience.",

Finally my boyfriend went up to one of the young girls and she said \"oh, sure, we can seat you now\".  UMMMM WTF!!!!  What was the point of making a reservation if it wasn't even used to our advantage?  Complete BS.  The food, eh... it was so so.  We had a waiter who was CLUELESS.  He didn't know the specials, if there were even any.  We didn't get any bread, he said the oven wasn't working properly but mind you, people who were sat AFTER us were getting fresh bread..

I always order the same thing,Pasta Mardi Gras, and never could finish it before but this time there was less than half of the normal amount. Disappointing.  mY wife got the scallops and she got 3 tiny, tiny scallops for $25.  The last time we went the same thing happened but I chalked up to a 1 off. Overall, a very good place to eat but the last 2 times have been disappointing COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS 2 YEARS.  I may be unfair judging a restaurant by the amount of food given but spending $25 for a pasta dish, I guess I am used to copious portions.",

My boyfriend and I have taken his grandma here as well as my mom and I having dinner here on a different occasion.  The prices aren't cheap but either is the experience.  I'd say the only downside is it can get very loud at peak dinner times.  Every time we get a helpful server with an a+ attitude trying to make their guests enjoy their experience.   When we waited for a table at the bar with my bf and his gma- the bartender had the people's appetizer upgraded next to us so we could have some too!  I also love their margaritas and New Orleans inspired drink menu here- always starting the party with a frozen margarita or mai tai!  I enjoyed the Moroccan salmon and also had the naked salmon previously.  The kitchen has a tendency to serve broccoli raab with the naked salmon instead of green beans like the menu lists.  Broccoli raab is so gross and I do not recommend it!  Lastly the dessert tray is the real reason for my review!! Old school offerings on a tray always entices! Last time we had the pecan praline cheesecake (seasonal?) which is the most delicious thing ever.",

Our server Paul was phenomenal, he took care of all our needs and easily surpassed our already high expectations. We sat off the bar in an outdoor area. This was very comfortable and clean along with the rest of the restaurant. Having come here before, we had a decent idea of the quality and quantity to expect. We chose Pappadeaux for their quality of seafood in the past. Unfortunately, that quality was not there today in regards to the salmon that we were told would be cooked medium rare, arrived rare (a generous description). When Paul came to check on us, we informed him of the issue and he was very helpful, the manager then arrived who was nothing short of apologetic and helpful. She was eager to rectify the issue and ensure a happy customer, which she did. We will definitely be back",

We ordered the following: Shrimp and Scallop Orecchiette Pasta ($30) - It has shrimp, scallops, oreccheitte pasta, lump crab, asparagus in a creamy parmesean vodka sauce.  It was delicious.  The shrimp was huge, the scallop was rich and delicious.  Everything came very well together.  Grilled Redfish and Jumbo Shrimp ($34) - My colleague had this and it was fantastic.  I was able to taste the Redfish and it was flaky and delicious.  This is the dish my colleague always order.   Cup of Seafood Gumbo ($7): So good.  I asked for spicy and it definitely was not spicy.  I should have asked for extra, extra  spicy.  Lots of flavor with good pieces of sausage and seafood and rice.  When I'm in Phoenix again, I want to try their Crawfish Etouffee.",

The pasta had just the right amount of seafood and the desert trio was more than enough to share between two people or more.  Overall, a good dining experience with great customer service and good food.",

Last time in my wife ordered the shrimp and grits. Neither of us are huge on grits, but is sounded good for some reason. It is literally one of the best seafood dishes we have ever eaten. We have eaten seafood on the docks in SF, Seattle, and Juneau, so our opinions are not totally based on seafood in land locked states.",

Yep, the food was so good at lunch that I went back the same evening after a work dinner for dessert.  For those who aren't aware, this is a popular chain based in Houston. They feature Louisiana-inspired food and they do a great job!  I got the full po'boy and it was ginormous! I could barely finish it but I did. Everything was great: the flavor of the shrimp, the crustiness of the bread, the sauce.  And, as I said, I went back the same evening for dessert. Strangely, I don't recall what I had but I remember being please and glad I came back.  Lastly, the service was excellent. Our waitress--I had the same both times--was attentive and helpful when I vacillated over what to order.  Nota bene: I went to the restroom in the evening and this friendly older gentleman asked me what I thought of the food. Of course, I told him I liked it and we chatted for a few minutes. The gentleman just happened to be Harris Pappa, co-owner of the chain!",

    "text": "I have never been disappointed by the chain or this restaurant. After taking my folks here years ago, it became a \"must visit\" on their annual spring road trip to the Southwest. This year was no exception, even with a glitch in service.  The patio with water feature was perfect in April and we could talk at normal volume in contrast to the sometimes loud interior.  We placed two orders for grilled trout with shrimp and sauteed spinach and my mother ordered salmon with dirty rice. I got a mixed greens salad and my father got a beefsteak tomato salad with crab meat. The salads were excellent.  The fish was done just right and nicely presented. The trout plate was just the right amount, while my mother left some of the rice on her plate.  The one glitch was a mix up, missing my father's entree. As soon as the first two main courses came out, the waiter realized he had made an error. A manager showed up quickly to apologize, assure us they were fixing the problem, and offer a cup of chowder or bisque. My father took the lobster bisque and the second trout plate came out rapidly.   In the end, the bill showed that they comped my father's whole meal! Way to make things right. Again, we had a great meal with unrushed conversation on the patio. We will certainly plan on returning here and have a strong positive view of the brand.",

    "text": "Okay is a good summation of Pappadeaux. The food is good. Sometimes very good. But certainly not inexpensive, so for the price is SHOULD be good - arguably even better. A reasonable portion (about 6 ounces) of gator, for example, as an app is about $20. 3.5 ounces (medium vs. large) is $15. Is it good? Heck yeah, though with many of the smaller pieces, the gator taste is concealed by the fried batter flavor. But there's no value there.  The entrees are also quite pricey and again good, but not great. In my opinion, not good enough to warrant the prices. To be clear, when you set prices at a premium level the expectation is set deliver a premium meal. Good isn't good enough.  With all that though, both our orders were wrong and after waiting 45 minutes to get in and another 45 to get our entrees we took what we got. The bill adjustments were minimal and did little to reduce the grand total.  Would we come back? Perhaps if it was a special occasion and we wanted their food items specifically. But we eat out OFTEN and would not return for casual or even somewhat fancier dining.",

Having a toddler anywhere for more than 30 minutes can be a challenge but no one seemed to mind our walks to the lobster tank or outside to the fountain. The seafood was perfect (I ordered the shrimp and talapia plate for my son and I ended up eating most of it, it was so much food and so good!). Melissa, the manager, was personable and on the ball, and even offered to take a picture of our group. Pappadeaux is a large restaurant, many tables and seating options, but it nails quality service.

Very attentive and engaging!  Great customer service, and they really make the experience just that much more wonderful.  A waitress in particular comes to mind, which has served me over four times now.  Julia is her name, and she absolutely did a fabulous job! So so so many good things to say about her!!!  There are a few other waitresses that really have gone above and beyond in service.  Im terrible at names, and for the life of me, cannot remember the others.

I strongly advise everyone to order the fried gator. The roux served with this delicious meat makes me feel that I'm in New Orleans... The only difference is the spiciness. Nothing here is as spicy as True cajun food but still very good. The reason I am only giving four stars is that i am holding back because of the cost of eating here. Two people can get in and out with a couple cocktails for $100.  We celebrated my husband's birthday here recently... all food was great however with a party of 7 our bill was $300 and three were children. I believe there were 5 alcohol beverages on the tab... but still this is just too much for my liking.",

But, I had the opportunity to dine here tonight with my boyfriend for a nice dinner out. Since it's a Friday night, we did have to wait but decided a nice drink at the bar would be a good idea. The bar is pretty big and the bartenders are very friendly. Full service bar too so if you don't want to wait, that's an option. The couple we sat next to are regulars of the restaurant and raved about the food before we even sat down to eat. The restaurant itself is very vibrant and nice. The decor is a little outdated but still comfortable. You can dress up or be casual.  When we got our table, we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We were immediately served bread and continued to have great service throughout the night. If our waitress didn't get to us, there were many other staff available to get drinks, napkins, bring out food, etc. When I asked to sample the gumbo, they were more than happy to bring out a sample. It tasted great with the bread! I decided to eat light and went with the mussles whereas my boyfriend ate the mahi alexander. He loved it! Big portions but also a big price tag.   For good seafood, this place is amazing. They also have a nice outdoor patio and on a nice night, it's nice to sit out and eat. They also have a live band on the weekends too. Overall, this place is great and will definitely return!",

Her daughter and I made arrangements with the restaurant and were very gracious to help us out with the surprise. Since her mom had no idea she was here in state. What the restaurant did next was even a bigger surprise, all 7 military personnel and three of us as family members received a 50 percent discount off our bill. My hats off to them, any other place that I know of so far give 10 to 15 percent. What a great way to say thanks for service and support to our troops.",

Yes, this place is \"the Donald\" of rip off dining!!! The service was excellent. Marcus was friendly and most professional. But the food sucked. I tell you it was pitiful for the value. The martini glass was literally just half full. Pathetic. They should be ashamed of themselves, and for $10 per drink.   Granted, Im a Louisianan, thus a tough critic on any pseudo LA house beyond my home state. That said, I tasted the gumbo: watery, huge chunks of celery sparse proteins and just truly a joke. Campbells in the can puts this stuff to shame.  I opted for the halibut. Previously frozen, the piece was tough and the sauce devoid of flavor other than that of the overwhelming tablespoon of huge capers atop it.  In sum, Papadeauxs is a hands down sad imposter of Louisiana cuisine and so overtly overpriced its simply comical.  I had the halibut ($33), two puny martinis and a shrimp cocktail, the high spot of the meal, but whats is that, Ketchup and horseradish? Really??  My tab was $72.00!! Highway robbery. Do yourself a favor and head to Texas Roadhouse for a steak or Red Lobster if you must have seafood outside the state of Louisiana. Save the difference a few times then take a nice vaca to the Big Easy, treat yourself to Commanders Palace or Galitiores in the French Quarter. Your check will be identical but your meal superlative in every way.",

Our server was very attentive. We ordered the crab and spinach dip, our favorite that I feel I could eat bowls of like soup. My husband and I both ordered the crab finger dinner sauteed. Those crab fingers are delicious. The sauce they cook them in, which is probably made with a pound of butter on the dirty rice is a match made in heaven.

I ordered the lobster bisque and stuffed crab the Lobster bisque was super creamy hot and decadent ! The stuffed crab was full of delish delicate seafood and lightly fried. The seafood was fresh in both dishes.  I also ordered a cocktail that had fresh muddled raspberries and it was very refreshing. The turtle brownie sundae was amazing and also decadent. A great dessert for sharing.  Hope to see more locations pop up on west coast!",

Normally we take a booth but when they showed us they were in the bar, we changed to table.  The person taking us to the table took us to the first table we came to, near the door.   Umm.....not very nice for a first time here and a Bday dinner.  So we asked if there was another, and she snapped at us and said \"how about I follow you to the table\".   Okay now you are talking!  ;-) I didn't want her attitude to ruin our time.  We picked a table in the back near the windows, it was perfect, we could see the whole resturant and take in the atmosphere of the place.  We had the best time here!  Celebrating my husbands 60th Birthday.   We started with Alligator  appetizer which was fabulous!   We chose the trout and salmon.  Such great choices!  They were so good.   We both ordered a baked potato and it was so big we had left overs for two days.    ha ha    Our server was Jade....she made our entire visit the most pleasant of all!  Jade was the best host of Pappadeaux  and she knew her menu and details of it.   Jade, we couldn't of been more happy to have you serve us!  I would of given 4 stars due to the girl seating us, but Jade made this a 5 star visit!    Dessert was fabulous..... Key lime pie and brownie with fresh brewed coffee.

The parking lot was full and seemed very busy for a Tuesday night, we went in and was seated immediately.  I ordered the catfish and fried shrimp with red beans & rice.  This food was delicious! The fish was firm, hot, and crunchy; the shrimp was butterflied and crunchy as well.  Both had just the right amount of breading where you could taste the meat. It was very well seasoned.  The red beans & rice as also good, it was enough for 2 to share, the beans were cooked firm but not hard and were seasoned just right.  I will come back every time I'm in Pheonix",

Definitely a great dinner experience and customer care. The food is Cajun style and all freshly made.

Not sure why.  The place was full, but I don't see why everyone was shouting.  Weird.  Various dishes were ordered.  I was hoping for a Cajun catfish.  Breaded and deep-fried.  Sounded good.  Well, it was a disappointment.  It may as well have been Long John Sliver's.  There was no seasoning.  The waitress was nice enough to bring me some Cajun seasoning which I sprinkled on the fish.  It helped, but I think it would have been better if it was part of the coating instead of adding it later.  The other dishes ordered were better (I got to sample them).  So it's clear I just ordered the wrong thing.  However, I think it fair to deduct points for this.  Everything should be flavorful and exciting.  And the fried catfish just wasn't.  It's not a question of not liking something.  The catfish was cooked properly and tasted like catfish.  But there were no exciting flavors unlike the other dishes they offer.  Why did they do that?  I expect more than Long John Silver's.  I also got a bowl of gumbo.  It wasn't quite as good as I remember from last time.  it had a slight burned flavor to it.  Like maybe they cooked the roux too long.  But it was otherwise flavorful.  I'm still a fan based on the other dishes I sampled (and wished I had ordered).  I just won't order the catfish ever again.  I also had the key lime pie.  It was a bit too sweet.  I've never had such a sweet key lime pie before. The tart tang was there, but overpowered by the sweet.  Strange.  Maybe they assumed the raspberry sauce they drizzled on the plate would help counter the sweetness?  Don't know.  I didn't use the drizzle because I just wanted key lime.  Usually whipped cream is there to counter the tartness (and there was some).  But the pie was too sweet already.  I gotta deduct a few points for that too.  So I'll take one star away.  I can't really justify taking two from them.  I definitely expect better than what I got.  It's one thing not to like something, it's another when something you like isn't executed as well as it should have been.",

    "text": "We've been here several times and enjoyed the happy hour. We went for a dinner last week for my birthday and remembered why we hadn't gone for a full meal here in about five years. The food is fine, but overpriced. A small cup of gumbo is $9, which isn't worth it as it's just okay, not great, and it isn't like any gumbo I've had before. It's like vegetable soup with a few shrimp thrown in. It's the service that needs so much improvement. It was a busy night, and we we're shown to a table that didn't have any utensils or napkins. The hostess didn't notice, the server didn't notice and the person who brought our apps out didn't notice. With our food sitting there getting cold, I left the dining room where we were seated and went into the main room and found napkins and utensils on a table, and as I headed back, I ran into our server and told her that I'd come out to get our utensils myself. She smiled and said very cheerfully, \"Oh, that's fine!\" As if I'd been apologizing. By the time our meals came out I'd finished my cocktail and asked the person who brought our food for another and she said she'd get it. 25 minutes later, I'm done with my meal, and our original server walked by, saw my empty glass, and said, \"Oh yeah, I was suppose to put an order in for another.\" Says that to us, then runs off before I can say that I didn't want it any more. She brought it two minutes later and I drank half really quickly because we were paying for it, but we were done.",

    "text": "@ 6 pm on a Monday evening there was a fifteen minute wait. Seated and no server but Nick stopped and took our drink order and said he didn't know who had table. While Nick was getting drinks ( Beer and waters) another waiter put waters down probably seeing we hadn't been waited on. Nick went and took our table and I ordered a dinner salad with bleu cheese dressing ($4.75) and the chef specialty -  SHRIMP & SCALLOP ORECCHIETTE PASTA\rshrimp & scallops over orecchiette pasta with jumbo lump crab & asparagus in a creamy parmesan vodka sauce 29.95. The salad needed more dressing but was good. The pasta was VERY good with the three large scallops exceptional and three shrimp tasty. Just the right amount of food!",

Medium size. $15 for probably 10 pieces, a real joke!! The bread served is absolutely disgusting. Frozen, even ducks in the lake can t eat that. Took the tilapia. Good. Took the fresh oysters. 3 on 6 were eatable. The fried platter was super dry, with uncooked french fries. And finally the half chicken( not an half to be honest,) priced 22 dollars, yes 22 dollars, with side of spinach was undercooked. A huge disapointment for a 200 dollars bill. Will not come back again.",

    "text": "I have been waiting to post this review until after I got in touch with the restaurant to discuss my experience, and I finally have. I visited Pappadeaux for the first time last year after spring training and the food was wonderful. Everyone in my family loved it, and I insisted we go back this year after spring training again. We usually only spend one week a year in Phoenix, so choosing things to do and places to eat is very important as it costs a lot of money to vacation and we want to have a great experience (I promise this matters). It was our first day of the week in Phoenix when we ate here. I ordered the Costa Rican Mahi Alexander, and it tasted amazing. Unfortunately, a few hours after eating here I became very sick, and couldn't stop throwing up for 8 hours. I had to go to urgent care and get IV fluid, and was stuck in bed for a total of 3 days and unable to eat anything solid for the rest of vacation. I made Pappadeaux aware of what happened, and a representative from the restaurant called me to discuss my experience. She was very apologetic, which I appreciate (and why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1), but I am still disappointed in their suggested settlement of the issue. The total bill cost approximately $250 for the 5 people in our party, and they gave me a choice between $125 and a gift certificate to eat there again (why would I want to do that??). I took the $125, but it doesn't even begin to cover the urgent care, related medication, or lodging expenses for the vacation I was no longer able to enjoy. I'm upset to have missed out on the majority of this vacation, and hope no one has the same experience. I will not risk eating here again, which is sad because I used to like it so much.",

I decided to take it home not wanting to waste food.  After trying it at home, I threw it away because it didn't taste right.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that was very good.  The lobster bisque did not taste fresh.  It tasted old but the lobster pieces inside the bisque did taste very fresh.  I didn't feel well for the next 2 days after eating here.  I didn't feel better until I started taking a 'parasite cleanse'.  You would think a bill and tip for 2 that came out to be $139 would be a better experience.  Service was good this time.  Last time service was annoying.  We had a waitress that kept on insulting me the entire time and thought that was funny.  We both thought she was weird.  I went here 4 months before and the dishes were hit and miss.  The the fried calamari was stale tasting and tasted like a quick defrost of frozen food left too long in the freezer.  The Texas Redfish Pontchartrain was excellent.  One of the best tasting fishes in the Phoenix area.    The 2 star is really for the hit and miss on certain items and for food poisoning.  This is a shame because this was one of my favorite restaurant chain when I lived in Houston 20 years ago.",

    "text": "An east coast transplant now living in NoAZ, I miss seafood. And while in Phoenix during Mardi Gras week, I couldn't pass up the chance to sample some of the fresh seafood they say is flown in daily. I wasn't disappointed.  I had three appetizers so I could taste a few different things. The cup of gumbo was delicious and filled with various seafood and chorizo. The Oysters Duo, two different styles of broiled oysters with cheese was stupendous and fresh. And the shrimp & crawfish Fondeux with garlic bread was light and tasty. My drink, a new offering -- blueberry mule -- was great. And best of all was the service. My server was really pleasant, informative, helpful and really cared about my meal and experience.  A huge venue, the restaurant was packed and noisy. But for me, it was a good noisy as it was alive and buzzing with people enjoying themselves, and not so noisy that I couldn't enjoy my meal and evening.  The only reasons I didn't give 5 stars in my review where that the portions were huge. My appetizers -- the oysters and shrimp/crawfish dish -- could have each easily been shared by 2 or 3 people. And in part of the serving sizes and the price of fresh seafood in this part of the country, the prices were on the high side. As a single diner, I would have much preferred smaller portions or a tasting menu so I could have sampled and enjoyed more of their offerings. And maybe because of the size of the place and the number of diners, my dishes were served rather quickly but were on the more warm than hot side. I would have preferred them to be a little hotter when reaching the table. But overall, it was great and I will return.",

Tried it, expecting it not to be as good, since the Gulf is well known for its seafood, and Phoenix is not.  We received the exact level of quality in food and service.  Highly recommend this Restaurant  Have been back several times, and all have been fantastic until last Sunday. Waitress was obviously new, but without trainer.  Spoke very broken English and I knew she wasn't understanding order.  My wife ordered soup for app and crab and lobster salad for lunch.  I ordered one crab cake for app and pan seared talapia for lunch.  Even pointed to the dinner item so she wouldn't mix it up with what my mother in law ordered, which was the lunch grilled talapia.  Totally different dish.  First my crab cake came out.  10 min later my wife's salad came out.  I asked about her soup.  Waitress replied that she wasn't sure which she wanted first so she guessed.  2 minutes later the soup and our lunches came out.  I received the wrong lunch, as I expected.  She asked me if I wanted to change it.  Didn't feel like waiting, so I ate just the fish, but none of the sides.  The waitress just asked how everything was, even though my plate was barely touched.  She should have noticed, and not just smiled and took my plate.  At minimal, she should have sent the manager over to talk to us.  Figured she just wanted to cover her mistakes.  I am 3rd on regular check in's, so we will continue to come back.  Service was definitely not up to their norm.  Was not very busy at the time, so she was not rushed.  Just grabbed a to go order. Very efficient and super friendly. Heard that they were rolling out new training for take out. Everyone was enthused and seemed happy to be there. Thanks Pappa!",

After another 20 minutes we were finally seated.  When we did get to our table the table hadn't been wiped down.  It was dirty, trash(food) around the table, table was not set.  They finally came to wipe down the table. We waited another 5-10 minutes before we ordered drinks.  It took some time before the drinks came.  Typically, we get excellent service and this time was a huge let down.  At this time, we still had no silverware, no settings or anything at our table.  Bread came and it was cold, that is not typical.  The food came and it was mediocre, nothing screamed Pappadeaux, it was a huge let down, the food was luke warm.  Also typically you see a manager that comes around and we didn't see a presence of that last night.  I was very disappointed as this was one of my favorite restaurants as I drive a distance to enjoy the food and it was my daughter, niece and son's birthday.",

    "text": "Since my last review of Pappa, we've been back about eight times. In fact, six of those times were to celebrate my or my hubby's birthdays, which are two weeks apart. Last visit was last Saturday, the 8th; previous was Dec 26th. This review update could fit either visit.   Again- quoted 45-50 min wait, but vultured around the bar until a couple of seats opened up and dumped our table wait. It was CRAZY busy this time, with all of the folks in town for BCS, etc.   Oysters - wow. They were HUGE, delicious and showed up quickly. Our shucker even came by, after we were finished, to ask if we were happy with our order. Boy howdy, yes we were.   Hubby got filet mignon w/Alaskan King crab compliment; I got my usual crab cake on lemon-caper sauced crawfish bed (sweet potato garnish changed up to fried onion strings with a tomato-y relish on top, yum!). We were both 100% happy with the food. When I mentioned to our bartender (he gets his own paragraph) that it was hubby's birthday, he offered the normal comped dessert (key lime pie, MMMM), but threw in a bonus gift: the rum bottle token. It was appropriate; my hubby had sampled five different rum drinks during our meal. (Pirate Punch was my favorite!)   Ben was our bartender; he was just incredible!! Before we even got seats at the bar, Ben was asking what drink he could make for us. In fact, despite the extremely busy and loud atmosphere, his excellent and attentive service made it feel like he was our personal server - and I noticed that he was giving everyone around his end of the bar the same service. He is just that great! Or maybe he was just that happy that the Colts lost... :). Another 'tender, Kim, also kept a great eye on us and other nearby patrons, whenever Ben had stepped away. Our thanks to them both, for an absolutely fabulous experience which guarantees the future of our 3-year-old birthday tradition!",

My second and most recent visit was at the Phoenix location. The restaurant was very busy, even still our wait was under our quoted time, by only a few minutes. Everyone from the bartender to the server were all friendly and accommodating. The live music playing outside was an added benefit. Management was also outstanding. We had a challenge with the timeliness of our meal and the manager was very helpful in resolving our problem. The food was outstanding, with nice portions too. Flavorful, creative, and well presented are just a few attributes describing the food. Please consider Southern California for a future location!",

The third time I went here we had a party of about 15 for my mother in laws wedding, we called and made a reservation yet when we got there we still had to wait up front and we stood there for 40 mins! We had made the reservation days earlier. When we went to order they were out of half of the stuff we wanted so I orders the roasted chicken. I was disappointed it was so dry and tasteless. The 4th time was this past Monday, first of all they forgot my food so while everybody with me was eating I was just watching them waiting for my food, I wanted about 15 extra mins, second I was waiting for my server to refill my water almost every time it was gone, and the worst part about all of this.... I got the WORST FOOD POISONING from this place, I had to miss school on Tuesday and I'm missing work today. The only thing I have eatin in the past 32 hours is 3 fruit bars because that's all that my stomach will allow!!! Do not waste you're money at this overrated place, it truly is a waste of money and time, and if you do go here just know that you are taking a chance and you might get food poisoning and honestly I have had it before about twice but this is by far the worst case! DO NOT GO HERE!!!",

We decided to be a little adventurous and try out the Fired Alligator and Fried Frog legs. Both were extremely good. Since I am afraid to death of alligators it was a little self satisifing eating one! Now instead of looking at them as scary things, I see them in bite sized fried nuggets!  The Frog legs were equally as good. As the saying goes, tastes like chicken.  Dinner I had the Australian lobster tail. It was cooked perfectly! My wife had the tilapia laffayette thing, and it too was cooked perfectly. Nothing was overcooked or undercooked. They definately know what they are doing here cooking fish.  Waiter was prompt, courteous, and was johnny on the spot for water/tea refills. We didnt feel rushed at all, but we were definately in and out very quickly.  Would definatley visit again!",

My husband and son love the fried cray fish and my son loves the catfish.  Here is the thing - I don't think they take reservations so you have to just get there early.  Bar seating is limited or you sit outside so if they are crowded, you may have to wait.  It is very popular so often crowded.  But, it is worth the wait.",

I was focused on the people I was with, and had not really thought about what I was going to drink. The waiter was there to order, so I quickly looked over the wine selection and ordered what I thought was a simple glass of wine (left column number). It was one of the more expensive wines but was what I wanted since they were out of my first choice, Malbec. When I got the bill, I noticed that the wine was significantly more than what I had thought it was and asked about it. Turns out, there are TWO wine pours (5 oz and 8oz) and for whatever reason, he decided, without asking, that I needed the more expensive pour. I guess the lesson is, don't just assume that those 3 columns are glass/half carafe/bottle or whatever, get your magnifying glass out, read the small print and specify what you want. I have been to a lot of restaurants and have drank a lot of wine over the years, but this was a first for me and felt a little shifty in nature. I will very likely never be back.",

    "text": "With seafood cravings at an all time high, I had high expectations of Pappadeaux, I mean it has the word seafood in it's name after all ...  I came here for dinner with intentions of ordering oysters and possibly trying their other signature items I've heard so much about. Kind of gimmicky since it's has that themed restaurant feel, think Bubba Gump's, Red Lobster and the likes. It's dark and covered with seaside/fishing decor.  I went with a Watermelon Lemonade to sip on. A dozen Blue Point oysters and the Appetizer Trio to share. No entrees here as we knew this place does hefty portions. The service here is good and very quick, they refill waters with a quickness!  The Watermelon Lemonade was okay, just a lemonade with watermelon syrup and really sweet.  The Blue Point Oysters were good, though they came with horseradish, cocktail sauce, spicy soy sauce, and lemons, I was hoping they would at least have served it with a mignonette. The horseradish was okay, cocktail sauce too sweet and the spicy soy sauce was just plain wrong. I ended up eating the oysters with lemon and Tabasco. Nice and slightly more briny than the Pacific oysters that were also on the menu and had more of a bite to them.  The Appetizer Trio came with fried gator, Crawfish/Shrimp Fondeaux, and Smoked Salmon. To be quite honest, the fried gator is hands down amazing! I have never had gator and didn't expect it to be so juicy, tender and delicious. The sauce they serve it with is such a great pairing. The Smoked Salmon was juicy and cooked well, slightly smokey flavor. The Fondeaux tasted too strange for my liking, the shrimp tasted off, crawfish was a bit tough and the cheese for the Fondeaux did not pair well with the seafood and garlic bread.  This place is pretty pricey, appetizers go from $10-16 and the entrees from what I recall go from $25+   The only thing that was good about Pappadeaux was their fried gator, other than that I would have to pass.",

He said something about them being an aphrodisiac HA! I ordered baked lobster mac and cheese. We shared the Pappadeaux platter (1 pc catfish, 1 pc tilapia, extra shrimp, fried crawfish, 2 blue crab cakes, and french fries) and still didn't finish it. The shrimp and crawfish were too spicy for me my hubby loved it.   My dad ordered the fried catfish, red beans and rice plate while son ate grilled shrimp/grilled tilipia/broccolini and fries.   The desert presentation was the best. Although we were past stuffed, we tried to make room for the key lime pie and the humongous serving of vanilla cheesecake.  Overall, the experience wasn't horrible. We would def do it again.",

We live in Missouri but found this place when we came to Phoenix 6 months ago; thanks to yelp. The seafood is T-O  D-I-E  F-O-R!!! Brent even brought his father and brother when they came to Phoenix last month for a golf week. Raw oysters look amazing and are very popular!! They are shucked by Jose, a really sweet, attentive \"mother-shucker\". Don't forget to tip your shucker!! :)  Brent has gotten the crawfish etouffee all three times, and has LOVED it every time!! I got the small fried shrimp and then this time got the fried shrimp and scallops. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! While Pappadeux's appears to be a chain - we saw one in Albuquerque, we are lucky there isn't one in KC!! We'd be fat but happy!! Btw - my fried shrimp and scallops is not on the menu, but our awesome bartenders, Susan and Amanda, said it's not a problem whatsoever to do a fried combo, so they got exactly what I was craving. And it's beyond words!! And look at the size of the baked potato. Amanda/bartender said this was a small one. :/  Amanda and Susan worked their butts off at this large bar, but were extremely attentive despite the rush of people and drinks. They had awesome smiles and great, friendly attitudes!! The bar is where you get the best service!!! For those of you with larger parties, larger than Brent and I, there appears to always be large parties of 8-10 people that get seated quickly. Don't let the filled parking lot scare you off!!! Come - enjoy this place!! You will have a wonderful, YUMMY meal!! And - as the added bonus - they have Diet Coke!!! :). That's not why they got 5 stars, though!! :)",

Food was great, as usual, but the food service time was awful as they seemed to have lost our order (sat in the bar, which is normally great). Our oysters came timely but we sat for 35-40 min. after that to get our food.  Saw the bartender talk to one manager and she went to the kitchen to make things happen. After we ate, no consideration for the delay.  I asked to speak with the manager and a different one came up.  She apologized and said they didn't expect to be so busy (really, on Saturday?) and that the bartender was new. No real concern or consideration. Then asked if I would be back next Saturday(!). Hoping for a better experience next time.",

I inquired about the spiciness of the crawfish etouffee, and ordered it with a request to kick up the Cajun a bit. I've been craving for some good etouffee since a recent visit to a place in Bakersfield.  The crawfish etouffee was excellent, the portions are huge. My order was accidentally split in half, and each half was huge!   Yummy...  A freshly baked loaf of bread was delivered to my table.  Robert was a great server and did a great job! Thanks robert!",

There are a lot of great options here but some of my favorites are the catfish po' boy, fried alligator and crawfish boil. One must try appetizer are the sauteed frog legs. If you haven't had frog legs before this is a good place to try them.   They've got great atmosphere indoors, a great patio that typically features live music and the service is always fantastic. A fine choice for lunch ,dinner, drinks or all of the above.",

    "text": "Wow! What a great dinner and dining experience! We ordered the shrimp and crawfish fondeaux appetizer (which came with an awesome garlic bread loaf), Chilean sea bass (topped with jumbo lump \"crab gratin\"), and crispy Atlantic salmon (seared, topped with crab, shrimp & scallop), a cup of andouille gumbo, and finished with a house-recipe key lime pie.  Every dish was excellent, and the fondeaux lived up to all the Yelp hype. All of these items were at the recommendation of our young but very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and attentive server, Tory (you were awesome Tory and thanks for all the great recommendations). Our only regret is that it's taken us so long to finally try this place. We've passed it a thousand times, never realizing it had so much quality food and ambience (New Orleans flare). It's crowded, for good reason, so make reservations. - Mark & Rebecca",

    "text": "I usually enjoy a trip over to Pappadeaux but last night was the worst dining experience I've had in years. We were quoted a 10-20 min wait time... no biggie... ended up waiting 55 min to be seated. It is spring training and spring break so not a big deal because we did arrive at 7pm. The problem is we left at 10:30pm! I ordered the seasonal craw fish as an appetizer since I had an hour to look over the menu I ordered right away. Took 45 min to get the craw fish out and when they came there was an old dehydrated piece of corn with scraps of potatoes. I had watched other tables getting several pieces of corn with large potatoes so we must have been given the \"left overs\". It was truly pathetic. We ended up just getting the gumbo since we had already filled up on bread and my real motivation to eat here was the dessert. We ordered two desserts and after 15 min our waitress only brought out one (she forgot the other one). Our waitress was nice but just not good at her job. Every time she knew she messed up she would have the manager come to our table instead of just explaining to us what had happened. It was a long confusing $50 app, soup, and dessert. I would recommend going at 2pm for a stress free dinner!",

I was reminded again today at lunch having a seafood gumbo and half a shrimp po boy which could be a whole sandwich anywhere else. Dinner is also great but can get rather pricey especially for a chain. However despite of that, it's worth going back. Just save your pennies for your next taste treat.",

    "text": "Last night my husband and I had a horrible experienced! I met him and a friend there for dinner.  They were having a glass of wine in the patio when I got there.  We went inside for dinner.  Angela, the waitress came and asked the guys if they wanted more wine. I had to ask her if I could have a drink!  She came with drinks and we ordered alligator.  Alligator came and no bread, had to ask for it.  Our dinner came, friend was served. We ordered mussels.  The guy tried to pour them out of the pot and they were stuck in the pot!!  Both pots!!!..He said that wasn't good and would get new.  In the mean time Angela came out to tell us she was sorry and asked if we were done with the Alligator (2 left) and she actually had her fingers on them while she was talking to us!!!  I couldn't believe my eyes, also asked if we were done with the bread (with her fingers on the towel the bread was wrapped in).  All this time she was coming out to talk, she sounded  like she was reading from a book or something, slow and not saying anything worth anything. Was also watching people wiping off tables, very slow and really not liking what they were doing.  Get another job!! We have been here a lot and have seen workers fast and doing their job.  Busy and getting things done.  And the food was excellent.  But what has happened?  They should look around and maybe clean house!  The table next to us had a  big serving platter with dirty dishes and left over food next to them thru out their dinner and we had our appetizers next to us thru most of our dinner. The manager finally came out to say she was sorry also, I think it was the kitchen and waitress that was the problems here.  Alligator was very chewy, the mussels were like they were just cooked in water and had no flavor.  We have brought our out of town guests and family here and have always had a wonderful experience, but this time I don't know what went wrong. We will think twice the next time.  I think they are having issues with cooks and workers!!!",

I have had 3 separate experiences that just weren't up to par (1st time was a pick-up order & the steak was extremely chewy 2nd time was similar to my experience I had on Sunday.) I went to have dinner with my boyfriend and  we were promptly seated, but that is where the promptness ended. When we finally received our food (both had the seafood sampler for somewhere around $21 per plate) and everything tasted similar without any of the WOW factor I was hoping for. The worst part was when we were done eating the waitress brought us our to-go boxes and then took 30 minutes to bring us the check. We debated on just leaving but decided to be responsible, but lets just say the tip was minimal. Overall this place just wasn't worth my $64 bill at the end of the night. I ended up having a BOMB dinner the next day at Jason's Dell for $20 and I enjoyed it WAY more! nuff said",

I keep coming back because I love the king crab legs and the lobster tail; haven't found another place that has them along with a decent array of other food in a lively atmosphere, but they don't inspire me with confidence considering I always spend over $100. My partners always end up with poor meals.   First of all, their seating management is a disaster. On Friday's visit, I first called for a reservation - 9:30pm was the earliest offer.  I drove there anyway, arrived at 7:30pm, put in our name for a table for two, outside (new system in place - no more numbers, but vibrating alert gizmos).  I asked for outside, but she said 'let us know that when you are called' - probably the problem right there. We were told '20-30 minutes'.  No problem, we went to the smaller bar next to the outdoor dining patio and had a beer.  The Patio was 30% full only, and the waiters servicing the outdoor patio were standing around idle. After watching the patio remain largely empty for at least 20 minutes, I approached the front desk and asked, 'how come we aren't being seated since the patio is not full?\" She immediately grabbed a couple of menus and seated us.  We later asked our waiter what was going on, he said ...'million dollar business with a couple of high-school kids running the front desk'.  Just about sums it up!   We also got dripped on and generally over-chilled by the misters and fans. We finally asked for them to be turned off, but it took a good 20 mins for the misters to completely 'dry out' (one of the reasons I want to sit outside is to avoid the over-chilled interior).   I had the lobster tail, it was great. My partner had the 'hudson bay combo' ... the bacon-wrapped shrimp were great, but the lobster tail and the scallop were totally lukewarm, tasting like they were cooked well in advance.  Not good for a $27 entree.",

They should definitely invest in a different bread recipe, I like soft bread! I ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it costs 10 dollars. The shrimp cocktail tastes good but it is very small in portion and not worth the money! The waiter recommended a jumbalya type of dish and it was around 23 dollars. It was big in portion and tasted good. My fiance got filet Mignon and she said it tasted good except the sauce wasn't very good. She asked for a salad to substitute the asparagus and the waiter said he couldn't. The asparagus comes the size of tree trunks lol. The bill totaled about 70 for two people. I would say that the food tastes good but it is over priced. The waiting staff was very good as well. The reason for the 3 stars is the over priced food.",

The front desk clerk at our hotel (which was conveniently walking distance) recommended this restaurant to us.  When we arrived the hostess told us it was going to to be an hour wait.  Rather than drive (or go to Fridays) we decided to stick around.  My father sat down and I went to the bar to get a couple drinks.  Albeit the bar was busy but the bartender, Mitch, asked me twice what I would like and then completely ignored me and never got them.  I waited for 20 minutes before Linda came and asked me for my drink order and promptly took care of it.  When two seats became available at the bar she quickly suggested we jump on them.  We ended up having dinner at the bar and everything was wonderful.  At Linda's suggestion we tried the Mediterranean calamari which was outstanding.  For our entrees we had the bacon wrapped shrimp and the scallops.  Both were delicious.  And Linda was simply amazing. She made up Mitch and made our evening wonderful.

We each ordered something extremely different from the other and all you heard was the sound of us chowing down.  One colleague got a salad which she devoured...said it was fresh, not too little/much dressing, etc.  My other colleague ordered the crab legs and she loved every last bite...tore it all up.  I ordered a tuna dinner item...don't remember the name...but it was a special item they had that evening and it was divine.  The mashed potatoes were so fluffy...loved it all.  I also ordered the banana pudding for dessert and was a complete pig...and ooooMG was it worth it.  It was layered so well and served in a keepsake mason jar...very cute.  Anyhow, it beat my mom's banana pudding which is one of the many foods I would eat before death...!  SO, I couldn't believe how delicious everything was.  Additionally, the service was SUPER prompt and the young woman who was our server was extremely courteous and efficient.  Would definitely return again!",

When craving seafood I'll swing by for one of their seafood platters and it definitely takes care of my craving.   Love their margaritas, and most drink options.

If you are a foodie and love exploring this place is a must! Like a top 5 places to visit- it's that good!!!   I live in California and have been making trips to AZ for the last two years and had wished I went here sooner. The establishment is huge so even on a Saturday night around 7pm we only had a 15 minute wait for a party of 3! I know jaw dropping right???   Then the food- amaze balls!! There wasn't one thing I was disappointed with, well actually there was. The only disappointment was that I couldn't eat more! There were so many more things I wanted to try but I could barely finish my meal! We had the mozzarella bites as a starter and they were light not oily or over fried! I'm not a huge fan of marinara sauce but theirs was the bomb! I had a cup of lobster bisque- heaven!! For the main course I had the shrimp creole with grits and the worst thing was that I couldn't finish it- but what I did eat was A+++ Now just because I was full and probably ate the equivalent of 3 days calories here was no way I was leaving and not getting dessert- creme brulee it was, to go but still was delicious!   Service was on point and I will make sure anytime I go back to AZ to stop here again because there are so many options on the menu I need to try more things!! Oh and the drink menu is also amazing!",

Love the fire lanterns that remind you of a turn of the century New Orleans street lamp. Our server was very knowledgeable and she was excited to share her favorites/inputs. Everyone in our group loved their food but for the sake of time I'll just stick with mine. I decided on the crab cake appetizer as an entree and it was incredible. Three large crab cakes I could only tackle two of them. The fresh crab inside was huge chunks with a fantastic seasoning on the outside. The sauce they had underneath them had a subtle zest to it, just enough to compliment the fresh crab. I added a loaded baked potato and it was gigantic filled with heart clogging deliciousness. Definitely going to be a second meal tomorrow!",

The Beans that were supposed to be cold, were now warm. Obviously the staff didn't re-create our plates, just reheated them. The Manager came to our table and offered a Desert, we declined.

She did not inspire confidence in her knowledge of the menu when we asked questions. Waitress did not seem to have a sense of urgency at all. Food was ok, but the service made the experience less pleasurable. Had the live Maine lobster. Server asked if we wanted dessert and we ordered. First two things requested were sold out. She said maybe she should start by telling us what they did have, lol. She then went and got the dessert tray and went through the available options. I've been here many times and more and more so the food and service have been hit or miss.   UPDATE: Received a response from Felicia with Pappadeaux. Said she wanted to make it up to me. I responded and she never got back to me. It's too bad. I really wanted to give it another shot as she requested. Disappointed further...",

I have been here a handful of times and it has never disappointed me. The atmosphere, the waiters and food bring this place to perfection.   Chowder is a must and the calamari appetizer plate is my favorite. But the Caribbean lobster has topped all the dishes I have tried!!   The plates are huge so come here hungry! And yes the prices are not low but well worth it for the quality of food.  This place is perfect for anniversaries, dates and birthday celebrations.   Ohhh!! Let's not forget the dessert menu!! They bring over every option the have so you can decide.  My favorite is the cheesecake but the cream brulee is equally good!",

    "text": "My husband wanted to take me out for a really nice lunch that isn't too far from our house so he picked Pappadeaux since I enjoy eating fish. I went with the Creole Caesar salad with blackened Salmon.  Short story - is that for $24.95 I expect a Caesar salad to be made with  Properly Made Caesar Dressing and I didn't receive that.  Long story-   In reasonable time I received a large salad with a generously sized piece of salmon. It wasn't very blackened but was prepared reasonably well. My issue here is that the house made Caesar Dressing was a loose white almost tasteless dressing that isn't Caesar Dressing. I'll be honest and mention that when I pay $24.95 for a Caesar salad I expect a properly made Caesar Dressing made with anchovies, garlic, an egg yolk, oil, lemon, Worcestershire (some wine vinegar) parmesan and black pepper. Those ingredients make a delicious flavorful dressing that I was expecting instead of all that I received a very bland almost tasteless dressing on my salad. I think guest should be warned that Pappadeaux does not serve Caesar Dressing and serves something else for a Caesar style salad. The other part of the salad that I don't understand was the creole roasted tomatoes. I received delicious roasted tomatoes but noting on them made them creole...they were just roasted. Other than all that the salad was good.....not great like it should be but good. Not bad enough to complain or send back. It was a nice big salad with a nice piece of fish. It just wasn't a Caesar salad....just Caesar style.  All went well with the Grilled Shrimp and Andouille Sausage. That is a great dish and is a great value for $18.95.  I was hoping I'd love the Key Lime Pie. For my taste and my husband's taste it lacked lime flavor and had an off-putting jello-ee texture. (but that is our taste and not everyones) However the crust was delicious and spiced nicely.  Our waiter was as sweet as can be and seemed very well trained on the menu.  A-ok means A-ok it doesn't mean to avoid it means basically good but I have some reservations.",

Been around the globe numerous times, eaten at some amazing places, but PPD's is absolutely a must go to, in the Phx area. Please soak up the other reviews as many here put great verbiage and flavor into their reviews so I won't do that here in duplicity.   It's the restaurant my wife and I will travel to as a sure-win, delicious, always busy, always friendly and palate pleasing to the max location! It's now our interim stop from Tucson to Flagstaff every 3 months... Never, in two decades have I walked out with a dissatisfied meal, no matter the party size I've brought in. They do it right, they're attentive, the food is perfect and realistically, priced right. Can you identify another area to get excellent alligator - in the desert?? See my point?! I'm also a fan of their Blackened Catfish and even their scallops are tasty. The crab and lobster are always on point and your drinks never seem to get to the bottom of the glass because the drink fairies are always floating around eyeballing your tables.   For any and I mean ANY negative reviews on here, I seriously question if they properly or adult communicated the issue or they're just beyond too darn picky...LOL.  Zero complaints. Love it. You will too!  Cheers.",

And when a place is this huge and still packed (there was an hour wait...thank goodness we had a reservation!) then you know that there has to be something special to it.  And considering there aren't that many places here in the Valley to get authentic Cajun cuisine, this makes it all the more special to check out.  And boy...did we indulge! Here's what we had:  Appetizer: Alligator bites - breaded, fried and incredibly tender. Comes with a cajun dipping sauce that I wanted to smother everything in. This was my first time trying alligator, and based on this experience, I am officially a fan.  Second course: 2 soups (because one was clearly not enough, lol). We had the Gumbo and the Lobster Bisque. The gumbo was good, but the lobster bisque was clearly the winner in this battle. It was creamy, had nice chunks of lobster....would definitely order this again.  Main course: Redfish with lemon caper sauce. The fish came out spice rubbed and ready for a good time. It was cooked perfectly, and the lemon caper sauce was seriously kiss the chef good. We demolished this.  Dessert: Banana pudding - this isn't something I'd normally order, but the waitress recommended it so we gave it a shot. The pudding was so light, had chunks of banana and something else delicious inside of it. It was a great way to top off an already amazingly indulgent meal.  To wrap it up: eat here. You won't regret it ;)",

Food has lost its personal touch in regards to presentation, flavor, customer service and the obvious the cleanliness of the restaurant.  My advise to management is to take the time to turn on all the lights and move the tables and chairs and really clean the floors.  Your counters, your trims, the fixtures and frames on the walls are dusty and dirty.    Very disappointed how much this place has fallen.  I would have my business meetings during the week and family and friend gatherings here all the time on the weekends but not the case with all the bad experiences I have had these last few visits.    Sorry but your prices are not worth my return, also can you please tell your staff everyone should buss tables.  If your heading to the kitchen take something with you.  How can you encourage me and my guest to have dessert and coffee when I have dirty dishes sitting in front of me for 15-20 minutes after we have finished our dinner...    Sorry but you are not what you use to be.  Still regret not sending my King Crab back to the kitchen when I have to pay 65 plus or so for crab that is over cooked and chews like a piece of gum before even being able to swallow, by the way we had three king crab orders at our table that night and all were over cooked.    I recommend the GM takes a good look around and really take a step back and fix these issues.",

Really enjoyed my shrimp and grits.  My son enjoyed his plate of fried seafood and we both had plenty to bring home leftovers.  They offer kids meals and my friend enjoyed the gumbo.  There was only one negative to the trip.  My daughter (12 years old) accidentally stepped out of the car with her reusable coffee cup from home.  By the time we realized we were already walking in and it is HOT (getting to be summer in AZ) and we were all hungry.  We told her she shouldn't do that but proceeded into the restaurant.  At the hostess stand we were informed that she couldn't have the cup and that they could throw it away.  Instead of walking all the way back to the car or having the cup tossed she went outside and placed it on an out of the way table, to be picked up on the way out of the restaurant.  We weren't seated but a few minutes and an employee holding the cup walked to our table.  We were told the cup can't be out on the table because it might be thrown away (this was a risk we were willing to take).  At this point we walked it all the way back to the car.  It was just a silly damper on an otherwise very enjoyable meal and experience.  The cup could have been placed in my purse for goodness sake.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue but much needed. I would like to start off by saying this was by far the worst Pappadeaux that I have dined at this far and I've been to quite a few of them across the United States. This past Mother's Day my family (party of 16) wanted to attend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen for the special occasion. From the beginning I didn't have a good feeling because we were unable to make a reservation. We were told to just show up. So we showed up and ended up waiting for an hour and fifty three minutes. They did have people walking around serving drink, sausage, and cheese which was cool but still didn't make up for the almost 2 hour wait. Anyway, we finally get seated and are greeted by our waiter right away who was really nice by the way. Everyone gets their drinks and being that we were such a large party we needed extra time to decide on an order. Eventually everyone is ready but we ended up waiting another 20 minutes before anyone came back. So everyone finally places their orders and the food actually comes in a decent amount of time but it was terrible. My husband and I both ordered the seafood platter. Mine was burnt and it tasted like my husbands had been deep fried in old grease. My moms salmon was ordered well done and was frozen in the middle. My mother-in-law had to send her po-boy back because it was burnt. I understand that it was very busy this day but I don't feel like the lack of food preparation was acceptable, especially for the price that we ended up paying for everyone to eat. Needless to say my family and I didn't have a good experience at this Pappadeaux location.   -Ashley",

More subdued happy hour. Good prices but a little more quiet. The restaurant is clean and well kept. Problem I have is the portions continue to get smaller and smaller but the prices never change. I understand market value, but cutting portions into half and keeping the steep price seems a little disingenuous. Really my only issue is the price to portion here. Everything else I love.",

Came on a Tuesday and had the fried and blackened alligator for appetizer and the crawfish etouffee. The alligator was well cooked and flavored. The etouffee was very disappointing. There were bits of shell left in the etouffee and the flavor was not great. Not able to get rid of the muddy flavor from the crawfish either. Maybe stick with the fried stuff, although for a nice establishment, just sticking with the fried stuff is sad. I would give it 3.5 stars but no half stars available.

    "text": "I didn't post this from a few months ago, but we should have. My wife and I called In reservations and arrived 15 minutes early. We waited an hour and a half after our reservation to be seated. So a total of 1 hour 45 minutes. When we were seated the staff made an extra table close to the restrooms as they were very busy, they then set another table so closely to ours that when I turned around I sat cheek to cheek with the couple that they seated there. They complained,  we complained the other couple was moved and the table remained for the next guests. The second table wasn't moved, Neither of our two groups were accommodated this time and the waiter became noticeably agitated. We gave up, ordered two drink each and waited for our server to return. As we attempted to order appetizers he left our table to attend to a larger group, returned and said\" ok, ready for your check\"? I was floored. We paid for our drinks, paid  for drinks and apps for the second couple as I was now noticeably agitated, our night was ruined and I didn't want to ruin theirs and we left after speaking to the front desk. We were assured a manager would call but not a peep. So to re-cap we spent $215, no food, no apps, no call from management. We have four children so that time out is special to us. We went back last weekend, same attitude, same service at the bar as last visit. We left before being seated and went to desert ridge. We won't be back any time in the near future.  What's worse is the company I work for routinely has management dinners and we usually get great food and are treated well.   It's shows that the service you receive is based on the amount your parties table is worth.",

It took a loooong time for a single glass of wine, ordered with the meal. Hubby ate his entire wntire appetizer, and still we waited. Marcus told me 3 times it was coming, and still i waited.

Anyway, the portions are alright and I loved the crispy alligator plus several types of lobster tails. The only one dish I didn't like was a dish that contains rice, two pieces of sausages, and a baked potato (I think). The sausages were too soft and soggy. They ran out of cheesecakes when I wanted to order. But the creme brulee was good. The prime rib was huge (I mean for that price it better be). The margaritas were great and there were four types of margaritas. I didn't like the Swampthing too much. We ordered like 10 batches of oysters. My favorite was a sea bass dish. The fish was soft and melt in your mouth. It's covered in a creamy and buttery white sauce. The service is great!",

I saw too many employees either standing around doing nothing or running around looking like their heads were cut off. This place very disorganized.  They were out of too many items to boot! The food very salty and overpriced. The plates, too big for  small table for a party of 4. Come on people, this is a sit-down restaurant. I could make better food at home and be comfortable!To top it off we were overcharged for an item that was not ordered. Always check your itemized receipt! This place is a disappointment. Very embarrassing for what was supposed to be a special night for taking the in-laws out for dinner.",

Always pleasant staff, I have eaten here in passing for a drink and snack at the bar, for lunch, as well as for dinner. Never a bad experience.   A must have is the Deep Fried Alligator appetizer. Very appetizing and tasty, no off or gamey flavor at all.   Also, the cheese sticks here are the best I have ever had, more like cheese logs. These have the lightest and crispiest fried crust you will ever have.   Other dishes to try are the Crawfish Etouffee as well as the Pasta Mardi Gras.   The only downside at this location is that it can get a little noisy when it gets busy.",

    "text": "I would like to extend a formal apology for not walking into this place sooner. It honestly blew away all my expectations! The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all absolutely wonderful. Our server was Brent and he was fantastic; sweet, quick, and very polite and happy.  It has been a while since I've set foot in this place. Not because of any slight or grievance on my part, but because of a long string of bad luck. This place is not for people looking to save money, but if you're tired of being practically robbed at your local Red Lobster, you might want to give this place a try. Better options on the menu, infinitely better quality, just at a little higher price, but to me the price was worth it. Started with the calamari appetizer. Delish! Extra points for the fried artichoke hearts. Entrees were the Pasta Mardi Gras (for me) and the Scallop & Crab Pappardelle Pasta. Good lord was the Mardi Gras good. Actually grilled shrimp (instead of browned shrimp dowsed in liquid smoke), crawfish (I know it's lazy on my part but I was so happy they had already just put the meat of the crawfish into the dish instead of placed whole ones in; I'm clumsy by nature so I would have made a mess), and andouille sausage (which I've never tried before but found I liked it greatly) all in a marinara creams sauce (my favorite). I highly recommend this dish because I couldn't find one fault (not that I go looking, but the other seafood restaurants near me always manage to somehow magnify their faults when I visit so it's hard not to just expect mistakes). I wish I'd had room for desert because I'm sure it would have been wonderful, but then again it gives me an extra reason to come back. Please don't be scared of the prices because in my mind it's completely worth it due to everything backing the prices up. This is a great place for once in a while special occasion type outings! Especially for people who are fed up with the subpar seafood most places like to tout out of their kitchens!",

Finally took our drink order and then took close to another 15 minutes to deliver our iced teas and take our entree order. Checked on us once late in the meal. Which is unfortunate because we did need a few times after our entrees were delivered but were never offered additional service. Empty tables all around us. During our meal a family of 5 was seated next to us. I heard the father say \"I can't believe we waited 20 minutes to be seated here when it was open the whole time. Maybe if you 4 hostess girls didn't gather around the podium and chat we would have been seated quicker.\" This gives you an idea that several customers were unhappy by the service provided by the restaurant employees. The food is delicious. The prices are high. The service is poor. Now it's you that has to decide if it's worth experiencing. As for my husband, mother-in-law, and I....probably won't return.",

The seafood gumbo was tasty and they didn't skimp on the seafood.  The Pappadeaux Platter was a huge plate of various fried seafood on a bed of french fries.

In town for some Harley riders fun so we knew this place was going to get crazy crowded, like Vegas Buffett crowded. So as soon as we arrived on Friday we decided to hit this seafood sanctuary early afternoon. YES best decision EVER. We heard the wait time for the whole weekend ended up being over an hour and a half, not for us, not for the trio that has been waiting on this moment since 2012. After we gave them our phone number so they can text us when our table was ready, we walked around to find a seat to wait and as soon as we sat down DING..... The doorbell to foodie heaven rang, literally a 2 minute wait. Okay so now we're headed to our table and I'm scoping the place out left to right up and down all around, this place is HUGE. Fun decorations, big window to see the chefs in action, lobsters in tank, dessert trays, bar popping, patio popping, plates piled with fish, waiters trying to keep a fast pace through the crowd, and lots of happy people. The drinks are fruity and strong, bread n butter on point. Their menu is extensive so it took us awhile to order. I ended up with the seafood platter, hubby had catfish fillets, my ride or die girl had the salmon. People talk about how pricey this place is BUT the portion  and the freshness of the seafood was stellar. We all had enough food left over for another meal. The lump crab cake is just that lump crab delicious. Stuffed crab was perfection. Fish was fried just right and the dirty rice was excellent. I can't wait to return next year same time same place, we will be there because I was checking out the king crab legs and they are now on my radar.",

I find that if you get their specials, or fish with a sauce topped with crab and shrimp or crawfish you can't go wrong.  The Calamari has always been really good too!",

The vibe of Pappadeux is unique with families, couples, and large groups all appearing to have a good time.  I had grilled shrimp with sauteed green beans and my. oh. my... was my mouth was happy!   Last note:  I never have dessert. The dessert tray was toO unique to give it a pass. The King cake cheesecake was to die for.  you should order that!",

    "text": "We went here for happy hour and enjoyed the fried alligator and great sauce. The shoestring potatoes on the side were crispy. I've been trying to eat healthy when I go out, so based on the description on the menu, I ordered the Greek salad and added crab for an extra $7.99 for my entree. Although it says \"prepared at your table,\" they brought it to me already dressed, the lettuce was literally drowning in the vinaigrette and limp, and there was maybe a tablespoon or two of small pieces of crab on top. The salad had no cucumbers, but had green peppers, which is unusual. A Greek salad always has cucumbers. As I stirred my salad around so I could get a little bit of everything in each bite, the crab basically disappeared and I only saw a couple of Mediterranean olives. The feta was on the light side also. I mentioned to my waiter that my salad was not what I expected and a manager showed up a little while later. I told her my concerns, including paying $8 bucks for the little bit of crab, and very few olives or feta cheese. She told me the salad had 2 ounces of crab and three olives. Excuse me, but if you figure that out, they are charging $64 a pound for crab!! It wasn't even lump crab, and basically disappeared into the salad so I felt like I didn't get any. The green salad was $12.95 and adding the  $7.99, I could've gotten a full entree for that price ($21). She did offer to bring more olives and feta, which I accepted - however, the $8 worth of crab that I couldn't even taste was my biggest complaint. I was very disappointed in my meal, felt it was overpriced, and was still hungry when we left.",

The food was MUCH better than our miserable experience in March.  He enjoyed the shrimp po' boy and seafood gumbo (he kindly gave me some of the gumbo, including a gigantic oyster, which I thoroughly enjoyed).  I ordered the lunch Blackened Catfish with Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette and Dirty Rice.  The catfish was sweet and tender and oh so yummy.  The Shrimp Etouffee Pistolette was a dish of their outstanding Etouffee with a hunk of French bread so decadent, I think they actually dunked it in melted butter and then deep fried it (Texas State Fair anyone?).  I saved some of the Etouffee and cooked plain wild rice to go with it for lunch on Monday.  The dirty rice was once again delicious, so happy they use ground chicken livers, as it should be.",

I wasn't so sure how the whole experience would go since I don't usually eat fish and I haven't had a lot of experience with cajun food either.  But my hesitation quickly slipped away as the ambiance of the restaurant engulfed me.  This is a fun place.  It was a busy night and so we had cocktails and appetizers on the patio--great patio!  As our table came available, we were escorted inside to nice location by the window.  (I love tables with a view.)  Our waiter was very helpful with the selections explaining in detail which dishes would suit our individual tastes. Nice variety of dishes on the menu.  My ceasar salad was was as nice complement to the shrimp etouffee and dirty rice.  Everything was spiced just right and the favors were just watering.  Our waiter checked back on us periodically, just enough to keep in touch but not be a bother.  He was attentive and concerned that his dinner suggestions met with our approval--they did.  He was very good and I wish I could remember his name, to give him a proper shout out.   Needless to say, I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix---Love you, Pappadeaux's!",

    "text": "I hope this was an isolated incident, because I really love Pappadeaux's.  It's not someplace I go regularly, rather reserved for special occasions. It's a little on the pricey side but certainly in line with the usual value they offer. The food, service and ambiance have always been top-notch and I've been saying for weeks now that it's where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner.   Despite the fact that they're a chain (huge in Texas and elsewhere, but only 1 single location in Phoenix), I feel like they operate like an indie and get it right on most fronts.  My favorite dish is the Crawfish Platter (a ginormous platter piled high with authentic dirty rice in the middle, flanked by breaded, fried crawfish on one side and thick, savory crawfish etouffee on the other side).  Last night's birthday dinner was unfortunately an absolute bust.  I was excited to show my boyfriend the amazing wonder of Pappadeaux's, as he'd never been there before and I'd been talking it up for weeks.  We were seated right away (which was atypical because they're always packed), but we did get an annoying end table right on the corner so there were constantly people pushing past us and bumping into my chair.  Whatever, luck of the draw, and I was happy to be seated right away.  Our server Erich came over and took our drink order.  I ordered a Coke and water.  I got Diet Coke, which tastes like poison.  Waited a few minutes trying to flag him down (admittedly this guy had at least 2 other tables he was waiting on) and I pointed that out to him and he launched into some weird back and forth about how it should be Coke.  You're tellin' me buddy, that's WHAT I ordered.  He took it away and a different server brought me a regular Coke with a smile.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Then Erich returned and babbled awkwardly about the mishap. It's fine. This happens a lot. Most people drink Diet Poison - I get it.   He took our orders and said he'd be back with some bread.  The bread and butter was dropped off pretty quickly, which is when we realized we had no set-ups.  It's kinda hard to spread butter on your bread without a knife.   We waited a few more minutes looking for him to flag him down again.  He grabbed set-ups for us and said something about \"I wish we could assure that all tables could have set-ups when they're bussed but that's nearly impossible...\"  Ok, whatever, I just want utensils and a napkin.  Thank you.  The food this time was OK.  Normally it's stellar. Maybe I was already annoyed by what I considered \"Strike 1\" and \"Strike 2\".  Both crawfish entrees were great.  The dirty rice was definitely subpar --undercooked and very dried out/chewy.   Erich asked us if we needed anything. I asked for an extra tartar sauce and a spoon for my etouffee.  He brought them right over.  At that point, at the beginning of the meal my Coke was still full. Like most people, I drank it intermittently while I chewed and ate and it was soon gone, but I still had half a plate of food to eat.  No sign of Erich.  No Coke in my glass. So I just continued eating and finished my plate.    At the end of the meal, Erich re-appeared and asked if we needed anything.  My other half motioned at my glass but at that point my food was gone and I just wanted to leave.  Erich then realized that maybe I wanted a refill and asked if I did. I said don't worry about it and asked for the check.  Then we waited some more.  The check came and I swear to you the fastest thing I saw the waiter do all night was process the check and get us out of there.  What bugged me was that I could see many other tables around us being served and having a great time with their servers, lots of smiles, hospitality and ambiance. I felt like we got the shaft.  I have to say that in the past I've always had impeccable service, amazingly fresh food and a top-notch experience at Pappadeaux's.  Perhaps this was an off night.  Perhaps Erich had too many tables.  Perhaps we shouldn't have even left him 10% gratuity.  Three dings on service, one on food and one on the crappy table.  I'll have to think long and hard before spending my money there again.",

That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.   It is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good. The atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends.",

    "text": "We tried to make reservations about an hour ahead of time but they were booked up for reservations.  But not all tables can have a reservation.  So we decided to just go anyway and were seated right away.  The place is huge and has more tables than I could count.  The bar area is also very large with many booths and tables.  The menu had so many choices it was hard to decide.  So many cajun dishes too.  Our appetizer was shrimp cocktail.  It came with 9 shrimp instead of the usual 6 served at most places.  The cocktail sauce had a half teaspoon of straight horseradish sauce for those who may want to kick it up a bit.  We prefer less kick and dipped around the sauce.  It was a great way to start the meal.  My wife and I split a small order of fried shrimp (8). It was served already split in separate plates which was nice. The shrimp were butterflied, light and crispy, delicious.  She also ordered the stuffed shrimp and a baked potato loaded.  The shrimp were rolled in a rich crab stuffing which was seasoned perfectly.  The baked potato was huge, hot and smothered with all kinds of goodies (butter, sour cream, bacon, chives, celery).  She ordered the smaller portion that came with two stuffed shrimp.  If you get an appetizer this is the size you should get, more than she could eat and she loved every bite.   I ordered the Shrimp Creole.  It came with a side of cheese grits with andouille mixed in.  The creole was not too spicy like a lot of places.  The sauce was full of veggies and chunks of tomato.  It was outstanding and worthy of a repeat order.   My wife had a frozen margarita blended and sipped on it throughout dinner.  I had Cabernet Sauvignon by the glass.  Our server was sweet, spunky, and very attentive.  She was enthusiastic and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and our dinner.  We both probably ate too much but everything was cooked and seasoned so well, it was almost impossible to stop eating.  A truly memorable meal which these days is hard to find.",

I said no, she said ok and walks off, she really didn't want to be there. So we left a great tip.

Everyone agreed the food was excellent except for  the salmon  which was  overcooked and a bit dry . The  price on the food was probably average for the kind of food, the service and the restaurant ambience.  It was cool enough that most people were eating inside, but they do have a nice outside area and they have a nice area where people wait for the reservations. They did take reservations until 4:30 and after that it was first come first serve.",

Manager did she was one of her better waitress- we'll all went down hill from that moment - 20 minutes wait for refills, drinks and that is with constantly asking- I can go on. It a shame because I was entertaining customers and they were quite surprised by the service. One more thing - I ordered desert to go, when I got to my hotel- no utensils!

She loved it and I liked it which is something since I rarely care for Creme Brulee!   The special cocktail which was made with watermelon was also excellent.

Service is usually  really prompt, but if you want optimal service I would eat at the bar.  1. Lobster Sizes. I try to Order 2lbs or So, and every time I have been up-sold to a 3 or 4 pounder without any discount. 2. The Lobster Eat All you Can deal was turning away customers by 7pm on the opening night,, I was showing off and brought 4 guests up from Gilbert, just to get turned away. 3. The Temperature in there is a bit chilly, so if you don't devour your food quickly, it can tend to get a bit cold.

I honestly think it tasted like any other meat since it was battered and fried. Anything tastes good fried, right?  What made it special was the dipping sauce. I liked it. For dinner my husband ordered some type of fish with the dirty rice. I could not stop eating his rice. I would love to know the secret ingredient.  I ordered the shrimp platter and it was heavenly. The shrimp with crab cakes on top was seriously something I will be craving.   The portions are huge. We were so stuffed and yet could not resist taking a peek at the desserts. We ended up taking them home to eat later after we walked off some of the food we ate. We dropped them off and later when we got home to eat them they were still delicious.   We got the bread pudding and banana pudding. I don't usually care for bread pudding but they have converted me with theirs. The next day we ate the banana pudding and again- I am converted. We bought our babysitter the chocolate cake and she seemed to really like it.   Definitely will be returning!",

I had the Parmesan Crusted Flounder it was really quite good.  My wife the pan seared salmon which she enjoyed as well.  The restaurant turns tables fast - we were in/out in less than an hour.  We didn't feel rushed though - just everything was timed perfectly.  Drinks, salad, entree and deserts offered.  Note: The deserts looked phenomenal , but we were so stuffed had to pass.  Next time we will split an entree and save just a little bit of room for desert.",

They had a live band playing in a very nice court yard with water features and seating outside. The cocktails were very good. I started with a dozen oysters, they were excellent. I also had the Filet Mignon and grilled lobster tail. It was beyond words. The service was excellent. A little pricey our tab was over $300  for a party of three. I would go again. It is a very fun environment and very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet romantic place, not so much.",

Thank God I'm not you.   Yeah, the place is expensive. I'm worth it. The calories, oh the calories. I'll be back in January for my birthday. I hope to be thinner by then and can afford the calories.  Three months away, I can do it... Maybe. I shouldn't have ordered the banana pudding in the mason jar.  It is DELICIOUS. And I got the lid and I'm taking most of it home.

    "text": "Yes, it's a chain... but there are some good chains. This is one of those places that has such a gargantuan menu with so much goodness that you want to go back just to try everything that you missed on the first run.  The appetizer offerings had so much I wanted to try, particularly the fried alligator; however, this time we tried the mussels, which were delicious.  I'm pretty picky about mussels, I don't like when they are small and have that graininess when you bite into them.  The mussels at Pappadeaux were fantastic -- large in size, very mild, without any graininess whatsoever.     I ordered the Big Bay Platter for the main course, which comes with Montage Shrimp (jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab), 3 small Caribbean lobster tails, and grilled shrimp.  The price was reasonable for the amount of seafood, about $25.95 and I was really happy with the dish.  The shrimp montage were delicious, stuffed with generous portion of crab meat; the lobster was pretty good, and the grilled shrimp were basted with a spicy sauce that was very tasty.  This was all served on a bed of dirty rice and green beans.  There is so much more I want to come back and try, like the alligator, and some of the other entrees.    A few tips:  - Get there early or call ahead to get your name on the list, this place gets packed.  -  be prepared that it's very loud in here, especially when they have the \"New Orleans trio\" band playing.    - Watch out for the parking lot, it's like a parking lot at the mall on black Friday. You've been warned.  I will definitely return to Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen.",

It is certainly a seafood driven menu, but if you're like me, you will have the option of mozerella sticks for an appetizer, several salads, and chicken tenders or chicken pasta.

The service really pushed Pappadeux above and beyond on my list. Our waitress, Esther, was so sweet and professional and did a great job of taking care of us without hovering.

The stuffed shrimp sound better on the menu than they actually taste. The mashed potatoes tasted as if they came out of a box, which is surprising considering how much they charge for them. The best part of the meal was when my husband kindly let me try a bite of his lobster bisque.... and I don't think I've ever tasted anything so delicious!!  that one bite is the reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of one.

I asked to talk to a manager right before leaving and had to wait a couple of minutes for them to pull her from a meeting (looked like about 8-12 people in a room having a meeting) not sure why at 5:45 (dinner rush they were having a meeting.  The manage apologized and offered to treat us to dinner, I choose not to accept as my time is worth more than a free meal.  I was so upset that because this my buddy from the mid west comes to town often and raves about how good there food is (I was originally from Seattle - looking for good seafood in AZ).    So with that being said - horrible experience (actually the worst experience I have had so far in Phoenix)",

    "text": "IMHO the meals at Pappadeaux look better than they actually taste.  The flavors were either underwhelming or over salted.  But, they have a great staff that aims to please and is very good about providing substitutions for anything on their extensive menu.    What I found amazing were the desserts.  And as picky az I'm iz, it's hard to find amazing restaurant food.  Anyway, this review is strictly for the dessert.  Very yummy!  If I could eat sweets all day, I would order all desserts and feast like a Roman.    The usual suspects:  vanilla cheesecake, praline cheesecake, chocolate cake, bread pudding, creme brule, banana pudding, key lime pie, pecan/sweet potato pie.  Some were topped a la mode, some with yummy creme, berries, thin vanilla wafer, and came with sauces.  (I don't care for sweet sauces with desserts.  That's just overkill.  For goodness sake, aren't we obese enough?)  Who(m)ever is doin' the desserts is mmm oohhh mmm yeah  doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW  doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW   The portions are large so unless you're a glutton like me, you'll need to share.  Move over salmon!  These are the ones that I made room for:  1.  Banana pudding comes in a mason jar that's your keepsake.  Make sure you get a lid, too.  Topped with a tall serving of whipped cream, side strawberry, and a thin vanilla wafer.  I hadn't eaten whipped cream in such a long time, I ate it fast but it took a good five minutes before actually getting to the pudding.  Not a pudding fan, but it looked so pretty, I had to try it.    2.  Slices of cheesecakes looked about 4\" in height and the top is browned so you can tell that they've been baked, deliciously, and then topped with whipped cream and berries.  One came with strawberry sauce, the other with caramel sauce.  The cheese sat on thick graham [Of Course!] crust.  It was hard to stop eating - ur, tasting - these.    3.  Slice of key lime pie was...key lime pie.  Decent sweet / tartness and a good thick crust.  Holds its own, but I'm not an avid eater of key lime.  4.  Slice of pecan/sweet potato pie came a la mode, quite sweet, and came with bourbon sauce.  The top is packed with pecan halves layered over the sweet potato.  Unfortunately the syrup from the pie, over powers the potato layer (which I could not even taste) and seeps into the crust.  I love pecans.  I love sweet potato.  But I gots no love for syrup.  It sort of ruined the pie.  Did I eat it though?  Sho' nough!",

Because it's so busy, the service is terrible too. They're always busy. You have to wait to get a table, even with a reservation, then wait for a long time for them to take your order. The last time my family went, the staff was VERY apologetic so maybe our experience was unique. We counted and they apologized to us 10 different times.  I concede that the waiting may be due in large part to going during popular nights (Friday and Saturday) and that this is a VERY popular restaurant but I didn't find any of it worthwhile.  I love seafood, but I really didn't think the food was very good, honestly.",

Came on a Saturday late night and when I called around 8pm to gauge to wait I was told 45 minutes to 1 hour yikes. We decided to go anyway and take our chances. Just our luck that soon as we put our names down a booth in the bar area opened up so we got super lucky and were able to get seated instantly. My sister and I shared baked crab mac and cheese, gumbo, crawfish bisque and fried shrimp with fries. Don't come here with a small appetite because the menu is so vast that it's so tempting to order more and more just to try everything especially if you are a seafood lover like myself. I thought the prices were reasonable which was another impressive point. The drink menu is also very expansive with lots of cool options so overall this is a great place not just for food, but if you want just a drink since the bar area itself is quite large. For sure recommend!",

We had a big group when we went but it really wasn't a problem for this place because it's such a large restaurant. The menu is extensive and heavy on the seafood which is awesome since it is delicious! We always get the fried alligator appetizer which is SO GOOD! I know it sounds gross but where the heck are you ever going to find ALLIGATOR?! Try it, especially with the sauce... YEAH! We have also tried the oysters on the half shell (great) and the fried oysters with fries (yum!)  For dinner I like to get the pasta mardi gras which is linguine with shrimp and sausage in a creamy marinara sauce. It has a bit of a kick to it which I like but the portion is really big so it's best to share. Crawfish etouffee is great and is a favorite of my dad. We have had the king crab as well which is yummy but can be hard to crack the shells and take apart. The filet mignon oscar was good but a little light on the crab meat that is on top of the steak.   This place can get quite loud so be careful! Also can be a bit pricey but I believe the cost is less if you go for lunch.",

So we had a reservation at 7:30 and got there around 7:10 which was fine we got to sit outside and enjoy the weather which is awesome this time of year.  At 7:35 we were called to our table.  We already saw the menu outside so we were ready to order once seated.    My dad got the stuffed lobster and I got the Chilean sea bass.  After about 20 min the manager came over and apologized for the wait which I wasn't even concerned about yet.  She said they overcooked the sea bass the first time so they had to re-fire it.  They brought our dishes out about 5 min later.  Everything was good as always and then about 7 min later she brings over this huge piece of sea bass and said again she was sorry.    I was amazed as I was not worried about anything and didn't even get upset for the overcooking the first time.  She also said she was going to comp a dessert for me which worked out great cause it was my Dad's bday so she brought a special creme brulee at the end of the meal with a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate which was just perfect.    I love this place and it brings me back to New Orleans every time I go which is a great place to be reminded of.",

Dad hadn't had Oysters on the half shell in many years. The place is very large, dimly lit and was busy busy busy! But I think they have a lot of experience with handling the crowds. I would have preferred a quieter restaurant, but the food quality was worth the inconvenience of barely being able to carry on a conversation without yelling. We had appetizers (alligator was good!) and a good meal  -Costa Rican Tilapia LaFayette. OH man! the food was excellent. I would definitely go again in spite of the noise and crowd...

We started with an hour wait (no problem at all we sat and had drinks) At the bar we had frog legs mmm they were good. Our buzzer went off and we got seated. First they never gave us silverware I had to get up and ask for it (no problem they were busy) Our waiter seemed pre-occupied and made us feel like unwanted guest.  We sat with our drinks empty most of the dinner our appetizers came late and our food came cold. I had Costa Rican Mahi it was very good although cold the grits and sauce were amazing. My husband had bacon wrapped shrimp he asked for a baked potato side was quoted a $3.95 price (I may be wrong on the change) and when the bill came it was almost $6.00 for a baked potato that also came way after the food came out. We went with friends they had the seafood platter and chicken linguini. Meal is over we are thirsty as our glasses weren't refilled. Our friends food gets taken to the back to be boxed only one meal got boxed and when we asked about the other he went to the back and came back with a piece of fish in a box. When we asked where the rest of the meal went he said it got dumped. Well wait that makes no sense as I have a piece of fish right here how do you dump fries but save the fish that was on top of the fries? Needless to say they won't be eating the fish!  He did give 2 free deserts to make up for the food that got thrown. Key lime pie was very good as was the chocolate brownie.  Of course we will return we enjoy this place. Hopefully next time it will be better :)",

I remember spending a night at their bar watching Kim blow the D-Back's lead in the World Series while eating some fried alligator.    Since then I have learned to appreciate food more and have become quite fond of Pappadeaux, especially during happy hour.  Pappadeaux's has never let me down in regards to food.  When you sit at the bar the service is sometimes, more often then not, lacking (hence the reason for only four stars).    You can't go wrong with the Oysters, and their Po' Boys are on point.  If you are there for dinner anything you order is sure to please, but maybe try the seafood platter.  Pretty sure we have sampled most of the menu, which does change.  If you have never had Alligator, try it!!  I can go on and on, but again I don't remember a menu item I did not like or would not recommend.  Me not being a dessert fan it is hard, but I would recommend the key lime pie.  Pappadeaux's you are a treat, thank you for the fresh product and refreshing drink.",

If you are from Louisiana, or travel there often, this place doesn't compare to the real deal.  Our party had the half-price oyster deal and ordered several orders.  They liked them, but I thought they were just OK.  It was a good value though.  I had ordered the new scallops and sweet pea risotto, and it was pretty tasty, but the portion size was way too small and way overpriced.  I only had 5 scallops on my plate and they were relatively small.  I felt like I could have gotten more scallops for less from the grocery store.  We got the bananas foster cheesecake for desert, which was pretty uninspiring to me.  Seemed like a regular cheesecake with very little topping whatsoever.  If it's not a traditional bananas foster desert, don't bother with it.  Also, there aren't very many non-seafood options on the menu!",

    "text": "With all the great reviews and seeing as how crowded it was, I was really sad that my experience wasn't the same.  It's been a long time since I've been to the ones in TX but I certainly don't remember the experience being that bad so maybe it was the timing and the location.  On to my review...  We ordered the fried alligator, Mississippi Catfish Opelousas, and what I think was the Crawfish Etouffee.  The only saving grace was the fried alligator which was very well done.  I always used to get it at a cajun place back home so I was excited to try it here.  This is the one thing that Pappadeaux cooked right.  It was perfectly fried without it being too greasy and the alligator was tender.  The Mississippi Catfish Opelousas on the other hand was awful!  Maybe it was an off day but it wasn't nearly as good as it sounded.  The catfish fillet itself was the worse part.  You know how they usually make catfish nuggets with the stomach of the fish? The not-so-good part of the fish.  Well this fillet tasted worse than that.  The whole fillet was such bad quality that we didn't finish it.  I hate wasting food but I didn't even bother taking it home. It was a really big piece too.  It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth clearly.   The etouffee was meh.  Not as horrible as the catfish dish but I've certainly had better.  And this is not even including the ones I had in TX and New Orleans.  Didn't bother taking that home either.  And I love leftovers since that means I don't have to cook!  Sigh - overall, I was sorely disappointed especially more so b/c of all the great reviews and how crowded it was.  I'll have to go back again when I am in TX visiting family and see how it compares.  The one nice thing was the live entertainment on the patio area while we waited outside for our table.  The band was good.",

    "text": "Ate here tonight! This is a really nice, spacious restaurant with an outdoor area that had live music tonight. We ate indoors though, and the decor and general ambiance was really nice. Not so uptight as to make you feel uncomfortable to eat with your family, but certainly befitting the price range and quality.  I have a few minor quibbles that would make this more of a 4.5 star review, but I thought I'd round up since they're so insignificant.  To begin with, the food and beverages were good! I had the Strawberry Tea and my mom had the Mango Lemonade, and they were both flavorful without tasting artificial. No review on the alcoholic drinks, unfortunately. The meals were VERY generously sized (Seriously, we all took home enough to have a second and possibly third meal tomorrow) and good... for the most part. The fried crabfinger dinner was a bit salty and the lobster bisque might not be for everyone. The clam chowder and pasta mardi gras were amazing though. Also, beware the dirty rice--the taste really lives up to the name, and you may not be prepared for it. My mom, thinking it was just a clever name for a rice pilaf, certainly wasn't.  Service was great! Our waiter was very ninja-like, suddenly reappearing with refills. He was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. Our only issue was that at one point, as we were at the end of our meal, he seemed to disappear completely. We wanted to get our plates boxed and our check paid, and that took much longer than we expected. Still, it wasn't exactly a hassle waiting for him to show up and I'm sure we could have been more proactive about getting the bill if we had really been in a rush.  In short, a great place to dine if you don't mind spending a bit of money. Considering this is seafood and they give you huge plates, I think the cost is definitely worth it, but don't be surprised to see those $20-$30+ entrees.",

The place was packed on a Saturday night at 5pm, which is a good indication one is in for a treat.  We made a reservation just in case, since we were going to see a show later that night.  Our waiter greeted us quickly and was very friendly and upbeat.  He told us the specials and took our drink order while we looked over the huge menu.  In the end we got the lobster roll appetizer, halibut, and bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was soooo... good and very filling.  The lobster appetizer was full of flavor, especially the sauce it came with.  The halibut was cooked perfectly and the grits on the side were amazing.  We loved the bread pudding, which was HUGE for the price.  I wish there weren't as many raisins, but all in all it was great.  So glad to have found this place!  I know it's a chain, which I usually don't love, but the old-school vibe and good quality/quantity of food made up for that.  We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "My in-laws wanted to take me somewhere for my birthday, and Pappa's always used to be one of my favorites so for dinner, this is where we decided to go. Even though many chain restaurants have come and gone in the era, this restaurant has remained a staple along the I-17 freeway. It's always tricky to get to especially when heading south on the I-17 since you have to go one exit past the restaurant, make a U-turn, and drive on the access road, but it's always crowded no matter what, even on a Thursday evening.   The oysters were really good. They were fresh and regular in size.   The Grand Hennessy drink was an especially tasty treat! Almost dessert like from the start! It featured the Hennessy VS Marnier with fresh lemon and orange juices with a \"splash of Moscato D'Asti.\" It's also very refreshing too - something I'd really enjoy during the summer.  I usually order more traditional fare like catfish with dirty rice or similar, but this time I ordered the biggest photo right smack on in the middle of their menu, The Lobster Boil. It somewhat reminded me of what you'd find at Joe's Crab Shack, but definitely much higher quality and less salty. I felt like everything was deliciously bathed in butter and light spices.   The service was less than to be desired. It seemed like the restaurant was understaffed that night. From the get go, they sat our group of four instead of the couple that arrived there before us, so they brought only two menus, so as the hostess sat us, she only gave us two menus and took away the other 2 place settings. No problemo. I simply asked for her to keep those extra settings there and bring us two more menus. But then, our waiter would disappear for long periods of time, and forgot to bring my father in law a 2nd drink as requested, so the less than stellar performance kind of left us disappointed even though the food was good. It's not a deal breaker or anything, but that cheerful memory of this place is definitely jaded a bit now.",

I tried the surf and turf pasta, it was tasty. It was only on the lunch menu which I didn't realize, priced at $19, but I was charged  $28. The gave a really good amount of shrimp, I could have done without the sausage. Wasn't a fan. My boyfriend ordered chicken strips and fries (he doesn't like seafood). The portion was laughable, it looked like he ordered from a kids menu. Small portion, which could have been ok if they atleast plated it nicely. It's all just tossed on a small plate. I am definitely interested in going again and trying something else, I was playing it a little safe.",

Not to mention the great service by a young lady named yelena who well deserved the tip that she received, she made the experience even better. It was seven of us and she made sure drinks were full and food was out in a timely manner .Three of us had the shrimp etoufee and all i can say is Mercy. The crab mac and cheese yummy goodness . Also the fried calamari and seafood platter . I can keep going on and on because we ordered so much food we were stuffed before our entrees even came out. Everything was so good no complaints at all. On my way to catch my flight to San francisco lets just say this spot is now one of my favorite spots to visit in Arizona.....See you next time",

On a recent coerced visit there were 40 - 50 people waiting outside to be seated in an empty restaurant.  We were told the servers weren't scheduled to start for another half-hour.  How absurd!  The responsible manager should have been terminated immediately.  Prices are extremely high for the quality and quantity of food served.  Simply put, this is a chain restaurant that is trying to be upscale; and failing miserably. Service is slow, the wait staff have way too many tables; the bartenders are Chili/Applebee quality but with upscale bar pricing.  The recent salmonella episode at the restaurant adds to my \"never again\" attitude.  Eat at your own risk.",

Hot boiled shrimp with potatoes is the best deal on happy hour.  The portion is big enough to make a meal in itself.  Too bad they don't serve this on the regular menu.  The catfish beignet is also good.    The quality of fried calamari is better than most places.  Fried alligator is decent.  And spend a little more for the blue point oysters.  They're huge and tasty.  I've had the mahi mahi alexander, grilled shrimp and andouille sausage.  The latter isn't all healthy but delicious.   Don't get the fish fry or filet steak.  I'm picky about fish fry.  In my lifetime, I've only found 2 places that makes really good fish fry.  One in northwest Phoenix and the other in North Carolina lol.  Granted fish fry isn't all that healthy, but I want to be able to see the fish, not taste all the batter and grease.  The filet was overpriced and more fatty like a ribeye. Go to a steakhouse instead.   Oh, lets not forget about dessert.  Creme brulee is usually my favorite dessert, it's light.  They now have the Andes mint cheesecake.  The best of both worlds.  Yum!!!",

Then the main course, my wife had the Brazino on the Half Shell and I had the Costa Rican Mahi and Lemon Chile Crab.  We finished then evening with coffee and the Bread Pudding and Bourbon sauce.  To say the food was excellent is an understatement. Now for an equally if not more important part of the evening, our server. Victoria, AKA: Tory did an exceptional job.

This time, we ordered the appetizer trio, shrimp gumbo, the fried shrimp & cajun chicken tenderloins platter, & the 2 catfish plate. We thought that the best thing on the trio platter was the shrimp & crawfish fondeaux! It was really creamy & tasted delicious with the crostini. The two other items on the plate were also worth mentioning; the hot salmon was really flavorful due to the honey mustard that it was topped with & the alligator sauce was really tasty (I've never had alligator & it wasn't for me but it was really crispy). The shrimp gumbo was interesting ... again, not for me but not bad either. Our dinner items we had ordered were good - the shrimp & chicken were both crispy & tasty, the catfish not as much but still okay.  I think that this restaurant, based on the service & food gets 3.5 stars (4 only b/c I really enjoyed the fondeaux!!). This would have been much more impressive of a restaurant if the prices were lower, but I'd leave it as an option for a once-in-a-blue-moon date night option.",

I cannot even remember the last time I was here - probably it was 5 or 6 years ago - since I live in the East Valley. I was running errand and decided to visit the restaurant again.  A long long time ago, I was amazed by the flavorful and scrumptious crawfish varieties. However, since crawfish is not on season anymore, I ought to try other items on the menu. I was hesitate at first, but pictures and appealing descriptions of the food got me. So I decided to try Mixed Gulf Coast Oysters & Shrimp for appetizers, along with Seafood Cobb Salad,  Chilean Sea Bass, Crab Fingers Combo, Atlantic Swordfish, Scallop & Shrimp.   The seafood were so fresh, and the Crab Finger Combo was creamy and tasty. Especially, the Seabass was fantastic. To me it tasted as close as the taste of lobster - Well... I may be a bit of exaggerating, but it was moist, chewy, and cooked perfectly at the same time.   Our server was quick and attentive, needless to say the fries came out within a heart beat. I'd recommend this place!",

So we left the fish and squash, over half a meal uneaten. Talked to the waitress about the taste of fish. She offered another piece to go. We declined. I'm sorry why would we want another piece of the fish that we didn't like already. Never once did a manager come around and check to see how things were even though there were 2 of them walking around. We felt as a customer and with a bill of over $100 for 2 people they could have offered something to make us feel like a valued customer and want to bring us back and give them another try. The 2 Managers walked right behind us as we were leaving and never even acknowledged us or even said thank you! This would have been a great training opportunity for the new server who was being trained. Overall disappointing experience, sad to say.",

    "text": "So I'll confess... I'm from NOLA & my expectations are always high at Pappadeaux, but this location def missed the marked.   I've been to most of the ATL locations as as Houston and it's always been \"good for a chain.\" But dropping into the Phoenix location for HH left much, if not everything, to be desired.  Drinks: Chain seafood is one thing, but you can traditionally always expect good drinks at Pappadeaux. The bartenders at this place, however, were dismal at best. Ordered the Baton Sweet Tea and the Swamp Thing, and they were so weak that it felt like I had ordered them virgin.   Food: The Mini Fondeaux is typically a great appetizer and a highlight on their HH menu. In Phoenix, it was a barely palatable mix of cheese and mushrooms. If there was any seafood in it, they must have swam away before it was served. We didn't bother getting our usual entrees, the cheesy mushroom soup that out fondeaux resembled was just enough to hold us over until we could make it to a better restaurant.  Service: Mediocre, but met the bare necessities.  Ambience: More monotone and quiet than usual. TNF was on, but with the awkward TV placement, I'm sure no noticed or cared.   If you're starving or have low expectations, give it a try if you must. I'd steer clear otherwise.",

    "text": "We were in the mood for seafood on a Monday night and thought Pappadeaux would be the perfect place. To my surprise, this place was packed and I know why.  Our waiter Benjamin was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We were in the mood for some calamari but decided to go with an untraditional version of fried calamari. Benjamin recommended the Mediterranean calamari which comes with a lemon caper sauce, feta cheese and artichokes. It was amazing! The fried calamari was served hot and crispy despite being served in an abundant portion of sauce which was so flavorful!  We ordered a Caesar salad and to my surprise, it had the perfect amount of dressing and cheese! I say this because I find myself always having to order extra sauce or dressing on my entrees because most restaurants skimp.   We were also served a hot baguette fresh from the oven and our server recommended that we dip the bread in the lemon caper sauce from the calamari and it was addicting!   We ordered the lobster tail which came with mashed potatoes and broccolini and the shrimp and scallop orecchiette pasta with asparagus and lump crab in a creamy vodka sauce.  The 12 oz lobster tail was cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned, grilled yet very tender. Each bite tastes like little pockets from heaven especially when you dip it in the melted butter. 12ounces is actually a very generous portion. The broccolini and the mashed potatoes were the perfect sides for this succulent and flavorful lobster tail. We had just come back from Newport Coast and this lobster tail dish ranks as one of the best prepared shellfish entrees that we have ever had.   My pasta dish had plenty of \"tomatoey, creamy\" vodka sauce. It wasn't bitter or spicy. It was flavorful with the right amount of cream in order to cut out the acidity and bitterness of the tomato sauce. My pasta was cooked al dente and it came with 4 jumbo sized shrimp. One of my pet peeves is when shrimp isn't properly deveined or cleaned. That was Not the case here but let me tell you about my scallops! My scallops were sweet, tender, savory and they melt in your mouth. On top of my pasta dish were portions of lump crab meat that only because of its color, could easily be missed but the naked eye but not by your taste buds. No doubt that the crab meat added to the decadence of this dish which also had a few pieces of perfectly cooked asparagus tossed in. I truly was doubtful about the combination of scallops, crab and shrimp in this entree has to be one of the best seafood pasta dishes in town!!!!   For dessert, yes we still ordered dessert! How can you pass up dessert when they bring out the fresh dessert tray for you to view?!!!! We ordered the banana pudding. I know what you're thinking. Of the entire selection: key lime pie, creme brulee, cheesecake, praline cheesecake, and Haagen Daz ice cream (I can't even remember the others), I picked the vanilla wafer banana pudding?!!!! Yes I did! The chilled banana pudding is served in a mason jar, is densely layered with wafers, whipped cream ( actual heavy cream that is whipped and sweetened with sugar! No cool whip here!), and fresh banana slices. When I say fresh banana slices, I mean that there was not one brownish, mushy banana slice in the jar! This dessert doesn't look like much but the portion is very generous and we could NOT finish it.  We decided to take the dessert home and they bring you the lid to the mason jar so you can take it home.  Overall the value was excellent! We took our entrees and our dessert home.  Now let's talk about the service!!! Benjamin our waiter was attentive and never needed cuing from us for him to refill our beverages. We always had plenty of everything! New forks for the salad and main dishes, plenty of napkins, bussed the table immediately. I really appreciate when the staff is able to make recommendations because they are knowledgeable about the menu. He was excellent, polite, attentive yet allowed us our privacy. I have had experiences at restaurants where waiters tell us their entire life story. Uhhh awkward! Pappadeaux knows what they are doing and it shows!  I swear to you that I am not receiving any compensation or benefit from this review. We overheard someone say as they were leaving the restaurant,\"This place makes me feel good!\"  Enough said!",

We went to check and she told us it would be about 2 hours, and that other reservations had \"come in\" and were put ahead. So after waiting for 30 minutes, we finally were told we were behind EVERYONE ELSE when hardly anyone else was even there waiting!! Which was bad enough but we would have waited.

But for about a year now, the food has gone down hill a little bit.  the past 2 times we've been here the roux has been burnt!!!  Is anyone else picking up on this??  My Grandma who was born and raised in Louisiana and has cooked creole food for years says she thinks they've switched to pre-made roux from a jar.  Either that, or the chef doesn't know what he's doing.  When we went several months ago, she ordered a big bowl of the seafood gumbo, I ordered a small cup.  Immediately she said it tasted burnt and sent it back.  I sent back my cup as well and had the lobster bisque, which is always excellent.  We thought it was just a fluke or an off night, so when we went a couple weeks ago, she steered clear from anything with roux, but my lunch order came with a cup of seafood gumbo...Once again, it tasted burnt to me...so that was the last straw. Something is off with their roux and thats twice now, spread months apart..Maybe they HAVE switched to store bought roux...who knows. I wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber to do that, but something is definitely off with their roux.  If and when we go back, I'll steer clear of it and just order something else.",

I had a chance to watch them for a long time, as I was \"vulturing\" on one of the outdoor balcony tables: there are three, and they are offered on a first-come-first-served basis. The patio seating was devoted to private functions on the two nights we dined here, and we really wanted outdoor tables, because I have a shellfish allergy and wanted to be in the open air. The reason I mention a food allergy is because of the highly professional and dedicated approach the staff uses to ensure an excellent and safe guest experience. After telling my server, the manager actually came to the table and the manager has to basically be in the loop on the order, which is amazing. The food was great and our experience was delightful. Hats off to this place!",

Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!  Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were back at Pappadeaux last Monday. Right off the bat I will say that I have never gone to Pappadeaux and not had at least a 15 minute wait. There have been times that I was quoted a 1.5 hour wait. Waiting sucks but the food is worth it. Personally a 45 minute wait is my cut off but if there is a seat at the bar I will get a few drinks while waiting.   We were seated and the waitress explained that she was training so we expected to possibly experience a couple hiccups. We ordered a dozen oysters, fried gator and shared a blackened salmon and salad. Our oysters and gator came out immediately with bread and butter. Everything was excellent. Then we waited for our entree and salad....and waited...and waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes our waitress came by and apologized and let us know that our entree was coming. I tried to play it cool and not act agitated but at this point we knew we would miss the movie that we had planned on seeing after eating. I requested that she bring out our salad while we wait for our entree.   Our waitress arrived 5 minutes later with our entree and salad in hand and once again apologized for the wait. She also explained that our there was an issue with our salmon when the chef split our meal onto two plates and that she would be bringing us out another fillet shortly. BTW, it is nice that it was split for 2 but I would have been equally happy to share from the same plate, however I do see this as an over and above service and appreciate these little efforts. She also offered to bring us a dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the wait and the problem with the salmon. The food was all delicious and as promised the waitress brought out the dessert tray and asked what we would like to try. We went for the creme brulee which did not disappoint. Our check did not include the dessert and we were given half off our oysters. This is why I adore Pappadeaux. If there is a problem they go way beyond to fix it and make it up to you.",

This is one of the few places I've tfound to be very consistant,  excellent service, great decor, and some of the best food you'll find for Cajun restaurant, that has a multi-state presence!  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is its always busy plan, so ahead! Secondly it is pretty pricey $$$$! So definitely bring your favorite credit card,  you'll need it! Overall this is one of the best locations, and the Servers, the Management team,  just really great folks. I think you'll find nothing but a wonderful experience for you, Family, and Friends.",

    "text": "I have been here 2-3 times in the past and remember liking it a lot more.  Today, however, I went during the lunch and thought the food was very uninspired.  I really hate to say this, but I think Pappadeaux is becoming Red Lobster with a Cajun twist.  This place has somehow transformed itself from a unique eatery into a full blown Red Lobster meets Joe's Crab Shack franchise.  The only difference is the price (higher) and the seasoning (Cajun) instead of over-salting.  The seafood is no doubt frozen as well.  Sure, I love fried fish and other creole calorie bombs just as much as everyone else, but I think this place is losing its authenticity as it makes its play towards the masses.  Anyway, I wouldn't mind coming back to try more of their offering to prove my theory, but I'm certainly not going to rush.",

    "text": "came out on Tuesday night after hearing all those positive reviews. I had high hopes for this place especially since the entrees were mostly $18-45 each. I ordered a crayfish platter, a sausage and seafood gumbo, and then a shrimp brochette. My friend ordered a pan seared tilapia. My friend's tilapia had jumbo shrimp and crab meat on top. The tilapia tasted moist but under-seasoned along with the shrimp. The shrimp was crisp but that was the only good thing about it. As for my gumbo, the muddy taste of the oyster ruined it for me. The crayfish platter was NASTY!! The fried crayfish half was ok but nothing special. The crayfish creole part tasted DISGUSTING along with the dirty rice. I tried one bite and then told the waitress to take it away for me. My waitress recommended another entree for me which was the shrimp brochette. It was another huge disappointment. The bacon and cheese wrapped around the jumbo shrimp was so overpowering and fattening that I couldn't take another bite. The manager came over to apologize and took the two items I ordered off our tab but I don't think I will come back again....charging such high prices for bad quality food #smh",

The food is usually A+ I wish they would try to incorporate more or any organic food options in their menu because that would allow a lot more people to enjoy the food a lot more often!!  And, it would explain the super high prices :/ WHEW!  $25.00 for 6 medium-large sized shrimp they call Jumbo wrapped in bacon, stuffed with some cheese and jalapeno yea it has the cheese and jalepeno inside...gets my mouth watering at the thought of how delicious it is but is too expensive to enjoy but maybe once a year or on a very special occasion.  Good food but everything is fried and sometimes the dirty rice has weird chunks in it...not sure if it is grizzle from sausage or something else from the meat(s) in the dirty rice..",

Wonderfully seasoned with perfect heat. Amazing food.  Also had the excellent praline pecan cheesecake that surpasses all cheesecakes I gave ever eaten.

They have a good variety of seafood to pick from the menu, which is something you don't see all the time in Arizona.  Service was good, but began to feel a little rushed as we lingered over desert.  We split a Caesar Salad which was very fresh but a bit overdressed and it came with a small loaf of warm French bread..  The 2 different salmon dishes we ordered were really good, well seasoned and cooked to exactly as ordered (didn't need the side sauce.)  By the way the house margarita is pretty good as well. One came out with broccoli rob instead of the green beans on the menu, but  the waiter quickly took it back and returned with the beans and gave us a couple glasses of wine for the mistake.  We finished with coffee and a Pecan Cheesecake which was very good. When we left there were a bunch of people inline waiting for a table and the place was packed. All and all we considered the experience to be positive and will return again. I have heard wait time during peak time can be greater than a hour, so I would suggest to go in off hours or plan a large wait time.",

Great service, great food this place is my new regular seafood restaurant spot forever! We had the best gulf Coast Oysters, the crispest alligator and amazing jumbo crab cakes! So glad my parents referred us to this place. And don't even get me started on the Creme Brule ! I work in the restaurant industry and it's rare to have my standards met and damn did this place do an amazing job. Yah.. boo hoo we had to wait 10 mins with a reservation but it was so worth it even the bread was amazing!",

The halibut was a bit over cooked but tasty, shrimp was yummy too. The octopus was very chewy & I wasn't fond of the taste. My daughter had the filet mignon Oscar & love it. It was just the 2 of us & we did have an appetizer & each had 1 cocktail. The check was $142 which is on the steep side.",

The overall service at the bar area was laid back and on point for a Friday afternoon. The seafood gumbo w/ andouille sausage was sooo good, as well as the fried cat fish, seasoned, fresh and delicious! My husband totally enjoyed the red beans and rice. We will definitely come back again when visiting Phoenix ...we're still disappointed we don't have a Pappadeaux's n Cali!",

    "text": "What a night! So I decided to treat myself to some lovely mudbugs aka crawfish during the annual crawfish boil that happens every March to April here at Pappadeaux's. I got in just in time to get a seat at the bar and get situated. The fantabulous Susan, Sarah and Colin took GREAT care of me all night. From Susan nudging me to get the bigger glass of beer (good call and it was an easy nudge) to all three of them checking in on me as I was devouring the 2.5 lbs of crawfish I had ordered. #teamgreedy in full effect!  So between the fabulous bar staff and me meeting some new bar patrons, it was a great night. I chatted it up with about everyone and we even had some skinamax stuff going on at the end of the bar. Funny indeed. Oh and to top off my night, my entire dinner tab was paid for by the nice gentleman I had chatted it up with most of the evening. How very sweet and overly generous was that? ( No,no love connection or anything just a kind gesture with NO expectations!) Wow, talking about being blessed.   I only have about two more weeks before the crawfish boil ends. So needless to say I will be back again the next two Thursdays to get my fix.",

Cierra our server was incredibly knowledgable, attentive, friendly and could not have been any better. (Thank you) drinks never with empty food was quick and fresh and absolutely delicious as usual.

HIGHLY recommended:   * Cedar plank salmon with asparagus. * Banana bread pudding in a mason jar! You can get this to go too! INCREDIBLE!! * The pasta that comes with the NOT recommended alaskan king crab legs was yummy. Just get the pasta ala carte.  NOT recommended: * (2) Alaskan king crab legs with pasta. Very pricey and my friend and I were greeted and relayed that their seafood is fresh and flown in. I ordered this item and it was definitely NOT fresh. The crab legs were extremely salty, inedible. The texture was super off.  * Creme brulee - was extremely bland, without flavor and the consistency was very loose, soup -like. Interesting enough I inquired about this to the hostess and she says that's how they make it. I just left it alone. * Mojito (1)  I'll definitely return for other items to try. Yet, I recommend asking what is fresh before you order it. My oder was very disappointing and ironically enough the \"NOT recommended\" portion was mine. Boo.  Good news my friend shared and treated.",

    "text": "The Wife and I visited this Pappadeaux  this evening...and i must say i thought the one in Illinois was great, but this one was even greater. It is the only location in the entire state of Arizona...and it is very spacious with plenty of outdoor seating with cool zone fans. They were having a special on Crawfish which my wife had and i had to show her how to eat them...but she really enjoyed them. I had my usual blackened Halibut with the yvette sauce, and dirty rice and it was simply delicious as usual with other locations i have been to.  The happy hour there is top notch as well, we will probably try that next time...but this place while always packed is so very relaxing and the service is spectacular. If it is not on the menu and you want something in particular they probably will have it there, and they will be more than happy to prepare it for you. It is a little expensive to eat here because it is quality seafood...made to order...but it is well worth it. So the next time you want some great cajun and seafood delights make a trip to this establishment off the I-17 South here in phoenix and you will leave happy. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my friends!!!!",

    "text": "I don't eat seafood nearly enough, primarily because it is typically so expensive, and the pricing here was no exception.  I showed up for dinner at 9:30 on a Tuesday night, so they were not very busy. The restaurant itself was rather large and very nicely decorated. They had a beautiful patio area and I asked if I could be seated out there, but was told it was not available at this time. (I don't know if this was due to it being 9:30 at night or what, but it was an amazing 75 degrees out and would have been perfect. Of course, for most acclimated Arizonans, that is rather chilly.)  I wish I had requested a table as the main area of the restaurant seemed really relaxed and intimate. I ended up being seated at a booth in the bar, directly next to the very loud kitchen.   The waitress was reasonably friendly and promptly re-filled my water cup at least six times. I ordered the Alaskan Halibut & Jumbo Crab.  Within minutes she brought out a loaf of hot, freshly baked bread. It was delicious. My meal came out not long after that. My first impression was, holy crap, that is a TINY meal for $40!  The food was amazing, however. Lot's of flavor and cooked just right. Although I tried to pace myself, it was over all too soon. Immediately upon finishing, I was thinking I could have easily eaten three more just like it. A little bit later, after the meal had settled however, I felt very satisfied, if not quite full.   My total bill, including the tip, came to just less than $50. As I stated above, that is a lot of money for me, and it will definitely limit how often I eat at this place.  I am sure I will try it again sometime however.",

We started by ordering the Crispy Fried Alligator, Crab Fingers (sauteed), Frog Legs, and Calamari.  The Alligator was the best thing we ate the entire meal.  The Crab Fingers were mediocre and very messy.  The Frog Legs were average, and the Calamari was sparse among a pile of deep-fried artichoke (not mentioned in the menu)  Next up was the Andouille Sausage and Seafood Gumbo, which I thought was great; enough for me to finish my cup.  We ordered meals (I got the Crawfish Etoufee).  1 person in our group got her food 20 minutes ahead of everyone else.  The rest of the group received their food by the time she finished her meal.  The guy who had my plate kept pronouncing my dish \"Ee-too-fee crawfish\" so it took a while for us to figure out what he was saying...  Halfway through our meal, another person brings an extra random dish (the same dish that the first person received).  Not a single person felt the need to finish their main course; it just didn't impress us.  The pictures on the yelp site and on their menus may have led us on a bit too much.  Thank goodness my phone can make anything look good...",

Their entree's aren't that great in our opinion and especially for the high price. But their Happy Hour and almost all their appetizers and drinks are worthy of 4-5 stars!! My -1 star is for their regular entree's. We love love love their sauteed crab finger (you won't have this amazingness anywhere else, but they only have them when crab is in season,) Alligator (usually melt in your mouth,) and perfect oyster's! They also have Grey Goose Martinis for 8 dollars (happy hour.) The oyster's have this delicious ceviche sauce, it's a must try!! The building is mostly red brick, surrounded with water fountains and greenery!! It's very gorgeous. If I could imagine a restaurant in Louisiana, I would imagine it to look and feel like this. We will be back for Happy Hour as we have been doing for about 2 years now. But most likely that's it. Wish we enjoyed the entree's but the Happy Hour is plenty worth it!!",

    "text": "Disappointing experience! Every restaurant has a bad day and this was it for sure. We had a party of 15- a yearly drive from CA for my Moms bday. For over 8 years we have had flawless service, food and management. *see my previous review! None of those were on point this weekend. We had a reservation made a month ahead, we called an hour before to confirm, and checked in when arriving. 45 min after reservation time we were seated. Management was lacking and seemed not to want to take accountability for their mistake. The table it self was several tables with a large space between so we could not even be one party. Food for the first time was really a disappointment. Burnt roux gumbo and crawfish dishes left uneaten. No birthday wishes, etc. Typically on this birthday weekend we dine there twice this time only once. Our family left questioning what happened to the Pappadeauxs we always loved.",

    "text": "I admit that growing up in a coastal Atlantic town where we caught our own crabs and fish, it's a very high bar to scale.  I have eaten here twice. The first time I had as a appetizer the Oysters Pappadeaux, a variant of Oysters Rockefeller.  I had to send them back- they were way way way too salty.  For an entree I had a fish and pasta dish, it was okay, but not spectacular.  Today I was someone else's guest, but I got to pick the restaurant. June is the time of year when blue claw crabs molt, and when soft shell crabs are available fresh.  Since I saute them when I cook them when back east, I ordered the pan grilled and not the deep fried softshell dinner plate with three crabs.  Traditionally the lungs are removed,  the eyes and \"face\" of the crab removed, and the rest left intact.  There are also strict rules regarding harvesting of crabs, that their top shell must be a minimal length from point to point.  These softshells had the tops completely removed. The actual bodies of the crabs were grossly undersized, and I mean grossly. One of my three crabs had a body that was only an inch wide.   I don't know if Pappadeaux has crab farms where they raise them, and then segregate them at molting time, or if they are wild harvested.  If they are wild harvested then the crabs served to me were hardly legal, unless they were not from the Atlantic coast.  On top of that, a crab has saline liquid inside of it, so there is no need to put a salt laden coating on the crab before grilling, but Pappadeaux seems to salt them. Eating the crabs was like eating mouthfuls of salt. Had I been the one paying for the meal as I was the first time I ate there, I would have sent them back.  In the future I have decided it is better to wait until I am visiting a coastal area to eat seafood that is brought to market from boats moored at local docks.  The flown in seafood at Pappadeaux has failed to impress me.  The waitstaff was professional, prompt and  friendly. Pity the food does not live up to the servers.",

    "text": "I treated a young friend to her 1st real New Orleans oysters. We began with orders of oysters on the half-shell and Pappadeaux's version of Oysters Bienville (baked cheese topping). I lived in New Orleans for years, so I was disappointed at the soup-y cheese that couldn't stick with the oyster -- took the adventure out of it completely. My favorite, Oysters Rockefeller, was substituted by their version adding hollandaise sauce to the spinach (yuck!) so we passed.  The entrees went better. I had the Shrimp with Andouille Sausage & Red Beans (excellent red beans!) and she got the Shrimp Po Boy & Gumbo combination. We topped off with Praline Bread Pudding in Bourbon Sauce. Highly recommended.  Service was mediocre. Our server was no help even tho I mentioned it was her 1st oyster outing. I tried to the point of frustration to order the appetizers, and she only regurgitated the menu to me repeatedly. I knew how to read. I didn't know how to order combo raw oysters & oysters bienville in a way she could understand, even tho I've done so hundreds of times at Felix's or Antoine's or nearly any New Orleans restaurant. After waiting 20min for our check, we stood to leave and she brought check to us at the hostess stand, so being cumbersome, I signed for a $75+ bill writing a large 15% pointing to tip line and left. Not a big thing, but my checking account was deducted for a $15 tip instead, which I would have not blinked except the service was not worthy of over 15%. For the $3.25 hustle at the register, they got the motivation to write this review. Sad, as I had looked forward to *my kind of restaurant from my old neighborhood.*  The manager did present himself at our table to clear up an allergy question, and he was outstanding. I told my friend, \"Now he's like the waiters usually are in a good restaurant!\" Friendly, interested, concerned, competent, professional. Not so with the overly-tipped waitress.",

This is the place we migrate to when we are looking for a that type of feel good food.  Both outside and inside is fixed up so that you feel like you are in New Orleans or nearby. Service is exceptionable. Just let them know what you need and / or want and they will make it happen. Grandpa Mark says so. Trust me!  Food is always very good and tasty. We like to start off with a  large portion of fried alligator with an extra side of their special Creole dipping sauce. The complimentary French Bead with butter definitely take it to the next level. Dip Me Baby!  Some of our favorites are anything deep fried of coarse, the blackened fish, all the items they grill, as well as the gumbos, salads, all the etouffees dishes and the dirty rice. Tally ho! The menu is just too big to go over it all.  Yummo!  Last visit with the extended family we ordered the Ginger Salmon, Blackened Mahi, Blackened Catfish. Sampler Seafood Platter, Shrimp and Catfish, and of course some Alligator to get things rolling.  Mention a special occasion like a B-Day celebration for an extra special treat. Hmmm?   This is not a Long John's Pete's type fish place so prepare to enjoy. Place gets really busy and loud at peak times. Recommend going there for an early lunch to get the extra attention.   Mr. Mark ........ table ready.  Ah-YEE!",

Everyone is very friendly and prompt service.  We got the appetizer trio to include fried alligator, fried frog legs, and mozzarella. Everything was great. The alligator is a must have and the breading is so light and delicious. The mozzarella sticks were huge and tasty too. We also split the mussels in a sausage, lemon, garlic, wine sauce. Plenty of food and delicious. Mussels are huge! Save some bread to dip in the sauce. So good (:  Of course we ended with the creme brulee which was perfect to share and very good.

While looking at the menu you notice that it is soooo expensive! Literally everything. which is a bummer because you could go to BBW nearby or Olive Garden or Red Lobster for less. We still decided to give it a try again. I had the pasta mardi gras. my son had the chicken tenders usual for kids lol and my hubby and daughter shared the medium sized fried shrimp plate with baked potatoes. It was really busy when we went and i had to keep asking our server to fill up our drinks multiple times and I felt like i was bothering. Our server was a good sport though. We got the lobster spinach dip which was really good. Our food finally came. My plate was huge! Lots of noodles and crawfish and shrimp! The sauce coulda been a little thicker to my liking. It seemed a little watery, but still good. My son enjoyed his food. My daughter and hubbys plate seemed like a small portion. The shrimps were like little tiny shrimps. They enjoyed them, but i feel like chaarging 30.00 for some small shrimps was a rip off. The baked potatoes were huge!! We couldnt even finish them. Overall it was a good experience. It was expensive and the food wasnt like amazing. Probably wont be coming back anytime. But worth a try if you like seafood.",

    "text": "This amazing place almost got 5 Stars. It is honestly a terrific place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. My Brother-In-Law was up from Tucson and had been recommended Pappadeaux, I've been here several times and had already been a fan. I also invited a couple buddies so there was a lot of food to try. We started out with 1/2 doz Blue Point Oysters, really good! They are served on ice with several sauces and lemon wedges and are fresh and delicious. They also serve Gulf Coast Oysters but I love Blue Points. We all ordered Bloody Marys from the full bar, you can choose how spicy, these were very good. My Brother-In-Law started out with Boudin- a New Orleans chicken liver sausage, never tasted it before but I liked it. It has Creole spices on it which I liked (my Brother-In-Law by so much). He then ordered a Catfish Po' Boy- excellent. My other buddy order a Lobster Roll and enjoyed it, my other buddy ordered Blackened Catfish and commented it was still moist (they are often kinda dry) I ordered Lump Crab Cake and really liked it. Another round of Blue Points and we were full- no desert. The service is excellent, the Wait Staff wearing white shirts and black ties. It has a good handicap ramp out front leading into a garden area with a water feature where you can dine. Pappadeaux is a Winner!",

Our server was John and he could not of been better! We sat inside although it was a lovely day out. This place is decorated so beautifully , you forget you are in Phoenix. The outside Patio area is amazing and so peaceful. It really just adds to the wonderfulness of it all. Our food was divine! Really good. I started with a cup of the Seafood chowder. Even the Bread and Butter were great! For my meal I had Shrimp and Grits, so good! My friend had Tilapia with Hazelnuts. She let me have some. Oh my gosh! Divine, and I cannot wait to go back here. We even got Dessert and shared it , but we could not finish it all. It was such a large item. The Brownie cake it was.  Lots of parking here, Restrooms are clean and nicely decorated as well. The decor inside and outside is great. The staff are wonderful. I have always had a great experience here.",

    "text": "My Pappadeaux experiences have been different every time. But the negative has outweighed the positive. On a first visit a couple years ago I went with a group of friends and our children. We enjoyed various appetizers of Shrimp and Crawfish Fondeaux, Calamari and Fried Alligator - which the kids got a kick out of trying for the first time. All was tasty. I ordered a plank salmon with grilled asparagus. No complaints. We did have a mighty tasty watermelon cocktail that was refreshing and strong.   A second visit was a little less desirable. I was meeting a friend for happy hour. It was late afternoon...about 4:30 and it was quite packed. I had my 11 year (at the time) old daughter with me but she was being picked up by a friend on the way home from work so I could enjoy an outing with a girlfriend. There was a wait to be seated and we wanted to sit at the bar anyways. There were a few chairs and we took a seat. I ordered a chocolate milk for my daughter and was told by the bartender, 'she's not allowed to sit in this area'. I said, 'Really? She's being picked up in 15 minutes anyways so it won't be long. She's sitting here.' Not to mention there was a table right NEXT to the bar behind us with 2 children at it. I'm sure he just didn't want the seat taken by a child and reduce his drink orders...but he was rude about it and I wasn't pleased. Almost wanted to leave. The rest of the visit was decent. Had a cocktail and appetizer with the girlfriend and then left. Bartender continued to NOT be friendly.   3rd trip was a date night and my first time trying oysters. We ordered an appetizer to start and then a dozen oysters that came out later. My date gave me tips on how to eat. I enjoyed the first one. 2nd one we both ate...had debris, shell fragments, sand or whatever else might be in the oysters that aren't properly cleaned. We ended up returning the oysters and leaving disappointed and still hungry.",

As we walked to our table, I noticed that this place was packed.  Our server, Audrey, was right on top of things. She greeted us, asked if this was our first time and told us about the specials. She made us feel like we were invited to her house.  We started off with a small order of alligator which my wife and daughter have never tried. I told them it was like a very tender chicken nugget. They loved it., especially the bed of fried potatoe shavings. I loved the lettuce wedge and it's just as large as the one at Cheesecake Factory. My daughter ordered the Crispy Fried Shrimp. My wife had the Live Maine Lobster and I ordered the Cedar Plank Alaskan Salmon. The shrimp dish had butterflied shrimp with french fries and the main lobster was enjoyed, but I think I would have preferred the Caribbean lobster because the meat would be much firmer. My salmon was cooked just right, it only came with the asparagus which was nice and plump. I brought half of my dinner home. We finished off the dinner with a Key Lime pie which was delicious.  Our server had a keen eye. She automatically assumed that it was a birthday dinner, because she saw my wife reading a birthday card and opening her present from my daughter, and comp'd the desert. Audrey made our evening enjoyable and when we go back, we'll ask for her.",

Still, if you're ready to set aside the money to have a good night, you'll probably get it here.    The restaraunt is extremely customer-service oriented with very polite employees who attempt to fulfill all your needs.   They'll even offer suggestions on what items to select depending on what your party is looking for, very helpful!   On this particular trip I settled on the Crawfish Etouffee and ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar.  Between my meal and our appetizers (we went with the combo platter and pan-fried frog legs) I can say that I was totally satisfied by the end of the night.   Things were noisy but we were in the mood to relax and have fun and the atmosphere was certainly condusive to doing just that.     The food may not have been particularly authentic compared to real Cajun/Creole food but it was completely satisfying and I was surprised that my drink was relatively inexpensive for its size and for a bar inside a restaraunt in the middle of the city.   While it can get expensive fast at Pappadeaux, the folks here definitely earn their money.  The live music on the patio was certainly a plus as well.",

We ordered the appetizer that also came with a cheese crawfish n shrimp fondue that I wanted to pick up and drink straight out of the cup. The portions are absolutely amazingly enormous! I was stuffed after the appetizer that could have easily fed 4 people. I am so glad we decided to share our main entree (Pasta Mardi Gras). We enjoyed the little kick it had which we later found out from our waitress she specially adds a little chili flake. If you like the spice might want to ask. I was very appreciative of the mindfulness of our waitress as well as she split our meal for us. The atmosphere is a little loud but that has to be because people love this place. We went on a Saturday night at 10 pm and the place was still full. The hostess told us that they just got over a rush! That speaks volumes. I stand by what Rachel Ray says, \"You go where the lines are\" it means it's good!",

The service is always stellar, I have had the pleasure to talk to some of the new waiters in training and it is intense apparently. They have to have the menus memorized backwards and forwards and be able to answer just about any question you can think of on the spot.  However if I can give one piece of advise: Save room for dessert. Their dessert tray is to die for and they will bring it to your table so you can see everything on it and make your choice, then they will make you a fresh one of whatever you choose.  Pros:  Great for families Great food Amazing Service  Con: Kinda expensive on the wallet",

I'd like to go back on a calmer day to see if the quality was lacking because of the Mother's Day rush.",

But I want to address the service. Our server was a young man named Deon. He immediately developed a rapport with my mother-in-law, and he went out of his way to make her day a special one! In short, he treated her like a queen! He even sang her a song as well as joining in on 'Happy Birthday'! The rest of us also received wonderful service! His service was exceptional, even for Pappadeaux's! I had the opportunity to watch him wait on the other tables, and he was no less spectacular there!  Pappadeaux's is a favorite restaurant for this family, a place we can celebrate our milestones and special moments, and on Sunday we experienced a truly memorable time! Thank you Deon, you truly made her (and ours) a wonderful experience!  If you are going to Pappadeaux's ask to be seated in Deon's area, you will not be disappointed!",

I will always say Service can make and dinner experience great.   Ok now the appetizers mmmmm we started with the oysters Baton rogue, oysters Pappadeaux, and raw oysters on the half shell. All so good I wanted to stop my dinner experience because I thought the flavors could not get any better. I was wrong.   Then the main course the sea food platter. Each bite was fresh fish punching my taste buds with awesomeness. And the sheer amount of food was impressive I was expecting from a bougie place scrawny amounts none no the case. Who ever was cooking my vittles thank you.   Dessert To many choices, it was breaking my heart. I chose the banana pudding and it was the final knock out punch of a prize fight. I was down and out for the food coma.   Pappadeaux with ms. Woolridge and the quality of your food this hungry Hawaiian will be back to accept another food fight.",

The crab cakes were good in the middle but the outside of the cake (breading) made it seem like they were frozen before frying. Wasn't my favorite. I got a cup of the lobster bisque to start and it was a small portion for almost $12.  Everything seemed really over priced here. I ordered the filet Oscar medium rare with the butternut squash and green beans. The filet was cooked perfectly but the bearnaise sauce was not good. Didn't taste homemade. The veggies were really good too. The dessert selection is phenomenal. I barely had room but the group of us shared a large slice of the praline cheesecake. Really good!",

After I discovered this the place kind of lost its ambience and it fell further down on my eatery list.  My friend picked this spot for our monthly lunch date and I'm glad she did. I saw shrimp and grits on the menu and my heart skipped a beat. I've been to Nola twice and had shrimp and grits at the same place and the flavor was next level. As much as I was excited about seeing it on the menu I was also afraid it would not hold up to my Nola experience. Our waiter assured me it would.  Now let's talk about the wait staff. I liked my waiter so much I took a picture with him and if you read any of my other reviews or look at my pictures I don't take pics of waiters but he took such good care of us I had to give him a shoutout.   Ok back to the food. The shrimp and grits did NOT disappoint and as I closed my eyes I was teleported to Nola once more. My colleague had the tilapia and shrimp platter with green beans, I have no idea what butter they use but it was to die for.  Now time for dessert. I was stuffed but our waiter said since it was my first time I had to try the praline cheesecake. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but I trust my waiter and so far he's been spot on. One there's no way you can eat this thing in one sitting, it's HUGE. Two it was the best tasting cheesecake and the crust along with candied pecans and pralines gave me life.  Chain or no chain between the service, herbs and spices this place has won me over.",

She even boxed up our leftovers for us. The restaurant itself is very classy inside and out. The Cajun music was also a nice touch. The menu is extensive with many wonderful options. If you like seafood, I can't imaging not finding exactly what your in the mood for. Our meal was excellent. We had the grilled seafood platter and blackened salmon. As an appetizer, I ordered the lump crab with the grilled cheese garlic bread. OMG, I could eat that for my whole meal! I sure wish I knew what cheese was used. Definitely give that one a try!",

    "text": "It was my first time where with a large group and was really surprised with the atmosphere and food. Keep in mind that if you make a reservation, majority of your party size must be present in order to be sat. Otherwise, you'll have a 15 minute window for all of your party size to arrive otherwise they will give up the table. Aside from waiting over an hour cause my friends don't understand the concept of time, they have a large patio area great for waiting. We were then all sat in their wine room. A private room that is honestly really awesome. It's sound proof so y'all can wild out. Because it's also a wine room. Servers will come in and select wine so that can get kinda awkward sometimes. The food was great. Raw oysters tasted fresh and the horseradish and vinegar paired with it is amazing. The filet minions and lobster tail were some of the best I've had. Not bad of a place to come and eat with your friends. If you have a party of 10, try to get the wine room as it's more fun to just have a room to your party to keep it quiet. Will be going back soon.",

I can't remember what it was but boy oh boy it was suck your tongue down your throat and lick the bowl clean while waiting for the next bowl to come. I could eat that as an entree.   However, the seafood platter was not what I had envisioned. Especially after having that dip.  I was severely disappointed in the coating on the seafood.  That was the first time I've ever left seafood untouched.  That dip though...",

    "text": "Having lived in Houston where this corporation started, I have been to different types of restaurants the Pappas family runs (Mexican, Italian, Seafood), but hadr been to the one in Phoenix so.... This location was my choice for a birthday dinner, so we went and what a beautiful location it is (much like the ones in Houston but even nicer).  Packed at 4:30 pm already on a Friday night!  I chose the fried catfish and paid the tiny nominal charge for a fully loaded baked potato (which I never get, and heck! I'm eating those calories on my birthday).  Catfish cooked perfectly, but the only complaint I have is their tarter sauce is some canned and processed awful tasting stuff considering.  I have a better recipe for tarter at home, so I know it can be done in their kitchen.  They need to do alot better there. Other party had stuffed trout which was superb--and beautiful on the place.  Tasted wonderful, and wish I had gotten that now. Since it was a special dinner, I got a free dessert of my choice.  Not wanting to miss a calorie, got the brownie with ice cream to share with my partner--delicious, of course. Walked out like an old, fat drunk (I drank water, by the way), but was so stuffed I almost couldn't walk straight.  Good food. OK, the place is super loud, the service from Ron was super fantastic--and this place doesn't do the obnoxious thing of not wanting our coupon they send for the free dessert (and then ask for your driver's license to double-check it's really you which I have had happen before at another restaurant)--! Overall, good dinner...just a little bit too loud there which is disconcerting is all.  And get a new tarter recipe, Pappas!!!",

    "text": "To be truly honest, I would have to say good old Pappas has had a slight decline in service and food quality since its initial opening. This is especially apparent during its busy times, which is practically every lunch, evening and weekends. The wait time is ridiculous during these meal rushes.   The last two times that I was there in mid May and just a few weeks ago, my dinner companions and I haven't been able to sit in the normal dining area due to the millions of people already waiting before us. Now don't get me wrong, the patio and bar area are comfortable but sometimes you just want to sit at a normal table. I would definitely suggest trying to avoid the lunch and dinner crowds, by either showing up once they open their doors or maybe and hour or two before they close them, just about any other time outside of that its going to be a mad house in this place. Another thing about seating, on occasion the host or hostess will try to seat you at a back table next to the restrooms. If you're uncomfortable with that (being a 'germ-phobic' person or just don't like the close proximity of the restroom and its visitors) you can ask for another table, they may shoot you a dirty look, but they'll reseat you elsewhere.   Now to talk about the food. I haven't strayed from my usual dishes all that much, but they're are quite a few for them to be usuals. I would have to say, I'm quite a fan of the hot and fresh bread (on some days it is) and a bowl of their Crawfish bisque. Another favorite of mines is the Salmon Salad, sometimes they under cook the salmon despite how I tell the waiter/waitress for them to have the chef cook it throughly. Other days I'm quite keen on the Po'boys, I jump between a catfish and shrimp combo and an oyster and shrimp combo. Here as well, I tell the waite/waitress that I'd like my oysters fried \"hard\" (if I wanted them soupy, I would have ordered them right out the half shell) to avoid a soggy Po'boy and I'd have to say 5/10 times they actually did listen and the oysters didn't soggy up the sandwich.   I have a knack of making the appetizers meals. One of my new usuals has been the fried alligator and I would have to say, it is pretty good, but I don't like how they go skimpy on the shoe string fries. Those things are too good to hold back on! Before the alligator came along, I use to order the fried crawfish appetizer, which is about the only dish there besides some of the desserts that I have nothing to complain about it.   And oh my if you think the dessert tray looks good, it tastes even better. I have had everything on there that doesn't have chocolate in it or on it. The sweet potato pecan pie, I must say is one of my favorites, the creme brulee, for the few times I have had it, is scrumptious, and I love Nila Waffers, so the banana pudding is pretty yummy if you like bananas and pudding.   So, if you catch Pappas on a good day and time, I would say you're looking at a 5-star rated dining experience. But if its busy, crowded and the kitchen and staff are overwhelmed you may be looking at a 3.5 or a 4.",

For the prices, we expected better.  We each had a drink but, the glasses were filled with ice & just a sliver of liquor. We all ran out of drinks, including water & iced tea, as our server never checked on us. Everything is ala carte, with a baked potato being an extra $2.60 & even though we asked for butter & sour cream, the potatoes were dry. Our friend's wife ordered a dinner salad which did not come until after the entrees were served & she asked about it. As it was a different server who delivered our entrees, he had to tell our server who, upon finally delivering the salad, lied saying she, \"had to yell at the kitchen\" for it.  My shrimp, which I was told would be large & butterflied, were as small as popcorn shrimp & our friend's scallops were undercooked.  She did mention this to the server but, at no time did the server offer to get the manager to make it right.  $250.00 meal. I will not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in here on Saturday night after the D'Backs game and were told there would be an hour and half wait.  The very visually frazzled hostess kept her composer and let us know that the bar area is first come first serve so we decided to try there.  We scored some seats within 10 minutes and were immediately met by Sarah the bartender and the smiles and service never stopped.  Based on our questions Sarah knew it was our first time and really explained their menu and how everything works.  Our whisky was 10$ a glass but based on the \"long pour\" it was worth it.  There was a mistake in the kitchen and someone miss ordered a crab legs, we scored because Sarah brought them to us to try.  AMAZING... I ordered a sampler trio as our appetizer and the wife loved it all until she realized it was not breaded chicken and little chunks of lobster in the seafood fondue (I may have led her on a little) but rather alligator and crawfish.  The smile on her face (maybe the whisky) or just the general fun atmosphere and the food quality was well worth the total bill at the end of the night.  I can't wait to go back...",

Service ~ fair: our host never established eye contact and it felt as though we were being seated at a buffet. Our server - although very nice, was inept. Appetizers took 30 min to arrive, then she asked if it would be okay the serve our main courses at the same time. We said no and continued. We finished our appetizers and about 20 min. later the server made to back to our table. Our main course meals were horrible both overcooked overcooked, reheated or whatever, not edible. We spoke with the manager, returned the food, paid and left. The bill would have been $100.+ for very substandard food but the manager did credit us for the bad food. Our server never offered to refill our drinks (beer and mixed drink) pure profit for the biz. We left once again disappointed with service and food. The thing is my wife wants to give it a (perhaps final) try again today (about 3 months from the last visit. I will report back",

    "text": "My first experience with Pappadeaux was ~6 years ago, just after moving to Phoenix (I worked nearby and drove past it every day). Try as I might, the only remarkable thing I can recall about that meal was the alligator and was unimpressed with how chewy 'gator is.  Fast forward to the present: five stars for ambience and freshness of seafood, three for value, one for finding a myriad of extraneous items in my entree. I had ordered the Blackened Catfish Opelousas (with oysters, shrimp & crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice). I found a mini pearl (which I promptly lost when it rolled off my napkin) and sliver of something hard like shell in the butter sauce, and a small oddly shaped nugget of God-knows-what in the dirty rice. I'm still confused by that last unknown item. No, it wasn't an uncooked grain of rice; it was shaped somewhat like a dreidel and about the size of a mustard seed. It was in one of the last bites of food on my plate and left a poor impression in my mind as I left.  The girlfriend and I ordered bloody marys and a dozen oysters on the half shell LONG before our waiter returned for taking our entree request. Drinks came first, then an apology about why it was taking so long to get the oysters shucked. On the second return to apologize for the delay, we put in the rest of our order. A third return to apologize included a loaf of their french bread. The bread was phenomenal, and went well with our bloody mary drinks - but between their house bloody mary and the Absolut Cajun Bloody Mary, go with the house version. It's $2 cheaper and virtually no difference in spiciness - which was a disappointment to me because I really like bloody marys to be quite spicy. The oysters arrived a few minutes before our entree, and at $9.95 per dozen they're a rockin' bargain despite their delivery being late.  I don't understand how people think this is a cheap place to eat. All one has to do is go to their website to see prices up front. Entrees are generally priced $19.95 - $24.95, although steak items are significantly higher. Adding a drink - not your obligatory diet Coke, but a REAL drink - and tax, AND tip, pushes the price easily into a 3-dollar sign tier. Unless, of course, people opt for the cheapest items on the menu, ask only for water, and tip a mere 10%.  I'll return, but only for happy hour and cheap oysters.",

So I complained and the manager did nothing and her excuse for doing nothing was lame! Manager, Kathy Belford, her excuse was this is a family restaurant . Like it's a Pieter piper pizza, which I would expect at Peter piper pizza. I spent with tip, $145.47....... Papadeaux thanks for the wonderful entertainment not I'm never coming back!!!

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I don't like chains, but I do like Pappas. However, living in California, I rarely have a chance to patronize them. Was in town visiting this past weekend, so I finally had my chance. Turns out that we liked it so much on Saturday that we came back again the next night on Sunday!  In order to avoid the wait. we had reservations both times. On Saturday, Andres C. Rodriguez was singing and playing some beautiful acoustic guitar, so we decided to sit outside to listen. Even though it was over 80 degrees, it was OK, since the sun wasn't on us. Colin was our server, and he did a great job. Good selection of local beers on tap in 18 and 12 ounce sizes.  Started with Oysters Pappadeaux with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise, which was absolutely insane! Mom and I agreed that it may indeed have been the best single dish that we have ever eaten and a good value at $13.95 for six. Despite the cooking, the oysters were still juicy and not overdone. I had the amazing Seafood Platter, which included Fried tilapia, shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with French fries. So much food...I couldn't finish it! Had the fries and one of the tilapia fillets for breakfast! The tilapia was very lightly breaded and perfectly fired. Still very juicy inside. Perhaps the best fried fish anywhere. Mom had sauteed soft shell crabs with dirty rice. No...room...for...dessert!   On Sunday, we went inside. Nice cozy, dark space. We tried to be clever, but we still over-ordered. Started with the complimentary warm baguette and the small Greek salad, which was expertly assembled table-side and was 100% crisp and fresh. Shared a full bowl of seafood gumbo. Amazing flavor, with okra, crab and tons of shrimp! Followed by Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes over crawfish in a light butter sauce ($23 for two) They were served with a garnish of potato sticks and a bit over-wrought for my taste. No need for breading...these deserve to be broiled. Loved the sauce...mopped it all up!  For our entree, we ordered the Crawfish sampler which was half fried crawfish and half Crawfish etouffee over dirty rice. Took a few bites of the fried while it was warm. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. No need for extra sauces. Took the rest to-go. Etouffee had tons of large, juicy tails. It was delicious, even when re-heated in a microwave (I know, god forbid!!!)  One of the good parts about a chain is consistency, in food quality and service. Both were made very clear at this location. The prices aren't cheap, but it's not ridiculous either. Both times, our bill for two, with drinks was in the $90 range. Wish I lived closer. I'm now dying to find proper Gulf Coast seafood in Los Angeles...it's not easy!",

We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated very quickly.  We didn't love where we were seated though, feeling as though we were in the middle of a walkway.  The dining room wasn't very full when we arrived, so we think we could have been seated in a less busy location, but it is what it is.    We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and we're a bit disappointed in the size for the price.  There was a lot of just batter prices and fried artichokes (something we'd never had in calamari before), and not as much actual calamari.  We were concerned that our entree might be lacking too, but they most definitely were not.  I ordered the Texas redfish Pontchartrain which was delicious!  It came in a le!on butter sauce with some shrimp and crabmeat and dirty rice.  Hubby ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette, which was bacon wrapped shrimp filled with Monterey Jack and a jalapeno sliver with dirty rice.  He really enjoyed his as well.  The entrees were a great size.  For dessert we had creme brulee, which was very good too.    Overall, a very good meal and we will probably return, although we're not likely to order the calamari again.  And really, we didn't need an appetizer because they brought out warm, crusty French bread and that is really all the appetizer we needed.",

The place was busy, but not too busy where it was too loud to have a conversation. The date was a success given how our server, Josh (remembered the name written on the order card placed on the table) made it amazing. As it was my dates first time here, he gave him a good introduction to the menu and the specials. He also gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and decide what to get. Our food was delicious and gave us leftovers for days. He even remembered my dates side of green beans he didnt get upon serving our food when we both didn't. The wow factor that earned him a 20% tip was that when he was about to pack up our leftover banana pudding, which was divine btw, someone took it and threw it away. So he got a new one made for us on the house and split it in both takeout boxes so me and date had half each to take. My date thoroughly enjoyed his food (and enjoyed the stuffed crab I had as part of my meal) and he would definitely come back again sometime. Great service throughout my meal and the table wait bartending service when we had a pre dinner drink.",

I had shrimp etouffe was good and spicey decent portion  gumbo was awesome  (small portion) we were in the wine room which was wonderful because it was private except for servers getting wine every once and a while. Well worth it, the restaurant itself large vibrant bar activity and people watching on a Friday night was great. Diverse crowd was beautiful. Keely the manager also was very nice.",

Reservations were out of the question so we were put on the wait list. We waited about 2 hours before we were seated. But hey it is what it is! Once we were seated things started running like clockwork. Like I said the place was bursting outside of the seams. However our server treated us like we were the only people in the house. Its been over a year since our visit. The food was good,  I totally forgot what we ordered with the exception of  a Greek Salad that I split with my brother. It was massive. So 5 stars here...We are visiting Phoenix in July. I will be calling ahead for reservations and plan on going to lunch as well as dinner.",

Having lived in Louisiana for 18 years, this place doesn't do Cajun a whole lot of justice. Yet it's always packed which makes it less appealing in my book. There is no desirable ambiance and the tables are snugged up together too tight to make conversion at your own enjoyable.  There are more atmosphere friendly places in the valley with much better food and much better prices, like Baby Kay's. Spices are much more spot on as well.",

And this place is always busy, so you can expect a few hiccups with service being slow, or your waiter forgetting something simple like bread or silverware or water.  They are trained well, but I think are often overwhelmed, often times you have to ask someone to come remove plates to make room for new stuff, once again if they were not so busy or had a few dedicated bussers, I don't think this would be an issue. But alas it is.   Food, the food is just OK, I know people that rave over it, I just don find it that appealing, I am a huge fan of gumbo, so the last time I was here, I ordered the shrimp gumbo, only to end up almost cracking my tooth on a piece of bone from god knows what was in my gumbo. It might have even been a piece of the bowl as far as I know...  This last time similar experience got the rainbow trout and shrimp, Loaded with butter almost drowned it, and bones thru out...does not make for a good dining experience. This place is ok, but for the prices I would expect more attention to be placed to small details. Will go here if invited but have experienced better seafood places throughout the valley. And if I had to choose I would go there instead.",

Ok Yelpers by far this is the worst pappadeux I've ever been to! The waiter we had was horrible the food was cold. I just can believe that I'm writing a bad review. The service was so bad that we did a FIRST, ZERO TIP... Let me explain. My moms order was totally wrong.  She ordered catfish and got crawfish yes they both start w a \"C\" but she also said blackened so that should've said she wasn't saying crawfish. Ok skip the fact that we were never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers, he just bought us water. Then after eating COLD food we asked for to go boxes. Waite boxed our food and just scrapped everything off the plate including garnishes into the to go box, mixed all the food together. I'm talking catfish tomato shrimp and rice and everything all together and basically said \"HERE\" don't ask me what my waiter looked like bc he didn't spend more than 5 min total at our table. Maybe it was my waiter but ILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT (in Phoenix) EVER!",

I initially called to make my reservation, within seconds of speaking with an employee, I received a text confirming my reservation. I received a text a day prior to my reservation as a reminder. I thought all of that was very cool.   Walking into this restaurant, I was shocked to see how full it is. Which leads me to my review...   Let's have a seat, shall we?!  We started off with the Calamari. Large sized. Which cracked me up when it got to the table. The large size looked like the medium size. So I'm not sure I would want to see what the medium size looked like. Was it a \"large size\" because it had two small bite size pieces of fried zuchinni? The calamari, which I heard was the very best, was mediocre at best. It wasn't all it was made out to be. The little fried bits tasted like churches chicken. Not cute.   Onto my main course. I got the Mardi Gras pasta thing. It sounded amazing, looked amazing, smelled amazing, however, it wasn't as good as I had hoped.   As with other reviews I read, the lobster tail is overcooked. It tasted as if it was previously frozen, cooked, and then left under a heat lamp until it was chosen.   The cheesecake slice for desert was massive, it was ok.   Our waiter, John, was great. He was at our table at appropriate moments. He wasn't over bearing, or no where to be found.   All in all, I wouldn't go skipping to this place. It wasn't what I had imagined. I will not be back, thumbs down.",

The server described it as more of a spread and she was right! It was so thick and had chunks of crab meat. It was so savory and decadent. We had never had dirty rice so the waitress brought out a \"sample\" of it. First of all it was basically a side of rice and second it was DELICIOUS! We finished the whole side and also got it with our meal. I got sea bass and my husband had a scallop, shrimp and mahi mahi combo. Everything was excellent! I'm such a fan of this great, fresh seafood! Not to mention, the excellent customer service was so refreshing.",

Our server a young black gurl, very curtious, helpful, knowledgeable, and on point with our drinks never had an empty glass to drink what ever it was. Kudos for the great service and amazing food. I cannot wait to come back n taste all the other food on the menu. It is a lil pricey so bring ur wallet but the portions are good.

When my family and I moved to the Los Angeles area, we were deeply saddened there were no Pappas restaurants in Southern Cali. The nearest one is Phoenix.....so what do we do??? We plan our trip to Phoenix just to eat at Pappadeaux! Not even kidding!!   We made reservations for a Saturday night , 7/22/2017, at 7:30pm and the evening started out horribly. Our server didn't smile, didn't share her name, didn't welcome us, nor did she take our drink order for the first 17 minutes of us being seated. The entire time, my family and I are saying, we drove over 300 miles, we are NOT going to allow one server to ruin our evening. My kids were asking, Mom, when is she going to offer us bread or water? She never did. After I flagged her down so she could finally take our order, her demeanor was even more negative. Even after all of this horrible service, we were still holding out for a better outcome.....until she disrespected my husband in front of my family. My husband asked for butter for our daughters entree because this is the way it's served in Houston. Our server immediately says, \"we're not in Houston, but I'll get it for you anyway.\" And that was it!! We were done... my husband got up to get the manager.  Even though our evening started off on a rough note, Keely Cambridge made us feel sooooo much better. She apologized and made us feel so welcomed. She made our evening spectacular. She also changed our server to Cristil, who catered to us! Thank you Keely and Cristil for turning our lemons into lemonade! We will be back soon",

The only seafood tasting thing in it was the clump of lobster in the middle. Lobster is sopose to be the main spotlight of this dish, but the ingredient that stood out like a sore thumb was the green bell pepper. Sooooo much green bell pepper that's all you tasted besides salt. Gross.  Other then that dinner was very nice.  The salmon was cooked medium rare, so it was super tender with a crispy crust. The giant shrimp and grits was super super salty but totally yummy. I would totally order again and just ask for no additional salt when plating. We also had the shrimp and crawfish fondue. It was a very large appetizer.  Very yummy.  Too full for dessert but they were reasonably priced. The service was fast and our server was very informative and polite. Be prepared to spend about 100$ for 2 people.  It's pretty expensive but you will love the freshness of the seafood.",

The key to a good experience here is \"Reservation!\" You don't have a Reservation you could be waiting for an hour to hour and half for a table. We ordered gulf oyster on the half shell it comes with horseradish/ketchup/cilantro base soy  dressing on the side and I love mixing the sauces it was very good. I had the Alaskan King Crab legs and they were so fresh and sweet and just right. My fiance had the Branzino with grilled shrimp and Broccolini in a herb lemon butter sauce it was yum! Check it out it! It's a fun experience also this place comes with a heavy bill at the end of the night so be prepared! Happy Eats!",

My husband and I split The sampler platter and my daughter ordered a crab and shrimp appetizer with a side salad with ranch dressing. We ordered water and our waiter Andrew brought us sliced lemon on the side. We informed Andrew that my daughter has Celiac Disease and he explained the manager would be coming over to talk with us about the issue. The manager was very nice to us -- she wanted to make sure the food organization der was clear due to my daughter's Celiac Disease. Our waiter, Andrew was very friendly; the atmosphere in the restaurant was great. We were seated by the window by a really nice hostess.  The food was fresh, hot and delicious. Pappadeaux is a nice place to dine whether for lunch or dinner. I highly recommend this seafood dining establishment.",

If you see the soft-shell crab available and do not order it, you will regret it more than any other mistake you made in your life, the moments you are eating it will literally be the highlight of your life.   tl;dr get the softshell crab",

    "text": "We really enjoyed eating here. I have heard of this restaurant for years and never come until yesterday. I had heard it can take a while time get seated because it's popular. We were seated right away.   The restaurant is big and has plenty of seating so I imagine the special occasions and maybe evenings would be the only time you'd have to actually wait to be seated. We came at lunch time on a Saturday and it was fine.    Our waiter was super nice and explained things. He didn't ask us how the food was with our mouths full of food. They give you like a loaf of bread and butter to get things started lol.  I got the pasta Mardi gras and my gf got the shrimp and grits - both were lunch specials. The total was about 42 bucks prior to tip. We didn't get anything but water to drink. So that gives you an idea how much it costs to eat here.   As far as the food goes I liked both of our meals. I've never really cared for grits but they make theirs different. It has all sorts of flavor mixed in. Portions were good.   We had some of the praline cheesecake as well - to go, because I was stuffed but the dessert looked legit. It was comped by the manager because it was our first time here :) I'm not sure if I'm to share that, but it was totally a surprise and made a good experience even better.   The sauce on the cheesecake had a rum flavor to it and it was awesome. It would have been about 7 bucks for a big slice.   The restaurant itself is cool. I wouldn't say it's super fancy like Flemings where you'll feel weird wearing jeans. So you can come causal or dressed up and you'll be good.   We'll definitely come back to try some more of the food. We were spying on other people's food and it all looked good.",

I have been with my family and loved ones more times than I could count because one thing I can count on it that the food and service will always be the best. I subscribe to their email notifications so I received the offer for discounted oysters which are one of my favorite items on the menu because they serve with not only lemon and cocktail sauce but now two other delicious sauces. I have tried many things that you would not be able to try elsewhere such as grouper, quail, raw oysters, frog legs, red snapper, and even a mixed seafood fondue! This is such a great spot if you love seafood like I do. My favorite thing on the menu is the red fish! They have it two ways and both are amazing it is such a great fish. Especially how they cook it. They also serve dirty rice! Which is a Cajun style rice that is so good! Pairs very well with the sauces that creep over from the fish entrees. I will never stop going here though they have changed a few things on the menu since I first started going years ago!!! Such an amazing spot 10/10 would always recommend.",

The food was a bit spicy and I took back the crawfish etouffee which was not tasty at all. I have been here with friends before and had a seasonal dish I loved. I came back this time and my husband liked his catfish dish. I was not to keen on my dish and it was replaced for free but it was spicy and my daughter took hers home and threw it away, it was the Mardi gra pasta or something like that. It had sausage, crawfish and shrimp but it was a bit to spicy. The service was awesome and he was fast and friendly. We didn't get dessert at the end. The waiter did take off the crawfish etouffee and my meal but neither one of us liked it. I like spice but I like to enjoy my meal without my mouth on fire. I usually don't like to complain as I know it is a hassle.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed with this place it's honestly ridiculous.  We showed up with a party of 7 because I was celebrating my birthday. I let them know this when we made the reservation. First, our table wasnt ready and we had to stand around waiting for them to get it together. Then, when we arrived at our table our server took forever to arrive. We ordered our drinks and it took 30 freaking minutes to get just drinks.  When they finally arrived only half the table had even had a chance to request drinks so obviously the other half wanted them. Because of the slow service of getting them I advised everybody to order their food now just in case the food was just as slow. We ordered the lobster bisque which when it came was fishy smelling and required seasoning. The gumbo that was a joke! It tasted like a bland progresso soup version of gumbo. The crab cake was drowned in butter and had no seasoning and for almost 20 bucks a cake this is asinine. The lemon butter chicken pasta dish (cant remember the exact name)  was also bland and tasted of neither lemon or butter. The fried catfish and crawfish was over cooked and bland. The crab puffs were also bland. The best part of the whole meal was the lobster artichoke dip. Our server was rude and careless. He forgot to put in one of the drink orders  Now mind you at this point the first half got their drinks after 30 minutes,  these never came and we were halfway through our awful meal. He came back to the table and admitted to forgetting them and it still took 10 more minutes to get them. He said he would comp the drinks and didnt rudely stating they \"cant give anything away\". Honestly this whole experience but a whole cloud over my whole birthday evening. I expected much MUCH better from a place of this calibre.",

    "text": "Let me start by stating we have been going to Pappadeaux for many years. We wanted to celebrate our 54th anniversary with a nice dinner and we chose Pappadeaux. My wife needs a walker to move around, so when the hostess went to seat us I asked for one of the three empty tables right by the door.  She then proceeds to walk us to the back and when I stopped her and said I want one of these tables she got annoyed, really.  So now we are greeted by our waiter, nice friendly guy. takes our drink order and returns with them. He never brings us water or asks if we want water, no big deal. He takes our dinner order and my wife ordered crab legs de-shelled. I order a shrimp dinner, we both ordered Caesars salads. We got our salads and he never asked if we wanted fresh ground pepper on them which is kinda the norm for those salads, and before we were finished with them, our dinner came out, boy, bums rush tonight I thought.  So I said he could take mine but my wife was no where finished.  But when he put her dinner down, the crab legs were not de-shelled and so he had to take them back and said it would be just a couple of minutes, so my wife got to finish her salad.  Meanwhile her side dish was left on the table and I waited before starting to eat as I wanted to eat with my wife. Well the 2 minutes turned into seven minutes and I started to eat as my food was getting cold as was my wife's side dish. We finished dinner and asked if we wanted dessert. My wife asked if it was free and he said it would be so we accepted. Very disappointing dinner for us and not the norm for Pappadeaux.  I believe our server Matthew should go back into training as he was not ready for prime time.  He really made our dinner very disappointing. I hope this is not a trend for Pappadeaux. The food is always very good and don't let our bad experience deter  you from trying it for dinner, although It will be awhile before we return anytime soon. Not all their servers are Matthews.",

The bread served before the meal was crusty and delicious. My catfish sandwich was perfectly cooked and was perfectly seasoned, needing no enhancements to give it flavor.

Complimentary bread was placed on table after having to ask & a hour later.   I ordered the shrimp and grits- wasn't the best. Shrimp was great! Well seasoned and cooked perfect temp but the grits were thick and lacked depth of flavor. The spinach side was kinda random & was just soggy & unseasoned.   I cant remember what everyone else ordered exactly but there was an order of Pasta, tilapia something, salmon steak with shrimp & then i forget the other.   Overall everyone was really underwhelmed and it was disappointing considering how excited we all were.",

I felt that we got way more food than we could eat and for a very reasonable price. I know some of the reviews say otherwise but we couldn't finish our Seafood Grill (skewers) or our Grouper with Shrimp and we didn't have any apps or salad!   The outdoor patio is awesome, they've got misters to keep you cool!!  Check it out if you're in Nth Phoenix, it's more of a destination, it's off the beaten path but it's worth it!",

You can sit at the bar if you are dining alone, but be sure to come hungry because they serve great food in large portions and serve refreshing and creative cocktails.   If you come with a small or large party, sharing is a good idea, especially the appetizers, so you have the opportunity to try different items on the menu.  The crispy southern fried quail was tender and fried perfectly.  The shrimp and crawfish fondeux was absolutely delicious if you love dipping bread in a wonderful cheesy sauce.  I still ordered their Texas Redfish Pontchartrain as an entree which was more that I could eat, but was wonderfully prepared.   We had no room for dessert, but if you dare, be prepared for a giant \"Claim Jumper\" sized serving.  Great New Orleans-style restaurant with cocktails, seafood, steaks, and good service for overall value!",

Most places when you go in for a birthday party it may take forever to get drinks, but not here.   I had the Shrimp and Grits and it was SO GOOD! I was definitely full quick, and I still had left overs. The shrimps are pretty giant and you get about five or six. The only down fall was the pile of spinach (or whatever it was) on the side, didn't taste as well. The grits were on point, it had some creamy corn to it, loved!  To drink I had the Henny Penny and the Garden of Eden. The Henny Penny was so good, it waste too strong rather a bit sweet. It was perfect for me. The Garden or Eden taste more like cucumber than not, and I really didn't taste much alcohol, bummer! Won't order that one again, unlike the Henny Penny.",

They have a menu that is ever changing so some options are only available for a limited time.   Not a fan of their bread that they bring out before the appetizer, salads, and entrees. I do believe a lot of their competition offers better bread. That being said the New England Lobster Bites were swimming with flavor as the lemon garlic butter sauce, spinach and those that love grilled cheese bread brought it all out. Wish there was more lobster for the price paid at $32.  I ordered the Pappardelle Pasta which was pretty decent but not my favorite thing that I have had here. Their pasta dishes are always changing and I can never find the first pasta that I ordered, always chasing it. The Atlantic Salmon Alexander has real flavor to it and a slight kick but definitely good for those that love salmon, shrimp, scallops and crawfish.  If you haven't tried this franchise out yet in a state near you then I would strongly suggest stopping in and seeing what it is all about.",

And for that I am extremely thankful. Luz Helena delivered with lots of smiles and a bunch of patience. My favorite dish last time was a failure... But today was the most exquisite dish.

    "text": "I'd always wanted to go to this famed seafood spot. I've heard it was one of the best seafood spots in town. It was a bit of a far drive but oh well. The place was HUGE. It was very beautiful, with peaceful water features and lovely green leaves trailing about everywhere outside. It was quite hot however, so my love and I opted to eat inside. I liked the decor and ambience. It definitely seemed like a special date night spot type of place with how dim and intimate it was. Tori was our server and she was friendly, helpful and accommodating. The menu was pretty extensive and had lots of seafood options. Pricing was a bit on the high side, everything on the menu was mostly $12 and up, with mains being $25 and above. My bf got a Surfside Soda as a drink and it tasted refreshingly perfect. It was made of house-made passion fruit, pineapple and strawberry syrup, vanilla, fresh lemon juice and soda mixed together.   To start, they brought out a complimentary crusty loaf of bread. It was hot and toasted to my liking, with creamy yummy butter to spread on it. However they didn't bring out a bread knife so we made do with ripping bits off the loaf with our fingers. Not sure if this was supposed to be the usual practice. They were having a $9.95 one-dozen Blue Point oyster special so I immediately went for it. They brought it out promptly. However, My love didn't like oysters so I ate all twelve of them myself! I liked the variety of sauces given; there were three: ketchup with horseradish, some sweet-garlic sauce, and another sauce I didn't know. My favorite sauce was the slightly sweet one.. I wished there was Thousand Island sauce, which is my favorite to eat with fresh oysters! The oysters were pretty good and I of course doused them with Tabasco sauce. My bf opted for the crispy fried alligator. It was delicious and I loved the sauce that came with it (not sure what it was but it was sweet, not overly so though). It also came with little crispy potato sticks? (Think deconstructed hash browns) I felt they complemented the dish nicely. My bf however felt the dish was average. I think he thought alligator would taste more special/different? I, however, was happy with it.    For mains, my bf got the Chef's Selection Stuffed Rainbow Trout: a pan-grilled trout with wilted greens, butternut squash and jumbo lump crab with pecan brown butter. I got one of the Pappadeaux Classics: the Atlantic Salmon Alexander dish. It was either that or the Mississippi Catfish Opelousas. Tori suggested the former, so I got a 7-ounce blackened salmon with shrimp, scallops and crawfish in a white-wine cream sauce with dirty rice. My bf's dish was delectable, with the skin of the fish delightfully crispy to perfection. I enjoyed the brown butter sauce and the pecans and capers that added to the flavor of the dish. I didn't like the wilted greens that much; however, that was more of a personal preference than anything really.   My dish was yummy, just as Tori suggested! The creamy sauce wasn't overly-rich or overpowering, but complemented the seafood and dirty rice perfectly. I savored every mouthful. At that point of the meal we were sooo stuffed and couldn't eat any more. We couldn't even finish the alligator appetizer! I felt quite sad because I'd heard rave reviews of their desserts. Nonetheless, I resolved to definitely come back to try more dishes next time. I would advise coming with a big group because then everyone can share and try new things. We brought back tons of leftovers and were happy with our night. Service was good as well. I can't wait to return!   Please note serving sizes here are pretty large, and portions are generous. I would advise sharing food unless you want to bring home lots of food!",

    "text": "Yesterday was my very first time going to Pappadeaux's for lunch. I loved the entrance and walk way are. Very vintage New Orleans vibe and so beautiful. I have no seen that many green plants in Arizona, but I saw many here just walking into the restaurant.   I ordered fried alligator, Oysters, Craw-fish Antufee, and the most amazing of them ALL; Grouper with Crab Crust  I loved every part of this entire meal. I had wonderfully made drinks as well.  The grouper was cooked to perfection and the crab crust with Almonds was breath taking. I loved every second of that meal.   I recommend you try the Pineapple Mule. It was very refreshing and perfect to drink in this hot weather.   The scenery, decorations, and the ambiance of the entire restaurant was classy but fun and lively!   The staff was so professional and they deserved and worked very hard for that Tip.   It was nice and cool inside and there was even a section I saw that you can watch sports at.   Please check this place out for a nice,, classy date.",

    "text": "Pappadeaux's is by far my favorite seafood splurge in AZ! Although this place is a chain the customer service is always excellent as well as the food. I've been here many times and have never had anything I didn't think was extraordinary. This last time I went I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee with Dirty rice; every bite was loaded with crawfish it was so much I could only eat half. It was fairly priced at $20.95, which at any other restaurant I would tucked my tail and hide but the food here is well worth the price. For appetizers my favorites include the Lobster Bisque, Fried Alligator and Crab Fingers. The only thing I don't like about Pappadeaux's is they don't have free refills on the Strawberry Lemonade.  Which again is fantastic, it has a delicate balance of sweet and sour but the glass is so loaded with ice you're literally paying $3.50 per glass on about  cups of actual juice.  The atmosphere is fun the lighting is more on the dim side but it fits the New Orleans theme throughout the restaurant. This place handles large crowds like a champ, my group this past Saturday was a party of 12 and the server had no problems with remembering who ordered what, as well as properly splitting the check. I highly recommend the restaurant to any seafood lover. If you don't like seafood there are a few other options but not many; the few they have are well executed. I also recommend trying out the Chef's Special of the Night. This place has an outdoor patio and the band is always playing on the weekend which serves as great entertainment when waiting for your table.",

    "text": "if you're looking for authentic cajun, this is not the place.  it's more like Joe's Crab Shack with a Louisiana theme.  overpriced food, the servers/bartenders are too busy to be attentive .  I ordered a special redfish dish (which was not cheap) and the redfish had either been frozen for a long time or, most likely, microwaved.  tis was the deal-breaker.  everything was decent until I got my entree but eating rubbery-textured redfish was not a great way to top off a meal.  I have spent some time in New Orleans and LOVE cajun food and this place does it no justice!  and for what you have to pay for the food, you can pretty much fly to N'Awlins and have the real deal.",

    "text": "Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.  Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum.",

Did not disappoint as usual.  The hot loaf of bread with butter is always a good start to get my taste buds going. Of course, I fill up too much on it to get to dessert.  My hubby and I normally start with a dozen of raw oysters and they have been consistently fresh and briny. Then we have a few appetizers as our meal. The frog legs have been great and have a light spicy kick. The Fried calamari is light, crunchy and not over fried (like the addition of the artichoke hearts mixed in with the calamari).  This time I had the Costa Rican Tilapia Lafayette. It was perfectly done (I hate over cooked fish) and the sauce was plate lickin' good. My hubby had the Pasta Mardi Gras and he gave it the thumbs up. I gave it a taste and it was very flavorful with the Andouille sausage and in a very rich cream sauce.  We'll be back soon so I can try more items off the large menu!",

We were seated just on the other side of the kitchen, right below the window to look inside of it. We told our server who got the manager. He said \"oh it's just a stink bug\" and grabbed it with a tissue and threw it away. We asked for a new table and he went to find a new one. While he was gone (about 3 minutes) another critter started crawling up the wall and went right under the wood by the window into the kitchen area. At that point we just left. It was really disgusting. We have always loved their food, but I think it's going to be a very long time before we can go back there and we will not recommend this place to anybody again.",

It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.",

I am addicted to the mudbugs and have been to Pappadeauxs 5 times since mid March to get my fill of them.  The bartenders recognize me by now.  I have been going in every season for the past 4-5 years.  Usually I sit at the bar and find the service to be friendly and top notch.  I most often start with a half dozen raw oysters and then move on to the crawfish.  Oh, boy, are they good and go perfectly with an ice cold Shiner Bock draft!   Took my mom last week and we sat at the bar.  Had some mussels to start.  Very good again.  Even though this place is packed every time I go in, there never seems to be a break in the service quality.  I have also been in recently with a large group and sat in the dining room.  Fantastic meal.  We all had something different and everyone was pleased.  A little loud for my liking but that is to be expected when a place is as busy as this restaurant always seems to be.

He added some details about this resturant and the food was mostly southern themed. Also, the cost is a bit pricey but worth the trip to dine there. I decided to read up the reviews and did some light skimming based on people's experiences here.  Finally, on our anniversary we drove up to papadeux which was around 8 - 8:30 when we got there. Luckily, they closed at 10pm so *whew*. lol.   I already knew what I wanted due to looking at other people's reviews on which entrees were good.   The place was really lovely and words can't describe how romantic this could be coming here on our first anniversary *hearts*  When we arrived, it was pretty empty and very dim too, I wasn't sure how to take it but I was just nervous and excited to arrive to such a lovely and uppity place.   We were seated immediately and our waiter was Johnny. I really loved our waiter! He was very attentive, very well mannered and had a really good intuition which he could anticipate our expectations and such. I was so awed and wowed by this waiter and there couldn't be anything more lovely then having a wonderful and smooth service.  He asked if this was our first time here and I mentioned that my boyfriend has been here once but this is my first time so Johnny came around my side and opened up my menu and just went through each section of the menu and explained a bit of some of the popular dishes for each category. Which i loved! *hearts*  so I picked out an appetizer, I don't remember what the name of the appetizer was but it was really good! I had the lobster bisque soup with lobster chunks in it....oh man that was soooooooooooo delicous and the lobster was a bit chewy but still tastey!   Then I had the costa rican naked tilapia the 7oz, now that was seriously good *drools*  But in between our dishes, johnny kept checking up on us and communicating about our food and the time which was very excellent customer service...i mean his service was so top notch I couldn't have been any more happier *smiles*  He also was talking story to us and I loved that. I really could tell that he was very laid back and wanted to get to know us a bit and also asked if there was anything he could do for us. He also was curious if there was a special occasion as to why we were here and I mentioned that it was our first year anniversary and he smiled and congratulated us *blushes* I seriously felt that johnny just knew we were here on a special occasion and he has a really good intuition. Again, such an awesome waiter!  towards the end of our lovely meal both of us were getting a bit full and I must admit that the food at papadeux is really rich but delicious food *drools* I couldn't admit defeat yet and I went on to getting desert . I got the banana bread pudding and I was sooo full but I was determined to finish it so I wolf that sucker down. lmao. Though I was bloated and full and...just wanted to roll out instead of walking. lmao. food was really good.  In the end, my first experience went so smooth and perfect for our first anniversary that I was very very happy and I am hoping to come back again for another special occasion!  I do want to add that johnny was so lovely and helpful and he boxed up all of our left over meals. He is such an awesome waiter! If any of you guys get him, you'll be taken cared of very well!",

It's hard to save room for dessert so we ordered it to go. Definitely get the banana pudding. When you order it to go they just put the whole mason jar in the to go box and give it to you!",

    "text": "This place is a little more fancy than I expected....decor and atmosphere-wise...I thought it would be plain and simple like Red Lobster but actually the place has a very southern homey feeling to it.....although a seafood place they had like deer heads hanging and other sorts of weird decor.    Came here for dinner yesterday night with my bf and his apartment-mate...we got a table right away but even for a weekday they were still half a full house. The first thing I saw on their menu was the Crispy Alligator appetizer. ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu.   So the Oysters Duo -- comes with 3 oysters on half shell baked with a parmesan romano cheese sauce and 3 oysters on half shell topped with crabmeat, spinach and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. -- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause it's very unique to this restaurant. I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldn't have known it's alligator meat if you didn't tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat!  The Pappadeaux Platter was pretty good - everything is well  -- fried! However I like the blue crab cake the most, the mini fried crawfish (kind of like popcorn shrimp) is second best however I have to say that the fried Tilapia was a disappointment because it was sadly bland and really dry...it was the only thing I didn't like on the platter. but everything else was good. - - I even tried their watermelon lemonade and it was super refreshing!  I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any.   The service was really good, our waitress was pretty quick and friendly. Overall I enjoyed the most of the food (except the fried tilapia) and the service is good so it earned it's four stars. :)",

I understand greeting crab stuffed crab claws and lobster being pricey, but typical Cajun dishes are $10-15 over priced. Expect a $75-100 check if getting an app with dinner.",

I think my only complaint is that the service always kinda seems a little slow and the prices are a bit much.

I love the little dessert tray they have to show you what they have on the dessert menu that night. I'm a visual type of person and it's just so helpful.

The catfish was perfect, especially with a side of grits and bottle of Louisiana hot sauce.  The platters are huge and enough for two people to share. Not much in the way of non-seafood options - which made it hard for my family members that don't eat seafood to find something. That menu needs to be expanded to more than $40 steaks.    The Mediterranean Calamari appetizer is $20 and the best app on the menu - however, it's a huge plate for a large table.  I wish had a smaller option.  Only 2 people at our table would eat such a thing but no way could we tackle such a huge plate and calamari isn't something you can take home for later.   This restaurant has the best patio in the valley.  Open air, fans and misters, lots of greenery and shade.  I could spend forever on Pappadeaux's patio.   Our waiter was excellent, though the food took a long time. I think it was the stinking steak being cooked.   *So here is your take-way: Only come with seafood lovers (the rest will be uncomfortable), sit on the patio, have plenty of time to hang out, and be prepared for a high bill - but you won't be disappointed by the food or the atmosphere.",

There are a couple other restaurants popping up that are giving them a run for their money, but as for now if you want some pretty good quality seafood in Phoenix then you should definitely try this place out. Be prepared for it to always be crowded, but they do accept reservations even for small parties which is very nice. The service could definitely improve, but it's really hit or miss. We had a birthday last night at our table and the hostess said she would tell our server. Not sure who forgot but it got missed. We also sat at a small table with dirty dishes and drink cups the entire meal and even when we finished. It was a bit of a drag, but the food was good! We spent about $200 with 3 adults and 1 child. We had 2 appetizers and 4 alcoholic drinks so it can be a bit pricey. I expected way better service for the amount we spent on our meal. Minus 2 stars for the service",

Even with the amount of people in the restaurant at that time they came back often and refilled our drinks/ asked if we needed anything often and it was very appreciated.",

The place was packed. It because it's so big, the tables seemed to turn fairly quickly.   We were told it'd be an hour for a table for 2. They take your cell # and text you when your table is ready. They also have pagers available (for those of us whose cell service is extremely poor there!  Note - they had wifi for guests and we were able to get service but it was splotchy.)  We snagged seats at the very crowded bar for a drink and an app while we waited.   There must have been 7 bartenders on duty - which was awesome. The three women on our end of the bar regularly checked in with us for more drinks, etc.   (Note - drinks are good, and they have some of the NOLA staples like Hurricanes. Drinks ran about $10-11 a pop for their specialty cocktails.)   We were called to our table in less than an hour.  Our server appeared right away and explained the menu to us and made recommendations.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was hot and tasty.  We held back a bit so we could save room for dessert, which also did not disappoint.  They have a lot of options for your sweet tooth.    Will definitely return as there were numerous menu items we did not get to try.    Here's what we did have:    Voodoos and Swamp Things (drinks); Lump crab and spinach dip; filet (w/green beans and potatoes); stuffed jumbo shrimp; baked mac n cheese with crab; and NY cheesecake with strawberry.",

The drive getting over was not great but I was so looking forward to my dinner with my family. My husband ordered a beer and it was not served so he asked the waitress about it and it was eventually brought over. He had a metal butter dish on his coaster and she flicked it a crossed the table to make room for his beer. My mother asked for hot tea and the waitress told her you going to have to give me a minute to get that. My husband and I wanted to order the Redfish and the Mahi and they were out of both. Our reservation was 6 pm how can you run out? My sister who is gluten free asked for her scallops to be cooked well done were not cooked on both sides only one side. It was such a bad experience we will not be back. So sad because I use to love this place but between the food quality and the service it is off our list!",

The crawfish boil was good as well. Seasoning was not over powering and 2.5 pounds were more than enough for my table of 3 to share. Only minor complaint I have was that the crawfish may have been overcooked as the meet wasn't so easy to get out of the shell. Either that or they weren't fresh.   Everything else was good. Service was a little bit slow but to be expected on a Friday night when every table in the house is occupied.",

Their interpretation is incorrect! I will not be coming back here again. And I suggest if you're 21 don't even bother ordering a drink here. After reading this law, I am interpreting that this law ONLY applies to Arizona residents. I am NOT a Arizona resident! The staff would not serve me even though I was legally able to drink. I am 21 years old! The law saids:   Acceptable forms of ID include an unexpired driver license or identification cards (vertical or horizontal) issued by:  - Any state OTHER THAN ARIZONA, - The District Of Columbia, - Any Territory Of The United States or Canada if the license includes: - a picture of the licensee and - the person's date of birth.  A liquor-licensed business may not accept as the only form of identification an unexpired, vertical (under age 21) ARIZONA driver license or identification card when the owner/presenter has been age 21 for more than 30 days. This applies only to Arizona driver licenses and identification cards.  If you are age 21 or older and have been denied entry into a bar or denied the sale or service of alcohol and would like to replace a vertical ARIZONA driver license, you will find complete instructions by visiting this link to the Arizona Department of Transportation website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fazdot.gov%2Fmvd%2Fdriver-services%2Fdriver-license-information%2Fduplicate-or-renew-your-license&s=6d80170858137bfd5a270a7f802d2724c87c9c26f6920d6bf65f6dbc7fa9b269\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azdot.gov/mvd/driver-ser...</a>.",

Anyhow, I was able to try new foods, like: alligator and frog legs! Alligator was breaded and fried, while the server recommended we get the frog legs seared because they come with better flavoring that way. The sauce was delicious, but I wouldn't order them again. I'd definitely have the alligator again. I ordered the Pasta Mardi Gras for dinner. So good! A huge portion, of course.  Our server, brought out a dessert platter and had my mom choose one, on the house!

    "text": "I was in Phoenix for the annual Origami Owl convention.  Pappadeaux is where my team leader chose to have our team dinner. I loved this choice because of the extensive options on the menu. There was so much to choose from that I didn't know where to start!   I studied the menu the best way I knew how while hungry . I chose a cup of Louisiana  Shrimp Gumbo to start. It wasn't salty like most places it had the right amount of spice to clear your throat. There was also a generous amount of seafood for the size.  I chose the Mississippi Catfish Opelousas for my main dish  after much debate  going on in my head. I usually like my catfish fried but I thought this would be healthier even though it would be sitting on Lemon Garlic Butter sauce. I really can't say, \" No\" to things with lemon garlic butter. I had an issue with eating oysters that night so they simply left them out and added more Shrimp and jumbo crab meat. It was absolutely divine with the dirty rice ! Loved it!!   I was stuffed but I couldn't turn my back on the Banana Wafer pudding that was served in a cute mason jar! The pudding was nice and thick and not too sweet. It was perfect! I also shared my husband's drink Swamp Thing but it was too strong for me.   I wish we had one of these restaurants in Las Vegas!",

I asked for the salmon to be medium rare, came medium well.  The shrimp were overcooked.  The scallops, came perfectly, medium rare!  Overall I thought all the food was very bland and did not have a fresh taste.  Seemed like I was eating at a cafeteria.  Kind of reminded me of the New Orleans section at Disneyland...crowded, not much flavor.  We wished we went somewhere else when we were done.  It was someone's birthday, and we did skip the free desert they were offering.  There is plenty of food.  The plates are huge and when the food arrives, it does look small, but really, it is huge.  So you do get well fed.  Parking is great.  Their patio looks great!  The staff was very friendly.  Service was average.",

She was quick, knew the menu inside and out and is a True asset to this establishment.   Apps and drinks were served promptly and dinner was amazing. Caribbean lobster was huge and cooked perfectly. The ettouffe  was to die for.. .. Just as if we were back in New Orleans.. Great flash back and desserts topped off the meal. Love-love-love this place.",

This time I tried the Atlantic Salmon Alexander prepared medium rare with shrimp, scallops and crawfish in a slightly spicy cream sauce. It was cooked perfectly with a portion that was big enough to feed 2. No matter what location I go to this place is always busy and has at least a 20 minute wait even longer on the weekends. The owners of these joints originally started in the steakhouse business in Texas so that is what I want to try next time. My servers name was Nick L and he went above and beyond to make my dining experience pleasurable.",

    "text": "Last night, my wife and I wanted to treat my parents to a celebratory dinner at our favorite restaurant. Little did I know, we were going to have a terrible experience. We were being seated by the hostess and walked past over 2 dozen empty tables in the middle of the restaurant to be seated in a walk way. We politely  told her we did not want to be seated in in a walk way and was going to have us sit rightg next to the bathroom door. We didn't want that either for obvious reasons. I asked her why we couldn't sit at 1 of the dozens of open tables in the middle and she ignored me. We finally sat down to the hostess' next spot which was one table over from the bathroom table. My family and I just wanted to sir down at this point. Everything was fine up until the point of the appetizer came (I won't even go into how the Mediterranean calamari got taken off the menu). Then we notice a HUGE group of 35-40 people come in and sit at the table right behind ours. Since that time, the group was so loud that a baby a table next to them started crying. To try and talk to my parents across the table, I had to yell. Not to mention the people of the large party bumping into my wife and I along with countinously going between our table to get to there's all while we are trying to eat and try to enjoy the celebratory occasion. This nonsense went on for an hour. Towards the end, our waiter got pulled to help the large group while we sat for over 15 min to get the check, then another 15 to receive payment for the check. As we walked out I told this all to the manager and she looked and sounded as if she could care less because we already played out Bill and are leaving. I don't blame this on our waiter or the very large party, I blame this mostly on the manager for not putting the party in the banquet room and for allowing other customers to be seated next to the large party. She knew that a very large party was coming in and showed large lack of respect and concern for other people who wanted to enjoy tgeir time there. Also, some of the blame needs to bed put on the hostess for not sitting us where there were dozens of open table( most of which were not sat at all night). At this point, I don't think I'll be going back for a VERY long time. WOSRT experience there by far.",

Table mate had the shrimp and orecchiette with vodka sauce- pasta over cooked, shrimp rubbery, vodka sauce very nice. Asked three times for tableware, water brought one glass at a time, couldn't find a spoon for my coffee, drink refills had to be requested.

But glad I visit PHX for work often enough and this is my go-to for lunch. 5 stars for the exceptional service our server Mia provided. She was attentive, friendly, on top of our refills and such a natural! She also provided great recommendations that we actually chose and was glad that we did. My colleague and I left as happy campers (as usual)!",

The reason I give it four stars is just that it is very pricey but it is sort of a fine dining place. I would definitely eat here again from time to time.",

You may choose something other as an entree, but please do yourself a favor and order the Lobster Bisque, which isn't only brisk bisque but also generous with lobster bites.

Our son had the Fried Shrimp plate (long story short: Josh had a mixup and thought he had orderd from the kids menu, so his platter was a bit smaller compared to his teammates dining at the same table. Josh was so cool, he brought out more than a handful more fried shrimp!! ). Our daughter had the hot dog bites w fries, came w fruit & lemonade from the kids menu, and I had the very delicious Mixed Grilled Seafood Skewer platter (came with Salmon, Scallops & Shrimp w Dirty Rice, and Grilled Veggies). Wifey and I also shared a bowl of their equally delicious Seafood Gumbo. Would definitely come back again!  The Prodigy Hoops Fam",

However after that wait, we were seated and quickly assisted by a kind waitress, who's name is passing me right now. She was a great waitress given she was attentive but not overbearing.   My girlfriend and I ordered the Gulf Coast Oysters as a starter and we're pleased with them. They came with horseradish, lemon, and a soy sauce garlic type of sauce. After scarfing those down, I ordered a bowl of Scrimp Gumbo and my girlfriend order mussels. The gumbo was good, but the broth had an abnormal flavor that I wasn't accustomed to. The mussels; however, were excellent. They were in a white-wine garlic sauce that was topped with parsley and lemon. For dessert we thoroughly enjoyed and shared a glazed creme brulee with berries, that was also excellent. Through and through, with an exception of the gumbo, the food was 5-Star.   Shortly, the atmosphere was similar to an average creole restaurant. Given the Cubs were playing the Indians, the bar was packed and quite loud. The fun laughed and formally dresser servers makes for a romantic atmosphere.   With all of this being said, Pappadeaux is a great place to eat at for creole and seafood.   4.35 Stars.",

We also ordered the fried calamari with artichoke hearts, and that too was very tasty. The restaurant was pretty packed/busy for a weeknight but our main entree did not take long. It came at the perfect time after finishing the last bit of our appetizer. I had ordered the Moroccan salmon and shrimp. It was served with couscous, it had the perfect bite to it! Salmon was grilled to perfection, very soft, buttery and moist. Shrimp came with a lump of crab which I did not expect but so good! So much flavor in a dish",

After making my initial review I was contacted by Guest Relations and was offered the opportunity to return to give it a second try.  The General Manager stepped in and that was honorable of Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen to right a wrong and offer an apology for the service that was provided.  I was also given a gift card as a token of respect as a customer (the amount doesn't matter) and I will choose to give it another chance, which is why I have given them another star for the effort.  The food has always been decent when I've visited on other occasions, so let's hope that I can add some more stars the next time I visit.",

I ordered creme brulee which was out of the world. Overall, I give 5 stars and highly recommend this place for finger licking sea food.",

    "text": "This was my boyfriend and I'd first time coming here. We ordered a dozen cold gulf shucked oysters, fried alligator, shrimp creole and grits, and Atlantic salmon Alexander. The oysters were great, the shells were pretty dirty on the outside that my bf's napkin had so many black smudges on it but I mean you don't put the shell in your mouth so I didn't mind as much as he did. The fried alligator was so tasty and the sauce it came with was awesome and zingy! It also came with these shoestring like fried potato thingys. I ordered the shrimp creole and grits and a baked potato on the side. I have never had grits before but MAN, were those so good!!! And so was the shrimp creole, it had okra, green bell beepers, and I think tomato chunks. My bf ordered the Atlantic salmon Alexander with dirty rice and he said it was the best salmon he's ever had. It was topped with grilled shrimp and scallops and the flavors were perfection. Biggest baked potato I've ever had btw.   For dessert we ordered the double turtle brownie topped with Haagen Daaz ice cream and Caramel sauce. Since it was our first time they comped the dessert which was so nice of them!  Only reason I gave 4/5 stars was for less than perfect service time management.  We got seated, 10 min later he came and asked what drinks we wanted and we ordered apps. 15 min later our waters came. Another 15-20 min our drinks and bread came out. Then another 15-20 min he came and took our orders. The food didn't take too long to come out but when we would look for him to order things it felt like he was no where to be found. We were there for 2 and a half hours and even though we weren't in a rush it felt like a long time.  Benefit of the doubt, they are a big restaurant with an always packed Saturday night. So if you go on a Saturday night, just be prepared to enjoy some quality time with whoever you go with.",

This was my first time coming here.  Also there was a piece of lobster shell in my bisque as well as a hair in my water. I didn't complain to the manager but I should have. Never again. Steer clear of Carla who is an older woman  with glasses and bad attitude. Not to mention it was our Anniversary!!!!",

We asked for a table for 6 and they told us it was an hour and a half wait (actually ended up being 1 and 15 min) but we decided to stay coz it was worth the wait! They have a garden patio waiting area whichbwas very pretty and lush green on a nice spring night! If I wasn't starving that wait wouldn't have been bad with company... And there's always the bar while you are waiting (21+ only tho ) got me a pina colada! Yummmyyy tasted coconuty and creamy.  We got the apetizer trio to share but substituted calamari for the salmon. The other two were the fried alligator and shrimp/crawfish fondeux. Fried alligator was interesting but good...didn't like the sauce coz it was too salty. The fondeux was good but I still prefer peeling my own crawfish than it already mixed in a sauce(its part of the fun). And the calamari was breaded and crispy yummy!  I decided to order crispy atlantic salmon with maine lobster. The waitress told me that the lobster was only abiut 2 ounces (I guess I don't know what that estimate is because when my plate came out and I saw three tiny pieces of lobster) still considering... My plate was delicious even if was the most expensive plate on the table for 33 bucks and also the smallest portion. The salmon was a good size and yummy, also came with crispy shrimp that was seasoned very well and the tiny pieces of lobster with the side of roasted acorn squash (never had this before and it is freaking delicious and buttery). Everything was delicious and worth the wait!  We got a free dessert and another one for the table to share: brownie and key lime pie...eh... But they sure were pretty!  Our server was great! Her name was Lena :) love the ambience and I think there was live music earlier but i didn't know where it was coming from. It was a great time! Can't wait to go back here!!",

    "text": "I had dined at Pappadeaux years ago, but this was the first time for my wife. Although the restaurant was busy, they were able to seat us right away. We were warmly greeted by our server Jenny who shared with us the cajun influence on the food the restaurant serves. Additionally, she was sure to explain that all offerings were made from scratch in the kitchen- meaning that any dish could be customized to suit anyone's taste. My wife ordered a Crescent City Sangria, which she found to be flavorful and refreshing. I ordered an Old Fashioned which was True to the classic cocktail but nothing special. For dinner, my wife ordered the Grilled Tilapia and Jumbo Shrimp which was served over a tomato, hazelnut and green bean salad and topped with crab meat in a lemon butter sauce. I'll admit that I stole a few bites from my wife's plate- it was perfectly cooked and bursting with citrus flavor. I had the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette which consisted of 6 jumbo shrimp stuffed with jalapeno and Monterey Jack cheese, wrapped in bacon, char-grilled to perfection, and served over dirty rice. The medley of flavors in this dish were savory and spicy. And while we didn't have room for desert, who could pass up a free desert offering from our tentative waitress, Jenny? So we indulged in the Pecan Truffle Brownie and it was excellent- moist brownie, loaded with pecans, and served a la mode with vanilla ice cream. Our meal was delicious and reasonably priced for a seafood establishment. Altogether, with drinks and entrees, our total was $85. We will be back!",

Searching for a place to eat on Saturday afternoon, we found Pappadeaux Seafood on Yelp with a good rating and very close to our hotel.  We love good Cajun cuisine, so we took a chance and had an early dinner there.  In a nutshell, the food was excellent and the service was outstanding.  Very surprised at how fresh the seafood was given the time of day and the fact that the restaurant is in a land-locked area.  Live Maine lobster of quality sizes were in a tank at the front of the restaurant.   We ordered pasta dishes with seafood such as crawfish and shrimp, and andouille sausage.  Marinara cream sauce was awesome.  And our daughter got stuffed crab that was delish.  We shared a cheesecake for dessert that was gone in no time.; it was our first time at a Pappadeaux's restaurant so dessert was on them.  And at the end, our bill was under $80.  Great food, great service, and all at a great price.  Highly recommend this restaurant if you are ever in North Phoenix.  Go early!  The joint fills up fast especially during dinner time.",

Phoenix always seems to be the step-child in terms of cuisine when it comes to dining in the southwest compared to California.  So it's quite nice that we have Pappadeaux locally to enjoy some southern food.  We first came to Pappadeaux 10 years ago for fresh gulf oysters, when a friend introduced Pappadeaux to us.  We keep going back for the live crawfish during the spring.  The prices have gone up since we first found this place 10 years ago, but it's so worth it for the best live crawfish in the west coast.  We come here for special events, like birthdays, celebrations, etc.  The ambiance is fantastic, the service is great, and the food is delicious.  The prices are on the higher side so expect to shell out more, but it's worth the cost for special occasions and live crawfish!  This place gets busy during Spring training, nice winter months, and weekends, so make a reservation or you may be waiting for a while for seating.  The only negative is we now have to wait until next spring for the crawfish again, that is a long wait!!",

At first glance the place is very nice and adorable; items on the menu seem to be pretty pricey; but after you get your food... boy is it the most delicious food I've had in a long time! Also our waitress was amazing, available and not pushy. The Swamp Thing drink was super strong as it had 3 different alcohol drinks in one. I would definitely come back again when I'm in Arizona.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon Alexander and Andouille Sausage Gumbo and my friend ordered the Grilled Tilapia and Jumbo Shrimp and caesar salad. The portion size was a good size and the food was delicious that it made it totally worth the price. I really enjoyed my experience at Papadeux starting from the host and all the way to the end. I wish I could have ordered appetizers and dessert, however the waitress was right as what I ordered was plenty of food that I had to take half my food home. Next time I'll bring friends so that I can order more food and share the experience.",

From the moment we walked in we had great service from the hostess to our waiter Sam. The manager even came by when she heard it was our first time there. Sam is a great server, very attentive to our requests , very helpful in describing the different dishes they serve & believe me they have a very big list of things to choose from. he food was delicious and plentiful. We tried the gator tail , which i've eaten before in other places. It was so good. The raw oysters are superb and I decided to have fried oysters. I grew up in Fl and grew up eating them so I was hoping they'd be good. They were ! My husband got the crawfish etouffee which he loved. the manager even had us pick out a dessert to take home, on the house. We were way too full to have it there. The dishes are more than enough , you won't go home hungry. The atmosphere is great, very nice looking place. We most definitely will be adding this place as a favorite to eat.",

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK. IT'S ALWAYS SUPER BUSY. if it's an especially busy nite like a friday or saturday, they will give you a pager. sometimes the wait is over 1 hour. alot of those people go to fridays directly next door for cheaper drinks then go back to pappadeaux when it's gets closer to getting a table.",

This place is great, the ambiance, the food ,the people, a cornucopia of what was to come. We started with oysters on the half shell, fresh,briny, and sooo cold I got brain freeze. I've had frog legs from Alabama to Zanesville and these were far by the best ever fall off bone croaking delicious flippers I ever had. My 1 1/2 lb. fresh Maine lobster was so sweet I did not even think twice about using the clarified butter. The claws were as big as a baseball mitt. Oh, by the way I did have the wedge lettuce with blue cheese and bacon dressing and again it was the best. The rest of our party had food fit for a king and remarked on every aspect of our dining pleasure.When ever I get a hankering for the Big Easy again this fine establishment will beckon my name, and it will be soon.",

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far!  Pappadeaux makes awesome cajun food. Cajun is one of my favorite styles of food because it is a way of getting food that is spicy and/or seafood and/or covered in butter.  My favorite dish is the mediterranean calamari.  This calamari is fried with artichokes, then topped with feta, capers and tomatoes.  Finally, it is drizzled in butter.  There is clearly a greek influence in this dish, which is another one of my favorite types of cuisine.    I have frequented this place enough to fall in love with several other appetizers as well: the lump crab and spinach dip, the shrimp and crawfish fondeaux, the jumbo lump crab cakes and the lobster bisque are all delicious!    For an entree I would recommend the soft shell crab or the lobster tail.  If these are out of your price range, just get a bunch of appetizers and save room for dessert!  The seafood here is the freshest that one can hope for in Arizona, so I personally think it is worth splurging a little.    Their cocktails are great!  If you get any of the blended ones, be careful!  They are so tasty, you may not notice how strong they are!  I like the frozen margarita and the swamp thing.  Last, but certainly not least, you will undoubtedly be tempted by the deserts here.   This is not only because they have a dessert tray but because they are southern comfort classics.  I am addicted to the banana bread pudding, the key lime pie and all of the different styles of cheesecakes.  They have a few staple items which are always on the tray and they have seasonal selections as well.  I love the atmosphere here.  It has dim, romantic lighting.  It can get loud at times especially when they have live cajun music.    The service is great here, most of the time.  Once or twice it has been a bit slow, but because of how great the food is, I will always come back for more!",

They had an amazing menu, I decided to have some of their crispy fried alligator which was so much better than I thought it would be. I mean alligators don't exactly look tasty, but the restaurant really did an excellent job in cooking it.   It was absolutely delicious and it is now something I will be completely willing to try again instead of having to be talked into it. The service in the restaurant was alright, the waiters were friendly enough but they weren't that attentive so I did have to wait when making an order. After actually having ordered my food though, it did come out pretty fast. It took about 15 minutes and everything I got was delicious.   The food was a little overpriced in my opinion but overall it was a decent restaurant.",

I was in Houston for business & thought how lucky to be getting a Po Boy from Pappadeaux's.  I did not read the menu as I knew ahead of time what I was going to get, but to my surprise it was different.  Instead of Remoulade Sauce, it now comes with Tartar & Cocktail sauce and pickle slices??? Not so good anymore...planning a trip to Phx in August, want Po-Boys...but not with the new recipe.",

They had music going and the atmosphere was amazing.   We were seated before the rush kicked in. Our waiter was SO nice! We told him we had never been there and he was very attentive and helpful. He suggested we try to fried alligator for an appetizer, we both hesitated because we had never had alligator. But it was a go big or go home type of night so we decided to try it! Oddly enough we both LOVED It!   My boyfriend had a fish dish and I had lobster with shrimp dish. I had never ate lobster and did not like it, but that's just my own review of the lobster NOT of the restaurant. We will definitely be going back!  The only downside to it is the price, although for both of us our bill was about $120.00, we will definitely be going back. Next time we may not order as much food though.",

    "text": "Contrary to the sign in front, this restaurant serves the worst seafood in the Phx valley.  I took some family members to dinner hear on a sunday evening and the experience was a total fail from the beginning.  Despite a plethora of open tables, we were told we would need to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated.  I think this may have been because we were a mixed race family. Predictably, when we were seated we were given a poorly situated table at the back of the bus.  We demanded and were reluctantly given another nearby table.  That should have been a sign to leave, but we stayed to endure a truly terrible and overpriced meal.  We ordered an appetizer platter to share, and then entrees of stuffed fried crab, stuffed fried shrimp, cajun catfish, and a cesar salad.  The only good thing in the entire meal was the salmon on the appetizer plate.  All the other seafood items were over-salted to the point of being almost inedible.  Two family members complained of feeling uncomfortably bloated after dinner due to the salinity of the food.  YUCKERS!!!  The service hear is also atrocious.  Despite the fact that this is a fairly expensive restaurant, it is completely staffed by inexperienced high school and college students. They even attempted to overcharge us for one of our entrees.  I left a 10% tip, which was in retrospect was way too much. No return trip ever!",

Today I went for lunch and got the Crispy Halibut sanwich and fries. They gave me shoestring fries, if you get fries make sure you get the regular fries cause shoe string fries look cute but they are just annoying. The sandwich was so good, and it was a big piece of halibut for $12.95. My girlfriend got the wood fired talapia with greenbeans, shrimp, and veggy. It was so good and the lunch price $13.95. She usually gets the crab legs and like i said, so many good things i get something different everytime. Nice big bar with a few boths and the dinning area is huge.

    "text": "Pappadeaux and I have a history.  We're both from Houston.  At home, I've been to just about every Pappas restaurant there is many times.  The Pappas family is an integral part of the Houston restaurant scene, love them or hate them.  (Most people love them.)  And in good old H-Town, they have a longstanding informal rivalry with the Goode family, who are like the working man's Pappas family, maintaining similar but less pricey/fancy restaurants.  At home, given a choice between Pappadeaux and Goode Co. Seafood, I will always choose Goode Co., because that's how my family rolls.  But when you take Pappadeaux out of that context, you must acknowledge that it is really a great restaurant.  This place is a carbon copy of the original, down to the plants on the patio.  I'm fine with that.  Why fix it if it ain't broke?  As far as I can tell, the food is carbon copy too.  And I'm fine with that, too!  It's pretty darn good food, and it's an accurate representation of the kind of food that our part of the world loves best.  You've got your Cajun, you've got your Creole.  You've got your fried fish (yummmm) and you've got your grilled fish (yummm!!!).  Their po-boy is not too terrible at all, considering how removed it is from its original context!  As a matter of fact, it was downright tasty!  I much prefer flounder to catfish, but hey, I'll live. The original down-home dishes are what Pappadeaux does best, and I am always weirded out to see it advertising itself as some kind of fusion restaurant or lobster buffet.  Sushi?  Seriously?  Come on guys!  You don't need a gimmick!  This isn't a Landry's!  If I had to pick favorite dishes, I'd go with anything mesquite grilled, their fried shrimp, and their crawfish bisque, just because I love bisque (although Pappadeaux does not, I should add, have the best in the world).  The service is always good, although I miss the witty signage that all Pappadeuxs have in Houston.  AH WELL.  I enjoy their atmosphere because it is like so many other seafood restaurants on the Gulf Coast, where I half-expect to see a picture of my grandfather's boat on the wall.    I haven't had much of what Phoenix has to offer in the seafood department, but I'm willing to bet, based purely on my Houstonian hubris, that this Texas import is one of the best in town.  Now if only we could get Goode Co. out here...",

Trying to ensure no annoyances with waiting, I made sure to call early in the afternoon to ask for a 6:00 pm reservation.  They don't take reservations during that time ... okay, that's fine, I understand BUT they will accept call-aheads and they will make sure your name is already on the waiting list before you get there.  Woo! that works! I call at 5:30 pm and let them know we will be half an hour.  Due to the fact they did not have a wait at that time, they would not take my name or party information.  When we got there at 6 pm, they had a wait.  I was decently annoyed but since it was only a 15-20 minute wait for our table, I wasn't overly annoyed.  We got our table, our server, and placed our order.  Sadly, there were multiple tables around us in and out before we even got our entrees.  There were several tables that ended up having three parties in and out before we were finally done.  That was a pretty big annoyance to say the least, especially since we were pretty hungry and we saw other tables getting served at a much more rapid pace!!!  The place does extremely well because the food is absolutely AMAZING.  The seafood gets flown in daily and not too many seafood places in Arizona can say the same thing.  Despite the waits we had to have to get seated and to finally get our food and then the wait for dessert, I still managed to embarass myself with the amount of amazing tasting food I devoured",

    "text": "First off, the don'ts: Don't bother going to this joint on the nights they do they oyster/crawfish specials (I think it's Wednesday and Thursday), it's packed far past the point of unpleasantness. It's just no fun, it ruins the experience, period. I mean, you know, unless you love oysters more than butterflies and rainbows and sex, in which case, knock yourself out I guess. I'd rather drive to the nearest ocean, pluck oysters out of it myself, take them home, spend a month learning how to prepare them properly and then make and serve them to myself than go to this stupid place when it's packed. Also, don't order the gumbo. It was awful.  That's really all I have bad to say about the food I have had at Pappadeaux. Everything else has been just wonderful. I had the whitefish dinner with lemon butter and capers, my wife had the shrimp and lobster platter (I can't remember their fancy Cajun names). We shared the appetizer plate that had calamari and alligator tail meat, among other things - all of it was truly stupidly delicious. Their calamari preparation (and sauce) is the best I've had in my life, and that's saying something.  So why the three stars, you might be asking, instead of four? Well frankly, it's just too expensive. It's obvious they've got hella overhead, the place is truly beautifully decorated, but you know what? I don't like paying for overhead, and there, I said it. I like paying for air conditioning and good food. I don't care if you've got one of every species of edible fish mounted to your beautifully laquered ornate wood trim or not, I really don't. If there are two of you and you are having a couple of drinks, it's difficult to walk out of this place for less than a benjamin and I frankly just think that's too much. We're not being served gold leafed fois gras and caviar here. This is especially so considering the portion sizes, which are not as criminal as Fish Market used to be, but are still not exactly a feast. In addition, the waitstaff is sub-par. I've said it before and I'll say it again, when I'm laying down this kind of jack, I don't expect to have to flag my waiter down like it's the last lap at Nascar. All that having been said, if you're craving good seafood and have the money and patience and can get a seat without waiting for an hour, Pappadeax is about as good as it gets in Phoenix.",

When a party calls with a reservation and you confirm said reservation they should not be told to either sit outside or wait for an additional thirty minutes before being seated.

Some meals were not even brought out until after other party members had already fisnished.  Trying to flag down a waiter for a refill on a water was nearly impossiable.  I realize that it is not the wait staff's fault but rather poor management.  In the future I will stick to a less pricey better tasting cajun option.",

I don't mind this so much as i hate watching a stand-in hostess stuff her face with crackers while we wait 20 minutes (which turned in to longer, of course while people that got there after us went in before we did...) We get to our table and get the most lethargic and unresponsive waitress we could possibly get. Great we get our order in with no feedback or questions on how we want anything cooked or substitutes on sides or how we want our potatoes... absolutely unacceptable. Get our drinks and my SO's drink cup has a layer of grease film on the top of his Extremely watered down coke... yummy. Menus left on the table, extra silver on the table. Our waitress didn't even clear anything off and just let it all pile up. We ordered calamari and get this microwaved, freeze burn crap that tasted like rubber on some pieces and gushy  on others... gross. Look at the extra plate left on the other side of our already cluttered table and it had food flecks on it.... Absolutely disgusting. Will NEVER go back there again. bad bad bad.",

    "text": "We walked in and were completely impressed by the ambiance and the overall look of the entire place.  We stared with the shrimp cocktail - which had Fresh gulf shrimp, chunky avocados & pico de gallo in a spicy cocktail sauce.  I can say, this was the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had.  We also split a ceasar salad which was perfect.  For dinner, I had the Mahi blackened over dirty rice .  The fish was fresh and spicy - all their fish is flown in daily.  My date had the Pasta Mardi Gra - Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. . .  This dish was quite spectacular... We thought we were in New Orleans...  For desert, we had NY Cheesecake - with fresh strawberries in a sauce - topped with fresh whipped cream - I can't think of any cheese cake I have ever had that was better than this...  The desert plate they bring to the table has all the deserts on there - they all looked amazing- quite a difficult choice... WOW - the entire dinner was perfect!  AND on top of it all, our service was top notch.  SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on, cleaned the table in between courses, and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full.  And he had a great attitude - he acted like he wanted to make our dinner very special.  The manager came and talked with us also, and thanked us for coming in.  Quite impressive.  This was one of the most memorable dinners we have had, from the time we walked in the door until we walked out.  We were completely impressed with Pappadeaux - and can't wait until we return.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would, it is worth it.",

    "text": "My first visit to Pappadeaux didn't start off well. I decided to grab a quick dinner to avoid rush hour traffic back from Phoenix to Chandler, and Pappadeaux looked good. I waited almost 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge me, in spite of a half dozen servers standing nearby talking about their various life dramas. (It was 115 degrees that day, and ice water was definitel at the top of my list of \"must haves,\" seconded by a glass of wine.)   As I started to leave, determined to find a restaurant that actually welcomed its customers, an astute server -- Johnnie -- realized I was ready to bail and proceeded to treat me like a queen for the next 45 minutes.   I was sitting next to the dessert tray and he said, since I'd waited to be served, the restaurant would treat me to a dessert. I don't eat dessert, but I tried to be gracious in light of his offer, so I said thank you. Johnnie realized it wasn't going to be my thing. I ordered the filet topped with crabmeat and a wonderful sauce. It was perfectly cooked according to my request, and certainly didn't need anything extra to enhance its flavor. Johnnie talked to his manager and, after his talk, I was comp'd my meal (less my two glasses of excellent wine). I told his manager that Johnnie had saved the day. The manager said the person who was working my area of the restaurant hadn't shown up for work that day. I didn't really appreciate the excuse. A half dozen servers were within 8 feet of me and could have seen I wasn't been served. But Johnnie did -- and took responsibility. Good for him!  The food was excellent. (I'm not a big seafood eater, but the sauce for the steak accompanied by the crab was perfectly seasoned.) Johnny earned a handsome tip because of his attentiveness, and the restaurant earned a second chance in the future.  But I think I'll ask for Johnny as my server.  Cheryl",

I love the ambiance of this place as it truly feels like I'm back again in NOLA. I don't even mind waiting 30 or so minutes to be seated while live blues music serenades me in preparation for those addictive flavors to come. The sights, the smells, the sounds, the service and most importantly the flavors, Papadeaux consistently delivers the entire package. I most certainly will return again and again!",

We decided to stay at the intimate, quiet bar. Our app, the trio, took awhile, but was so worth it! We replaced the calamari, which they were out of, with more alligator. The app was great! I loved the fondeaux, but my hubby thought the alligator, which was usually moist, was king of dry. We ordered the horseradish plank tilapia and the porchartrain. The tilapia was a bit dry, without sauce. I loved my fish, but I feel like there wasn't enough sauce. The service at the bar was awesome. We will definitely return, but maybe try new entrees. The potions are huge, so we will have a great lunch.",

When they came they  were drowned in a sauce with little on them and way too much rice.  Had the fried clams for dinner.  Tough and overly chewy and for a full order not really very many.

We started with the Boudin, which is a spicy Cajun sausage which was cooked to perfection. It's served with dirty rice. Very simple dish but very tasteful. Our server was really nice, her name was Jackie, attentive and definitely making sure we had everything we needed. Another thing that we really appreciated was that my cousin has a dairy allergy, after we told Jackie about it the manager came out to our table and clarified everything with my cousin to make sure it would be cooked correctly. Downsides were that we did notice that it looks like a lot of the staff seems to be over worked. They don't have enough servers or something. Our table wasn't set when we sat down, no silverware or napkins. Overall my experience was fairly good. But for a dinner for 4 costing over $200 dollars I expect a little more than just good.",

Typically the wait can be LONG but catching them on Sunday afternoon for lunch was perfect.  Just me and the kid and I sold the idea of this place over a fast food chain after being in the car for a while. As expected, no real wait. We were seated immediately but after the initial table, I made a request to move us to the bar area with a booth and a view of the AFC Championship Football game. Worked out perfectly!!!   Needing a drink, I went with the Strawberry Mangearux Tango drink, a Kids Fried Shrimp & fries meal, and a Louisiana Gumbo & Po boy combo. I wasn't sure what to expect with the PoBoy but figured if it wasn't enough shrimp I'll just steal from the kid. That wasn't the case for lunch. Po Boy sandwich had plenty of shrimp (maybe just 1 sliced pickle too much, but easy to remove) and good complimentary ingredients. Bread used wasn't the same as the baguette type brought out with butter prior to the meal but same taste. Instead of Fries with the Po Boy, that's where the Gumbo came into play. A few choices, but when I heard Andouille sausage everything was a blur. With family roots tied to the south and one of the family's specialized \"go to meal\" of gumbo, It's always hard for me not to be critical of any others. This one was cool... A little too much juice, but decent flavor. I like mine a bit thicker so some Gumbo Filet may have helped resolve.   Good options for lunch and the timing from order to table wasn't so bad with the football game playing & kids menu games going on. Next time I plan to give the oysters and fish a go as many of the fish plates leaving the kitchen were looking good...",

Besides that.........the best part of the meal for me would have to be the appetizers. The Blue Coin Oysters were my favorite, they were fresh like they were just pulled from the ocean. The fried alligator was delicious. I was not impressed by the main course which was the Catfish and oysters w/ dirty rice. The fish was pretty bland didn't have much a flavor to it. Next time I'll come just for the appetizers, and make sure there's no left overs lol.",

We left there full as a tick & we could barely even finish our entrees since their portions were quite generous. We started with the oyster & chilled shrimp app as you'd guess, my hubby chose to start with the blue points & OMG is all I can say!! He was completely in love with the oysters & the shrimp were a definite hit also, very good value for the buck!! I then had to try a cup of the crawfish bisque, all I can say is there's really nothing to say except it was creaminess heaven!! Then yes the hubby needed just a few more oysters so he wanted to compare the gulf coast & he could of course tell the difference with their saltiness compared to the blue points sweetness but he said either way they were both sheer bliss!! Then we've got the entrees but at this point who really has room, lol!! My hubby chose the half of grilled chicken because he needs more white meat in his life, haha & he was so glad he did! He had the chicken with the brocolini & red skin mashed potatoes, he said everything was so moist & fresh! I had the grilled seafood skewers with the chilled barley salad with fresh arugula, okay everything was soooooo good & the portions were huge!! I literally could only eat half of one of the skewers & the barley salad was so good you almost forgot that it was healthy!! Can't wait to bring my southern mother in law their when she comes out to visit us because she'll absolutely love it. This will definitely a hit & will be one of our regular spots, you definitely get a great value for your money!!",

Total we waited 35 minutes from when we placed our order to get our food and the worse is that our plates were cold --'. My husband and I are two bites and decided to take it home. Another 20 Minutes to get the check and boxes. Too expensive for the service we got! Bad experience!   Update  After my review the manager nicely mailed me a gift card to try again. This time the service was perfect, Brooke was really nice, effective, and quick! The food amazing as usual!! I am giving a 5 stars BUT the tables are really too close to each other :/!",

We got ready to leave the waiter Eddie offered us the desert off of the try. We were full and decided to get the banana pudding. Eddie swore by it saying it was made fresh everyday. Well here is this mess that they call freshly made the bananas were spoiled in the jar the cookies were extra mushy and the pudding was gritty. We drove from the Radisson on 44th by the airport which in traffic took us almost 40 minutes. We were so disappointed if they were close We would of drove back. Don't order desert.

    "text": "Pappadeaux's a bit difficult to get to but you would expect it to be difficult to find Cajun food this far west.  Really popular place for the weekend crowd but if you call about 15 minutes before arriving they will put you on the wait list so that's nice.  Decor is pretty good but the dining room is so big it sort of feels like a factory, maximize the number of times the tables can be filled and flipped.  Well, that's enough about that...bar was kind of disappointing especially since they do not carry any southern beers, no Abita no Dixie.  I was actually surprised about the beer selection being so sparse, if I remember correctly 8 choices, nothing really a standout.  The food....it was ok.  She had the steak...a rib eye if I remember correctly, it was not a 37$ steak by any means.  Presentation was not great at all  meat looked lumpy and misshapen.  I had the crawfish etouffee and fried crawfish.  It was ok...really nothing special.  Etouffee was by far much better than the fried but I did not walk away waiting to come back again.  For a starter I had a dozen raw oysters on the half shell.  They were the highlight of the night by far.  Nothing else really wowed either of us.    Bottom line:  if you're craving some Cajun this is the place to go in the phoenix area, but you will probably not leave feeling like you just had a memorable experience.",

Everything on menu looked good so we ended up ordering the appetizer trio, seared ahi tuna, and some alligator meat.  The ahi tuna was very tasty and definitely my favorite dish of the night.  The alligator meat was a bit on the chewy side, but not too bad.  I would skip it next time around though.    The service here on a busy Friday night was still great!  So glad we found this place and was able to eat right away.",

We had raw oysters  and shrimp on a stick  for appetizers ...( shrimp however, was  lightly breaded ) tasty but I normally do not eat fried...  For My mail course  which  I always take at least half home and in this case probably three quarters as it was a lot of food I had  the halibut with brussels sprouts and it was melting in my mouth fantastic!   They have a great happy hour beverage selection and a few good appetizers but a lot of it is fried.

Our server was horrible...she was pleasant however really should choose a different career path because serving is NOT it.  She was NOT timely with her service, came and took drink order, forgot to bring menus, brought some of the drinks \"oops I forgot his beer\", \"oops forgot your wine\", rushing us to order when we were still waiting on appetizer???  Got tired of waiting for the \"gluten free\" menu, so one of us went looking for one....  But here's the best part, we ordered a salad that two of us were going to share......you'd think - BRING an extra plate when you bring the salad, after all she knew we were sharing......NOPE! No plate..\"can you bring an extra plate, please?\"  \"OK\"........YEAH not sure where she went to find this elusive plate, because it never arrived, we had to share off the same plate .  Oh and if you're gluten free...be ready to be interviewed by a manager regarding your deficiency on gluten....REALLY, we need to discuss the level of allergy?....Gluten free is just that, NO GLUTEN in my food please, not rocket science!  No return visit for us - let corporate know, they said \"oh sorry, here's a gift card so can try us again\".................hmmmmmm",

    "text": "I don't think I will be visiting this restaurant anymore.  This past Thursday my second time visiting this location the 1st was in may of 2013 both times I was very disappointed in the service from the staff.    In May 2013 my family and I decided we wanted to have our monthly family dinner at the restaurant and my mother called to see if she could schedule a reservations since it would be about 12 of us on a Friday night,  she was told no and that we would have to come in and wait to be seated.  We came and of course it was busy,  we expected a 30-60 minute wait but after 90 minutes and seeing so many people be seated before us we go back to the hostess and she assures us that there is no table to accommodate us yet but she can sit us in an area that we will be close to each other.  With grumbling stomachs we agree.  When we are seated we are light years away from each other and there is no way for us to communicate with one another.  My mother brings it to the attention of the manager and he was able to fix the problem immediately and for her troubles comped one of the 4 meals she had on her ticket.  I had the blackened Mahi Mahi that night and it was absolutely amazing!   Fast forward to this past Thursday,  I took my mother for her birthday and it was an utter disappointment. I had Mahi Mahi with Alexander sauce and dirty rice.  My mother had the etoufee.  My fish was great but the rice was very undercooked and hard when I brought it to the attention of the manager and asked for a better cooked serving he said he would see what he could do but it may come from the same batch, which only tells me that he was planning on giving more guest that terribly hard rice.  My mother's etoufee was extremely greasy when brought to the servers attention he tried to say that's the way it's supposed to be but my mom is a regular there she knows what is supposed to taste like.  I was brought a fresh batch of rice that was delicious and my mother was able to order a new meal which she had to get to go because the grease from the etoufee upset her stomach and killed her appetite.  The server I wish I had his name was inattentive,  hardly checked up on us and was a bit rude after we complained about the food.  I thanked him twice and both times he looked with no response.  If I'm gonna spend $70 on a dinner for 2 I expect a friendly accommodating staff I get better service at my local burger King.",

As a matter fact I really dislike it however companion ordered it and of course I thought I'd try some again. It was delicious perfectly made.  The food came out promptly and it was very good except my rice and beans or very very spicy but good. The portions were also very good. I would most definitely go back to this restaurant the food was excellent the staff was friendly and professional and the wait was not long at all. I want to add that they don't have Jambolaya on the menu. Really strange for seafood place that spouts Cajun in Louisiana style seafood. Very big disappointment",

I would recommend this venue for \"power lunches\" and meetings with others.  Just walking in the door improves my mood.  For a date I would say, stop in for an appetizer and a glass of wine.

The food is generally really good and portions are just enormous. I like this place cuz of the oysters. Was a little disappointed that they didn't have the Blue Point, but for $5.99 a dozen for the Texas Gulf Coast was a score. The gumbo is always tasty. If you feel like sharing among others, order the Jumbo size that's not on the menu! The Greek salad was a good touch to all the heavy food that is served there too.   One side note for the bartender. When serving a shot of whiskey or anything else, please don't add crushed ice. It sorta ruins the drink. I'm just saying. You don't serve whiskey with crushed ice.   Bottom line: repeat for sure!",

    "text": "Ate here with my husband for a small dinner while we were visiting friends in Phoenix. Since this restaurant was within walking distance (less than a 5 minute walk) to the hotel we were staying in (Candlewood Suites), we decided to eat here. The first thing I thought of when we came in here was that this was one of those expensive tourist restaurants... and well it is (well duh, it's located right next to a few hotels).   Anyways, when we first came in here (sometime after 9 pm), no one acknowledged us. There was no one by the hostess area. So we waited by the front for a few minutes before deciding to just walk over to a table and seat ourselves. When we sat ourselves at a booth near the bar, a server saw us and brought us 2 menus.   We ordered the following:  Crispy Fried Alligator: We got a large order and was surprised that it didn't really come with a lot of pieces. Would really have liked to have more, especially since the price tag was a bit high. Anyways, my husband wanted to order this because well, how many opportunities do you get to eat alligator? It was tasty, but a little on the oily side. And it tasted like chicken (but you know, a lot of things taste like chicken). I don't know if I would ever order this again just because of the price tag and I didn't really feel like my palate was wowed a new culinary treat.  Louisiana Seafood Gumbo: We ordered a bowl to share and really liked the flavor of the gumbo. My husband just wished that there were more seafood pieces in this instead of just a few pieces of shrimp and mostly sausage.   The service we received was below average... Our server only came to our tables a total of 3 times (1 to get our order, 2 to bring us our food and 3 to bring us our check). He was not attentive to refilling our water and so I had to find another employee to get us some more water. The place wasn't even busy at all, there was just a handful of tables with people eating and no one at the bar. The place was basically empty (pretty spacious, which made the emptiness more noticeable).   The ladies' restroom was clean and there is plenty of parking in the lot.   Overall, would not come back. Food is overly priced and nothing seemed to wow us. This is just one of those tourist traps who just like the convenience of dining here due to proximity to their hotel.",

The oysters were probably the best I've ever had and the alligator was amazing! Not at all tough. Although on the menu it only lists the alligator as fried, they also serve it blackened which I totally recommend. They let us have half and half. Then for my main dish I got the Costa Rican Mahi Alexander. Although I only wanted the smaller portion, I forgot to say so, so I was given the larger and paid more than I expected. It was overall a very good dish though my scallops were a bit undercooked and my shrimp were a bit over. Over all a very good experience. I wouldn't mind going again but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again.",

Blue Point Oysters on the half shell, alligator bites, Jumbo Shrimp Brochette, Pasta Mardi Gras (spicy and creamy) and excellent desserts! Even the kid's menu was good.   Do yourself a favor and go indulge!!    Our server Audrey was great.  She gave us helpful tips, suggestions and kept a great pace on the food.

The person on the phone told me we couldn't do this at first but then luckily the manager did allow it.  Our table was ready when we arrived and food was on the table right at 12 o'clock when they said it would be. That was very nice.  The place itself is just beautiful. I really liked the style and feel of the restaurant. The food looked beautiful too.  I had the medium seafood lunch salad. It was ok. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste the dressing at all so I asked for more. They also brought out some bread and butter. Everyone else's food looked pretty good. Service wasn't bad either considering we were 8 people.  I do feel like my experience isn't complete yet. I definitely have to go back to try some other things on the menu. I love seafood so I'm happy to have found this place.",

I moved away from Phoenix for a while and couldn't wait to get back to my favorite restaurant; however, this was NOT the food quality I would have ever expected from here... We had soft shell crab (which was reeeeally small, soggy and had the taste of burned, old fryer oil.)  We also had the very tasteless and disappointing, ($20)Calamari appetizer and Crawfish Etouffee (yuck). The over-priced, baby portioned Brussels sprouts were amazing, however...  The only thing that saved the evening was the amazing server, Johnny! Simply wonderful service! It is 2 days later and we are just grateful we didn't end up sick...  So sad.  What a beautiful restaurant with wonderful servers, too bad the food quality has gone so far downhill. Until Friday, this was my favorite restaurant and with the money we spend there I am almost afraid to go back.",

    "text": "First visit to this location. Not the last. Probably not even the last this month. I have only been to one other Pappadeaux's...it was in an airport...and it was phenomenal (even though I only had 30 minutes to scarf down the food and drink)  I asked the waiter \"Sampler platter or seafood platter, pick one\" and he steered me to the seafood platter. Good choice! WAAaaaaaaAAAAyyyyy too much food, but nothing will go to waste. I'm set for lunch today AND dinner tonight. My fried food quota has been met.  Baked potato was tasty...but was quickly eclipsed by the tilapia...which was then put to shame by the stuffed crab (is it me or does it taste JUST LIKE my mom's stuffed crab? WOW! MY FAVORITE!!!) Next time I think I'll just look for a stuffed crab meal (after I check out the kitchen to make sure Mommy isn't being held captive for her culinary skills in there).   I have a hard time ordering crawfish from anywhere that isn't in Louisiana, but I might be persuaded to order it from here because the guy at the table next to ours looked like he was in some sort of throes of passion as he buried his head in the plate and licked his fingers (pinch da tails and suck da heads indeed! Maybe they should make one of the rooms in the restaurant ADULTS ONLY?!) . KINKY!!!   Mom in law had the mahi and grits and despite her tiny frame, she was having a hard time putting her fork down! The Hubster (wooooord up!) chose the fried crawfish meal and papa in law chose something that I can't remember w/ a cup of gumbo on the side and he barely uttered a word the entire meal. Shhhh....I'm eating. :)   If we didn't have King Cake waiting at home, we would've been happy to dive into their scrumptious looking dessert tray too, but alas, sometimes we must show a little restraint, mustn't we?  Oh...and the bread and butter at the beginning of the dining event was deliciously fresh and soft too...I'll definitely be back!",

But it wasn't and that was good for me...I got extraordinary attentive service by a young lady, by the name of Kayla, who is very knowledgable of the menu. I normally base service on how often they fill my water glass since I drink a lot of it and in the 35 minutes I was there she topped it off a good 3 times.   Now to the nitty gritty...I'm normally not a sandwich person but I like to try multiple things when I go to a restaurant for the first time. For an appetizer I ordered a half fried calamari and a lunch combo of a catfish po boy sandwich and a bowl of crawfish bisque. She asked if I wanted everything at once and I did since I had to get back to work.   Food came out quick, hot and delicious. Calamari didn't need the cocktail sauce or the lemon aioli it came with. I thought the aioli was a tad strong for the calamari but still good favor. I'm not a big fan or pickles on a sandwich but I figured if I'm gonna try it for the first time I might as well see what the complete sandwich is like and it was great. Crawfish bisque was buttery and flavorful. And last but not least...banana pudding!! I took dessert to go and it damn near put me in an food coma it was so good.   Strongly recommended!!",

I ordered mussels, which I have had before. When they came, I immediately was taken aback by the smell. I tried one and it turned to to mush in my mouth, I had to spit it out. From what I have learned, theses mussels were caught when spawning which cause their meat to turn to mush. Had to send back and order something else.  It is also very noisy and hard to have a good conversation. All in all, an ok experience, just ok food for a high price.",

Came back to the hotel and then we went to the Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen without reservations.  We had to wait for awhile, but that was OK as it gave our party of 10 time to soak in the atmo.  The approach is a bit of  \"round the block\" but once you get there it is a huge complex of dining, bar and patio areas.  Eclectic crowd, especially for Phoenix.  They had a troubador playing a soft electric guitar and spillin' his lyrics out on the patio.  Lots of fried food.  Their seafood dishes looked tasty.  I asked where the salmon was caught and found out several of their seafood dishes were farm raised.  I am picky about eating fish that was caught in the wild and not farmed.  I had a deep fried chicken and shrimp dish with fries that was good.  Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen will probably not see me again as not really my cup of tea.",

We didn't realize it, but February 14th is smack dab in the middle of Mardi Gras, so Pappadeaux was quite busy! The courtyard is beautiful, though, with live music, ample seating, and this time popcorn, cheese, and sausage was being given out while you waited, along with bottled water and Mardi Gras beads. The wait was projected to be 30-45 minutes, but we were seated in 20 minutes.   The food was delicious, as always, and the service was friendly and adequate to good. It was a very busy day, so I understand that it is difficult to keep the drinks full. I chose the Blackened Mahi Alexander Style, my husband chose the Blackened Mahi lunch special, and my mother got the Tilapia lunch special. The spices were bold and impressive. Loved the grilled shrimp with my dinner. For dessert, we got creme brulee and pecan sweet potato pie with vanilla bean ice cream. So. Totally. Delicious. This is one of my favorite places to get creme brulee.   I always look forward to my lunches and dinners at Pappadeaux. I was not disappointed!",

So, the chances of getting fresh seafood is slim to none. But I've always found Pappadeaux's to come through in that department! Not only are their oysters the bomb dot com but so are the crab fingers! I would also recommend picking out a lobster, most especially the larger ones to share because it is worth it! Desert is always great, too! We've celebrated birthdays and graduations here. I mean, what's not to celebrate here?! Staff are on top of their game and so is their food.",

I don't think it could have been any more salty if someone had purposely tried to over do it.  The prices also rather shocked me but I knew it would be expensive to have fresh seafood in the desert. Almost all entrees start at about $30 and go up from there. And then there is exorbitant up selling of salads and side dishes. Also be prepared for extreme noise levels during dinner. This was my last dining experience here.  I don't wish to overpay AND get hyper-tension.",

Our server was Robert, he gets an A plus in customer service..We started with Water ,wine, Ice Tea, and my girl got coffee. He brought lemons and straws for our water, Brewed fresh coffee and kept my Ice Tea refilled the entire night. The meals were incredible. Our appetizer  was to die for.    The meals are huge ,we had to take it to go and we had enough for dinner on Sunday. Mediterranean Calamari was so good!  We did not like the Capers in it, but it also comes with fired artichoke!!  Lobster Bisque, was probably the best i have ever had!  The Lobster,Crab, and Talapia were all very fresh. They say they have it flown in every day. I believe it because, it was as i said fantastic!    The decor is very good, dark wood, everything nice and big.    We cannot wait to come back here. Lots of Parking in the lot.",

I thought it was just going to be a piece but to my surprise they brought me a new Wild King Alaskan Salmon! If that's not customer service then I don't know what is! The staff does a fine job of keeping your glasses full and keeping your table just happy to be there at the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone....

    "text": "I told myself I would Yelp on every restaurant that I ate at on the course of this \"road trip\" I'm taking, so here goes.  We started off in the familiar territory of Phoenix, AZ.  Our \"go to\" spot in the northern suburbs of Phoenix used to be the Fish Market in Scottsdale, but since it \"changed hands\" so to speak, we've been on the look out for another destination.  Well... I think we found it in Pappadeaux.  Service:  5/5  The service we received at Pappadeaux was outstanding from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  It was about 7:30 on a Friday evening when we got to the restaurant, and since we had been traveling, I did not have the opportunity to make reservations ahead of time.  The parking lot was VERY crowded and we were afraid of a long wait time.  But we were quoted 5-10 minutes when we arrived, and were seated after 7 minutes.  We got one of the few booths in the restaurant near the bar area.  Our waiter, Nate, was very attentive and helpful.  He pointed out some of their more famous dishes and the specials, some of which we ended up ordering.  He was prompt in refilling our water glasses when needed and even stopped a moment to chat with us about our 4-month old son.  The only small blemish I would mention is that dessert was a long time in coming.  It took about ten minutes after we ordered it.  Now I know they don't bake cheesecakes on the fly, so I'm unsure about the reason for the delay, but I thought in the interest of being complete that I would mention it.  Food:  5/5  Absolutely no complaints here.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  My wife and I got the baked oyster trio and split a Greek salad for appetizers.  The salad was great and so were the oysters.  The salad is served table-side for that extra little touch.  If we were to order again though, I think we would have just gotten a full order of the Parmesan baked oysters instead of the trio.  For entrees, I ordered the special of the evening which was Salmon Diablo, a blackened salmon fillet with extra kick.  The only very minor complaint I would note is the sauce was a bit too much.  It was absolutely delicious, a mix of crab meat and butter and cream, but it overpowered the fish to a degree.  I ended up eating it separately.   As I said, delicious, but a bit much.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque and it was every bit as good as other reviewers have commented.  For dessert we split a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm always on the look out for new and interesting desserts, and while I have had tons of cheesecakes, this was a combination I hadn't encountered before, so I had to give it a try.  The sweet potato pie also looked interesting, but we went with the cheesecake.  Aside from the delay mentioned above, no complaints here.  The cake was moist, flavorful, and delicious.  Overall Impressions:  5/5  The environment at Pappadeaux is exactly what you would expect.  They do a good job of bringing in that Cajun/creole atmosphere and balance an upscale look with a \"down home\" attitude.  You'll feel right at home here in your t-shirt and jeans, or in your business attire after a long day at the office.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating.    Overall if you are looking for a seafood or creole meal in the Phoenix area, I can heartily recommend Pappadeaux.",

We were seated at 5 pm and the menus stated the crawfish is available at 5. Ok, no biggie.  I place my order then I'm told \"sorry we don't have any crawfish\". So I ordered the soft shell crab and my son ordered the steak Oscar medium rare.  Our food arrived, mine is ice cold, my son's steak is still mooing and my sister's food was cold.  The server asked us once in a 2 hour time frame if we needed anything.  I will NOT waste my gas to make the trip here again.",

    "text": "This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.  My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.  Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, \"So are you gonna do this or what?\" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.  The food was good, but it's not always about the food. The service was horrible. Don't think I'd ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service.",

(too crazy, very loud, poor lighting, high traffic)  Seating outside is another story, especially in the fall. It is beautiful. The food is great and definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon as I had heard it was excellent there. I've never been a big fan of salmon and have had several bad experiences with it in other restaurants. My first bite was timid, but by the end I thought I was going to start licking the crumbs off my cedar plank. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.  My dish also came with some of the largest asparagus I've had. I'm always very leery of large asparagus as it is almost always too firm. Once again, grilled to perfection just like the salmon.   The wait staff was also very courteous and enjoyable. Overall a great experience after we had moved to the courtyard area. I highly suggest, especially if you are a fan of all you can eat lobster.",

The salmon Oscar was roasted slowly , so it was a glistening, flakey slab, slathered in crab, shrimp, and scallops with a sauce I SWEAR I could have licked off the plate.  My piece of sea bass was larger than a tennis ball, slathered with a gooey cheese, and seasoned top to bottom, resting on a perfectly sauteed mess of spinach.  Really.  I cannot stop thinking about how danged good it was.  Wine list was fine, Key lime pie needed to be a little more tart, but that is a personal preference.

I'd been here once before and really enjoyed it and appreciate how flavorful the creole-inspired dishes are!  We had the crispy fried alligator and shrimp and crawfish fondeaux to start. After living on the Gulf Coast, the alligator was not a \"shock\" to me as it is to some people and it was fun and tasty. The fondeaux was rich and yummy!   A brief flashback to my first Pappadeaux experience reminded me not to fill up too much on apps, since I ended up taking up most of my entree home. I did not listen to that little voice. We ordered our entrees -- Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain for me and Pasta Mardi Gras for him -- including a cup of gumbo. Our friends ordered their entrees too, including the lobster bisque (YUM! The gumbo was good, but the bisque was GREAT!).   Sure enough...by the time our entrees arrived, I was full again!! Fail for me, because the food was all soooo very tasty! The waitress was amazing and willing to box everything up for us.   And the cherry on top?  Well, Pappadeaux's has a mean birthday brownie a la mode that was HUGE and delicious! Needless to say, I've got enough food for 2 days...  I definitely am a fan of this place, especially among Phoenix seafood options...and though there seems to always be a wait, the courtyard is lovely to hang out in while you wait for a table.",

    "text": "Being from New Orleans, I was really looking forward to having a dinner here. The opportunity came when I was asked where I wanted to go for my birthday so off we went.   Openers was Fried Oysters, oh how I miss them, but they were merely satisfying. Buried in French Fries, I found about six small ones. We had another appetizer, don't remember what, that we didn't want to finish. It wanted to take home so we flagged a waiter and asked him to put it in a box so it wouldn't sit uncovered on the table for the entire meal. We had our entrees coming anyway. I ordered the Shrimp Etouffee and the other was a pasta dish of sorts.   After about 15 minutes our entrees arrive in a bag. They had packed the whole order to go! We explained the problem and the bag went back to the kitchen.   About 10 minutes later the entrees, and apologies, arrived.  The pasta dish my partner ordered looked and tasted wonderful. The Etouffee looked sad. Over warmed, dry, and tasted it. But it was a birthday gift so I kept my mouth shut and enjoyed the company.   As we were leaving, I took the waitress aside and apologized for the confusion and asked what had been remade and what had been poured onto a plate and sat to warm under a lamp. You guessed it.   Now, two wait-persons were involved. Hey, our original disappeared. But you would think she might stop by to check with us before packed up the order based on a message from a trainee. (Our mistake)  But, really, what would it have cost them to remake both entrees as it was their mistake.   Perhaps a one-off issue but the oysters were disappointing and well, the service badly managed.",

Everything is fresh, tastes wonderful, the staff is on point meets your every need and is very courteous and polite, on weekends they have a live band playing in their court yard while you enjoy cocktails and an appetizer if the wait is long and you have to wait for a table, check this place out you won't regret it it's one of my favorites, I go there every year for my birthday.",

I had the crawfish combo while she had the salmon. entrees are pricey at $25 but after we tasted the food it was worth it. ask for bread if you want to have something to much on. they gave us a free cheesecake since it was my gfs bday. definitely a special occasion type of place and it was overall excellent.",

    "text": "My family and I love to get together and have a big dinner here when we can all plan it on the same night! The last time I ate here was about a year ago and since then I have converted to eating a vegan diet. I wasn't too worried because I saw someone's review that they had a pasta and it was really good. When we got there I asked Kami, our waitress, if I could just get a plain pasta with marinara and some steamed or roasted vegetables and she was very knowledgable on how the food was prepared and made sure there was no butter or dairy anywhere near my plate, which after having some bad experiences, I am SUPER grateful for. She was so sweet and she made sure I was happy with everything that came out. We also had an incident where someone's lobster wasn't fully cooked. It came out of the shell still clear and Kami had no problem taking it back to see what she could do for us. Half of the lobster was eaten and was pretty much cooked, it was really just one claw that didn't get fully cooked and the manager at the time Drew was so sweet as she brought back the claw fully cooked and told us that the whole lobster was on the house and that she was extremely sorry for the undercooked lobster. That was really amazing because you just don't get service like that anymore. I can't remember the last time that I had to send food back and the manager actually comes out, let alone takes the dish off the bill.  Always 5 stars and a great time. They are even open until midnight on Fridays! But it is True that they don't bring breadsticks out unless you ask for them.",

As soon as I was leaving the restaruant I got sick in the bathroom.  As we were leaving the parking lot, my entire head and neck broke out in hives-and I don't have a seafood allergy. My date is now also sick and we shared the food.  He is having severe stomach issues.

Based on the reviews we orders the gator tail. We were so full we couldn't order dessert.   And then to top it off, I was so happy, full, and distracted, I forgot my purse at the table.

We went as a group and ordered the Blue Point oysters, Mediterranean Calamari, Boudin and Shrimp Cocktail as appetizers.      Oysters  - fantastic, fresh - great presentation - on special for $10 a dozen.   Heaven.  Mediterranean Calamari - Wow they took calamari to a whole new level.   I won't ruin the surprise - just try it.    Boudin - I'm a bit of a freak when it comes to Boudin (aka Blood Sausage).   I like mine with more blood and less filler.   Theirs is more filler with less blood.   It's also quite spicy.   I had to try it, but probably wouldn't order it again. Shrimp Cocktail - Really nice sized fresh tasting shrimp.   Really nice presentation on a bed of crushed ice.   Great appy.  Dinners- I had their Salmon Alexander.    What is Alexander?   Grilled Shrimp.   Grilled Scallops.  Crawfish.   In a LEMON BUTTER WINE OMG SO GOOD SAUCE.  All of this on top of perfectly grilled salmon.  Came with dirty rice, which, on the scale of dog barf to awesome - you guessed it - awesome.  (full disclosure - never ate dog barf before - probably won't eat dog bark ever).  Dessert - Didn't indulge.  Service - You would think you were in a place where they somehow bred servers or grew them on trees.  There are so many of them buzzing around taking care of your every need in a prompt manner.    (I think I finally figured out why there are so many cars in the parking lot - they have a ton of servers!)  Give it a try - I promise - you won't be disappointed.  Just don't go anytime I'm going there so I can get a table, OK???",

The only reason for knocking off one star is really a suggestion for management. At 8:00 p.m., we waited outside, in 101 degree heat for 35 minutes. The heat was oppressive and the outdoor ceiling and standing fans were completely ineffective; in fact, they made the heat more unbearable. I might suggest, especially when you have older patrons, that you assign a wait staff to provide water to those waiting outside. Follow the example of home builders in the Phoenix area; you can't walk into one of their model homes without a salesperson offering a cold bottle of water. Your waiters should be offering glasses of water to your patrons waiting outside, especially when temperatures exceed 100 degrees.",

We were sat close to the hostess stand and upon leaving the second gal was much nicer. It just is frustrating to assume that all kids will be have badly!  The food was ok. It's been a few years since we've been and it didn't seem to live up to the expectations we had. The flavors were nice but the selection of only fish with no shellfish seemed small. The only non seafood appetizer option was mozzarella sticks. That was a bummer.   I asked the server for her recommendation and she suggested the grilled chicken. This doesn't really build your faith in the seafood restaurant if the servers favorite is chicken.   Bottom line, it's ok but not worth the price!",

As my main dish I got the redfish with shrimp and oh my, it was amazing. Lastly I tried both the bread pudding (forgot the name) and the pecan pie. Both of these deserts were phenomenal. Over all my experience here was great. The service was on point, the food tasted great but just one negative thing about this place were the tables being way to close to each other.",

We also ordered a cup of the andouille sausage and seafood gumbo. Yup, another mind blowing experience! So good. Make sure to mix it up well before you eat it, the way it's intended to be eaten. We also ordered (yes, we were hungry, don't judge), the filet mignon oscar. The only issue was there wasn't much lump crab meat, in fact it was next to nothing on the filet so they ended up taking that off our bill. Still so delish and they followed up and took care of us.  I highly recommend this place, great atmosphere and amazing food.",

Last night took two guests for a birthday dinner.  Place was empty but by the time we placed our order (45 mins later!) it was packed.  Server (Bryan) was in the worst I can remember; unfriendly, ignorant about the menu, rude to all three of us, failed to offer more drinks, never came back to ask about meals, and this is only the beginning.  To start I ordered oysters appetizer; at 6:30 on a Tuesday they were all out.  Came time to order dinner and chose crab legs; guess what, all out.  Now I know this isn't the server's fault, but in addition, two lobster dinners were completely charred black, dry and tough - like lobster jerkey.  After 1 1/2 hrs. no time to send back so stuck it out.  At one point Bryan was no where to be seen for over half an hour.  He never came to offer dessert until we flagged him down for our bill.  Got there at 6PM and were out at 8:50 - that's how long this disaster took.",

    "text": "The last few years while visiting our family in Phoenix, we seem to always fit in a visit here. Despite what my check-ins say, this was our 3rd visit and we have become quite the fans. The first time I came here, I was at the tail end of my pregnancy so instead of seafood, I chose the Pappardelle Pasta with spinach and butternut squash. It was pretty tasty but it was also pretty heavy.  This last two visits, I went for the live Maine lobster and I was in heaven. I thought it would be a lot of work but the kitchen did a really good job preparing it so the lobster meat came out of the shell really easy. This plate comes with pappardelle pasta but this last visit, I gave that to my little one to eat and got the cheese grits with andouille and corn for my side.  It was a good choice because not only were the grits super yummy, the pasta was the perfect size for the little one. She's going through a phase where all she wants is noodles and broccoli so it fit the profile. Even though the menu is extensive, this might have to be my go-to item on the menu. Can you ever go wrong with live main lobster?   This restaurant is really large which means it can pack a lot of people in...which means it's LOUD but the perfect place to bring a toddler. ; ) To keep with her bedtime routine, we made a reservation for (5:15 pm) and still, we had to wait 10 minutes for our table. I was amazed how busy it already was.   That being said, I'd highly recommend making reservations if you plan to come here. The place is a hot spot and I can see why.  We can't wait until our next years visit. ; )",

Never been but always game for good seafood.  We walked in at 9 PM and were told it would be a minute for them to clean a table for us but the hostess gave us a buzzer and we headed to the bar. The bartenders were polite but were more concerned with interacting with themselves, talking smack about football teams and \"Woo Boys Rick Flair\" than interacting with us.  Twenty minutes at the bar and I notice a couple walk in and be seated. Then a group of four walks in and is seated. After a couple walked in and was seated, The Boy walked over and asks about our buzzer and how we saw other tables being seated but not ours. No apology from the male host, just \"umm we can seat you now\".  Our server Nick continued with the poor experience. He was either new, in the weeds, or honestly did not care about our table. Every time he stopped at our table he was two steps past us on to the next table before we could answer. He stopped to check on how our food was and was taking the table behind ours margarita order before either of us could speak. He also floundered when describing the two dishes I was on the fence about. He described the Texas Redfish Pontchartrain as \"tasting more like fish\" than the shrimp and scallop dish but did slightly rebound with the description of the Shrimp & Scallop Orecchiette Pasta, which I ultimately ordered. I do give him props for not pushing the more expensive dish, which often happens with servers who only want to upsell.   Other table around us received a crusty loaf of bread and butter before their entrees.  I even heard another server rave about how everyone loves their french loaf but none was offered to us or even mentioned.  The food itself was very good. The Boy got the Pasta Mardi Gras and loved it. The portion was huge and The Boy loved the spices and the mix of seafood and Andouille sausage.  He was head over heals for the Cheese Grits Andouille & Corn.   I started with the Cesar salad which was very good. I ordered the above mentioned Orecchiette pasta which was also very good but was disappointed by the amount of shrimp and scallops in the dish. The dish had 3, ok sized shrimp, and 4 mediumish scallops..   Although our experience was disappointing, I watched the tables around us and was impressed by the service.  Servers and bussers worked as a cohesive team while the servers themselves gave exceptional service and attention to their tables.  Will our meh experience cloud us from coming back? I can't say since we don't live in the area but I can say I would be back in a heartbeat if we has the experience everyone else around us had.",

I get the catfish with a baked potato (extra charge for that $3.50).  The catfish was outstanding. We got a freebie desert. I used to getting my catfish from Lolo's. But, Pappadeaux's is much better. But, it is much more expensive, so I would stick with Lolo's. You get sides with it there. The service was very good (thanks to Noel). Great place to go for special occasion, not a weekly venture unless you're rich.",

    "text": "I LOVE seafood! So this was a NO brainer especially since this was my very FIRST visit to this franchise.   The ambiance inside this particular location is a lil dark yet cozy and can easily be intimate for those occasions. my first observation and top concern, iWas NOT offered or served ANY bread & butter after being seated. However, when iDid look around to view and absorb the ambiance iNoticed every other table had bread in a basket, Hmmm??? My Waitress also seems very RUSHED!  My order was correct and delivered surprisingly very quickly! Which made the food Decadently delicious. It was hot and the serving portions are fulfilling. My entire plate was explosive with a variety of spices and savory flavors to indulge your sense of taste in.   This was my first time trying Tilapia fish and it was delicious! Also my first time eating Alligator. Alligator meat is a lil chewy and IF perhaps you didn't know it was Alligator you were eating you would believe you were eating Chicken. The kicker to this appetizer is The Sauce it's served with - Nums! Nums!   BTW, it was also my first time trying Banana Pudding and it's a dessert iWill NEVER eat again! It was nasty, yuck! Not to mention it was recommended by the waitress that night.   I will visit another Pappadeaux again for sure, hoping iGet my bread served after being seated.",

    "text": "As soon as my friends and I got seated here, a man came to our table to greet us--or so we thought. Instead, he complained about my partially consumed $7 Starbucks drink which I'd placed at my table setting, telling us we couldn't have any non-Pappadeaux-branded items in here. I'm sure he thought I'd hand over said contraband to him or throw it out myself, but I said, fine and I set it down on the floor next to my purse out of his reach instead. He grumbled, but accepted that. Turns out he was the MANAGER! Really?!? The manager's first contact is to humiliate their customers in public? So, for the next five minutes we discussed whether or not to walk out of the place and never come back again.   Meanwhile, waitress Catie came by and we decided to place a drink order, while still contemplating whether to walk out or not before placing our food order. Catie got 5-stars throughout, BTW, and ultimately earned her generous tip. She was the only reason we stayed (besides hunger and limited time). We ended up ordering over $100 worth of food for three, but only because of Catie. And also maybe because the drinks eventually made our collective blood pressures finally return to normal.   The food was great (4-stars?) but it was overpriced and at times, uninspiring. A splash of brandy or sherry would have made the lobster bisque better, for instance. They pushed the octopus on the menu way too hard. I suspect they had more octopi back in the kitchen than the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We didn't order any. They took formerly great dishes off the menu (Lobster Mac and Cheese, Lobster Roll, more?) and replaced these with, well, more octopi dishes.  Tried multiple times to upload food photos but couldn't--sorry! Suspect that's a Yelp issue and not a Pappadeux one, though.  No complaints about the waitress service, but can't say the same about service overall, thus the 2-star rating here. Will I go back? Probably not, although I'd be tempted to follow Catie to her next job some day.",

    "text": "Our party of 3 came in around 5:45 on Friday without reservations after noting ratings and ++ comments by hotel staff. So we had a 45 minute wait time noting patrons seated outside and a packed bar at happy hour.   So we decide to order a couple drinks on the HH special and the fried gator with fries. The dipping sauce was to die for and the drinks well loaded with booze:-).   It wasn't a great start for service as the barkeep had issues with the POS so maybe about 15 minutes for service. But we were happy with the results. But service time got progressively worse at dinner. It took over 10 minutes just to be recognized after seating and by that time we fortunately knew what to order. Service never bothered to check on our meal, and our water glasses remained empty as we had to ask for the dessert menu.   So why 4 stars when the service was barely north of 1?  The food was that good. Period. I've been to NOLA a couple times and I'm no expert to claim the food isn't traditional (it was a bit different than I had experienced), but it was absolutely FANTASTIC!  The shrimp etoufee was superb and the Mardi Gras Pasta was it's equal. And to top it off, the bread pudding hit the sweet spot.   5+ stars for food and 1.5 for service taking nearly 1 h 45 m to complete the meal.",

The waiter was apologetic and implied they were having kitchen issues.  I had the catfish lunch plate that came with a shrimp, toast gravy dish on the side and fries. (Sorry I can't recall what the side was called) Fries were really bad, also tasted old. Plenty of shrimp with dish and the gravy was good. Pretty heavy dish! I'll agree with Cindy N- definitely a ton of salt in their dishes. The catfish was tasty. My other half had the Pasta Mardi Gras and enjoyed it, seemed to be plenty of seafood in it as well. Although he said there was very little heat to it.   I don't know if we will rush here again.",

    "text": "When a restaurant - or any business - posts a price, then that is the price that the customer should expect to pay. Period. So, what the heck?  I'm more than familiar with the practice of items like live Maine lobster being priced as \"market\" since it can change from one day to the next.  The posted price above the lobster tank clearly stated that the price for a 1lb. lobster was $21.95. When the bill arrived, it was charged at $23.95. Granted, not a big difference. But, a difference. The server's explanation was that the menu price had recently changed. OK. So?   There was an opportunity here to make right. Strike one when the server made the comment that she did. Strike two was when the server returned to the table with the payment having been processed but the price having not changed and no mention of a floor manager being consulted. Too bad, the differential came straight out of the tip!  Strike three was when mention was made to the women at the hostess stand directly next to the posted sign with prices. The reaction was very under-whelming. No apology. More of a casual brush-off.  Look, I get it. Pappadeaux has been a valley institution for decades. And, they pack the place every day. But, ya know, when things like this happen, there can be a tipping point and things can turn on something as simple as this: if you post a price, then charge that price. Period. If you want to change it on the fly, then make every posting say \"market rate,\" or \"ask server for price quote.\" Just because they do a pretty good job of steaming lobster and charge a reasonable price isn't enough any more.  Oh, and the lobster this time? Well, we ordered two. Each of us got one half of one lobster and one half of the other lobster. How do we know? One person got brain with each half and the other got none. One was steamed perfectly. The other was over-done and chewy. One had a nice, long, vein still in it having not been cleaned properly.  Maybe, just maybe, Pappadeaux is no longer worth the hype that took them decades to build.  Management: read some of the less than perfect reviews. Take note. Make changes. Or, maybe you've gotten so big now-a-days that you really couldn't care less...  Gonna be a while before I come back. I'm disappointed.",

I plan to try and call management in the morning to inform them of this as well so that no one else hets  Update..... it's been a week tomorrow and I have not heard from anyone from Pappadeaux at all! I spoke with Stephanie a manager on Sunday last week and she advised I would be getting a Call from the home office in a few days and I have yet to get a call back!

We ordered appetizers and drinks, then seemed to have lost our waitress. When she came back around we asked to order entrees and, while apologetic, also told us, oh? I thought you'd just be ordering appetizers.  The alligator we ordered was blackened and fried. The blackened alligator tasted different this time. My mother said it seemed to lack the same signature seasoning.  There was nobody to tell, as nobody asked us how our meal was. Meals finally came, we took some home. Got home to finish off my ahi tuna and bit into one of the pieces and felt something sharp. Pulled it out of my mouth to find what???  Someone's finger nail they seemed to have slice off with a knife. I used to work in kitchens, I know this happens, but also know you are supposed to throw the dish away if there is any chance it had the foreign object in the food you are serving.  Really disappointed all around with our visit this time. Really appears the quality has gone down with this restaurant. Very sad!  Especially since we dropped a pretty penny on dinner tonight.",

A perfect combination of texture and taste. Try the coconut shrimp appetizer. We were debating between the crab cakes and coconut shrimp. The waiter recommended the shrimp and said Pappadeaux's is known for their coconut shrimp. I now know why. So delicious. I highly recommend. It was worth the drive from Gilbert to Sunnyslope.",

I have had the jambalaya and the etoufee here and both were adequate, though I had to douse on the Tabasco to truly make the flavor something I desired.  I would recommend this place to somebody interested in a casual happy hour or a family who wants to eat their fill as the quantity was quite large.",

I had a margarita; not bad but to sour for my liking. Hub had a draft beer and it was served in an ice, ice, ice cold mug. At 6:00 we were seated at our table right away and our server, Gerald, was at our table in an instant with pen in hand asking us if we had been to Pappadeaux before and if we had any questions before he informed us about the menu. We had the lump crab spinach dip for a starter, good flavor but not much lump crab to be found in ours.  We had the fried soft shell crab for our dinner and it was YUMMMMMMMMY!!!

    "text": "Oh Pappadeaux's, how I wish you were closer to my home. If I didn't have to drive 40-45 minutes to get there, I would probably spend my entire paycheck on two things: Oysters and Fried Alligator. As such, I'm going to stick to those two things in my review. Those are really the only two things that I eat when I go, because I cannot get enough of them.  First things first, the staff and ambiance. The music can get a little bit loud, but the atmosphere is always fun and upbeat. The staff all seems to be pretty friendly, too. Our server was especially friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place I like to go to with my friends to hang out and have a good night.  Now, I'll talk about the food. First, the oysters. The oysters here are great! They give you a few different sauces to go along with them, each of which has a distinct, delicious flavor to add. To make the oysters even better, they have incredible deals on them! They only cost about $4.00 per dozen for the special they supposedly have running almost all the time. The type of oysters that you get on the special vary based on whatever factors affect the catching of oysters. As for the Fried Alligator, IT'S FRIED ALLIGATOR. As soon as I saw it on the menu, I had to have it. To quote one of my favorite movies (Transformers), \"Alligator is the most succulent meat.\" The Fried Alligator here is one of my favorite things to eat. I absolutely cannot have enough Fried Alligator. The meat is moist and juicy with a light and non-fishy flavor, and the batter/breading layer is fried crisp. That combo of the moist meat with the crispy outside is phenomenal. Add on the dusting of cajun seasoning and the creole dipping sauce, and you have a dish you won't forget.   In conclusion, I definitely recommend this place. I can't really speak for anything other than the oysters and the fried alligator, but do I need to? Come on, it's Fried Alligator and cheap oysters! Stop reading and go to Pappadeaux's!",

My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner, it was my favorite place and we have been coming here for 8 years. I ordered the lobster bisque and he ordered the clam chowder. Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better.... And Pappadeaux, no need to respond to my review because no apology is going to be good enough to have me dine in your establishment again.",

Last night my husband Michael and I went out to dinner to celebrate my new job, we went to Pappadeaux which we had been numerous time before but last night I have to say we had the BEST server that Pappadeaux has her name is Kara Reveas and she listen to want we liked she picked up on the fact that my husband doesn't eat meat so when she brought our meals out she replaced his dirty rice with white rice since they prepare their dirty rice with meat. She offered us choices to try on our return visit of certain items on the menu. You could see when she explained how they prepared the meal that she was passionate in her job and wanting the customer to have a wonderful food experience. We also meet the Manager from Mississippi Cori Woods she was absolutely wonderful as well very charming and caring you could tell that she really enjoys her work. If you haven't eaten there please stop in you will be so happy that you did. The food, atmosphere and service is 5 Stars and remember to ask for Kara she works Thursday evenings.  Oh and the Alligator is great you need to try it!!!!!!",

In recent years we hadn't been here so when friends suggested we meet there to celebrate two wedding anniversaries it seemed a good idea. I am not so sure now. Friends split the halibut special and were enthusiastic. I ordered a wedge salad and the mussel appetizer and was happy enough.  My wife had the clam chowder and shrimp cocktail and was disappointed with quality of shrimp and said the chowder was terrible. She loved her cheesecake dessert and our friends enjoyed the creme brulee and pecan pie.  Interestingly enough the salad our friends had came in a separate course whereas the salad I ordered and my wife's chowder came with our other dish which overfilled the table. Wine list was ok.  Waitress was seldom around. Water and ice tea ran dry. It was busy. I still feel this chain normally does a better job. We did get free desserts.",

The restaurant was unbelievably packed for a random Monday, but I was a tad annoyed that we still had to wait about a half hour to be seated- and that was with a reservation.   Our waitress was great and got Hubby's requisite Oyster, Crawfish, and Mushroom \"Fondeaux\" started right away. That kind of chain-y cutesy naming cheesiness makes me roll my eyes, but Hubby is blind to such lameness since Pappa's has a whole empire of similarly named restaurants in Texas (from where he moved to Arcosanti whence I snagged him- but I digress). He also ordered some kind of layered frozen fruity monstrosity that made him positively loopy (in his defense, we're not big drinkers).  After the Fondeaux appetizer, we barely had room for our entrees, so we both have excellent lunches today. I had a mixed seafood grill which had very nicely cooked pieces of scallop, mahi, and salmon together with way too well done shrimp. In apparently some sort of fugue state I also ordered a side of onion rings which I promptly regretted when the platter came out bigger than my head. They were mighty tasty, though, and I have not had much luck before finding really good onion rings (except at Ted's Hot Dogs, of course). Hubby ordered a crawfish platter with fried pieces and etoufee, but the waitress  convinced him to get the triple slam with blackened crawfish as well- and this turned out to be his favorite on the plate. All the portions are gargantuan, so we have to remember next time to share an entree, especially if we need to get the Fondeaux. Which I'm sure we will...",

Passed this place on the way home from the airport on December 29th, and as a huge fan of Cajun food, I had to stop in. I had to give 5 stars because the food, the service, and the New Orleans ambiance were all to a tee. We got a couple fancy (expensive) cocktails while we waited at the bar for our table. Drinks weren't anything special, but the bartenders very friendly, and offered bread and butter while we waited. We didn't have to wait long before we sat, and if it were warmer out, I would not have minded having cocktail hour on their awesome patio before dinner. You would never know this place is right next to one of Phoenix's busiest freeways. We sat down and our waiter was Bo L(sorry if i didn't get his name right, my receipt rubbed his name off). Anyways we ordered some wine and tried their oyster and shrimp appetizer. Not impressive. But everything else was. Their Lobster Bisque was rich and tasty and I ordered the Seafood Gumbo that came with my Shrimp Po' Boy. My mom ordered her favorite, the Crawfish Etouffee which was superior. My Po' Boy was good, but it was the fried and seasoned shrimp that really made the sandwich. My seafood Gumbo was very authentic and delicious, but i am a sucker for Lobster Bisque which I thought was better. We also ordered a side of their Mushroom Risotto which was cheap and very flavorful. I cannot wait to come here again next weekend when I am visiting. I did some research for good cajun in LA, and cannot find any in, out of all places, Los Angeles. I will have to go to Phoenix for good cajun.",

It's lively, and is beautiful building with a red brick courtyard. The staff is knowledgeable, and very helpful to someone raised here and not that familiar with the great variety of seafood. I usually tip larger there than any other place. I've been accused of having moths fly out of my wallet so I have to rate this place very highly. In fact, for seafood I've been here the most often, having been very disappointed with other places in the valley.",

Not only that but when they did mess up and gave me mushroom risotto before I even realized the fact that it was not what I ordered (no joke was on the table maybe 2 minutes) they had the risotto replacement on the table! APOLOGIZED AND!! YES AND!! Offered to re-plate it!... this wasn't the waitress apologizing... IT WAS THE CHEF! Talk about making me feel really important. The scallops were amazing the herb risotto was amazing and even the desert (which was given to us on the house for coming there to celebrate) of creme brule blow my mind. I had a food high and floated like a overfilled happy balloon all the way home.",

My girls like the Lobsters in the tank when you walk in (Larry the Lobster) and the patio is very beautiful and relaxing while you wait. They have so many people working there and the place is always packed. We drive 22 miles one way to eat here and have never been disappointed. The portions are huge and we always end up eating the left over's for lunch the next day. They also have a balloon artist that wonders around and my girls love him.",

But tonight we discovered a new thing to love here at Pappadeaux: the chargrilled salmon diablo! Perfectly prepared - and the flavors of the mesquite-grilled salmon were perfectly complemented by the slightly tangy diablo cream sauce, with big tasty pieces of crab and crawfish in it. Even the broccoli was delicious! Steamed with a light sprinkling of garlic lemon olive oil and a touch of warm red pepper flakes. Love!!!",

    "text": "Well we made the mistake of going here on a Friday night at about 7pm.  This place was packed.  Strange considering the average price of a dinner is around 20 bucks.  But we decided to try anyways.  I have been here before but that was maybe six years ago.   Upon arrival we went to the hostess table and she told us there would be a two hour wait.  She said that if you wait for a table in the bar you can get one of those tables first come first serve.  So we took a number and hung out in the bar.  About 20 minutes of waiting in the bar we got two seats at the bar.  Lucky.  The bar staff is very friendly and very fast considering this place was absolutely packed!      We ordered two of the specialty drinks called the swamp thing!   they were damn tasty.  I don't know how much alcohol is in one but that's all I needed for the rest of the night!  We also ordered some fried alligator as an appetizer.  The alligator taste like a  cross of fish with a chicken texture.  It is very tasty! The presentation was also nice not messy or greasy.  We then ordered our dinner.    She got the Shrimp Etoufee and I got the Pontchartrain Fish.  The shrimp etoufee came in a smoky sauce with dirty rice.  The Pontchartrain was the fish of the day which was tilapia and had shrimp and crab meat in a butter sauce with dirty rice.  The food is outstanding!  Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh.  The fish has no fishy taste or smell to it.  Its as if it came off the boat and served in your plate.    Overall I say two thumbs way up!  For an expensive dinner this place is worth it.  Date night yes, want to surprise the family with some creole food YES!     Only thing I would say is that come early and hungry! Also if it is date night the bar is the way to go.  You don't even have to get alcohol you can get a soda and order food.",

First of all I want to say our waitress was great. The three of us ordered Pasta Mardi Gras. I was so disappointed. I got a bowl of pasta with pink sauce and a couple of tasteless shrimp. Then I saw the waitress bring the next table a plate of onion rings. I called her over, please bring us a plate of onion rings, she did and they were amazing. The onion ring were about $6 and Pasta Mardi Gras was $18. I brought the Pasta Mardi Gras home so I could really look at it. All that was in the bowl was pasta, mushrooms and pink sauce. There was no craw-fish in the pink sauce.What a rip off. Then to top it off, we were sitting in a booth we had people coming up to us asking if we were done because they wanted our booth. For goodness' sake people we are still eating. So, Rude! and the management just watch what was going on and did nothing about it. If you were thinking about stopping in, just skip it, it's not the good food it once was and the management sucks.",

The hubby ordered the Blackened Mississippi Catfish Opelousas which was fantastic we got the oysters fried instead of blackened, everything was perfectly cooked. I ordered the salmon and scallops with lump crab, the server informed us that the salmon is normally served medium rare, I opted to have it cooked medium and it was one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had. The salmon was delicate and tender, and the lemon butter sauce was a perfect addition to the dish.  Our server was very kind and attentive..service was prompt. We sat inside with romantic mood lighting and a corner table with a view of the outside garden. When the weather is nice I suggest that you sit outside, the garden area is beautiful. Also, if your looking for a more casual experience the bar is always nice and serves the full menu.. and watching them make their classic cocktails is always a treat! I can't wait until my next visit.",

The staff have always been friendly and you can tell staff have been well trained.  As for the grub, my family has always loved everything we have had from here. No complaints at all. For my most recent visit, I knocked out their Fish PO Boy with fries and salad. Or probably more accurate is stating I knocked out some of it. The damn thing was huge, like easily two meals huge. There is nothing to the meal I could complain about. The side bread was so warm with plenty of butter to lather on it.  The side salad with ranch was great. It came with the perfect portion of ranch mixed in. Obviously the real gem was the PO Boy. The bread, the fish, the sauce, was just perfect. Loved it all. Loved it on day one and day two as leftovers.  This guy is a Pappadeaux fan for sure.  Side tip though....Keep your car and valuables locked up. There are a couple shady extended stay hotels near by and can guarantee one or two of the hotel guests have done a minute of jail time. Just saying.",

(I literally almost threw up inside a Joe's Crabshack once) In the end I was really happy we came! The restaurant had an East Texas/ Louisiana feel, the court yard was beautiful and amazing service. There were actually a lot of non seafood options for me, I decided on the pasta! My boyfriend is a lover of seafood, especially Cajun food so he pretty much wanted to try everything on the menu! The restaurant was pretty packed all night so I was glad I made a reservation!",

Quick service, great food, and we are going back again soon!! We've told everyone we know that loves seafood to come as we want to try more dishes.

Even if they don't want to leave \"negative experience\" option, can't there be a simple slot for \"My Dining Experience\"?  There should be.   * I ordered a Bloody Mary. If I wanted the fanciest glass in town, if I were on Instagram, I'd be in great shape. Otherwise, what a colossal waste of someone's art direction. BFD, tall skinny glass.   3rd, the shrimp gumbo was delicious, had great flavor, but served nowhere near hot enough. The shrimp was stringy. Soup was $9. They're not giving anything away.  Make it good.  And hot. Hotter.   If I had to guess it wasn't being HELD hot enough but it also might have sat while my bartender/waiter did other things. I mean , how would he know, at the bar that my order was ready?  Answer: he wouldn't.  The temperature of my soup was 125 max. Should be higher, 160...?  I counted 32 people working this day as servers and kitchen helpers on the floor. Question: are you telling me that no one could've brought out my soup?  The bartender who took the order was  THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD BRING  ME MY SOUP?  Which probably sat there, cooling, to my detriment, waiting for THE ONE PERSON...  * I saw 3 bartenders attempt to draft a beer. They not only had no idea, they poured at least 2-3 schooners down the drain for each one sold. It might have been more and probably was; it was certainly not less.   * See photo. Lemon wheels labeled a week old. Is that Legal?  I don't  know. But fresh?  No. And Ugh.   Look,  Pappadeaux'st is -- IS -- way better than Red Herring, errr, I mean Red Lobster. But that place is HORRIBLE. So, this place is better than horrible.",

Her name was naundee j. If the managers are reading she needs a raise she was fabulous. Now with that being said the kitchen could use some help. For apps we ordered the fondue which would have been good if it had been hot. It was lukewarm when it came out. Not the greatest. The. After that is when it gets scary. We waited AN HOUR!!!!!! For our main course to come out. A freaking hour!! That is ridiculous!!! We kept seeing people who had come in long after we did get their food which is absolutely absurd. It was our servers fault she would constantly go back and check if it was ready and would always apologize. I felt bad for her because I'm sure we got flustered with her. The manager on duty had come by maybe 40 minutes into us waiting and said she would go check what was going on and by that point we were ready to leave. Only reason we stayed was because of our server. She was just to sweet. Kept asking if she could get us some soup or salad while we waited. The food came and oddly enough it wasn't even hot. Again lukewarm. So needless to say we won't be going back.",

We had a group of 8 and our tab was over $500 and only had one server. She didn't know the menu well enough to answer our questions. We ordered appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I don't think we ever had a busser come by once. So there was empty dirty dishes that just sat there the whole wall. I can see maybe how everything was on the server and she was just busy. But overhearing the table of another 6-8 people next to us and how their orders were lost makes me believe this was our servers first serving job.  Last thing I didn't notice until after.  Husband and I ordered Arnold palmers for our drinks. It was never disclosed refills were NOT free. If we knew that, we probably would have stuck to waters. Overall bad bad experience and don't plan on going back anytime soon.",

Get there early. For lunch before 11 AM. For dinner before 5 PM if possible. There is always a wait in the evening.  Downside: acoustics are poor. If you plan to visit, by 6 PM it's hard to hear your guests.  Give it a try. Highly recommended. I don't know of any other place in Phoenix that serves comparable food selections like Pappydeauxs.",

It feels like you have  timed-lapse back to New Orleans before Katrina. This place has a cottage look to it.... with seating all around and water sprinkler everywhere.    As we walked in..... an adorable blond hair waitress smiled and asked me how many?  I said \"two\"......DID SHE SAY AN HOUR WAIT!!  I'M STARVING I don't have an hour to give. I asked the waitress can we sit at the bar she said \"Of course if you could find a seat\"....   Aghhhhh.... this place is crowded but as I turned around two seats were available. I'm running now right towards the seats!   Hooray.....  The menu was amazing every fried foods item that you can imagine.... I don't think I have ever seen so many ways to fry shrimp. LoL   I ordered the fried lump crab cakes and my hubby ordered the gritts and shrimp!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!  It was the best crab cake I ever had and the shrimp with gritts was amazing. I HATE gritts but this buttery cloud taste amazing. I think I'm crying.    Let's not talk about the trio dessert..... OMG!!! Banana pudding, pecan pie and creme brule....  Now we known for seafood this delicious in Phoenix isn't cheap. It's not super expensive but two meals, with no drinks (non alcohol) and one dessert ran us $90 without tip. So if you plan on getting an lobster bring a credit card. They start at $45.00 but to some people its worth it. I did!!!!!   I'll be here again very soon..... I'm tearing again.... lol",

As a Florida native I was really excited to try their alligator bites and they did not disappoint. If you sign up for their email club you do get a free appetizer coupon which I thought was a really good deal. The portions are huge for the price, and we all had some left overs that were still good the next day. They were really busy when we went and our waitress was super attentive even with how busy she was. The resteraunt is huge and I do recommend reservations in case they are busy (weekends and holidays).",

I also admit, the service was very good, maybe I would add another star for that EXCEPT that the rest of the menu is just plain farce. Poop. Supposed classic dishes like crayfish ettoufee, poop. Crabcakes, poop. I watched my father suffer through a horrible dish of frozen mussels thinking it was good because he didn't know any better. The prices are not nearly worth it.

Very upsetting and not only did we pay over $100.00 for lunch, we paid for much more.Hoping nobody else experiences food poisoning. ...Needless to say if the husband wants Cajun we will have to go to New Orleans! I've never used Yelp, but felt this was important!",

Our server was really chill, laid back and even though very busy always checked to see if we needed anything. Most people these days even if the place is dead will not even check on you unless they are looking to drop off the bill.   -The food is bomb, I had Stuffed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in bacon over dirty rice (recommended).  Atmosphere is fun and poppin all on a Sunday at that! I was really surprised.   -Beast Seafood in AZ hands down for the reasons above, I would definitely check it out if your in town and want some good food and southern hospitality in the desert.   5 STARS",

    "text": "Our first time dining here, our waiter seemed visibly disgruntled that we only ordered a couple of cocktails, an appetizer and soup. We just wanted to check it out.  Thinking it was just a fluke, we decided to go back again a few months later, craving seafood and a taste of the south. After being seated we noticed a tray of dirty dishes in front of our table, unattended to, and waited 10 minutes before being greeted, but were happy to finally be able to order cocktails. We waited another five minutes for water to arrive at the table via server assistant, all the while (since being seated) staring at the tray of dirty dishes from another table being unattended to. After another ten minutes of waiting for cocktails we thought we should maybe get up and leave. As we were talking about this, our waiter arrived with our drinks.  He mentioned the bar was backed up (yet, never came by our table the entire time we were waiting to let us know). We let him know we were unhappy with the wait and were just about to leave, but we decided to stay and order: crab claws and boudin as appetizers, beef filet and mahi mahi as entrees.  We waited another 25 minutes for our appetizers and a chance to order another cocktail (our waiter again didn't stop by the table).  We got a water refill by the server assistant though. You would think at this point a manager would have stopped by to check on us, but no.   The crab claws were tasty.  The boudin, when cut open, smelled and tasted rancid however.  We were actually grossed out. When the waiter came back to ask how the food was, thankfully just a couple of minutes later, us being already irate, my date answered \"this boudin tastes like shit\".  The waiter apologized and said that he would send a manager over to take the dish away.  Really?  Can't you just get the dish away from us?  Ten minutes past as we tried to ignore a dish we didn't like the smell of and eat our crab claws. Just then, the tray of dirty dishes in front of us was cleared. Just after, the manager arrived.  Instead of having the dish taken away immediately, she held it up in front our faces, asking what we didn't like about the boudin. We mentioned the \"boudin\" smelled, and then... she tried to correct our pronunciation of \"boudin\", and mentioned some tasting notes about the dish. My partner  replied, in more colorful words, that he was born and raised in New Orleans, and that that dish was not \"boudin\". She then apologized , said she would take the dish off of our check, and left with the dish. No mention of the long wait times or dirty dishes came up from her.   Our entrees arrived. My mahi mahi was actually delicious, as was the filet.  Our waiter was attentive in checking back on us.  The dessert tray came around, and we decided on a fudge brownie. When the brownie came out, in a reasonable time, our entree dishes and silverware were still on the table. Instead of clearing our last course and then giving us our dessert, we had to push our dirty dishes aside before they put the brownie in front us, along with new forks and spoons... then took our dirty dishes.   We then asked for our check, looked it over and paid promptly. We couldn't help but notice though that there was no follow up visit from the manager or even an offer for dessert on the house, considering the experience. We left a 20% tip anyways. On the way out, no management or any other staff said good bye to us.  Why two stars instead of one?  You can thank the mahi mahi and filet.  Why am I so persnickety about this experience?  Because if I'm going to spend $200 on a dinner, regardless of the dining environment, I expect at the least good service, without disagreeing and negligent management.  So close to our house, but we choose to spend a couple of franklins on dinner somewhere far from here.",

Came here most recently on my birthday with my husband and infant son.... 4:30pm on a Saturday which was early enough to beat the rush, so there wasn't a wait when we got there. We were seated promptly and our waitress was pleasant and prompt with our menu and drinks. She told me they were out of the Crab claws that came with the Alaskan Halibut Piccata entree I wanted and what the substitution would be. I was ok with the substitution and ordered anyway. Once my food arrived the substitution Jumbo lump crabmeat was a joke, I could barely see any. I told the waitress. She took it back to the kitchen and the manager came over. The manager said she'd make sure they corrected the issue and took 50% off my check and gave me a free birthday desert. The food came back to my table and was fixed with the added  crab meat that was enough to see and taste. The Bayou cake was everything. They made an unpleasant substitution issue better. I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Pappadeaux and will definitely return. The manager Arizonnia was gracious and kind.",

And the only place they could seat us was out side in Phoenix in nearly 100 degree heat ... again not something I wanted or enjoy.  But all was corrected once our meals arrived. There were nine of us and everyone got a very different entree...not one would I have been unhappy being served.   The Mixed Seafood Grill looked amazing, the lobster tails delicious,  salads were huge and piled high with salmon and lobster. Several melt in your mouth fried platters and creole favorites left nothing lacking.   Overpriced maybe, but some of the best seafood I've had for a long time. And this was land locked Phoenix which seems funny since we live steps from the ocean in southern California.",

My dad & bro like to eat lunch early to beat the \"lunch crowd\" so when we got there around 11:15 it was pretty dead, probably only about 10 other parties there. Sounds like a lot but this place is huge inside.  I don't remember her name but our server was a sweet girl & always made sure our glasses were full. And when I couldn't finish my meal she offered to box it up & even threw in an entire loaf of bread, nice!  My dad & bro are one in the same & ordered the blackened catfish with broccoli instead of rice & I ordered the mardi gras pasta. I sampled the catfish & it was delicious, literally melts in your mouth. My pasta dish was very good but also very rich/filling. I ate about a third of it & took the rest home for hubby. He loved it! If it wasn't lunch time & I wasn't so full already, I would have ordered dessert. Their bread pudding & creme brulee are amazing!!

    "text": "We went here for father's day. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, about a 20 minute wait so we took seats at the bar which was open. It was nice to see that the bar offered full service and had the wait been longer we might have entertained the though of sitting at the bar but there is limited space and we weren't sure how big the servings were, the plates, etc. So we grabbed a few beers and waited. They do have Turbodog on tap which I had never heard of before then. The bartender offered me a sample and I really enjoyed it. We weren't up at the bar long and our pager went off. We had to cash out there which is customary and we headed to our seat.  Our waitress was very friendly. We already had beers so she didn't need to get us drinks and we already knew what we wanted for appetizers so we ordered right away the and appetizers came out pretty quickly. We had the oysters Baton Rouge were fantastic to be honest with you. No complaints at all there.   For our main dishes I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette and Brandi ordered the Crawfish Platter which includes fried crawfish and crawfish etouffee. Each dish was 23.95 and neither dish was worth it. The jumbo shrimp was flavorless. All you could taste was the bacon. You could have served me straight bacon for 5 bucks and it would have tasted the same. The jalapeno rice that came with it was good though. the fried portion of the crawfish platter was plentiful and very good but the etouffee was bland.   On top of that we never got any bread until the meal came out and here's the kicker on that. It took an HOUR for the meal to come out. Keep in mind they weren't even really that busy. We had 3 tables sit down around us afterwards and all three got their food before us. And the thing is the waitress was oblivious. We had to track her down in order to inquire about our food. I feel it is part of her responsibility to know that we are sitting there for an hour without food. She said she would get a manager right on it. and when we did get the food it was brought by a manager to us but he never once acknowledged us or said he was sorry for the wait or anything. Didn't ask if we needed anything else either. Came, dropped our food off and split. To be honest with you I expected the food to be cold as if it was sitting somewhere forgotten about but it wasn't. Seemed fresh which makes me think the order never was put in and when it was they made it immediately.   For me to go to a place to eat and drop 100 bucks I expect better food than what I got and I definitely expect better service.   I was extremely disappointed in this visit.",

    "text": "I have found a new favorite restaurant.  If there is one place on my reviews where I could go for a special occasion - this would be it.  To start - the ambience...  You feel immersed in New Orleans, from the moderately lit dining hall, gaslit lamps, waiters in black pants and white aprons and wonderful music.  The food was absolutely fantistic.  I had the Crawfish Trio, which was a mix of Crawfish Etoufee, Fried Crawfish and Sauteed Crawfish.  The etoufee had a rich, dark, buttery roux and was smothered over dirty rice.    The sauteed crawdad was a pleasant surprise.  I expected a crawdad sauteed in butter, but instead it was sauteed in a spicy cream sauce.  They also served the dinner with a loaf of fresh bread baked in-house.    If you've been to Disneyland's \"Blue Bayou\", this place reminds you a little of that restaurant.  The shelfish/seafood selection is EXTENSIVE.  Like it and Loved It!  Go to this place and you will not be disappointed.  I heard they have several locations throughout the US.   When are they coming to California?!",

When our meal arrived, however, it was rather disappointing. The fried shrimp was good, but not special.  The catfish had a nice breading, however there was little flavor. The big surprise though was the French fries. The majority of them were cold. There were a few warm fries mixed in, leading us to believe that the kitchen was aware of the situation. I don't really think we will be back again. It was an ok meal for a good meal price.",

They also have one of my favorite happy hours with some limited drink specials but some nice food specials served at the bar.  When I am looking to order a meal I have to say my favorite on the menu is the shrimp brochette (large shrimp stuffed with jalapenos and jack cheese wrapped in bacon and grilled).  I while not bad, opt out of the dirty rice that is served with this dish and have them sub with asparagus or the steamed veggies.   I have had a few other things from the menu like the mixed grill and their cedar plank salmon, and once did the all you can eat lobster special they were running once.   Honestly I have yet to be disapointed by most Pappadeaux's I visit (except the one that was out of oysters).",

I've had alligator before so the fried alligator was very tasty! The fried frogs legs... well that gets a \"meh\" from the both of us. But the fried alligator pretty much set the bar for everything else.  My entre was fried oysters and fried catfish with a baked potato. It was a lot of food and we did end up getting baggies for our left overs. Our bad for filling up on the apps and warm bread.  OH yesh, you get fresh bread and butter along with your drinks. :) Awesome.  We did order dessert.. and those were very very delicious!  My overall exp' with this place was great. Our waitress was good. She was very knowledgeable and did not act condescending with all of my questions.   The atmosphere was good.. that place has good vibes!  I really don't have anything negative to say other than maybe the pricey food, but that's really it. And what we spent for 2 people, including tip, was about $100.00.   My sister would say some of the food was salty.   Would I eat here again? Yes. But I'd probably say no to the bread so I can thoroughly enjoy my entre, lol.",

Followed by limited appetizers because they were out so many things. As we ordered we were told they were out of several fish selections. 20 mins later we were told they ran out of dirty rice and had to wait 45 mins to make some more. After waiting a very long time i had little appetite.. Once our food  arrived i was unimpressed by the anount of salt it had. Every dish my party ordered was drenched in salt. None of us finished our meal or wanted to take it to go. To compensate for the wait we were offered dessert which were limited because they ran out of so many... No surprise!  I however, will compliment the waitresses. She was friendly and made our experience better.",

She was so incredibly cute, so helpful and so indescribably enthusiastic about her job as a waitress. She knew her wine, and when she wasn't sure, she asked questions and allowed herself to learn from my husband who's a big wine guy. Everything about our entre, main and dessert was perfect and the quality was like no other restaurant have been able to provide us, since we got to LA from Norway two months ago   Thank you!",

    "text": "I have never been here before and based on my experience tonight I do not see a return anytime soon. My evening started when we were seated in probably the worst seat in the house. I asked the hostess for a booth and she ignored my request. I wear a prosthetic leg, so a booth is prefered.Then she sits us at a seat that is right next to the main line of traffic and right by the door. There were many other tables available in the restaurant.The table was about to fall over because it was not leveled out. We were approached by a stuffy waiter that was snobbish and rude.  He was not delightful at all. When we placed our order , I was informed that what i wanted was not available. I asked why the hostess or he did not tell us when we sat down that some items were sold out. I was simply responded with a completely ridiculous excuse. Since my guest had already ordered I was rushed into making a selection. The waiter left and the manager came over and was far from genuine in assisting us, mentioning in a sarcastic tone that she heard I was not happy. After offering absolutely no remediation whatsoever she left. I am still confused as to why she even came by.  When our food came the lady that delivered it, simply walked up and started moving plates that we were eating our appetizers off of. She dumped our food off without a word...   On a single positive note the food was good, but I can get bad service at a fraction of the price anywhere. I am convinced that this restaurant has convinced themselves that they are too good for their guests.    Summary: Bad service, horrible guest service from every single person we came in contact with and the seating is clearly specific to what they think you are going to spend or some other type of metric that I am unaware of. I have to say that this was the absolute worst dining experience that I have had in a fine restaurant ever in my life. It is to bad, because the food was really good.",

Unfortunately it's the only location in Arizona so most of the time it's pretty crowded during peak hours. I usually sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table.   Starting with the drink options. They have a variety of mixed drinks for whatever you are in the mood for. My personal favorite is the swamp thing.   If you are an oyster lover you came to the right place! They have the best oysters in town so make sure you at least get a dozen for an appetizer. If oysters are not you cup of tea then you must try the fried alligator. Trust me...you can't go wrong with this one.  Now on to the entrees! They have everything from seafood plates, steak, fresh fish, salads, and cajun favorites. Don't skip out on dessert they have quite a selection to satisfy your sweet tooth.   The service is always great here! Everyone is professional, knowledgable, and friendly. I can honestly say this is one of the few places I trust for amazing seafood and cajun style dishes in Arizona.",

When I mentioned I had a fruit allergy not only did he ask if everything was ok he sent the manager over to acknowledge my allergies, she asked if I had any other allergies and she advised me she went over my order to confirm none of the fruit I could not have were include and continued to ask if I were satisfied and to make sure I had no issue with any food pertaining to my allergy. She inquired as she stated to make sure if a strawberry touched or if someone touched a strawberry and accidentally touched my cup would that affect me, I confirmed only of I ingest the fruit(s) would I have an issue. I am very grateful for the concern and addressing me directly to make sure I was ok. In  the past I have stopped visiting certain establishments because after ive mentioned my allergies they acted like that information was not important. The service I received tonight was awesome, the food was amazing and the extra concern was the icing on the cake. Thank you Noel and to the manager that assisted me .",

A few minutes later the manager came out and asked me about my shellfish allergy and then educated me on how they will prepare my dish to minimize the contact to shellfish and asked me if that was ok. It was more then ok, I have never had a restaurant go through this to make sure that I was ok with how they are going to prepare my food.

We had the alligator appetizer- medium, a caeser salad, Pasta Mardi Gras, Costa Rican Mahi Alexander, Arnold Palmers, and a Purple Voodoo. The alligator (my first time trying it) was cooked perfectly. Squeeze lemon on it- try the sauce it is accompanied with, or eat it as is. It is great! The seafood (mahi, shrimp, crawfish, scallops) in both dishes was cooked/grilled to perfection and the portions were more than a person can consume at one sitting. The Mahi Alexander sauce pulled everything together for me and was even a compliment to the already delicious dirty rice! You cannot see the Mahi under the crawfish, shrimp and sauce, but it was a huge 7oz portion. As far as the staff, our server, Jaclyn, added so much to our experience. She made excellent recommendations and added wit and humor to our experience. It might be hours from LA, but this will definitely be a road-trip worthy meal!",

Not knowing what to expect, I was extremely pleased with the restaurant.   We arrived with no reservations and told it would be a 20-30 minute wait but we were shown to the bar area. As I am a fan of local microbrew beer, I ordered a Four Peaks Kiltlifter My wife had her usual cup of coffee. The bartenders were happy and funny and seemed to genuinely enjoy their job. The 20-30 minute wait only lasted about 10 minutes and we were shown to our table.   The server was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in giving us a few suggestions to try. Even going to the point of letting us know what dishes she prefers in pairing with the appetizers. Since my allergy to mushrooms can cause issues, I asked if the meal can be made without them. Absolutely she replied. What happened next is what shocked us. The person running the kitchen came over to our table to make sure it is just an ingestion allergy and not a contact. She wanted to make sure that it was OK to cook in certain pots and pans. In my 48 years, no restaurant has ever asked me that. I felt taken care of from the beginning.   The appetizers we had were fantastic. We enjoyed the crisp fried alligator and he crawfish and shrimp fondeaux. The fondeaux was the best creamy blend of cheese and seafood I've ever had. Definitely one appetizer you must try.   Our main courses were equally as good. I had the Pasta Mardi Gras. Normally in restaurants when you order a main dish you can finish the entire thing. Pappadeaux loads up the plate with their food. I had lunch leftovers for two days.   All in all the meal cost us about $100 with appetizers and drinks. Not a bad price for the experience we had. The atmosphere and employees were five star all the way. Leave room for their bread pudding for dessert. It's worth it.",

We were taken to a table right away.  Once seated it was only a few moments when Chris, our waiter, came by to see if we wanted a drink before dinner.  Shortly after they came by with warm bread & butter.  I decided to order an appetizer and enjoy some raw oysters on the half shell.  They offer more than the usual horse radish & cocktail sauce.  I enjoyed them very much.  My dinner included soup or salad so I chose to try the clam chowder.  It was very good.  A bit different than what I was use to but most enjoyable.  For entree's my wife opted for the halibut and I decided on the trout & shrimp combo.  Both were great.  When we had finished our entree's Chris came by with a dessert tray that included some very tempting items.  He told us there was one item available not on the tray.  It was a multilayer cake which we chose.  It was fabulous.  While enjoying our dessert the manager stopped by our table.  We learned later they comped our appetizer & dessert since it was our first time there.  While it was very much appreciated we sure didn't expect it.  The service and food was excellent.  Yes we recommend Pappadeaux and are looking forward to dining here again.",

He was very attentive and made us feel so welcome, as if we were part of the Pappadeaux family ourselves. The fresh Mahi-mahi was to die for and the lobster was exquisite. Desert presentation was so amazing that we had to take home a brownie for later. Thanks for the great night out!",

Everyone's food arrived but mine and when the waitress finally came to check on us....she was completely surprised. She went to check and said it would be coming in a minute.  When everyone was done my food finally arrived. I ate most of it but it didn't taste that great. They took my entree off the bill and gave us free desserts but that did little to make up for the fact that 3 hours later I was so sick. I was violently throwing up, had diarrhea and chills like you wouldn't believe and the entire next day I was too weak to even move very much. Today I'm better but not back to normal. I e-mailed the restaurant to let them know and someone did call me, which was nice, but he offered me gift certificates and the thought of ever setting foot in that restaurant almost made me throw up again.  It was the Salmon Evette that I ordered so I say steer clear of that.",

The portions are huge so we usually split an entree, have an app and some wine and still get out of there for $100 and are stuffed.  You can swap out the fish on the menus with any other fish they have.  So if the menus says it's a salmon dish, you can pick a red fish or halibut or anything else they have.",

He made helpful suggestions and even learned my name. My glass (and bread, and plate) was always full. Yet another great experience at one of the few reliable chains about. Thanks!",

I go here strictly for those! They were lightly fried, large in size,tons of crab with a delectable sauce with bits of crawfish, that made you want to lick the plate. I was just there and their new crab cakes don't even vaguely resemble the former. Deep fried small ball/patties with little taste of crab and a watery sauce with unidentifiable white fish with no taste to it whatsoever. Price went slightly up and these are horrible.

    "text": "Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house.   First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area.   We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great.   There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here.   I would definitely come here again but I wouldn't be in any rush. Great for a lot of people and groups, but PLEASE make RESERVATIONS.",

Large group exiting while i'm entering-check. Yep it's going to be a long wait. But it wasn't! We were seated immediately and our server, Rio, came over and promptly introduced himself. Let me tell you this: Rio's attention to our table was first class.  He was very amiable and was patient and engaging with my too talkative and over sharing father.  Rio made us feel like we were his only customers.  He did his best to make sure that we were satisfied. Ask to be seated in Rio's section if you want great service. We ordered 1/2 dozen blue points on the half shell.  Seven of those succulent oysters arrived at our table with ketchupy cocktail sauce, horseradish and mignonette as toppings.  The mignonette was tasty and who doesn't love raw horseradish! Yummy! My Dad and I both had naked scallops with broccolini, and lemon caper sauce on the side for our main.  I specifically asked Rio for steamed veg, no butter.  The plates arrived with four scallops not three (because of their size, I guess) and a shiny portion of broccolini. I asked Rio again for just steamed veg and he happily complied with a smile and a new portion arrived within minutes - still shiny.  Rio brought another serving as well in case I wasn't satisfied. Rio really is a customer service pro! Scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked although the lemon caper sauce was undistinguished. Three servings of identical broccolini convinced me that they must spray oil on the veg in the kitchen. I just don't get that. I'd give Pappadeaux food 3.5 stars but Rio's service elevates my rating to four.",
